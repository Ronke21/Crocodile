<text>is Japanese for &quot;loan word&quot;, and indicates a transcription into Japanese. In particular, the word usually refers to a Japanese word of foreign origin that was not borrowed in ancient times from Old or Middle Chinese (especially Literary Chinese), but in modern times, primarily from English, Portuguese, Dutch, and modern Chinese dialects, such as Standard Chinese and Cantonese. These are primarily written in the katakana phonetic script, with a few older terms written in Chinese characters (kanji); the latter are known as ateji.

Japanese has many loan words from Chinese, accounting for a sizeable fraction of the language. These words were borrowed during ancient times and are written in &quot;kanji&quot;. Modern Chinese loanwords are generally considered &quot;gairaigo&quot; and written in &quot;katakana&quot;, or sometimes written in &quot;kanji&quot; (either with the more familiar word as a base text gloss and the intended &quot;katakana&quot; as furigana or vice versa); pronunciation of modern Chinese loanwords generally differs from the corresponding usual pronunciation of the characters in Japanese.

For a list of terms, see the List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms.

== Source languages ==

Japanese has a long history of borrowing from foreign languages. It has been doing so since the late fourth century AD. Some ancient &quot;gairaigo&quot; words are still being used nowadays, but there are also many kinds of &quot;gairaigo&quot; words that were borrowed more recently.

Most, but not all, modern &quot;gairaigo&quot; are derived from English, particularly in the post-World War II era (after 1945). Words are taken from English for concepts that do not exist in Japanese, but also for other reasons, such as a preference for English terms or fashionability – many &quot;gairaigo&quot; have Japanese near-synonyms.

In the past, more &quot;gairaigo&quot; came from other languages besides English. The first period of borrowing occurred during the late fourth century AD, when a massive number of Chinese characters were adopted. This period could be considered one of the most significant in the history of &quot;gairaigo&quot;, because it was the first moment when the written communication systems using &quot;kanji&quot; were formed.

The first non-Asian countries to have extensive contact with Japan were Portugal and the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Japanese has several loanwords from Portuguese and Dutch, many of which are still used. The interaction between Japan and Portugal lasted from the Late Middle Ages until the early Edo era (1549–1638). An example of the loanwords from Portuguese is &quot;rasha&quot;, meaning a thick wool cloth that was indispensable during the period, but not used often nowadays. In the Edo era (1603–1853), words from the Dutch language, such as &quot;glas&quot;, &quot;gas&quot;, and &quot;alcohol&quot;, started to have an impact in the Japanese language. Also, during the Edo era, many medical words like &quot;Gaze&quot; (meaning gauze) and &quot;neuroses&quot; came from German, and many artistic words such as &quot;rouge&quot; and &quot;dessin&quot; came from French. Most of the &quot;gairaigo&quot; since the nineteenth century came from English.

In the Meiji era (late 19th to early 20th century), Japan also had extensive contact with Germany, and gained many loanwords from German, particularly for Western medicine, which the Japanese learned from the Germans. Notable examples include (often abbreviated to ) from German (&quot;work&quot;), and from German &quot;&quot;. They also gained several loanwords from French at this time.

In modern times, there are some borrowings from Modern Chinese and Modern Korean, particularly for food names, and these continue as new foods become popular in Japan; standard examples include &quot;ūron&quot; (烏龍 ウーロン &quot;oolong tea&quot;) and &quot;kimuchi&quot; (キムチ &quot;kimchi&quot;), respectively, while more specialized examples include &quot;hoikōrō&quot; (回鍋肉 ホイコーロー &quot;twice cooked pork&quot;) from Chinese, and &quot;bibinba&quot; (ビビンバ &quot;bibimbap&quot;) from Korean. Chinese words are often represented with Chinese characters, but with &quot;katakana&quot; gloss to indicate the unusual pronunciation, while Korean words, which no longer regularly use Chinese characters (&quot;hanja&quot;), are represented in &quot;katakana&quot;. There is sometimes ambiguity in pronunciation of these borrowings, particularly voicing, such as vs. – compare English&#x27;s Daoism–Taoism romanization issue.

Some Modern Chinese borrowings occurred during the 17th and 18th centuries, due both to trade and resident Chinese in Nagasaki, and a more recent wave of Buddhist monks, the Ōbaku school, whose words are derived from languages spoken in Fujian. More recent Korean borrowings are influenced both by proximity, and to the substantial population of Koreans in Japan since the early 20th century.

In 1889, there were 85 &quot;gairaigo&quot; of Dutch origin and 72 &quot;gairaigo&quot; of English origin listed in a Japanese dictionary. From 1911 to 1924, 51% of &quot;gairaigo&quot; listed in dictionaries were of English origin, and today, 80% to 90% of &quot;gairaigo&quot; are of English origin.

There have been some borrowings from Sanskrit as well, most notably for religious terms. These words are generally transliterations which were unknowingly borrowed from Chinese.

=== Doublets ===

In some cases, doublets or etymologically related words from different languages may be borrowed and sometimes used synonymously or sometimes used distinctly.

The most common basic example is versus earlier , where they are used distinctly. A similar example is versus earlier ; thus is not redundant but means a drinking vessel specifically made of glass (e.g. as opposed to plastic). A more technical example is (English &quot;sorbitol&quot;) versus (German Sorbit), used synonymously.

=== &quot;Wasei-kango&quot; ===
In addition to borrowings, which adopted both meaning and pronunciation, Japanese also has an extensive set of new words that are crafted using existing Chinese morphemes to express a foreign term. These are known as &quot;wasei-kango&quot;, &quot;Japanese-made Chinese words&quot;. This process is similar to the creation of classical compounds in European languages. Many were coined in the Meiji period, and these are very common in medical terminology. These are not considered &quot;gairaigo&quot;, as the foreign word itself has not been borrowed, and sometimes a translation and a borrowing are both used.

== Writing ==

In written Japanese, &quot;gairaigo&quot; are usually written in &quot;katakana&quot;. Older loanwords are also often written using &quot;ateji&quot; (&quot;kanji&quot; chosen for their phonetic value, or sometimes for meaning instead) or hiragana, for example &quot;tabako&quot; from Portuguese, meaning &quot;tobacco&quot; or &quot;cigarette&quot; can be written (&quot;katakana&quot;), (&quot;hiragana&quot;), or (the &quot;kanji&quot; for &quot;smoke grass&quot;, but still pronounced &quot;tabako&quot; – an example of meaning-based &quot;ateji&quot;), with no change in meaning. Another common older example is &quot;tempura,&quot; which is usually written in mixed &quot;kanji&quot;/&quot;kana&quot; (mazegaki) as , but is also written as (rare kanji) or (common kanji) – here it is sound-based &quot;ateji,&quot; with the characters used for their phonetic values only.

Few &quot;gairaigo&quot; are sometimes written with a single &quot;kanji&quot; character (chosen for meaning or newly created); consequently, these are considered &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; rather than &quot;ateji&quot; because the single characters are used for meaning rather than for sound and are often written as katakana. An example is ; see single-character loan words for details.

==False friends and &quot;wasei-eigo&quot;==
There are numerous causes for confusion in &quot;gairaigo&quot;: (1) &quot;gairaigo&quot; are often abbreviated, (2) their meaning may change (either in Japanese or in the original language after the borrowing has occurred), (3) many words are not borrowed but rather coined in Japanese (&quot;wasei-eigo&quot; &quot;English made in Japan&quot;), and (4) not all &quot;gairaigo&quot; come from English.

Due to Japanese pronunciation rules and its mora-based phonology, many words take a significant amount of time to pronounce. For example, a one-syllable word in a language such as English (&quot;brake&quot;) often becomes several syllables when pronounced in Japanese (in this case, &quot;burēki&quot; (), which amounts to four moras). The Japanese language, therefore, contains many abbreviated and contracted words, and there is a strong tendency to shorten words. This also occurs with &quot;gairaigo&quot; words. For example, &quot;remote control&quot;, when transcribed in Japanese, becomes &quot;rimōto kontorōru&quot; (), but this has then been simplified to &quot;rimokon&quot; (). For another example, the transcribed word for &quot;department store&quot; is &quot;depātomento sutoa&quot; () but has since been shortened to &quot;depāto&quot; (). Clipped compounds, such as &quot;wāpuro&quot; () for &quot;word processor&quot;, are common. &quot;Karaoke&quot; (), a combination of the Japanese word &quot;kara&quot; &quot;empty&quot; and the clipped form, &quot;oke&quot;, of the English loanword &quot;orchestra&quot; (J. &quot;ōkesutora&quot; ), is a clipped compound that has entered the English language. Japanese ordinarily takes the first part of a foreign word, but in some cases the second syllable is used instead; notable examples from English include and .

Some Japanese people are not aware of the origins of the words in their language, and may assume that all &quot;gairaigo&quot; words are legitimate English words. For example, Japanese people may use words like &quot;tēma&quot; (, from German , meaning &quot;topic/theme&quot;) in English, or &quot;&quot;, not realizing that the contraction of &quot;remote control&quot; to took place in Japan.

Similarly, &quot;gairaigo&quot;, while making Japanese easier to learn for foreign students in some cases, can also cause problems due to independent semantic progression. For example, English &quot;stove&quot;, from which &quot;sutōbu&quot; () is derived, has multiple meanings. Americans often use the word to mean a cooking appliance, and are thus surprised when Japanese take it to mean a space heater (such as a wood-burning stove). The Japanese term for a cooking stove is another &quot;gairaigo&quot; term, , from the English &quot;range&quot;; a gas stove is a .

Additionally, Japanese combines words in ways that are uncommon in English. As an example, &quot;left over&quot; is a baseball term for a hit that goes over the left-fielder&#x27;s head rather than uneaten food saved for a later meal. This is a term that appears to be a loan but is actually &quot;wasei-eigo&quot;.

It is sometimes difficult for students of Japanese to distinguish among &quot;gairaigo&quot;, &quot;giseigo&quot; (onomatopoeia), and &quot;gitaigo&quot; (ideophones: words that represent the manner of an action, like &quot;zigzag&quot; in English — &quot;jiguzagu&quot; in Japanese), which are also written in katakana.

&quot;Wasei-eigo&quot; presents more difficulties for Japanese and learners of Japanese as such words, once entered the lexicon, combine to form any number of potentially confusing combinations. For example, the loanwords &quot;chance&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;erotic&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, and &quot;boom&quot; have all entered &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; lexicon, combining with Japanese words and other English loanwords to produce any number of combination words and phrases. &#x27;Up&#x27;, or &#x27;, is famously combined with other words to convey an increase or improvement, such as &#x27; (increased results) and &#x27; (improved quality of life). &#x27;My&#x27;, or &#x27;, also regularly appears in advertisements for any number and genre of items. From &quot;My Fanny&quot; toilet paper to &quot;My Hand&quot; electric hand drills, &quot;&quot; serves as a common advertising tool. Infamously, the beverage brand Calpis sold a product named or &#x27;my piss&#x27; for a short time.

&quot;Wasei-eigo&quot; is often employed to disguise or advertise risque or sexual terms and innuendos, especially when used by women. &quot;Wasei-eigo&quot; terms referencing a person&#x27;s characteristics, personality, and habits also commonly appear as Japanese street slang, from &#x27; or &#x27;potato chips&#x27; for a hick and &#x27; &#x27;SF&#x27; for a &#x27;sex friend&#x27;.

==Grammatical function==
&quot;Gairaigo&quot; are generally nouns, which can be subsequently used as verbs by adding auxiliary verb . For example, &quot;play soccer&quot; is translated as サッカーをする (&quot;&quot;).

Some exceptions exist, such as , which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb – note the unusual use of &quot;katakana&quot; () followed by &quot;hiragana&quot; (). Another example is &quot;gugu-ru&quot; (ググる, &quot;to google&quot;), which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb, in which the final syllable is converted into &quot;okurigana&quot; to enable conjugation.

&quot;Gairaigo&quot; function as do morphemes from other sources, and, in addition to &quot;wasei eigo&quot; (words or phrases from combining &quot;gairaigo&quot;), &quot;gairaigo&quot; can combine with morphemes of Japanese or Chinese origin in words and phrases, as in (compare ), (compare ) or .

In set phrases, there is sometimes a preference to use all &quot;gairaigo&quot; (in &quot;katakana&quot;) or all &quot;kango/wago&quot; (in &quot;kanji&quot;), as in (&quot;mansurii manshon&quot;, monthly apartment) versus (&quot;tsukigime chūshajō,&quot; monthly parking lot), but mixed phrases are common, and may be used interchangeably, as in (&quot;tenanto boshū&quot;) and (&quot;nyūkyosha boshū&quot;), both meaning &quot;looking for a tenant&quot;.

==Phonology==

Borrowings traditionally have had pronunciations that conform to Japanese phonology and phonotactics. For example, &quot;platform&quot; was borrowed as /hōmu/, because */fo/ is not a sound combination that traditionally occurs in Japanese. However, in recent years, some &quot;gairaigo&quot; are pronounced more closely to their original sound, which is represented by non-traditional combinations of &quot;katakana&quot;, generally using small &quot;katakana&quot; or diacritics (voicing marks) to indicate these non-traditional sounds. Compare and &quot;sumaho&quot; (スマホ, &quot;smart phone&quot;), where traditional sounds are used, and , a variant of the latter word using traditional sounds, where the non-traditional combination (fu-o) is used to represent the non-traditional sound combination /fo/. This leads to long words; e.g., the word for &quot;fanfare&quot; is spelled out as , with seven &quot;kana&quot;, no shorter than the Roman alphabet original (it is possible that it was not loaned from English because the &quot;e&quot; is not silent).

Similarly, Japanese traditionally does not have any /v/ phoneme, instead approximating it with /b/, but today /v/ (normally realized &quot;not&quot; as but as bilabial ) is sometimes used in pronunciations: for example, &quot;violin&quot; can be pronounced either or , with (literally &quot;voiced u&quot;+&quot;a&quot;) representing /va/.

Another example of the Japanese transformation of English pronunciation is , in which the two-syllable word &quot;taxi&quot; becomes three syllables (and four morae, thanks to long &quot;ī&quot;) because consonant clusters do not occur in traditional Japanese (with the exception of the coda ん/ン or /n/), and in which the sound [si] (&quot;see&quot;) of English is pronounced (which to monoglot English speakers will sound like &quot;she&quot;) because /si/ in Japanese is realized as such.

This change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of foreign words (here primarily from English) can be compared to the earlier posited change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of Chinese loanwords, such as closed syllables (CVC, not just CV) and length becoming a phonetic feature with the development of both long vowels and long consonants – see Early Middle Japanese: Phonological developments.

Due to the difficulties that Japanese have in distinguishing &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, this expansion of Japanese phonology has not extended to use of different &quot;kana&quot; for /l/ vs. /r/, though application of handakuten for representing /l/ has been proposed as early as Meiji era. Therefore, words with /l/ or /r/ may be spelled identically if borrowed into Japanese. One important exception, however, does occur due to the fact that Japanese typically borrows English words in a non-rhotic fashion.

==As a built-in lexicon of English==
The English words that are borrowed into Japanese include many of the most useful English words, including high-frequency vocabulary and academic vocabulary. Thus &quot;gairaigo&quot; may constitute a useful built-in lexicon for Japanese learners of English.

&quot;Gairaigo&quot; have been observed to aid a Japanese child&#x27;s learning of English vocabulary. With adults, &quot;gairaigo&quot; assist in English-word aural recognition and pronunciation, spelling, listening comprehension, retention of spoken and written English, and recognition and recall at especially higher levels of vocabulary. Moreover, in their written production, students of Japanese prefer using English words that have become &quot;gairaigo&quot; to those that have not.

==Misconceptions==

The word (Japanese for &quot;thank you&quot;) sounds similar to the Portuguese word , which has the same meaning. Given the number of borrowings from Portuguese, it may seem reasonable to suppose that the Japanese imported that word—which is the explanation accepted and indeed published by many. However, &quot;arigatō&quot; is not a &quot;gairaigo&quot;; rather, it is an abbreviation of &quot;arigatō gozaimasu&quot;, which consists of an inflection of the native Japanese adjective &quot;arigatai&quot; () combined with the polite verb &quot;gozaimasu&quot;. There is evidence, for example in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, that the word &quot;arigatai&quot; was in use several centuries before contact with the Portuguese. This makes the two terms false cognates. If the Portuguese word had been borrowed, it would most likely have taken the form オブリガド (&quot;oburigado&quot;), or maybe &quot;ōrigado&quot; (due to historical &quot;afu&quot; and &quot;ofu&quot; collapsing to &quot;ō&quot;), and while it is even possible that it would be spelled with as &quot;ateji&quot;, it would regardless start with &quot;o&quot; rather than &quot;a&quot;, and the final &quot;o&quot; would have been short rather than long.

==Reborrowings from Japanese==

Some &quot;gairaigo&quot; words have been reborrowed into their original source languages, particularly in the jargon of fans of Japanese entertainment. For example, &quot;anime&quot; () is &quot;gairaigo&quot; derived from the English word for &quot;animation&quot;, but has been reborrowed by English with the meaning of &quot;Japanese animation&quot;. Similarly, &quot;puroresu&quot; () derives from &quot;professional wrestling&quot;, and has been adopted by English-speaking wrestling fans as a term for the style of pro wrestling performed in Japan. &quot;Kosupure&quot; (), or &quot;cosplay&quot;, was formed from the English words &quot;costume play&quot;, referring to dressing in costumes such as those of anime, manga, or videogame characters, and is now commonly used in English and other languages (also using Western cartoon realms).

There are also rare examples of borrowings from Indo-European languages, which have subsequently been borrowed by other Indo-European languages, thus yielding distant cognates. An example is , originally borrowed from Russian (&quot;ikra&quot;), and possibly distantly cognate (from the same Indo-European root) to English &quot;roe&quot; (fish eggs), though the only indication is the shared &quot;r&quot;.

<text>Hemp, or industrial hemp, is a plant in the botanical class of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; cultivars grown specifically for industrial and consumable use. It can be used to make a wide range of products. Along with bamboo, hemp is among the fastest growing plants on Earth. It was also one of the first plants to be spun into usable fiber 50,000 years ago. It can be refined into a variety of commercial items, including paper, rope, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed.

Although chemotype I cannabis and hemp (types II, III, IV, V) are both &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), they represent distinct cultivar groups, typically with unique phytochemical compositions and uses. Hemp typically has lower concentrations of total THC and may have higher concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), which potentially mitigates the psychoactive effects of THC. The legality of hemp varies widely among countries. Some governments regulate the concentration of THC and permit only hemp that is bred with an especially low THC content into commercial production.

==Etymology==
The etymology is uncertain but there appears to be no common Proto-Indo-European source for the various forms of the word; the Greek term &quot;&quot; () is the oldest attested form, which may have been borrowed from an earlier Scythian or Thracian word. Then it appears to have been borrowed into Latin, and separately into Slavic and from there into Baltic, Finnish, and Germanic languages.

In the Germanic languages, following Grimm&#x27;s law, the &quot;k&quot; would have changed to &quot;h&quot; with the first Germanic sound shift, giving Proto-Germanic *&quot;hanapiz&quot;, after which it may have been adapted into the Old English form, , . Barber (1991) however, argued that the spread of the name &quot;kannabis&quot; was due to its historically more recent plant use, starting from the south, around Iran, whereas non-THC varieties of hemp are older and prehistoric. Another possible source of origin is Assyrian , which was the name for a source of oil, fiber, and medicine in the 1st millennium BC.

Cognates of hemp in other Germanic languages include Dutch , Danish and Norwegian , Saterland Frisian , German , Icelandic and Swedish . In those languages &quot;hemp&quot; can refer to either industrial fiber hemp or narcotic cannabis strains.

==Uses==
Hemp is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products, including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation, and biofuel. The bast fibers can be used to make textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other fibers, such as flax, cotton or silk, as well as virgin and recycled polyester, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are woodier and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding, and litter. When oxidized (often erroneously referred to as &quot;drying&quot;), hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a moisturizing agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well. A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the European Union was used in animal and bird feed.

===Food===
Hemp seeds can be eaten raw, ground into hemp meal, sprouted or made into dried sprout powder. Hemp seeds can also be made into a slurry used for baking or for beverages, such as hemp milk and tisanes. Hemp oil is cold-pressed from the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids.

In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs treats hemp as a purely non-food crop, but with proper licensing and proof of less than 0.3% THC concentration, hemp seeds can be imported for sowing or for sale as a food or food ingredient. In the US, hemp can be used legally in food products and, , was typically sold in health food stores or through mail order.

====Nutrition====

A portion of hulled hemp seeds supplies of food energy. They contain 5% water, 5% carbohydrates, 49% total fat, and 31% protein.

The share of protein obtained from the hemp seeds can be increased in by processing the seeds, such as by dehulling the seeds, or by using the meal or cake (also called hemp seed flour), that is, the remaining fraction of hemp seed obtained after expelling its oil fraction. The proteins are mostly located in the inner layer of the seed, whereas the hull is poor in proteins, as it mostly contains the fiber.

Hemp seeds are notable in providing 64% of the Daily Value (DV) of protein per 100-gram serving. The three main proteins in hemp seeds are edestin (83% of total protein content), albumin (13%) and ß-conglycinin (up to 5%). Hemp seed proteins are highly digestible compared to soy proteins when untreated (unheated). The amino acid profile of hemp seeds is comparable to the profiles of other protein-rich foods, such as meat, milk, eggs, and soy. Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid scores were 0.49–0.53 for whole hemp seed, 0.46–0.51 for hemp seed meal, and 0.63–0.66 for hulled hemp seed. The most abundant amino acid in hemp seed is glutamic acid (3.74–4.58% of whole seed) followed by arginine (2.28–3.10% of whole seed). The whole hemp seed can be considered a rich-protein source containing a protein amount higher or similar than other protein-rich products, such as quinoa (13.0%), chia seeds (18.2–19.7%), buckwheat seeds (27.8%) and linseeds (20.9%). Nutritionally, the protein fraction of hemp seed is highly digestible comparing to other plant-based proteins such as soy protein. Hemp seed protein has a good profile of essential amino acids, still, this profile of amino acids is inferior to that of soy or casein.

Hemp seeds are a rich source of dietary fiber (20% DV), B vitamins, and the dietary minerals manganese (362% DV), phosphorus (236% DV), magnesium (197% DV), zinc (104% DV), and iron (61% DV). About 73% of the energy in hemp seeds is in the form of fats and essential fatty acids, mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic, oleic, and alpha-linolenic acids. The ratio of the 38.100 grams of polyunsaturated fats per 100 grams is 9.301 grams of omega-3 to 28.698 grams of omega-6. Typically, the portion suggested on packages for an adult is 30 grams, approximately three tablespoons.

With its gluten content as low as 4.78 ppm, hemp is attracting attention as a gluten-free (&lt;20 ppm) food material.

Despite the rich nutrient content of hemp seeds, the seeds contain antinutritional compounds, including phytic acid, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins, in statistically significant concentrations.

====Storage====
Hemp oil oxidizes and turns rancid within a short period of time if not stored properly; its shelf life is extended when it is stored in a dark airtight container and refrigerated. Both light and heat can degrade hemp oil.

===Fiber===
Hemp fiber has been used extensively throughout history, with production climaxing soon after being introduced to the New World. For centuries, items ranging from rope, to fabrics, to industrial materials were made from hemp fiber. Hemp was also commonly used to make sail canvas. The word &quot;canvas&quot; is derived from the word &quot;cannabis&quot;. Pure hemp has a texture similar to linen. Because of its versatility for use in a variety of products, today hemp is used in a number of consumer goods, including clothing, shoes, accessories, dog collars, and home wares. For clothing, in some instances, hemp is mixed with lyocell. Its benefits in terms for sustainability also increase its appeal in industries, such as the clothing industry.
===Building material===
Hemp as a building construction material provides solutions to a variety of issues facing current building standards. Its light weight, mold resistance, breathability, etc. makes hemp products versatile in a multitude of uses. Following the co-heating tests of NNFCC Renewable House at the Building Research Establishment (BRE), hemp is reported to be a more sustainable material of construction in comparison to most building methods used today. In addition, its practical use in building construction could result in the reduction of both energy consumption costs and the creation of secondary pollutants.

In 2022, hemp-lime, also known as hempcrete, was accepted as a building material, along with methodologies for its use, by the International Code Council, and was included in the 2024 edition of the International Residential Code as an appendix: &quot;Appendix BL Hemp-Lime (Hempcrete) Construction&quot;. This inclusion in the IRC model code is expected to promote expansion of the use and legitimacy of hemp-lime in construction in the United States.

The hemp market was at its largest during the 17th century. In the 19th century and onward, the market saw a decline during its rapid illegalization in many countries. Hemp has resurfaced in green building construction, primarily in Europe. The modern-day disputes regarding the legality of hemp lead to its main disadvantages: importing and regulating costs. Final Report on the Construction of the Hemp Houses at Haverhill, UK conducts that hemp construction exceeds the cost of traditional building materials by £48per square meter.

Currently, the University of Bath researches the use of hemp-lime panel systems for construction. Funded by the European Union, the research tests panel design within their use in high-quality construction, on site assembly, humidity and moisture penetration, temperature change, daily performance and energy saving documentations. The program, focusing on Britain, France, and Spain markets aims to perfect protocols of use and application, manufacturing, data gathering, certification for market use, as well as warranty and insurance.

The most common use of hemp-lime in building is by casting the hemp-hurd and lime mix while wet around a timber frame with temporary shuttering and tamping the mix to form a firm mass. After the removal of the temporary shuttering, the solidified hemp mix is then ready to be plastered with lime plaster.

==== Sustainability ====
Hemp is classified under the green category of building design, primarily due to its positive effects on the environment. A few of its benefits include but are not limited to the suppression of weed growth, anti-erosion, reclamation properties, and the ability to remove poisonous substances and heavy metals from soil.

The use of hemp is beginning to gain popularity alongside other natural materials. This is because cannabis processing is done mechanically with minimal harmful effects on the environment. A part of what makes hemp sustainable is its minimal water usage and non-reliance on pesticides for proper growth. It is recyclable, non-toxic, and biodegradable, making hemp a popular choice in green building construction.

Hemp fiber is known to have high strength and durability, and has been known to be a good protector against vermin. The fiber has the capability to reinforce structures by embossing threads and cannabis shavers. Hemp has been involved more recently in the building industry, producing building construction materials including insulation, hempcrete, and varnishes.

Hemp made materials have low embodied energy. The plant has the ability to absorb large amounts of CO2, providing air quality, thermal balance, creating a positive environmental impact.

Hemp&#x27;s properties allow mold resistance, and its porous materiality makes the building materials made of it breathable. In addition hemp possesses the ability to absorb and release moisture without deteriorating. Hemp can be non-flammable if mixed with lime and could be applied on numerous aspects of the building (wall, roofs, etc.) due to its lightweight properties.

==== Insulation ====
Hemp is commonly used as an insulation material. Its flexibility and toughness during compression allows for easier implementation within structural framing systems. The insulation material could also be easily adjusted to different sizes and shapes by being cut during the installation process. The ability to not settle and therefore avoiding cavity developments lowers its need for maintenance.

Hemp insulation is naturally lightweight and non-toxic, allowing for an exposed installation in a variety of spaces, including flooring, walling, and roofing. Compared to mineral insulation, hemp absorbs roughly double the amount of heat and could be compared to wood, in some cases even overpassing some of its types.

Hemp insulation&#x27;s porous materiality allows for air and moisture penetration, with a bulk density going up to 20% without losing any thermal properties. In contrast, the commonly used mineral insulation starts to fail after 2%. The insulation evenly distributes vapor and allows for air circulation, constantly carrying out used air and replacing with fresh. Its use on the exterior of the structure, overlaid with breathable water-resistive barriers, eases the withdrawal of moisture from within the wall structure.

In addition, the insulation doubles as a sound barrier, weakening airborne sound waves passing through it.

==== Hempcrete ====

In addition to the CO2 absorbed during its growth period, hemp-lime, also known as hempcrete, continues absorption during the curing process. The mixture hardens when the silica contained in hemp shives mixes with hydraulic lime, resulting in the mineralization process called &quot;carbonation&quot;..

Though not a load-bearing material, hempcrete is most commonly used as infill in building construction due to its light weight (roughly seven times lighter than common concrete) and vapor permeability. The building material is made of hemp hurds (shiv or shives), hydraulic lime, and water mixed in varying ratios. The mix depends on the use of the material within the structure and could differ in physical properties. Surfaces such as flooring interact with a multitude of loads and would have to be more resistive, while walls and roofs are required to be more lightweight. The application of this material in construction requires minimal skill.

Hempcrete can be formed in-situ or formed into blocks. Such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements and must be supported by brick, wood, or steel framing. In the end of the twentieth century, during his renovation of Maison de la Turquie in Nogent-sur-Seine, France, Charles Rasetti first invented and applied the use of hempcrete in construction. Shortly after, in the 2000s, Modece Architects used hemp-lime for test designs in Haverhill. The dwellings were studied and monitored for comparison with other building performances by BRE. Completed in 2009, the Center for the Built Environment&#x27;s Renewable House was found to be among the most technologically advanced structures made of hemp-based material. A year later the first home made of hemp-based materials was completed in Asheville, North Carolina, US.

====Oils and varnishes====

Cannabis seeds have high-fat content and contain 30-35% of fatty acids. The extracted oil is suited for a variety of construction applications. The biodegradable hemp oil acts as a wood varnish, protecting flooring from mold, pests, and wear. Its use prevents the water from penetrating the wood while still allowing air and vapor to pass through. Its most common use can be seen in wood framing construction, one of the most common construction methods in the world. Because of its low UV-resistant rating, the finish is most often used indoors, on surfaces such as flooring and wood paneling.

==== Plaster ====
Hemp-based insulating plaster is created by combining hemp fibers with calcium lime and sand. This material, when applied on internal walls, ceilings, and flooring, can be layered up to ten centimeters in thickness. Its porous materiality allows the created plaster to regulate air humidity and evenly distribute it. The gradual absorption and release of water prevent the material from cracking and breaking apart. Similar to high-density fiber cement, hemp plaster can naturally vary in color and be manually pigmented.

==== Ropes and strands ====
Hemp ropes can be woven in various diameters, possessing high amounts of strength making them suitable for a variety of uses for building construction purposes. Some of these uses include installation of frames in building openings and connection of joints. The ropes also used in bridge construction, tunnels, traditional homes, etc. One of the earliest examples of hemp rope and other textile use can be traced back to 1500 BC Egypt.

==== Plastics ====
Cannabis geotextiles could be put in both wet and dry conditions. Hemp-based bioplastic is a biodegradable alternative to regular plastic and can potentially replace polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a material used for plumbing pipes.

====Wood====
Hemp growth lasts roughly 100 days, a much faster time period than an average tree used for construction purposes. While dry, the fibers could be pressed into tight wood alternatives to wood-frame construction, wall/ceiling paneling, and flooring. As an addition, hemp is flexible and versatile allowing it to be used in a greater number of ways than wood. Similarly, hemp wood could also be made of recycled hemp-based paper.

===Composite materials===
A mixture of fiberglass, hemp fiber, kenaf, and flax has been used since 2002 to make composite panels for automobiles. The choice of which bast fiber to use is primarily based on cost and availability.
Various car makers are beginning to use hemp in their cars, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Chrysler, Honda, Iveco, Lotus, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Saturn, Volkswagen and Volvo. For example, the Lotus Eco Elise
and the Mercedes C-Class both contain hemp (up to 20 kg in each car in the case of the latter).

===Paper===

Hemp paper are paper varieties consisting exclusively or to a large extent from pulp obtained from fibers of industrial hemp. The products are mainly specialty papers such as cigarette paper, banknotes and technical filter papers. Compared to wood pulp, hemp pulp offers a four to five times longer fiber, a significantly lower lignin fraction as well as a higher tear resistance and tensile strength. However, production costs are about four times higher than for paper from wood, since the infrastructure for using hemp is underdeveloped. If the paper industry were to switch from wood to hemp for sourcing its cellulose fibers, the following benefits could be utilized:
* Hemp yields three to four times more usable fiber per hectare per annum than forests, and hemp does not need pesticides or herbicides.
* Hemp has a much faster crop yield. It takes about 3–4 months for hemp stalks to reach maturity, while trees can take between 20 and 80 years. Not only does hemp grow at a faster rate, but it also contains a high level of cellulose. This quick return means that paper can be produced at a faster rate if hemp were used in place of wood.
* Hemp paper does not require the use of toxic bleaching or as many chemicals as wood pulp because it can be whitened with hydrogen peroxide. This means using hemp instead of wood for paper would end the practice of poisoning Earth&#x27;s waterways with chlorine or dioxins from wood paper manufacturing.
* Hemp paper can be recycled up to 8 times, compared to just 3 times for paper made from wood pulp.
* Compared to its wood pulp counterpart, paper from hemp fibers resists decomposition and does not yellow or brown with age. It is also one of the strongest natural fibers in the world - one of the reasons for its longevity and durability.
* Several factors favor the increased use of wood substitutes for paper, especially agricultural fibers such as hemp. Deforestation, particularly the destruction of old growth forests, and the world&#x27;s decreasing supply of wild timber resources are today major ecological concerns. Hemp&#x27;s use as a wood substitute will contribute to preserving biodiversity.

However, hemp has had a hard time competing with paper from trees or recycled newsprint. Only the outer part of the stem consists mainly of fibers which are suitable for the production of paper. Numerous attempts have been made to develop machines that efficiently and inexpensively separate useful fibers from less useful fibers, but none have been completely successful. This has meant that paper from hemp is still expensive compared to paper from trees.

===Jewelry===
Hemp jewelry is the product of knotting hemp twine through the practice of macramé. Hemp jewelry includes bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches, and other adornments. Some jewelry features beads made from crystals, glass, stone, wood and bones. The hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors. There are many different stitches used to create hemp jewelry, however, the half knot and full knot stitches are most common.

===Cordage===
Hemp rope was used in the age of sailing ships, though the rope had to be protected by tarring, since hemp rope has a propensity for breaking from rot, as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior, while seeming dry from the outside. Tarring was a labor-intensive process, and earned sailors the nickname &quot;Jack Tar&quot;. Hemp rope was phased out when manila rope, which does not require tarring, became widely available. Manila is sometimes referred to as Manila hemp, but is not related to hemp; it is abacá, a species of banana.

===Animal bedding===
Hemp shives are the core of the stem, hemp hurds are broken parts of the core. In the EU, they are used for animal bedding (horses, for instance), or for horticultural mulch. Industrial hemp is much more profitable if both fibers and shives (or even seeds) can be used.

===Water and soil purification===
Hemp can be used as a &quot;mop crop&quot; to clear impurities out of wastewater, such as sewage effluent, excessive phosphorus from chicken litter, or other unwanted substances or chemicals. Additionally, hemp is being used to clean contaminants at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site, by way of a process which is known as phytoremediation – the process of clearing radioisotopes and a variety of other toxins from the soil, water, and air.

===Weed control===

Hemp crops are tall, have thick foliage, and can be planted densely, and thus can be grown as a smother crop to kill tough weeds. Using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides, gain organic certification, and gain the benefits of crop rotation. However, due to the plant&#x27;s rapid and dense growth characteristics, some jurisdictions consider hemp a prohibited and noxious weed, much like Scotch Broom.

===Biofuels===
Biodiesel can be made from the oils in hemp seeds and stalks; this product is sometimes called &quot;hempoline&quot;. Alcohol fuel (ethanol or, less commonly, methanol) can be made by fermenting the whole plant.

Filtered hemp oil can be used directly to power diesel engines. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel invented the diesel engine, which he intended to power &quot;by a variety of fuels, especially vegetable and seed oils, which earlier were used for oil lamps, i.e. the Argand lamp&quot;.

Production of vehicle fuel from hemp is very small. Commercial biodiesel and biogas is typically produced from cereals, coconuts, palm seeds, and cheaper raw materials like garbage, wastewater, dead plant and animal material, animal feces and kitchen waste.

==Processing==
Separation of hurd and bast fiber is known as decortication. Traditionally, hemp stalks would be water-retted first before the fibers were beaten off the inner hurd by hand, a process known as scutching. As mechanical technology evolved, separating the fiber from the core was accomplished by crushing rollers and brush rollers, or by hammer-milling, wherein a mechanical hammer mechanism beats the hemp against a screen until hurd, smaller bast fibers, and dust fall through the screen. After the Marijuana Tax Act was implemented in 1938, the technology for separating the fibers from the core remained &quot;frozen in time&quot;. Recently, new high-speed kinematic decortication has come about, capable of separating hemp into three streams; bast fiber, hurd, and green microfiber.

Only in 1997, did Ireland, parts of the Commonwealth and other countries begin to legally grow industrial hemp again. Iterations of the 1930s decorticator have been met with limited success, along with steam explosion and chemical processing known as thermomechanical pulping.

==Cultivation==

Hemp is usually planted between March and May in the northern hemisphere, between September and November in the southern hemisphere. It matures in about three to four months, depending on various conditions.

Millennia of selective breeding have resulted in varieties that display a wide range of traits; e.g. suited for particular environments/latitudes, producing different ratios and compositions of terpenoids and cannabinoids (CBD, THC, CBG, CBC, CBN...etc.), fiber quality, oil/seed yield, etc. Hemp grown for fiber is planted closely, resulting in tall, slender plants with long fibers.

The use of industrial hemp plant and its cultivation was commonplace until the 1900s when it was associated with its genetic sibling a.k.a. Drug-Type Cannabis species (which contain higher levels of psychoactive THC). Influential groups misconstrued hemp as a dangerous &quot;drug&quot;, even though hemp is not a recreational drug and has the potential to be a sustainable and profitable crop for many farmers due to hemp&#x27;s medical, structural and dietary uses. In the United States, the public&#x27;s perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product,&quot; in spite of its vital importance prior to World War II. 
Ideally, according to Britain&#x27;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the herb should be desiccated and harvested toward the end of flowering. This early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality.

The seeds are sown with grain drills or other conventional seeding equipment to a depth of . Greater seeding depths result in increased weed competition. Nitrogen should not be placed with the seed, but phosphate may be tolerated. The soil should have available 89 to 135 kg/ha of nitrogen, 46 kg/ha phosphorus, 67 kg/ha potassium, and 17 kg/ha sulfur. Organic fertilizers such as manure are one of the best methods of weed control.

===Cultivars===

In contrast to cannabis for medical use, varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.3% THC and are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana. Present in industrial hemp, cannabidiol is a major constituent among some 560 compounds found in hemp.

&quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; L. subsp. &quot;sativa&quot; var. &quot;sativa&quot; is the variety grown for industrial use, while &quot;C. sativa&quot; subsp. &quot;indica&quot; generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes. The major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance, and the amount of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) secreted in a resinous mixture by epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes, although they can also be distinguished genetically. Oilseed and fiber varieties of &quot;Cannabis&quot; approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug, not enough for any physical or psychological effects. Typically, hemp contains below 0.3% THC, while cultivars of &quot;Cannabis&quot; grown for medicinal or recreational use can contain anywhere from 2% to over 20%.

===Harvesting===
Smallholder plots are usually harvested by hand. The plants are cut at 2 to 3 cm above the soil and left on the ground to dry. Mechanical harvesting is now common, using specially adapted cutter-binders or simpler cutters.

The cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry for up to four days. This was traditionally followed by &quot;retting&quot;, either water retting (the bundled hemp floats in water) or dew retting (the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew and by molds and bacterial action).

=== Pests ===
Several arthropods can cause damage or injury to hemp plants, but the most serious species are associated with the Insecta class. The most problematic for outdoor crops are the voracious stem-boring caterpillars, which include the European corn borer, &quot;Ostrinia nubilalis,&quot; and the Eurasian hemp borer, &quot;Grapholita delineana.&quot; &quot;A&quot;s the names imply, they target the stems reducing the structural integrity of the plant. Another lepidopteran, the corn earworm, &quot;Helicoverpa zea,&quot; is known to damage flowering parts and can be challenging to control. Other foliar pests, found in both indoor and outdoor crops, include the hemp russet mite, &quot;Aculops cannibicola,&quot; and cannabis aphid, &quot;Phorodon cannabis.&quot; They cause injury by reducing plant vigor because they feed on the phloem of the plant. Root feeders can be difficult to detect and control because of their below surface habitat. A number of beetle grubs and chafers are known to cause damage to hemp roots, including the flea beetle and Japanese beetle, &quot;Popillia Japonica&quot;. The rice root aphid, Rhopalosiphum rufiabdominale, has also been reported but primarily affects indoor growing facilities. Integrated pest management strategies should be employed to manage these pests with prevention and early detection being the foundation of a resilient program. Cultural and physical controls should be employed in conjunction with biological pest controls, chemical applications should only be used as a last resort.

===Diseases===
Hemp plants can be vulnerable to various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses and other miscellaneous pathogens. Such diseases often lead to reduced fiber quality, stunted growth, and death of the plant. These diseases rarely affect the yield of a hemp field, so hemp production is not traditionally dependent on the use of pesticides.

===Environmental impact===
Hemp is considered by a 1998 study in &quot;Environmental Economics&quot; to be environmentally friendly due to a decrease of land use and other environmental impacts, indicating a possible decrease of ecological footprint in a US context compared to typical benchmarks. A 2010 study, however, that compared the production of paper specifically from hemp and eucalyptus concluded that &quot;industrial hemp presents higher environmental impacts than eucalyptus paper&quot;; however, the article also highlights that &quot;there is scope for improving industrial hemp paper production&quot;. Hemp is also claimed to require few pesticides and no herbicides, and it has been called a carbon negative raw material.
Results indicate that high yield of hemp may require high total nutrient levels (field plus fertilizer nutrients) similar to a high yielding wheat crop.
A United Nations report endorses the versatility and sustainability of hemp and its productive potential in developing countries. Hemp uses a quarter of the water required by cotton, and absorbs more carbon dioxide than other crops and most trees.

==Producers==
The world-leading producer of hemp is China, which produces more than 70% of the world output. France ranks second with about a quarter of the world production. Smaller production occurs in the rest of Europe, Chile, and North Korea. Over 30 countries produce industrial hemp, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.

The United Kingdom and Germany resumed commercial production in the 1990s. British production is mostly used as bedding for horses; other uses are under development. Companies in Canada, the UK, the United States, and Germany, among many others, process hemp seed into a growing range of food products and cosmetics; many traditional growing countries continue to produce textile-grade fiber.
Air-dried stem yields in Ontario have from 1998 and onward ranged from 2.6 to 14.0 tons of dry, retted stalks per hectare (1–5.5 t/ac) at 12% moisture. Yields in Kent County, have averaged 8.75 t/ha (3.5 t/ac). Northern Ontario crops averaged 6.1 t/ha (2.5 t/ac) in 1998. Statistic for the European Union for 2008 to 2010 say that the average yield of hemp straw has varied between 6.3 and 7.3 ton per ha. Only a part of that is bast fiber. Around one ton of bast fiber and 2–3 tons of core material can be decorticated from 3–4 tons of good-quality, dry-retted straw. For an annual yield of this level is it in Ontario recommended to add nitrogen (N):70–110 kg/ha, phosphate (P2O5): up to 80 kg/ha and potash (K2O): 40–90 kg/ha.
The average yield of dry hemp stalks in Europe was 6 ton/ha (2.4 ton/ac) in 2001 and 2002.

FAO argue that an optimum yield of hemp fiber is more than 2 tons per ha, while average yields are around 650 kg/ha.

===Australia===
In the Australian states of Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, and most recently, South Australia, the state governments have issued licenses to grow hemp for industrial use. The first to initiate modern research into the potential of cannabis was the state of Tasmania, which pioneered the licensing of hemp during the early 1990s. The state of Victoria was an early adopter in 1998, and has reissued the regulation in 2008.

Queensland has allowed industrial production under license since 2002, where the issuance is controlled under the Drugs Misuse Act 1986.
Western Australia enabled the cultivation, harvest and processing of hemp under its Industrial Hemp Act 2004, New South Wales now issues licenses under a law, the Hemp Industry Regulations Act 2008 (No 58), that came into effect as of 6 November 2008.
Most recently, South Australia legalized industrial hemp under South Australia&#x27;s Industrial Hemp Act 2017, which commenced on 12 November 2017.

===Canada===
Commercial production (including cultivation) of industrial hemp has been permitted in Canada since 1998 under licenses and authorization issued by Health Canada.

In the early 1990s, industrial hemp agriculture in North America began with the Hemp Awareness Committee at the University of Manitoba. The Committee worked with the provincial government to get research and development assistance and was able to obtain test plot permits from the Canadian government. Their efforts led to the legalization of industrial hemp (hemp with only minute amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol) in Canada and the first harvest in 1998.

In 2017, the cultivated area for hemp in the Prairie provinces include Saskatchewan with more than , Alberta with , and Manitoba with . Canadian hemp is cultivated mostly for its food value as hulled hemp seeds, hemp oils, and hemp protein powders, with only a small fraction devoted to production of hemp fiber used for construction and insulation.

===France===

France is Europe&#x27;s biggest producer (and the world&#x27;s second largest producer) with cultivated. 70–80% of the hemp fiber produced in 2003 was used for specialty pulp for cigarette papers and technical applications. About 15% was used in the automotive sector, and 5–6% was used for insulation mats. About 95% of hurds were used as animal bedding, while almost 5% was used in the building sector. In 2010–2011, a total of was cultivated with hemp in the EU, a decline compared with previous year.

===Russia and Ukraine===
From the 1950s to the 1980s, the Soviet Union was the world&#x27;s largest producer of hemp ( in 1970). The main production areas were in Ukraine, the Kursk and Orel regions of Russia, and near the Polish border. Since its inception in 1931, the Hemp Breeding Department at the Institute of Bast Crops in Hlukhiv (Glukhov), Ukraine, has been one of the world&#x27;s largest centers for developing new hemp varieties, focusing on improving fiber quality, per-hectare yields, and low THC content.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the commercial cultivation of hemp declined sharply. However, at least an estimated 2.5 million acres of hemp grow wild in the Russian Far East and the Black Sea regions.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, cultivation licenses are issued by the Home Office under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. When grown for nondrug purposes, hemp is referred to as industrial hemp, and a common product is fiber for use in a wide variety of products, as well as the seed for nutritional aspects and the oil. Feral hemp or ditch weed is usually a naturalized fiber or oilseed strain of &quot;Cannabis&quot; that has escaped from cultivation and is self-seeding.

===United States===

In October 2019, hemp became legal to grow in 46 U.S. states under federal law. As of 2019, 47 states have enacted legislation to make hemp legal to grow at the state level, with several states implementing medical provisions regarding the growing of plants specifically for non-psychoactive CBD.

The 2018 Farm Bill, which incorporated the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, removed hemp as a Schedule I drug and instead made it an agricultural commodity. This legalized hemp at the federal level, which made it easier for hemp farmers to get production licenses, acquire loans, and receive federal crop insurance.
* NH 2014 N.H. Laws, Chap. 18, SD: HB 1008 (2020)
* S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §38-35-1 et seq.
** Authorizes the growth, production and transportation of hemp with a license, and directs the Department of Agriculture to submit a state plan to USDA.

The process to legalize hemp cultivation began in 2009, when Oregon began approving licenses for industrial hemp. Then, in 2013, after the legalization of marijuana, several farmers in Colorado planted and harvested several acres of hemp, bringing in the first hemp crop in the United States in over half a century. After that, the federal government created a Hemp Farming Pilot Program as a part of the Agricultural Act of 2014. This program allowed institutions of higher education and state agricultural departments to begin growing hemp without the consent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Hemp production in Kentucky, formerly the United States&#x27; leading producer, resumed in 2014. Hemp production in North Carolina resumed in 2017, and in Washington State the same year. By the end of 2017, at least 34 U.S. states had industrial hemp programs. In 2018, New York began taking strides in industrial hemp production, along with hemp research pilot programs at Cornell University, Binghamton University and SUNY Morrisville.

As of 2017, the hemp industry estimated that annual sales of hemp products were around $820 million annually; hemp-derived CBD have been the major force driving this growth.

Despite this progress, hemp businesses in the US have had difficulties expanding as they have faced challenges in traditional marketing and sales approaches. According to a case study done by &quot;Forbes&quot;, hemp businesses and startups have had difficulty marketing and selling non-psychoactive hemp products, as majority of online advertising platforms and financial institutions do not distinguish between hemp and marijuana.

==History==
Gathered hemp fiber was used to make cloth long before agriculture, nine to fifty thousand years ago. It may also be one of the earliest plants to have been cultivated. An archeological site in the Oki Islands of Japan contained cannabis achenes from about 8000 BC, probably signifying use of the plant. Hemp use archaeologically dates back to the Neolithic Age in China, with hemp fiber imprints found on Yangshao culture pottery dating from the 5th millennium BC. The Chinese later used hemp to make clothes, shoes, ropes, and an early form of paper. The classical Greek historian Herodotus (ca. 480 BC) reported that the inhabitants of Scythia would often inhale the vapors of hemp-seed smoke, both as ritual and for their own pleasurable recreation.

Textile expert Elizabeth Wayland Barber summarizes the historical evidence that &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;, &quot;grew and was known in the Neolithic period all across the northern latitudes, from Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Romania, Ukraine) to East Asia (Tibet and China),&quot; but, &quot;textile use of Cannabis sativa does not surface for certain in the West until relatively late, namely the Iron Age.&quot;
&quot;I strongly suspect, however, that what catapulted hemp to sudden fame and fortune as a cultigen and caused it to spread rapidly westwards in the first millennium B.C. was the spread of the habit of pot-smoking from somewhere in south-central Asia, where the drug-bearing variety of the plant originally occurred. The linguistic evidence strongly supports this theory, both as to time and direction of spread and as to cause.&quot;

Jews living in Palestine in the 2nd century were familiar with the cultivation of hemp, as witnessed by a reference to it in the Mishna (&quot;Kil&#x27;ayim&quot; 2:5) as a variety of plant, along with arum, that sometimes takes as many as three years to grow from a seedling. In late medieval Holy Roman Empire (Germany) and Italy, hemp was employed in cooked dishes, as filling in pies and tortes, or boiled in a soup. Hemp in later Europe was mainly cultivated for its fibers and was used for ropes on many ships, including those of Christopher Columbus. The use of hemp as a cloth was centered largely in the countryside, with higher quality textiles being available in the towns.

The Spaniards brought hemp to the Americas and cultivated it in Chile starting about 1545. Similar attempts were made in Peru, Colombia, and Mexico, but only in Chile did the crop find success. In July 1605, Samuel Champlain reported the use of grass and hemp clothing by the (Wampanoag) people of Cape Cod and the (Nauset) people of Plymouth Bay told him they harvested hemp in their region where it grew wild to a height of 4 to 5 ft.
 In May 1607, &quot;hempe&quot; was among the crops Gabriel Archer observed being cultivated by the natives at the main Powhatan village, where Richmond, Virginia, is now situated; and in 1613, Samuell Argall reported wild hemp &quot;better than that in England&quot; growing along the shores of the upper Potomac. As early as 1619, the first Virginia House of Burgesses passed an Act requiring all planters in Virginia to sow &quot;both English and Indian&quot; hemp on their plantations. The Puritans are first known to have cultivated hemp in New England in 1645.

===United States===

George Washington pushed for the growth of hemp as it was a cash crop commonly used to make rope and fabric. In May 1765 he noted in his diary about the sowing of seeds each day until mid-April. Then he recounts the harvest in October which he grew 27 bushels that year.

It is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from Washington&#x27;s diary, which reads &quot;Began to the Male from the Female hemp at Do.&amp;—rather too late&quot; is evidence that he was trying to grow female plants for the THC found in the flowers. However, the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that &quot;This may arise from their [the male] being coarser, and the stalks larger&quot; In subsequent days, he describes soaking the hemp (to make the fibers usable) and harvesting the seeds, suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes, not recreational.

George Washington also imported the Indian hemp plant from Asia, which was used for fiber and, by some growers, for intoxicating resin production. In a 1796 letter to William Pearce who managed the plants for him, Washington says, &quot;What was done with the Indian Hemp plant from last summer? It ought, all of it, to be sown again; that not only a stock of seed sufficient for my own purposes might have been raised, but to have disseminated seed to others; as it is more valuable than common hemp.&quot;

Other presidents known to have farmed hemp for alternative purposes include Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, and Franklin Pierce.

Historically, hemp production had made up a significant portion of antebellum Kentucky&#x27;s economy. Before the American Civil War, many slaves worked on plantations producing hemp.

In 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was passed in the United States, levying a tax on anyone who dealt commercially in cannabis, hemp, or marijuana. The passing of the Act to destroy the U.S. hemp industry has been reputed to involve businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst and the Du Pont family.

One claim is that Hearst believed that his extensive timber holdings were threatened by the invention of the decorticator that he feared would allow hemp to become a cheap substitute for the paper pulp used for newspaper. Historical research indicates this fear was unfounded because improvements of the decorticators in the 1930s – machines that separated the fibers from the hemp stem – could not make hemp fiber a cheaper substitute for fibers from other sources. Further, decorticators did not perform satisfactorily in commercial production.

Another claim is that Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury and the wealthiest man in America at that time, had invested heavily in DuPont&#x27;s new synthetic fiber, nylon, and believed that the replacement of the traditional resource, hemp, was integral to the new product&#x27;s success. DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp, nylon became immediately a scarce commodity. Nylon had characteristics that could be used for toothbrushes (sold from 1938) and very thin nylon fiber could compete with silk and rayon in various textiles normally not produced from hemp fiber, such as very thin stockings for women.

While the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 had just been signed into law, the United States Department of Agriculture lifted the tax on hemp cultivation during WWII. Before WWII, the U.S. Navy used Jute and Manila Hemp from the Philippines and Indonesia for the cordage on their ships. During the war, Japan cut off those supply lines. America was forced to turn inward and revitalize the cultivation of Hemp on U.S. soils.

Hemp was used extensively by the United States during World War II to make uniforms, canvas, and rope. Much of the hemp used was cultivated in Kentucky and the Midwest. During World War II, the U.S. produced a short 1942 film, &quot;Hemp for Victory&quot;, promoting hemp as a necessary crop to win the war. By the 1980s the film was largely forgotten, and the U.S. government even denied its existence. The film, and the important historical role of hemp in U.S. agriculture and commerce was brought to light by hemp activist Jack Herer in the book &quot;The Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot;.

U.S. farmers participated in the campaign to increase U.S. hemp production to 36,000 acres in 1942. This increase amounted to more than 20 times the production in 1941 before the war effort.

In the United States, Executive Order 12919 (1994) identified hemp as a strategic national product that should be stockpiled.


=== Historical cultivation ===
Hemp has been grown for millennia in Asia and the Middle East for its fiber. Commercial production of hemp in the West took off in the eighteenth century, but was grown in the sixteenth century in eastern England. Because of colonial and naval expansion of the era, economies needed large quantities of hemp for rope and oakum. In the early 1940s, world production of hemp fiber ranged from 250,000 to 350,000 metric tons, Russia was the biggest producer.

In Western Europe, the cultivation of hemp was not legally banned by the 1930s, but the commercial cultivation stopped by then, due to decreased demand compared to increasingly popular artificial fibers. Speculation about the potential for commercial cultivation of hemp in large quantities has been criticized due to successful competition from other fibers for many products. The world production of hemp fiber fell from over 300,000 metric tons 1961 to about 75,000 metric tons in the early 1990s and has after that been stable at that level.

====Japan====
In Japan, hemp was historically used as paper and a fiber crop. There is archaeological evidence cannabis was used for clothing and the seeds were eaten in Japan back to the Jōmon period (10,000 to 300 BC). Many Kimono designs portray hemp, or &quot;asa&quot; (), as a beautiful plant. In 1948, marijuana was restricted as a narcotic drug. The ban on marijuana imposed by the United States authorities was alien to Japanese culture, as the drug had never been widely used in Japan before. Though these laws against marijuana are some of the world&#x27;s strictest, allowing five years imprisonment for possession of the drug, they exempt hemp growers, whose crop is used to make robes for Buddhist monks and loincloths for Sumo wrestlers. Because marijuana use in Japan has doubled in the past decade, these exemptions have recently been called into question.

====Portugal====
The cultivation of hemp in Portuguese lands began around the fourteenth century. The raw material was used for the preparation of rope and plugs for the Portuguese ships. Portugal also utilized its colonies to support its hemp supply, including in certain parts of Brazil.

In order to recover the ailing Portuguese naval fleet after the Restoration of Independence in 1640, King John IV put a renewed emphasis on the growing of hemp. He ordered the creation of the Royal Linen and Hemp Factory in the town of Torre de Moncorvo to increase production and support the effort.

In 1971, the cultivation of hemp became illegal, and the production was substantially reduced. Because of EU regulations 1308–70, 619/71 and 1164–89, this law was revoked (for some certified seed varieties).

<text>Boothstown is a suburban village in the City of Salford in Greater Manchester, England. Boothstown forms part of the Boothstown and Ellenbrook ward, which had a population at the 2011 Census of 9,599. The village is within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, west of the City of Salford, bordered to the north by the East Lancashire Road A580 and to the south by the Bridgewater Canal. Historically, it was a hamlet partly in Worsley township in the parish of Eccles, and partly in Tyldesley in the parish of Leigh.

Boothstown lies northwest of Salford, northwest of Manchester and southeast of Wigan. Astley is to the west, to the north is Walkden and to the east is Worsley where there is a transport interchange between the M60, M62 and M602 motorways.

Once known for its mining community, Boothstown is now a mainly residential area.

==History==
Evidence of the Romans in this area is that in 1947, workmen digging in Boothstown at discovered a hoard of over 550 bronze Roman coins dating between 259 AD and 278 AD. A second hoard of coins dated 289 - 296 A.D. was found at Boothsbank in 1989.

===Manor===
In 1323 the estate or manor of Booths was held by the de Worsley family and remained with that family, held of the king by a rent of 2s, until the reign of Elizabeth I. In the 17th century the manor was held by Charnock and then by Sherington. Booths Old Hall was built about 1343 and New Booths Hall was built in the early-17th century. The hearth-tax returns of 1666 show nearby Wardley Hall was the largest residence with 19 hearths, Worsley Hall and Booths had 17 each. There were 276 hearths in the township, Worsley proper had 191. The house, in the latter part of the 18th century, was owned by the Clowes family who owned Garrett Hall in neighbouring Tyldesley. Lord Francis Egerton bought the estate from Robert Haldane Bradshaw in 1836 and Booths and became part of the Manor of Worsley.

===Industrial Revolution===
In 1795 the Bridgewater Canal was extended from Worsley, through Boothstown to Leigh. The growth of Boothstown was based on coal and cotton. Cookes Meadow Pit at Ellenbrook dated from 1760-70 but deep mining came with the sinking of Mosley Common Colliery in the 1860s. An early colliery tramway moved coal from the pits at Ellenbrook down to the canal at Boothstown Basin by gravity, using the slope of the land.

Boothstown&#x27;s underground canal, the Chaddock Level, was used to transport coal during the 19th century. It connected the Bridgewater Canal at a small basin approximately 100m east of Moss House Lane to Chaddock Colliery, the Queen Anne Pit (1810 to 1820) and Henfold Pit in Tyldesley. The keystone on the entrance to the Chaddock Level is dated 1816. The pits on the Tyldesley side of Boothstown had closed by 1870. In 1931 Boothstown Mines Rescue Station was built along with housing for the rescue team members and other staff, it is a Grade II Listed building.

A Mr Smith built a small cotton mill in Boothstown Delph by the Stirrup Brook in 1812. In 1891 Edward Makin of Garden Mill had 260 looms weaving &quot;regattas, stripes, ginghams etc.&quot; and William Yates&#x27; Boothstown Mill had 9,000 spindles and 242 looms producing fine quality cotton from 1875 until the mill closed in 1968.

===Modern history===
The M60 motorway was constructed to the east of Boothstown in the 1970s (originally as the M62). The Royal Horticultural Society opened a national garden at Bridgewater in 2021.

==Governance==

From the 11th century, Boothstown was part of the township of Worsley in the ancient ecclesiastical parish Eccles in the hundred of Salford, and county of Lancashire.

Boothstown is represented in the UK parliament by Barbara Keeley, Labour MP for Worsley &amp; Eccles South.

The Boothstown and Ellenbrook ward of Salford City Council is represented by three Conservative councillors: Les Turner, Darren Ward and Bob Clarke.

==Geography==
The A572 crosses Boothstown west to east connecting it to Worsley and Wigan. the A580 East Lancashire Road is now the boundary between Tyldesley and Boothstown and crosses west to east at the northern edge of the village. The Bridgewater Canal crosses east to west in the south of the village.

There is agricultural and open land in the south of the Boothstown area that forms part of the Green Belt. To the south of the Bridgewater Canal the Geological Formation consists mainly of the pebble beds of the new red sandstone, north of Boothstown are coal measures.

<doc id="963332" wikidata="Q1083354" url="?curid=963332" title="Ellery Queen (TV series)">
<text>Ellery Queen is an American TV drama series, developed by Richard Levinson and William Link, who based it on the fictional character of the same name. The series ran for a single season on NBC from September 11, 1975, to April 4, 1976. Jim Hutton stars as the eponymous sleuth, along with David Wayne as his father, Inspector Richard Queen.

Each episode revolves around author Queen investigating a murder, usually with the assistance of his father. The series uses some of the same dramatic devices found in the early Queen novels and radio shows. This includes Hutton breaking the fourth wall, to challenge the viewer to solve the mystery.

==Plot==
Set in post-World War II New York City (the first episode is set on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1946) the show revolved around author and amateur detective Ellery Queen (Jim Hutton), a bachelor who lives with his widowed father, Inspector Richard Queen (David Wayne). Ellery solves cases while writing his latest book, usually with assistance from his father, and Inspector Queen&#x27;s right-hand-man, Sergeant Velie (Tom Reese).

Similar to the early Queen books and radio episodes, the audience is challenged to solve the mystery. For the television series, this led to Hutton breaking the fourth wall before the confrontation scene. This gave the viewers a short exposition about the case, and leaving the viewer to put together the clues.

The final act always used the detective cliché of calling together all the suspects, with Ellery Queen presenting the solution (except in one episode when the elder Queen took over). The great detective&#x27;s detailed exposition allowed audience members to assess how they had guessed right and wrong. In some episodes, Queen&#x27;s explanation disproved the theory of a rival sleuth.

The series departed from the original stories in two respects. An element of mild humour was added by making the Ellery Queen character slightly physically clumsy, and the character of rival radio detective Simon Brimmer (John Hillerman) was created for the series.

==Production==
Richard Levinson and William Link had previously written a pilot based on the &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; character, &quot;Ellery Queen: Don&#x27;t Look Behind You&quot;, also produced by Universal. The pilot, directed by Barry Shear, aired as a television movie on NBC on November 19, 1971. Peter Lawford and Harry Morgan had portrayed Ellery and Inspector Queen, respectively, with E. G. Marshall and Stefanie Powers in co-starring roles, and Bill Zuckert as Sgt. Velie. However, Levinson and Link did not like the changes to the script made by producer Leonard Ackerman, and used the pseudonym Ted Leighton as the credited writer. NBC did not order a series from this pilot.

In 1974, Levinson and Link retooled their idea into a new pilot, this time with Jim Hutton and David Wayne as Ellery and Inspector Queen. A television pilot premiered on March 23, 1975, with the made-for-TV movie &quot;Ellery Queen: Too Many Suspects&quot;. Levinson and Link adapted the script from the 1965 Ellery Queen novel &quot;The Fourth Side of the Triangle&quot;. NBC ordered a series based on the pilot in May 1975.

A single season of 22 episodes followed. The theme music was by Elmer Bernstein. The last episode aired on April 4, 1976, after which NBC cancelled the series. The series ranked 68 out of 97 shows that season. Levinson and Link later retooled the idea of an author and amateur sleuth who solves murders into the CBS series, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

===Reception===
Richard Schickel, reviewing the series at its premiere in September 1975, called it &quot;a garage-sale period piece&quot;; he said &quot;the presence of Guy Lombardo, some ancient autos and the oldest of detective story conventions (all suspects are assembled in one room to await the results of the detective&#x27;s ratiocinations) are supposed to evoke nostalgia. They do not—and the format&#x27;s stasis is numbing.&quot;

In 1979, Levinson and Link won a Special Edgar Award for creating the &quot;Columbo&quot; and &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; TV series.

<text>Salvia mellifera (Californian black sage, also known as seel by the Mahuna) is a small, highly aromatic, evergreen shrub of the genus &quot;Salvia&quot; (the sages) native to California, and Baja California, Mexico. It is common in the coastal sage scrub of Southern California and northern Baja California. Black sage has a dark appearance, especially during drought.

== Description ==
Californian black sage is a perennial shrub that grows approximately tall. It is covered with simple hairs with some glandular hairs, which makes it highly aromatic. The leaves are oblong-elliptic to obovate in shape and are about long. The upper surface of the leaf is somewhat glabrous, while the lower surface of the leaf is hairy.

The inflorescence occurs in wide clusters. The flowers are usually a pale blue or lavender color, and rarely a pale rose color. The upper lip of the flower is 2-lobed. The style and stamens are slightly exserted. The fruit produced by the black sage is a schizocarp composed of four brown nutlets.

== Ecology ==
Californian black sage grows in the coastal sage scrub and lower chaparral plant communities. It occurs from sea level to elevation. Black sage is able to grow on a variety of different soils, including sandstone, shale, granite, serpentinite, and gabbro or basalt. It is semi-deciduous, depending on the location and severity of drought, shallow rooted, and drought tolerant by leaf curling rather than drought-avoiding through leaf drop.

Black sage readily hybridizes with three other coastal scrub &quot;Salvias&quot;: &quot;Salvia apiana&quot; (Californian white sage), &quot;Salvia leucophylla&quot; (San Luis purple sage), and &quot;Salvia clevelandii&quot;. It rarely hybridizes with the annuals &quot;Salvia columbariae&quot; and &quot;Salvia carduacea&quot;.

==Traditional use==
The Chumash people used a strong sun tea of the leaves and stems of the plant. This was rubbed on the painful area or used to soak one&#x27;s feet. The plant contains diterpenoids, such as aethiopinone and ursolic acid, that are pain relievers.

Californian black sage also produces a nectar that black sage honey is made from. This honey is typically peppery and strong, and is prized as a rare honey due to the plant&#x27;s dry climate. Black sage honey can only be made when specific rain conditions are met and the plant produces enough nectar.

<text>Maun is the second-largest village in Botswana. As of 2022, it had a population of 85,293. Maun is the &quot;tourism capital&quot; of Botswana and the administrative centre of Ngamiland district. Francistown and Maun are linked by the A3 highway. Maun is also the headquarters of numerous safari and air-charter operations who run trips into the Okavango Delta.

Although officially still a village, Maun has developed rapidly from a rural frontier town and has spread along the Thamalakane River. It now has shopping centres, hotels and lodges as well as car hire services, although it retains a rural atmosphere and local tribesmen continue to bring their cattle to Maun to sell. The community is distributed along the wide banks of the Thamalakane where red lechwe can still be seen grazing next to local donkeys, goats and cattle.

== History ==

The settlement was founded in 1915 as the tribal capital of the Batawana people, and has had a reputation as a hard-living &#x27;Wild West&#x27; town which was the economic center of local cattle ranching and hunting operations. However, with the growth of the tourism industry and the completion of the tar road from Nata in the early 1990s, Maun has developed swiftly, losing much of its old town character. It is now home to over 55,000 people.

Maun is today a thriving tourist town, infamous for its infestation of donkeys and to a lesser extent goats. These animals can be seen standing around town as the local farmers arrive in the innumerable taxis to sell their wares on the curbside.

With the influx of tourism dollars, the typical traditional rondavels have been replaced by square, cinderblock homes roofed with tin and occasionally tiles. Mobile phone service in Maun is excellent out to about , depending on weather.

Maun is also becoming a regional transshipment hub for materials and tradespeople who service both the local camps and safari centres and the burgeoning mineral exploration camps in northwestern Botswana. There are a wide variety of services in stores as well as many local entrepreneurs with welding ventures operated from the back of a cart.

Tourists often fly into the Maun International Airport. Often, these tourists hire fully equipped 4x4 cars for camping and game viewing in the parks, or otherwise fly to several tourist camps in the Okavango Delta or the Makgadikgadi.

== Climate ==
Maun has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;). On 7 January 2016, Maun recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Botswana.

The name Maun is derived from the Seyei word &#x27;maung&#x27;, which translates &#x27;the place of river reeds&#x27;. Before the arrival of Batawana, Maun was a small Yei village. The village in 1915 became the capital for the Batawana people. The capital was transferred from Toteng after victory over Ndebele King Lobengula.

== Commercial development ==
Maun is a gateway for exploring much of northern Botswana; for example it is the natural hub for visitors from outside the region to explore the Tsodilo Hills and the Makgadikgadi Pans. The Thamalakane River discharges to the Boteti River, whose seasonal high flow reaches the Makgadikgadi.

In 2011, Maun had branches of Barclays Bank, First National Bank Botswana, Stanbic Bank and Standard Chartered Bank with ATM facility.
Maun has three main hotels; Sedia Riverside Hotel, Riley&#x27;s Hotel and Maun Lodge. There are many other accommodations and campsites, oriented towards the safari business like Okavango River Lodge, Thamalakane Lodge, the old Bridge Backpackers and others.

== Education ==
Maun Senior Secondary School is located in Maun.

==Healthcare==
The Letsholathe II Memorial Hospital is the main referral hospital in Maun. Another one, Maun Private Hospital, located on the Sedia road, opened to the public in July 2021.

== Sports ==
Maun hosts the Sankoyo Bush Bucks, a football (soccer) team promoted to the Botswana Premier League in 2013-14.

== In popular culture ==
The &quot;Top Gear: Botswana Special&quot; (episode 4 of series 10), which aired in 2007, includes segments in Maun. Maun was featured again in the series finale of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; in 2024, during which Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s Lancia Beta and James May&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz 230E from the special were present, having been found a few years earlier.

The sixth and seventh legs of the 22nd installment of the American television program &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; took place in and around Maun.

The music video for &quot;Am I Wrong&quot; by Nico &amp; Vinz, was filmed in Maun, as well as in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.

The 2012 TV series &quot;Bush Pilots&quot; was filmed in Maun.

<text>The &quot;Álvaro de Bazán&quot; class, also known as the F100 class, is a class of Aegis combat system-equipped air defence frigates in service with the Spanish Navy. The vessels were built by Spanish shipbuilder Navantia in Ferrol, with the lead ship of the class named for Admiral Álvaro de Bazán.

The ships are fitted with the United States Aegis weapons system allowing them to track hundreds of airborne targets simultaneously as part of its air defence network. The &quot;Álvaro de Bazán&quot;-class multi-role frigates are one of the few non-US warships to carry the Aegis system and its associated SPY-1D radar. The American , Japanese , Korean , Australian , and the Norwegian also use the Aegis system.

When the F-100 was designed, the United States communicated that it was impossible to implement the Aegis system in ships of less than 7000 tons, for this reason, after the construction and tests, the United States Navy congratulated and recognized the capacity of the Spanish ships, in addition to the fact that the radars are higher on the Spanish ships and therefore receive information earlier than U.S. or Japanese ships.

The &quot;Álvaro de Bazán&quot;-class frigates are the first modern vessels of the Spanish Navy to incorporate ballistic resistant steel in the hull, along with the power plants being mounted on anti-vibration mounts to reduce noise and make them less detectable by submarines. The original contract for four ships was worth €1.683 billion but they ended up costing €1.81 billion. it was estimated that the final vessel, F-105 would cost €834m (~US$1.1bn).

==Ships in class==
Six ships were originally planned, including &quot;Roger de Lauria&quot; (F105) and &quot;Juan de Austria&quot; (F106). These were cancelled but a fifth ship was later added as &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; (F105) (It has some improvements compared to the rest of the frigates of its class).
==Export==

The class is the basis of the Australian &quot;Hobart&quot;-class destroyers, previously known as the Air Warfare Destroyer. The Australian government announced in June 2007 that, in partnership with Navantia, three F100 vessels were built for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) with the first due for delivery in 2014. However, this was delayed until 2017 when lead ship was commissioned. All three ships were in service by 2020.
The Fridtjof Nansen-class frigate of the Royal Norwegian Navy is based on the Álvaro de Bazán-class frigate. Five of these vessels were ordered in 2000. The Norwegian frigates were built by Navantia between 2003 and 2009. Four frigates are still in service with the Norwegian Navy as of 2023.

<text>Sparse is a computer software tool designed to find possible coding faults in the Linux kernel. Unlike other such tools, this static analysis tool was initially designed to only flag constructs that were likely to be of interest to kernel developers, such as the mixing of pointers to user and kernel address spaces.

Sparse checks for known problems and allows the developer to include annotations in the code that convey information about data types, such as the address space that pointers point to and the locks that a function acquires or releases.

Linus Torvalds started writing Sparse in 2003. Josh Triplett was its maintainer from 2006, a role taken over by Christopher Li in 2009
and by Luc Van Oostenryck in November 2018.
Sparse is released under the MIT License.

==Annotations==
Some of the checks performed by Sparse require annotating the source code using the codice_1 GCC extension, or the Sparse-specific codice_2 specifier. Sparse defines the following list of attributes:
* codice_3
* codice_4
* codice_5
* codice_6
When an API is defined with a macro, the specifier codice_7 can be replaced by codice_8.

===Linux kernel definitions===
The Linux kernel defines the following short forms as pre-processor macros in files linux/compiler.h and linux/types.h (when building without the codice_9 flag, all these annotations are removed from the code):

#ifdef __CHECKER__
# define __user __attribute__((noderef, address_space(1)))
# define __kernel __attribute__((address_space(0)))
# define __safe __attribute__((safe))
# define __force __attribute__((force))
# define __nocast __attribute__((nocast))
# define __iomem __attribute__((noderef, address_space(2)))
# define __must_hold(x) __attribute__((context(x,1,1)))
# define __acquires(x) __attribute__((context(x,0,1)))
# define __releases(x) __attribute__((context(x,1,0)))
# define __acquire(x) __context__(x,1)
# define __release(x) __context__(x,-1)
# define __cond_lock(x,c) ((c) ? ({ __acquire(x); 1; }) : 0)
# define __percpu __attribute__((noderef, address_space(3)))
#ifdef CONFIG_SPARSE_RCU_POINTER
# define __rcu __attribute__((noderef, address_space(4)))
#else
# define __rcu
#endif
extern void __chk_user_ptr(const volatile void __user *);
extern void __chk_io_ptr(const volatile void __iomem *);
#else
# define __user
# define __kernel
# define __safe
# define __force
# define __nocast
# define __iomem
# define __chk_user_ptr(x) (void)0
# define __chk_io_ptr(x) (void)0
# define __builtin_warning(x, y...) (1)
# define __must_hold(x)
# define __acquires(x)
# define __releases(x)
# define __acquire(x) (void)0
# define __release(x) (void)0
# define __cond_lock(x,c) (c)
# define __percpu
# define __rcu
#endif

#ifdef __CHECKER__
# define __bitwise __attribute__((bitwise))
#else
# define __bitwise
#endif
===Examples===
The types codice_10 and codice_11 represent 32-bit integer types with different endianness. However, the C language does not allow to specify that variables of these types should not be mixed. The codice_4 attribute is used to mark these types as restricted, so Sparse will give a warning if variables of these types or other integer variables are mixed:

typedef __u32 __bitwise __le32;
typedef __u32 __bitwise __be32;

To mark valid conversions between restricted types, a casting with the codice_5 attribute is used to avoid Sparse giving a warning.

<doc id="963383" wikidata="Q3449168" url="?curid=963383" title="Unique Master Citizen Number">
<text>Unique Master Citizen Number (, JMBG / , , , EMŠO) is an identification number that was assigned to every citizen of former Yugoslav republics of the SFR Yugoslavia. It continues to be used in almost all of the countries that were created after the dissolution of Yugoslavia – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia use it in its original form, while Croatia has switched to a new identification number called the Personal Identification Number (, OIB).

==History==

The JMBG was introduced in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on January 8, 1977 and applied to all citizens born before then and alive at the time. All six republics passed a law on the Unique Master Citizen Number.

Although the Republic of Croatia continued to use the JMBG after gaining independence in 2002 the official name of the number there was changed to &quot;Matični broj građana&quot; (&quot;Master Citizen Number&quot;), acronym &quot;MBG&quot;. Advocates of the right to privacy argued that JMBG was a piece of personally identifiable information that needed to be protected by information privacy law, mostly because it was unique and it included the person&#x27;s date of birth. When the law to that effect was passed in 2003 it was no longer possible to use JMBG on identity cards, driver&#x27;s licenses and similar documents. Even though law hid &quot;MBG&quot; from personal documents, various institutions (e.g. banks, schools, insurance companies ...) continued to demand citizens to give their &quot;MBG&quot; while signing various contracts, since &quot;MBG&quot; was natural unique identifier of each citizen. Seeing flaw of hiding &quot;MBG&quot;, on January 1, 2009 Croatia passed a new law that introduced a different unique identifier called the Personal Identification Number (, &quot;OIB&quot;). The OIB consists of 11 randomly chosen digits and has been assigned to all Croatian citizens, companies registered in Croatia and foreign nationals residing in Croatia. Although the OIB is in use, the MBG law remains in effect, and the MBG number is still issued. It is used for data coordination among government registries. MBG no longer appears on Croatian identity cards since 2003, instead OIB does, since 2013.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2001 the official name of the number was changed to &quot;Jedinstveni matični broj&quot; (&quot;Unique Master Number&quot;), although acronym &quot;JMBG&quot; is still in use.

== Composition ==

The number is made up of 13 digits in a form &quot;DD MM YYY RR BBB K&quot; (whitespaces are for convenience; digits are written without separation) where:

: DD – day of birth

: MM – month of birth

: YYY – last three digits of the year of birth

:* 000–499 – male
:* 500–999 – female

: K – checksum
===Checksum calculation===

The checksum is calculated from the mapping = &quot;&quot;, using the formula:
:&quot;m&quot; = 11 − (( 7×(&quot;a&quot; + &quot;g&quot;) + 6×(&quot;b&quot; + &quot;h&quot;) + 5×(&quot;c&quot; + &quot;i&quot;) + 4×(&quot;d&quot; + &quot;j&quot;) + 3×(&quot;e&quot; + &quot;k&quot;) + 2×(&quot;f&quot; + &quot;l&quot;) ) mod 11)

* If &quot;m&quot; is between 1 and 9, the number K is the same as the number &quot;m&quot;
* If &quot;m&quot; is 10 or 11 K becomes 0 (zero)

Note: there has been a small number of JMBGs that were assigned by valid authorities but which had an invalid checksum. Also, there are a few duplicate JMBGs in existence. The common anecdotal explanation for these is simple operator error. Reportedly these mistakes happened more often in the early 1990s. The chances of running into exceptions are reportedly low, and whether such exceptions justify questioning the use of JMBG as a unique identifier has not been scientifically analyzed.

==Example==

As an example, a valid identification number is 0101006500006; it is the number of the first male baby registered in Slovenia on January 1, 2006.

<text>The Venetian Arsenal () is a complex of former shipyards and armories clustered together in the city of Venice in northern Italy. Owned by the state, the Arsenal was responsible for the bulk of the Venetian Republic&#x27;s naval power from the Late Middle Ages to the early modern period. It was &quot;one of the earliest large-scale industrial enterprises in history&quot;.

==Overview==
Construction of the Arsenal began around 1104, during Venice&#x27;s republican era. It became the largest industrial complex in Europe before the Industrial Revolution, spanning an area of about , or about 15 percent of Venice. Surrounded by a rampart, laborers and shipbuilders regularly worked within the Arsenal, building ships that sailed from the city&#x27;s port. With high walls shielding the Arsenal from public view and guards protecting its perimeter, different areas of the Arsenal each produced a particular prefabricated ship part or other maritime implement, such as munitions, rope, and rigging. These parts could then be assembled into a ship in as little as one day. An exclusive forest owned by the Arsenal navy, in the Montello hills area of Veneto, provided the Arsenal&#x27;s wood supply.

The Arsenal produced the majority of Venice&#x27;s maritime trading vessels, which generated much of the city&#x27;s economic wealth and power, lasting until the fall of the Venetian Republic to Napoleon in 1797. It is located in the Castello district of Venice, and it is now owned by the state.

==History==
The Byzantine-style establishment may have existed as early as the 8th century, though the present structure is usually said to have been begun in 1104 during the reign of Ordelafo Faliero, although there is no evidence for such a precise date. It definitely existed by the early 13th century. However, if this date is precise, that would make the factory years old today (2025).

Initially the state dockyard worked to maintain privately built naval ships, but in 1320 the &quot;Arsenale Nuovo&quot; () was built, much larger than the original. It enabled all the state&#x27;s navy and the larger merchant ships to be both constructed and maintained in one place. The Arsenal became an important center for rope manufacture, and housing for the Arsenal workers grew up outside its walls.

Venice developed methods of mass-producing warships in the Arsenal, including the frame-first system to replace the Roman hull-first practice. This new system was much faster and required less wood. At the peak of its efficiency in the early 16th century, the Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the Industrial Revolution.

The staff of the Arsenal, who were united by their distinct professional identity, also developed new firearms at an early date, beginning with bombards in the 1370s and numerous small arms for use against the Genoese a few years later. The muzzle velocity of handguns was improved beyond that of the crossbow, creating armor-piercing rounds. Arsenal-produced arms were also noteworthy for their multi-purpose utility; the Venetian &quot;condottieri&quot; leader, Bartolomeo Colleoni, is usually given credit as being the first to mount the Arsenal&#x27;s new lighter-weight artillery on mobile carriages for field use.

The Arsenal&#x27;s main gate, the &quot;Porta Magna&quot;, was built around 1460 and was one of the first works of Venetian Renaissance architecture. It was based on the Roman Arch of the Sergii, a triumphal arch in Pula in Istria, now in Croatia but then Venetian territory. It was perhaps built by from a design by Jacopo Bellini. Two marble lions looted from Piraeus near Athens, situated beside it were added in 1687. One of the lions, known as the Piraeus Lion, has notable runic defacements that were probably carved into it by Scandinavian mercenaries in the 11th century.

In the late 16th century, the Arsenal&#x27;s designers experimented with larger ships as platforms for heavy naval guns. The largest was the galleass, already used at the Battle of Lepanto (1571) against the Ottoman Turks, and developed from the old merchanting &quot;great galley&quot;. It was huge, propelled by both sails and oars, with guns mounted on wheeled carriages along the sides in the modern fashion. It was slow and unwieldy in battle, however, and few were ever built. The galleon, also developed at the Arsenal, was an armed sailing ship, a slimmer version of the merchant &quot;round ship&quot;. It was useful in major naval battles, but not in the small bays and off the extensive lee shores of the Dalmatian coast.

Significant parts of the Arsenal were destroyed under Napoleonic rule, and later rebuilt to enable the Arsenal&#x27;s present use as a naval base. It is also used as a research center and an exhibition venue during the Venice Biennale, and is home to a historic boat preservation center.

==Mass production==

The Venetian Arsenal&#x27;s ability to mass-produce galleys on an almost assembly-line process was unique for its time and resulted in possibly the single largest industrial complex in Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution. So much so, that it was mentioned in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;:
The Arsenal&#x27;s capacity for production was rare in a time when &quot;most of Europe had no manufacturing abilities more efficient than the guild system, the slow and tradition-bound way craftsmen had of passing on skills to their sons or apprentices while monopolizing production and sale of craft pieces in a given region... The Arsenal was something different, a harbinger of future times.&quot;

The Venetian Arsenal was not the mass production facility that it was to become until about 1320 with the creation of the &quot;Arsenale Nuovo&quot;. The &quot;Arsenale Nuovo&quot; was simply a larger and more efficient version of the original. Prior to this time the Arsenal had served mainly as a place to maintain privately built ships. With the creation of the &quot;Arsenale Nuovo&quot;, and the development and introduction of the Great Galley, the Venetian Arsenal would start to take on its industrial form. The invention of the Great Galley itself is significant because they were able to be built frame-first. This process used less timber than the earlier hull-first building system, resulting in much faster build times. This was crucial to the process that would lead to the Arsenal becoming a mass-production center. By the 16th century, the Arsenal had become the most powerful and efficient shipbuilding enterprise in the world. Not only did it supply ships, rigging, and other nautical supplies, it was also a major munitions depot for the Venetian navy and was capable of outfitting and producing fully equipped merchant or naval vessels at the rate of one per day.

In the rest of Europe the production of a similar sized vessel could often take months. This large production capacity was a result of the massive number of people that the Arsenal employed, almost 16,000, and the streamlining of production within the Arsenal itself. Production was divided into three main stages: framing, planking and cabins, and final assembly. Each stage employed its own workers who specialized in that particular stage of production as well as using standardized parts to produce an almost assembly-line process. The Arsenal often kept up to 100 galleys in different stages of production and maintenance. That way, once a galley was launched, another could be immediately put into the finishing stages of production. The layout of the Arsenal itself was modified to enable minimal handling of materials during the stages of production. The Arsenal also saw the use of standardized, interchangeable parts.

One revolutionary aspect of the Arsenal was its employment of the moving assembly line. The galleys, through the use of a canal, were moved along during their stages of construction, allowing them to be brought to the materials and workers, instead of the materials and workers going to the galley itself. This assembly approach was repeated in the rest of the world only starting from the early 20th century when Ransom E. Olds began using the modern assembly line, which was later changed into a moving assembly line by Henry Ford.

==Galileo==
In 1593, Galileo became a consultant to the Arsenal, advising military engineers and instrument makers and helping to solve shipbuilders&#x27; problems, many of them relating to matters of ballistics. He was also responsible for creating some major innovations in the production and logistics of the Arsenal. As a result of his interactions with the Arsenal, Galileo published a book later in his life addressing a new field of modern science, that concerned with the strength and resistance of materials. This science largely saw its roots in the knowledge of the shipwrights of the Venetian Arsenal. It is also supposed that Galileo&#x27;s initial visits to the Arsenal were as a result of his initiative to further investigate Aristotle&#x27;s questions concerning shipbuilding and navigation, found in the Mechanical Questions of Aristotle. As a result of these investigations, which were pursued by observing the work of the shipwrights, Galileo was asked to help in resolving a specific problem with the rowing units of the galleys. As a result of his study of Aristotle, and in particular Question 4 regarding the propulsion of ships by oar, Galileo was able to produce a response to this question and ended up becoming a major source of information for the shipbuilders of the Arsenal concerning matters of rowing, instruments, and ballistics.

==Venice&#x27;s naval power==
Venice&#x27;s wealth and power rested in its ability to control trade in the Mediterranean. This would not have been possible without an extremely large navy and merchant force. By 1450, over 3,000 Venetian merchant ships were in operation, both as supply ships for Venetian merchants and as warships for the Venetian navy. The fleet required constant maintenance and outfitting. The Venetian Arsenal was not only able to function as a major shipyard, but was also responsible for these routine maintenance stops that most Venetian galleys required. This required financing, for which the Venetian government spent almost 10% of its revenues. This naval power resulted in the domination of Mediterranean commerce. Venice&#x27;s leading families, largely merchants and noblemen, were responsible for creating some of the grandest palaces and employing some of the most famous artists ever known. This opulence and wealth would not have been possible without the naval force constructed by the Arsenal. With the creation of the Great Galley and the mass production capacity of the Arsenal, &quot;the fleets of Venice were the basis for the greatest commercial power the European world had yet seen&quot;.

==Current use ==
After years of disuse and neglect, parts of the Venetian Arsenal complex have been modernized and repurposed to serve as the operations centre for Venice&#x27;s MOSE Project, a flood defence system intended to protect the Venetian Lagoon from tidal flooding.

==Other arsenals==
Venice built also a network of Venetian arsenals, serving primarily the purpose of repair, and naval stations in Greece, including shipyards in the Aegean Sea, Epirus, the Peloponnese and the Kingdom of Candia (modern Crete). Such locations included Corfu, Methoni, Koroni, Chalkis, Preveza, Chania and Heraklion.

<doc id="963395" wikidata="Q666903" url="?curid=963395" title="Brainwashed (George Harrison album)">
<text>Brainwashed is the twelfth and final studio album by the English rock musician George Harrison. It was released posthumously on 18 November 2002, almost a year after his death at age 58, and 15 years after his previous studio album, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. Recordings began over a decade before Harrison&#x27;s death but were repeatedly delayed. The album&#x27;s overdubs were completed by his son Dhani, session drummer Jim Keltner, and longtime friend and collaborator Jeff Lynne.

&quot;Brainwashed&quot; reached the top 30 in the UK and the top 20 in the US, and received mostly favourable reviews. The album includes the singles &quot;Stuck Inside a Cloud&quot; and &quot;Any Road&quot;. The instrumental &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, while &quot;Any Road&quot; was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

==History==
Harrison began recording the tracks that eventually were issued on &quot;Brainwashed&quot; as early as 1988 (with &quot;Any Road&quot; being written during the making of a video for &quot;This Is Love&quot; from the album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;) and continued to do so in a sporadic manner over the next decade and a half, but mainly from July 1999 to October 2001. Progress was delayed by business problems with Harrison&#x27;s former manager, Denis O&#x27;Brien, as well as his work with the Traveling Wilburys and Ravi Shankar, and by his work on &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;. In an interview in 1999, Harrison announced the title of his next album to be &quot;Portrait of a Leg End&quot;, and played songs entitled &quot;Valentine&quot;, &quot;Pisces Fish&quot; and &quot;Brainwashed&quot;. During the promotion for the 2001 re-release of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Harrison joked that the name of the album would be &quot;Your Planet Is Doomed – Volume One&quot;. After recuperating from being attacked in his home on 30 December 1999 by a man with paranoid schizophrenia, Harrison focused on finishing the album, simultaneously sharing his ideas for all its details (from the sound of the finished songs to the album&#x27;s artwork) with his son Dhani – information that ultimately proved very valuable, as Dhani helped to complete the album after his father&#x27;s death.

Harrison successfully battled throat cancer in 1997; in 2001 he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and radiotherapy for lung cancer which had metastasised to his brain. Once he realised it was an irreversible situation, he worked further on the album&#x27;s songs – in conjunction with Dhani and his old collaborator Jeff Lynne – for as long as possible. Harrison&#x27;s final work on the album was carried out at a recording studio in Switzerland shortly before his trip to the United States for cancer treatment. On 29 November 2001, Harrison died before he could finish the project, but with a guide to completing it in the hands of his son and Lynne.

After a few months away from the project, both Lynne and Dhani returned to working on Harrison&#x27;s final songs and added the appropriate instruments, as per his specifications, to the recordings. The project was so close to completion that the two used the exact timetable and session bookings that Harrison himself had originally planned.

Lynne reflected on &quot;Brainwashed&quot; in 2020: &quot;His life was in those final songs, the things he got up to each day, like riding down the River Thames. Lots of very personal stuff. Some of them are really good. We gradually just filled them in. It was just about mixing them and making them sound like George would like them. You just had to go with your gut feeling.&quot;

&quot;Run So Far&quot; had previously appeared on Eric Clapton&#x27;s album &quot;Journeyman&quot; (backed by Harrison), 13 years before finally being available in a version sung by its original writer. The original Clapton recording featured a third verse not included here.

==Release==
The album was issued on LP and CD. A limited-edition CD box was also released, containing a &quot;Brainwashed&quot; poster, a Dark Horse sticker, a guitar pick with George&#x27;s signature on it, and a bonus DVD with a seven-minute featurette about the making of the album. The album sold respectably, reaching number 18 in the US and going gold, and number 29 in the UK, where &quot;Any Road&quot; became a top 40 hit single in spring 2003. A live tribute to Harrison by an assembly of his musical contemporaries, titled Concert for George, took place at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall simultaneously with the release of the album.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Brainwashed&quot; was released on 19 November 2002 to mostly favourable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album scores 77, based on 16 reviews, which means &quot;generally favorable&quot;.

Writing in &quot;Uncut&quot;, Nick Hasted described it as &quot;the best solo record by a Beatle since McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; (1989)&quot;. Although he found that &quot;a certain monotony creeps in towards the end&quot;, Hasted wrote that &quot;Harrison&#x27;s songs and singing represent a burst of form&quot;. 

Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; concluded his review by writing: &quot;Harrison never seemed to recognize the difference between philosophical profundities and the sound of a catchy song, and that may have been his greatest gift to the world. &quot;Brainwashed&quot; offers a fine, final reminder of that gift.&quot; 

&quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Gary Glauber found the album &quot;phenomenal&quot; and &quot;easily ... Harrison&#x27;s best solo effort since &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;&quot;. He said it was &quot;spiritual and uplifting in a way that serves to remind how much this undervalued Beatle will be missed&quot; and &quot;in turns funny, serious, philosophical, precious and ultimately enjoyable&quot;.

===Accolades===
In 2004, &quot;Brainwashed&quot; &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album, as well as Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (for the track &quot;Any Road&quot;). That same year, Harrison&#x27;s former bandmate Paul McCartney named &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; as one of his all-time favourites. In 2009, three of the tracks from &quot;Brainwashed&quot; were included on Harrison&#x27;s career-spanning compilation album, &quot;Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison&quot;: &quot;Any Road&quot;, &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; and &quot;Rising Sun&quot;.

<text>Sofia Vasil Levski Airport () is the main international airport of Bulgaria, located east of the centre of the capital Sofia. In 2019 the airport surpassed 7 million passengers for the first time. The airport serves as the home base for BH Air, Bulgaria Air, European Air Charter and GullivAir, and as a base for both Ryanair and Wizz Air. The airport also houses the Bulgarian Air Force&#x27;s Vrazhdebna Air Base.

==History==
===Early years===
On 16 September 1937, Tsar Boris III signed a decree which declared land within the Village of Vrazhdebna be allocated for the construction of an airport. Construction then began on the site, which was from the city centre. Two years later in 1939, Sofia Airport opened its first passenger waiting room, and after another two years was followed by a fully constructed airfield with a fully paved runway.

From June through September 1938, Yugoslav airline Aeroput connected Sofia with Belgrade thrice weekly using Lockheed Model 10 Electra planes.

During the Second World War, the facilities were used by the military. Mail, perishable freight and passenger operations began in 1947 from buildings on the north side of the airport. The passenger terminal (now Terminal 1) on the south side was completed during the Second World War in the manner of a then-modern European railway terminus to designs by the architect Ivan Marangozov. It opened after several years of delay in 1947. The structure comprised a government wing to the west, an international handling area in the middle, and a domestic handling area to the east. At that time, it was planned that the airport would eventually have two intersecting runways at a 30-degree angle to each other. 

The terminal had substantially reached its capacity of some 600,000 passengers a year by the later 1960s and was subjected to a number of refurbishments and extensions beginning in the spring of 1968. In 1975, a new international arrivals handling extension was opened to the west of the building, the domestic area to the east was enlarged, the government handling area was removed to a dedicated terminal some distance to the west, a VIP handling area opened in the old terminal, apron area was extended to the east and new taxiways opened. A bonded warehouse opened to the east of the terminal square in 1969 and several new hangars followed to the east of the first maintenance base in the 1970s. A new checked baggage handling system opened to the north of the building in the early 1980s, cosmetic and traffic reorganising refurbishments were carried out in 1990, with a substantial landside extension following in 2000.

By the late 1970s, the terminal was handling in the region of three million passengers a year, a million of them on domestic routes. Passenger numbers fell off sharply after the 1979 CMEA (&quot;Comecon&quot;) oil price shock and recovered to just over a million a year by the late 1980s. In the early and mid-1990s, domestic traffic practically ceased, while foreign traffic reduced significantly. The latter began growing apace in the late 1990s and early 2000s to reach its current levels. The terminal was last refurbished partially in 1990. In 2000, it underwent a wholesale update in which the international arrivals area was moved to the east wing where domestic handling had been, the former international arrivals area to the west was closed, and the layout of the central international departures area was changed in line with world developments. Despite the work to the old terminal, the airport was becoming overwhelmed with passenger traffic.

Options for different airport developments began to be examined in the mid-1960s. One option was to relocate the facility to a new site, with some locations up to from Sofia. Another option involved extending the airport&#x27;s area radically to the north-east and gradually removing the focus of the airport there. A third option was to develop substantially the same site. By the later 1980s, the authorities had settled on the last option. 

===Development since the 1990s===
Jes Air launched a flight to Ottawa using Airbus A310s in June 1991. The following December, Balkan Bulgarian Airlines commenced direct service to New York City aboard Boeing 767s. Project design, involving a new terminal to the east of the old facility, a new runway to the north of (and parallel to) the existing runway, and taxiways, was completed by the mid-1990s. A finance package involving very significant European and Kuwaiti investment was initially agreed in 1998 and was in place by 2000. Work began in 2001. The new runway and some taxiways were completed in mid-2006. Terminal 2 was formally inaugurated on 27 December 2006.

Design and construction of a new control tower was discussed in 2006 but this project appeared to be in abeyance by 2008. Over the years, Sofia Airport has been criticised for its lack of world class air freight facilities and for some access problems. Passengers to and from the Bulgarian interior have to access or egress the airport through crowded rail and coach facilities in central Sofia. A rail link has been discussed on several occasions since the 1960s. The next best thing, perhaps, was the extension of Sofia Metro Line 1 some 5 km from Blvd Tsarigradsko shose. This was opened on 2 April 2015 under the name Sofia Airport Metro Station. The airport metro station is adjacent to Terminal 2. Connection with terminal 1 is by free shuttle bus.

The airport is occasionally criticised as a source of environmental noise and pollution and strict noise abatement procedures have been enforced for departing traffic since the mid-1970s, while arriving traffic is generally routed to approach the field from the east, clear of Sofia.

A significant and recurring operational criticism of Sofia Airport has concerned its historical lack of all-weather operations capability. Though the new runway was designed for ICAO Category 3 operations, in 2007 it emerged that radio interference from security fencing, and most significantly from a large newly built lorry park, prevented certification (and hence use) of the associated radio navigational aids. During the winter months, the airport, located on a high alluvial plain surrounded by mountains, suffers from very significant and frequent fog precipitation. In such circumstances, flights are redirected to diversion airports in Bulgaria or neighbouring countries, lengthening journeys by many hours.

On 3 June 2016, the Bulgarian government launched a tender for the operation of Sofia Airport. Expected to bring in 1.2 billion lev (600 million euro) to the state over 35 years, the tender has reportedly attracted interest from the operators of airports in Munich, Frankfurt, Zurich, Lyon, Dublin and London-Heathrow and as well as other operators.

As of 22 July 2020, the concessionaire of Sofia Airport is the Sof Connect consortium, consisting of the French investment fund Meridiam (99% stake) and Austria&#x27;s Strabag (1% stake). The concession period runs for 35 years. The airport&#x27;s operator for the first 12 years of the concession period will be Munich Airport International. On 20 April 2021, SOF Connect AD officially became the concessionaire of the airport.

As of 17 February 2025 the airport was officially named after the Apostle of Freedom and Bulgarian National hero Vasil Levski with a decree of the President of the Republic of Bulgaria Rumen Radev.

===Airport reconstruction===

As a result of growing air traffic and passenger numbers, the airport facilities struggled to cope despite several expansions in the years prior. Planning began in the 1990s for a new terminal to be constructed at the airport. The new runway was offset from the old by with the eastern end crossing the Iskar River bed on a specially constructed bridge. New taxiways were also constructed, allowing for 22 aircraft movements per hour. The old runway was then to be used as a taxiway only. The new runway and taxiways were opened in mid-2006, and Terminal 2 formally opened in late 2006.

The total cost of the project was planned at 200 million euros. Finance was secured in 1997–98 from the European Investment Bank (60 million euro), Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (12.3 million Kuwaiti dinars, approximately 41.5 million euro), and the European Union PHARE Programme (7.6 million euro). In August 2000, an ISPA grant of 50 million euro was allocated and in December the financing memorandum was signed.

The construction works were in two lots: the new terminal with its surrounding infrastructure and the new runway. The first lot was allocated to the German branch of Austrian company Strabag, while the second was won by a consortium of Kuwaiti company Mohamed Abdulmohsin al-Kharafi &amp; Sons and UAE-based Admak General Contracting Company.

The initial completion deadline for the new terminal was 15 December 2004 to a total budget of 112.2 million euro. Immediately after work started, Strabag contested the geological surveys by Dutch consultants NACO B.V. and demanded additional funding for unexpected additional works. The delay was ten months, and construction resumed after the Bulgarian government agreed to augment the project&#x27;s value by 4.8 million euro and extend the deadline to 31 August 2005.

In 2004 Strabag demanded an additional 6 million euro due to rising steel prices. The Ministry of Transportation rejected the claim, backed by a report from NACO. In May 2005, the contractor threatened to take the case to international arbitration. In August 2005, it became clear that Strabag would not be able to meet the changed deadline, slippage being put at six to eight weeks. In November 2005, Strabag asked for eight months&#x27; further extension.

==Infrastructure==
===Control tower===
A new control tower was inaugurated officially on 5 December 2012 by the PM Boyko Borisov and the minister of transport Ivaylo Moskovski.

The tower was built by Glavbolgarstroy AD. The contract for building the tower was signed on 19 August 2011 in the presence of Ivaylo Moskovski, minister of transport, information technology and communications, the BULATSA director general Diyan Dinev, Glavbolgarstroy AD chief executive director Pavel Kalistratov and Glavbolgarstroy AD executive director and management board member Nina Stoyanova signed the design execution and construction contract between BULATSA and Glavbolgarstroy AD for the new control tower at Sofia Airport (Sofia tower). Glavbolgartroy AD were selected as contractor, as they were awarded the highest technical rating during the public procurement procedure having proposed the shortest construction timeframe. This project was financed entirely by BULATSA.

===Runway system===
On 31 August 2006, Sofia Airport put its new runway system into operation, replacing the old and out-of-date facilities. The new runway is offset to the north of the old runway, with the eastern end of its long strip crossing over the Iskar river bed on a specially constructed bridge. New rapid and connecting taxiways were built to open way for 20 aircraft movements per hour at a high level of safety. The navigational aids installed on the new runway enable landing operations under low visibility conditions at category IIIB of the ICAO standards.

Two de-icing platforms were constructed to allow centralised de-icing procedures in winter. They are one element in the overall strategy of Sofia Airport for environmental protection and reduction of the harmful effects resulting from the airport operations. At the moment there is another de-icing platform under construction.

===Lufthansa Technik Sofia===
Lufthansa Technik Sofia was founded in late 2007 as a joint venture between Lufthansa Technik (75.1%) and the Bulgarian Aviation Group (24.9%). With the foundation of Lufthansa Technik Sofia, the Lufthansa Technik Group has created a fifth platform for the overhaul and maintenance of narrowbody aircraft in Europe. The Bulgarian facility serves customers in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The facility has undergone a major reconstruction and an upgrade and now can handle the heaviest stage of aircraft maintenance checks, D-Check, that is now being carried out in Bulgaria. The company have started with more than 350 staff trained in Bulgaria and at Lufthansa Technik facilities in Shannon Base Maintenance operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 with one Airbus A321 from Lufthansa as the first customer. At the moment the facility in Sofia has more than 1100 employees and plans by the 2018 to hire another 200 employees to reach a total of 1300 employees. The company have completed the building of a new facility in October 2017 which will be used for the maintenance of wide-bodied aircraft and is able to handle Airbus A380. With the completion of the new hangar now Lufthansa Technik Sofia has 8 production lines which is turning the Bulgarian unit into the biggest unit of Lufthansa Technik.

===Rose Air Technik===
On 4 July 2018, Rose Air in cooperation with Wizz Air opened a new maintenance base at Sofia Airport. It is located at the northern part of the airport. The hangar lies on 5000 square meters and has three production lines with overall capacity of 300 planes per year and it can handle C-Check. The base started with more than 100 staff. This will be the first maintenance base for Wizz Air in the Balkans and the fourth in Europe.

===Vrazhdebna Air Base===
The Vrazhdebna Air Base (also Vrajdebna Air Base) is located at the airport. Operated by the Bulgarian Air Force, it is home to the 16th Transport Squadron.

==Terminals==

===Terminal 1===
This terminal was built in the 1930s and opened on 16 September 1937. It has been extended many times, and had a renovation in 2000. Terminal 1 serves low-cost and charter carriers with Wizz Air, easyJet and European Air Charter being the primary tenants. This smaller of the two terminals, consisting of only one main level, features a central check-in hall with 19 counters, two security screening and customs areas and a central waiting area split into two equal sections containing overall seven departure gates for bus boarding.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 was officially opened on 27 December 2006 with the symbolic arrival of Bulgaria Air flight FB 408 from Brussels. It was one of the biggest projects in Bulgaria to receive funds from the EU ISPA programme. The price included the new terminal, new aircraft parking aprons, upgrading the existing aircraft parking aprons and the construction of connecting taxiways. The terminal has seven air-bridges (gates A1, B5–9 and C1), 38 check-in desks and covers an area of and has a car park for 820 vehicles. It is located to the east of Terminal 1 and is significantly bigger than the old one which continues to serve low-cost and charter airlines. From 16 January 2017 on Terminal 2 currently serves only one low-cost airline - Ryanair.

For the first time in Bulgaria, a terminal has airbridge-equipped gates instead of relying on airside buses.

At the eastern end of the Terminal, a terminus for Line 1 of the Sofia Metro has been built under the name Sofia Airport Metro Station. It was brought into service on 2 April 2015. The journey between airport and central Sofia takes about 20 minutes with service provided during 05:30-24:00 hrs.

The infrastructure surrounding the building was expected to be completed in 2007. It includes a new dual carriageway road connecting the terminal to the existing airport road, and landscaping including an artificial lake and a fountain. Terminal 2 is designed with special attention to disabled passengers. Their access to the different terminal levels and the multi-storey car park is facilitated via lifts and escalators.

===Terminal 3===
Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 will be redesigned so that passengers feel &quot;immersed in Bulgarian culture&quot;. This is the development plan of the SOF Connect consortium, which won the concession at Sofia Airport. The new Terminal 3 will be built by 2030. This will be the main focus for this period and will be implemented along with the usage of Terminal 1 for VIP and business aviation services only.

===Other facilities===
The VIP terminal is located in the western wing of Terminal 1 and has an entrance of its own, providing an access to four separate rooms – one main room and two separated rooms with about 20 seats each.

The Government terminal is located in the western side of Sofia Airport. The terminal is operated by the 28th Air Detachment which operates government aircraft and operations involving the President, Prime Minister and other high-ranking government officials.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
In 1937, Sofia was used on a route from Berlin to Athens, and by 1938, regular direct flights linked Sofia to Belgrade. Just before the end of the one-party socialist state at the end of the 1980s BALKAN (Bulgarian Airlines) were operating both domestic, and mainly European international routes, to numerous destinations, carrying 2.8m passengers. The airport is used for scheduled, charter and seasonal operations on many European routes and on several further afield.
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Sofia:

A free shuttle bus service between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 runs from 05:00 until 23:00, connecting arriving and departing passengers from Terminal 1 to metro services.

Sofia Metro also provides a fast connection between the airport and Business Park Sofia, through interchange at Mladost 1 Metro Station to the M1 line.

===Bus===
Two bus routes serve the airport. Bus line 84 and bus line 184 connect both terminals to the city centre. Bus line 84 starts its route from Terminal 2 of Sofia Airport, passing through Terminal 1 of Sofia Airport on its way to the city centre. The route of bus line 184, on the other hand, starts from Terminal 1 of Sofia Airport, passing through Terminal 2 of Sofia Airport on its way to the city centre.

===Car===
Brussels Boulevard is the main thoroughfare to Sofia Airport. There is a new, faster road connection built from Terminal 2 to Brussels Boulevard.

Via Brussels Boulevard and Tsarigradsko shose, Sofia Airport is connected to both the city centre and eastbound destinations via Trakia motorway (A1) 

From the northern parts of Sofia, Sofia Airport is conveniently accessible via the East Tangent route. Its junction with Botevgradsko Shose provides access to northbound destinations via Hemus motorway (A2) 

Connecting to the southern parts of Sofia and Southwestern Bulgaria is the route via Brussels Boulevard and Boulevard Aleksandar Malinov to Sofia ring road which has an interchange with southbound Struma motorway (A3) 

===Train===
A railway station at Iskarsko shose was inaugurated in April 2015, providing faster interchange from the airport to southbound services on the Bulgarian national railway system. Situated about from Terminal 2, the train station is accessible via a short trip to Iskarsko shose Metro Station which is two stops away from Sofia Airport Metro Station on the M4 line.

===Taxi===
As of May 2023, Yellow! taxi company has been officially selected as the official and licensed operator for a period of five years, with a possibility of further extension with 3 more, following a tender with other larger taxi companies. Starting 1 January 2025, a minimum of 5% of the monthly taxi journeys operated from the airport should be conducted using electric vehicles and a year later the percentage should be increased to 10%.

<doc id="963401" wikidata="Q1613779" url="?curid=963401" title="Herodotus (crater)">
<text>Herodotus is a lunar impact crater located on a low shelf in the midst of the Oceanus Procellarum. To the east is the slightly larger crater Aristarchus. West across the mare is Schiaparelli. Almost due south on the mare surface is a solitary lunar dome designated Herodotus Omega (ω).

The crater Herodotus has a slightly irregular, narrow rim that appears somewhat oblong due to foreshortening. The inner floor has been flooded with lava, and has a lower albedo than its brighter and more prominent neighbor Aristarchus. There is a small craterlet overlapping the northwest rim, but otherwise the outer wall has not suffered significant wear. Nevertheless, the rim is unusually thin in relation to its size.

To the north of Herodotus is the start of the Vallis Schröteri, a valley that has a length of 160 kilometers and a maximum depth of nearly a kilometer. It begins at a small crater 25 km north of the rim, then winds across the surface to the north, before turning northwest and finally to the southwest before coming to a precipitous end at the edge of the raised shelf on which Herodotus is located. The valley is wider at its crater head than elsewhere, which has given it the nickname of the &quot;Cobra Head&quot;.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Herodotus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Herodotus D — &quot;See&quot; Raman.

<text>Messier 49 (also known as M49 or NGC 4472) is a giant elliptical galaxy about away in the equatorial constellation of Virgo. This galaxy was discovered by astronomer Charles Messier in 1777.

As an elliptical galaxy, Messier 49 has the physical form of a radio galaxy, but it only has the radio emission of a normal galaxy. From the detected radio emission, the core region has roughly 1053 erg (1046 J or 1022 YJ) of synchrotron energy. The nucleus of this galaxy is emitting X-rays, suggesting the likely presence of a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of , or 565 million times the mass of the Sun (). X-ray emissions shows a structure to the north of Messier 49 that resembles a bow shock. To the southwest of the core, the luminous outline of the galaxy can be traced out to a distance of 260 kpc.

This galaxy has many globular clusters: estimated to be about 5,900. This is far more than the roughly 200 orbiting the Milky Way, but dwarfed by the 13,450 orbiting the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87. On average, the globular clusters of M49 are about 10 billion years old. Between 2000 and 2009, strong evidence for a stellar mass black hole was discovered in one. A second candidate was announced in 2011.

Messier 49 was the first member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies to be discovered. It is the most luminous member of that cluster and more luminous than any galaxy closer to the Earth. This galaxy forms part of the smaller Virgo B subcluster 4.5° away from the dynamic center of the Virgo Cluster, centered on Messier 87. Messier 49 is gravitationally interacting with the dwarf irregular galaxy UGC 7636. The dwarf shows a trail of debris spanning roughly 1 × 5 arcminutes, which corresponds to a physical dimension of .

One supernova has been observed in M49: SN 1969Q (type unknown, mag. 13) was discovered by Evans on 12 June 1969. [Note: some sources incorrectly report the discovery date as 1 June 1969.]

<text>Laura Houghtaling Ingalls (December 14, 1893 – January 10, 1967) was an American pilot who won the Harmon Trophy.

She was arrested in December 1941 and convicted of failing to register as a paid Nazi agent, and served 20 months in prison. The Nazis had encouraged her to speak at events of the America First Committee.

==Early life==
Ingalls was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 14, 1893, to Francis Abbott Ingalls I and Martha Houghtaling. Martha was the daughter of David Harrison Houghtaling of Kingston, New York, who was a descendant of Jan Willemsen Hoogteling, who arrived in New Amsterdam on May 9, 1661. Laura wrote of her mother: My mother, partly through ill health, was extremely emotional and without adequate self-discipline; spoiled by her parents who thought she was wonderful and could do anything. Brilliant along certain lines, she possessed the trait I find most exciting in the American character, viz. the ability to hurdle difficulties and achieve the reputedly impossible. I grew up under such influence.

She attended private schools in New York, and also studied in Vienna and Paris. She studied nursing at the Presbyterian Hospital Training School in New York. Quitting nursing, she danced in ballet and vaudeville.

==Personal life==
Laura Houghtaling Ingalls was a distant cousin of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;&#x27;s Laura Ingalls Wilder, and became a friend of her daughter Rose Wilder Lane.

==Aviation==
She learned aviation in 1928 at Roosevelt Field near Mineola, New York, and then continued at Parks Air College in St. Louis. By 1930 she was setting records in acrobatic flying.

Her best-known flights were made in 1934 and earned her a Harmon Trophy. Ingalls flew in a Lockheed Air Express from Mexico to Chile, over the Andes Mountains to Rio de Janeiro, to Cuba and then to Floyd Bennett Field in New York, marking the first flight over the Andes by an American woman, the first solo flight around South America in a landplane, the first flight by a woman from North America to South America, and setting a woman&#x27;s distance record of 17,000 miles.

==Activities as a Nazi agent==
In late September 1939, Ingalls flew over Washington, D.C., in her Lockheed Orion monoplane, dropping anti-intervention pamphlets. She was arrested for violating White House airspace, but was released within hours.
Following the defeat of France in 1940, she approached Baron (Freiherr) Ulrich von Gienanth, the head of the Gestapo in the US, and, officially, second secretary of the German Embassy. She suggested that she make a solo flight to Europe, where she would continue her campaign to promote the Nazi cause. Von Gienanth told her to stay in America to work with the America First Committee.

Ingalls gave speeches for the Committee in which she derided America&#x27;s &quot;lousy democracy&quot; and gave Nazi salutes. Von Gienanth praised her oratorical skills. She had made a careful study of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, on which she based many of her speeches, as well as pamphlets by Hitler such as &quot;My New Order&quot; and &quot;Germany and the Jewish Question&quot;, and Elizabeth Dilling&#x27;s books &quot;The Roosevelt Red Record&quot; and &quot;The Octopus&quot;. She expected Hitler to win the war; in April 1941, she wrote to a German official, &quot;Some day I will shout my triumph to a great leader and a great people... Heil Hitler!&quot; After the German declaration of war on December 11, 1941, she went straight to Washington to receive a list of contacts from von Gienanth, and was arrested a week later.

Ingalls was charged with failing to register with the government as a paid Nazi agent, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. She had been receiving approximately $300 a month from von Gienanth. During the trial it came out that von Gienanth had encouraged Ingalls&#x27;s participation in the America First Committee, a significant embarrassment for that organization.

The FBI testified that they had kept her under surveillance for several months. Ingalls was convicted, and sentenced to eight months to two years in prison on February 20, 1942. She was transferred from the District of Columbia jail to the U.S. federal women&#x27;s prison in Alderson, West Virginia, on July 14, 1943, after fighting with another inmate. She was released from prison on October 5, 1943, after serving 20 months.

Prison had not altered her views, however. A few months after her release, she stated her opinion of the Normandy landings: 

After her probation ended, in July 1944 Ingalls was arrested at the Mexican border. Her suitcase contained seditious materials, including notes she had made of Japanese and German short-wave radio broadcasts. She was prevented from entering Mexico, but was not prosecuted. Ingalls applied for a presidential pardon in 1950, but her application for clemency was rejected by two successive Pardon Attorneys. On the latter occasion, the reply stated that Ingalls had been of &quot;special value of the Nazi propaganda machine&quot;.

She died on January 10, 1967, in Burbank, California, aged 73.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Sollmann, later William Frederick Sollmann (1 April 1881 – 6 January 1951) was a German journalist, politician, and interior minister of the Weimar Republic. In 1919, he was on the staff of the German delegation that was to receive the Treaty of Versailles. In 1933, he emigrated and eventually moved to the United States where he became an advocate for the peaceful resolution of conflicts.

==Life==

===Early life in the German Empire===
Wilhelm Sollmann was born on 2 April 1881 in , Saxe-Meiningen (today a part of Sonneberg, Thuringia). His father was Johan Jakob Sollmann, a brewer and farmer in Oberlind and after 1889 tenant of the &quot;Ratskeller&quot; at Coburg. His mother was Christiane Sollmann, inn keeper. After the move to Coburg, Wilhelm attended the Casimirianum gymnasium from 1891 to 1897, when he had to leave due to the family&#x27;s financial difficulties. That year, his family moved to Cologne. There, he began work as an apprentice (&quot;kaufmännische Lehre&quot;). From 1901-11 he worked as a &quot;Handlungsgehilfe&quot; whilst attending night school at the &quot;Handelshochschule Köln&quot;. Originally rooted in Lutheran Christianity, he was a member of the &quot;Internationaler Guttempler-Orden&quot; and the CVJM. However, in 1902 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and in 1907 co-founded the Workers&#x27; Youth at Cologne. He was also active in the temperance movement and was chairman of the &quot;Arbeiter-Abstinenzbewegung&quot; (workers&#x27; temperance movement, 1906–10). He was also a member of the &quot;Angestelltengwerkschaft&quot; (white-collar workers&#x27; union). In 1906, Sollmann married Anna Katharina (Käthe, Kate) née Grümmer (born 1883, died before 1975). They had one daughter, Elfriede (1912–97). In 1908, Sollmann became a &quot;Freidenker&quot;.

In 1911, Sollmann became editor of the socialdemocratic newspaper &quot;Fränkischer Volksfreund&quot; at Würzburg, but soon returned to Cologne where he became editor (1912) and later editor-in-chief (1920–33) of the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot;. During World War I, Sollmann was the chairman of the social democratic union (&quot;Verein&quot;) of Cologne.

===German Revolution and Weimar Republic===
During the German Revolution of 1918 he played a key role in the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; council of Cologne. From 1918-24, Sollmann was a member of the Cologne municipal parliament (&quot;Stadtverordneter&quot;). In 1919, he was elected to the Weimar National Assembly and held his seat until the new elections to the Reichstag in 1920. Working closely with Konrad Adenauer, whom he later described as &quot;a personal friend and political enemy&quot;, Sollmann helped turn the &quot;Handelshochschule&quot; into the University of Cologne in 1919. He rejected an honorific doctorate in 1919 (and again in 1928) for personal reasons.

In 1919, Sollmann also was a staff member of the German delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in Versailles, where he served as an expert on problems of the Rheinland occupation. He was a member of the Reichstag from 1920 until 1933. In 1921, he initiated the establishment of the &quot;Sozialdemokratischer Parlamentsdienst&quot; (after 1924: &quot;Sozialdemokratischer Pressedienst&quot;), a political news service. From 13 August 1923 until his resignation on 3 November, he served as &quot;Reichsminister des Innern&quot; (Reich Minister of the Interior) in the cabinets of Gustav Stresemann.

In parliament, he served as a member of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, and as an expert on disarmament and adult education.

===Germany 1933 and emigration===
In 1933, he was elected to the executive board of the SPD and as such persecuted by the Nazis after the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;. On 9 March, he was taken into &quot;Schutzhaft&quot; (&quot;protective custody&quot;) and tortured. After being released, he fled in May via Luxembourg to the occupied Saar. There he briefly worked as the editor-in-chief of the socialdemocratic &quot;Volskstimme&quot;. After the referendum he returned to Luxembourg, in 1936 went on to the United Kingdom and in 1937 emigrated to the United States.

===In America===
In the U.S., Sollmann worked as a writer, speaker, radio announcer and faculty member (1937–1950) of the Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation, a Quaker study center located in Wallingford, Pennsylvania.

In the next years, Sollmann travelled through most of the United States, giving lectures on world affairs. He became a visiting professor of international affairs at Haverford, Bard, and Reed Colleges.

Having lost his German citizenship in 1936, in 1943 he was naturalized and changed his name to William Frederick Sollmann. That year, he also became a Quaker.

A member of the SPD&#x27;s right wing, in exile he was one of the leading proponents of the &quot;volkssozialistische Richtung&quot; within the party. At the request of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization, Sollmann briefly visited occupied Germany in 1948, where he held speeches and radio addresses. On another visit the following year he served as visiting professor at the University of Cologne. In 1949/50, the U.S. government consulted him on setting up a new German Civil Liberties Union (&quot;Bund für Bürgerrechte&quot;) and he worked for the Allied High Commission, but he had to return to the United States due to the onset of illness. During his visits, he met with politicians like Adenauer and Kurt Schumacher and also was Adenauer&#x27;s guest of honour at the inaugural meeting of the &quot;Deutscher Bundestag&quot;. Sollmann was co-founder of the Carl Schurz-Gesellschaft, member of the &quot;Verbands deutscher Journalisten im Ausland&quot; and of the Legion for American Unity.

On 6 January 1951, Sollmann died in Mount Carmel, Connecticut.

A street in Cologne is named after him.

<text>Swordfish is a 2001 American action thriller film directed by Dominic Sena, written by Skip Woods, produced by Joel Silver, and starring John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Vinnie Jones, and Sam Shepard. The film centers on Stanley Jobson, an ex-con and computer hacker who is targeted for recruitment into a bank robbery conspiracy because of his formidable hacking skills.

== Plot ==
Cyber-hacker Stanley Jobson becomes notorious for infecting the FBI&#x27;s Carnivore program with a computer virus. Stanley&#x27;s parole forbids him from accessing the internet and computers while his ex-wife Melissa, an alcoholic and part-time porn star, issued a restraining order against him. This also prevents him from seeing his daughter, Holly.

Ginger Knowles persuades Stanley to work for Gabriel Shear, who forces him into cracking a secure Defense Department server. After the hack, Gabriel offers Stanley $10 million to program a multi-headed worm, a &quot;hydra&quot;, to siphon $9.5 billion from the government slush funds. Stanley begins work on the worm, learning that Gabriel leads Black Cell, a secret organization created by J. Edgar Hoover to attack terrorists that threaten the United States. He also privately discovers Ginger is a DEA agent working undercover and is further surprised to discover a corpse that resembles Gabriel.

After taking Holly home from school, Stanley discovers he is being followed by FBI agent J.T. Roberts, who had previously arrested him. Roberts, though monitoring Stanley, is more interested in Gabriel as he does not appear on any government database, and after learning that another hacker, Axl Torvalds, was killed by Gabriel&#x27;s men, warns Stanley to be cautious. Stanley opts to secretly code a backdoor in his hydra that reverses the money transfer after a short period. Meanwhile, Senator Jim Reisman, who oversees Black Cell, learns the FBI started tracking Gabriel and orders him to stand down. Gabriel refuses and defeats a hit team dispatched against him by Reisman. In retaliation, Gabriel kills Reisman and continues his plan.

Stanley delivers the hydra to Gabriel and leaves to see Holly, only to find that Gabriel kidnapped her and framed him for Melissa&#x27;s murder alongside her husband and porn producer. Stanley is forced to participate in a bank heist to get Holly back. At the site of the heist, Gabriel and his men storm a branch and secure its employees and customers as hostages, fitting each of them with ball-bearing-based explosives similar to Claymore mines. When police and FBI surround the branch, Gabriel takes Stanley to a nearby coffee shop across the street to meet with Roberts, but Gabriel spends the time discussing the film &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; and the nature of misdirection. Once back in the bank, Gabriel has one of his men escort a hostage to demonstrate the situation where a sharpshooter kills the man. As other agents pull the hostage away from the bank, the bomb detonates and devastates much of the street.

Gabriel instructs Stanley to launch the hydra and turns Holly over to him once completed. However, the back door triggers before they can leave the bank, leading to Stanley being recaptured while Holly is rescued. Gabriel threatens to kill Ginger, whom he knows is a DEA agent unless Stanley re-siphons the money back to a Monte Carlo bank. Although Stanley complies, Gabriel shoots Ginger. Gabriel and his men load the hostages onto a bus and demand a plane wait for them at the local airport, but while en route, the bus is lifted off by a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane and carried across the city. The bus is then deposited on the roof of a skyscraper, where Gabriel deactivates the bombs and attempts to escape with his surviving men on a waiting helicopter. Stanley shoots down the helicopter using a grenade launcher that Gabriel’s men had left on the bus.

Roberts takes Stanley to verify a corpse they found, believing Gabriel was a Mossad agent. There is no record of a DEA agent named Ginger Knowles, and her body was not found. Stanley recognizes the corpse as the one he discovered earlier and realizes that the whole scenario was a deception; Ginger was wearing a bulletproof vest and was working with Gabriel all along, who escaped via a different route. Despite Stanley not telling the police that Gabriel and Ginger are still alive, Roberts arranges for Stanley to have full custody of Holly, where they depart to places elsewhere. In Monte Carlo, Gabriel and Ginger withdraw the stolen money and later watch as a yacht at sea explodes. A news report later reveals the destruction of the yacht, carrying a known terrorist, as the third such incident in weeks.

==Cast==
== Reception ==
&quot;Swordfish&quot; received early press coverage because word leaked out that Halle Berry was doing her first topless scene, and paid an extra $500,000 on top of her $2 million fee. Critics said the scene looked forced, just to garner press. &quot;Halle Berry Nude&quot; jumped to the top of search engine results. Berry said she did the topless scene, knowing it was gratuitous, to overcome the fear of appearing nude onscreen.

As of 2024, 26% of the 139 reviews compiled on Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 4.35/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Swordfish&quot; is big on explosions, but critics dislike how it skimps on plot and logic. Also, the sight of a person typing at a computer just isn&#x27;t that interesting.&quot; In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden described the film as &quot;a meticulously choreographed bang-by-the-numbers action fantasy that I would accuse of peddling evil if the film weren&#x27;t so dumb and incoherent&quot;, concluding that:
The film grossed over $147 million in worldwide box office receipts on a production budget of $102 million. John Travolta&#x27;s performance in the film earned him a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actor (also for &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot;).

In a review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe described the film as being &quot;an action opera designed to elicit Beavis and Butt-head-level appreciation, rather than effete applause from the critics&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack was produced by Paul Oakenfold, under Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. and distributed through London Sire Records, Inc. It contains 15 tracks. The film&#x27;s orchestral score was written by Christopher Young with several electronic additions by Paul Oakenfold. Fragments from the score were added to the official soundtrack but were remixed by Oakenfold. A more complete release was issued as an award promo, which is known for its rarity.

== Rodney Cox myth ==
The Rodney Cox myth is an urban legend which purports that a man, whose name is sometimes given as Robert Cox, was personally executed by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson for treason. There is no substantive evidence that Cox existed or that Jefferson personally executed anybody, yet the urban legend has persisted. The rumor seems to originate from &quot;Swordfish&quot;, which presents the story.

<doc id="963444" wikidata="Q3077083" url="?curid=963444" title="Ford Courier">
<text>Ford Courier is a model nameplate used by Ford since the early 1950s. The Courier moniker has been used on a variety of vehicles all around the world since it was first used in North America for a sedan delivery. The Courier nameplate was also used by Ford for a series of compact pickup trucks (produced by Mazda) and would also see use by Ford of Europe denoting a Fiesta-based panel van. Ford Brazil used the nameplate for a Fiesta-based coupe utility pickup marketed across Latin America.

During the 2000s, the Courier pickup truck was replaced by the Ranger nameplate (which replaced the Courier in North America for 1983); the Courier panel van was replaced by the Ford Transit Connect in 2002. For 2014, the stand-alone Courier name was withdrawn, but returned as the Transit Courier, the smallest vehicle of the Ford Transit van series.


== Sedan delivery (1952–1960) ==
From 1952 to 1960, the Ford Courier nameplate was used for the sedan delivery bodystyle of the full-size Ford line. Sharing its body with the two-door Ford station wagon, the Courier was intended for use primarily as a commercial vehicle, replacing the rear seating area with storage; the side windows were replaced with painted steel panels. Ford also marketed a similar vehicle derived from the F-Series pickup truck named the panel delivery; both of these served as precursors of the modern-day cargo van. 

Marketed exclusively as a two-door vehicle, the Courier was initially designed with a side-hinged rear cargo access door (unique to the model line). For 1957 and 1958, the Courier adopted the two-piece &quot;clamshell&quot; rear door of the Ford Parklane and Ford Del Rio station wagons. 

For 1959 and 1960, to lower production costs of the model line, the Courier adopted the body of the two-door Ford Ranch Wagon in its entirety, distinguished only by its rear cargo area. 

For the 1961 model year, Ford discontinued the Courier sedan delivery and F-Series panel delivery, replacing both model lines with the Ford Econoline cargo van. The two-door sedan delivery bodystyle was made part of the compact Ford Falcon range, offered through the 1964 model year.

== Mazda-based models ==
For 1972 production, Ford revived the Courier nameplate after a 12-year hiatus, applying it to its first compact pickup truck, a rebranded version of the Mazda B-Series. Sold worldwide, the model line was the first product marketed jointly between the two manufacturers, launching an alliance that would last through 2020 production.

=== First generation (1972–1976) ===

In the early 1970s, the Ford Courier name was applied to the Mazda B series, a compact pickup manufactured by Mazda. It had greater fuel economy than the full-sized pickups of the time. The Courier was manufactured by Toyo Kogyo (Mazda) and imported to North America and sold by Ford Motor Company as a response to the unforeseen popularity of the small Toyota and Nissan/Datsun Pickups. It occupied the market segment previously held by the Ford Falcon-based Ranchero when that platform was upgraded to the larger Ford Fairlane in 1966.

Like the other minipickups of the time, it featured a small (by US standards) four-cylinder engine, a four-speed manual transmission, rear-wheel drive, an impressive load capability of 1,400 lb (635 kg) considering its size, and a fairly small price tag compared to full-sized pickups of the time. To circumvent the 25% &quot;chicken tax&quot; on light trucks, Couriers (as with Chevrolet LUVs) were imported in &quot;cab chassis&quot; configurations, which included the entire light truck—less the cargo box or truck bed—and were only subject to a 4% tariff. Subsequently, a truck bed was attached to the chassis and the vehicle could be sold as a light truck.

The body styling was effectively that of the related Mazda B-series; however, its front styling was unique in that the grille was designed to emulate the larger Ford F-series, and large single headlights instead of the B-series&#x27; smaller twin units.

When the Courier was introduced, it came standard with a 1.8-liter overhead-cam engine, which produced at 5,070 rpm, and 92 lb-ft (125 Nm) at 3,500 rpm. A four-speed manual transmission was standard, and a three-speed automatic was optional. A five-speed manual option was introduced for the 1976 model year. Northwest A.T.V. in Kelso, Washington converted around 1500 examples to the 4WD &quot;Courier Sasquatch&quot;. The Sasquatch was fitted with a Dana Spicer two-speed transfer case and a solid front axle; they were only sold along the west coast of the United States.

The Courier&#x27;s badging changed a few times in the first generation. In 1972 and 1973, the tailgate read &quot;COURIER&quot; in large raised letters, with a small &quot;FORD&quot; badge on the upper left. The 1972 model has a small &quot;COURIER&quot; badge on the front driver&#x27;s side edge of the hood, and from 1973 through 1976, the hood badging read &quot;FORD&quot;. From the 1974 model year, the tailgate read &quot;FORD&quot; in large letters, with a small &quot;COURIER&quot; badge on the lower right. In 1976, the cab was lengthened by 3 in (76 mm), and the grille received added trim.
=== Second generation (1977–1985) ===
Beginning in 1977, Ford gave the Courier a fresh look, moving into the more blocky, angular styling that is distinct of 1980s automotive design. The base model engine remained the VB engine.

The truck was available with front disc brakes, and a Ford-built 2.3-liter engine option (which was the same as that of the Ford Pinto &amp; Mustang II and Mercury Bobcat &amp; Capri). The key identifying feature of the Courier from the Mazda B-Series was still the singular headlights, although with park and indicator lights placed in the grille starting in &#x27;78 (&#x27;77s still had the turn signal lights in the bumper). In 1979, the base model was increased in size to 2.0 liter (120.1 CID). The optional Ford 2.3-liter (140 cid) engine was produced in Brazil. The Courier was never available with a diesel engine in the US. However, the 1980 Mazda B2200 was available with the S2, a Mazda license built Perkins 4.135 (four-cylinder, 135-cid) 2.2-liter diesel engine, producing at 2,100 rpm. This same diesel engine was available in the 1983 and 1984 Ford Rangers, but it was replaced by the Mitsubishi 4D55T 2.3-liter turbodiesel (also used in Mitsubishi&#x27;s own Mighty Max and the Dodge Ram 50) for the 1985 to 1987 Ford Rangers.

The Courier continued to be sold in North America until 1982 model year. For 1983, Ford introduced its own Ford Ranger to fill its compact truck segment in the United States and Canada, effectively replacing the Courier. However, in other markets (such as Australia), this generation of Couriers continued on until the 1985 model year, when the next generation was introduced. Australian models received a facelift around 1982/1983.

Between 1979 and 1982, a number of electric Ford Couriers were produced. Jet Industries purchased &quot;vehicle gliders&quot; (Ford Courier bodies minus their engines) and put in a series DC motor and lead-acid batteries to produce the Jet Industries ElectraVan 750. These were sold mainly for use as service trucks, generally to local government departments. They had a top speed of about 70 mph (113 km/h), and would go 50 to 60 miles (97 km) on a full charge. A number of these vehicles still exist, usually with upgraded motor control systems and higher-voltage battery packs.
=== Third generation (1985–1998) ===

Coinciding with the 1985 redesign of the Mazda Proceed/B-Series, the Courier was given a larger, more modern cab. New options included five-speed manual transmissions, four-wheel drive, and a V6 engine. For the first time, extended and four-door cabs were available.

In a similar fashion to the North American Ford Ranger becoming the donor platform for the Ford Explorer SUV, a sport utility would be based upon this version of the Courier. Branded the Ford Raider (and equivalent Mazda Proceed Marvie), it was sold from 1991 to 1997.

=== Fourth generation (1998–2007) ===

In 1998, Mazda released a complete redesign of the B-Series, with Ford adopting the Ranger nameplate for both Mazda-produced and Ford-produced compact trucks. This Ranger was sold worldwide, with the exception of North America (and certain Latin American markets).

Ford Australia continued the use of the Ford Courier nameplate, selling it through 2006 in Australia and New Zealand.

== Fiesta-based models ==

=== Europe (1991–2002) ===

A Ford Courier B-segment car-derived van was launched in Europe in June 1991 with a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout and 1.3-litre OHV petrol or 1.8-litre OHC Diesel power. Based on the Ford BE-2 platform also used by the Mark III and Mark IV Fiesta, Mark I Ka and Puma (sport compact) cars, the Ford Courier van was initially based on the Mark III Fiesta that had been introduced two years earlier in 1989, but with a longer wheelbase and Renault-derived torsion bar rear suspension.

From August 1995, the Courier van was instead produced in a Mark IV-based version and did receive that Fiesta&#x27;s facelift in 1999, meaning that it was produced with three different front ends, all with similar rear ends using the 1986–2000 Transit rear lights. As well as the two-seat cargo version, there was also a glazed version produced with rear seats fitted; this five-seat passenger model was sold as the Courier Kombi.

The Courier van was built in the Dagenham, England and Cologne, Germany factories and is 4,115 mm long, 1,650 mm wide and 1,835 mm tall, with a curb weight of 1,700 kg. With a capacity of 590 kg, competing products were initially the Fiat Fiorino and the Renault Express, and all units received a five-speed manual gearbox.

In France, the Ford Courier was called Ford Courrier (with two &quot;r&quot;s), likely because &quot;Courier&quot; looked like the French word &quot;Courrier&quot; (mail) was misspelled.

The 60 PS (44 kW) 1.8-litre naturally aspirated Diesel engine achieves its maximum power at 4,800 rpm, and its maximum torque is 110 Nm at 2,500 rpm. The claimed top speed of the Courier van 1.8D is 84 mph (135 km/h), with acceleration not specified.

From 1999 to 2002, a 1.8-litre turbo-diesel engine was available as an option for improved performance. However, the 1.8TD was only offered in 75 PS low-boost guise; the 90 PS intercooled version (as offered on the Mark VI Escort van) was not made available on the Courier van.

Production of the Courier van ended in August 2002, and both it and the Escort van were replaced in September 2002 by the Ford Transit Connect, based on the Focus. However, after 11 years of no direct replacement, a van based on the Fiesta bearing the Transit Courier/Tourneo Courier name was revealed in Yeniköy, Turkey, in 2013 under Ford Otosan (Koc-Ford Motor Company Joint Venture).

=== Brazil (1998–2013) ===
The name was also applied to a small coupe utility of similar layout produced by Ford in Brazil and exported to countries such as Mexico. It is based on the 1998 model of the Ford Fiesta. While its front treatment is the same as the South African-built Fiesta-based Ford Bantam &quot;bakkie&quot; coupe utility, it has a completely different load box. The South African version had the short doors of the five-door hatchback and small quarter lights in the style of larger extended cab pickups, and the Brazilian version had the three-door&#x27;s longer doors and no quarter windows.

Its load capacity is . Until 1999, the Courier used the Endura 1.3-liter engine and the Zetec-SE 1.4-l 16v engine. The Mk IV 1.4 16v Zetec-SE has a top speed of and can accelerate from in 12 seconds. Since 2000, both engines were replaced by the Zetec Rocam 1.6-liter. The Mk V 1.6 model has top speed of and can accelerate from 0–100 km/h in 10 seconds.

Its dimensions are wheelbase, length, width and height.

Ford announced in January 2002 that it is going to transfer the entire production of the Courier pickup to the factory in São Bernardo do Campo, in the ABC region of São Paulo, starting in May 2002. Production of the pickup truck is currently divided between the São Bernardo do Campo plant in the state of São Paulo and the Camaçari plant in Bahia state. The transfer agreement was signed on January 22, 2002 with workers representatives. 

From 2013, the plant in São Bernardo do Campo in Brazil has suspended the manufacturing model for ordinary consumers and business, but Ford has not confirmed that the model was taken from line definitely. Despite Ford not confirming that the Courier was taken from line definitely, the Courier had seemed to end production and was possibly replaced by the Ford Ranger (T6). In Mexico, it stopped being sold after 2010.

<text>Hipparchus is the degraded remnant of a lunar impact crater. It was named after the Greek astronomer, geographer and mathematician Hipparchus. It is located to the southeast of Sinus Medii, near the center of the visible Moon. To the south is the prominent crater Albategnius, and to the southwest lies Ptolemaeus, a feature of comparable dimensions to Hipparchus. Horrocks lies entirely within the northeast rim of the crater. Halley is attached to the south rim, and Hind lies to the southeast. To the north-northeast is the bowl-shaped Pickering, and the flooded Saunder is located off the northeast rim. High-resolution images of Hipparchus were obtained by Lunar Orbiter 5 in 1967.

==Description==
This feature is an ancient crater that has been subject to considerable modification due to subsequent impacts. The western rim of Hipparchus has been all but worn away from impact erosion, and only low hills and rises in the surface remain to outline the feature. The wall to the east is somewhat more intact, but it too is heavily worn. A pair of deep clefts lie in the western wall. These parallel a sets of scars running through the south-central highlands. The crater floor has been partially resurfaced by basaltic lava flow. The southwest part of the floor, however, is slightly raised and much more rugged than the remainder. A few small rises and the raised partial rim of a flooded crater are all that remain of a central massif. Gaps in the northwest rim of Hipparchus form valleys that connect with the mare to the northwest. A rille named Rima Réaumur runs from this site to the outer wall of Réaumur.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hipparchus.

==Hooke&#x27;s Observations==
In October 1664, Robert Hooke used a 36-foot telescope to make a detailed drawing of the single crater Hipparchus and surrounding terrain, which he published as a plate in his &quot;Micrographia&quot; (1665). His drawing contained an abundance of detail, and can be considered the first high-definition illustration of an individual lunar feature. Hooke argued that its features were not fixed, but were a product of ongoing physical forces. He suggested two possible models to explain lunar crater formation: projectile bombardment from space and subterranean lunar vulcanism. Less accurately, he speculated that the crater might contain 
&quot;verdant pastures&quot; and &quot;Vegetables analogous to our Grass, Shrubs, and Trees”.

==Hipparchus in fiction==
In the original version of the 1954 Tintin book &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; (&quot;On a marché sur la lune&quot;), the crew lands on Hipparchus.

<doc id="963458" wikidata="Q1754107" url="?curid=963458" title="Ted Leo and the Pharmacists">
<text>Ted Leo and the Pharmacists (sometimes written Ted Leo/Pharmacists, Ted Leo + Pharmacists, or shortened to TL/Rx) are an American rock band formed in 1999 in Washington, D.C. They have released six full-length studio albums and have toured internationally. Though the group&#x27;s lineup has fluctuated throughout their career, singer/guitarist Ted Leo has remained the band&#x27;s main songwriter, creative force, and only constant member. The group&#x27;s music combines elements of punk rock, indie rock, art punk, traditional rock, and occasionally folk music and dub reggae. Their most recent album, &quot;The Brutalist Bricks&quot;, was released on March 9, 2010.

== History ==
=== 1999–2001: Formation and first releases ===
Ted Leo&#x27;s previous band, Chisel, had broken up in 1997 after internal struggles with both a direction to go and Leo&#x27;s bounding depression. After the breakup, Ted spent time producing and working on albums for the Spinanes, the Secret Stars, and Jejune. He also fronted the Sin Eaters, a short-lived band featuring members of the Van Pelt and Native Nod. After these projects either finished or fizzled out, Leo started playing solo. In 1999, he recorded and released &quot;tej leo(?), Rx / pharmacists&quot;, a solo effort which was highly experimental and mixed elements of punk rock, reggae, dub, and audio experimentation. 

In 2000, Leo expanded the project to a full band including James Canty on guitar, Jodi Buonanno on bass and Amy Farina on drums. He named the backing band the Pharmacists, and the group released the EP &quot;Treble in Trouble&quot;. The EP moved away from many of the experimental elements of &quot;tej leo&quot; by relying on more traditional rock structures and instrumentation, though it still explored some non-traditional characteristics.

=== 2001–2005: Lookout! Records, &quot;Hearts of Oak&quot;, and &quot;Shake the Sheets&quot; ===
The band signed to Lookout! Records in 2001 and experienced more lineup changes as Buonanno and Farina left the group. For the album &quot;The Tyranny of Distance&quot;, Leo and Canty utilized a number of in-studio backing musicians. The album incorporated multiple styles including Celtic rock, acoustic folk balladry and pop rock. During the supporting tours for the album, bassist Dave Lerner, drummer Chris Wilson, and keyboardist Dorien Garry became permanent members. The group&#x27;s next album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Hearts of Oak&quot;, drew from punk rock and new wave influences. The EP &quot;Tell Balgeary, Balgury Is Dead&quot; soon followed and featured a number of Leo&#x27;s solo songs and covers. A video documentary of the band performing at the 2003 Siren Music Festival in Coney Island, &quot;Dirty Old Town,&quot; was released in early 2004 by Plexifilm. 

Prior to the recording of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Shake the Sheets&quot;, Garry and Canty left the band, reducing the group to a trio. The album explored social and political topics and experienced some success with the single &quot;Me and Mia&quot;. The iTunes-exclusive EP &quot;Sharkbite Sessions&quot; followed in 2005.

=== 2006-present: Touch and Go Records, &quot;Living with the Living&quot;, and &quot;The Brutalist Bricks&quot; ===

In 2006, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists left Lookout! amidst financial crises within the label, and signed a new contract with Chicago-based Touch and Go Records. The band&#x27;s popularity continued to expand through constant touring and performances at large festivals such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Pitchfork Music Festival. Their fourth full-band album, &quot;Living with the Living&quot;, was released on March 20, 2007. First-run copies of the album also included the &quot;Mo&#x27; Living&quot; EP. Canty rejoined them for touring in support of &quot;Living with the Living&quot;.

Bassist Lerner played his last show with the band at McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn, NY on August 12, 2007. Marty &quot;Violence&quot; Key, formerly of the (Young) Pioneers, replaced him on tour. In April 2008, the band recorded a performance for the &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; concert series in Toronto. They then performed as openers for six dates of Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2008 U.S. tour in June.

They toured with Against Me! and Future of the Left in September and October 2008.

On September 15, 2008, the band released a surprise digital EP, &quot;Rapid Response&quot;, in response to the violence at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. The EP was made available on the Touch and Go website for a choice of prices with all proceeds going to &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and Food Not Bombs of St. Paul.

The Pharmacists&#x27; most recent album, &quot;The Brutalist Bricks&quot;, was released on March 9, 2010, followed by a tour of the United States and Europe. In September 2011, Key left the band to open a record store. The band continued as a trio with Canty taking over on bass.

In a 2012 interview, Leo alluded to a new album to be released that summer, which has yet to be issued. In 2017, Leo released &quot;The Hanged Man&quot; under his own name after funding it through a Kickstarter campaign.

On March 4, 2022, Leo released an EP titled &quot;Andy, Come Out&quot; on his Bandcamp, featuring two new songs and a cover of the song &quot;Ping Pong&quot; by Stereolab that Leo had played live the night before. This was followed up by &quot;The Old 200 EP&quot; a month later. He sporadically put out more EPs throughout the rest of the year, all credited under the Pharmacists name. 

On February 13, 2024, Leo announced the Pharmacists would be going on a US tour in celebration of the 20th anniversary of &quot;Shake The Sheets&quot; with opening support from Ekko Astral and Diners.

<text>Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights is the third studio album by Finnish gothic rock band HIM, released 27 August 2001. The album was produced by Kevin Shirley, T. T. Oksala and HIM. The record had a troubled production, which lasted approximately eleven months. The prolonged recording process was partially due outside influences within the music industry hoping to repeat the success of HIM&#x27;s previous album. As a result, &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; features a sleeker and more pop-oriented sound. It is the first HIM album to feature keyboardist Janne &quot;Burton&quot; Puurtinen.

&quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. While some gave praise to the songwriting and Ville Valo&#x27;s vocal performance, most were highly critical of the production and overall commercial sound. Despite this, &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; charted in seven countries, peaking at number one in Finland and Austria. It would later go platinum and gold, respectively. &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Three singles were released, all of which reached the top two spots on the Finnish Singles Chart. The supporting tour for &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; saw HIM playing in the US for the first time, but overall strained the band to the point of nearly breaking up.

==Production==
HIM began demoing songs for its third album in the northern fall of 2000 at Petrax Studios in Hollola, with producer T. T. Oksala. Satisfied with the initial recordings, the band hoped to use them on the album, with additional overdubs being done at a later date. However, BMG, HIM&#x27;s record label, disagreed, with Valo believing they wanted a more well-known producer working on the album instead of Oksala. BMG&#x27;s Asko Kallonen refuted these claims, stating that he and the label were worried by the band&#x27;s plan to release &quot;essentially demos&quot; so soon after an exhausting touring cycle for &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;. Under pressure from BMG&#x27;s international branches to repeat the success of &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;, HIM was paired with producer Kevin Shirley, who had previously worked with Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, and The Black Crowes, among others. While Shirley was excited to be working with the band, they were not entirely on board with his style of producing, in addition to the amount of money BMG had spent hiring him. However, Valo later admitted that some of Shirley&#x27;s ideas did improve the songs.
The recording process for HIM&#x27;s third album lasted approximately eleven months. This had a profound effect on the songs, with Valo later noting: &quot;When we started recording the third album, we were into stoner rock and Black Sabbath [...] At the end we were into Neil Young and it shows on the record.&quot; In addition, several outside forces within the music industry contributed to the album&#x27;s troubled production. According to Valo: &quot;The industry wasn&#x27;t expecting [&quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;] to be such a hit that it was, so it meant that now there was like seventeen thousand different A&amp;R people from the record companies and whatnots in the studio, and everybody had an opinion.&quot; During the album&#x27;s recording process, keyboardist Janne &quot;Burton&quot; Puurtinen replaced Jussi-Mikko &quot;Juska&quot; Salminen, who played his final show with HIM on 31 December 2000.

After recording finished, the album was sent to Randy Staub and Chris Lord-Alge to mix. Additional mixing was done by John Fryer, who had produced the band&#x27;s previous album. The record was then mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York. The title &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; is a photography term, which Valo chose because of its yin and yang symbolism, that had been prominent in the band&#x27;s previous album titles as well. The original proposed album cover was rejected by BMG&#x27;s UK branch. Thus, Valo was flown out to London for a photoshoot with Rankin. The resulting album cover for &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; took inspiration from Lou Reed, Patti Smith, and late 1970s New York City art circles.

==Music and lyrics==

The overall sound of &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; has been described by music critics as more commercial and &quot;poppy&quot; than HIM&#x27;s previous albums. &quot;Salt in Our Wounds&quot; was deliberately chosen as the first track on the album to mess with the listeners&#x27; expectations, due to its use of looping and other effects. Despite the track&#x27;s experimental nature, Valo referred to it as &quot;the record&#x27;s Neil Young song&quot;. &quot;Heartache Every Moment&quot; features many of HIM&#x27;s signature sonic elements, including &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; gothic lyrics, piano, rough guitars and a &quot;howling melody&quot;. Valo also noted a distinct Bon Jovi influence in the song. &quot;Lose You Tonight&quot; changed the most throughout the recording process. It began in the style of Cathedral, before ending up like &quot;Bon Jovi on mushrooms&quot; as Valo described it. &quot;In Joy and Sorrow&quot; features guest performances by Apocalyptica&#x27;s Eino &quot;Eicca&quot; Toppinen and composer Tuomas Kantelinen. Valo compared the song to &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses, singling out the lyrics&#x27; &quot;no frills, self-ironic directness&quot; as one of the song&#x27;s best qualities.

&quot;Pretending&quot; was chosen by BMG to be the first single from the album. While Valo has admitted to being indifferent towards the song, he still singled out its relaxed nature and lyrics as particular highlights. Valo described &quot;Close to the Flame&quot; as &quot;sincere and direct&quot;, very similar in tone to &quot;Gone with the Sin&quot; from the band&#x27;s previous album. &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Let It Go&quot; began in the style of The Stooges, but after Valo recorded an acoustic version, the band chose to combine the two arrangements. &quot;Beautiful&quot; also began life as a more uptempo song, but the band felt the arrangement didn&#x27;t fit, so it was reworked in the style of John Frusciante&#x27;s first solo album. &quot;Don&#x27;t Close Your Heart&quot; was described by Valo as &quot;Jefferson Airplane meets Bon Jovi&quot;. Lyrically it tackles with similar themes as &quot;Join Me in Death&quot;, but from a different perspective. According to Valo, the song talks about how &quot;if things go to shit, you don&#x27;t have to sink into the swamp. You can ask for help and not close your heart&quot;. &quot;Love You Like I Do&quot; was described as &quot;Elvis on acid&quot; and makes use of church bells, which was done in tribute to Black Sabbath.

==Release and promotion==

The album was originally slated for released in May 2001, but was pushed back to August to accommodate a supporting tour. &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; was released on 27 August 2001, and it charted in six countries, peaking at number one in Finland and Austria, as well as number two in Germany and Switzerland. The album would later be certified platinum in Finland and gold in Austria. &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; also charted in the United States in 2004 at number 190, making it the band&#x27;s first album to hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Pretending&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, and it peaked at number one in Finland and number ten in Germany. The band initially wanted Miikka Lommi to helm the music video, but BMG and its UK marketing department refused, wanting Kevin Godley instead. &quot;In Joy and Sorrow&quot; was released as the second single, hitting number two in Finland. The accompanying music video was later described by Valo as the group&#x27;s &quot;shittiest&quot; video. &quot;Heartache Every Moment&quot; and &quot;Close to the Flame&quot; were released as a double single, with the former peaking at number two in Finland. Both tracks also received music videos.

In August 2001, HIM were invited to play their first show in the US at a party organized by professional skateboarder Bam Margera, whom the band had met while on tour for &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;. The official supporting tour for &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; began on 17 September 2001 in Hamburg, with Timo Rautiainen &amp; Trio Niskalaukaus and The Mission serving as opening acts for the German leg. The European tour for &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; lasted four months and 44 shows, which nearly resulted in the band breaking up. Valo later explained: &quot;The stress was at a level where I [was pissed off] the entire run – I had done this for three years straight without a vacation. No wonder the dams broke at some point.&quot; As a result, HIM took a two-month hiatus in early 2002. Guitarist Mikko &quot;Linde&quot; Lindström and bassist Mikko &quot;Mige&quot; Paananen headed to Nepal, drummer Mika &quot;Gas Lipstick&quot; Karppinen flew to New York, keyboardist Janne &quot;Burton&quot; Puurtinen vacationed in Turkey, while Ville Valo stayed in Helsinki. HIM regrouped at the turn of February and March 2002, when &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; was officially released in the UK. In support, the band played two shows in Birmingham and London, respectively, with the first being sold-out and the second supporting The Mission. HIM was also named Export of the Year at the Emma Awards. The band also received the Viewers&#x27; Choice Award at the VIVA Comet Awards. In March 2002, HIM began another Finnish tour, with The Skreppers serving as support. Afterwards, HIM returned to the UK for a full tour.

==Reception==

&quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Borivoj Krgin, writing for Blabbermouth.net, gave the album a score of nine out of ten. He described the record as &quot;the group&#x27;s most accessible offering so far&quot;, giving praise to the songwriting and Valo&#x27;s vocal delivery, which he called the &quot;most potently effective weapon in the group&#x27;s musical arsenal&quot;. While disappointed by the album&#x27;s softer sound, Krgin concluded his review by stating that &quot;in purely artistic and commercial terms – HIM have made the logical follow-up album to one of last year&#x27;s highlights, and they continue to cement their reputation as one of the most unique and consistent rock acts around.&quot; &quot;Rock Hard&quot;″s Thomas Kupfer, meanwhile, criticized the album&#x27;s production and mellower sound, but did give cudos to some of the songwriting. Ultimately though, he deemed &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; &quot;no more than a good pop album&quot;. This was echoed by Jani Mikkonen of &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, who described the album&#x27;s best moments as &quot;straight-up pop songs&quot;.

&quot;Rumba&quot;″s Janne Flinkkilä rated the record a six out of ten, stating: &quot;Every song has been squeezed into a tight hit format, where the song structures move as predictably as the seasons change.&quot; He also noted how Shirley and Oksala&#x27;s production brings &quot;Valo&#x27;s asthmatic breathing sounds to an almost comical scope&quot;. Ultimately, Flinkkilä stated that &quot;HIM hasn&#x27;t made a bad album&quot;, but &quot;compared to the gothic gloominess of past albums, &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; sounds very light&quot;. Antti J. Ravelin of AllMusic awarded the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, describing it as &quot;utterly boring&quot; and the songs as &quot;lacking hooks&quot;. In general, he described &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; as a &quot;horrible failure&quot; musically. Tero Alanko of &quot;Soundi&quot; felt similarly, deeming the record &quot;ideal music for girls, who don&#x27;t dig the music, but Ville Valo&#x27;s looks and his lyrics&#x27; decadent imagery&quot;. He also described the record as &quot;anemic&quot; and &quot;devoid of moments, where the best parts of the band come together to form something more that the sum of their parts.&quot;

In 2017, Valo revisited &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; and described it as a &quot;fragmented, unnatural record&quot;, stating: &quot;We were recovering from the cannon that was the last album and the way back to ground was through a lot of fumbling. There were too many chefs on the record than there should have been, so the end result was incoherent.&quot; &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked &quot;Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights&quot; sixth in HIM&#x27;s discography, describing it as not &quot;the follow-up to &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; that fans had hoped for&quot;, but still commending the &quot;hooks&quot; and Valo&#x27;s vocal performance. &quot;Kaaoszine&quot; ranked the record fifth in HIM&#x27;s discography, commending many of the song, while noting that the album is not &quot;as strong of an ensemble&quot; as some of the band&#x27;s other work.

<text>Messier 50 or M 50, also known as NGC 2323 or the Heart-shaped Cluster, is an open cluster of stars in the constellation Monoceros. It was recorded by G. D. Cassini before 1711 and independently discovered by Charles Messier in 1772 while observing Biela&#x27;s Comet. It is sometimes described as a &#x27;heart-shaped&#x27; figure or a blunt arrowhead.

M50 is about 2,900 light-years away from Earth and is near to but narrowly not estimated to be gravitationally tied to the Canis Major (CMa) OB1 association. It has a core radius of and spans . The cluster has 508 confirmed and 109 probable members – their combined mass is more than , the mean stellar density would thus be 1.3 stars per cubic parsec. It is around 140 million years old, with two high-mass white dwarfs and two chemically peculiar stars.

Traditionally considered to be a single star cluster, in 2025 it was found to consist of two separate sub-clusters (NGC 2323-a and NGC 2323-b), making it a binary cluster.

<text>The Ford EcoSport (pronounced ) is a subcompact crossover SUV (B-segment) manufactured by Ford between 2003 and 2022.

The first-generation model was developed and built in Brazil by Ford Brazil since 2003, at the Camaçari plant. The second-generation model was launched in 2012, which was assembled in factories in India, Thailand, Russia and Romania. The vehicle entered the North American market for the first time in 2018, until its discontinuation after the 2022 model year. Throughout its existence, the EcoSport shares its platform with the Fiesta.

== First generation (BV226; 2003) ==
The first generation EcoSport was designed by Ford Brazil Development Center under the program code BV226, and the codename &quot;Amazon Project&quot;. It is based on the European Fiesta and Fusion MPV, sharing the same Ford B3 platform.

The EcoSport became one of Ford&#x27;s best-seller models in Brazil, consistently appearing on the twenty best selling vehicles. It was also popular in Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico. Its main competitors were the Fiat Palio Adventure and Volkswagen CrossFox. In 2011, cumulative sales reached 700,000.
===Versions and engines===
The EcoSport was available with five straight-four engines:
* Zetec-Rocam 1.0 L gasoline 8v supercharged, (discontinued in 2006)
* Zetec-Rocam 1.6 8v gasoline/ethanol, 
* Duratec 2.0 L gasoline 16v 
* Duratorq 1.4 L TDCi Diesel, (export only)

All models have front-wheel drive with manual transmission as standard. The 2.0 L model can also receive a four speed automatic transmission (FWD only) or four-wheel drive (manual six speed only). In the latter case, an electronically controlled system automatically engages the rear axle when front wheel spin is detected, and also lets the driver manually engage the rear axle from the dashboard.

===Restyling===

At the end of 2007, a mid-cycle restyling was introduced, which renewed completely the front to bring it closer to then current Ford pickups, as well as the contemporary Brazilian restyling of the Ford Fiesta. Also updated were the rear lights, both bumpers, and the interior with a new dashboard using better quality materials.

===Mexico===
The Ford EcoSport arrived in Mexico in late 2003 as a 2004 model. The reception by the public was impressive and continued until 2006. For the model year of 2007, sales of the small SUV began slipping and it stopped being a hot seller. Compared to 15,000 units sold in 2004, only 10,000 units of the model year of 2007 were sold. This trend continued to worsen for the refreshed model year of 2008 due in part to a price increase.

Only 6,345 units of the model year 2008 were sold, and the model year 2009 sales through July 2009 were a mere 2,135 units. Due to decreasing sales, and heightened competition from the Ford Escape, Ford announced that a shortened 2010 model year would be the last sold in Mexico.

== Second generation (B515; 2012) ==

The second-generation EcoSport was developed under Ford&#x27;s global product development process in Ford Brazil Development Center. Designated under the project code B515 and the model code BK in Australia, it was based on the Fiesta B2E platform. The second-generation EcoSport was first showcased as a concept at the 2012 New Delhi Auto Expo, in India on 4 January 2012, and was launched in Brazil on 14 July 2012.

Ford showed the production variant of the Ford EcoSport in China, planning to begin sales in March 2013. In addition to China, the vehicle was also made at Ford India&#x27;s Chennai plant, for domestic sale and export initially to the European, and by 2018, the North American, markets. Ford&#x27;s Rayong plant in Thailand produced the EcoSport for Southeast Asian markets.

As of August 2015, Ford&#x27;s Indian plant had already sold 200,000 EcoSports; 112,000 of which were sold in India while the rest were exported to South Africa, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and Europe. In November 2016, Ford announced plans to supply the EcoSport from India to the United States.

In some countries, The EcoSport has a 1.0-litre three cylinder turbocharged &quot;EcoBoost&quot; petrol engine which has a power output of and of torque. The engine has Twin Independent Variable Camshaft Timing (Ti-VCT) which contributes to the turbocharged engine&#x27;s peak torque starting at 1,300 rpm. The EcoSport can tow up to .

In 2018, Ford ended passenger cars production in Thailand, effectively ending EcoSport production. Ford continues to build pickup trucks and its SUV derivative in the country. In 2019, Ford Sollers closed their factory in Naberezhnye, Chelny (Russia) ending production of EcoSport in Russia. In 2020, the EcoSport was discontinued from Ford&#x27;s Australia and New Zealand lineup, with the European-market Ford Puma serving as its replacement. In late 2021, Ford ended production of the EcoSport in India, and in Vietnam in early 2022.

On 11 January 2021, Ford announced to shutter three production plants in Brazil as part of cost-saving measures. As a result, production of the EcoSport in Brazil was ceased at immediate effect, with the car discontinued in Brazil, alongside the Ka (Figo) and Troller T4.

=== Powertrains ===
Engines available include the 1.0-litre &quot;EcoBoost&quot; developed at Ford&#x27;s Dunton Technical Center in the UK. It is a turbocharged, cast aluminium block three cylinder made in a and version, with the latter delivering a peak torque of from 1,300–4,500 rpm and on overboost. The use of aluminium for the engine block instead of cast-iron improved engine warm-up time by 50 percent.

The three-cylinder engine design causes inherent vibrations, which are countered by a deliberately unbalanced flywheel, which has less friction than balance shafts.

The exhaust manifold is cast into the cylinder head, reducing engine warm up time. The engine block&#x27;s height and width dimensions are comparable to an A4 size sheet of paper. This EcoSport version was available in China, Europe, India, the United States, but not Brazil. The Brazilian EcoSport has a 1.6 litre petrol engine, which produces and torque.

The Russian EcoSport comes with two different engines: a 1.6-litre, which produces 122 bhp (90 kW) and 148 Nm, and a 2.0-litre, which produces 140 bhp (90 kW) and 186 Nm. The 2.0-litre version of EcoSport comes as AWD with manual transmission, while the 1.6-litre is 2WD only but available with six speed manual or PowerShift automotive transmissions.

Along with the 1.0-litre &quot;EcoBoost&quot; engine, the Chinese and the Indian market also get a 1.5-litre Ti-VCT petrol engine, which produces and 140 Nm (103 lb.ft). The EcoSport also has a 1.5-litre TDCi BS6 diesel engine that outputs power at 3,750 rpm and of torque at 1,750-2,500 rpm.

=== Marketing ===
==== India ====
The Indian market was among the first few to receive EcoSport. The car was manufactured at Ford India&#x27;s Chennai plant, available in Six trims (Ambiente, Trend, Titanium, Titanium+, Sports &amp; Thunder edition) with the choice of two engine options, 1.5-litre Ti-VCT &quot;Dragon&quot; series petrol engine and 1.5-litre TDCi diesel engine. The engines are available with five speed manual and only petrol engine available with 6-speed torque converter transmission. The 1.0-litre &quot;EcoBoost&quot; petrol engine has been dropped after the vehicle has been upgraded to meet the BS6 emission compliance norms.

In 2017, the facelifted EcoSport contains 80% Indian parts.

==== Japan ====
At its introduction internationally, it was also made available in Japan, as the smallest companion to the Ford Kuga and the Ford Explorer. All engines except the diesel are offered in Japan, with a five-speed manual or six-speed dual clutch transmission, and optional all-wheel drive.

==== Europe ====
Ford launched the EcoSport in Europe during 2014, with a limited first batch of 500 units arriving in the first quarter of the year. The announcement was made in September 2013, at the IFA exhibition in Berlin, and the first limited edition versions could be ordered on a dedicated website. After disappointing sales figures in Europe in 2014, during which the EcoSport only sold 11,000 units against over 100,000 for each of its main competitors, the car was revised in 2015, to make it more suitable to European tastes. In March 2016, it was announced that the Ford EcoSport would be built in Romania, at Craiova plant starting from the autumn of 2017, moving production for the European market from the current plant in Chennai, India. This happened on the background of the growing market for the SUV segment in Europe, and would bring an investment of €200 million to the factory.

=== Safety ===
The Ford EcoSport has Ford SYNC driver connect system, a command system codeveloped with Microsoft. It also has airbags, anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), electric power assisted steering (EPAS), and Hill Launch Assist, Traction control System (TCS) and rear parking sensors.

The EcoSport in its most basic Latin American market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants and 3 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in March 2013.

The updated EcoSport in its most basic Latin American market configuration received 5 stars for adult occupants and 3 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in November 2013.

The EcoSport in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars from Euro NCAP in 2013.

=== 2017 facelift ===
The EcoSport&#x27;s mid-cycle updates were announced at 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show for the 2018 model year, including a revised front end design, and a redesigned rear bumper. The dashboard has an optional 8-inch floating touchscreen infotainment system that supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

Sales of the EcoSport in the US market began in 2018. Early models include the 1.0 &quot;EcoBoost&quot; three-cylinder turbo gasoline engine for FWD models and the 2.0 four cylinder petrol naturally aspirated engine for 4WD models. Both engines have a six-speed automatic transmission. The Australian-, Canadian- and US-market EcoSports, made in India, have the rear mounted spare tire as optional on the base model.

=== 2021 facelift ===
The EcoSport was due to receive a facelift for the Indian market, but was cancelled suddenly as the Sanand plant will be closing in the fourth quarter of 2021 along with the Chennai plant in the second half of 2022. As a result of that, a stop production of the EcoSport was issued through Ford of India. Additionally, all models that were due to be exported to Argentina, Mexico, Canada, and the US have all been cancelled as well, however, the EcoSport will still be sold in Europe and will be built at facility in Romania. Its Indian production restarted on 24 September 2021 for 2 years.

=== Discontinuation ===
The EcoSport was discontinued in the US and India in mid-2022, due to decreased sales and Ford ending manufacturing in India. In the US market, the new entry-level model will be the Ford Maverick pickup truck. The EcoSport remained on sale in the Mexican market until 2022.

Ford discontinued production of the Ecosport at the Craiova factory in Romania at the end of 2022, but sales will continue from accumulated stock in Europe until the end of 2023.

<text>The Military Freefall Parachutist Badge is a military badge of the United States Army and United States Air Force awarded to qualified U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force personnel as high-altitude military parachute specialists.

==Qualifications==
To earn the Military Freefall Parachutist Badge, the military member first must receive all necessary ground training, already have earned the Military Parachutist Badge (jump-qualified), and must have completed the requisite freefall (night, combat equipment, oxygen) jumps and graduate from the Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course.

A star and laurel wreath, centered above the badge, called the Master Military Freefall Parachutist Badge, is authorized for U.S. Army Soldiers and U.S. Air Force Airmen qualified as a Master Military Freefall Parachutist (Jumpmaster). Such qualification requires completing the Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course, wherein the student learns how to be a jumpmaster in military freefall operations.

As with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Military Parachutist Badge, small bronze and gold stars are placed on the badge to represent participation in combat jumps, known as Combat Jump Devices, and can be awarded with either the basic and master versions of the badge. To earn the device, a Military Freefall Parachutist must have conducted a High-altitude/low-opening (HALO) or high-altitude/high-opening (HAHO) jump in a war zone. The stars are awarded as follows:

==History of the badge&#x27;s design==
The original design of the Military Freefall Parachutists Badge was submitted in March 1983 by Sergeant First Class Gregory A. Dailey of Special Forces ODA-552, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group. Updates on the design, adding a Master Military Freefall Parachutist Badge, were submitted by General Wayne A. Downing of U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and James Phillips of the Special Forces Association. The badges were approved for wear by U.S. Army soldiers assigned to U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) on 1 October 1994. Unrestricted wear was approved on 7 July 1997 by General Dennis Reimer.

Symbolism of the badge&#x27;s design:
*The dagger is a Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife, used by the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, and represents infiltration techniques.
*The arched tab represents tabs worn by special operations forces.
*The parachute is a seven-celled MT1-X, the first ram-air parachute to be adopted by the U.S. Military as the standard freefall canopy.
*The wings represent flight and airborne capabilities.

==Free-fall training==

The U.S. Military Free-Fall School (MFFS) is operated by the USASOC&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (SWCS), 2nd Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne), 2nd Battalion, Company B at the U.S. Army&#x27;s Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) in Arizona, which is the USSOCOM proponent for military freefall. The MFFS conducts four primary training courses, the Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course, the Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course, the Military Free-Fall Advanced Tactical Infiltration Course, and the Military Free-Fall Instructor Course. The U.S. Air Force also conducts the Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course—certified by the MFFS—at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona for airman that are not able to attend the MFFS&#x27;s jumpmaster course. Alternatively, detachments from the MFFS conduct the Military Free-Fall Jumpmaster Course via mobile training teams (MTT) for military free-fall units that have difficulty attending the course at the Yuma Proving Ground.
The Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course (MFFPC) is open to special operations forces assigned to military free-fall coded positions, parachute riggers, and select DoD civilian personnel or allied personnel assigned to military free-fall positions. To attend MFFPC, students must have graduated from the U.S. Army Airborne School and must meet specific medical requirements. Week one of the four-week course focuses on vertical wind tunnel body stabilization training at the MSG George A Bannar Wind Tunnel as well as parachute packing and an introduction to military free-fall operations. The remaining weeks focuses training on varying jump profiles using three airborne operations per training iteration, totaling 30 military free-fall operations per course encompassing various conditions and equipment loads. At the end of the course, students will have learned how to:
*Pack the RA-1 Military Free-Fall Advanced Ram-Air Parachute System main parachute and don the system
*Rigging/jumping procedures for weapons, combat equipment, night vision goggles and portable oxygen equipment
*Aircraft procedures
*Exit an aircraft from the door and ramp using dive and poised exit positions
*Emergency procedures and body stabilization

<doc id="963493" wikidata="Q1013057" url="?curid=963493" title="Writtle">
<text>Writtle is a village and civil parish west of Chelmsford, Essex, England. It has a traditional village green complete with duck pond and a Norman church, and was once described as &quot;one of the loveliest villages in England, with a ravishing variety of ancient cottages&quot;. The village is now home to Writtle University College, one of the UK&#x27;s oldest and largest land-based colleges and a partner institution of the University of Essex, the grounds of which once housed a Royal hunting lodge, later the possession of the De Brus and De Bohun families. 

The suggestion that Writtle is the birthplace of Robert the Bruce, as well as his father Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, is contested, though its possession and use by both is incontrovertible. From 1996 until 2017 Writtle hosted the annual southern V Festival within the grounds of Sir John Comyn&#x27;s Hylands Park. At the 2001 census, it had a population of 5,632, decreasing to 5,383 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

The Romans were present in Writtle shortly after the Roman conquest by Claudius, but the presence of a metalled road, numerous archaeological finds and the ease with which the river can be forded in Writtle are still not significant enough evidence to suggest that Writtle, rather than Chelmsford, was the site of the Roman town of &quot;Caesaromagus&quot;, as suggested by the Essex historian Philip Morant  (et al).

The place-name &#x27;Writtle&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Writelam&quot;. It appears in a charter circa 1136 as &quot;Writela&quot;. This was originally the name of the River Wid, as attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 692 where the river appears as &quot;Writolaburna&quot;. This name is thought to mean &#x27;babbling burn or brook&#x27;.

Named in the Little Domesday Book as a Royal demesne (manor) of 194 households, the village boasts the site of one of King John&#x27;s hunting lodges (circa 1210), sited within the grounds of the present HE institution Writtle College.

The estate and village were later a possession of Isabel de Brus (Bruce), via a 16 October 1241 grant of Henry III and a known residence of her grandson Robert, father to the future king. For a time thereafter it was leased to a Francis and Joan Bache, but the estate was taken by Isabel&#x27;s great-grandson, Robert The Bruce, King of Scots, in the 1320s. It was in Writtle in 1302 that Robert had married his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh; there is some evidence to suggest he was also born in the village rather than in Turnberry Castle, but the story is possibly conflated with that of his father of the same name. 

Another well known historic figure who lived in Writtle was Sir John Petre (1549–1613). He sat as a member of parliament for Essex from 1584 to 1587 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. In 1603 he was raised to the peerage as Baron John Petre, the first baron of Writtle. Baron Petre publicly acknowledged that he was a Roman Catholic and refused to follow the Church of England during the time of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. He died in October 1613, aged 63, and was succeeded in the barony by his son William, who later married Katherine Somerset. One person from Writtle who did help to bring about the English Reformation was John Bastwick (1593–1654), a religious zealot who opposed Roman Catholic ceremonial in the years before the outbreak of the English Civil War.

In August 1914 the 4th Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Regiment arrived in Writtle. The 4th Ox and Bucks Bn was part of the Territorial Force, or volunteer reserve, of the British Army. While in Writtle the men underwent physical and military training. On 14 October 1914 they paraded in the grounds of Hylands House in the presence of King George V. The Ox and Bucks left Writtle in April 1915.

According to a contemporary newspaper report Writtle was hit by a V-2 rocket on Friday 12 January 1945. The V-2 fell about 200 yards south of the River Wid bridge in a field belonging to Skeggs Farm. The impact crater was 30 feet across by 20 feet deep. 19 properties were extensively damaged and a further 218 slightly damaged including All Saints&#x27; Church. No casualties were reported, although two families in Bridge Street were made homeless.

==Climate==
Writtle has a mild variety of the British oceanic climate with warm summers at around and mild winters with highs of but with quite common minor frosts. Precipitation is relatively low by British standards at during the 1981–2010 average period.

==Two Emma Toc, Writtle==

Writtle holds a distinguished place in the history of radio broadcasting. In the early 1920s it was the site of the experimental Marconi station 2MT (&quot;Two Emma Toc&quot;), from where Captain Peter Eckersley made the name of the village famous with his station announcement &quot;this is Two Emma Toc, Writtle testing, Writtle testing&quot;.

The prefabricated hut from which the broadcast was made (constructed for use during the First World War, but never shipped to the war zone) was later relocated to King&#x27;s Road primary school in Chelmsford, and has now been re-erected with replica equipment at the Sandford Mill museum, near Sandon. The Writtle transmission station was also the last independent outside the BBC, suspending transmission in January 1923. Independent radio did not re-emerge in the UK till the 1960s.

==Writtle Church==

The Domesday Book of 1086 mentioning a church and priest in Writtle suggests that Christian worship in the village pre-dated the Norman Conquest; the early-13th-century nave and chancel seem to be extensions of an 11th-century construction, which itself replaced a Saxon church. 

During the medieval period, the church &quot;changed hands&quot; several times, revenues being received by the Prior of Bermondsey in the 12th century, and then by the Hospital of the Holy Ghost in Rome from the early 13th; the turbulent reign of Richard II saw the church being seized by the king, eventually coming under the control of William of Wykeham&#x27;s New College, Oxford in 1399.

The church has twice suffered arson attacks in recent history, the first in 1974, the second in 1991.

==Writtle Forest==
Writtle Forest was a Royal Forest. The legal area of the forest - the area to which Forest Law applied - corresponded to the large ancient parish of Writtle, but the physical forest, the area of wood and commons was much smaller, and located in the still well wooded high ground in the south of the parish, stretching from College Wood to Edney Common. The Forest included hermitage called &quot;Bedemansburg&quot;, founded by King Stephen in the 1100s, and a Deer Park which was in place some time before 1237.

The woods (such as Great and Little Stoneymoor Woods) and plains (Mill Green) that lay south of the Writtle parish boundary, resembled the Forest but were not part of it.

==Longmeads House==
Longmeads House is a large Victorian building with grounds, and an important feature of the village. It was built by Robert Woodhouse in the 1880s and remained in the family until it was acquired by the Seabrooke family in 1930. The estate was acquired by Essex County Council in 1950 and had been the village&#x27;s community centre until 2020, as it was sold to a development company in 2013 to become residential dwellings. 

A new community centre named &#x27;The Beryl Platt Centre&#x27; has been built in the garden of Longmeads House, which now takes the place of Longmeads House as the village&#x27;s community centre.

<text>Sheepshead Bay is a neighborhood in southern Brooklyn, New York City. It is bounded by Ocean Parkway to the west; Avenue T and Kings Highway to the north; Nostrand Avenue and Gerritsen Avenue to the east; and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. Sheepshead Bay is abutted by the neighborhoods of Brighton Beach, Manhattan Beach, Coney Island and Homecrest, to the west; Midwood to the north; and Gerritsen Beach to the east.

The neighborhood is named after a bay that separates mainland Brooklyn from the eastern portion of Coney Island &amp; the Southern portion of Manhattan Beach &amp; Brighton Beach which was originally one of the Outer Barrier islands but is now a peninsula. The mouth of the bay is about southwest of Marine Park.

Sheepshead Bay is part of Brooklyn Community District 15, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11229 and 11235. It is patrolled by the 61st Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 46th and 48th Districts.

==History==

=== Fishing and tourism destination ===

The name &quot;Sheepshead Bay&quot; applies to the neighborhood north of the bay as well as the bay itself. Sheepshead Bay was named for the sheepshead, an edible fish found in the bay&#x27;s waters. Originally an extension of the town of Gravesend to the west, Sheepshead Bay was a secluded fishing and farming community early in its history.

Starting in the 1840s, residents of Brooklyn and Manhattan were drawn to the community as a summer destination. Hunters and fishermen started coming to Sheepshead Bay and various restaurants and hotels were erected. Sheepshead Bay&#x27;s allure as a fishing destination was further helped by the opening of Ocean Avenue in 1876 and the extension of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Manhattan Beach Branch in 1877–1878, which brought visitors both to the community of Sheepshead Bay and to the Manhattan Beach resort across the bay. The first of the community&#x27;s farms was split up into several lots for residential development in 1877. Three years later the Sheepshead Bay Race Track opened in the neighborhood, bringing even more visitors during the spring and fall. Near the racecourse, racing investor William Collins Whitney constructed a training track. A &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; was built on Emmons Avenue east of East 27th Street, while socialites tended to go to restaurants such as Tappan&#x27;s.

The track would continue to operate as a horse-racing course until 1910 when horse betting was criminalized in New York state. Afterward it operated as an auto racing track from 1915 to 1919. The decline of the Sheepshead Bay Race Track, along with the construction of amusement parks at nearby Coney Island and the proximity of Coney Island&#x27;s attractions to the newly built subway, led to the decline of Sheepshead Bay as a tourist destination. Passenger rail service on the Manhattan Beach Branch ceased in 1924, and the line was formally abandoned in 1937. The former race track site was subdivided for the construction of housing, and Millionaire&#x27;s Row was soon lined with bungalows. The closure of the race track resulted in a plethora of newly vacant plots in the community of Sheepshead Bay, and by extension, an influx of residents.

=== Filling of creek and waterfront development ===

The bay itself was originally the easterly entrance to Coney Island Creek, which was long and minimally navigable through the 20th century. A map from 1898 shows that numerous inlets protruded from the bay into the community. From the late 19th century through the early 20th century there were plans to turn the creek into the &quot;Gravesend Ship Canal&quot;. The plan including re-dredging the creek into a canal running in a straight east-west line and filling all the marsh land either side of the creek to expand the urban grid to the edge of the canal. However, this never happened. Squan Creek, a tributary of the Coney Island Creek, ran through the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood. While Squan Creek was infilled in the 1920s, its route is still evidenced by Sheepshead Bay Road&#x27;s crooked route through the street grid, as well as the presence of several dead-end streets that used to abut the creek&#x27;s route.

With the development of the Sheepshead Bay community into a residential neighborhood, there were efforts to improve the facilities on the waterfront. The channel of the Sheepshead Bay waterway was dredged by 1916 to allow fishing boats to dock there; previously these craft had to dock at Canarsie. In 1922 the New York City Dock Commission proposed to dredge the bays further, build bulkheads on the shore, and widen Emmons Avenue on the waterfront from . 25 piers would be built on the south side of Emmons Avenue while 26 buildings, including a new Lundy&#x27;s Restaurant location, would be built on the north side. Residents expressed concerns that the bay might become a commercial shipping port, and local fishermen opposed the city&#x27;s plan to establish a fish market there. A compromise to use Sheepshead Bay only for private and charter boats was reached in 1929, and the city built several piers at an angle from the bulkhead to prevent trucks from loading onto these piers.

In 1931, the city condemned several buildings on the bay shore, including the original Lundy&#x27;s Restaurant, to widen Emmons Avenue. The Great Depression delayed further progress, as these buildings would not be destroyed until mid-1934, and construction started on new buildings on Emmons Avenue&#x27;s northern sidewalk. At that point a newspaper article noted that Emmons Avenue had been &quot;transformed by attractive looking restaurants and stores.&quot; In 1936, the city and the owners of the condemned buildings reached a monetary settlement, and by the following year, the channel had been dredged and ten docks had been constructed. The filling-in of the central part of the Coney Island during the 1930s, in conjunction with construction of the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway. Shore Parkway opened in 1941, and soon afterward, the last remaining farms in Sheepshead Bay were redeveloped into residential buildings.

=== Later development ===
Sheepshead Bay became populated by Jewish and Soviet immigrants during the late 20th century, similar to neighboring Brighton Beach. In 1978, in one of the largest disasters in Sheepshead Bay&#x27;s modern history, six firefighters were killed while fighting the Waldbaum&#x27;s supermarket fire. Sheepshead Bay did not undergo the white flight and high crime that afflicted other New York City neighborhoods. Lundy&#x27;s closed in 1979, resulting in the closure of retail on Emmons Avenue. After the closure of Lundy&#x27;s, Sheepshead Bay transformed from a predominantly Irish and Italian enclave into a more racially diverse neighborhood, and the population became increasingly elderly. Recreational fishing along the bay also started to decline in the surrounding community. In the 1970s, the city created a maritime zoning district on Emmons Avenue to promote waterfront development.

In the last decade of the 20th century, a real estate boom brought the reopening of Lundy&#x27;s Restaurant, which was made a city landmark in 1992. Furthermore, Loehmann&#x27;s proposed a store in Sheepshead Bay in 1993, the first major development in the area in several years, though the city rejected initial plans for the development after community opposition. After another proposal for a Loehmann&#x27;s shopping center was rejected, Mayor Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s administration approved a smaller version of the shopping center in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the reopening of Lundy&#x27;s in 1995 spurred a wave of development on Emmons Avenue. By March 1996, property owners reported that real estate prices had doubled and that vacant apartments were being occupied. With new development, housing prices in the area increased sharply, and there were concerns about a dearth of parking, since the new developments had collectively resulted in the removal of 2,000 parking spots in Sheepshead Bay. Also in the mid-1990s, a small amusement park called Fun Time USA opened on Knapp Street, operating for almost 11 years before closing in 2005.

Lundy&#x27;s closed again in 2007; a shopping center took its place. Soviet-style restaurants/nightclubs opened along the waterfront. Sheepshead Bay has also experienced a growth of condominium developments, and on Emmons Avenue, the northern shoreline street along the bay, are piers boasting an active seafood market and tour boats.

<text>Manhattan Beach is a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east, by Sheepshead Bay on the north, and Brighton Beach to the west. Traditionally known as an Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish neighborhood, it is also home to a sizable community of Sephardi Jews and a large Russian Jewish immigrant presence.

Manhattan Beach is part of Brooklyn Community District 15, and its primary ZIP Code is 11235. It is patrolled by the 61st Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 48th District. The area is also represented by the Manhattan Beach Community Group, established in 1941, and the Manhattan Beach Neighborhood Association, established in 2008.

==History==

Manhattan Beach was the most upscale of the three major resort areas that developed at Coney Island shortly after the American Civil War; the other two areas were Brighton Beach and West Brighton.
It was developed in the last quarter of the 19th century as a resort by Austin Corbin, later president of the Long Island Rail Road, for whom the street Corbin Place, which marks the boundary between Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach, was named. In 1877, Corbin built the famous Manhattan Beach Hotel, followed by the even grander Oriental Hotel in 1880. The Coney Island Jockey Club horse racing track opened nearby at the same time as Corbin&#x27;s Oriental Hotel; together, these three establishments drew thousands of visitors to Manhattan Beach. The hotels held daily concerts led by famous conductors such as Conterno, Gilmore, and John Philip Sousa, and hosted elaborate nightly fireworks displays, drawing tens of thousands of visitors on summer nights and making Manhattan Beach a renowned summer seaside resort. Sousa composed the &quot;Manhattan Beach&quot; march in 1893 to commemorate the beach resort. Corbin, an anti-Semite who served as the secretary of the American Society for the Suppression of Jews, barred Jews from the resort. In 1895, Corbin built a 12,000 capacity third-mile concrete cycling track behind the hotel at a cost of $30,000.

The U.S. Coast Guard operated a training station at Manhattan Beach during World War II.

After the deterioration of the hotel industry in the area, the site of the former Manhattan Beach hotel was developed into a residential area and into Manhattan Beach Park by the New York City Parks Department. Manhattan Beach Park opened to the public in 1955, to alleviate crowding at the neighboring beaches of Coney Island and Brighton Beach, and continues to serve the public today. From 1954 to 1959, the neighborhood was home to Manhattan Beach Air Force Station. From the 1980s, Manhattan Beach has become an enclave for higher end middle class Russian Jews. The Manhattan Beach Jewish Center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

==Political representation==
Politically, Manhattan Beach is in New York&#x27;s 8th congressional district. It is in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 22nd district, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 45th district, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 48th district.

==Police and crime==
Manhattan Beach is patrolled by the 61st Precinct of the NYPD, located at 2575 Coney Island Avenue.
The 61st Precinct ranked 5th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010.

The 61st Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 88.2% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 1 murder, 17 rapes, 150 robberies, 170 felony assaults, 169 burglaries, 584 grand larcenies, and 72 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

== Fire safety ==
Manhattan Beach is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)&#x27;s Engine Co. 246/Ladder Co. 169, located at 2732 East 11th Street.

==Education==
===Schools and institutes===

Kingsborough Community College, which is the part of the City University of New York, occupies the entire eastern tip of Manhattan Beach. The college&#x27;s halls and departments are spread out through the area. The Leon M. Goldstein High School for the Sciences is located on the campus of Kingsborough Community College.

The New York City Department of Education operates public schools in the area. Manhattan Beach is zoned to PS 195 Manhattan Beach School for grades K–5 and PS 225, the Eileen E. Zaglin School for grades pre school– middle school. In 1992, special education school PS 771K was opened at this building.

Private schools in the area include the Yeshiva of Manhattan Beach, a Jewish day school for grades K–8, and the Yeshiva Gedolah Bais Shimon of Manhattan Beach, which is a post-high school rabbinical program.

===Library===
While there is no location of the Brooklyn Public Library in Manhattan Beach, the Sheepshead Bay branch nearby is located at 2636 East 14th Street, near Avenue Z.

==Transportation==

=== Public transportation ===
Manhattan Beach is served by MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27; bus routes. Both operate along Oriental Boulevard.

=== Roads ===
The community&#x27;s street names, derived from England, are in alphabetical order from A to P. From west to east, they are named Amherst, Beaumont, Coleridge, Dover, Exeter, Falmouth, Girard, Hastings, Irwin, Jaffray, Kensington, Langham, Mackenzie, Norfolk, Oxford, and Pembroke; the names Quentin and Reynolds exist on old maps. The A-P streets are bounded by Shore Boulevard and Oriental Boulevard and are partially intersected by Hampton Avenue.

Corbin Place was originally named for Austin Corbin, the original developer of Manhattan Beach; in 2007, it was renamed M. Corbin Place for American Revolutionary War patriot Margaret Corbin. Austin Corbin had restricted Jewish guests at his hotel and enacted restrictive covenants to prevent Jews from buying real estate in the area. After Austin Corbin&#x27;s death the policy was canceled and the neighborhood attracted a large number of Jewish residents.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were 40,000+ White residents, there were between 10,000 and 19,999 Asian residents, 5,000 and 9,999 Hispanic residents, and less than 5000 Black residents.

<text>Measham is a large village in the North West Leicestershire district in Leicestershire, England, near the Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire boundaries. It lies off the A42, south of Ashby de la Zouch, in the National Forest. Historically it was in an exclave of Derbyshire absorbed into Leicestershire in 1897. The name is thought to mean &quot;homestead on the River Mease&quot;. The village was once part of Derbyshire before being transferred to Leicestershire.

==History==
===Early history===
The name &quot;Meas-Ham&quot; suggests it was founded in the Saxon period between 350 and 1000 CE.

Just before the Norman Conquest of 1066, the village belonged to &quot;Earl Algar&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 has it belonging directly to the King, as part of a royal estate centred at Repton. Its taxable value was assessed at a mere 2 geld units, containing land for three ploughs, of meadow, and a square furlong () of woodland.

===Middle Ages===
The manor passed from the crown to the Earls of Chester. In 1235 it was in the possession of Clementia (Clemence de Fougères), widow of Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester. Measham Museum states that the manor belonged to the De Measham family, which held it until 1308. Given the ownership by the crown and then the Earls of Chester, neither actually resident, it appears the De Measham family held the manor as feudal tenants, rather than formal owners, probably in return for military service.

By the 13th century, the rights to the church appear to have passed to Repton Priory, as in 1272 King Henry III issued a charter including Measham among several churches and chapelries it possessed. The original chapel of ease dated from 1172, but the present St Laurence&#x27;s Church was built in 1340, under the auspices of Repton Priory.

On 24 March 1311, King Edward II granted charters to William de Bereford, Lord of the Manor of Measham, to hold a market and a fair. The charters allowed for a market on Tuesdays and an annual three-day fair around the festival of the Translation of St Thomas the Martyr (7 July). By 1817 both market and fair had ceased.

This medieval settlement is thought to have been mainly agricultural, but coalmining is known to have taken place as early as the 13th century. Indeed, William De Bereford died getting coal; records of his death show the village&#x27;s coal resources to have been worth 13s 4d (£0.67) a year.

In 1355, Edmund de Bereford, son of William, died leaving the manor of Measham to three heirs: Joan de Ellesfield, John de Maltravers and Margaret de Audley. During the 15th century, the manor came into the hands of Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy. In 1454, the manor was in the possession of Sir William Babington at the time of his death; and in 1474 it was in the possession of John Babington (presumably his son).

===16th–17th centuries===
In 1596 Measham was dismissed by William Wyrley as &quot;a village belonging to Lord Shefield, in which are many coal mines, [but] little else worthy of remembrance.&quot; It was omitted altogether from Richard Blome&#x27;s gazetteer of market towns in 1673.

In 1563 the manor belonged to Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy. However, by 1616 it had passed to Sir Francis Anderson, only to return to the Sheffield family, as it was owned by Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1712.

===18th–19th centuries===

The manor passed to William Wollaston. He sold it in 1780 to Joseph Wilkes for £50,000, on whose death it was bought by Rev. Thomas Fisher. In 1767, William Abney built an alternative manor at Measham Field, north-east of the village, which by 1817 had passed to his son Edward. This would become known as Measham Hall, a seven-bay mid-Georgian mansion. However, the advent of coalmining caused the Hall to suffer subsidence. It was demolished by the National Coal Board in 1959.

By the early 19th century, Measham church was still associated with Repton parish, as a &quot;parochial chapelry&quot;.

====Industry====
Around the time of Joseph Wilkes, Measham went through a prosperous period associated with the Industrial Revolution. This lasted into the 20th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Ashby Canal was built through the village. The Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway followed, opening towards the end of the century. The village was also on the main Birmingham–Nottingham road (later the A453). It became a hub of local industry, famous for its brickworks: Joseph Wilkes&#x27;s &quot;Jumb Bricks&quot; were enlarged to reduce payments of brick tax. The village industry included banking, breweries, coal mines and brick-making (with clay from local clay pits), a tramway, and boot, lace, cotton, carding and bleach mills.

A market hall was said to have been built by Wilkes about the turn of the 19th century, but by 1817 the market had ceased and the market-house at 58 High Street was being converted into a dwelling. This later became known as Cross House. The original market place was an area to the rear in Queen Street, now a car park.

The village Baptist chapel was built in 1811, although Baptist ministers had been active since the 1730s. A Temperance Hall built in 1852 now serves as the Age Concern building.

In 1839 the village received an official visit from Queen Adelaide, who in her widowhood frequented the area, staying at nearby Gopsall Park, home of her previous Lord Chamberlain, The Earl of Howe. &quot;Queen Street&quot; was named in her honour after her visit.
By 1848 the population had reached 1,615. A further Methodist chapel and a Catholic church were built. The latter, funded by a local lady aristocrat, has since been demolished for housing.

===20th–21st centuries===
Measham continued to grow residentially and industrially in the 20th and 21st centuries. Large council and private housing estates were built and the population reached 4,849 in 2001. Development of a British Car Auctions site in the south-west of the village after the Second World War prompted what has become the Westminster Industrial Estate.

The 20th century also brought periods of sharp decline. Passenger services on the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway ceased in 1931. Freight traffic continued until 1971, after which the line was dismantled. Ashby Canal similarly closed in 1957. The traditional industries began to die, with the boot and shoe factory closing in the 1960s and Measham Colliery in 1986. The 1960s saw many of the village&#x27;s fine buildings demolished, including the Manor House, Measham Hall and the Vicarage.

Development has resumed in recent years. Years of neglect and disrepair at Measham&#x27;s former railway station ended when it was turned into new premises for the Measham Museum. The old engine sheds have become industrial workshops and the engine yards a millennium garden and public green space. A new library and a leisure centre were also built in the last decade, and there are plans to resuscitate the canal. Due to housing being constructed along the original route through Measham, the canal will follow the route of the old railway, with a wharf, adjacent visitors&#x27; centre, shops and cafés planned for the village centre.

==Measham teapots==
Measham has a long pottery history: extraction of clay was recorded in the 13th century. The Measham Ware associated with canals and narrow boats was made from the last quarter of the 19th century until about 1914 (other sources say 1910), not in Measham, but in nearby villages, mainly Church Gresley. It is thought to have gained the attribute Measham from large sales by Mrs Anne Bonas from a shop in Measham High Street.

Measham ware has a dark brown Rockingham glaze with white-clay additions colourfully painted, usually with flowers and often a personal motto. Most commonly seen are teapots, often with a miniature-teapot shape as a finial.

Earliest known production was in 1870 by William Mason of Church Gresley (later Mason Cash); this list refers to pieces as &quot;Motto Ware&quot;, later also &quot;Barge Ware&quot; due to canal associations. Measham Ware was popular with canal people. On passing through Measham on the Ashby Canal, they would place their order for a personalised teapot as they passed through and collect it on their next visit. Measham Ware was also popular among farm labourers in Norfolk and Suffolk: after harvesting in their own counties, they often travelled to Burton Upon Trent to work in the maltings and other industries associated with brewing. Measham Ware became a popular gift to take home. Locals often bought them as wedding gifts, passing them down the generations at weddings. Production of Measham Ware ended around 1910–1914, although modern reproductions have been produced more recently. There is a large collection in the Measham Museum. London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum also has an example on display.

==Rail transport==
The nearest main line railway station is Atherstone (). Others nearby are Burton-on-Trent, Leicester, Tamworth and Nuneaton.

A branch of the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway (ANJR) opened to Measham in 1873, with through services to Burton-on Trent, Leicester, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Moira and Shackerstone, allowing changes for Coalville and Loughborough via Hugglescote. The station closed in 1931, but the line stayed open until 1970, when British Rail closed the Shackerstone–Measham section. The stub to Moira remained for coal traffic from Donisthorpe Colliery until 1981. The Battlefield Line Railway, a surviving section of the ANJR, now runs services to Shenton via Market Bosworth. It had been hoped to extend this to Snarestone, but nothing came of it. Leicestershire County Council recently renovated the station building as part of the Ashby Canal restoration, to serve as premises for the Measham Museum.

==Minorca opencast==
In 2011 UK Coal received planning permission to develop an opencast coal mine on the site of the former Minorca colliery on the outskirts of Measham. Measuring by , it will yield of coal over five years, and of clay. The development was opposed by some local residents worried about environmental effects and vehicle noise.
==Sport==
The local football team, Measham Welfare Football Club, fields various teams and offers football to local children of 6–18. The club is based at Measham Leisure Centre.

Measham hosts the National Forest Taekwondo group, which started in 2013 and trains at the Church Hall. It welcomes all practitioners from the age of eight up, and covers training in all areas of this Olympic sport, from self-defence to the traditional patterns.

<text>The MB.81 was a French military aircraft built by Société des Avions Marcel Bloch as a flying ambulance since it was designed to carry one passenger, in or out of a stretcher. Developed in response to a government-sponsored competition in support of the new doctrine of &quot;aerial first aid&quot;, it was employed exclusively in the overseas colonies, specifically Morocco and Syria. Unlike the MB.80 prototype, the MB.81 had a closed cockpit and a somewhat larger cargo space. This was the company&#x27;s first design to reach production.

==History==
The aircraft was designed to be able to seek patients or casualties by scouting, even at high altitudes, during military operations in mountainous countries, like then-French Morocco over the Atlas Mountains.

The main design feature made it possible to transport a casualty lying prone, in a compartment placed between the pilot and the engine. The wings could also be adapted to hold casualties, remaining constantly under the sight of the pilot and connected to him by an Aviaphone communication system.

The MB.80 made its first flight at the beginning of summer 1932 in Villacoublay, piloted by Zacharie Heu. An all-metal monoplane with low wings, it was equipped with a French Lorraine 5Pc of which allowed it to reach a speed of at an altitude of It was able to take off in and to land in . In a 1932 test, the MB.80 carried out 209 landings in thirty-six hours without any problems.

The aircraft was built without any assistance from the government, but an initial order of 20 was placed by the Ground French Forces (the French Armée de l&#x27;Air was founded in 1933), and it was one of the aircraft that relaunched Marcel Bloch in the aeronautical construction industry.

The production model, called the MB.81, was fitted with a French Salmson 9Nd of 128.68 kW (175 hp). It took part in military operations in Morocco and in Syria at the beginning of the 1930s.

The MB.81 entered service in 1935, and was used extensively throughout North Africa and the Middle East. A few were used in 1939-1940, before the French surrender, and in July 1941 in the battle for Syria between the Vichy French and the British/Free French.

<text>South Station, officially The Governor Michael S. Dukakis Transportation Center at South Station, is the largest railroad station and intercity bus terminal in Greater Boston and New England&#x27;s second-largest transportation center after Logan International Airport. Located at the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and Summer Street in Dewey Square, Boston, Massachusetts, the historic station building was constructed in 1899 to replace the downtown terminals of several railroads. Today, it serves as a major intermodal domestic transportation hub, with service to the Greater Boston region and the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. It is used by thousands of commuter rail and intercity rail passengers daily. Connections to the rapid transit Red Line and bus rapid transit Silver Line are made through the adjacent subway station.

The station was renamed for former Massachusetts governor Michael S. Dukakis in November 2014, though maps and station signs continue to use the shorter &quot;South Station&quot;.

==History==
===Need for a combined station===
When the railroads serving Boston were first laid out and built, each one stopped at its own terminal. The four terminals serving the south-side railroads were as follows:
* The New York and New England Railroad crossed the Fort Point Channel from South Boston, just south of the present Summer Street Bridge, and terminated just east of Dewey Square (right at the north end of today&#x27;s South Station).
* The Old Colony Railroad had a long passenger terminal on the east side of South Street, stretching from Kneeland Street south to Harvard Street. This site is now part of the South Bay Interchange, near the South Station bus terminal.
* The Boston and Albany Railroad&#x27;s passenger terminal was in the block bounded by Kneeland Street, Beach Street, Albany Street (now Surface Artery) and Lincoln Street. This later became a freight house, and is now a block in Chinatown; the passenger terminal was moved to the west side of Utica Street, from Kneeland Street south to a bit past Harvard Street, now part of the South Bay Interchange.
* The Boston and Providence Railroad continued straight where it now merges with the Boston and Albany, terminating at Park Square, with the passenger terminal on the south side of Providence Street from Columbus Avenue west about two-thirds of the way to Berkeley Street.

By the late 19th century, the New England, Old Colony, and Boston &amp; Providence had been acquired by the New York &amp; New Haven Railroad, while the B&amp;A was acquired by the New York Central Railroad. However, the four separate terminals remained. The Boston Terminal Company, established in 1897, was charged with the task of consolidating service from the four terminals at a single terminal (a union station).

===Early years===
South Station opened in 1899 at a cost of $3.6 million (1899 dollars). The architects were Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston, and the construction was undertaken by the engineering firm of Westinghouse, Church, Kerr &amp; Co. The station opened on January 1 for use by Old Colony Division and Midland Division trains, the latter of which had been using the Old Colony terminal since August 22, 1896 to allow for construction. B&amp;A trains began using South Station on July 23, followed by Providence Division trains on September 10 (along with the opening of Back Bay station).

It became the busiest station in New England by 1913. A stop on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated served South Station from 1901 to 1938; what is now the Red Line subway was extended from Park Street to South Station in 1913. The train shed, originally one of the largest in the world, was eliminated in a 1930 renovation due to corrosion caused by the nearby ocean&#x27;s salt air.

In the original configuration, two tracks came off each approach to join into a four-track line and then run under the main platforms in a two-track loop. These tracks were never put into service, and later became a parking lot and bowling alley for employees.

While the station handled 125,000 passengers each day during World War II, post-war passenger rail traffic declined in the US. In 1959, the New Haven&#x27;s Old Colony Division–successor of the Old Colony Railroad–which had served the South Shore and Cape Cod, stopped passenger service. The New Haven itself went bankrupt in 1961. South Station was sold to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in 1965. Portions of the station were demolished and the land was used to build the Boston South Postal Annex and the Stone and Webster building.

In the early 1970s, the BRA developed plans to demolish the rest of the station and replace it with a multi-use development including a new train station, a bus station, a parking garage, and commercial structures. The plan was never realized, and South Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

===Renovations===

In 1978, the BRA sold what was left of the station to the MBTA, though the BRA retained air rights over the station. Funding was obtained for a major renovation of the station that was completed in 1989. A total of 13 tracks became available, all with high level platforms and some capable of handling 12-car trains. Piers were installed for the eventual construction of an office building and bus station above the tracks. This renovation also added direct access to the Red Line subway station from inside the surface station lobby; previously, the only access was via street stairwells. The Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Big Dig) occupied almost all of the building&#x27;s office space beginning in July 1988.

After some delays, an inter-city bus terminal opened in October 1995, replacing one on top of the I-93 Dewey Square Tunnel diagonally across from the station between Summer Street and Congress Street. The new bus terminal has direct ramp connections to I-93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike. The renovations, including the bus terminal, cost $195 million in 2001 dollars.

In September 2017, the Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation, which also owns the Faneuil Hall Marketplace, purchased the 98-year lease on the office space and concourse areas of the station from the Blackstone Group for $123.2 million.

In August 2019, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded MassDOT up to $41.2 million to replace much of the Tower 1 interlocking outside South Station. The remaining $41 million of the $82 million project will be funded by Amtrak and the MBTA. , completion is expected in 2026. Bidding for the $68.7 million main construction contract opened in September 2022. The MBTA awarded the contract at a higher cost of $99 million in March 2023.

===South Station Tower===
When the Boston Redevelopment Authority sold South Station to the MBTA in 1977, the BRA retained the air rights over the tracks. The South Station Tower complex, which is being built on the air rights, will include a 51-story, skyscraper and an expansion of the bus terminal. Construction began in January 2020 and is expected to take four years. The tower is being built on foundations put in place when the station was last renovated. The project will include an expansion of the outdoor waiting area with a new arched roof, a roof covering the entire platform area, a new entrance from Dorchester Avenue, and a more direct connection to the bus terminal.
==Architecture==
The South Station head house and wings incorporate Neoclassical architecture. The building&#x27;s symmetry and stone façade are common to the style. The granite came from nearby quarries in New England. The main doorways are located in a section that protrudes from the curving shape of the building. The doors are housed under tall arches that give the impression of grandeur while also making the building appear smaller from far away. This visual trick is common in classical buildings and is further amplified by the oversized windows and large balustrade on the third floor and roof.

Above the doorways are classical Ionic order columns that ostensibly hold up the frieze and pediment. Uncommon for Ionic order columns is the lack of fluting, which is usually used to draw the eye upward, increasing the grandeur of the facade. The numerous projections and recessions on the façade attribute to the planar quality of the building, while also creating interesting shading and lighting patterns on the stone and within the building. Inside, a coffered ceiling adorns the terminal and protects travelers from the rain and snow.

Constructed over 100 years ago, the clock on top of the main head house is the largest operating hand-wound clock mechanism in New England. The clock is styled after London&#x27;s Big Ben, and has a wide face. The mechanism weighs over . In 2008, the clock underwent a six-week restoration and repair. The clock mechanism was completely disassembled and transported to a nearby workshop, where replacement pieces had to be fabricated by hand. The clock, once one of many in the city, is a hallmark of a bygone era—something that commuters rely on to make their trains, and which visitors admire for its historical presence. The stone eagle that sits atop the clock is wide and weighs over eight tons. The eagle imitates the figurines commonly placed atop classically styled buildings.

The curved shape of the building facade pushes its presence into the surrounding area, making it much more prominent. This also gives the building a more distinctive and accessible main entrance from Atlantic Avenue, Summer Street, and Dewey Square. A similar concept is also seen in the Santa Maria della Pace in Rome, Italy. This church did not directly influence South Station, but the designs clearly share the same effects on the immediate area.

In the 1980s, with South Station in disrepair, a great effort began to revitalize the station using Federal funding. The revitalization included addition of two wings that extend from each side of the head house, constructed with granite from the same quarries to provide a consistent appearance. Renovation and expansion was completed in 1989, reinvigorating the area with a vital transportation link and a strong focal point. Office buildings began rising nearby, expanding the downtown area. With the completion of the Big Dig and the Rose Kennedy Greenway, South Station has become an even more important feature in the area. The Greenway provides a pedestrian-friendly connection between South Station and North Station.

Two works of public art, installed as part of the Arts on the Line program, are located inside South Station:
*&quot;Destinations&quot; (1995) by Jeffrey Schiff consists of 25 cast iron spindles hanging from the ceiling of the entrance foyer. Schiff was originally commissioned in 1980 for an artwork that would have consisted of granite columns in the main waiting room.
*&quot;Musclebound for Miami&quot; (1991) by Mayer Spivack is a sculpture made from Type H railroad couplers located near the information desk. It was originally commissioned in 1981.

==Services==
South Station is served by heavy rail, rapid transit, and bus. It is the northern terminus of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and is served by the &quot;Acela Express&quot;, the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, and the Boston section of the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;. It is also the downtown terminus of the nine southern lines of the MBTA Commuter Rail system. An underground subway station serves the Red Line and the Silver Line bus rapid transit system&#x27;s Waterfront routes (SL1, SL2, and SL3). Local bus service on lines 4, 7, and 11 and rapid service to on Silver Line route SL4 also stop at South Station.

South Station&#x27;s amenities include:

* Parking garage
* Staffed ticket windows
* 24-hour baggage assistance
* A 24-hour information booth
* A Metropolitan Lounge with several complimentary services
* A food court, small shopping variety, and waiting area, with typical train station concessions. Food vendors include Auntie Anne&#x27;s/Carvel, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, McDonald&#x27;s, Starbucks, Tavern in The Square and Regina Pizzeria. Shopping vendors include a Boston-themed souvenir shop, a LovePop Card booth, a two-floor CVS Pharmacy.
* Public art, including a sculpture built of railroad car couplers and a model of the planet Jupiter (the latter is part of the Museum of Science&#x27;s scale model of the Solar System)
* Free Wi-Fi

The commuter rail and Amtrak platforms are fully accessible, with level access from the main station entrance and the waiting area onto the high-level platforms. Elevators are provided for step free access to the subway station. The bus station can be reached via the track 1 platform.
===Bus terminal===

Boston&#x27;s main inter-city bus terminal, the South Station Bus Terminal, is housed in a separate building built over the train platforms along Atlantic Avenue. The bus terminal hosts service by Greyhound, Peter Pan, and other bus companies; to all of New England, New York City, upstate New York, Atlantic City (New Jersey), Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., the mid-Atlantic states, and Montreal, Canada. The bus terminal has its own concession area, and can be entered from the railway platform area or directly from Atlantic Avenue.
==South Station Expansion Project==
As a major transfer station offering connections to multiple modes, South Station is expected to see additional passenger throughput as a result of system improvements and a general increase in ridership. The existing underground Red Line and Silver Line stations are adequate for the near future, but the surface-level commuter rail and Amtrak platforms are at capacity.

A proposed relocation of the Boston General Mail Facility, which is located on Dorchester Avenue next to the station tracks, would allow for increased capacity at South Station. Seven more tracks are planned to be added to the existing thirteen tracks, allowing increased use by both MBTA Commuter Rail and Amtrak trains.

In October 2010, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was awarded a $32.5 million grant from the federal government to begin planning for this expansion. After deliberations, a $43 million contract (including $10.5 million in state funds) was awarded in August 2012. The planning project will advance the new station area, including a possible passenger mezzanine over the platforms, to the 30% design level. Other elements include a redesign of the South Station interlocking, new commuter rail layover facilities, and the restoration of public access to the adjacent section of Dorchester Avenue and the Fort Point Channel, filling in a missing half-mile segment of the Boston Harborwalk. The station expansion is intended to allow for increases in commuter rail service on the Fairmount Line and Framingham/Worcester Line, addition of South Coast Rail service, and increased Amtrak frequencies.

As of October 2014, purchasing of the postal facility is in limbo, as the Postal Service is not willing to accept the amount offered by the state. Part of this deal would include moving the facility to South Boston, with MassPort taking some of the Post Office&#x27;s parking lot located across Fort Point Channel.

The Final Environmental Impact Report for the South Station Expansion Project was released on June 30, 2016. The project would begin with the demolition of the postal facility and take 5 years to complete. The Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs approved the FEIR on August 12, 2016.

The South Station Expansion Project has been opposed by a number of transportation advocates, community groups, and environmental groups, many of which instead advocate building a North–South Rail Link (NSRL) through connection to North Station and points beyond, rather than expanding the dead-end storage capacity for trains at South Station. Prominent NSRL supporters include former Governor Michael S. Dukakis (Democrat) and former Governor William F. Weld (Republican), who have made joint public appearances regarding this issue. Based on their advocacy, MassDOT agreed to fund a $2 million study in February 2016. The NSRL reevaluation report was released in June 2018. Its tunnel options included a four-track maximum-service plan, estimated to cost $21.5 billion and three double-track routes ranging in cost from $12.3 to 14.7 billion. South Station expansion was estimated to cost $4.7 billion. These costs are in 2018 dollars and include purchasing additional rolling stock, other required infrastructure improvements and a 3.5% annual inflation rate.

<text>Paul Edmund Kanjorski (born April 2, 1937) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1985 until 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

The district included the cities of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton, as well as most of the Poconos.

Before his election to Congress, Kanjorski was a trial attorney, city solicitor, and administrative law judge for workers&#x27; compensation. He also served in the United States Army Reserves.

==Early life, education and career==
Kanjorski was born in Nanticoke, near Wilkes-Barre. He is Polish-American. He attended public schools before enrolling at Wyoming Seminary, a private college preparatory school in Kingston. He finished his high school education at the Capitol Page School in Washington, D.C. He became a congressional page at age 15, first appointed by Republicans but ending up working on the Democratic side of the House. He witnessed the 1954 U.S. Capitol shooting incident, helping to bring stretchers into the chamber for the wounded.

Kanjorski attended Temple University in Philadelphia from 1957 to 1961, and briefly served in the United States Army Reserves from 1960 to 1961. He then attended Dickinson School of Law in Carlisle. He passed the Pennsylvania bar exam in 1966. Kanjorski completed his studies despite having dyslexia, once saying, &quot;I always thought it was a blessing. It forced me to develop my memory.&quot;

Before entering politics, Kanjorski practiced law in Wilkes-Barre often helping coal miners and their widows obtain black lung benefits. Kanjorski also volunteered to advocate on behalf of victims of Hurricane Agnes which devastated the Wyoming valley in 1972. Kanjorski served as a worker&#x27;s compensation administrative law judge for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Assistant Solicitor for the City of Nanticoke and served as assistant solicitor to several other communities.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises (chairman)
**Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
**Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity
*Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
**Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and Procurement
**Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives

===Earmark controversy===
Kanjorski encountered controversy over earmarks that he secured for water jet cutter research towards Cornerstone Technologies, a company founded by his nephew and staffed by Kanjorski&#x27;s daughter and four other nephews. In 2004, former company president Bruce Conrad sued Cornerstone, alleging that Kanjorski and relatives schemed to take over Conrad&#x27;s stake in the company.

In 2007, &quot;Politico&quot; revealed that the United States Navy wanted back a high-pressure pump that had been purchased by Cornerstone using taxpayer funds, but Cornerstone could not locate it. Later, the Navy concluded that Cornerstone did not produce anything valuable towards national defense.

==Political positions==
Like many Pennsylvania Democrats from outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Kanjorski opposed gun control. He is also moderately conservative on abortion. However, he is strongly pro-labor, and has spoken out against the Iraq War. He has served on the Financial Services Committee since he entered Congress in 1985 and was the second-ranking Democrat on that committee at the time of his departure. He usually played behind-the-scenes roles in the advocacy or defeat of legislation and steers appropriations money toward improving the infrastructure and economic needs of his district. He is popularly known as &quot;Kanjo.&quot;

On May 10, 2007, the usually moderate Kanjorski voted with fellow Democrats to begin the redeployment of all forces from Iraq, however the bill was defeated. As of the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001, Kanjorski&#x27;s position on the war in Iraq appeared to be that he would vote for redeployment, but not as a condition of continued funding for the war until and unless the expected presidential veto of such a bill would be overridden.

After the August 1, 2007, collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Kanjorski said he believed the $250 million bill passed by Congress to rebuild the bridge was improper because it exceeded the normal $100 million limit for emergency relief projects. He added in saying that Minnesotans &quot;discovered they were going to get all the money from the federal government and they were taking all they could get&quot; and that they took the opportunity &quot;to screw us.&quot; In March 2010, Kanjorski supported and voted for the federal health care reform legislation. Later that year, Kanjorski was instrumental in the crafting of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, helping draft a considerable portion of this legislation. When the bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama in July 2010, Kanjorski appeared with fellow legislators by Obama&#x27;s side as the President signed the legislation.

One of Kanjorski&#x27;s final votes in Congress, merely weeks before his final term ended, was a vote against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, legislation signed into law by President Obama in December 2010. Kanjorski&#x27;s vote in opposition to the bill stemmed from his disenchantment with the fact that the legislation extended President George W. Bush&#x27;s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.

===2008 financial crisis===
In an interview on C-SPAN on January 27, 2009, Kanjorski defended the original emergency actions by the United States government to halt the 2008 financial crisis in September 2008. Kanjorski stated that the move to raise the guarantee money funds up to $250,000 was an emergency measure to stave off a massive money market &quot;electronic run&quot; on the banks that removed $550 billion from the system in a matter of hours on the morning of September 18. He further asserted that, if not stopped, the run would not only have caused the American economy to crash immediately, within 24 hours it would have brought down the world economy as well. On February 10, 2009, the financial writer Daniel Gross subsequently confirmed some elements of the story on &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, but he prefaced his remarks by saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know if his numbers are 100 percent correct&quot;. Felix Salmon of Condé Nast Portfolio also questioned why Kanjorski&#x27;s account had not been stated before.

==Political campaigns==
In 1980, Dan Flood, who had represented the 11th District for most of the time since 1945, resigned. Kanjorski ran in the crowded special election as an independent, finishing behind State Representative Ray Musto. He ran against Musto in the Democratic primary later that year, but finished third. Musto lost to Republican James L. Nelligan in the general election. In 1984, after sitting out the 1982 campaign, Kanjorski defeated incumbent Frank G. Harrison, who had defeated Nelligan in 1982, in the primary. He won the general election by a solid 17-point margin, even as Ronald Reagan carried the district in his landslide reelection bid.
In 1986, Kanjorski faced a younger, well-financed Republican opponent in Marc Holtzman. The race was initially seen as one of the hottest in the country. However, Kanjorski won by 41 points, his largest margin of victory in a contested election. He was unopposed in 1988 and 1990 and did not face another credible opponent until 2002, when he faced Lou Barletta, the mayor of Hazleton. Kanjorski defeated Barletta by 13 points. The margin would have likely been closer had the state legislature not shifted heavily Democratic Scranton and most of surrounding Lackawanna County from the nearby 10th District to the 11th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled legislature wanted to protect the 10th&#x27;s then-incumbent Republican, Don Sherwood, by packing the already heavily Democratic 11th with as many Democrats as possible. Scranton had anchored the 10th and its predecessors for almost a century—though since the turn of the 20th Century the 10th was represented more often by Republican representatives than Democratic representatives.

===2008===

After facing no major-party opposition in 2004 and a nominal Republican challenger in 2006, Kanjorski faced Lou Barletta again in 2008. Since the 2002 race, Barletta had become well known for his opposition to illegal immigration. In 2008, Fox News broadcast a segment accusing Kanjorski of obtaining $10 million in earmarks for a company run by his family.

Multiple polls had shown Kanjorski trailing by as many as five percentage points, and the race was pegged as one of the nation&#x27;s most competitive leading into the 2008 elections. Kanjorski was one of the few House Democrats in the Northeast in any danger of being unseated. However, Kanjorski won in a much more competitive race than his first matchup with Barletta, taking 52 percent of the vote to Barletta&#x27;s 48 percent, even as Barack Obama easily carried the district. Kanjorski lost three of the district&#x27;s five counties, including Luzerne County, where both he and Barletta live. However, as in 2002, Kanjorski swamped Barletta in Lackawanna County, winning by 12,500 votes (20 percent); he lost the area he had represented prior to the 2000 redistricting by almost 4,000 votes.

===2010===

Kanjorski won against Corey O&#x27;Brien and Brian Kelly in the May 2010 Democratic primary with 49.3% of the vote.

Barletta challenged Kanjorski again in 2010. This time, Barletta managed to defeat Kanjorski with 55 percent of the vote, largely due to winning Luzerne County by almost 10,000 votes. Kanjorski was dogged by some of the more incendiary comments he made during the campaign, such as his comments about Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott: &quot;Instead of running for governor of Florida, they ought to have him and shoot him. Put him against the wall and shoot him.&quot;

==Post-political career==
After leaving office, Kanjorski and his long-time chief of staff Karen Feather formed Kanjorski &amp; Associates, LLC, a public policy consulting firm.

Lowey&#x27;s district was numbered as the 20th from 1989 to 1993, as the 18th from 1993 to 2013, and as the beginning in 2013. The district includes many of New York City&#x27;s inner northern suburbs, such as White Plains, Purchase, Tarrytown, Mount Kisco, and Armonk. She was succeeded by fellow Democrat Mondaire Jones.

In 2018, Lowey became the first woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee. She announced on October 10, 2019, that she would retire and not run for re-election to Congress in 2020.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Lowey was born in the Bronx in New York City to Beatrice (Fleisher) and Jack Melnikoff. She graduated from the Bronx High School of Science as valedictorian of the class of 1955, and then from Mount Holyoke College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in liberal studies.

Lowey worked for Mario Cuomo&#x27;s 1974 campaign for lieutenant governor of New York. She then served as the assistant secretary of state of New York for 13 years.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

Lowey ran for the United States House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 20th congressional district in the 1988 election against incumbent Joe DioGuardi. She defeated DioGuardi. Her district was renumbered as the 18th district after the 1990 census and became the 17th after the 2010 census. For her entire tenure, Lowey represented a large slice of New York City&#x27;s northern suburbs, including most of Westchester County and all of Rockland County. She used to represent some of the far northern portions of Queens and the Bronx until redistricting after the 2000 Census removed the New York City portion of her district.

Lowey considered running for the United States Senate in 2000, but stepped aside when First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy. Lowey was considered a top contender for appointment to Clinton&#x27;s Senate seat after Clinton was nominated to be Secretary of State, but in a December 1, 2008, phone interview with the Associated Press, she stated that she was not interested in giving up her senior seat on the House Appropriations Committee.

In 2004, Lowey received 69% of the vote against political newcomer Richard A. Hoffman, a Wall Street investor and largely self-funded candidate who ran on a platform of opposing special interests and cutting federal taxes. Lowey emphasized her track record on homeland security issues, notably her work to reform the formula for distributing homeland security grants to states. In 2006, also against Hoffman, Lowey won with 70%. Lowey was re-elected to an eleventh term in 2008, with 68% of the vote against James C. Russell.

===Tenure===
Lowey received an &quot;A&quot; on the liberal Drum Major Institute&#x27;s 2005 scorecard. She received 12% on the Club for Growth&#x27;s 2007 congressional scorecard. According to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Lowey consistently votes in support of the policies of the Democratic Party, and is seen as a strong and effective progressive voice in that legislative body.

Her voting record on mass surveillance earned her a &quot;D&quot; on the Stand Against Spying Congressional Scorecard, which was created by a coalition of organizations and individuals from across the political spectrum advocating for transparency and an end to mass surveillance.

Early in her Congressional career, Lowey sponsored an earmark for the purpose of &quot;dredging the Mamaroneck Harbor.&quot; According to the local newspaper, &quot;The Journal News&quot;, the dredging was proposed because &quot;the harbor was becoming too shallow &#x27;to accommodate the larger yachts.&#x27;&quot;

In 2001–2002, Lowey served as the first female chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

One of the notable causes she supports is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in support of which she appeared at a congressional hearing accompanied by &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters Bert and Ernie.

Lowey has been a vocal advocate for a Security Council Resolution on the conflict in Darfur. She is responsible for the $500 million in the Emergency Spending Bill for Aid in Darfur.

Lowey voted for HR 2454, the &quot;Cap and Trade&quot; legislation.

In early 2009, Lowey introduced the Transportation Security Workforce Enhancement Act, which calls for collective bargaining rights for federal workers at the TSA and Department of Homeland Security. However, some statements from the TSA dispute the necessity of collective bargaining.

She was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009, Affordable Health Care for America Act. Because of the rancor and disruptions which marked many of the town hall meetings held in the summer of 2009 to discuss Health Care Reform, Lowey chose to present her point of view on Health Care Reform in a telephone conference call, the effectiveness of which was questioned by some of her constituents.

In 2018, the Democrats won the majority in the U.S House of Representatives and subsequently Congresswoman Lowey became the first Chairwoman of the House Committee on Appropriations. After she became chair, she negotiated a border security bill with Senator Richard Shelby that funded the government through 2020.

On October 10, 2019, two months after Democrat Mondaire Jones announced his intention to challenge her in a 2020 primary, Lowey announced she would not run for reelection in 2020.

For her tenure as the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee in the 116th Congress, Lowey earned an &quot;A&quot; grade from the non-partisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

====Iran deal====
Lowey announced her opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran, stating that

In my judgment, sufficient safeguards are not in place to address the risks associated with the agreement. Relieving UN sanctions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles and releasing billions of dollars to the Iranian regime could lead to a dangerous regional weapons race and enable Iran to bolster its funding of terrorists. The deal does not explicitly require Iran to fully disclose its previous military work to the IAEA&#x27;s satisfaction before sanctions relief is provided, and inspectors will not have immediate access to the most suspicious facilities. There are no clear accountability measures regarding punishment for minor violations, which could encourage Iran to cheat.

=== 2016 DNC superdelegate ===
Like all Democratic members of Congress, Lowey was a superdelegate to the 2016, Democratic National Convention, pledged to support Hillary Clinton. Lowey&#x27;s chief of staff, when asked by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; whether Lowey might switch her support to candidate Bernie Sanders if Sanders were to win the New York State Democratic presidential primary, said &quot;absolutely not... Hillary Clinton is Congresswoman Lowey&#x27;s friend, colleague and her constituent, and she is behind her 100%.&quot;

===Committee assignments (116th Congress)===
* Committee on Appropriations (Chairwoman)
** Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (Chairwoman)
** As Chairwoman of the full committee, Lowey may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Women&#x27;s Caucus
* House Pro-Choice Caucus
* Hudson River Caucus
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* Israel Allies Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* National Eating Disorders Awareness Caucus
* Congressional Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Caucus
* Afterschool Caucuses

==Personal life==
Lowey is married to Stephen Lowey, a named partner in the law firm of Lowey Dannenberg Cohen &amp; Hart, P.C., which is located in White Plains, New York. According to the West Corporation, his practice areas include securities law, antitrust law, and consumer protection. They have three children and eight grandchildren, including &quot;Forever Summer: Hamptons&quot; cast member Ilan Luttway. The estimate of Lowey&#x27;s personal assets, based on financial disclosures members of Congress are required to provide (aside from that of personal residences and non-interest-bearing bank accounts), put her wealth at $41.2 million in 2010, based largely on her husband&#x27;s investments. This figure is derived from a special investigative series of asset wealth of all U.S. Congressional Representatives conducted by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Lowey is Jewish.

<doc id="963533" wikidata="Q1423410" url="?curid=963533" title="Varna Airport">
<text>Varna Airport () is the airport of Varna, the historical maritime capital of Bulgaria. Varna Airport is the third largest airport in Bulgaria. It is located 10 kilometers from the center of Varna near the town of Aksakovo. The airport serves Varna, Golden Sands and northeastern Bulgaria. The busiest season for the airport is from the end of May to the beginning of October.

==History==
In 2013, a new passenger terminal [Terminal 2] opened and the Terminal 1 constructed In 1972 permanently closed while Terminal 3 opened in 2007, so Varna Airport had only 1 terminal before 2007.

There are domestic and international flights from Varna to about 70 destinations in 25 countries, with Bulgarian and foreign airlines. The airport is close to the Port of Varna and the railway system. The airport has one asphalt-covered runway 09/27 with ILS CAT I system on 09 edge and a parking apron for 24 aircraft.
In June 2006 the Bulgarian Government awarded &quot;Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide&quot; a 40-year-long concession on both Varna and Burgas airports in return for investments exceeding €500 million, including a new passenger terminal by 2008.

From 15 October 2011 until 28 February 2012, Varna airport was closed for a reconstruction of the runway. All flights were operated to/from Burgas Airport.

In 2016 the airport handled 1,689,595 passengers - a 20.8% increase compared to 2015.

On June 16, 2023 at Varna Airport, &quot;Fraport Twin Star Airport Management&quot; AD officially opened the completely renewed Taxiway (ECHO).

==Terminals==
The airport has three terminals: Terminal 1, built in 1972 (closed), Terminal 3 (opened in June 2007), which was used during the summer season, and the new Terminal 2, opened in August 2013.

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 (closed) was extended several times over the years. The departures area had 21 check-in counters and six security checkpoints. In the terminal there were various outlets: cafes, fast food restaurants, currency exchange, and duty-free shops. There were ten boarding gates. The arrivals area had two luggage belts, as well as currency exchange and a tax-free shop. Terminal 1 still has a VIP room and business lounge. In 2010, the VIP room was renovated. As of 2014, all flights, including no-frills, are handled at Terminal 2. Hence, the old terminal is closed except the VIP area.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 started operations on 18 August 2013. In December 2011 the construction work on the new Terminal 2 began. T2 has a capacity of 1,800,000 passengers per year and 25 check-in desks. It covers an area of 18,000 square metres. T2&#x27;s buildings are designed so that their capacity can be increased as an extension to the existing architectural part. The first passenger service on T2 was a domestic flight to Sofia operated by the national carrier Bulgaria Air and first international passengers served were on a Belavia flight from Minsk. T2 was designed by London-based architecture firm Pascall+Watson. 

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Varna Airport:

==Ground transport==

Bus line 409 connects the airport with Varna city center and resorts nearby (route: &quot;Varna Airport – Mall Varna – Varna Bus Station / Grand Mall – City Center – Saints Constantine and Helena - Golden Sands&quot;).

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 7 March 1983, Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Flight 013 was hijacked by four men armed with knives. While they demanded to be taken to Vienna, the pilots tricked the hijackers by landing in Varna. Security forces stormed the plane, arresting three hijackers and killing one hijacker who was threatening the flight attendant.
* On 5 June 1992, Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Tupolev 154B overran runway 27 in bad weather conditions. There were no casualties, but the plane was written off.
* On 24 May 2013, Air VIA flight 502 from Leipzig/Halle to Varna overran runway 09 at Varna Airport after touchdown. Two passengers were injured during evacuation.
* On July 8, 2014, Lars Mittank, a German vacationing in Golden Sands, mysteriously disappeared near Varna Airport. Mittank had been alone in Bulgaria the previous two days and reported to be behaving strangely, and was last seen on security cameras fleeing from the airport into the surrounding forest.

<doc id="963534" wikidata="Q844523" url="?curid=963534" title="Flags of the World (website)">
<text>Flags of the World (abbreviated FOTW or FotW) is an Internet-based vexillological association and resource, dealing with both modern and historic flags. Beginning as a Yahoo Group, in 1993, the website was established in 1995 by Giuseppe Bottasini, a computer engineer from Milan. It became a member of the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (FIAV) in 2001. Readers submit contributions via a mailing list. It has been called the most all-encompassing flag databases on the web, with over 19,000 pages by mid 2003.

Flags of the World renders most of its images of flags in the GIF format, with a standardized and limited colour palette. A standard height of 216 pixels is used, a number chosen to make division into many different numbers of stripes possible, although other close pixels heights can sometimes be used.

The site has come under criticism for both the quality of its images and a perceived lack of reliability.

Flags of the World also maintains the &quot;Dictionary of Vexillology&quot; a glossary of English language flag terms. This was started in 2005 by Andreis Petrus
Burgers, Terence Martin and Christopher Southworth. It has been criticized for including words of its own formulation, such as the term &quot;archivexillum&quot; which was coined by the editors of Flags of the World themselves in 2010.

The organization&#x27;s flag was designed by Mark Sensents, with its symbolism described as follows: &quot;White on the hoist stands for peace, blue on the fly for progress. The six colours of the stars are the main colours used in flags. The stars help to make one bigger symbol. The way the stars are all connected to each other represents the Internet.&quot;

<text>Gloucester Rugby are a professional rugby union club based in the West Country city of Gloucester, England. They play in Premiership Rugby, England&#x27;s top division of rugby.

The club was formed in 1873 and since 1891 has played its home matches at Kingsholm Stadium in the north of the city. In the 2023–24 Premiership Rugby season, Gloucester finished 9th which earned them a space in the 2024–25 EPCR Challenge Cup. The current director of rugby (DOR) is George Skivington who took the role of head coach in the summer of 2020 before being promoted to DOR in the Autumn of 2023.

Gloucester have won 8 major titles; four RFU Knockout Cup&#x27;s in 1971–72, 1977–78, 1981–82 and 2002–03, one Anglo-Welsh Cup win in 2010–11, and one Premiership Rugby Cup win in 2023–24. The Premiership Rugby Cup win in 2024 meant they became the first club to win all three iterations of the English domestic cup competition. Outside of England, Gloucester has also seen success in Europe&#x27;s second-tier completion having won the EPCR Challenge Cup twice: in 2005–06 and 2014–15. Despite never winning a league title, Gloucester have finished runners-up on four occasions; 1988–89, 1989–90, 2002–03, and most recently in 2006–07.

The club has no official nickname but is referred to as the Cherry and Whites by supporters and the media in reference to the Cherry and white hooped shirts worn by the team. Matches with local rivals Bath and Bristol Bears are referred to as West Country derbies.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
The club was formed in 1873 after a meeting at the Spread Eagle Hotel with the announcement in the Gloucester Journal: &quot;A football club (as rugby was then called) has been formed in this city – the season&#x27;s operations begin at the Spa on the first Tuesday in next month.&quot; a team was then organised to play the college school, which was actually played on the current Kingsholm ground.

The club left the Spa after an argument with the cricket club that they were ground sharing with. During the winter, the Rugby Club had used a salt mixture to remove frost from the pitch, resulting in the death of the grass on the wicket. Gloucester were no longer welcome at the Spa ground. They then acquired lands from the Castle Grim Estate for £4,000 in 1891 &amp; have played home fixtures at this site ever since, in the area known as Kingsholm.

===Continued successes and the dawn of professionalism===
In 1972, Gloucester RFC won the first-ever National Knock-Out Competition. Having beaten Bath, Bristol, London Welsh and Coventry (all away from home) in earlier rounds, they beat Moseley in a Twickenham final that was marred by violence and the sending off of Moseley&#x27;s Nigel Horton.

In 1978, Gloucester RFC won the first ever John Player Cup, defeating Leicester Tigers in another final noted for violent play both on and off the pitch at Twickenham Stadium.

Despite the two cup wins of the 1970s, and a shared trophy in 1982, Gloucester were soon to find themselves in the shadow of Bath, the rising force from down the A46.

In 1989, Gloucester came close to winning the &#x27;double&#x27; but failed to win either competition, losing to Wasps for the league title and losing the cup final 48–6 to Bath.

Professionalism finally came in 1995, but Gloucester was without a major investor, and lost ground in terms of player recruitment and revenue acquisition. But this did not prevent the club from transforming itself into a limited company.

===The early professional era===
Tom Walkinshaw bought the club in 1997. After two full seasons at the helm, Richard Hill was replaced as director of rugby by former France captain Philippe Saint-André.

In 1999–2000, a third-place finish took Gloucester into the Heineken Cup. With Phil Vickery, Trevor Woodman, Kingsley Jones and former All Black Ian Jones forming the basis of a formidable pack, Gloucester reached the semi-finals.

In 2003, Gloucester won their first cup in 25 years, under new coach Nigel Melville.

During the 2002–03 season, Gloucester finished the league in first place, 15 points ahead of the next best club. Under the new Premiership playoff system, Gloucester were required to play a single knock-out match to determine the Premiership champions. Despite a significant rest period of three weeks, Gloucester lost the final to Wasps and have thus never been crowned English domestic champions. Melville left the club and was replaced by Dean Ryan for the 2005–06 season.

At the start of the 2005 season, owner Tom Walkinshaw made several changes to modernise the club. &#x27;Gloucester Rugby Football Club&#x27; was renamed &#x27;Gloucester Rugby&#x27; and, due to copyright issues, no longer used the City Coat of Arms as the club&#x27;s crest (as the crest didn&#x27;t belong to the club, so unofficial merchandise was freely available).

The 2005–06 season saw an improvement in the club&#x27;s fortunes, although they did not qualify for the play-offs, they were strong contenders and lost out on the last day of the regular season. They also won silverware in the European Challenge Cup, defeating London Irish in a final that went into extra time.

Gloucester finished 1st in the 2006–07 Premiership table. Both Leicester and Gloucester tied with 71 points, but Gloucester gained first place with more games won. Gloucester defeated Saracens in the semi-final at Kingsholm, 50–9, and faced Leicester Tigers in the final. Gloucester lost 44–16.

===2008–present===
Martin St Quinton, an office equipment and telecoms entrepreneur acquired 25% of the club in 2008, and became vice chairman, with a focus on increasing sponsorship and other non-playing related areas.

Gloucester Rugby began the 2007–08 Guinness Premiership campaign as favourites, and came top of the league to book a place in the play-off semi-final at Kingsholm. Leicester Tigers won the match 25–26, marking Gloucester&#x27;s third Premiership play-off defeat.

Gloucester reached the EDF Energy Cup Final in the 2008–09 season, losing to Cardiff at Twickenham.

On 11 June 2009, Dean Ryan left Gloucester by mutual consent and was replaced by Bryan Redpath as their new head coach.

Tragedy struck the club on 12 December 2010, when popular club owner Tom Walkinshaw died from cancer at the age of 64. David McKnight was appointed non-executive chairman in April 2011, who guided Tom&#x27;s son Ryan, who inherited the club. A memorial service held at Gloucester Cathedral for Tom was attended by hundreds of fans.

Gloucester won the Anglo-Welsh cup in the 2010–11 season, beating Newcastle Falcons 34–7 in the final at Franklins&#x27; Gardens. They also made the Premiership play-offs this season, losing in the Semi-final to Saracens at Vicarage Road.

On 17 April 2012, Bryan Redpath announced his resignation as Gloucester head coach with immediate effect, months before the end of the 2011–12 season. In June 2012, Gloucester announced former Scarlets coach Nigel Davies as their new director of rugby.

On 13 November 2012, Gloucester hosted an International match against Fiji as part of the 2012 Autumn Internationals. The match was held at Kingsholm Stadium and Gloucester won 31–29. On 12 November 2013, Gloucester hosted an International match against Japan, as part of the 2013 Autumn Internationals. Gloucester won 40–5.

After two poor seasons towards the end of the 2013–14 season, Nigel Davies departed Gloucester with immediate effect. On 7 June 2014, Gloucester appointed David Humphreys as their new director of rugby, with Brumbies coach Laurie Fisher confirmed as their head coach as of July 2014. During the 2014–15 season, Gloucester won the European Rugby Challenge Cup at Twickenham Stoop, beating Edinburgh 19–13 in the final.

In 2016, Martin St Quinton acquired 100% full ownership of the club to become the new chairman of Gloucester Rugby with immediate effect.

On 6 March 2017, Laurie Fisher left Gloucester by mutual consent before the end of the 2016–17 season. On 3 April 2017, he was replaced by Lions coach Johan Ackermann as Gloucester&#x27;s new head coach. During the 2016–17 season, Gloucester reach the final of the European Rugby Challenge Cup, losing 17–25 to Stade Francais at Murrayfield. During the 2017–18 season, Gloucester reach the final of the European Rugby Challenge Cup, marking three European finals in four seasons, but lost to Cardiff 31–30 at San Mames Stadium, Bilbao.

On 15 May 2020, Johan Ackermann announced his departure from Gloucester to become the new head coach at NTT DoCoMo Red Hurricanes based in Japan. On 2 June 2020, David Humphreys announced he will leave Gloucester after six seasons as their director of rugby, a month after Ackermann&#x27;s departure.

On 27 June 2020, Gloucester announced London Irish Forwards Coach George Skivington as their new head coach, with Alex Brown promoted to the position of Chief Operating Officer. This meant Skivington would handle the playing side of his new job whilst Brown focused on rugby related matters like recruitment and regulatory issues at Gloucester.

In July 2023, Brown was appointed interim CEO following the resignation of Lance Bradley. In September 2023, the club announced a number of promotions after a board meeting in August, Brown was appointment CEO following the interim period and Skivington promoted to Director of Rugby meaning he will have responsibility over the entire playing department with no effect to his role as head coach.

==Women&#x27;s team==

In 2014, Gloucester Rugby and Hartpury College came together to found Gloucester-Hartpury Women&#x27;s Rugby Football Club. They are run under the jurisdiction of Gloucester Rugby. The CEO is former Gloucester player James Forrester. Gloucester-Hartpury have won the 2016–17 season of the Women&#x27;s Championship Midlands 2 as well as the 2022–23 season of the Premier 15s, with the latter being the highest level of women&#x27;s rugby union in England.

==Stadium==

Gloucester Rugby plays home matches at Kingsholm Stadium. The club left the Spa Ground for Kingsholm when it bought an area of the Castle Grim Estate for £4,000 in 1891. In that year, Gloucester Rugby Football Club opened the &quot;Sixpenny&quot; stand, which later became known as the Shed.

Kingsholm&#x27;s capacity was further increased to 20,000 in 1926 when a grandstand was added to the stadium at a cost of £2,500, containing 1,750 seats. However, six years later, it was destroyed by fire. There were plans proposed to increase the seating capacity of the stadium to 7,000. However, it remained a proposal, although the grandstand was replaced, terracing in the Sixpenny, and at the Tummp end was preferred, and indeed, more affordable in the early 20th century.

Like the clubs of the Welsh mining valleys, Gloucester Rugby traditionally drew its support and its playing strength from local working-class communities. The Shed, so-called because it looks like a cow shed, became known as such in the 1950s. Gloucester Rugby&#x27;s fanzine, &#x27;Shed Head&#x27; refers to it as &#x27;the cauldron of fear&#x27;. The Shed is a standing-only terracing that runs continuously down one touchline, opposite the point where visiting teams emerge from the dressing rooms. Its low tin roof amplifies the effect of passionate support which has been mentioned by commentators sitting above it during live broadcasts. This, together with a historically good home record, contributes to the ground also being nicknamed &#x27;Castle Grim&#x27;.

In October 2003, Gloucester Rugby launched &#x27;Project Kingsholm&#x27;. &#x27;The Kingsholm Supporters Mutual&#x27; (KSM) was set up by Gloucester Rugby Football Club in October 2003, to help fundraise towards &#x27;Project Kingsholm&#x27;, the redevelopment of Gloucester&#x27;s entire ground at a cost of £6,000,000, and the launch of a supporters shares rights issue. The idea was to be similar to the development at Franklins Gardens, home of Northampton Saints RFC, although on a bigger scale, incorporating both seating and terracing. Despite the KSM meeting the fundraising targets, Gloucester Rugby abandoned all plans.

In 2006, the club announced it would be making an extension to Kingsholm, bringing the stadium capacity up to 16,500. This was mainly to comply with Premier Rugby&#x27;s minimum seat number requirements. The old main Grandstand (which was both terracing and seating) was later replaced by a new all seater structure, while terracing on the Worcester Street end of the ground was developed into an all seater stand, known as the &#x27;Buildbase&#x27; stand at the time.

In January 2007, the club announced plans to redevelop The Shed terracing to all seater. This was intended to enable the entire stadium to become all-seating. A large number of supporters did not want to see this happen under the proposals put forward by Gloucester Rugby, and a poster campaign under the name of &#x27;Save Our Shed&#x27; or &#x27;SOS&#x27; was initiated by the Gloucester Citizen newspaper. Posters were held up by supporters standing in the Shed, on camera during a televised Heineken Cup match against Leinster at Kingsholm. T-shirts were also made independently by supporters, with the slogan &#x27;Save Our Shed&#x27; printed on them. The campaign did not protest the redevelopment of the Shed, rather the plans put forward at the time, which were to replace all terracing with seats, leaving no alternative anywhere in the ground, despite such a large demand for terracing.

In September 2008, chairman Tom Walkinshaw confirmed there were plans for the Shed to be redeveloped, but it would remain as a terrace (with an increased capacity of 6,000), with hospitality units above it. However, as of the 2010–11 season, the need and desire for redeveloping the Shed decreased with the above-mentioned plans proving to be conjecture, and as such abandoned, have never come into effect and do not appear to for the foreseeable future.

2007 also saw the club reject the proposal of a new 20,000 all seater stadium in an area of the city nicknamed &#x27;The Railway Triangle&#x27;. This was intended to be shared with the local football side. Kingsholm was also suggested in October 2007 as a possible temporary home for Gloucester City after their stadium Meadow Park was flooded and then abandoned following the summer floods. This move was, however, rejected by Gloucester Rugby Chairman, Tom Walkinshaw.

In 2017, Gloucester Rugby announced that the Kingsholm Stadium will include a megastore and even museum.

==Colours==

According to local legend, it was decided that the club&#x27;s colour was to be entirely navy blue, yet on an away trip they realised they had forgotten to bring sufficient Navy strip for the entire team. Travelling en route via Painswick, they stopped off at the local rugby club and asked to borrow a strip. Painswick RFC loaned them 15 of their cherry-and-white jerseys, the Gloucester side went on to win the away fixture and failed to return the shirts to Painswick, adopting the colours as their own. In 2003, to celebrate Gloucester RFC&#x27;s 130th anniversary, Gloucester RFC returned the favour and donated Painswick RFC an entire new set of first team colours. Painswick RFC refer to themselves as &quot;The Original Cherry and Whites&quot; in reference to the incident.

For the start of the 2000–01 season, the club introduced new shirts which no longer featured the cherry-and-white hoops, instead featuring a largely red shirt with white sleeves.

The hoops returned in the 2001–02 season, with thin white hoops. In the 2005–06 season, the club moved away from traditional hoops again. The New Jersey was predominantly red, with white panelling on the side in a &#x27;ladder&#x27; effect. This was dubbed the &#x27;Spiderman&#x27; or &#x27;Arsenal&#x27; kit by supporters. The new kit also abandoned the traditional navy blue shorts and socks, with the new design becoming all red. On the release of the 2005–06 shirt there was a degree of disappointment in Gloucester Rugby&#x27;s decision to move away from the hooped jersey again (a design generally associated with traditional rugby shirts), as this was a dramatic move away from the classic Gloucester Rugby design. After the new 2005–06 shirt was released, &#x27;Hudsons &amp; Co&#x27; of Gloucester city centre, released a classic, plain cherry-and-white-hooped Gloucester Rugby jersey, manufactured by Cotton Traders (who supplied Gloucester Rugby jerseys prior to the 2007–08 season, when the manufacture of kit was taken over by RugbyTech), albeit an unofficial jersey which is not associated with the club, the shirt proved popular with fans unhappy with the official shirt. On the back of this success, many of the Public Houses in the Kingsholm area also began selling shirts with the classic hoops. Although these shirts do not display the name &#x27;Gloucester Rugby&#x27;, due to copyright, the Hudson variety were labelled &#x27;Gloucester Rugby Football Club&#x27; while the pub versions used the title &#x27;Cherry and Whites&#x27;. Both designs used the traditional cherry-and-white hoops, with the title under the Gloucester city coat of arms. As such many of the fans who disapproved of the new original design were able to purchase this classic design instead.

A number of fans commented on the irony that, whilst the new crest and shirt design were originally designed in order to prevent unofficial merchandise, they have in fact increased the number of fans turning to unofficial shirts. Gloucester Rugby released its own, official, supporters shirt displaying the classic hooped design with the new club crest above the date of the club&#x27;s inception &#x27;1873&#x27;. For the start of the 2009–10 season, the club returned the first team jersey design to the cherry-and-white hoops.

In 2018, Gloucester revealed a new logo.

==Kits==
For many years, Cotton Oxford and Cotton Traders provided the playing kits for Gloucester. Between the 2007–08 and the 2010–11 seasons, RugbyTech supplied their kits, and between the 2011–12 season and the 2015-16 Kooga supplied the kits. Australian kit manufacturer XBlades were the provider, between the 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons. From the 2019–20 season onwards Oxen Sports supplied the kit.

As of the 2024–25 season, BiGDUG, a Gloucester-based shelving company are the front-of-shirt sponsor. Hartpury appears on each shoulder. Kärcher feature on the lower back of the shirt as well as on the back of the playing shorts. For the European shirt, Malvern Tyres replace BiGDUG as the front-of-shirt sponsor.

In February 2023, Gloucester announced that for the first Slater Cup game held at Kingsholm that they would play in a limited edition Slater Cup shirt. The club also announced that £10 from every shirt sold would go directly to the Slater family to aid Ed&#x27;s treatment, and adaptations to his home and provide valuable financial support to his family following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease in July 2022.

The shirt was designed by Ed and his family, and contains touches such as &#x27;4Dad&#x27; above the club logo, while the classic cherries of the &#x27;Cherry &amp; Whites&#x27; also appear on the bottom of the shirt. The Slater Cup trophy is on the left sleeve, while a portrait of Ed appears on the right. The classic Gloucester Rugby red remains as the core colour of the new strip, with the number 4, Ed&#x27;s position, placed on the front. It was used in Slater Cup fixtures for two seasons.

==Nickname==
Gloucester are referred to by fans and media alike as the Cherry and Whites, a reference to the club&#x27;s colours. Although this is not an official nickname, the club themselves regularly use the nickname in marketing and community messaging, as well as the players through social media. In the early 2010s, the club released an official fan shirt with imagery of cherries and the city&#x27;s Cathedral on. The history of this nickname being used can be traced to local media references in the 1920s, when the nickname the &quot;Red and Whites&quot; was used, before evolving into the now familiar &quot;Cherry and Whites&quot; nickname during the 1950s/60s.

In 2005, the club decided to abandon its &quot;Cherry and Whites&quot; nickname and changed themselves to Lions instead but no official change was made during the year.

Another unofficial nickname for the club was &quot;The Elver Eaters&#x27;, although that name is a distant memory mused over by the club&#x27;s oldest and longest supporters.

<doc id="963543" wikidata="Q73533" url="?curid=963543" title="Longomontanus (crater)">
<text>Longomontanus is an ancient lunar impact crater located in the rugged southern highlands to the southwest of the bright ray crater Tycho. Longomontanus is of the variety of large lunar formations called a &quot;walled plain&quot;, although it is actually more of a circular depression in the surface.

Because of its location, Longomontanus appears distinctly oval in shape due to foreshortening. To the southeast of Longomontanus is the even larger formation Clavius, and to the east is Maginus. North of the rim is the irregular crater Montanari, which in turn is joined at its northern rim by Wilhelm.

The wall of Longomontanus is heavily worn and incised by past impacts, and the rim is essentially level with the surrounding terrain. The northern rim especially is impacted with multiple overlapping craterlets. To the east of the rim is a semi-circular ridge that has the appearance of an overlapped crater rim. The crater floor of Longomontanus is relatively flat, with a low cluster of central peaks somewhat offset to the west.

Longomontanus is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Longomontanus.

<doc id="963555" wikidata="Q861222" url="?curid=963555" title="Chris Sawyer's Locomotion">
<text>Chris Sawyer&#x27;s Locomotion (often abbreviated to Locomotion) is a video game designed and programmed by independent game developer Chris Sawyer, and published by Atari Interactive in September 2004. The game is a simulation game in which the player takes on the role of a transportation company manager, building transportation networks and managing the flow of goods and passengers in order to compete against rival companies. Sawyer independently developed the game over nine years from the 1990s as a &quot;spiritual successor to &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;&quot;, with the game featuring &quot;fundamentally the same&quot; gameplay but with &quot;differences in detail, scale and presentation&quot; to update and refine the features that Sawyer &quot;wanted to get right&quot; in its predecessor.

&quot;Locomotion&quot; was released to mixed reviews, with critics observing the game had a dated presentation for the time and was less user-friendly than its predecessors. Following an extended hiatus from the video game industry, the game was re-released by Sawyer in 2013 as a mobile iteration of &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; for Android and iOS. &quot;Locomotion&quot; has also since been the subject of open-source redevelopment by third parties.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Locomotion&quot; is an isometric transport simulation game using a refined version of the &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; engine first used for &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;. The game involves the management of a transport company to construct a network of trains, trams, trucks, buses, airplanes, and ships to co-ordinate a supply chain of resources, including minerals, goods, and passengers across industries to towns and cities. Players start with a bank loan and must build profitable networks to facilitate the supply and demand of resources to earn money and expand their company. To transport resources, players build networks between stations using road, rail, ports, and airports, and purchase vehicles of varying cost, speed, and reliability to travel between them. Players create profitable networks by transporting goods and passengers in efficient networks across greater distances, whilst minimizing transport costs.

&quot;Locomotion&quot; contains over 40 scenarios in which players compete with rival companies to create successful networks and meet various objectives, such as finishing in a certain ranking in the list of companies, or transporting a specific amount of cargo of a resource. Scenarios are based on five difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Challenging and Expert, and are based on fictional and real-world locations, including the United States, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The game also contains a scenario editor to allow players to create and modify the game&#x27;s scenarios and create custom maps. Scenarios in &quot;Locomotion&quot; also supports online multiplayer for two players, which plays identically to single player scenarios except with minor restrictions to speed controls. The game also features a hidden train driving mode in which players can perform a keyboard command to assume control over the trains in the game.

== Development and release ==

&quot;Locomotion&quot; was developed by game developer Chris Sawyer, who had previously developed the simulation game &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;&quot;. Sawyer intended &quot;Locomotion&quot; to be a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, and had worked to complete such a game as early as 1996, but did not make a serious effort to create a successor until the release of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot; in 2002. Sawyer also cited the desire to modernise &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; to harness the increased technical capabilities of computers at the time, including greater processing power and memory, that allowed a game that &quot;could handle many more more transport vehicles, larger maps, and multiple-level bridges and tunnels instead of just land-based construction,&quot; and &quot;more detailed and smoother animation as well as the multi-level three-dimensional transport routes I wanted to include in previous games.&quot; Sawyer created the game independently, responsible for the &quot;design, programming, project management and research&quot; himself, with assistance from a graphic artist and musician. Sawyer reflected that &quot;Locomotion&quot; was created using &quot;large parts of the programming&quot; for &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;, which was developed during the same time. 

&quot;Locomotion&quot; was released in September 2004, following a preview by Atari at &quot;E3&quot; in May of that year. The game is the only title released by Sawyer to use his name in the title of the game. Sawyer stated that the use of his name in the title of &quot;Locomotion&quot; was used to address &quot;possible legal issues with using the name on its own...which also suited the PR people as they felt it might make it easier to promote the game having my name prominently displayed.&quot; Sawyer stated that &quot;Locomotion&quot; was the game he was &quot;most proud of&quot; creating, assessing the game as &quot;the best-written piece of programming I&#x27;ve ever done,&quot; citing the plug-in and multiplayer capabilities of the game. 

Following an extended hiatus from development, in 2013, Sawyer released an Android and iOS version of &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, with the game&#x27;s graphics and primarily based on the design of &quot;Locomotion&quot;. Sawyer expressed the desire to make the game based on the tactical challenge of running the game on a mobile device, stating &quot;the tactile nature of interactive isometric simulation-strategy games really suits the touch screen interface.&quot; On March 17, 2015, &quot;Locomotion&quot; was re-released through digital distribution on Steam and gog.com.

==Reception==

Reviews of &quot;Locomotion&quot; were generally mixed, with review aggregator &quot;Metacritic&quot; stating reviews were &quot;mixed or average&quot; with an average rating of 59%. Many critics compared the game unfavorably to its predecessors, &quot;Rollercoaster Tycoon&quot; and &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, with minimal improvements to the presentation, game mechanics and user interface. Indicative of this reception was Dan Adams of &quot;IGN&quot;, who stated &quot;Chris Sawyer released Transport Tycoon back in 1994. This game is the same game, but worse for the fact that it hasn&#x27;t evolved into anything better in a full ten years and that other transport and industry games have come out that have been a thousand times better than it for the fact that they had functional interfaces that provided information and easy construction.&quot; 

Several critics expressed that &quot;Locomotion&#x27;s&quot; visual presentation was dated at the time of release. Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, Dan Adams stated that the game suffered from a &quot;severe lack of artistic direction&quot;, stating &quot;buildings and towns are depressingly simple and boring, there&#x27;s no blending of texture terrains, and very little detail.&quot; Allen Rausch of &quot;GameSpy&quot; critiqued the game&#x27;s visuals as &quot;remarkably unattractive&quot;, critiquing the game&#x27;s &quot;boxy pseudo-modern architecture (as) just plain boring to look at.&quot; Many critics unfavorably compared the game&#x27;s visual presentation to its predecessors, with &quot;PC Zone&quot; stating the game had &quot;the same look and identical interface to that from &quot;Rollercoaster Tycoon&quot;, but here the colours appear drab, the maps flatter and some of the tiles don&#x27;t appear to connect all that well.&quot; Sawyer himself observed that the release received a &quot;quiet start&quot; in acceptance that the game did not &quot;have the flashy 3D graphics of most modern games&quot;, speculating that &quot;it’s much easier to advertise and promote something good looking rather than something which plays well.&quot; 

Critics also identified the game&#x27;s interface and navigation as a hindrance to gameplay. Writing for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, Di Luo stated the game&#x27;s presentation was &quot;cumbersome&quot;, observing that the game&#x27;s &quot;map rotation isn&#x27;t effective enough to let you see everything...finding the correct sources of and destinations for raw materials can be infuriatingly difficult.&quot; Dan Adams of &quot;IGN&quot; described the game as an &quot;exercise in frustration, (with) a frustration informational interface (and) frustrating construction interface&quot;, stating &quot;sorting through (maps) and finding the information you want can be a chore&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s really difficult to judge where tracks and roads need to go to connect.&quot; Jason Ocampo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated construction was largely &quot;trial and error&quot; and a &quot;frustrating experience...mainly due to the fact that you can&#x27;t completely undo the mistakes you&#x27;ll often make.&quot;

=== Retrospective reception ===

Retrospective assessments of &quot;Locomotion&quot; have been more forgiving than contemporary reviews, whilst noting the game was a disappointment. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; stated that the game was &quot;the most complete version of &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, even if it wasn&#x27;t named as such. It wasn&#x27;t as well received...with most complaints surrounding the UI, but a heap of improvements made for a solid addition to the concept all the same.&quot; In a retrospective of the &quot;Tycoon&quot; series of games developed by Sawyer, Connor Christie of &quot;Pocket Tactics&quot; stated &quot;&quot;Locomotion&quot; didn&#x27;t prove to be the reinvigoration of the &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; Sawyer was hoping for.&quot; Owen Faraday of &quot;Wired&quot; similarly stated the game &quot;drew a tepid reception from critics and fans alike, perhaps a sign that Sawyer&#x27;s full attention couldn&#x27;t be brought to bear on the (game).&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Locomotion&quot; was Sawyer&#x27;s final game for some time. Sawyer was in legal dispute with Atari from 2005 to 2008 over unpaid royalties for his work. This dispute, and the poor reception for &quot;Locomotion&quot; led him to depart the industry for a decade. He later returned to work on mobile ports of his earlier work.

=== &quot;OpenLoco&quot; ===

In January 2018, the open-source project &quot;OpenLoco&quot; was launched to enhance the gameplay of &quot;Locomotion&quot;. The project was founded by a group of developers from &quot;OpenRCT2&quot;, a similar open source reimplementation of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;. The &quot;OpenLoco&quot; team aimed to fix bugs, translate the game to more languages, support custom resolutions including 4K, and operating systems such as macOS and Linux. The project also sought to minimise limitations in the original game and give greater options for gameplay features, such as disabling vehicle breakdowns and unlocking building options. By 2021 &quot;OpenLoco&quot; was &quot;getting into a pretty good state&quot; according to &quot;Gaming on Linux&quot;, with multiplayer support in development. The project was praised by &quot;Game Pressure&quot; in 2024, which described it as an &quot;unofficial remaster&quot;.

<doc id="963556" wikidata="Q1149835" url="?curid=963556" title="Harlequin F.C.">
<text>Harlequins (officially Harlequin Football Club) are a professional rugby union club that plays in Premiership Rugby, the top level of English rugby union. Their home ground is the Twickenham Stoop, located in Twickenham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

The club, which was founded in 1866 as &quot;Hampstead Football Club&quot;, split the following year with some of the membership forming Wasps RFC. Three years later Hampstead renamed itself Harlequins and became one of the founding members of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. For more than a hundred years, Harlequins had been one of the top UK teams during the amateur era and this continued with the introduction of professionalism in 1995. The club has been champions of England twice, winning the title in 2012 and most recently in 2021. They won the European Challenge Cup in 2001, 2004 and 2011, the joint most wins of any team in the competition, and the domestic cup in 1988, 1991 and 2013. It remains the only founding club member of the RFU to still be in the top flight of English rugby.

Harlequins has the largest social media following of any club in the Premiership, the 2nd largest of any club in Europe, after Stade Toulousain, and is comfortably within the Top 10 of any club in the world.

The current club captain is Alex Dombrandt, with Billy Millard Director of Rugby for the 2024–25 season.

==History==

===Formation and early years===

The Hampstead Football Club was founded in 1866 and the first recorded game took place in 1867. A disagreement between Club Secretary William Titchener and William Alford in 1867 resulted in Alford leaving with half of the membership to form the club now known as Wasps. The club was renamed Harlequin Rugby Football Club in 1870, supposedly because the membership was no longer purely local and to retain the previously created &quot;HFC&quot; monogram mark. The word &#x27;Harlequin&#x27; (&quot;Arlecchino&quot;, a comic servant from the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;) was found in a dictionary and all present agreed to the new name.

During its first 40 years the club played at a total of 15 venues. Since 1909, they have only played at three.

In 1906, the club was invited by the Rugby Football Union to use the new national stadium in Twickenham. In those early days, only one or two internationals were played there during the season, and before long Twickenham became the headquarters of the Harlequin Football Club.

===1961, first East Africa tour===

In 1961, Harlequins undertook a tour of East Africa in conjunction with Pretoria Harlequins from South Africa, as guests of the Kenya Harlequin F.C. and the Rugby Football Union of East Africa; the club won five and drew one. The tour is notable for two facts, it was the first time that three sister clubs of the Harlequin family all played each other in a coordinated series of matches and at 19 days it was the longest overseas tour undertaken by a British club up to that time. Despite this, the tour pales to insignificance when it is realised the Pretoria club spent four weeks in East Africa playing eight matches and another in Rhodesia on the way home.

The London club arrived at Entebbe airport at dawn on 4 May and opened their tour with a 44–13 win against Uganda in Kampala on 6 May. They played West Kenya Province at Kitale (winning 24–6), and the Pretoria Harlequins on Saturday 13 May at the RFUEA ground, Nairobi (winning 13 – 11). The next two matches were played at the same location, beating the host club 16–0 the next day and earning a 9-all tie against Kenya Central Province on Wednesday 17 May. The last match for the London club was against Kenya at Nakuru on Saturday 20 May (winning 8–0). This last match was played under a typical &quot;long-rains&quot; shower that, though heavy, did not soften the hard ground enough to be a problem.

===Acquisition of The Stoop===
In 1963, Harlequin FC acquired an athletics ground with 14 acres (57,000 m2) just over the road from the Twickenham ground, which became its training pitch. This subsequently become their home: the Stoop Memorial Ground which in 2005 was renamed The Twickenham Stoop. This is named after Adrian Dura Stoop, who won 15 caps for England and is said to have been the person who developed modern back play.

===League rugby and the professional era===
With the introduction of leagues in 1987 bringing a more competitive environment, Harlequins maintained their status in the Premier Division as one of England&#x27;s top 12 clubs until 2005.

The club has won the Rugby Football Union clubs knockout competition on two occasions: the John Player Cup in 1988 and Pilkington Cup in 1991. In addition, they played in the finals of 1992, 1993 and 2001.

Harlequins hold the world record for providing the most players from one club (8) in a Rugby World Cup final. In the second ever RWC final at Twickenham in November 1991, seven Harlequin players appeared for England (Will Carling, Simon Halliday, Jason Leonard, Brian Moore, Paul Ackford, Mickey Skinner, Peter Winterbottom) and Troy Coker played in the Australian pack.

They are also affiliated with amateur team Harlequin Amateurs.

Harlequins became the first British team to win the European Shield in 2001, defeating Narbonne 42–33 in the final. They then became the first team to win the tournament twice, defeating Montferrand 27–26 in the final of the renamed Parker Pen Challenge Cup on 22 May 2004.
In 2005 they were relegated to National Division One after finishing at the bottom of the Zurich Premiership. In July of that year they announced that they would be establishing a partnership with rugby league club London Broncos, which saw the two clubs sharing Harlequins home ground The Stoop from the start of the 2006 Super League season. As part of the deal, the Broncos changed their name to Harlequins RL, though the two clubs remain under separate ownership.

In 2005–06, Quins utterly dominated National Division One. They won 25 of their 26 league matches, including their first 19, losing only at Exeter Chiefs on 25 February 2006. Quins also averaged nearly 40 points per match, scored four or more tries in 20 matches, and racked up an average victory margin of slightly over 25 points. They secured their return to the Premiership on 1 April with four matches to spare, crushing Sedgley Park 65–8 while the only team with a mathematical chance of pipping them for the title, Bedford, lost 26–23 at Exeter.

For the 2008 tour to New Zealand, England coach Martin Johnson selected four Harlequin players to play for the tour, Nick Easter, David Strettle, Mike Brown and Danny Care. Also five Harlequin players were selected for the England Saxons Barclays Churchill Cup matches to the United States and Canada. Tom Guest, Chris Robshaw, Adrian Jarvis, Ugo Monye and Will Skinner were all selected with Will Skinner chosen as captain for the side.

=== 2007–08 season ===
Chris Robshaw played a leading role in the 2007–08 season as Harlequins won 12 of their 22 Guinness Premiership matches and finished 6th in the league. Harlequins got off to a shaky start which saw them be in 2nd, 3rd 4th place consecutively, and during the latter half of the season Halequins managed to reach third after a string of seven wins out of nine, but defeats to London Irish, Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers to finish the season meant that Quins dropped to sixth and missed out on the play-offs.

Two Harlequins players were short-listed for awards, Danny Care and Chris Robshaw, were short-listed for the Land Rover Discovery of the Season award. As well as Coach Dean Richards being short-listed for the O2 Director of Rugby of the Season as well as Tom Guest being nominated for MBNA Try of the Season for his try against Leeds Carnegie on Sunday 13 April 2008.

===2008–09 season===

Players to leave Quins at the end of the 2007–08 season were Adrian Jarvis, Hal Luscombe, Chris Hala&#x27;ufia, Paul Volley, Nicholas Spanghero, Simon Keogh, Ricky Nebbett and Ryan Manyika.
For the 2008–09 season Quins signed five new players; London Irish centre Gonzalo Tiesi, Ulster Back-row forward Neil McMillan, Auckland Blues fly-half Nick Evans, Tongan international Epi Taione who plays on wing, centre and back row and Fijian utility back Waisea Luveniyali.

Quins finished second in the 2008-09 Guinness Premiership table. In the play-offs, they lost 0–17 at home to eventual losing finalists London Irish.

Quins also hosted their first &quot;Big Game&quot; at Twickenham over the Christmas period, playing out a 26–26 draw with Leicester Tigers in front of 52000 people.

In the 2008-09 Heineken Cup Harlequins came top of their pool, including beating Stade Français both at home (thanks to a dramatic last play drop goal from Nick Evans) and away in front of 80000 people in the Stade de France in Paris. They lost 5–6 at the Stoop to eventual tournament winners Leinster Rugby at the quarter-final stage, a match in which the infamous Bloodgate Scandal took place.

=== 2009–10 season ===
The contrast between this season and the previous season could hardly have been greater. With the shadow of Bloodgate still hanging over the club, the club struggled to an 8th-place finish despite retaining most of the players from their successful previous campaign. They also made a swift exit from the Heineken Cup at the group stages while failing to chalk up a single victory in the competition. Owing to the club&#x27;s lower league position, they failed to qualify for the competition for the first time in three years.

Quins also hosted their second &quot;Big Game&quot; at Twickenham. Despite losing 20–21 to &quot;London&quot; Wasps, the game attracted 76000 spectators.

Following the resignation of Dean Richards in August 2009, Conor O&#x27;Shea was appointed Director of Rugby in March 2010.

=== 2010–11 season ===
Harlequins endured a mixed 2010–11 season, which was characterised by inconsistency. They finished seventh in the league, which was insufficient to ensure Heineken Cup qualification. However, they proved their potential with some inspiring performances on their way to the Amlin Cup final. This included a historic win away against Munster in the semi-final, where they became only the second club to beat the Irish province at home in a European Competition. Harlequins won the final (19–18) against Stade Français to win its 3rd Amlin Cup.

=== 2011–2012 season ===
Harlequins started the season well, winning their first ten premiership games before losing to Saracens at Twickenham Stadium in &quot;Big Game 4&quot; in front of a then club record for a premiership crowd and a world record for the highest attendance of a regular season club fixture, consisting of 82,000. The club&#x27;s results after the defeat to Saracens continued to be generally strong, with only three other defeats in the regular season and the club went on to finish top of the league. They played Northampton Saints at the Twickenham Stoop on 12 May 2012, a match which they won thanks to a 25–23 victory sealed with a try in the 77th minute by Joe Marler. Harlequins beat Leicester Tigers on 26 May 2012, in the Premiership final at Twickenham Stadium to win their first Aviva Premiership title with a score of 30–23 in front of an 81,779 crowd. Tom Williams and Chris Robshaw scored the tries and Nick Evans scored 20 points through penalties and a conversion. Chris Robshaw was named man of the match. Nick Evans also equalled the record at the time for the most conversions by one player in a Premiership final with six.

During this season, Harlequins played in the Heineken Cup thanks to their victory in the Amlin Cup the season before. However, they lost out on a quarter final spot in the last game of the pool stage after a defeat to Connacht. Subsequently, they went into the Amlin Cup competition but were resoundingly beaten by Toulon. Harlequins also played in the LV= Cup but did not make it out of their group with two wins and two losses.

=== 2012–2013 season ===

Harlequins started their 2012–2013 season with four straight wins before suffering a first setback at the hands of Saracens at home in round 5 and at Exeter Chiefs in round 6. The club then managed to stay within the first two places of the table. On 29 December Big Game 5 proved to be a success with a 26–15 win over London Irish before a capacity crowd of 82,000 at Twickenham Stadium. Later in the season, the second setback came in the return game against Exeter when the Chiefs defeated Harlequins. The slide continued as they suffered back-to-back defeats against Saracens and Gloucester. They secured their place in the play-offs, but lost to Leicester at Welford Road in the semi-final 33–16.

Having qualified for the 2012-13 Heineken Cup on the virtue of their 2012 English Premiership title, Harlequins produced a strong showing in the pool stage, remaining unbeaten in pool 3 against Biarritz Olympique, Connacht Rugby and Zebre to be granted No. 1 seed for the quarter-finals. However, they lost to No. 8 seed Munster at home 12–18 in the quarter-final.

The LV= Cup featured a Harlequins team stripped of its players on international duty. Relying on a team of developing players, the club remained unbeaten throughout the pool stage. Harlequins beat Bath Rugby (31–23) in the semi-final at The Stoop, and defeated and Sale Sharks (32–14) in the final at Sixways Stadium. This was Harlequins&#x27; third title in the English/Anglo-Welsh Cup and the first since the inception of the Anglo-Welsh format. This title granted Harlequins a place in the 2013-14 Heineken Cup.

=== 2013–2014 season ===

==== Aviva Premiership ====
Harlequins made a disappointing start to the new season suffering two defeats in their opening two home games against Northampton and Saracens. Injuries stalled their start to the season, and they found themselves in seventh after five games. Their season did eventually improve and they did begin to challenge for a top four spot. But four consecutive away defeats set them back again. They were left in sixth place, six points behind fourth, with four games left to play. A series of several closely fought wins including a try bonus point in the penultimate game against Exeter Chiefs ensured they would face a winner takes all home tie against Bath in the final round of the regular season. A 19–16 win in this game saw them march on to a semi-final at Allianz Park having finished level on points with Bath but crucially winning one more game. Saracens won the semi-final to end Quins&#x27; hopes, beating them 31–17.

==== Heineken Cup and Europe ====
Harlequins also made a poor start in Europe suffering a 26–33 home defeat against Scarlets before being beaten at Clermont Auvergne. They replied strongly with back to back wins over Racing Metro. They lost their next home game against Clermont after they lost a 13–3 lead. They did win their last game at Scarlets to secure a place in the second tier Amlin Challenge Cup competition. They won their quarter final 29–6 at Stade Francais, but lost to Northampton Saints in the next round.

=== 2014–2015 season ===

==== Aviva Premiership ====
Harlequins were inconsistent at the start of the season and won half of their opening six games before heading into Europe.

The rest of the season saw this pattern continue and Quins finished 8th.

==== European Rugby Champions Cup ====
Harlequins beat Castres Olympique in the first ever European Rugby Champions Cup match before an away win at Wasps and defeating Leinster at home. However, subsequent losses away to Leinster, and then at home to Wasps ensured Harlequins finished third in their group and were knocked out of the tournament.

=== 2015–2016 season ===

==== Aviva Premiership ====
The start of the 2015/16 season was delayed by the 2015 Rugby World Cup. However Harlequins made a strong start having a good first half to the season. They were in 3rd place in mid-January.

One of the highlights of the seasons was the home defeat of Saracens. At that time Quins hadn&#x27;t beaten Saracens for 4 years and Saracens were unbeaten in their first eight games of the season.

Following this game Quins&#x27; form deteriorated, first giving away a 9-point lead at Newcastle followed by a home defeat by Northampton when fly half Ben Botica failed to kick the ball out of the play when the game had finished. It was the start of a run of 7 defeats in 9 games and, after being thrashed by the Exeter Chiefs on the final day of the season 24–62, Quins failed to earn a place in the European Champions Cup, finishing in 7th; one place below the top six finish required to qualify.

==== European Rugby Challenge Cup ====
Quins put in a very strong performance in the group stage of the Challenge Cup, topping their pool and winning all of their first five games with a bonus point. This gave them a home quarter final.

They fought back from 18 to 30 down against London Irish to win and reach a home semi-final against Grenoble, they comfortably won that game to set up a final against Montpellier in Lyon. After their League form had left them out of the Champions Cup places, they needed victory to ensure a place in the competition next season. They slipped to a 26–9 deficit and got within 7 points but Ben Botica inexplicably kicked the ball out of play in his last game before heading to Montpellier to hand his new club the title, leaving Quins as runners-up and out of the Champions Cup for a second consecutive season.

=== The John Kingston Era (2016-2018) ===

Following Conor O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s departure at the end of the 2015/16 season, Quins appointed John Kingston, then head coach, as his successor. A strong end to Kingston&#x27;s first season left Quins on the brink of European Champions Cup qualification for the first time in three seasons.

It was achieved after a bonus point away at Northampton Saints on the last day of the season secured sixth place, with the Saints themselves missing out on games won.

Following the 2017/18 season, Kingston left Harlequins by mutual consent after 17 years of service to the club. His final home game featured a walk of honour around the stadium as thousands of fans applauded.

=== 2018 to present ===

==== 2018–19 season ====
Harlequins then turned to appointing England defence coach Paul Gustard. At the same time, a number of coaches departed, or moved into smaller roles including Mark Mapletoft and Nick Easter, who had previously been Head Coach and Defence Coach before Gustard&#x27;s appointment. After a patchy start to the 2018–19 season, Harlequins went on a five match winning run in the Premiership to move up to third, seven points clear of third place Gloucester.

Quins would have all-but sealed a place in the playoffs with victory, but were hammered 29–7 in front of their own fans, as Gloucester claimed a bonus point victory to move within touching distance of the London club. Ill-disciplined defeats at Saracens and Sale followed before a defining moment against Northampton Saints. Quins were within 90 seconds of recording a victory which would have effectively ended the hopes of Northampton and given themselves fresh momentum as the season headed into its last few games, but a try from Alex Mitchell, helped by a lack of defensive numbers on the blindside, gave Saints the victory and brought them up to fifth, right on Quins&#x27; tail.

A late penalty miss saw Quins narrowly beaten at Exeter, and though they managed to beat Leicester in the penultimate weekend, defeat on the final day against Wasps would see them miss out on the play-offs. They were tied on points with Saints, but missed out due to fewer match wins, finishing fifth overall. James Lang&#x27;s late penalty attempt would have won them the game, and secured their place in the play-offs had it gone over, but it was inexplicably taken at least a metre behind where it had been awarded in the view of TV pundit and former player Austin Healey and ultimately fell under the crossbar by &quot;the distance Austin was talking about that they were marched back,&quot; according to fellow pundit and his former teammate Ben Kay.

In the Challenge Cup, Harlequins put together an impressive run, topping their group before edging Worcester Warriors in the quarter-final to book a semi-final trip to Clermont Auvergne. An impressive second half fightback was not enough as they were beaten 32–27. They won just one of their four pool matches in the Premiership Cup, to bow out at the group stage.

==== 2019–20 season ====
Harlequins made 32 personnel changes after the 2018–19 season, as Gustard looked to freshen up his squad, and after only winning one of their first four games, Quins would remain unbeaten for the rest of the calendar year. However, a 48–10 defeat to Sale, their most comprehensive league defeat since defeat by the same margin against Exeter nearly four years earlier, and an early exit from Europe spelt a disappointing start to the season.

Quins would eventually finish 3rd in their Champions&#x27; Cup pool with home and away victories over Bath, but as their league form continued to fluctuate, their main contention for silverware would come in the Premiership Cup. Having earned a place in the semi-finals at the start of the season, whilst the World Cup took place, they hammered a young Exeter Chiefs side 49–22 away from home to reach the final. This was set for 15 March 2020, before being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Following the resumption of the season, Quins recorded solid form to finish comfortably in sixth and earn qualification for the Champions Cup. Nonetheless, Gustard&#x27;s hopes of a first trophy were dashed as the London club were beaten 27–19 against Sale in the Premiership Cup Final despite leading for most of the game.

==== 2020–21 season ====
Harlequins began their season with a 3–33 loss at home to Exeter Chiefs. By 10 January 2021, the club were positioned seventh in the Premiership table, failing to record a win at home and having also suffered a record 7–49 home defeat at the hands of Racing 92 in the Champions Cup.

On 20 January 2021, it was confirmed that Paul Gustard left his role as Harlequins Director of Rugby by mutual consent .

Harlequins went on to win 10 of their next 14 games, securing a fourth-place playoff position in the Premiership. On 19 June 2021, they played league leaders Bristol Bears at Ashton Gate, conceding 28 points in the first half an hour of the match to trail 28–0 before half-time. Harlequins went on to undertake the biggest comeback in Premiership Rugby history to finish the match 31–31 after 80 minutes, going on to win 36–43 after extra time to book their place in the final.

On 26 June 2021, Harlequins played Exeter Chiefs at Twickenham, defeating the incumbent champions 38–40 to win their second Premiership title. A number of records were broken during this game. During the match Louis Lynagh scored two late tries, equalling the record at the time for the most tries scored by any individual player in a final while also becoming the youngest ever try scorer in a Premiership final at just 20years and 205 days old. This final also set the record for having both the most points and most tries combined of any Premiership final in the history of the competition.

On 2 July 2021, it was confirmed that Tabai Matson would join the club as Head Coach for the 2021–22 season.

==== 2023-24 season ====

Following the financial collapse of London rival London Irish, Harlequins made a number of signings from their former rival including 20-year old England international Will Joseph, replacing the departing Joe Marchant who was joining Stade Français; England u-20 back rower Chandler Cunningham-South and prop Lovejoy Chawatama. This was on top of a number of other signings including England international, former Wasps captain and Harlequins academy member Joe Launchbury who joined the club on a multi-year deal.

Harlequins began their season with a narrow 29–28 loss to Gloucester. New signing Jarrod Evans had seemingly won the game in the final minutes by extending Harlequins&#x27; lead only for the try to be ruled out for foul play. Gloucester went on to win the game in the final play

In November 2023, they briefly went top of the Gallagher Premiership for the first time in the season after wins against Leicester Tigers, Bristol Bears and Exeter Chiefs. Many of the team&#x27;s England and South Africa players, including Marcus Smith, Danny Care and André Esterhuizen were still returning to the starting XV having played at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

In March 2024, it was announced that Director of Performance Development, Tabai Matson, would depart the club at the end of the season.

During their Champions Cup campaign, they defeated Glasgow Warriors 28–24 at home in the Round of 16 to win their first ever Champions Cup knockout game. After a 42–41 away victory over Bordeaux Bègles in the quarter finals they reached their first ever semi-final in the competition. Despite a &#x27;spirited&#x27; performance, they were defeated 38–26 at this stage by the eventual winners Toulouse at the Stadium de Toulouse.

==== 2024-25 season ====

In October 2024, they beat Saracens 17–10 to secure their first win over their rivals in four years. Later that month they beat Exeter Chiefs 36–19 to secure their first win at Sandy Park in 10 years, moving up to fifth in the table in the process. Before the 2024 Autumn Nations Series, England head coach Steve Borthwick announced the introduction of Enhanced Elite Player Squad (EPS) contracts designed designed to give the national team final say over medical matters and development programs. Marcus Smith became the first player at the club to be awarded one of these contracts. In December 2024, they lost 14–0 away to Gloucester, the first time in over 10 years that they had failed to score a point in a Premiership fixture.

In December 2024, Harlequins CEO, Laurie Dalrymple, revealed the club were looking into hosting an exhibition match overseas with Singapore being the ideal location.

==Stadium==


Harlequins play at the Twickenham Stoop, at Twickenham in London. The stadium is named after former England international Adrian Stoop, who was a Harlequins player and later president of the club.

The club acquired the then athletics pitch in 1963, a ground of , close by to the RFU ground. It became the training pitch, and eventually, the Harlequins home ground. The site provided a ground that could be extended, and there have been many upgrades since, leading to a current capacity of 14,800. The stadium was known as the Stoop Memorial Ground for many years, but it was renamed the Twickenham Stoop in 2005.

In 2017 Harlequins engaged with architects and considered plans to increase capacity to 25,000, but that has not progressed.

Harlequins also play two games at Twickenham Stadium, one in December called the Big Game, the other in June called the Big Summer Kick-Off.

==Harlequins Foundation==
The Harlequins Foundation was set up in 2015 as an independent charity (1161838).

It delivers two flagship programmes: Switch – a women and girls project which aims to develop female leaders, and METTLE – a project that develops skills and knowledge to improve physical health and mental well-being for 9-12 year olds. The METTLE pilot was evaluated by St Mary&#x27;s University and the programme was found to have had a positive impact on young people&#x27;s self-confidence, wellbeing, decision making and mental resilience.

In September 2018, The Harlequins Foundation and The Movember Foundation announced a long-term partnership in joint initiative committed to help rugby fans, and the wider community, address the issues around men&#x27;s health and provide information and guidance on what to do when mental health suffers.

The foundation delivers the Premiership Rugby Funded Programmes: Move like a Pro, Project Rugby, Tackling Health and Hitz.

Additionally the charity allocates grants to local organisations and charities in the local community.

In 2020 it was announced that The Harlequins Foundation would partner with The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award and become the only Premiership Rugby club licensed to deliver the DofE.

== Rivalries ==
Harlequins maintain a number of rivalries across English rugby, namely teams in the Greater London area.

Many consider Harlequins&#x27; main rivalry to be Wasps RFC. Both clubs were originally founded as one club, Hampstead Football Club, in 1866. Wasps were founded as a result of a disagreement between members of the club a year later. Hampstead Football Club changed its name to Harlequins in 1870. Despite Wasps&#x27; move away from the London metro area to Coventry in 2014, the rivalry still persists because of its historical roots.

Other rivalries include Saracens F.C. and London Irish, both of whom are Premiership clubs that reside in north and west London respectively.

Since the financial collapse of both Wasps and London Irish during the 2022–23 season, Harlequins biggest rivalry has been with Saracens with many considering it to be the most bitter rivalry in the Premiership.

==Controversies==

During the quarter-final of the 2009 Heineken Cup against Leinster, Harlequins wing Tom Williams came off the field with what turned out to be a faked blood injury to facilitate a tactical substitution of fly-half Nick Evans back onto the field. An investigation by the ERC and the RFU revealed that blood injuries had also been faked by Harlequins to enable tactical substitutions on four previous occasions. These findings resulted in a twelve-month ban for Williams – reduced to 4 months on appeal, a three-year ban for former director of rugby Dean Richards and a two-year ban for physiotherapist Steph Brennan as well as a £260,000 fine for the club.
The club chairman Charles Jillings subsequently tendered his resignation while the club doctor Wendy Chapman was suspended by the General Medical Council for cutting Williams&#x27;s lip to hide his use of the blood capsule.
On 2 September 2009, it was reported that the club had narrowly escaped being thrown out of the Heineken Cup following the scandal when the board of organisers European Rugby Cup (ERC) said it approved of the bans and fines already handed out.

The affair was dubbed by many in the media &quot;Bloodgate&quot; with three proven incidents of the medical staff colluding with former director of rugby Dean Richards to abuse the blood-substitution rule. The rule was brought in to help with player welfare but was shown to have been abused by former policeman Richards, along with Dr Wendy Chapman, who was given an official warning by the Medical Council.

==Kit==

The Harlequins kit is one of the most distinctive in the game, and remained largely unchanged for many years. The kit has always featured a quartered shirt, typically consisting of chocolate brown, French grey, magenta and light blue with black and green sleeves, and most design changes have merely meant changes to the dimensions of the quarters, or the layout of the four main colours.

Following several Adidas home kit variations focused upon the four &quot;Quins quarters&quot; colours, the 2021–22 season home shirt sees a return to a more traditional design with the inclusion of green and black sleeves, whilst the 2020–22 away shirt in red and white features a stylised aerial representation of the London area and River Thames. In July 2022, The Harlequins announced that the club had signed a multi-year partnership deal with the British sportswear brand Castore ahead of the 2022–23 season. The partnership will see Castore both design and manufacture the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s home kits, training and travel-wear in addition to the youth teams kit.

<text>Malaika Nakupenda Malaika is a Swahili song written by Tanzanian artist, Adam Salim in 1945 and recorded for the first time by Kenyan musician, Fadhili William. This song is possibly the most famous of all Swahili love songs in Tanzania, Kenya and the entire East Africa, as well as being one of the most widely known of all Swahili songs in the world. &quot;Malaika&quot; in this context means &quot;angel&quot; in Swahili, and this word has always been used by the Swahili speakers to refer to a beautiful girl.

The lyrics of the song differ slightly from version to version; the title itself is subject to variation, such as &quot;Ewe Malaika&quot; (Oh, Angel) or &quot;My Angel&quot;.

== Authorship and covers ==
Authorship of this popular song is still very controversial. However, most people accredit its authorship to Adam Salim, a not-well-published Tanzanian songwriter. Salim (born in 1916) composed this song while he was living in Nairobi between 1945 and 1946. According to this story, Adam Salim composed &quot;Malaika&quot; song in 1945 for his very beautiful girlfriend Halima Ramadhani Maruwa. Their parents disapproved of their relationship, and Halima was forced by her parents to marry an Asian tajir (wealthy man). Fadhili William, a Kenyan singer, is also associated with the song because he is the first person to record it. Producer Charles Worrod provides yet another version, crediting the song to Grant Charo, William&#x27;s brother-in-law (see Ondevo 2006), a claim which is also associated with the fact that Fadhili William was the first person to record the song. Charo is not known to have confirmed this claim.

Another East African claiming to have written the song is Lucas Tututu from Mombasa.

Although Fadhili William has always insisted on his authorship of &quot;Malaika&quot;, even providing a detailed description of the circumstances in which he wrote it, he is only recognized as the composer for royalty purposes. In any case, William was the first to record the song, together with his band The Jambo Boys, in 1960.

It was later re-recorded at Equator Sound Studios by the British-born Kenyan music promoter Charles Worrod, who marketed the ballad to eventually becoming an internationally acclaimed song.

Miriam Makeba&#x27;s early recording helped make it famous throughout the continent and eventually the world. Her performances of the song brought it to the attention of such famous names as Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger, Boney M, Usha Uthup and Angélique Kidjo.

The song has been covered by many other international artists such as the Hep Stars, Boney M, the Brothers Four, Helmut Lotti, Rocco Granata, Saragossa Band and is a staple for many African musicians. In 2023 South African music group The Soil recorded their own version inspired by the Miriam Makeba rendition from the 1980s.

== Lyrics and meaning ==
The lyrics of the song differ slightly from version to version, with verses commonly rearranged, omitted, or combined. The Swahili dialect is likely Tanzanian, possibly Kenyan. Kidjo&#x27;s and Makeba&#x27;s versions change the song considerably.

The early Fadhili William recording (1959) has only two verses. However, Miriam Makeba&#x27;s recording has a third verse (the Pesa... verse) and a later record by Fadhili also has the Pesa verse.

The song is sung by a poor young man who wishes to marry his beloved &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Little bird&quot; but is defeated by the bride price.

== Hep Stars version ==
=== Background ===
By the end of 1966, the Hep Stars had achieved ten top-10 hits in Sweden, while simultaneously enjoying their fifth number-1 single &quot;Consolation&quot;. They had by now accounted to 10% of all record sales in the country, with specifically Benny Andersson, who composed most of their singles, enjoying the royalties. It was also around this time that the Hep Stars had decided that they wanted to star in a movie, in similar fashion to the Beatles &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;. A person outside of the group decided that the majority of the film were to be shot in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. The group started traveling to Kenya without a screenplay, with drummer Christer Petterson admitting that a coherent screenplay first was attempted aboard the airplane.

After arriving at Embakasi Airport (later renamed to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), the group continued to film their projected movie during the morning hours. Their knowledge of &quot;Malaika&quot; was entirely coincidental, as during their stay at a hotel in the capital, the Hep Stars were eating dinner and were suddenly approached by a chef, who worked in the hotel restaurant. Having heard the statement that the Hep Stars were &quot;the Swedish Beatles&quot;, he brought a guitar and started playing the song for them, much to their liking. After finishing shooting the Kenyan parts of their movie, the group traveled back to Sweden, and entered Europafilm Studios in April to record &quot;Malaika&quot; with Gert Palmcrantz producing.

=== Release ===
Liking the song, the single was released the same month, becoming their first single released in 1967. It was issued by their record label Olga Records with the catalogue number SO 38. The B-side was the Andersson composition &quot;It&#x27;s Nice to Be Back&quot;, which was intended as the closing song for the Hep Stars movie, upon their return to Stockholm.

The single first entered Kvällstoppen on 9 May 1967 at a position of number 4. The following week it had climbed all the way to number 1, a position it would prove to hold for five consecutive week. On 20 June it had descended to number 2, staying there for three weeks. On 11 July, it hit number 5 for one week, before descending to number 7, where it would stay for three weeks. On 8 August, it was at number 8 before traveling to number 9 the following week, a position it hold for one week. On 22 August, it descended to number 10, before exiting the top-10 for the first time on 29 August, where it was noted at number 15. &quot;Malaika&quot; was last seen on the chart on 5 September at a position of number 16. In total, &quot;Malaika&quot; spent 18 weeks on the chart, of which sixteen were in the top-10, ten were in the top-5 and five were at number 1. The single was also successful on &quot;Tio i Topp&quot;, where it reached number 6, spending two weeks on the chart. It was the only fully African language-song to reach number one on a Swedish chart.

=== Personnel ===

* Svenne Hedlund – lead vocals
* Janne Frisk – guitar, harmony vocals
* Lennart Hegland – bass guitar, harmony vocals
* Benny Andersson – piano, harmony vocals
* Christer Petterson – drums, harmony vocals

It is unclear who plays the flute solo on the recording.

=== Charts ===
== Boney M. version ==
The version by German band Boney M. is the first single taken from their fifth album &quot;Boonoonoonoos&quot; (1981). It peaked at #13 in the German charts, their lowest placing so far after their commercial breakthrough. Boney M. would use the double A-side format in this period, typically with the A1 being the song intended for radio and A2 being more squarely aimed at discos. &quot;Consuela Biaz&quot; was first promoted as the A-side in Germany where the group performed it in pop show Musikladen. After a promotional visit to Spain where the group found &quot;Malaika&quot; had become a Top 10 hit, the title was remixed and then promoted as the A-side. It was the second consecutive Boney M. single not to be released in the UK, and their first not to be released in Japan.

The original German and Spanish 4:30 single mix featured no percussion ad-libs and most notably, after the second verse it has a key-change to a drum, handclaps and a cappella chant before the song quickly fades. When producer Frank Farian remixed the song for the 12&quot; single and a new 7&quot; edit, he added more percussion and synth and deleted this key-change part, replacing it with an outro with himself singing &quot;Wimoweh, wimoweh&quot; (deliberately borrowed from another African tune &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;).

<text>Minnesota State Highway 7, or Trunk Highway 7, (MN 7, TH 7) is a state highway in Minnesota, which runs from its intersection with MN 28 near Beardsley and continues east to its terminus with MN 100 and County Road 25 (CR 25) in St. Louis Park. The highway runs east–west for approximately through mostly rural farmland in the central part of the state. On its western end, it is part of the Minnesota River Valley Scenic Byway where it runs northwest–southeast along the Minnesota River and associated lakes near the border with the adjoining state of South Dakota. For roughly of its route, it runs concurrently with U.S. Highway 59 (US 59) between Appleton and Montevideo. In Montevideo, the highway turns to the east cutting across the state. It passes through several small towns before entering the Twin Cities metropolitan area. In the metro area, MN 7 follows an expressway through several suburbs before terminating in St. Louis Park. Two different segments have been listed on the National Highway System, system of roads considered important to the country.

The highway was first designated along a series of roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture of gravel and bitumen surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today&#x27;s asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN 7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway in the Twin Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a hard-surface by the end of that decade. The highway was truncated in the Twin Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were applied at the state and federal levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively.

==Route description==
Legally, MN 7 is defined as several different constitutional and legislative routes in state law. The highway follows roadways defined as parts of constitutional routes 12 and 40 in . The remainder of the highway follows all, or part, of legislative routes 119, 147, 148, 304, and 319 in the . The highway is not marked with these routes number along the actual highway. The route of MN 7 between Ortonville and Montevideo along with the segment between I-494 and MN 100 in the Twin Cities have been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. Like other trunk highways in the state, MN 7 is maintained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). According to the department, up 12,000 vehicles a day used the highway outside of the Twin Cities, and up to 55,000 vehicles traveled the highway daily in the metro area in 2010.

===Beardsley to Montevideo===
The highway starts at an intersection with MN 28 on the eastern edge of Beardsley and heads south. From here, MN 7 passes through farm fields before turning southeasterly along the shore of Big Stone Lake. The lake is the source of the Minnesota River and forms the Minnesota–South Dakota state line in Big Stone County. The highway in this area is also a part of the Minnesota River Valley Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and a Minnesota State Scenic Byway. The road turns eastward along a bend in the lake near the community of Foster before running further inland around Big Stone Lake State Park. Past the park, MN 7 curves to the south along the shore and continues to Ortonville. The highway follows 2nd Street through town along the lake shore and through residential neighborhoods. South of the end of the lake, MN 7 merges with US 12, and the two highways run concurrently for about a couple blocks. South of town, MN 7 merges onto US 75 and the combined highway runs along the Minnesota River. The roadway also runs parallel to a line of the BNSF Railway used by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad in the area. East of the Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge and the town of Odessa, US 75 and the scenic byway turn south to cross the river, separating from MN 7 which continues along the northern banks of the river.

Near the town of Correll, MN 7 follows the northern shore of Marsh Lake to Appleton. The highway turns due east along Logan Avenue to enter town. MN 7 follows both US 59 and MN 119 in a triple concurrency on along Munsterman Street through town. At the intersection with Minnesota Street near the Swift County Fairgrounds, US 59/MN 7 turns southeasterly separating from MN 119. The highway then continues southeasterly running inland from Lac qui Parle through farm country to the town of Milan. There it crosses to the south side of the railroad before intersecting MN 40 and exiting town. In Watson, the scenic byway route rejoins MN 7 and follows it south to Montevideo. On the southern edge of the city, MN 7 turns northward, separating from US 59 and joining MN 29.

===Montevideo to Hutchinson===
Continuing northward in Montevideo, the highway turns back to the east between J. Harley Smith and Lagoon parks. MN 29 separates at the intersection between Washington Avenue and 8th Street, and MN 7 continues eastward on Washington through residential areas. The avenue passes the hospital before leaving town. The street name attached to the highway in rural Chippewa County is 50th Street as MN 7 runs due east through farm country. The highway crosses another line of the BNSF Railway and MN 23 in Clara City before meandering southwesterly to follow 60th Street near Bunde. East of this unincorporated community, the highway crosses into Kandiyohi County. The highway follows 195th Avenue through the southern part of the county, passing through the communities of Prinsburg and Lake Lillian. In between, it passes south of Blomkest where it intersects US 71.
The next county along the course of MN 7 is Meeker County. Running due east through farmlands in the southern area of that county, the highway intersects MN 4 in Cosmos and passes through Cedar Mills. Just east of Cedar Mills, MN 7 crosses into McLeod County and merges with MN 22. The combined highway turns southeasterly toward Hutchinson. On the west side of town, the roadway crosses Campbell Lake and follows an arm of the lake through the downtown area. The highway passes several parks before coming to an intersection with MN 15 and exiting the business district for residential neighborhoods. MN 22 separates from MN 7 east of Hutchinson, and the latter highway continues eastward.

===Hutchinson to St. Louis Park===
In rural eastern McLeod County, MN 7 jogs to the north around Silver Lake in the city of the same name. Northeast of Lester Prairie, the highway crosses into Carver County. This area is also rural farm country as the roadway bypasses New Germany and Mayer to the north. Near the latter community, MN 7 intersects MN 25 which provides a connection to both Mayer and the city of Watertown. North of Waconia, the roadway begins to meander southeasterly through an area dotted with several lakes and crosses into the western edge of the Twin Cities metropolitan area.
After briefly passing through Hennepin County in the communities of St. Bonifacius and Minnetrista, MN 7 crosses back into Carver County. In the city of Victoria the highway rounds the southern end of Lake Minnetonka. As MN 7 begins to turn back northeasterly, it crosses into western Hennepin County at Shorewood. The highway widens out to a four-lane divided highway near the intersection with MN 41. This divided highway has a partial interchange with Mill Street in Excelsior near the St. Albans Bay of Lake Minnetonka. This area transitions into a full suburban residential area by the time the highway crosses into Minnetonka. The highway passes north of the campus for Minnetonka High School near the intersection with County Road 101 (CR 101). Access to MN 7 through the area is restricted to major intersections only for the most part, making the highway an expressway rather than a true freeway. While still in Minnetonka, MN 7 passes through a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 494 (I-494) which is one half of the Twin Cities&#x27; beltway. Immediately adjacent to the cloverleaf is another interchange for CR 60 (Baker Road). The expressway continues northeasterly through the suburb of Hopkins before crossing into St. Louis Park.

The western edge of St. Louis Park is marked by the interchange with US 169. The area immediately adjacent to MN 7 in this suburb is filled with commercial properties on either side of access roads. East of Texas Ave S, MN 7 becomes a freeway with three interchanges. The first is a dumbbell interchange with Louisiana Ave. East of Louisiana Avenue, the highway is parallel to a line of the Twin Cities and Western Railroad. There is another interchange for Wooddale Avenue before MN 7 meets, and terminates at, the interchange for MN 100 near the Peavey–Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator, the country&#x27;s first concrete grain elevator. The expressway continues east for approximately another mile (1.6 km) as CR 25.

==History==
First authorized in 1933–34, MN 7 ran between Appleton and the Twin Cities. At the time, the highway was under construction between Ortonville and Appleton. From its junction with MN 119, MN 7 was a gravel road southeasterly to Montevideo before turn east on a bituminous surface to Clara City. From there east to the Waconia area, the highway was gravel, and the remainder was bituminous. No sections at the time were paved in asphalt. The segment from Appleton northwesterly to Odessa was completed by the early part of 1935 connecting the highway to US 75. By 1952, the highway had been expanded to four lanes between Excelsior and the Twin Cities. In 1958, the highway was extended northwesterly along US 75 from Odessa to Ortonville and continuing on to Beardsley. The highway between Beardsley and Ortonville had been MN 103 since the 1930s.

The route was completely paved by 1959, the last section to be paved with at least bitumen was along the former MN 103 northwest of Ortonville. MN 7 used to extend into downtown Minneapolis until 1965, where it terminated at its intersection with Washington Avenue (old US 52). From 1965 to either 1987 or 1988, the eastern terminus was located at the intersection of Lake Street and France Avenue in Minneapolis; the part, about long, between the interchange with MN 100 and the intersection of Lake Street and France Avenue is now called County State-Aid Highway 25. In 1995, the section between MN 28 and the southern US 75 junction was named a Minnesota State Scenic Byway; it was also made a National Scenic Byway on June 13, 2002.

<text>Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia describes the condition and effects of low blood glucose caused by excessive insulin. Hypoglycemia due to excess insulin is the most common type of serious hypoglycemia. It can be due to endogenous or injected insulin.

==Signs and symptoms==
Manifestations of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia vary by age and severity of the hypoglycemia. In general, most signs and symptoms can be attributed to (1) the effects on the brain of insufficient glucose (neuroglycopenia) or (2) to the adrenergic response of the autonomic nervous system to hypoglycemia. A few miscellaneous symptoms are harder to attribute to either of these causes. In most cases, all effects are reversed when normal glucose levels are restored.

There are uncommon cases of more persistent harm, and rarely even death due to severe hypoglycemia of this type. One reason hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin can be more dangerous is that insulin lowers the available amounts of most alternate brain fuels, such as ketones. Brain damage of various types ranging from stroke-like focal effects to impaired memory and thinking can occur. Children who have prolonged or recurrent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy can suffer harm to their brains and may be developmentally delayed.

==Causes==
Hypoglycemia due to endogenous insulin can be congenital or acquired, apparent in the newborn period, or many years later. The hypoglycemia can be severe and life-threatening or a minor, occasional nuisance. By far the most common type of severe but transient hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia occurs accidentally in persons with type 1 diabetes who take insulin.

==Genetics==
There are several genetic forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia:

==Diagnosis==
When the cause of hypoglycemia is not obvious, the most valuable diagnostic information is obtained from a blood sample (a &quot;critical specimen&quot;) drawn during the hypoglycemia. Detectable amounts of insulin are abnormal and indicate that hyperinsulinism is likely to be the cause. Other aspects of the person&#x27;s metabolic state, especially low levels of free fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketones, and either high or low levels of C-peptide and proinsulin can provide confirmation.

Clinical features and circumstances can provide other indirect evidence of hyperinsulinism. For instance, babies with neonatal hyperinsulinism are often large for gestational age and may have other features such as enlarged heart and liver. Knowing that someone takes insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for diabetes obviously makes insulin excess the presumptive cause of any hypoglycemia.

Most sulfonylureas and aspirin can be detected on a blood or urine drug screen tests, but insulin cannot. Endogenous and exogenous insulin can be distinguished by the presence or absence of C-peptide, a by-product of endogenous insulin secretion which is not present in pharmaceutical insulin. Some of the newer analog insulins are not measured by the usual insulin level assays.

==Treatment==
Acute hypoglycemia is reversed by raising the blood glucose. Glucagon should be injected intramuscularly or intravenously, or dextrose can be infused intravenously to raise the blood glucose. Oral administration of glucose can worsen the outcome, as more insulin is eventually produced. Most people recover fully even from severe hypoglycemia after the blood glucose is restored to normal. Recovery time varies from minutes to hours depending on the severity and duration of the hypoglycemia. Death or permanent brain damage resembling stroke can occur rarely as a result of severe hypoglycemia. See hypoglycemia for more on effects, recovery, and risks.

Further therapy and prevention depends upon the specific cause.

Most hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin occurs in people who take insulin for type 1 diabetes. Management of this hypoglycemia is sugar or starch by mouth (or in severe cases, an injection of glucagon or intravenous dextrose). When the glucose has been restored, recovery is usually complete. Prevention of further episodes consists of maintaining balance between insulin, food, and exercise. Management of hypoglycemia due to treatment of type 2 diabetes is similar, and the dose of the oral hypoglycemic agent may need to be reduced. Reversal and prevention of hypoglycemia is a major aspect of the management of type 1 diabetes.

Hypoglycemia due to drug overdose or effect is supported with extra glucose until the drugs have been metabolized. The drug doses or combination often needs to be altered.

Hypoglycemia due to a tumor of the pancreas or elsewhere is usually curable by surgical removal. Most of these tumors are benign. Streptozotocin is a specific beta cell toxin and has been used to treat insulin-producing pancreatic carcinoma.

Hyperinsulinism due to diffuse overactivity of beta cells, such as in many of the forms of congenital hyperinsulinism, and more rarely in adults, can often be treated with diazoxide or a somatostatin analog called octreotide. Diazoxide is given by mouth, octreotide by injection or continuous subcutaneous pump infusion. When congenital hyperinsulinism is due to focal defects of the insulin-secretion mechanism, surgical removal of that part of the pancreas may cure the problem. In more severe cases of persistent congenital hyperinsulinism unresponsive to drugs, a near-total pancreatectomy may be needed to prevent continuing hypoglycemia. Even after pancreatectomy, continuous glucose may be needed in the form of gastric infusion of formula or dextrose.

High dose glucocorticoid is an older treatment used for presumptive transient hyperinsulinism but incurs side effects with prolonged use.

<text>The Soar Valley is a river valley following the course of the River Soar in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, in the East Midlands of England. Part of the Drainage basin of the River Trent stretching from south of Leicester to Trent Lock, the valley is a major geographical feature of Leicester City Centre, Greater Leicester, Loughborough, and the wider county of Leicestershire of which it forms part of the northern boundary with Nottinghamshire. The valley is home to a section of the M1 motorway, a large section of the Great Central Railway, a lengthy stretch of the Grand Union Canal, the Leicester City Ground, Abbey Park, the Abbey Pumping Station, and the National Space Centre. 

Soar Valley is also the name of an electoral ward of Rushcliffe Borough Council in south Nottinghamshire.

==Settlements==
The valley begins around the area where the Soar meets the River Sence near Enderby and Whetstone through the villages of Narborough, Blaby, and Glen Parva south of Leicester. In Leicester city the valley passes through the settlements of Braunstone, Aylestone, and the floodplains of Aylestone Meadows, past Westcotes, Bede Island and Frog Island skirting Leicester City Centre to the west, on through the villages of Quorn, Mountsorrel, Barrow upon Soar, Birstall, Rothley and Sileby and a number of smaller communities all on or near the River Soar as it flows from Leicester to Loughborough in Leicestershire. The area edges onto Charnwood Forest and the only double tracked preserved main railway line in Britain, the Great Central Railway forms a spine through the area.

==Ward and electoral district==
Downstream from Stanford on Soar the River Soar forms the boundary with Nottinghamshire and in that county Soar Valley is an electoral district for purposes of electing a councillor to Nottinghamshire County Council. The most recent election was in 2009 when Linda Sykes, of the Conservative party, won the seat. For the election of a councillor to Rushcliffe Borough Council, there is a Soar Valley ward, which covers a smaller area than the electoral district of the same name, and consists of the three parishes of Sutton Bonington, Kingston on Soar and Ratcliffe on Soar. The most recent election was in 2007 when Terry Holt, of the Liberal Democrats, won the seat.

<doc id="963586" wikidata="Q557810" url="?curid=963586" title="Anthony Weiner">
<text>Anthony David Weiner ( born September 4, 1964) is an American former politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1999 until his resignation in 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he consistently carried the district with at least 60% of the vote. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after it was revealed he sent sexually suggestive photos of himself to different women, including a minor.

A two-time candidate for Mayor of New York City, Weiner finished second in the Democratic primary in 2005. He ran again in 2013, placing fifth in the Democratic primary.

In 2017, Weiner pled guilty to transferring obscene material to a minor and was sentenced to 21 months in prison. He was also required to register as a sex offender. Weiner began serving his federal prison sentence the same year and was released in 2019.

On 10 December 2024, Weiner announced his candidacy for New York City&#x27;s 2nd City Council district.

== Early life and education ==
Weiner was born in Brooklyn in New York City, the middle son of Jewish parents, Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife, Frances (née Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher. The family lived for a time in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Weiner attended elementary school at P.S. 39 The Henry Bristow School. His older brother Seth was 39 years old when he was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 2000. His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants.

Weiner took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City&#x27;s specialized high schools, and was admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1981. He attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, and spent his junior year as an exchange student at the College of William &amp; Mary, where he was friends with future comic and political commentator Jon Stewart. Weiner&#x27;s interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator.

After he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then–United States Representative and current Senator Charles Schumer. He worked in Schumer&#x27;s Washington, D.C. office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.

== New York City Council ==
After working for Schumer for six years, Weiner got his first chance at political office in 1991 when the New York City Council was expanded from 35 to 51 seats. Weiner was considered a long-shot because he faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding. Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting Adele Cohen by fewer than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner&#x27;s campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district that had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called &quot;Jackson-Dinkins agenda&quot;; the leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen Jesse Jackson, who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as &quot;Hymietown&quot;, and then-mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.

Weiner&#x27;s win in the November general election was widely considered a formality because he had no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. He was 27 years old when he became the youngest councilman in the city&#x27;s history. Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address quality of life concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up graffiti, and he backed development plans that helped revive the historic Sheepshead Bay area.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===
In 1998, Weiner ran for Congress from New York&#x27;s 9th congressional district, which was the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who had run successfully for the U.S. Senate. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, which was tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district that included parts of southern Brooklyn and south and central Queens.

=== Domestic issues ===

Weiner received a 100% rating from the NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2003 and a 0% rating from National Right to Life Committee 2006, which indicated a strong pro-choice voting record. He was critical of the 2009 Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions, calling it &quot;unnecessary and divisive&quot; and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan.

In April 2008, Weiner created the bi-partisan Congressional Middle Class Caucus. He received an &quot;A&quot; on the Drum Major Institute&#x27;s 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues. In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of O-visas available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City. He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.

During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the United States National Health Care Act, which would have expanded Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age. He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead, private insurers put 30% of their customer&#x27;s money into profits and overhead instead of into health care. In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for single payer health care in exchange for not amending America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 in committee mark-up with a single-payer plan.

When a public health insurance option was being considered as part of America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, Weiner said that it would help reduce costs, and he set up a website to push for the option. He attracted widespread attention when described the Republican Party as &quot;a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry&quot;. In February 2010, he proclaimed to Congress that &quot;every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry.&quot;

Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009, which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal crime, and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the United States Postal Service. He claimed, &quot;This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco&quot;, and added that &quot;Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet.&quot;

On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide for funds for sick first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill.

In response to pressure from Weiner, YouTube removed some of Anwar al-Awlaki&#x27;s inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010. Weiner voted against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President Barack Obama in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be &quot;better poker players&quot; than Obama.

In 2002, Weiner voiced strong criticism of the removal of the World Trade Center debris without investigating it for determining the causes of the collapses of Tower 1, 2 and 7.

=== Foreign policy ===
In 2002, Weiner voted to give President George W. Bush the authority to use military force against Iraq. In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar the Palestinian delegation from entering the United Nations. He added that the delegation &quot;should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags&quot;, and went on to claim that Human Rights Watch, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Amnesty International are all biased against Israel.

On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush administration negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn&#x27;t want to provide &quot;sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism&quot;, noting that 15 of the 19 hijackers in the September 11 attacks were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, D.C., stating, &quot;We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can&#x27;t go unpunished.&quot; The two intended to use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.

Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration&#x27;s proposal to sell over $60 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: &quot;Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message&quot;, and described Saudi Arabia as having a &quot;history of financing terrorism&quot; and teaching &quot;hatred of Christians and Jews&quot; to its schoolchildren.

=== Management style ===
In July 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses. The newspaper described him as a person who often worked long hours with his staff and required them to be in constant contact via BlackBerry. He frequently yelled at them and occasionally threw office furniture in anger. As a result of Weiner&#x27;s actions, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress; this included the departure of three chiefs of staff within an 18-month period. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said that his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City.

=== Traffic tickets ===
A 2010 license plate check by the Capitol Hill newspaper &quot;Roll Call&quot; showed that Weiner&#x27;s vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress that had unpaid tickets. Weiner&#x27;s past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by &quot;Roll Call&quot; and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article. On June 13, 2011, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that one of Weiner&#x27;s vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles.

== Sexting scandals, prosecution, and guilty plea ==

On May 27, 2011, Weiner used his public Twitter account to send a link to a woman who was following him on the social media platform. The link contained a sexually explicit photograph of himself. After several days of denying that he had posted the image, Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had &quot;exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years&quot; and apologized for his earlier denials. After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of &quot;The Opie &amp; Anthony Show&quot;, Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress, and he formally did so on June 21. A special election was held on September 13, 2011, to replace him; Republican businessman Bob Turner defeated Democrat David Weprin to fill Weiner&#x27;s seat.

A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, which was several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race. Weiner sent explicit photos under an alias to a 22-year-old woman with whom he had contact as late as April 2013, which was more than a year after he had left Congress. The woman was later identified as Sydney Leathers.

On August 28, 2016, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Weiner had sexted another woman, including sending a picture while he was lying in bed with his young son. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the next day that Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin intended to separate. Abedin announced her intention by stating, &quot;After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.&quot;

In September 2016, claims were published that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident. The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner&#x27;s laptop was seized. Emails that were pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on the laptop; this prompted FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation eleven days before the 2016 US presidential election. Hillary Clinton said Comey&#x27;s decision was one of the reasons she lost the election to Donald Trump.

On January 31, 2017, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that federal prosecutors were weighing whether or not to bring child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident. On May 19, 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in its online edition that Weiner had surrendered to the FBI that morning. He pled guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. Under the agreement, Weiner faced a sentence of 21 to 27 months in federal prison and would be required to register as a sex offender. At his sentencing hearing on September 25, 2017, presiding judge Denise Cote sentenced Weiner to 21 months in prison, beginning on November 6, 2017, with an additional three years of supervision following his prison term.

On November 6, 2017, Weiner reported to Federal Medical Center, Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts to begin his 21-month sentence. After getting about three months deducted from his sentence for good behavior, Weiner was released from prison on February 17, 2019, and sent to a halfway house. Weiner was released from a Bronx halfway house on May 14, 2019. Weiner is registered as a sex offender.

== New York mayoral elections ==
=== 2005 ===
Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for New York City mayor in 2005, vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against &quot;passivity in City Hall&quot; and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better. He presented a book of 50 &quot;Real Solutions&quot; and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems. One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed &quot;Weiner&#x27;s Cleaners&quot;.

Weiner started out last in many polls, but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had Fernando Ferrer with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, had urged him to concede. Absentee ballots put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official primary election returns.

=== 2009 ===
Weiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009. However, in May 2009, after the New York City Council voted to extend term limits for Mayor Bloomberg, Weiner announced his decision not to run against the popular incumbent. By July 2010, Weiner had raised $3.9 million for a potential campaign in the 2013 mayoral election, and was considered a leading contender in early polls. According to the New York City Campaign Finance Board website, as of the March 2013 filing deadline Weiner had raised over $5.1 million, the second most among registered mayoral candidates, behind only Christine Quinn.

=== 2013 ===
In an interview with &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner said he would like to &quot;ask people to give me a second chance&quot; and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, &quot;it&#x27;s now or maybe never for me.&quot;

In an interview on April 11, Rep. Keith Ellison endorsed Weiner, saying that he would love to see him become mayor of New York. Weiner announced his intent to seek candidacy on a YouTube video on May 21, 2013.

Weiner&#x27;s platform for candidacy was summarized in &quot;Keys to the City: 64 Ideas to Keep New York City the Capital of the Middle Class&quot;.

After his resignation from Congress, Weiner used the alias &quot;Carlos Danger&quot; to continue to send explicit photographs. Following the second set of sexting allegations, he acknowledged on July 23, 2013, that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as “an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man”. Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, Huma Abedin, in which he announced that he would continue his campaign. At the press conference, Weiner said, &quot;I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.”

On July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner&#x27;s campaign chief, announced his resignation. On September 10, 2013, Weiner lost the mayoral primary, winning only 4.9% of the vote.

==Year 2024 and New York City Local Elections 2025==

In November 2024, Weiner announced that he is considering running for public office again. He is considering running against New York State Assemblyman Harvey Epstein and two other Democrats in The New York City Council District currently occupied by term limited member Carlina Rivera.

== Post-congressional private sector work ==
In July 2011 (less than a month after he left Congress), Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates. He advised over a dozen companies that included electronic medical records providers and biofuel firms. He worked with Covington &amp; Burling, an international law firm. According to 2012 public disclosures, his work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of lobbying. This was based on the so-called &quot;Daschle Loophole&quot; in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires only those who spend more than 20% of their time lobbying to register as lobbyists.

The Sunlight Foundation criticized Weiner for stealth lobbying and falling under the aforementioned &quot;Daschle Loophole&quot;. The public never learned of his lobbying work until two years later, when his nondisclosure agreements expired.

From July to September 2015, Weiner worked for MWW Group, a PR firm in New York City as a part-time consultant to serve on the company&#x27;s board of advisors.

On August 29, 2016, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said it would no longer carry Weiner&#x27;s columns, which included his writings on New York City politics. On the same day, television channel NY1 said Weiner would not be reprising his contributor role on any of its shows.

Weiner served as CEO of IceStone, a Brooklyn-based kitchen-countertop company. He left his role as CEO in August 2021, as the company transitioned to a worker-owned cooperative.

After leaving IceStone, he began working for WABC radio where he co-hosts a weekly live show with Curtis Sliwa and records a weekly podcast.

== Personal life ==
In 2009, Weiner became engaged to Huma Abedin, a long-time personal aide to Hillary Clinton, and they married in July 2010, with former president Bill Clinton officiating. Abedin is a practicing Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent. In December 2011, Abedin gave birth to a son.

In August 2016, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner. In early 2017, Abedin announced her intent to file for divorce with sole physical custody of their son. On May 19, 2017, after he pleaded guilty, she filed for divorce. Abedin and Weiner withdrew their divorce case from court in January 2018, saying they decided to settle the divorce privately in order to spare their six-year-old son further embarrassment. As of November 2021, their divorce was in its final stages, although they still see each other and raise their son.

Weiner is a lifelong fan of the New York Mets and New York Islanders.

== In popular culture ==
In 2013, Weiner and Abedin allowed filmmakers full access to his mayoral campaign. In 2016, the resulting documentary, &quot;Weiner&quot;, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

In 2013, a production called &quot;The Weiner Monologues&quot; premiered at the Access Theater. Directed by Jonathan Harper Schlieman, the show was based on media coverage of Weiner&#x27;s sexting scandal.

In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in an &quot;Alpha House&quot; episode.

<text>Burgas Airport is an international airport in southeast Bulgaria and the second largest in the country. It is near the northern neighbourhood of Sarafovo approximately from the city centre. The airport principally serves Burgas and other seaside resorts of the Bulgarian south coast which attract many tourists during the summer leisure season.

==History==
===Early years===
On 27 June 1937, the French company CIDNA (now part of Air France), chose the area of Burgas Airport to build a radio station and signed a contract with the Bulgarian government for its use. The contract expressly stated that the staff of Burgas Airport would be Bulgarian. 

On 29 June 1947, Balkan Bulgarian Airlines began domestic flights between Burgas, Plovdiv and Sofia, using Junkers Ju 52/3m aircraft. In the 1950s and 1960s, the airport was expanded and modernized by building a concrete runway. In 1970, the airport became an international airport serving 45 destinations.

===Development since the 2000s===
Burgas airport has been subject to heavy traffic following the growing tourism industry in Bulgaria and was in need of major investments to expand and handle projected passenger traffic. In June 2006, the Bulgarian Government awarded &quot;Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide&quot; a 40-year-long concession on both Varna and Burgas airports in return for investments exceeding €500 million.

Fraport entered into partnership with Varna-based company BM Star. The concessionaire has vowed to inject 403 million Euro in the two airports during the lifespan of the arrangement. Fraport will pay 60% of an investment of EUR 403 million over the 35-year concession. The investments will be made in new terminal facilities, vehicles and equipment and expanding apron areas at the airports over the life of the concession.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===
In December 2011, construction work began on the new Terminal 2. The new terminal was planned to have a capacity of 2,700,000 passengers and an area of . The new terminal building was designed so that it can be easily upgraded to further increase capacity, if necessary. Construction of the new terminal was completed in 2013, and has been operational since December 2013.

Terminal 2 replaced the older Terminal 1, which was built in the 1950s and expanded in the early 1990s, and now handles all of the airport&#x27;s passenger traffic. The terminal is equipped with 31 check-in counters, three boarding-card checkpoints, nine security lanes and eight departure gates. The arrivals area (divided into Schengen and non-Schengen zones) has 12 immigration stations and four baggage carousels (one long and three long carousels). Passenger amenities include of space dedicated to shopping and for food and beverage (F&amp;B) services. There is also a outdoor courtyard.

===Runway===
The runway is long.

On 31 October 2016, reconstruction and rehabilitation of taxiways began at Burgas airport. The project includes a complete rehabilitation of 3,500 square meters of taxiway &quot;H&quot;, complete rehabilitation of taxiway &quot;A&quot;, as well as area adjacent to the runway holding point. The control and monitoring system for airfield lighting and approach light equipment will be replaced. The total investment of Fraport Twin Star Airport Management in these projects is over BGN 12 million.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to Burgas Airport:

<text>The Rothley Brook is a left bank tributary of the River Soar in Leicestershire, England.

== Course ==

It first becomes noticeable after Thornton Reservoir, near the village of Thornton in the National Forest. It then flows through Desford and Ratby before being joined by a tributary from Kirby Muxloe just before Glenfield.

After Glenfield, it flows around Anstey, Cropston and Thurcaston before finally reaching Rothley where it joins the River Soar.

== History ==

It was previously known as &quot;Heathe Brook&quot;.

== Castle Hill Park ==
The Rothley Brook is one of the defining features of the large Castle Hill Country Park in Anstey and runs parallel to Cropston Road and the A46 as well as passing underneath Anstey Lane, Thurcaston.
The parts of the brook which flow through Castle Hill Park are a haven for wildlife, including kingfishers.

<doc id="963595" wikidata="Q1333596" url="?curid=963595" title="Petavius (crater)">
<text>Petavius is a large lunar impact crater located to the southeast of the Mare Fecunditatis, near the southeastern lunar limb. Attached to the northwest rim is the smaller crater Wrottesley. To the southeast are Palitzsch, Vallis Palitzsch, and Hase. Farther to the north is the large crater Vendelinus. Petavius appears oblong when viewed from the Earth due to foreshortening. Petavius is Imbrian in age.

The outer wall of Petavius is unusually wide in proportion to the diameter, and displays a double rim along the south and west sides. The height of the rim varies by as much as 50% from the lowest point, and a number of ridges radiate outwards from the rim. The convex crater floor has been resurfaced by lava flow, and displays a rille system named the Rimae Petavius. The large central mountains are a prominent formation with multiple peaks, climbing 1.7 kilometers above the floor. A deep fracture runs from the peaks toward the southwest rim of the crater.

Rev. T. W. Webb described Petavius as,

: &quot;one of the finest spots in the Moon: its grand double rampart, on east side nearly . High, its terraces, and convex interior with central hill and cleft, compose a magnificent landscape in the lunar morning or evening, entirely vanishing beneath a Sun risen but halfway to the meridian.&quot;

Petavius is one of the largest craters of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

The most favorable time for viewing this feature through a telescope is when the Moon is only three days old. By the fourth day the crater is nearly devoid of shadow.

70-cm radar images of this crater and its surroundings show that the region of the surface beyond the wide outer of Petavius has a dark halo, characteristic of a smooth surface free of boulders. It is thought that this may have been created by radial outbursts during the original impact that swept the area clean.

Petavius B to the north-northwest of Petavius has a small ray system that lies across the surface of Mare Fecunditatis. Due to these rays, Petavius B is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Petavius.

Although there is no railway service (did have one) to Cossington, the Ivanhoe Line runs along the Midland Main Line between Leicester and Loughborough, passing close to the village. An hourly service is provided in both directions as part of East Midlands Railway Local service from Lincoln to Leicester via Nottingham. Many years ago there was a &#x27;Cossington Gate railway station&#x27; which has long since gone, the only evidence remaining on old maps, The nearest stations now being at Syston and Sileby.

Cossington was once home to Lady Isobel Barnett, a radio and television personality from the mid 20th century, where she committed suicide amidst shoplifting charges. A short new road, Barnett Close, has been named in her memory.

The village is home to three small businesses; two garden centres (Derry&#x27;s Nursery and Goscote Nursery) and a pub, The Royal Oak

In the early 1990s there were plans to expand the village, which were strongly opposed by the residents at the time, who formed the protest group &#x27;Cossington In Distress&#x27;. The residents were successful in bringing about the cessation of the work and the village remains a peaceful community to this day.

Every alternate Easter the residents of Cossington open their gardens to the public for two days for the &#x27;Secret Gardens of Cossington&#x27; in which the village&#x27;s willing gardeners show off their talents, with all the proceeds of ticket sales going to charity. The event has been a massive success every time it has run.

The church of All Saints dates from the 13th century. A ‘Grant of Arms’ of the Fisher family displayed on the tower wall above the arch. There are memorial tablets to the Fisher family of which Geoffrey Fisher became Archbishop of Canterbury in the 1950s.

To the south of the village lies Platts Lane Recreation Ground (more simply known as just &#x27;Platts Lane&#x27;) which is owned by the Platts Lane Charitable Trust and run by a volunteer committee made up of mostly village residents. Platts Lane is basically a large playing field area and plays host to football, cricket and rugby matches - most notably being the home of Sileby Town Rugby Football Club who are also known as &#x27;The Vikings&#x27; and play all their home fixtures at Platts Lane, which many locals enjoy watching.

Nearby is Ratcliffe College.

A notable native of Cossington was John Webster, governor of Connecticut Colony in 1656. John Webster&#x27;s Great-great-great-grandson Noah Webster Jr Wrote what became the Merriam-Webster Dictionary around 1875

The Australian artist Grace Cossington Smith&#x27;s mother (also Grace, née Fisher) was the daughter of a rector of Cossington from the Fisher family (see above).

To the east of the village there is a footpath named &quot;Polly Peggs Footpath&quot;. Local village legend says a distressed girl drowned herself after falling pregnant whilst courting. Her lover, father and even the church abandoned her and she committed suicide.

<text>The Kongur Tagh (meaning &#x27;Brown Mountain&#x27; in English) is the highest peak in the Pamir Mountains, and also the highest mountain wholly within the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. With an elevation of , it is also the highest mountain outside of the Hindu Kush/Karakoram and Himalaya ranges.

==Geography==
Kongur Tagh is within a range called the Kongur Shan (.) Kongur Tagh is located just north of Muztagh Ata and visible from Karakul Lake. Some sources use &quot;Kongur Shan&quot; mistakenly to refer to the peak itself. The Kongur Shan range, including Muztagh Ata, is separated by the major Yarkand River valley from the Kunlun Mountains and thus is included in the &quot;Eastern Pamirs&quot;. Kongur Tagh is the highest peak in the Pamirs. Due to its remoteness and being hidden by nearby peaks, Kongur was not discovered by Europeans until 1900. However, the building of the Karakoram Highway from Pakistan to China, which runs past nearby Tashkurgan and Karakul Lake, has now made it more accessible.

Administratively, the Kongur Range is within Akto County.

==Climbing history==
The first ascent of Kongur Tagh was made in 1981 by a British expedition consisting of Chris Bonington, Alan Rouse, Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker.

==Elevation==
Kongur Tagh is high. Some sources list the peak&#x27;s elevation as , but this is likely incorrect. The main summit is close enough in height to the high northeastern summit that climbers standing on the main summit could not tell which was taller, thus it can not be high.

<text>At the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] in St. Moritz, four [[speed skating]] events were scheduled, all for men, but medals were only awarded for three events, because the 10.000 m event was not completed. The Allround event, which was only organized in 1924, was removed from the program. The competitions were held on Monday, 13 February 1928 and on Tuesday, 14 February 1928.

In the 10,000-meter race, Irving Jaffee was leading the competition, having outskated Norwegian defending world champion Bernt Evensen in their heat, when rising temperatures thawed the ice. In a controversial ruling, the Norwegian referee canceled the entire competition. Although the International Olympic Committee reversed the referee&#x27;s decision and awarded Jaffee the gold medal, the International Skating Union later overruled the IOC and restored the ruling. Evensen, for his part, publicly said that Jaffee should be awarded the gold medal, but that never happened.

<doc id="963618" wikidata="Q158285" url="?curid=963618" title="Diesel (company)">
<text>Diesel S.p.A. is retail brand headquartered in Breganze, Italy known for luxury denim which also vends clothing, footwear, and accessories. It is part of OTB Group.

Diesel USA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2019, and announced it would close some of its brick-and-mortar stores. Its parent company, Diesel SpA, was not part of the bankruptcy filing. 

Belgian designer Glenn Martens was appointed artistic director of Diesel in October 2020.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Diesel founder Renzo Rosso began stitching jeans on a sewing machine at the age of fifteen. He used his mother&#x27;s sewing machine to produce low-riding, bell bottomed jeans, which he would wear himself and sell to his friends for 3500 lire a piece. He later attended an industrial textile manufacturing high school in Padua.

In 1976 Rosso began working for a clothing manufacturer called Moltex, which was owned by Adriano Goldschmied. After working with the company for two years, he used a loan from his father to buy a 40% holding in the company, which changed its name to Diesel, and marketed jeans under the Diesel brand and many others. Rosso bought out Goldschmied&#x27;s interest in the Diesel brand name in 1985 for US$500,000, becoming the sole owner of the company. Rosso has said that he learned marketing from the US, creativity from Italy, and systems from Germany.

===1990s===
During the first part of the 1990s, Rosso pioneered Diesel into the fashion world and set the grounds for its establishment in global markets. In 1990, Russ Togs, Inc. received the license to market and distribute Diesel lines in the United States and Mexico. By 1991, Russ Togs was going out of business, and sold Diesel Sportswear to Rosso upon ending the licensing deal. As a result of Russ Togs collapse, the creation of made in the USA Diesel products never came to fruition, and Diesel instead placed its made-in-Italy jeans and clothing in US stores.

====Pierre Winther’s Artistic Collaboration with Diesel Jeans====

In 1993, Diesel hired Pierre Winther to redefine its visual identity and brand image. Collaborating with Diesel’s headquarters and the Stockholm-based agency Paradiset, Winther created the new groundbreaking &quot;Successful Living&quot; campaigns. His work featured complex, staged scenarios, such as a dramatic car crash and a surreal church event, which broke the mold of traditional advertising. These provocative and visually arresting images created a global sensation. Consumers eagerly collected the campaign’s posters and materials, elevating Diesel&#x27;s brand image and solidifying its position as one of the leading denim brands worldwide.

Winther&#x27;s photograph famous Car Crash 1993 and House of love 1994 stands as one of the most iconic and recognized images in advertising history. The image, part of Diesel’s revolutionary campaigns, pushed the boundaries of fashion marketing with its bold storytelling and striking visuals. It gained further acclaim when featured in an exhibition at Fotografiska Museum in Stockholm, which ran from November 18, 2016, to February 12, 2017. The exhibition highlighted controversial and influential Diesel advertising images, celebrating the brand&#x27;s ability to challenge societal norms through unconventional and provocative visuals. Pierre Winther stated, “I created a world providing profound social messages that offered ethical, political, and even philosophical discourse in a strong, colorful, Fellini-like world. I depicted these themes in a more contemporary way that, to this day, provokes both a grimace and a grin.” Winther’s collaboration marked a quantum leap for Diesel, cementing its reputation as a bold, innovative force in the global fashion industry.

In 1991, the company launched its first international marketing effort with the highly successful &#x27;Guides for Successful Living&#x27; campaign series. The campaign won a Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the world&#x27;s leading awards in advertising, in 1992. In the same year, Diesel also became the title sponsor for the World Superbike racing circuit. Diesel continued to ignore common marketing rules and began to establish itself as a major brand in the global fashion market. This was a result of Rosso&#x27;s ambition to always break new grounds and his aspiration to work with most creative agencies and photographers around, including Pierre Winther, David LaChapelle, Terry Richardson, Ellen von Unwerth, Rankin, and Erwin Olaf.

Later in 1995, the company launched one of its most popular yet provocative campaigns ever, featuring two kissing sailors staged at the peace celebration of World War II. Shot by photographer David LaChapelle, it was the first major public advertisement to show a homosexual couple kissing and was published at height of the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, Don&#x27;t tell&quot; debates in the US, which had led the U.S. Government to refuse entry to military service for openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons. At the same time, Diesel launched one of the first significant fashion retail websites, which housed images of each of its collections. The first Diesel jeans to be sold online were available in Finland and Sweden starting in 1997. It then opened a virtual store that allowed home delivery for further markets the following year.
In 1999, Diesel opened large flagship stores in New York City, San Francisco, Rome, and London, and began to open other mono-brand stores for Diesel in order to augment its points of sale in department and other multi-brand retails stores. Further flagship stores (also known as &quot;StyleLabs&quot;) opened, including stores in Berlin, Barcelona, and Paris. Diesel also produces illustrated catalogs for its retail lines. The company also won the Premio Risultati award for Best Italian Company of the Year from the Bocconi Institute in 1996. In 1998 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called Diesel &quot;the label of the moment&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
Throughout the 2000s, Rosso increased Diesel&#x27;s share in the global fashion market, mainly through opening more company owned stores, embarking on a series of brand collaborations, and by expanding on the business of Diesel. Diesel founder Rosso also began purchasing additional fashion companies in 2002, under the parent company Only The Brave (OTB), which Diesel was brought under as well. Companies purchased by Only the Brave included Maison Martin Margiela, Viktor &amp; Rolf, Marni, and licensing company Staff International. In 2005 Diesel released the book &quot;Fifty&quot; upon Rosso&#x27;s fiftieth birthday, an illustrated history of the company, with a print-run of ten thousand.

Diesel&#x27;s headquarters are in Breganze, on the former Moto Laverda factory area, and had twelve international subsidiaries as of 2005. As of 2008, the company had five thousand points of sale across eighty countries, with 270 mono-brand Diesel stores. Diesel itself owns 170 of those, with the rest owned by franchisees. Turnover was over €1.3 billion in 2009, and by 2010 the company had over 400 stores. In 2012 Diesel founder Rosso was listed on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of billionaires for the first time. In 2015 the company held the exhibition Welcome to Diesel World in Shanghai, which provided an overview of the company&#x27;s history, in conjunction with its collection debut. Another exhibition was held in Tel Aviv to mark the company&#x27;s twentieth year in Israel.

In the spring of 2013, Rosso named Nicola Formichetti, the former stylist of Lady Gaga and creative director of Mugler, as Diesel&#x27;s Artistic Director. The announcement followed days of speculation and was met with positive response across the fashion world and daily news press. In an interview with &quot;V&quot; magazine following the announcement, Rosso said &quot;I finally met somebody as crazy as I am&quot;, and explained that Formichetti&#x27;s new responsibilities will be overseeing &quot;the total view&quot; of Diesel&#x27;s brand, including product, communications, marketing and interior design. Formichetti&#x27;s first project&#x27;s included launching a groundbreaking crowd-funded advertising campaign with Tumblr. The campaign, titled #Reboot and shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, featured prominent, young creatives ranging from graffiti artists to film students instead of common models, with varying body shapes, sizes and personal styles.

=== 2020&#x27;s ===
Belgian designer Glenn Martens was appointed artistic director of Diesel in October 2020. 2021 direct e-commerce sales for Diesel saw a 34% rise compared to 2019 figures, attributable to Martens work. The Diesel Fall/Winter 2022 Ready-to-Wear fashion show, designed by him and held on 23 February 2022 in Milan, got mostly positive coverage. It was deemed as a &quot;magical and fantastic&quot; show with &quot;big ambitions&quot; and an &quot;out of this world&quot; vibe, while other reviewers appreciated that the &quot;collection’s inspirations spanned decades&quot;, although the high-heeled boots proved tricky to walk in as one model was led off the runway by a member of the technical crew after having repeatedly tripped.

==Collaborations &amp; partnerships==
In 2002, Rosso was asked to collaborate with Karl Lagerfeld on a denim collection for the designer&#x27;s Lagerfeld Gallery. The collection, which was called Lagerfeld Gallery by Diesel, was co-designed by Lagerfeld and then developed by Diesel&#x27;s Creative Team. It consisted of five pieces that were presented during the designer&#x27;s catwalk shows during Paris Fashion Week and then sold in very limited editions at the Lagerfeld Galleries Stores in Paris and Monaco, and at the Diesel Denim Galleries in New York City and Tokyo. During the first week of sales in New York, more than 90% of the trousers were sold out, even though prices ranged from as high as $240 to $1840. In a statement after the show in Paris, Rosso said &quot;I am honored to have met this fashion icon of our time. Karl represents creativity, tradition and challenge, and the fact that he thought of Diesel for this collaboration is a great gift and acknowledgement of our reputation as the prêt-à-porter of casual wear.&quot;

In 2003, Rosso asked legendary street and graffiti artist Stephen Sprouse to take over Diesel&#x27;s Union Square store for New York Fashion Week the following September. As part of the collaboration Sprouse designed a series of limited edition jeans, T-shirts and hats, and made a complete makeover of the Diesel store, which meant adding his renowned Day-Glo design to windows, interiors, and outer building exteriors.

Also in 2003, Diesel partnered with video game production company Capcom to create unique costumes for the playable characters in the game &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot;.

In 2007, Rosso and Diesel partnered with L&#x27;Oréal for the production of Diesel&#x27;s first fragrance, labelled Fuel For Life. This was followed by a partnership with Italian carmaker FIAT in early 2008 to re-design the classic Fiat 500. Originally one of FIAT&#x27;s most popular models ever, the new version, simply titled &#x27;500 by Diesel&#x27;, featured several unique design details in the car&#x27;s interior and exterior and was only produced in 10,000 units.

In the spring of 2008, Rosso launched a collaboration between Diesel and sportswear giant Adidas. After Diesel made a special denim collection for Adidas that was exclusively available at Adidas Originals stores, called Adidas Originals by Diesel, the collaboration then developed into Adidas making special sneakers called Forum Mid Diesel Lea, Forum Mid Diesel Txt, ZX 700 Diesel, Stan Smith Special, Stan Smith 80&#x27;s Diesel - available in Diesel stores worldwide.

In May 2011, Rosso launched the first ever Diesel bicycle, together with award-winning bicycle manufacturer Pinarello. Built as a single-speed, city bicycle with a hydro formed aluminum frame, the collaboration marked one of the first true collaborations between the bicycle and the fashion industry.

==Fashion lines==

While the most popular Diesel apparel item has been denim wear, the company has expanded to include additional forms of clothing. The company has created leather jackets, women&#x27;s dresses, and other items. In 1998, Diesel founded an offshoot label called Diesel StyleLab, which produced higher end fashion designs beyond more traditional denim jeans. In the 2000s, the company began to license its brand to other retail manufacturers, in order to create new product categories. These lines included the sunglasses line Diesel Eyewear in partnership with Marcolin, the jewels and watches line Diesel Watches in partnership with Fossil, the fragrance line in partnership with L&#x27;Oréal. The production of each line involves supervision from Diesel itself. Diesel has also partnered with Moroso, Seletti, Scavolini, Foscarini, and Berti to create a home furnishings line called Diesel Living, with Bugaboo to create strollers, with AVG to create helmets, with Ducati, and with Fiat to create a limited edition Fiat 500. Diesel also produces limited edition lines of jeans.

As of 2003, according to Women&#x27;s Wear Daily, Diesel had three distinct fashion lines, &quot;Diesel Style Lab, the most pricey fashion-forward designer label; Diesel, a fashion brand that still focuses heavily on denim, and 55DSL, the board sport-inspired streetwear line that blends fashion and function.&quot; Style Lab and 55DSL are now defunct.

From 2008 to 2018, there were two lines: Diesel and Diesel Black Gold. Diesel Black Gold was the luxury ready-to-wear line and was launched in 2008 during the New York Fashion Week. The line elevated Diesel&#x27;s denim expertise by introducing elements of tailoring. Diesel Black Gold was positioned as a casual alternative to other luxury brands. In 2013 Diesel underwent a re-branding effort, reorganizing both the business structure and marketing methodologies.

As of 2023, Diesel does not have any diffusion lines or sub-brands.
==Advertising==

Starting in 1991, Diesel has been known for producing ads that invoke surreal images in lieu of direct product details, in partnership with Swedish ad agency Paradiset DDB, Stockholm. These included 1997 ads portraying life in Communist North Korea (shot in Hong Kong). Another ad campaign imitated automobile crashes. Campaigns have also used social consciousness as a theme, ironic plays on global issues (such as their Global Warming Ready campaign featuring post-global warming backdrops in global locations), as well as anti-establishment messages. Michael Chevalier has critiqued the retail stores, stating that he believes that the stores&#x27;s merchandise is presented in a confusing way in order to get customers to interact with the sales staff.
During the late 1990s, Diesel produced CD-ROMs and other computer content, including the computer game &quot;Digital Adrenalin—55DSL&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Diesel began to implement a mindset into their global marketing strategy that &quot;put sales and profit second to building something special for customers, often by creating interactive user experiences that are not directly connected to retail, sales or stores.&quot; In a research study of innovative businesses presented by &quot;The Times&quot;, much of Diesel&#x27;s successful growth in the early 2000s was accredited to this mindset. The study concluded that &quot;Diesel is an experience which interacts with and entertains its customers with a far deeper relationship than other brands&quot;, and that &quot;It is always about engaging with the customer as opposed to selling at them: creating an enjoyable two-way dialogue as opposed to a hollow one-way monologue.&quot;

In 2007, Diesel sponsored a music contest, Diesel-U-Music. From January to September 2008, Diesel spent $5.8 million on U.S. advertising, according to TNS Media Intelligence.

This approach took another step, leading to the infamous &#x27;Heidies&#x27;. which mocked the phenomenon of reality TV and was one of the first ever campaigns by a fashion brand solely based on the Internet. It featured two models that were locked inside a room and who did whatever the online viewers suggested. The models played two mentally crazy women who, wanting to claim their 15 minutes of fame, had taken an intimate Diesel sales guy as hostage, closed themselves up in a hotel room and hijacked the company&#x27;s website; requesting that they be selected for the next Diesel advertising campaign. The employee was said to work for Diesel Intimate, as the campaign was in fact the launch for the brand&#x27;s new line of intimate and beachwear. The campaign became a huge success, and reached over 100,000 views daily while it was live. It was awarded at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival that same year.

On October 11, 2008, Diesel celebrated the company&#x27;s 30th anniversary hosting 17 parties around the world all broadcast live online spanning across 24 hours. Following the opening in Tokyo, the live stream continued to Beijing, Dubai, Athens, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Milan, Zurich, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Oslo, London, São Paulo and finally ended in New York City, with Rosso&#x27;s attendance. The event featured live performances by Daft Punk, Earth Wind and Fire, 2manydjs, Mark Ronson, New Young Pony Club, and a pregnant MIA who broke her retirement for the occasion. In addition there were never seen before mash-ups with Chaka Khan feat. Franz Ferdinand and N.E.R.D. feat. Hot Chip.

The event was advertised through the release of a video titled &#x27;Diesel SFW XXX Party Video&#x27;, which immediately went viral and spread rapidly across the Internet, mostly due to its ironic take on 1980s style pornography. By 2011 it had been viewed more than 20 million times online and classified as one of the most successful viral campaigns ever. Additionally, the anniversary event also featured the production of a limited edition pair of jeans, called &#x27;The Dirty Thirty&#x27;. The denim, which were for sale for one day only (on the date of the birth of the brand) at the extremely discounted price of €30 and modeled by Daisy Lowe, caused &#x27;hysteria&#x27; and lead consumers to form mile-long lines outside Diesel stores around the world. These jeans were sold out within just a few hours worldwide.

Throughout the 2000s Rosso and the Diesel Creative Team also continued working with a number of famous photographers and agencies, including Jean Pierre Khazem, Carl de Keyzer, Finlay McKay, Elaine Constantine, Mert Alas &amp; Marcus Piggott, Louis Sebastian Pane, Johan Renck, and Terry Richardson, the latter for the celebrated &quot;Global Warming Ready&quot; campaign of 2007. In 2001, 2007, 2009, and 2010 Diesel was given Grand Prix awards at Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.

There is a Diesel Art Gallery in Tokyo. In 2009 the head of Diesel&#x27;s US division, Steve Birkhold, left the company shortly after agreeing a deal to sell cut-priced jeans through Macy&#x27;s.

==Talent support==
In the early 2000s, Rosso pushed Diesel to start reinvesting part of the company&#x27;s marketing budgets into the creative community, by financially supporting young, creative talent. This led to Diesel initiating projects like Diesel:U:Music Radio, Diesel New Art and Diesel Wall and become a founding partner of ITS (International Talent Support). Furthermore, the company also helped launch Pocko&#x27;s affordable art books in 1999, and for a number of years sponsored projects like Online Flash Film Fest and Semi-Permanent.

In 2001, Diesel:U:Music Radio was founded with a vision to support unsigned bands and as a reaction to an overly commercialized music industry. Consisting of an independent jury with artists and producers such as Ian McCulloch, Mark Ronson, and Ronnie Wood, the jury annually reviewed thousands of demos from around the world and selected winning, unsigned bands. By partnering with record labels like Warner Music or media publishers like &quot;Vice&quot;, the winning artists were offered records deals and media publicity. In 2006, the project was broadcast live on Channel 4 in Great Britain and featured legendary avant-garde rock band Roxy Music. In 2009, the project included a global tour and radio station. The tour featured live performances by artists like Kanye West and The Roots, who supported the competition&#x27;s winning younger bands, The Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt! and HEARTSREVOLUTION. Produced in London, the Diesel:U:Music radio station was hailed by The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph for its unique quality programming, and had shows hosted by everyone from Grandmaster Flash to Franz Ferdinand. In an interview with &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot;, Rosso explained the purpose of the project, stating that &quot;It&#x27;s about giving people the tools and seeing them succeed and excel in their creativity&quot;. Through its 10-year history, the Diesel:U:Music winners included Diplo, Mylo, DJ Yoda and The Cool Kids.

In 2002 Rosso and Diesel became founding partners of ITS (International Talent Support), a competition for young designers. While Rosso has often been a member of the jury, Diesel and the OTB, its parent company, sponsored the competition financially. In 2005, the founder of &quot;i-D Magazine&quot;, Terry Jones, credited ITS for &quot;dedicating so much passion and commitment to the selection of designers, like no other organization&quot;.

In 2003 and 2004, Diesel began supporting local, young artists through the Diesel New Art and Diesel Wall competitions. Diesel New Art was open to graduating artists working across various media, and would award-winning artists with solo exhibitions, shows at international art fairs, or promotion through internationally published catalogues. For Diesel Wall Diesel purchased large, unused facades in major cities and transformed them into popular exhibition spaces. Winning artworks were selected by an independent jury, and displayed on the walls for a longer period of time throughout the year. During the years a few of the jury members have included curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, film director Bigas Luna, art director and graphic designer Peter Saville, artist Patrick Tuttofuoco, art director Jérôme Sans and editors Helena Kontova and Stefano Boeri.

Founded in 1989, ANDAM (National Association for the Development of the Fashion Arts) seeks, in the words of Pierre Bergé, &quot;to identify emerging talents in contemporary fashion design and offer them the means to exist, to produce a runway show during Paris Fashion Week, and to establish and develop their label in France, thus perpetuating the dynamism of the Parisian fashion scene.&quot; Thanks to its sponsors (Fondation Pierre Bergé, Galeries Lafayette, Google, Hermés, Kering, Lacoste, Longchamp, LMVH, OBO, OTB, Premiere Classe, Saint Laurent, Swarowski, Tomorrow), as well as of two public institutions, the DEFI and the French Ministry of Culture and Communication, ANDAM is the largest international fashion prize, a driving force in the development of new fashion designers in France. Renzo Rosso, was the mentor of the 2013 and 2019 ANDAM finalists. In addition to the financial endowment of the prize, the winners benefited from the strategic, creative and commercial coaching of a worldwide fashion industry entrepreneur, helping the winners develop their label and build an international reputation.

==Trademark dispute==
In late 1979 or early 1980, an Irish-based company, Montex, began producing jeans bearing the brand Diesel. In 1982, Diesel SpA began selling jeans under its Diesel brand in Ireland.

In 1992, Montex applied to register the Diesel trademark in Ireland. Their application was opposed by Diesel SpA. In 1994, Diesel SpA applied to register the Diesel trademark in Ireland. Their application was opposed by Montex. In 2001, the Irish Supreme Court refused to allow Montex to register the trademark. In 2012, the Irish Controller of Patents Designs and Trademarks refused to allow Diesel SpA to register the trademark. In 2024, the Irish High Court ruled that Diesel SpA was entitled to register the Diesel trademark in Ireland. This decision is open to appeal.

<text>An incremental compiler is a kind of incremental computation applied to the field of compilation. Quite naturally, whereas ordinary compilers make a so-called clean build, that is, (re)build all program modules, an incremental compiler recompiles only modified portions of a program.

==Definition==

===Imperative programming===
In imperative programming and software development, incremental compilation takes only the &quot;changes&quot; of a known set of source files and &quot;updates&quot; any corresponding output files (in the compiler&#x27;s target language, often bytecode) that may already exist from previous compilations.
By effectively &quot;building upon&quot; previously compiled output files, an incremental compiler avoids the wasteful recompiling of entire source files, where most of the code remains unchanged. For most incremental compilers, compiling a program with small changes to its source code is usually near instantaneous.
It can be said that an incremental compiler reduces the granularity of a language&#x27;s traditional compiling units while maintaining the language&#x27;s semantics, such that the compiler can append and replace smaller parts.

Many programming tools take advantage of incremental compilers to provide developers with a much more interactive programming environment. It is not unusual that an incremental compiler is invoked for &quot;every&quot; change of a source file, such that the developer is almost immediately informed about any compilation errors that would arise as a result of their changes to the code. This scheme, in contrast with traditional compilation, shortens a programmer&#x27;s development cycle significantly, because they would no longer have to wait for a long compile process before being informed of errors.

One downside to this type of incremental compiler is that it cannot easily optimize the code that it compiles, due to locality and the limited scope of what is changed. This is usually not a problem, because for optimization is usually only carried out on release, an incremental compiler would be used throughout development, and a standard batch compiler would be used on release.

===Interactive programming===
In the interactive programming paradigm, e.g. in Poplog related literature, and an interactive compiler refers to a compiler that is actually a part of the runtime system of the source language. The compiler can be invoked at runtime on some source code or data structure managed by the program, which then produces a new compiled program fragment containing machine code that is then immediately available for use by the runtime system. If the newly compiled fragment replaces a previous compiled procedure the old one will be garbage collected. This scheme allows for a degree of self-modifying code and requires metaprogramming language features. The ability to add, remove and delete code while running is known as hot swapping. Some interactive programming platforms mix the use of interpreted and compiled code to achieve the illusion that any changes to code are accessible by the program immediately.

<doc id="963626" wikidata="Q546932" url="?curid=963626" title="Ciro Rodriguez">
<text>Ciro Davis Rodriguez (born December 9, 1946) is an American politician and social worker who served as a U.S. Representative for , serving from 2007 until 2011. The district stretched from El Paso in the west to San Antonio in the east, a distance of some . A member of the Democratic Party, he previously represented the neighboring 28th congressional district from 1997 to 2005, and was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1987 to 1997. 

He served as a justice of the peace for Bexar County from 2015 to 2021.

==Early life, education and career ==
Rodriguez was born in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico, but was raised and received his education in San Antonio, Texas. When he was young, his mother died suddenly and he dropped out of school. After working at a gas station for a year, he decided to go back to school and attended two different summer schools to catch up. He graduated with his entering class from Harlandale High School and then briefly attended San Antonio College, but subsequently graduated from St. Mary’s University with a B.A. in Political Science. He received his Master of Social Work from Our Lady of the Lake University.

From 1975 to 1987, he served as a board member of the Harlandale Independent School District, working as an educational consultant for the Intercultural Development Research Association and serving as a caseworker with the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. From 1987 to 1996, he taught at Our Lady of the Lake University&#x27;s Worden School of Social Service, the oldest school of Social Work in Texas.

After leaving Congress in January 2005, he joined with his former chief of staff, Jeff Mendelsohn, to create Rio Strategy Group LLC, a boutique government relations firm to assist clients at the local, state and national levels.

==Texas House of Representatives==
Rodriguez served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1987 to 1997. He chaired the important Local and Consent Calendar Committee, served on the Public Health and the Higher Education Committees, and presided as a vice chairman of the Legislative Study Group. He drafted legislation to allow students to earn college credit while they were in still in high school and the law that guaranteed the top ten percent of graduating students a place at a Texas four-year university.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1997–2005, 2007–2011)==
In January 1997, 28th District congressman Frank Tejeda died at the start of his third term. A special election to fill the remainder of his service was held in April, resulting in Rodriguez defeating his nearest rival Juan F. Solis III with 66.7% of the vote.

After being sworn in on April 12, Rodriguez served as a member of the Armed Services, Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Resources Committees. He was also the ranking member of the VA Subcommittee on Health. Additionally, he led the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as chairman from 2003 to 2004 after four years as its Health Care Task Force Chairman.

He was also involved in military base creation and redevelopment and drafted legislation creating the Brooks City-Base; he also promoted the transformation of the former Kelly Air Force Base into Kelly USA, a maintenance and logistics center.

Rodriguez was the lead sponsor of the Hispanic Health Improvement Act.

In his capacity in Congress from 2006–2011, Congressman Rodriguez led as a champion of Veterans, farmers, law enforcement, and border security for the people of the 23rd District. He made sure the University of Texas at San Antonio had the funds to build a department for the development of Homeland Security, Veterans&#x27; received the benefits they deserved, the border was secure from the violence in Mexico, and secured funds for the agriculture community that consists of farmers, Texas A&amp;M University, and Sul Ross State University research programs.

In July 2011, Congressman Rodriguez celebrated with El Paso County officials the groundbreaking of the Tornillo Port of Entry. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee in the 2009–10 legislative session, Congressman Rodriguez was able to secure the $97 million to build the port of entry while also securing funds for new Veterans&#x27; Clinics in Del Rio, South San Antonio, and Uvalde.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Homeland Security
**Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch
**Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
*United States House Committee on Veterans Affairs
**United States House Veterans&#x27; Affairs Subcommittee on Health
**United States House Veterans&#x27; Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs

===Caucuses===
*Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), Chair of the Taskforce on Agriculture and Rural Communities

Rodriguez voted against both President Bush&#x27;s and Obama&#x27;s TARP/bank bailouts. He also voted against the General Motors bailout. Rodriguez did support the Stimulus plan, Health Care Reform and Financial Regulation of Wall Street. He helped pass the largest increase in veteran’s health care funding and the Wounded Warrior Act, reducing red tape for veterans in need. See: The Voter&#x27;s Self Defense System He has also focused on national security issues including cyber-security.

==Political campaigns==

===2004===

The 2003 Texas redistricting shifted most of heavily Democratic Laredo, previously one of the bases of the 23rd District, into the already heavily Democratic 28th. Laredo is the base of former Texas Secretary of State Henry Cuellar, a somewhat more conservative Democrat than Rodriguez. A year earlier, Cuellar had given the 23rd&#x27;s five-term Republican incumbent, Henry Bonilla, his closest race ever.

By moving most of Laredo to the 28th, the Republican-controlled legislature hoped to protect Bonilla by packing the 28th with as many Democrats as possible. In March 2004, Rodriguez lost the primary election, the real contest in this district, to Cuellar by 58 votes. Rodriguez sued to overturn Cuellar&#x27;s victory, but the Texas 4th Court of Appeals ruled against him.

===2006===
====28th district====
Rodriguez tried to regain his old House seat in 2006. His campaign was under-financed, but gained significant momentum after a photographer with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; snapped a photo of Cuellar at the 2006 State of the Union address, on the Republican side of the aisle, smiling as President George W. Bush affectionately grabbed his face. Rodriguez lost the March 7 Democratic primary with 40% of the vote to Cuellar&#x27;s 53%.

====23rd district====
In June, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Texas Legislature had violated the Voting Rights Act when it drew most of Laredo out of the 23rd and replaced it with several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs. A three-judge panel then drew new district lines. The new 23rd included Rodriguez&#x27;s home, along with much of his old south San Antonio base. That area had been part of the 23rd from its creation in 1967 to 1993.

On August 10 Rodriguez announced that he would run against Bonilla in the 23rd. The two opponents, original Democratic nominee Rick Bolanos, four other Democrats and one independent, faced one another in an all-candidate (or &quot;jungle&quot;) primary on November 7. Incumbent Bonilla emerged with 48.1% of the vote, and Ciro Rodriguez with 20.3%.

In the runoff election, Rodriguez defeated Bonilla 54% to 46% in an upset victory. This made Rodriguez&#x27;s district the 30th Democratic pickup in the 2006 House elections, and the second from Texas, after Nick Lampson. He also regained a seat after being defeated in another district in 2004, like Lampson. It was only the second time a Republican congressional incumbent had lost to a Democratic challenger in Texas since 1988 (the first time being Nick Lampson&#x27;s defeat of a Republican incumbent in 1996). Lampson served with Rodriguez again in 2007–2009, until he was defeated for the second time in 2008.

===2008===

Rodriguez won against Republican nominee Bexar County Commissioner Lyle Larson and Libertarian Lani Connolly.

===2010===

Rodriguez was challenged by Republican nominee Quico Canseco, Libertarian nominee Martin Nitschke, Green Party nominee Ed Scharf, and Independent Craig T. Stephens. The election was targeted by the Republican National Committee, which poured money in to support Canseco in an attempt to gain the seat for their party.

Rodriguez was defeated by Canseco, winning 44% to Canseco&#x27;s 49%.

===2012===

Ciro Rodriguez announced in early summer 2011 that he would seek election to his former seat in the U.S. Congress in a rematch against Rep. Quico Canseco. But, on November 29, 2011, Rodriguez announced he would campaign for election in the newly drawn, neighboring 35th District, which takes in eastern San Antonio, as well as portions of Atascosa, Comal and Hays counties. After courts changed the redistricting map again, however, Rodriguez returned to running in the 23rd district. He lost to State Rep. Pete Gallego in the Democratic Party primary runoff.

== Later career ==
Rodriguez successfully ran for Justice of the Peace in Bexar County Precinct 1, Place 2 in 2014. He was unopposed in both the primary and the general election. His term of office began January 1, 2015 and he served until October 2021.

==Personal life==
Rodriguez and his wife, Carolina Peña, have been married for thirty-five years.

<doc id="963630" wikidata="Q1661075" url="?curid=963630" title="Riccioli (crater)">
<text>Riccioli is a lunar impact crater located near the western limb of the Moon. It lies just to the northwest of a larger crater, Grimaldi. To the southwest are the craters Hartwig and Schlüter that lie on the northeastern edge of Montes Cordillera, a ring-shaped range that surrounds Mare Orientale. Due to its location, Riccioli appears strongly foreshortened from the earth and is viewed almost from the side.

Riccioli is older than the Orientale basin to the southwest because the ejecta from the impact that created the Orientale basin overlies the crater. This debris lies in ridges that regionally trend northeast–southwest, but trend in a direction parallel to Riccioli&#x27;s northeast wall in that part of the crater. A system of rilles named the Rimae Riccioli lies across the interior, and crosscut the ejecta ridges. In the northern half of the interior, the dark covering of lava that resurfaced the floor is visible, and covers some of the ejecta ridges and floods some of the rilles.

The crater is named after Giovanni Battista Riccioli, an Italian Jesuit astronomer who introduced the system of lunar nomenclature that is still in use today. He was also the first person to measure the rate of acceleration of a freely-falling body.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Riccioli.

<doc id="963635" wikidata="Q5187994" url="?curid=963635" title="Cropston Reservoir">
<text>Cropston Reservoir (originally known as Bradgate Reservoir) lies in Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, England. The dam and associated water works are in Cropston, while the bulk of the reservoir is in the neighbouring Newtown Linford parish. It was opened in May 1871 in a corner of Bradgate Park, a large expanse of open land northwest of Leicester. It is part of the Bradgate Park and Cropston Reservoir Site of Special Scientific Interest.

London-based consulting engineer Thomas Hawksley was appointed by Leicester Water Works in 1865 to carry out the surveying work. In September 1867, of land adjacent to the deer park at Bradgate Park was purchased from the Earl of Stamford for a cost of £24,000. A stone wall was built by George Rudkin around the boundary to separate the deer park from the reservoir, at a cost of 8s 10d per yard. The dam is long and rises to a height of at its highest point, which gives a depth of water of . The cost of the dam was £41,356 and the reservoir £8,500 with the contract being awarded to Benton &amp; Woodiwiss of Derby. The reservoir was completed in 1870. The dam was originally constructed from a mixture of siliceous sand and clay, but as water was found to be leaking through it, it was rebuilt and now extends below the surface. Water from the reservoir was piped to four large filter beds. It was then pumped to an elevation matching the supply from Thornton Reservoir so that the supplies from the two reservoirs could be merged.

The reservoir is formed by the River Lin and is owned and managed by Severn Trent. The growing population of Leicester and surrounding areas meant that by the late 19th century the reservoirs in Leicestershire were no longer adequate to meet demand, and water is now piped from Ladybower Reservoir to Cropston.

<doc id="963637" wikidata="Q554780" url="?curid=963637" title="Rhys Chatham">
<text>Rhys Chatham (born September 19, 1952) is an American composer, guitarist, trumpet player, multi-instrumentalist (flutes in C, alto and bass, keyboard), primarily active in avant-garde and minimalist music. He is best known for his &quot;guitar orchestra&quot; compositions. He has lived in France since 1987.

== Early years ==
Chatham began his musical career as a piano tuner for avant-garde Minimalist composer La Monte Young as well as harpsichord tuner for Gustav Leonhardt, Rosalyn Tureck and Glenn Gould. He studied flute under Sue Ann Kahn, with whom he first encountered contemporary classical music, and studied soon afterwards under electronic music pioneer Morton Subotnick and minimalist icon La Monte Young. He was a member of Young&#x27;s avant-garde group, &quot;Theatre of Eternal Music&quot; during the early seventies. Chatham also played with Tony Conrad in an early version of Conrad&#x27;s group, &quot;The Dream Syndicate&quot;. In 1971, while still in his teens, Chatham became the first music director at the experimental art space The Kitchen in lower Manhattan. His early musical work, such as &quot;Two Gongs&quot; (1971) owes a significant debt to La Monte Young and other minimalists such as Terry Riley and Philip Glass.

== Compositions from the late 1970s and early 1980s ==
By 1977, Chatham&#x27;s music was heavily influenced by punk rock, having seen an early Ramones concert. He formed the No Wave groups Tone Death (that performed early versions of his &quot;Guitar Trio&quot;) and The Gynecologists after being intrigued and influenced by the group of artists that music critics would label No Wave in 1978. That year, he began performing &quot;Guitar Trio&quot; around downtown Manhattan with an ensemble that included Glenn Branca, as well as Nina Canal of Ut. During this period, he wrote several works for large guitar ensembles, including &quot;Drastic Classicism&quot;, a collaboration with dancer Karole Armitage. &quot;Drastic Classicism&quot; was first released in 1982 on the compilation &quot;New Music from Antarctica&quot;, put together by Kit Fitzgerald, John Sanborn and Peter Laurence Gordon. It was also included on the 1987 album that also included his 1982 composition &quot;Die Donnergötter&quot; (German for &quot;The Thundergods&quot;).

In 1978, Artists Space served as a site of inception for the No Wave movement, hosting a five night underground No Wave music festival, organized by artists Michael Zwack and Robert Longo, that featured ten local bands; including Chatham&#x27;s The Gynecologists and Tone Death.

Members of the New York City noise rock band Band of Susans began their careers in Chatham&#x27;s ensembles; they later performed a cover of Chatham&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Trio&quot; on their 1991 album, &quot;The Word and the Flesh&quot;. (This parallels the way that members of fellow NYC noise rockers Sonic Youth began their careers in Branca&#x27;s ensembles; Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth did play with Chatham as well.)

Chatham began playing trumpet in 1983, studying under Carmine Curuso and Andrew Crocker, and his more recent works explore an early minimalist vocabulary employing loop and delay techniques for trumpet; these are performed by Chatham himself. Examples of this work can be heard on the album &quot;Outdoor Spell&quot;, released by Northern Spy in 2011, and a recent duo album with Charlemagne Palestine, entitled &quot;Youuu + Mee = Weee&quot;, released on the Belgium SubRosa Label in 2014.

== Recent activity ==
In 2002, he enjoyed a resurgence following the release of a limited-edition 3 CD retrospective box set on the record label Table of the Elements, &quot;An Angel Moves Too Fast to See: Selected Works 1971-1989&quot;, complete with 130-page booklet. The &quot;An Angel Moves Too Fast to See&quot; part of the title comes from Chatham&#x27;s 1989 composition for one hundred guitars. He has been since touring with his one-hundred guitar orchestra in Europe.

In 2005, he was commissioned by the city of Paris, in his adopted homeland, to write a composition for 400 electric guitars entitled &quot;A Crimson Grail&quot;, as part of the Nuit Blanche Festival. Approximately 10,000 people were present at the performance, and 100,000 more watched it on live television. A CD of excerpts from this concert was released in January 2007 by Table of the Elements.

Rhys Chatham was touring the original 30 minute version of &quot;Guitar Trio&quot; in the USA and Europe, renamed &quot;G3&quot; because the instrumentation had been increased to between six and ten electric guitars, electric bass and drums. In February 2007 he completed a twelve-city tour called the &quot;Guitar Trio (G3) Is My Life North America Tour&quot;, which was accompanied by the original film by Robert Longo that was projected behind the performance, entitled &quot;Pictures for Music&quot; (1979). The sets consisted of local musicians from each city of the performances, including members of Sonic Youth, Tortoise, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Hüsker Dü, Brokeback, 90 Day Men, Town &amp; Country, Die Kreuzen, Bird Show and others. A three-CD box set of these performances was released by Table of the Elements in March 2008.

Rhys Chatham made his first American presentation of a composition for a one-hundred guitar orchestra in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on May 23, 2008, with an orchestra composed of local students and teachers, as well as many professional guitarists. This performance was the premiere of a new composition entitled &quot;Les 100 Guitares: G100&quot;.

The American premiere of &quot;A Crimson Grail&quot; was on August 8, 2008. Two-hundred electric guitarists performed the piece at the Damrosch Park Bandshell in New York City. The performance was part of a free concert series, Lincoln Center Out of Doors, that was being commissioned by the Lincoln Center. But rain canceled the concert for safety reasons. For the 2009 premiere, precautions were taken so that the concert could go on even if it rained.

Concurrent with his work for guitar orchestras and smaller ensembles, Chatham&#x27;s trumpet style has evolved from its characteristic distorted sound of the 90s to its present more dreamy and laid back approach to playing the instrument, influenced by players such as Don Cherry and Jon Hassell. Examples of this style can be heard on Chatham&#x27;s releases, &quot;The Bern Project&quot;, released by Hinterzimmer Records in 2010, and &quot;Outdoor Spell&quot;, released in 2011 by Northern Spy.
In 2023 Chatham and his No Wave &quot;&quot; was featured at the Paris Centre Pompidou in a Nicolas Ballet curated exhibition entitled &quot;Who You Staring At: Visual culture of the no wave scene in the 1970s and 1980s&quot;. A video documenting the Pompidou March 8 event &quot;XS: The Opera Opus: An Operatic Transvaluation of No Wave Aesthetics by Joseph Nechvatal and Rhys Chatham&quot; was held and published online at the Pompidou website.

<text>John Picus Quinn (born Joannes &quot;Jan&quot; Pajkos, July 1, 1883 – April 17, 1946) was a Slovak-American professional baseball player. He played as a pitcher for eight teams in three major leagues (the American, Federal, and National), most notably as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1929 to 1931, and won the World Series in 1929 and 1930. Quinn made his final major league appearance at the age of 50.

==Biography==
Born in Stefuró, Hungary (modern-day Štefurov, Slovakia), Quinn emigrated to America as an infant with his parents Michael Pajkos and Maria Dzjiacsko, arriving in New York on June 18, 1884. His mother died near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, shortly after the family&#x27;s arrival in the US, and Quinn&#x27;s father moved the family to Buck Mountain, near Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. In 1887 Quinn&#x27;s father remarried, to Anastasia (&quot;Noska&quot;) Tzar.

Quinn spent his early years working as a swimmer and blacksmith, while playing recreational ball for mining teams. He got his start as a professional in an unusual way. While watching a semi-pro game in Connellsville, the 14-year-old Quinn threw a foul ball back from the stands to the catcher, hitting his mitt right in the middle. The visiting manager, from the nearby town of Dunbar, was impressed by the throw, and he offered Quinn a contract.

Quinn went on to spend 23 seasons in the major leagues with eight different teams. He won 247 games and lost 218 games, also collecting 57 saves. Quinn debuted on April 15, 1909, and he played until he was 50 years old; his final game was on July 7, 1933. Quinn&#x27;s professional longevity enabled him to achieve several age-related milestones. He was the oldest Major League player to win a game until Jamie Moyer broke the record on April 17, 2012. Quinn is also the oldest to lead his league in a major category (saves, in 1932—although saves were unknown in that era, and were only retroactively awarded in 1969). He is furthermore the oldest pitcher to start games in the World Series (with the Philadelphia Athletics, in 1929) and on Opening Day (with the Brooklyn Dodgers, in 1931). He was the oldest player to hit a home run in the majors, at age 46, until 47-year-old Julio Franco did so in 2006. He remains the oldest Major League pitcher to hit a home run. He was the oldest person to ever play for the Cincinnati Reds, and at the time of his retirement, the eight teams for which he had played also constituted a record, which has since been broken. He was also the last major leaguer who had played in the 1900s decade to formally retire (not counting Charley O&#x27;Leary, who in 1934 made a comeback stint). Quinn is one of only 31 players in baseball history to date who have appeared in a Major League game in four decades. Finally, he remains the oldest player to play regularly, having pitched 87 innings in 1932 at age 48 and 49, and 15 innings in 1933 at age 49 and 50. (Franco and Phil Niekro were also regular players at age 48, but were one and five months younger respectively during their seasons at that age.)

During his career, Quinn played alongside 31 different members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and collected two World Series rings in three tries. He was also one of the last pitchers in baseball permitted to throw the spitball, grandfathered in along with sixteen others reliant on the pitch when it was banned in 1920. He frequently used his spitball after he was grandfathered in, in addition to his fastball, curve, and changeup.

Quinn was a good hitting pitcher, posting a .184 batting average (248-for-1349) with 90 runs, 38 doubles, eight home runs, 115 runs batted in and drawing 89 bases on balls. He recorded a .969 fielding percentage including playing several games in the outfield.

In 2006, Jack Quinn was inducted posthumously into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.

Quinn died in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, at the age of 62.

<doc id="963667" wikidata="Q6143987" url="?curid=963667" title="James T. Walsh">
<text>James Thomas Walsh (born June 19, 1947) is an American Republican politician from Syracuse, New York. Currently a government affairs counselor for K &amp; L Gates in Washington, DC, Walsh retired from the United States House of Representatives in 2009 after serving for twenty years. Walsh represented a portion of Central New York, that is now known as the state&#x27;s 24th Congressional District.

While in Congress, Walsh was a member of the United States House Committee on Appropriations for 16 years, also chairing several of its subcommittees. As chair of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, alone, Walsh had spending oversight of more than $100 billion during the 109th Congress. In his capacities as chair and member of committees, subcommittees, and caucuses in Congress, Walsh secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds for veterans affairs, healthcare, technology, the environment, higher educational institutions, and many other areas.

Walsh was further active in the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which the Walsh Visa was created and named in his honor. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus, Walsh secured passage of laws aimed at guaranteeing universal hearing screenings for newborns and infants in the United States. In 2009, an act that he proposed and which was enacted that achieved this effort was renamed for him in his honor, becoming known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Walsh&#x27;s change of perspective regarding both of then-President George W. Bush&#x27;s troop surge of 2007 and ideology regarding the Iraq War, caused Walsh&#x27;s views to gain headlines in the news media, as well as for additionally desiring a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.

For one decade during the 1970s and 1980s, Walsh was active on the Syracuse City Council, serving as its leader for five years. In 1999, he issued a challenge with several goals that is known as The Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative (SNI) for revitalization of the city. The many phases of SNI have been successful in improving neighborhoods and housing in numerous areas of the city.

Generally known as a moderate, pro-labor Republican, Walsh currently lives in Washington, DC with his wife, Dede. Walsh&#x27;s father, William F. Walsh, served as Mayor of Syracuse during the 1960s, as well as a Republican Member of the United States House of Representatives in the 1970s, and his son, Ben Walsh, began serving as Mayor of Syracuse in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Walsh was born in Syracuse, New York, and graduated from St. Bonaventure University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history. He served in the Peace Corps in Nepal from 1970 to 1972 as an agricultural extension agent.

==Early career==

Walsh&#x27;s early employment included that as a Social Services income examiner, and telephone company executive with both AT&amp;T and NYNEX Telecommunications. He served as Director of the Telecommunication Institute at the SUNY Utica-Rome, and taught telecommunication policy as an adjunct professor.

===Syracuse City Council===

At the same time, from 1978 to 1988, Walsh served on the City Council in Syracuse, New York both as a member and President. for five consecutive years in each position. During his 10 years on the Syracuse City Council, Walsh dedicated himself to improving and restoring the city.

== United States House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===
Walsh ran as a Republican, and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988 in what was then the 27th District, handily defeating state Public Service Commissioner Rosemary S. Pooler.

Walsh was re-elected nine times, usually by fairly comfortable margins. The district, which was renumbered as the 25th District after the 1990 census, became increasingly Democratic in the 1990s due to the national Republican Party becoming more conservative. In 1996, he faced a reasonably well-financed challenge from Cortland attorney Marty Mack, and was held to only 53 percent of the vote. He faced his closest-ever race in 2006 against former congressional aide Dan Maffei, winning by only a 51% to 49% margin. He lost Onondaga County, the most populous county in the district and home to Syracuse, but was carried to victory by a strong showing in the more rural areas of the district.

With Maffei priming for a rematch against Walsh in 2008, Walsh announced that January that he would not run for an 11th term. Maffei won the seat in November.

===Political views===
Walsh is generally thought of as a conservative Republican in his views and perspectives on political issues.

In the 109th Congress, Walsh voted along Republican party lines for 84% of his votes. In the 110th Congress, Walsh&#x27;s votes placed him as a centrist between Democrats and Republicans.

Throughout his twenty years in Congress, Walsh introduced 53 bills, co-sponsored nearly 1,700 bills, and enacted 10 bills.

===Tenure and political positions===

====The War in Iraq====

On September 10, 2007, Walsh stated that he favors a gradual withdrawal of American forces from Iraq. This announcement came months after Walsh opposed President George W. Bush&#x27;s troop surge of 2007. Walsh claims that it was a result of personally going to Iraq, and finding that the Iraqi government and military have not done enough on their end.

Walsh supported a bipartisan bill that would set a withdrawal date for American troops to leave Iraq.

====Veterans affairs====

=====MilQual budget appropriations=====

As Chair of the Appropriation&#x27;s Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies during the 109th Congress, Walsh chaired Chair of MilQual, the third largest of the 10 appropriations budgets at approximately $115 billion.

The base was constructed in 1941 during World War II shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor. Originally known as the Syracuse Army Air Base (a.k.a. Mattydale Bomber Base), the base was renamed after Congressman Clarence E. Hancock and now serves as the home of the New York Air National Guard 174 Attack Wing (formerly 174 Fighter Wing), known as Hancock Field ANG Base. Syracuse Hancock International Airport, serving more than 2 million air travelers each year, is located across the street from the Hancock Field.

=====2008 National Military Appreciation Month event=====

Walsh attended an event on Capitol Hill in May 2008 to recognize National Military Appreciation Month. Several United Service Organizations (USO) groups, including members of the USO Congressional Caucus, USO World Board of Governors, USO World Strategic Partners, Congress members, and senior military officials came together to fill 3,000 Operation USO Care Packages for American troops overseas, as well as to recognize the nearly 70-year history of the USO. The USO is a non-profit organization that provides welfare, morale, and recreational services to American military personnel and their families.

Brief summaries of Walsh&#x27;s congressional blog are currently housed in the Friedsam Memorial Library Archives of his alma mater, St. Bonaventure University.

=== Committee assignments and duties ===
Despite the growing Democratic trend in his district, Walsh was able to hold onto his seat due to his long tenure on the House Appropriations Committee. He was chairman of the Subcommittees on the Departments of Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies from 2001 to 2007, thus making him one of the so-called &quot;College of Cardinals,&quot; or &quot;Cardinals of Spending,&quot; of the House due to his influence on national spending policies. It is considered very difficult to unseat an Appropriations Committee member, especially if the member is a &quot;Cardinal.&quot;

=== Honors and awards ===

In 2002, Walsh received a 2002 Ellis Island Medal of Honor for his efforts in working to promote the Irish Peace Process. The award was presented to Walsh by the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, headquartered in New York City.

In June 2003, The Center of Excellence in Environmental Systems, an industry group, presented Congressman Walsh with the Syracuse University Willis H. Carrier Award. This award serves to honor Walsh for his years of service and commitment to protecting the environment and for helping to foster an economic hub for environmental technology through his financial support of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Systems (CoE-ES) and the New York Indoor Environmental Quality Center (NYIEQ).

Walsh has also received many additional awards, including the Exemplary Legislator Award from the Washington, DC National Alliance on Mental Illness – Veterans Council in 2006; Legislator of the Year from Washington, DC&#x27;s Congressional Fire Services Institute in 2004; and Distinguished Service Award from The American Ireland Fund in Washington, DC in 2001.

Further, he was honored with the Capital Award from the National Council of La Raza in Washington, DC in 2001; Affordable Housing Champion from the National Council of State Housing Agencies in Washington, DC in 2000; and the Flax Trust Award from Flax Trust in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1997.

Walsh also received the John Philip Sousa Distinguished Service Award in recognition for his efforts at preserving the historic Congressional Cemetery.

In 2013, Walsh, along with his wife, were honored by Le Moyne College at the school&#x27;s annual Founder&#x27;s Day Gala, where they received the Simon Le Moyne Award for outstanding leadership to the benefit of society. Given every year since 1968, the Simon Le Moyne Award represents the ideals and educational standards exemplified by the man whose name the College and the award signify. The Reverend Simon Le Moyne, a French Jesuit, was the first white man to visit the Syracuse area when the Onondaga Indians inhabited it. Father Le Moyne established the first mission among the Onondagas in 1654. During the same year, Father Le Moyne learned of the salt wells whose economic importance to the development of the City of Syracuse is an intrinsic part of its history. Ideally, the recipient of the Simon Le Moyne Award should be a person(s) cut of the same cloth as Father Le Moyne, an ambassador of peace and a person of faith.

===Reflections of others===

Rudy Giuliani has worked with Walsh, and made a statement in 2007 regarding his work with him.

== Retirement and post-congressional work ==

<text>Wheathampstead is a large village and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England, north of St Albans. The population of the ward at the 2021 census was 6,622. Included within the parish is the small hamlet of Amwell.

==History==
Belgic invaders settled in this area around 50 BC. They moved up the rivers Thames and Lea from what is now Belgium. Evidence for them was found in Devil&#x27;s Dyke, at the eastern side of Wheathampstead. The Devil&#x27;s Dyke earthworks are part of the remains of an ancient settlement of the Catuvellauni and thought to have been the tribe&#x27;s original capital. The capital was moved to Verlamion (which after the Roman conquest the Romans would rename Verulamium, which in turn would become modern St Albans) in about 20 BC.
Although silver Republican coins dating back to 100 BC are common finds around the verulam settlement. 
The Devil&#x27;s Dyke is reputedly where Julius Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus in 54 BC, although this claim is disputed. Some historians suggest that the dyke was part of the same defensive rampart as nearby Beech Bottom Dyke, which, if correct, would make the area one of the largest and most important British Iron Age settlements.

Later, the village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name . It appears that a church existed at Wheathampstead before the Norman Conquest, as Wheathampstead was given by Edward the Confessor to Westminster Abbey, but it is very difficult to determine whether any portion of the present St Helen&#x27;s Church is of Saxon work. The original structure was demolished in the reign of Henry III, the oldest portion of the present church, in the chancel, is assigned to the year 1280.

Some historians have claimed (Trokelowe, (Rolls Ser.), 78.) that in 1312 the barons who leagued against Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston, gathered their troops at Wheathampstead, and whilst there refused to receive emissaries from the Pope, although there seems to be no other documentary evidence of this.

Until 1859, Wheathampstead and Harpenden were part of a single rectory. Before then, several of the rectors of Wheathampstead-cum-Harpenden after 1238 went on to have unusually successful ecclesiastical careers. Richard Sampson, who held the position in the 16th century, was in 1523 appointed Lord President of Wales, and in 1543 consecrated Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Richard Pate, another rector, was in 1554 consecrated Bishop of Worcester. Lambert Osbaldeston was also master of Westminster School, and became more famous later for a controversy with Archbishop Laud; having used libellous language he was, in 1639, deprived of his living and fined £5,000. Henry Killigrew, in 1661, was made Master of the Savoy. John Lambe, whose father mainly devoted his life to the alleviation of the sufferings of prisoners, was also a rector, and was made Chaplain in Ordinary to William III and Mary II. John Wheeldon (1773–1800) was the author of several works, and Queen Victoria&#x27;s private tutor was also a former rector.
The village is also close to Nomansland common, and slightly further afield, St Albans.

==Amwell==
About to the southwest of Wheathamstead and lying within its civil and ecclesiastical parish, the hamlet of Amwell consists of a cluster of cottages and a public house at a crossroads. This small settlement has ancient origins and was first mentioned in 1272 as &quot;Hamewell&quot; in the records of Westminster Abbey. The name is derived from the Old English language &quot;hamm&quot;, an enclosure, and &quot;weille&quot;, a spring. The hamlet has five Grade II listed buildings; four are cottages dating from the 18th century together with the Elephant and Castle pub, whose chimneys may date from the 16th century. A further three houses are locally listed. Amwell became a conservation area in October 1983.

==Transport==
There was once a railway station serving the village but it closed in 1965 - a full amateur film of this line on the last day of operation can be seen on YouTube under the title &quot;Welwyn Garden City, Harpenden East, Luton Hoo, Bute, Dunstable&quot;. Public transport is now provided by an hourly bus between Borehamwood and Harpenden, operated by Aylesbury-based bus company Red Rose Travel. A half-hourly bus operated by Uno also runs through Wheathampstead between Luton and Hatfield.

<text>Scotch Corner is a junction of the A1(M) and A66 trunk roads near Richmond in North Yorkshire, England. It has been described as &quot;the modern gateway to Cumbria, the North East and Scotland&quot;, and is a primary destination signed from as far away as the M6 motorway, away. The junction&#x27;s name is derived from the fact that it is the point of divergence for traffic coming from London, the East Midlands and Yorkshire wishing to continue either to Edinburgh and eastern Scotland (along the A1(M)) or to Glasgow and western Scotland (by taking the A66).

==Geography==

The A1(M) leads north towards North East England and Scotland, and south towards London. The A66 leads north-west towards Penrith and the M6 motorway. There are also three other exits from the junction: the A6055 road north and south, with the southbound side leading to the A6108 towards the Yorkshire Dales and Richmond. The third exit is towards Middleton Tyas and Croft-on-Tees and is a minor road which also provides access to the services.

==Etymology and history==

The name originated from being the junction where the north–south Roman road known as &quot;Dere Street&quot;, which crossed the River Tees at Piercebridge, met the Roman road which went west through Bowes and Brough. It is where travellers to eastern Scotland (now via A1(M) and/or A68) are separated from travellers to western Scotland (now via A66 and M6/ A74(M)/M74).

The Romans were responsible for building the first roads to meet at this point and the site of the original junction is just a few hundred yards away from the modern day intersection. In AD 71 the Romans took control of the area when they defeated the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe at the &quot;Battle of Scotch Corner&quot; (1st century). There was a major Roman settlement at Scotch Corner, with its own mint.

It is a landmark for planning and describing routes. For example, it is around from Leeds, providing a useful distance for cycling events. It was used by cyclists for navigation. It was in a fox hunting district, providing a means of identifying the location when reporting events.

The £8 million Scotch Corner diversion opened in July 1971, which created a grade separated junction on the A1. Later, a £380 million upgrade of the A1 between Leeming Bar and Barton Interchange meant that the road was upgraded to three-lane motorway standard in March 2018. This created the opportunity for further archaeological investigation.

==Facilities==

&quot;The Three Tuns&quot; coaching inn stood at Scotch Corner from the 1820s. The inn subsequently became a roadhouse in the early days of motorised travel. It was demolished in 1939 when the road was widened. The Scotch Corner Hotel was established there in 1939, built on the site of a mid-16th century inn and now operated by Holiday Inn. Almost as soon as it was opened, part of the hotel was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force for convalescing airmen. In 2011 it underwent a £3 million refurbishment.

A Moto Hospitality service station, built in 1980, has an attached Travelodge motel.
