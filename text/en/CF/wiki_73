<text>A campus university is a British term for a university situated on one site, with student accommodation, teaching and research facilities, and leisure activities all together. It is derived from the Latin term campus, meaning &quot;a flat expanse of land, plain, field&quot;.

The founding of these new institutions initiated a wave of far reaching expansion in higher education within the UK and helped open access to Higher Education to students who found access to the more traditional universities difficult or closed. The traditional universities tended to attract students from the exclusive private education sector in the UK and from privileged backgrounds whereas campus universities attracted students from all classes, backgrounds and schools (especially the state funded grammar and then later comprehensive schools).

These institutions also promoted &quot;new&quot; courses of study and so helped initiate not just a great expansion in numbers of students but also in the range of subjects studied.

As such, many students in the campus universities, particularly in the post-war period of 1950 to 1970, were the first member of their family ever to go to university, and were studying new and &quot;exciting&quot; topics, which lent a radical edge to the experience of higher education.

Campus universities are contrasted to collegiate universities, based on a number of colleges (such as the universities of Oxford, Durham, London or Cambridge) or a university consisting of a number of sites, or even individual buildings, spread throughout a town (such as the University of Edinburgh or the University of Sheffield). Confusingly, multi-site universities often call each separate site &quot;a campus&quot; and many original campus universities now have expanded to more than one site (or campus), for example the University of Nottingham.

The classic campus university is often found on the edge of a city. Examples include:
*Aston University in Birmingham is a classic campus university, but located in the city centre of the city.
*University of Bath which is just outside the city of Bath
*University of Birmingham which is located in Edgbaston, 3 miles south-west of Birmingham
*Brunel University London which is in Uxbridge, on the edge of West London
*University of East Anglia which is 3 miles from the city of Norwich
*University of Essex near Colchester
*University of Exeter which has four campuses located in Devon and Cornwall
*Keele University near Newcastle-under-Lyme
*University of Kent which is just on the edge of the city of Canterbury
*Lancaster University near the city of Lancaster
*University of Nottingham which is located on the outer-suburbs of Nottingham
*University of Reading which has three campuses around Reading
*Robert Gordon University on the outskirts of Aberdeen
*University of Roehampton which is located in south-west London
*Queen Mary University of London which is located in Mile End, London
*Royal Holloway, University of London on the outskirts of London
*University of Stirling on the outskirts of Stirling
*University of Sussex which is 4 miles from the city of Brighton
*Swansea University which has two campuses, both 2 to 3 miles from Swansea
*University of Warwick near Coventry
*University of York on the outskirts of York

<text>The Pillars of Creation is the seventh book in Terry Goodkind&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth.&quot; It is the first book in the series not to feature Richard Rahl as the protagonist, although he does appear.

== Plot introduction ==

This book revolves around several new characters in the &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series. Jennsen, for most of her life, has been running from the assassins sent by Lord Rahl to kill her. Any ungifted child of the Lord Rahl must die. A stranger convinces her that running will do her no good for wherever she goes, Lord Rahl&#x27;s soldiers will find her; it is time for her to stop fleeing and fight back. If she wants to live, she must kill Lord Rahl.

== Plot summary ==
Jennsen Rahl, Richard Rahl&#x27;s half sister, has spent the first twenty years of her life running from her father, Darken Rahl. Born without any aspect of the gift of magic, Jennsen has been marked for death since birth. When her mother is apparently murdered by D&#x27;Haran assassins, she sets out with her new friend, Sebastian, to start her life over. Sebastian eventually reveals that he is a spy for the Imperial Order. He speaks convincingly of the Order&#x27;s goals concerning the fair treatment of all humanity and the elimination of magic. Above all else, he esteems Emperor Jagang. In equal measure, he despises Richard Rahl, who he claims has brought on war with an invasion of the Old World after bringing down the Barriers separating the sections of the known world.

Meanwhile, another sibling of Richard&#x27;s, Oba Rahl, suffers under an abusive mother on the family farm. Oba imagines himself as energetic and the possessor of a healthy curiosity. His inquisitive nature manifests itself especially through pleasure in watching things die under his hand. Oba does not know that he, along with Jennsen, is pristinely ungifted and immune to magic. His mother sends him to a nearby sorceress to buy medicine, and, during the purchase, he begins to menace the magic user. Her attempts to defend herself with magic fail and Oba kills her brutally. During the fight, Oba surrenders to a voice in his mind that promises invincibility in return for obedience. After returning home, Oba kills his mother and resolves to see the world. He can travel comfortably with the funds he looted from the sorceress.

Jennsen wants to find another sorceress, the sister of the one Oba killed, and who had previously helped Jennsen and her mother. Along with Sebastian, she travels to the People&#x27;s Palace, capital of the D&#x27;Haran empire. There she learns that the sorceress she seeks lives in a deadly enchanted swamp. After Sebastian is detained by D&#x27;Haran guards, a friendly stranger named Tom helps a desperate Jennsen to the swamp. She safely reaches the sorceress&#x27; home, her natural immunity to magic protecting her through the swamp, but only learns that nothing can be done to save her from Lord Rahl. She leaves, disappointed. However, upon returning to the People&#x27;s Palace, she cleverly rescues Sebastian. He convinces her that she should visit Emperor Jagang, leader of the Imperial Order.

Oba is also aware of the second sorceress and the fact that she knows something concerning his fate or nature. He hires a guide to the swamp, which he safely negotiates as well. The sorceress reveals that Oba is now a thrall to the Keeper of the Underworld and kills herself before Oba can do the deed. This, along with the fact that his guide has stolen all his money, enrages Oba. He is mollified somewhat by the treasure he finds in the sorceresses&#x27; cottage, but his rage returns when, after returning to the People&#x27;s Palace, he spots his guide. After killing the guide, he is briefly jailed but escapes, using the voice in his mind to make the D&#x27;Haran guards do his bidding, and resolves to locate Richard Rahl.

Jennsen and Sebastian reach Emperor Jagang at the van of the army of the Imperial Order. Though initially shocked by the crude Order soldiers, she is advised not to be so picky and that the D&#x27;Harans are even worse. The day after her arrival, the Emperor Jagang assaults the Confessor&#x27;s Palace but is bloodily repulsed. Emperor Jagang is severely injured in the action. Even worse for the Order, their enemy unleashes an ancient magic on the main army, wreaking immense destruction. Jennsen reacts by making a pact with a dark force, the Keeper, to kill Richard in return for her surrender and obedience.

Oba captures Kahlan and is ordered by the Keeper to take her, along with the Sword of Truth, to the Pillars of Creation. Using his link to the sword, Richard pursues Oba to the Pillars, where he encounters Jennsen, who has also been drawn to the same spot by the Keeper in order to kill Richard. The Keeper&#x27;s supreme plan, however, was for Richard to kill Jennsen at the Pillars of Creation and thereby open a gate between the Keeper&#x27;s realm and the world of the living. Richard discerns the plan and refuses to be goaded into cooperating. Jennsen recognizes his integrity and the Keeper&#x27;s plan is foiled. She learns that the men who were sent to kill her mother were actually soldiers of the Imperial Order, and after coming to believe that Richard is truly a loving and caring brother, she joins him and Kahlan in their quest against Jagang.

== Characters ==
== Wizard&#x27;s Seventh Rule ==
The Wizard&#x27;s Seventh Rule, revealed in &quot;The Pillars of Creation&quot;, is:

It is explained in the novel as follows: &quot;The past can teach us, through experience, how to accomplish things in the future, comfort us with cherished memories, and provide the foundation of what has already been accomplished. But only the future holds life. To live in the past is to embrace what is dead. To live life to its fullest, each day must be created anew. As rational, thinking beings we must use our intellect, not a blind devotion to what has come before, to make rational choices.&quot;

== Literary significance and reception ==

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; had this to say in their review of &quot;The Pillars of Creation&quot;: &quot;Amid the interminable sword-and-sorcery in the tradition of Robert E. Howard, the author spouts his familiar political pieties. Lip service may be paid to public good, but passion arises only in scenes of violence. For all its clumsy exposition, unlikely coincidences and feeble attempts at humor, this latest installment, with its striking jacket art showing a beautiful desert landscape, is as certain to please Goodkind&#x27;s legions of fans as previous books in the series.&quot;

<text>Messier 52 or M52, also known as NGC 7654 or the Scorpion Cluster, is an open cluster of stars in the highly northern constellation of Cassiopeia. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1774. It can be seen from Earth under a good night sky with binoculars. The brightness of the cluster is influenced by extinction, which is stronger in the southern half. Its metallicity is somewhat below that of the Sun, and is estimated to be [Fe/H] = −0.05 ± 0.01.

R. J. Trumpler classified the cluster appearance as II2r, indicating a rich cluster with little central concentration and a medium range in the brightness of the stars. This was later revised to I2r, denoting a dense core. The cluster has a core radius of and a tidal radius of . It has an estimated age of 158.5 million years and a mass of .

The magnitude 8.3 supergiant star BD +60°2532 is a probable member of the cluster, so too 18 candidate slowly pulsating B stars, one being a Delta (δ) Scuti variable, and three candidate Gamma Doradus (γ Dor) variables. There may also be three Be stars. The core of the cluster shows a lack of interstellar matter, which may be due to supernovae explosion(s) early in the cluster&#x27;s history.

<doc id="963681" wikidata="Q729175" url="?curid=963681" title="Hemus Air">
<text>Hemus Air (Bulgarian title: Хемус Ер) was an airline based in Sofia, Bulgaria. It operated scheduled domestic and international services from Sofia and Varna, as well as charter, cargo and air ambulance services. Its main base was Sofia Airport, with a hub at Varna Airport. After the acquisition of Bulgaria Air, all of Hemus Air&#x27;s destinations are now under the plate of Bulgaria Air.

== History ==
Hemus Air, named after the ancient name for the Balkan mountains, is owned by Varna-based industrial/financial enterprise TIM. The airline was established and started operations in 1986, when it branched off from Balkan Bulgarian Airlines. It initially operated as a separate department providing ambulance services, flight calibration and aerial photography. In 1996 it became a separate legal entity from Balkan and was named Hemus Air. The company was privatized by Bulgarian corporate investors in 2002 and has faced stiff competition from foreign carriers, as well as the newly established successor of Balkan, Bulgaria Air.

Hemus Air&#x27;s management pledged to unite the major Bulgarian airlines and was selected as the preferred bidder for the sale of Bulgaria Air by the Bulgarian government. In November 2006, Balkan Hemus Group sealed a deal to purchase Bulgaria Air with a 99.99% share of the airline for €6.6 million. The new airline will operate under the Bulgaria Air brand. Hemus promised to invest a further €86m over the next five years. Hemus and Bulgaria Air began to coordinate their schedules and operations in 2007. As of February 2009, all Hemus Air aircraft are operating for the parent company, Bulgaria Air.

== Destinations ==
All Hemus Air destinations are now operated under the commercial brand of Bulgaria Air.

== Fleet ==

The Hemus Air fleet includes the following aircraft (at July 2012):

Most of these aircraft are operating for Bulgaria Air until the two airlines merge; then they will all be transferred to Bulgaria Air&#x27;s fleet.

===Retired fleet===
* Boeing 737-300
* Boeing 737-400
* Tupolev Tu-134
* Tupolev Tu-154
* Yakovlev Yak-40
* Let L-410 Turbolet

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 2 August 1988, Yak-40 LZ-DOK failed to get airborne and crashed after it overran the runway at Sofia Airport, killing 29 of 37 on board. All civil traffic had been halted at Sofia Airport to allow Todor Zhivkov&#x27;s Tu-154 to take off. But the Tu-154 was delayed, so ATC cleared the Yak-40 to take off &quot;as quickly as possible&quot;. In their haste, the crew forgot to set the trim correctly. In a display of indifference, Zhivkov departed as if nothing had happened.
* Hemus Air Flight 7081 was hijacked en route from Beirut International Airport to Varna on 3 September 1996. The hijacker, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, allowed the 150 passengers to leave the aircraft at Varna and he and the eight crew members continued to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen where he gave up. He initially claimed that he only wanted to seek asylum, but he later claimed he was under orders to crash the aircraft into Oslo.

<text>Lake Wylie is a reservoir or man-made lake in the U.S. states of South Carolina and North Carolina. The lake has a surface area of and features of shoreline.

==History==
The man-made lake was first formed when the Catawba Power Company built the Catawba Dam and Power Plant near India Hook, South Carolina in 1904. This dam impounded the Catawba River and created Lake Catawba, which was utilized to create hydro-electric power. In 1905, the Catawba Power Company became part of the Southern Power Company.

In 1924, the Southern Power Company raised the level of the dam and built the new Catawba Hydroelectric Station to replace the original. This facility opened in August 1925, increasing the surface area of Lake Catawba from 668 acres (2.70 km2) to 13,400 acres (54.2 km2). The Southern Power Company was merged with Duke Power Company in 1927.

In October 1960, the power station was renamed the Wylie Hydroelectric Station, and the lake was renamed Lake Wylie in honor of W. Gil Wylie, one of the founders of the original Catawba Power Company that had created the lake and become Duke Power.

==Other information==
Lake Wylie&#x27;s location on both the South Carolina and North Carolina borders makes it a common recreational destination for residents of nearby cities including Charlotte, Fort Mill, and Rock Hill. Duke Power manages six public boat access areas on the lake. There are also two towns that are located on Lake Wylie, including Tega Cay and Lake Wylie.

Lake Wylie is one of 11 lakes on the Catawba River and is the oldest lake in the Catawba River basin, with water being moved around each lake on the chain system through Duke Power. The lake has a surface area of approximately 13,443 acres (54.361 km2) with of shoreline, and stretches from the Mountain Island Dam, south of Mountain Island Lake in North Carolina to the Wylie Dam on the south end of the lake. The average depth of the lake is just over .

The Catawba Nuclear Generating Station is located on the south-western part of the lake, and draws its cooling water from the lake. Allen Steam Station located on the northern part of the lake (west of Charlotte) also draws its cooling water from the lake.

The South Fork River and Catawba River confluence is now submerged under Lake Wylie near the North Carolina/South Carolina state line.

<doc id="963688" wikidata="Q1078765" url="?curid=963688" title="Train wreck">
<text>A train accident or 
train wreck is a type of disaster involving one or more trains. Train wrecks often occur as a result of miscommunication, as when a moving train meets another train on the same track, when the wheels of train come off the track or when a boiler explosion occurs. Train accidents have often been widely covered in popular media and in folklore.

A head-on collision between two trains is colloquially called a &quot;cornfield meet&quot; in the United States.

== Causes ==
Train accidents can occur due to a range of factors, including one or more of the following:
* Human error – One of the leading causes of train accidents is human error. This can involve train operators failing to adhere to safety protocols, distraction, fatigue, impaired judgment, or inadequate training.
* Mechanical failures – Equipment malfunctions or failures, such as faulty brakes, defective signaling systems, or problems with locomotives or railcars, can contribute to train accidents.
* Track and infrastructure issues – Poorly maintained tracks, inadequate inspection procedures, or infrastructure deficiencies like weakened bridges or faulty switches can lead to accidents.
* Weather conditions – Severe weather conditions, including heavy rain, snowstorms, or extreme heat, can impact track conditions, visibility, and the overall safety of train operations.
* Sabotage - People can break, place something, intentionally set the switch to a collision course, destroy tracks, and this is called rail sabotage.
*Attack - Anyone such as terrorists or shooters disrupted rail traffic such as bombing or shooting on a train.

<text>Massive Entertainment AB is a Swedish video game developer and a studio of Ubisoft based in Malmö. The company has been fully owned by Ubisoft since 2008. The studio is known for &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division&quot;, &quot;The Division 2&quot;, &quot;Ground Control&quot;, and &quot;World in Conflict&quot;.

==History==
Massive Entertainment was founded in 1997 by Martin Walfisz. In June 2000, Massive released the award-winning PC action-strategy title &quot;Ground Control&quot;, published by Sierra Studios. The same year an expansion was released named &quot;Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy&quot;.

In 2002, the studio was acquired by Vivendi Universal Games through their NDA Productions subsidiary. In October 2007, they released the game &quot;World in Conflict&quot;, described as a further development of the real-time tactics gameplay formula from the &quot;Ground Control&quot; games, but set on Earth during an alternate history late Cold War. The game was released on 18 September 2007 and won critical acclaim, including nominations for one of the best games of 2007. It was followed by an expansion, &quot;World in Conflict: Soviet Assault&quot;. In December 2007, the studio moved into new offices on Drottninggatan in Malmö, employing 130 people at the time.
On 6 August 2008, Activision Blizzard put up Massive Entertainment for sale after the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games and the subsequent internal reorganization. On 10 November 2008, Ubisoft acquired Massive Entertainment. In March 2009, following the acquisition, the former CEO Martin Walfisz left the company.

In December 2010, Ubisoft confirmed that Massive would be working on an &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; project. On 5 May 2011, it was announced that Massive Entertainment was collaborating on development of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations,&quot; developing the Desmond&#x27;s journey sequences in the game, which was released in November 2011. Massive also collaborated on the development of &quot;Far Cry 3&quot;, which was released in December 2012.

At E3 2013 Massive announced their next game, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division&quot;. The game was released on 8 March 2016 and sold more copies in its first 24 hours than any game in Ubisoft&#x27;s history, the biggest first week for a new game franchise, generating $330 million in its first five days.

In March 2017, Massive announced that their next major title would be based on &quot;James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar&quot;. The game was revealed at E3 2021 to be titled &quot;&quot; and released on 7 December 2023.

In April 2020, Massive and its more than 650 staff moved from the offices on Drottninggatan to Kvarteret Eden, a former textile factory in Malmö&#x27;s Möllevången district.

In January 2021, the newly reformed Lucasfilm Games announced that Massive started work on a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; open world title. This would be the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; game outside of Electronic Arts since they acquired a May 2013 contract to produce all &quot;Star Wars&quot; related titles. This would later be revealed as &quot;Star Wars Outlaws,&quot; and it released in August of 2024.

<text>Scripps Ranch is a community of San Diego, California, in the northeastern part of the city. It is located east of Interstate 15, north of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, and west of Poway. Its ZIP Code is 92131.

Scripps Ranch is an inland bedroom community within the city of San Diego. Miramar Reservoir is located within Scripps Ranch and offers recreational boating and fishing. A feature of Scripps Ranch is its landscaping, which includes mature eucalyptus trees that are most apparent along Pomerado Road.

==History==
E.W. Scripps came to California in 1890 on a steamship to San Diego. He didn’t expect much but as he traveled north, he became more excited. Arriving at a barren, dry hill 16 miles from town, he decided to build a home and named it Miramar “after the Archduke Maximilian&#x27;s castle in Trieste, Italy). He and his mentor-half-sister, Ellen Browning Scripps, bought 400 acres of what is today Scripps Ranch for $5,000; 30 acres were E.W.&#x27;s, for his home and grounds whereas the rest would belong to Ellen. Eventually he acquired 2,100 acres and built a home. The grounds were covered with citrus, pine, eucalyptus, and other beautiful trees (some still stand at the Scripps Ranch Swim and Racquet Club). Ellen lived at Miramar until 1897 and E.W. until 1917. 

In October 2003, a section of south Scripps Ranch was devastated by the Cedar Fire, destroying over 300 homes.

Two elected planning groups (the Scripps Ranch Planning Group and the Miramar Ranch North Planning Committee), advise the city on local planning and land-use issues.

==Demographics==
The 2021 population estimate for Scripps Ranch is 36,307 people living in the neighborhood, an increase of 10.7% from 2010. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 50.6% White, 28.34% Asian and Pacific Islander, 12.3% Hispanic, 1.9% African American, 0.3% from other races, and .07% American Indian. As of 2021, median household income was $154,601; 38% of the 13,301 households made $200,000 or more, while 71% made $100,000 or more and 5.5% made $29,999 or less. 

==Education==
The community is served by the San Diego City Schools.

<text>The Great Hospital is a medieval hospital that has been serving the people of Norwich in Norfolk, UK, since the 13th century. It is situated on a site in a bend of the River Wensum to the north-east of Norwich Cathedral. Founded in 1249 by Bishop Walter de Suffield, the hospital was originally known as Giles&#x27;s Hospital. What makes the hospital notable today is its history of continuous care, the range of existing medieval buildings on the hospital grounds (most of which are still in use), and the extensive archives that record the hospital&#x27;s long history.

==History==
The original beneficiaries of the new hospital in 1249 were aged priests, poor scholars, and sick and hungry paupers. Clerics remained unmarried in this period, so they had no family to support them in old age. The poor scholars, boys selected on merit from local song schools, were to receive a daily meal during term times. This was to continue until the boy had achieved a good grasp of Latin. With this help, bright but poor boys were given the chance to train as choristers or even to enter the priesthood.

Thirty beds were earmarked for the sick poor, and thirteen paupers were to be fed at the hospital gates each day. Four chaplains, a deacon and sub-deacon, as well as a master of St. Giles&#x27;s, were appointed. The hospital was modelled upon the Augustinian rule under which excessive liturgical ritual was discouraged to permit more time for charitable works. Nevertheless, the master and chaplains were bound to sing three masses a day, including one for Bishop Suffield&#x27;s soul, as well as a weekly mass in honour of Saint Giles.

==Modern times==
Since the mid-19th century, living accommodation has been constantly improved to meet residents&#x27; needs. In 1849, five cottages were built; a sick ward followed in 1889, a further 12 cottages in 1906, and another 17 dwellings in 1937. However, it was not only the hospital&#x27;s rising population that generated the need for new buildings; newcomers had higher expectations of levels of comfort, privacy, and space. As a result, the 17 cottages built in 1937 (now called Suffield Court) were later changed to single-person dwellings.

In 1972, the old sick ward was replaced by Elaine Herbert House, where an improved form of nursing care was provided. The lodge was finally demolished in 1975. Prior Court consists of eighteen single and six double flats which are designed to accommodate people who need regular support. It was opened in June 1980. In 1986, St Helen&#x27;s House was converted into eight residential flats. In 1999 a new group of cottages were built behind Suffield Court.

Plans were made to demolish the 12 cottages built in 1906, and replace them with a new two-storey block containing 18 flats. The plans were passed and the demolition and new building work commenced during 2011. These plans include six additional flats to be added to Prior Court, the redesign of the main carpark and a new workshop to be built on the site of the current garages.

The new two-storey block of 18 flats now called Holme Terrace is almost fully occupied and the refurbished Prior Court should start taking in residents within the next few weeks. 

The Great Hospital is part of Norwich 12.

==Buildings==

The Hospital has 9 listed buildings:(all information from The Historic England website)
St. Helen&#x27;s House is a Grade II* Listed building currently in use at the nursing home, but is not part of the Great Hospital as it was originally a residence separate from the Hospital. The house has a painting said to be the work of Angelica Kauffman.

== Masters of the Great Hospital ==
The Head of the Great Hospital is called &#x27;Master&#x27;. Hamon de Calthorpe was the first Master in 1256, and sixty-four Masters have followed him until the present day. Substantial changes that modernised the Great Hospital and ensured that it was a model community for the elderly going into the twenty-first century were initiated by Jack Davies Shaw, Master from 1965 until 1980. The first female Master was Dorothy North from 2000 until 2007, and the current Master is Gina Dormer.

<text>Messier 53 (also known as M53 or NGC 5024) is a globular cluster in the Coma Berenices constellation. It was discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1775. M53 is one of the more outlying globular clusters, being about light-years away from the Galactic Center, and almost the same distance (about ) from the Solar System. The cluster has a core radius (&quot;rc&quot;) of 2.18 pc, a half-light radius (&quot;rh&quot;) of 5.84 pc, and a tidal radius (&quot;rtr&quot;) of 239.9 pc.

This is considered a metal-poor cluster and at one time was thought to be the most metal-poor cluster in the Milky Way. Abundance measurements of cluster members on the red giant branch show that most are first-generation stars. That is, they did not form from gas recycled from previous generations of stars. This differs from the majority of globular clusters that are more dominated by second generation stars. The second generation stars in NGC 5024 tend to be more concentrated in the core region. Overall, the stellar composition of cluster members is similar to members of the Milky Way halo.

The cluster displays various tidal-like features including clumps and ripples around the cluster, and tails along the cluster&#x27;s orbit in an east–west direction. A tidal bridge-like structure appears to connect M53 with the close, very diffuse neighbor NGC 5053, as well as an envelope surrounding both clusters. These may indicate a dynamic tidal interaction has occurred between the two clusters; a possibly unique occurrence within the Milky Way since there are no known binary clusters within the galaxy. In addition, M53 is a candidate member of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream.

Among the variable star population in the cluster, there are 55 known to be RR Lyrae variables. Of these, a majority of 34 display behavior typical of the Blazhko effect, including 23 of type RRc – the largest known population of the latter in any globular cluster. There are also at least three variables of type SX Phe and a semi-regular red giant.

<text>Dame Frances Amelia Yates (28 November 1899 – 29 September 1981) was an English historian of the Renaissance, who wrote books on the history of esotericism.

After attaining an MA in French at University College London, she began to publish her research in scholarly journals and academic books, focusing on 16th-century theatre and the life of the linguist and lexicographer John Florio. In 1941, she was employed by the Warburg Institute in London, and began to work on what she termed &quot;Warburgian history&quot;, emphasising a pan-European and inter-disciplinary approach to historiography.

Her most acclaimed publication was &quot;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition&quot; (1964), in which she emphasised the role of Hermeticism in Bruno&#x27;s works and the role that magic and mysticism played in Renaissance thinking. &quot;The Art of Memory&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Rosicrucian Enlightenment&quot; (1972) are also major works. Yates wrote extensively on the occult or Neoplatonic philosophies of the Renaissance, which she is credited with making more accessible.

==Biography==

===Youth: 1899–1913===
Frances Amelia Yates was born on 28 November 1899 in the southern English coastal town of Southsea. She was the fourth child of middle-class parents, James Alfred and Hannah Malpas Yates, and had two sisters, Ruby and Hannah, and a brother, Jimmy. James was the son of a Royal Navy gunner, and occupied a senior position, overseeing the construction of dreadnoughts. He was a keen reader, ensuring that his children had access to plenty of books.
James was a devout Anglican Christian, influenced by the Oxford Movement and sympathetic to the Catholic Church. Frances was christened in February 1900 at St. Anne&#x27;s Church in the dockyard, although from an early age had doubts about Christianity and the literal accuracy of the Bible.

In 1902, James was transferred to Chatham Dockyards, and then in December 1903 he relocated to Glasgow to become superintendent of shipbuilding on the River Clyde. There, the family began attending the Scottish Episcopal Church of St. Mary. James retired in 1911, although continued to offer his advice and expertise to the dockyards. The family moved regularly over the coming years, from a farmhouse in Ingleton, Yorkshire, to Llandrindod Wells, to Ripon, to Harrogate, and then to Oxton in Cheshire. They also took annual holidays to France each summer.

Throughout this period, Yates&#x27;s education was haphazard. In her early years, she was home schooled, being taught to read by her sisters before her mother took over her education as they moved away from home. When in Glasgow she briefly attended the private Laurel Bank School, but wouldn&#x27;t attend school for two years after leaving the city. Despite a lack of formal education, she read avidly, impressed by the plays of William Shakespeare, and the poetry of the Romantics and Pre-Raphaelites, in particular that of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Keats. She also began to write; in March 1913, Yates published a short story in the &quot;Glasgow Weekly Herald&quot;. Aged 16 she began writing a diary, in which she stated that &quot;my brother wrote poems, my sister writes novels, my other sister paints pictures and I, I must &amp; &quot;will&quot; do something. I am not much good at painting, I am no good at all at music, so there is only writing left. So I will write.&quot;

===Early career: 1914–38===
In 1914, the First World War broke out; her brother joined the British Army, and was killed in battle in 1915. As a result, she asserted that the &quot;war broke our family... As a teenager I lived among the ruins.&quot;
Deciding to pursue a university education, she unsuccessfully sat the University of Oxford entrance exam, hoping to study History. The family subsequently moved to Claygate, Surrey, settling into a newly-built house in which Yates lived until her death. Her sisters had moved away, leaving Frances to care for her ageing parents, although she also regularly took the train to central London, where she spent much time reading and researching in the library of the British Museum.
In the early 1920s she began an undergraduate degree in French at the University College, London. Enrolled as an external student, she devoted herself to her studies, and did not socialise with other students. She was awarded her BA with first-class honours in May 1924. She published her first scholarly article in 1925, on &quot;English Actors in Paris during the Lifetime of Shakespeare&quot;, which appeared in the inaugural issue of &quot;The Review of English Studies&quot;. She then embarked on an MA in French at the University of London, this time as an internal student. Her thesis was titled &quot;Contribution to the Study of the French Social Drama in the Sixteenth Century&quot;, and in it she argued that the plays of this period could be seen as propaganda aimed at the illiterate population. Although authored for a degree in French, it was heavily historical, and showed Yates&#x27;s interest in challenging prior assumptions and interpretations of the past. Supervised by Louis M. Brandin and F. Y. Eccles, she was awarded her MA on the basis of it in 1926. From 1929 to 1934, Yates taught French at the North London Collegiate School, but disliked it as it left little time for her to devote to her research.

While rummaging through the London Public Record Office, she learned of John Florio in a 1585 testimonial. Intrigued by him, she devoted her third scholarly paper to the subject of Florio: &quot;John Florio at the French Embassy&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Modern Language Review&quot; in 1929. She proceeded to author a biography of Florio, &quot;John Florio: The Life of an Italian in Shakespeare&#x27;s England&quot;, which Cambridge University Press published in 1934; they agreed to the publication on the condition that it be shortened and that Yates contributed £100 to its publication. The book gained positive reviews and earned Yates the British Academy&#x27;s Mary Crawshaw Prize. Having previously relied on self-taught Italian, in summer 1935 she spent several weeks at a course in the language held for scholars at Girton College, University of Cambridge; here she developed lifelong friendships with Nesca Robb and Linetta de Castelvecchio, both fellow scholars of the Renaissance. Yates&#x27;s second book was &quot;A Study of Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, an examination of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. It was published by Cambridge University Press in 1936.

Through her research into Florio, Yates had become intrigued by one of his associates, Giordano Bruno. She translated Bruno&#x27;s &quot;La Cena de la ceneri&quot; (&quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;), and added an introduction in which she argued against the prevailing view that Bruno had simply been a proponent of Copernicus&#x27; Heliocentric theories; instead she argued that he was calling for a return to Medieval Catholicism. She offered the book to Cambridge University Press, who declined to publish it, and later commented that it was &quot;the worst of my efforts ... it was lamentably ignorant of Renaissance thought and Renaissance magic.&quot; In reassessing Bruno&#x27;s thought, Yates had been influenced by a number of other scholars who had begun to recognise the role of magic and mysticism in Renaissance thought: French historian of science Pierre Duhem, American historian Lynn Thorndike, and Renaissance studies scholar Francis Johnson. Yates&#x27;s biographer Marjorie Jones suggested that this interpretation was partly influenced by her own religious views, which – influenced by the Romanticists and Pre-Raphaelites – adored Catholic ritual and were critical of the Protestant Reformation.

===Joining the Warburg Institute: 1939–60===
One of Yates&#x27;s friends, the historian and fellow Bruno scholar Dorothea Singer, introduced her to Edgar Wind, Deputy Directory of the Warburg Institute, at a weekend house party in Par, Cornwall. At Wind&#x27;s invitation, Yates contributed a paper on &quot;Giordano Bruno&#x27;s Conflict with Oxford&quot; for the second issue of the &quot;Journal of the Warburg Institute&quot; in 1939, which she followed with &quot;The Religious Policy of Giordano Bruno&quot; in the third issue. In these articles, she did not yet associate Bruno with Hermeticism. In 1941, the Warburg&#x27;s Director Fritz Saxl offered Yates a job at the institute, then based in South Kensington; she agreed, taking on the post which revolved largely on editing the &quot;Journal&quot; but which also gave her much time to continue her independent research. By this time, Britain had entered the Second World War against Nazi Germany, and Yates involved herself in the war effort, being trained in first aid by the Red Cross and volunteered as an ARP ambulance attendant. In 1941, her father died during an air raid, although the cause of death is not known. Yates herself continued to battle with depression, and was deeply unhappy.
In 1943, Yates was awarded the British Federation of University Women&#x27;s Marion Reilly Award. She also gave an address to the Federation&#x27;s Committee on International Relations on &quot;How will History be written if the Germans win this war?&quot; At the Warburg, her intellectual circle included Anthony Blunt, Margaret Whinney, Franz Boaz, Ernst Gombrich, Gertrud Bing, Charles and Dorothea Singer, D. P. Walker, Fritz Saxl, Eugénie Droz, and Roy Strong. At this time, she also developed lifelong friendships with Jan van Dorsten and Rosemond Tuve, both scholars.

Upon Britain&#x27;s victory in the war, Yates was among a number of Warburg scholars who emphasised the need for pan-European historiography, so as to reject the nationalisms that had led to the World Wars; this approach, she believed, must be both international and interdisciplinary. She described this new approach as &quot;Warburgian history&quot;, defining this as the &quot;history of culture as a whole – the history of thought, science, art, including the history of imagery and symbolism.&quot; Connected to this, she believed that school education should focus on pan-European, rather than simply British history.

The Warburg Institute published Yates&#x27;s third book in 1947 as &quot;The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century&quot;. She described this as &quot;an ambitious effort to apply the Warburgian modes of work, to use art, music philosophy, religion&quot; to elucidate the subject. The following year, she began to contemplate writing a book on Bruno, and spent September 1951 in Italy, visiting places that had been associated with his life. By 1948, both Yates sisters had moved back to the family home in Claygate; however, in March 1951 Hannah died of leukemia, and Yates&#x27;s mother died in October 1952. Despite the problems in her personal life, she continued her scholarship, typically publishing two or three scholarly papers a year. She also lectured on the subjects of her research at various different universities across Britain; during the 1950s she lectured on the subject of &quot;espérance impériale&quot;, which would later be collected and published as &quot;Astraea: The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century&quot; (1975).

In 1954, Gertrud Bing became Director of the Warburg, overseeing the move from South Kensington to a specially constructed building in Woburn Square, Bloomsbury. Bing was a close friend of Yates, and they often went on holidays together. Yates&#x27;s fourth book, published in 1959, was &quot;The Valois Tapestries&quot;, in which she discussed the eponymous tapestries in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy. She offered a novel interpretation of the tapestries, approaching them as if they were &quot;a detective story&quot; and arguing that they were meant as portraits of the French royal family.

===International acclaim: 1961–81===
Yates&#x27;s scholarly productivity increased in the 1960s and 1970s, when she also became a regular book reviewer for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.
In 1961, Yates authored &quot;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition&quot;, which has come to be widely regarded as her masterpiece. In her diary, she wrote that she now &quot;saw Hermeticism as the clue to Bruno and the whole view of Renaissance magic in relation to him.&quot; She had been encouraged to adopt this view by her friend, D.P. Walker. The book was published in 1964 by Cambridge University Press. The work brought her international scholarly fame, and in 1965 she went on a lecture tour of the United States. Her next publication was a part-sequel to &quot;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition&quot;, being published as &quot;The Art of Memory&quot; in 1966. In 1967, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). In 1969 she published &quot;Theatre of the World&quot;. Her next book, published by Routledge in 1972, was &quot;The Rosicrucian Enlightenment&quot;, in which she looked at the influence of the Rosicrucian manifestos in 16th century Europe.

In 1971, Yates was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of East Anglia, which was presented to her by Angus Wilson, and in the New Year Honours 1972 Yates was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire &quot;for services to Art History&quot;. In October 1973, she was awarded a £5000 Wolfson Award for her wider oeuvre, and in January 1974, Yates delivered four Northcliffe lectures at University College London (UCL). They would subsequently be published by Routledge in 1975 as &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Last Plays: A New Approach&quot;. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975. That same year also saw the publication of &quot;Astraea: The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century&quot;, which collected together lectures that she had presented in the 1950s. In February 1976, Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts offered Yates the Kennedy Professorship, which she declined.

Yates was promoted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1977 to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) &quot;for services to Renaissance studies&quot;. In 1978, the University of Pisa awarded her the Premio Galileo Galilei for her contribution to the study of Italian history. In March 1979, the British Academy awarded her a £2000 grant so that she could continue to travel from her home to London in order to conduct research.

In 1974, an academic conference was held at UCLA&#x27;s Clark Library in Los Angeles, California, that debated and discussed what was termed the &quot;Yates thesis&quot;. The last decade of her life saw her critics become both more numerous and more outspoken; however, she gained a champion in the form of historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, who positively reviewed her works and became a personal friend. In 1979, Yates published &quot;The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age&quot;, in which she discussed the place of the Christian Cabala during the Renaissance and its influence on Christian Neoplatonism. It did not prove as successful as her books published in the 1960s.

It was during the early 1970s that she began writing an autobiography, inspired by E. M. Forster&#x27;s biography of Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson; it was left unfinished on her death, although portions were published posthumously.
In March 1979, Yates moved her sister Ruby into a nursing home, before embarking on a lecture tour of the U.S. Ruby died in May 1980, leaving Yates as the last surviving member of her immediate family. In 1980 Yates was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In summer 1981, Yates traveled on a lecture tour of Hungary, coming to believe that Anglophone scholarship had neglected Central Europe. Her final lecture was delivered at Manchester Cathedral, and was on the subject of John Dee, whom Yates was taking an increasing research interest in. Shortly after, she fell over at home, and was hospitalised with a cracked femur. She recovered and returned home, where she died in her sleep. Her body was cremated in an Anglican memorial service.

==Scholarly writings==
With the publication of &quot;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition&quot; Yates highlighted the hermeticism within Renaissance culture, and spoke of the interest in mysticism, magic and Gnosticism of Late Antiquity that survived the Middle Ages. Yates suggested that the itinerant Catholic priest Giordano Bruno was executed in 1600 for espousing the Hermetic tradition rather than his affirmation of cosmic eccentricity. Her works drew attention to the role played by magic in early modern science and philosophy, before scholars such as Keith Thomas brought this topic into the historiographical mainstream. Thomas references Yates, alongside Piyo M. Rattansi, for the basic point that hermetic thinking fed into the foundations of modern science, before being dispelled later.

Yates&#x27;s biographer Marjorie Jones asserted that &quot;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition&quot; &quot;galvanized Renaissance historiography&quot; by illustrating how mysticism and magic had played a role in Renaissance culture and the scientific revolution. She further asserted that the book &quot;brought [Yates] to the forefront of Renaissance studies.&quot;

==Reputation==
Historian of religion Henrik Bogdan asserted that Yates&#x27;s work was &quot;instrumental in changing the attitude of historians of science and philosophy toward esotericism.&quot;

Although some of her conclusions would later be challenged by other scholars, Yates remains one of the major scholars of hermeticism in Renaissance Europe; and her book &quot;The Art of Memory&quot; (1966) has been named one of the most significant non-fiction books of the 20th century. Paolo Rossi identified two key points in it: the past importance and later loss of mnemotechnics as a human power, where he argues that she overstated the occult or &quot;Jungian&quot; aspect; and the subsequent marginalization of the area, which he considers valid and of wider applicability. &quot;Frances Yates and the Hermetic Tradition&quot; by Marjorie G. Jones, the first biography of Yates, was published in 2008 by Ibis Press.

===Scholarly critiques===
It is now said that Yates founded a paradigm, or gave out a grand narrative. In those terms, a so-called Yates paradigm (sometimes Yates Thesis), her work is contested freely. This is a view that Wouter Hanegraaff has put forth, starting with Yates as the scholar first to treat Renaissance hermeticism, integrated with Rosicrucianism, as a coherent aspect of European culture. He has stated it as an attractive paradox, the autonomous esotericism helping give birth to the scientific mentality that will be dismissive of its parent. But, it is now said, there was no unitary esoteric tradition and that view is only tenable on a selective reading of the evidence. The arguments surrounding this questioning of Yates include Lodovico Lazzarelli and the rival views of Antoine Faivre, who has proposed a clearer definition of esotericism.

Hanegraaff argued that the reception of Yates&#x27;s work was coloured by the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. An extra assumption, that the magus had a point of view that could be recovered, was fashionably added. Further he argues that essentialist rather than nominalist use of the very term &quot;esotericism&quot; has vitiated succeeding work. The &quot;Yates paradigm&quot;, in his view, dominated in the 1970s but fell by the wayside in the 1980s for scholars. Hints on the &quot;Yates thesis&quot; were left as sketches in works of Yates herself (Francis Bacon in relation to hermeticism, and the Hartlib circle, in particular). These related to paths, and how actual influence on science was effected.

Brian Vickers identifies Rattansi, A. G. Debus and Peter J. French as on the side of the Yates thesis, with M. B. Hesse, Edward Rosen, Paolo Rossi, and Charles Trinkaus on the other side. He notes that the debate (up to 1984) was not conducted by close reading of texts and evidence; he himself is entirely unconvinced by the thesis.

Yates&#x27;s scholarship was often criticised for using what she termed her &quot;powerful historical imagination&quot;; she put forward scenarios that could not be proved using documentary evidence, something that many other historians saw as a flaw in her methodology.

But she &quot;dealt with traditions whose remoteness she could not eliminate, even while she made them more understandable.&quot;

===Influence on popular culture===
John Crowley drew extensively on Yates for the occult motifs in &quot;Little, Big&quot; (1981) and the &quot;Ægypt&quot; series (1987–2007) in which she briefly appears as a character.

Philip Pullman was influenced by Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition for the design of the alethiometer in the His Dark Materials series (1995–2000).

==Personal life==
Yates&#x27;s biographer Marjorie G. Jones described the historian as a &quot;deeply emotional, even passionate&quot; woman, who was &quot;depressive, moody, [and] frequently unhappy&quot;, as well as being fiercely determined and hard working. Jones noted that Yates remained a product of Victorian thought and value systems throughout her life. She was highly critical of nationalism, seeing it as the cause for the European wars of the early 20th century, and sought to find a solution to Europe&#x27;s conflicts in history, particularly the 16th century. However, when it came to party politics, she was largely apolitical.

In 1942, she commented that &quot;I am an Anglican who takes the historical view that the Nazi [i.e. Protestant] revolution of 1559, and all the miserable complications which ensued, deprived me of part of my natural and native inheritance as an English Catholic.&quot;

Yates&#x27;s journals only allude to one potential romantic attachment, to a man named Leonard, although there is no evidence that they had a relationship. There is no evidence that she was ever sexually involved with another person, although her journals are filled with references to a personal struggle against temptation, which may refer to sexual thoughts. For years, she was a chain smoker.

In 2017, she featured in a conference, &quot;London&#x27;s Women Historians&quot;, held at the Institute of Historical Research.

<text>Dorothy Louise Slaughter (née McIntosh, August 14, 1929 – March 16, 2018) was an American politician elected to 16 terms as a United States representative from New York, serving from 1987 until her death in 2018. 

Slaughter was born in Lynch, Kentucky. She studied microbiology and public health at the University of Kentucky, earning both a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree. After moving to New York and becoming involved in politics as a member of the Democratic Party, she was elected to a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1982 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986. Slaughter represented Rochester and most of surrounding Monroe County; she represented the 30th district from 1987 to 1993, the 28th district from 1993 to 2013, and the 25th district from 2013 until her death.

Slaughter served as chair of the House Rules Committee from 2007 until 2011; she was also the ranking minority member of the Committee from 2005 to 2007, and from 2011 until her death. Slaughter was the lead House sponsor of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which became law in 2008. Along with Senator Joe Biden she co-sponsored the Violence Against Women Act. At the time of her death, Slaughter was the oldest sitting member of Congress and the last sitting member born in the 1920s.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Slaughter was born Dorothy Louise McIntosh on August 14, 1929 in Lynch, Kentucky, a coal mining town built by a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. She was the daughter of Daisy Grace (née Byers; 1903–1987) and Oscar Lewis McIntosh (1901–1987), a blacksmith for a coal mine. She had two brothers, Philip and David, as well as two sisters, Marjorie and Virginia. Her sister Virginia died of pneumonia while she was a child; Slaughter later cited this as her reason for earning degrees in microbiology and public health. Slaughter graduated from Somerset High School in Somerset, Kentucky.

Slaughter graduated from high school and enrolled at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, where she studied microbiology. Inspired by the loss of her sister to pneumonia, she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in bacteriology. She went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree in public health, also from the University of Kentucky. Completed in 1954, her master&#x27;s thesis focused on the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. After graduate school, Slaughter went to work for Procter &amp; Gamble in New York doing market research.

==Early political career==
Slaughter was first elected to the Monroe County Legislature in 1975. Upon taking office, she was one of only two female members of the county legislature. In 1975, while serving in the county legislature, she accepted an offer from then-New York Secretary of State Mario Cuomo to serve as his regional coordinator in the Rochester area. When Cuomo was elected lieutenant governor in 1979, Slaughter stayed on as his Rochester regional coordinator.

In 1982, local Democratic supporters approached Slaughter with a desire to see her run to represent the 130th District in the New York State Assembly against the Republican incumbent, Thomas A. Hanna. Slaughter challenged Hanna, and she won with 52 percent of the vote. In 1984, she ran for reelection against the Republican and Conservative parties&#x27; candidate Donald S. Milton. She was re-elected with 55 percent of the vote. Slaughter sat in the 185th and 186th New York State Legislatures.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

After four years in the Assembly, Slaughter decided to run for the Democratic nomination in New York&#x27;s 30th congressional district. At the time, the district included downtown and eastern Rochester, most of eastern Monroe County, all of Genesee County and northern Livingston and Ontario counties. Moderate Republican Barber Conable had represented the district for 20 years before giving way in 1985 to a considerably more conservative Republican, Fred J. Eckert. Slaughter defeated Eckert by one point in the 1986 midterm election.

After becoming the first Democrat to represent the district since 1963, Slaughter ran against a young member of the Monroe Country Legislature, 33-year old John D. Bouchard. As her district continued its transition from a Republican stronghold, her supporters came out in droves in the 1988 Congressional Election, with her gaining nearly 40,000 more votes than she did in 1986, winning with 56.9% of the vote. Her opponent John D. Bouchard, received one of the highest vote totals tallied against Slaughter for the duration of her time in Washington.

Redistricting after the 1990 census renumbered Slaughter&#x27;s district as the 28th District and turned it into a much more compact district comprising a narrow ribbon in Monroe County. In the process, she picked up the remainder of Rochester. At the same time, the neighboring 29th District of 30-year incumbent Republican Frank Horton, a close friend of Slaughter&#x27;s, was dismantled, and his home was drawn into the new 28th. The district had already been moving away from its moderate Republican roots, but the new territory made the district solidly Democratic. Horton opted to retire rather than run against Slaughter.

After the 2000 census, much of her district was merged with the 29th District of fellow Democratic Representative John LaFalce, which included Niagara Falls and the northern third of Buffalo. Original plans called for LaFalce&#x27;s district to be merged with that of Republican Jack Quinn, who represented the other side of Buffalo. The new district retained Slaughter&#x27;s district number, but was geographically more LaFalce&#x27;s district. Only a thin tendril in Orleans County connected Rochester to Buffalo. However, LaFalce did not seek a 15th term, effectively handing the seat to Slaughter.
Following the 2010 census, Slaughter&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 25th District. It was significantly more compact than its predecessor, as it took in most of Monroe County and lost its territory near Buffalo. However, it was also slightly less Democratic than her former territory. While President Barack Obama carried the old 28th with 69 percent of the vote, he only received 59 percent of the vote in the new 25th. She faced a vigorous challenge from Republican Monroe County Executive Maggie Brooks, but Slaughter won a 14th term with 57.4% of the vote, on November 6, 2012.

In the 2014 election, Slaughter narrowly defeated her Republican opponent, Gates town supervisor Mark Assini, by 869 votes. After an extended period of vote counting, Assini conceded defeat on November 12, 2014, more than a week after the election was held. It was the first close race that Slaughter had faced since her initial bid for the seat. In a 2016 rematch against Assini, Slaughter prevailed by a 55.7%-44.3% margin.

===Tenure===
In January 1987, Slaughter entered Congress. During her entire tenure, she was a &quot;fierce advocate&quot; for medical research, women&#x27;s health, neurology and genetic rights. In 1993, as a member of the United States House Committee on the Budget Slaughter secured the first $500 million earmarked by Congress for breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health. Slaughter was also a co-sponsor of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, and fought to ensure the legislation included language guaranteeing that women and minorities were included in all federal health clinical trials from that point forward. Previously, all NIH-funded research was done on white males, even in trials related to predominantly female diseases such as breast cancer. Slaughter fought to include language establishing an Office of Research on Women&#x27;s Health at NIH in the legislation. Ten years after the creation of ORWH, the National Institutes of Health awarded Slaughter its &quot;Visionary for Women&#x27;s Health Research&quot; award.

In 1994, along with Senator Joe Biden, Slaughter co-authored the Violence Against Women Act which is designed to reduce incidences of domestic violence in the United States and provide resources to victims.
Along with Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), she introduced the Women&#x27;s Progress Commemoration Act which established the Women&#x27;s Progress Commemorative Commission in 1998.

After the 2006 mid-term takeover of the House by the Democratic Party, Slaughter was chosen to serve as Chairwoman of the United States House Committee on Rules at the start of the 110th Congress. She was the first woman in history to chair the Rules Committee, and she served in that capacity until 2011.

In 2007, Slaughter introduced the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), which would limit the use of antibiotics in livestock feed, to counter the threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria. She has reintroduced her legislation in every subsequent session of Congress. The legislation would phase out the use of eight major classes of antibiotics in healthy food-producing animals, while allowing their use for treatment of sick animals. She cited her scientific training as the impetus for her dedicated interest on the topic, stating in an interview, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that I was far-seeing then that they were going to use antibiotics in agriculture. But I have worked on preserving antibiotics for decades.&quot;

Slaughter strongly supported the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. She introduced the bill repeatedly over a period of 14 years before it was signed into law on May 21, 2008. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is designed to prohibit discrimination by employers or health insurers based upon an individual&#x27;s genetic information.

In 2009, Slaughter wrote to the United States Department of Defense requesting an investigation into faulty body armor after reading an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, entitled, &quot;Pentagon Study Links Fatalities to Body Armor.&quot; The article authored by Michael Moss reported that up to 80 percent of Marines who were killed in Iraq from wounds to the upper body could have survived if they had extra body armor. Slaughter&#x27;s request resulted in the Department of Defense launching an investigation, recalling 16,000 pieces of body armor and replacing them with safer armor.

Slaughter was chairwoman of the United States House Committee on Rules during the writing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and managed the rule for the legislation on the House Floor. In March 2010, Slaughter proposed that a House rule be passed to expedite the passage of health care reform legislation. The rule allows the House to deem the Senate version of the health care reform bill &quot;already passed&quot; by the House without the House holding a recorded vote on the bill. Critics, who called the strategy the &quot;Slaughter Solution&quot;, charged this proposed strategy was an affront to democratic principles and challenged its constitutionality. Ultimately this legislative strategy was never used to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through the House. Supporters observed that the courts had affirmed the rule&#x27;s constitutionality, and that Republicans had used the rule repeatedly to pass major legislation such as the Patriot Act and the Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.

In 2011, Slaughter secured $62.5 million in federal funding for the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at University of Rochester. Slaughter&#x27;s efforts to secure funds for her district was recognized by the Rochester Institute of Technology when it named its Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies facilities in her honor. During the same year, with the potential of a government shutdown looming, Slaughter referenced H.R. 358, introduced by Rep. Joseph Pitts during the 112th Congress, when she said at a pro-choice rally, &quot;This is probably one of the worst times that we&#x27;ve seen because the numbers of people who are elected to Congress. I went through this as co-chair of the Arts Caucus. In &#x27;94, people were elected simply to come here to kill the National Endowment for the Arts. Now they&#x27;re here to kill women&quot;.

After the shooting of Gabby Giffords, Slaughter suggested the Federal Communications Commission was &quot;not working anymore&quot; and called for better policing of incendiary language.

During the 112th Congress, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, which Slaughter first authored and introduced into Congress in 2006 – was passed into law. The law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees, and requires many financial transactions by members of Congress to be reported within 45 days.

Slaughter was one of the most liberal and progressive members of the New York congressional delegation from upstate New York, and in the 110th Congress, was the most progressive member of the entire House of Representatives according to the National Journal.

Slaughter was one of several Democratic members of Congress who posted at Daily Kos, a Democratic-oriented blog. She was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She was the oldest member of Congress at the time of her death.

==Personal life and death==
While traveling for work, she met Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Slaughter in San Antonio, Texas, and married him in 1957. After marrying, the couple moved to Fairport, New York, a suburb of Rochester, where Bob had been offered a job. The couple had three daughters. Bob Slaughter died in May 2014, aged 82. She was an Episcopalian.

To the day she died, Slaughter still spoke with a marked Kentucky accent, which took many by surprise when they learned she represented a Western New York district.

On March 14, 2018, Slaughter was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after suffering a concussion in a fall at her home in Washington, D.C. Two days later, on March 16, Slaughter died at the age of 88.

Slaughter&#x27;s funeral was held at the Eastman Theater in Downtown Rochester. The funeral was attended by more than 2,000 people and featured speakers such as House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Congressman John Lewis, former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and members of Slaughter&#x27;s family. The event was also broadcast live on local television channels Spectrum News, WHAM-TV and WHEC-TV.

A day after Slaughter&#x27;s death, Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, along with former New York Lieutenant Governor and former Rochester mayor Bob Duffy, asked Amtrak to rename its Rochester station in Slaughter&#x27;s honor. Slaughter had played a significant part in securing the funding for replacing Amtrak&#x27;s 1970s-vintage station with a new multimodal station that opened in 2017. Four days later, Amtrak announced that it would rename the station. The station was renamed the Louise M. Slaughter Rochester Station on March 25, 2019.

<text>Lake Wissota is a reservoir in Chippewa County, Wisconsin, United States, just east of the city of Chippewa Falls. It covers an area of and has a maximum depth of .

Lake Wissota is surrounded on the south by the town of Lafayette, on the north and east by the town of Anson, and on the west by the town of Eagle Point.

The lake is divided into two parts by a peninsula upon which is the center of Lake Wissota Village. The smaller southern portion of the lake, the flooded portion of the valley formed by Paint Creek, is often called &quot;Little Lake Wissota&quot;. The larger portion of the lake, lying to the north of Lake Wissota Village, is usually just called &quot;Lake Wissota&quot;, although it is sometimes also called &quot;Big Lake Wissota&quot;. The lake is fed by several other rivers and streams besides the Chippewa River, which enters the lake from the northwest and exits to the southwest, and Paint Creek which enters Little Lake Wissota from the east, respectively. These include Stillson Creek, which enters Little Lake Wissota from the southwest, the Yellow River which enters from the east at Moon Bay, and O&#x27;Neil Creek, which enters in the northwest, near the entrance of the Chippewa River.

The lake is a popular recreation destination in northwestern Wisconsin, in the summer for boating, canoeing, fishing, water skiing, and swimming, and in the winter for ice fishing. On the northeastern shore lies Lake Wissota State Park, popular with campers, hikers, swimmers, and anglers.

In popular culture, Lake Wissota is mentioned in the film &quot;Titanic&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s main protagonists, Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), states that he and his father would go ice fishing on Lake Wissota. However, Lake Wissota was not created until 5 years after the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; sank.

==Wissota Hydroelectric Dam==

The lake was formed by the construction of the Wissota Hydroelectric Dam on the Chippewa River, completed in 1917. The dam was built by the Wisconsin-Minnesota Light and Power Company. An engineer on the project, Louis G. Arnold, named the lake by combining the beginning of &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and the ending of &quot;Minnesota&quot;. The dam is now owned and operated by Xcel Energy, and is capable of producing 36 megawatts.

<text>An overcoat is a type of long coat intended to be worn as the outermost garment, which usually extends below the knee. Overcoats are most often used in winter when warmth is more important. 

They are sometimes confused with or referred to as topcoats, which are shorter and end at or above the knees. Topcoats and overcoats together are known as outercoats. Unlike overcoats, topcoats are usually made from lighter weight cloth such as gabardine or covert, while overcoats are made from heavier cloth or fur.

==History==
In many countries, coats and gowns reaching below the knee have been worn for centuries, often for formal uses, establishing either social status or as part of a professional or military uniform. In the 17th century, the overcoat became widely stylized and available to the different classes.

In the Western world, the general profile of overcoats has remained largely unchanged for a long time. During the Regency, the fashion was to have very form-fitting clothes, with sidebodies, waist seams, and a flared skirt. Examples of this included the frock overcoat and paletot.

<doc id="963738" wikidata="Q6478346" url="?curid=963738" title="Lake Waccamaw">
<text>Lake Waccamaw is a fresh water lake located in Columbus County in North Carolina. It is the largest of the natural Carolina Bay lakes. Although bay trees (&quot;Magnolia virginiana L.&quot;, &quot;Gordonia lasianthus Ellis&quot;, and &quot;Persea&quot;) are present within many Carolina Bays, the term &quot;bay&quot; does not refer to the trees but comes instead from an early science publication by Glenn (1895), who used the word &quot;bay&quot; (which he described as &quot;lake-like expanses&quot;) to refer to these features near the town of Darlington, South Carolina. Lake Waccamaw is fed by four creeks: First, Second, Third, and Big creeks. The outlet forms the Waccamaw River which flows south-southwest to empty into the Atlantic Ocean near Georgetown, South Carolina

==Geography==
Lake Waccamaw has a broad, flat bottom of gyttja (mud) and peat, encircled by sandy shallows and submerged sandy terraces that extend up to offshore. The lake is oval in shape, measuring roughly by , covering surface area with an average depth of and a shoreline of about . The marginal 70% of the lake bottom is composed of clear sand, whereas the central 30% is overlaid with a deposit of fibrous and pulpy peat. The lake is fed mainly by Big Creek and the surrounding swamp lands. The organic matter from the decaying vegetation of the swamps makes the water tea-colored. The lake is full of life. Unlike most of the other Carolina Bay lakes, Lake Waccamaw gets the majority of its water from the surrounding swamp, instead of direct rain water. A limestone bluff along the north shore filters the water and reduces the acidity levels, making the lake ideal for a wide range of aquatic life. Lake Waccamaw has several feeders, called First Little, Second Little and Third Little Creeks and then Big Creek as well as water from the Friar swamp. Underground springs feed the creeks.

==Geology==
Lake Waccamaw is one of the larger Carolina Bays. Recent work by the U.S. Geological Survey has interpreted the Carolina Bays formed several thousands of years ago when the climate was colder, drier, and windier. Thermokarst lakes develop by thawing of frozen ground (permafrost) and by subsequent modification by wind and water. Thus, this interpretation suggests that permafrost once extended as far south as the Carolina Bays during the last ice age and (or) previous ice ages.

The lake has been estimated to be between 15,000 and 30,000 years old. It is underlain by strata containing fossils of various ages, including the lower Pliocene Goose Creek Limestone and the lower Pleistocene Waccamaw Formation. In 2008, a whale fossil was found in the lake. Scientists have removed the bones of a whale that they say may date back 1 - 3 million years. The skull of the whale has been restored and is currently on display at Lake Waccamaw State Park through longstanding loan from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.

==Ecology==
Several endemic species are found only in or around the lake, including the Waccamaw darter, silverside and killifish. The lake even contains some species of fish, such as the Waccamaw silverside, that are native only to Lake Waccamaw. The water also contains a diversity of unusual mollusks. Genetic analysis shows that the mussel species reported as endemic are not distinct from populations outside the lake, but many of the freshwater mollusks and fish found in the lake are imperiled, especially with declining water quality. Fifteen species of mussels and clams are reported from the lake. And, of the 11 snail species, the Waccamaw amnicola and siltsnail are also one-of-a-kind species. Alligators are also found at Lake Waccamaw.

The lack of rain in the eastern portion of North Carolina during 2007 affected the water level in Lake Waccamaw. Water levels dropped greater than below normal as of late 2007. The record low is recorded in 1993. The record high was above normal in 1999. In 2008, some additional rain and swamp drainage had increased the water levels.

In October 2012, there was a hydrilla outbreak. Efforts to free the lake of the invasive weed were estimated to take between 5 and 7 years.

==Human history==
Before the arrival of European settlers to the area surrounding Lake Waccamaw, it was inhabited by Native Americans. A place still called Indian Mounds is on the east shore and on the site of one mound, it is said nothing will grow.

Charles II of England originally granted this land to one of the Lord Proprietors who made individual grants to those willing to settle in this part of the new world. These large grants were divided among heirs and new settlers. By the mid-18th century, few of the early settlers or their descendants were left around the lake area. They were replaced by people such as John Powell, who brought cattle from Virginia to settle his grant of land.

There is a quote attributed to John Bartram stating, &quot;This is the pleasantist place that I have ever seen&quot;. There is, however, no evidence of this quote in his writings. The origin of the quote is perhaps explained by The News Reporter which states, &quot;N.C. State University researcher John A. McGeachy seems to have found it in his paper “Travel on the Cape Fear River in the Colonial Period&quot;. A group of at least 14 men traveled the area with Nathaniel Moore in 1733. The publication from that trip was called “A New Voyage to Georgia.” From old Brunswick they traveled up the Cape Fear River to Moore&#x27;s place, then to Lake Waccamaw, described by an unnamed author as “the pleasantest place that ever I saw in my life.”

John Powell&#x27;s son, Absalom, after the American Revolutionary War, started buying large areas of land. A North Carolina Historical Marker was placed near his grave on August 22, 1933 at Lake Waccamaw. John Powell&#x27;s son, Isaac, of Lake Waccamaw was appointed first major for Bladen County militia in 1804 and a Justice of the Peace in 1806. He was the largest landowner of his day in Columbus County, owning over 10,000 acres (40 km²) - most of his land in the area of Lake Waccamaw.

The lake was established as a North Carolina State Lake in 1929, and it is managed by the adjacent Lake Waccamaw State Park.

A natural sand bar, which extends along the northwest shore between a fringing cypress swamp and the main lake, was supplemented with spoil dredged to form a neighboring canal in 1946 and developed with private residences. Big Creek delivers tea-colored water from the large cypress and gum tree swamp at the northeast corner of the lake, and the Waccamaw River emerges from the southern shore. A dam at the outlet, built in 1926, now regulates lake levels, which used to fall by as much as a meter during dry spells, occasionally exposing the sand terraces. The dam was renovated in 2008 to help restore control of the lake water levels.

The Lake Waccamaw Depot museum, housed in a 1904 Atlantic Coast Line Railroad depot, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Exhibits include a 300-year-old Indian canoe and marine fossils recovered from the lake, natural history specimens, Waccamaw Siouan Indian artifacts, early European settler artifacts, railroad including a caboose, information on local industries including turpentine, cypress shingles, logging, and tool manufacturing, along with many old photographs. The hours are Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 10 AM to 3 PM and Sundays from 3 to 5 PM. Admission is free. The museum is handicapped accessible.

==Legends of Lake Waccamaw==
There are many theories regarding the formation of Lake Waccamaw. One legend told is the story where the meteor (falling star) hit the earth on the southeast side of the lake and destroyed all the beautiful flowers that were placed in the garden by the warriors when they came back from a hunt or from protecting the village. The flower garden was taken care of by the women of the village. Many animals lived in the garden as well. Because the people forgot to give thanks to the Creator and became full of themselves, the Creator sent the meteor as punishment. To this day, the Waccamaw Siouan people remember the stories told.

Another legend is recorded in the book Recollections and Records. In the book the lake&#x27;s origin is described in terms of a European-American romantic myth. According to local tradition, the large and beautiful lake was once a mound of flowers. The keeper of this beautiful garden was an American Indian princess who was known to all as the most beautiful princess in all the world. Each spring it became the custom for the chiefs of all tribes to send their sons to the camp of the princess. There they were received from her hands a blessing and a wild rose that would bring them good luck. As the tale goes, a young brave who had seen the princess asked her to become his wife. She replied that she had promised never to marry so she could stay in the garden, teach, and send all of the tribes her blessings. The brave became very angry and swore that he would destroy the mound of flowers. His tribe invaded and overcame the Waccamaw braves and their chiefs. The princess knelt and asked to die in the garden. She requested that the mound of flowers be changed into a beautiful lake that man could not destroy. She asked too, that the lake would never become dry and that the waters should always be pure and crystal.

<text>The Northern Pikes are a Canadian rock band formed in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1984. The original members are Jay Semko, Bryan Potvin, Merl Bryck and Glen Hollingshead, who left the band in 1985 and was replaced by Jay Semko in June 1986. Rob Esch left after the second independent EP Scene In North America (1987?)

The band was active until 1993 and toured and recorded again from 1999 through to the present.

The Northern Pikes were inducted into the Western Canadian Music Hall of Fame on Sunday, September 30, 2012, in Regina, Saskatchewan.

The band released its ninth record of original material, &quot;Forest of Love&quot;, on June 7, 2019.

==History==
The Northern Pikes released two independent EPs before being signed to Virgin Records in 1986, &quot;The Northern Pikes&quot; (1984) and &quot;Scene in North America&quot; (1985). They also recorded a song for &quot;Saskatchewan After Dark&quot;, a 1985 compilation of Saskatchewan-based artists sponsored by the provincial government. Their first album for Virgin, &quot;Big Blue Sky&quot;, included the Semko-penned &quot;Teenland&quot;, the band&#x27;s first significant hit. The follow-up album &quot;Secrets of the Alibi&quot; contained three Canadian hits, &quot;Wait for Me&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot; &amp; &quot;Hopes Go Astray&quot;.

Their 1990 album &quot;Snow in June&quot; became their biggest seller in Canada and the US. That album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;She Ain&#x27;t Pretty&quot;, was the band&#x27;s biggest hit, and was written by Potvin. An innovative music video for that song received heavy play on MuchMusic and was nominated for a Juno Award in 1991. Overall, the band has been nominated for five Juno Awards, but have yet to record a win.

In early 1992, the band released the single &quot;Everyone&#x27;s a Hero&quot; for the Canadian Special Olympics. Later that year, the band released their next album, &quot;Neptune&quot;. The album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Believe&quot;, was written by Potvin. After touring to support the album, they announced their retirement as a group in July 1993.

In 1999, Virgin Records asked the band members for their input on a &quot;greatest hits&quot; package. The band decided to do a short promotional tour following the release of &quot;Hits and Assorted Secrets 1984-1993&quot;, but found themselves enjoying the more relaxed independence of making their own schedule that they continued touring. They have since released three independent albums, including &quot;Truest Inspiration&quot; (2001) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; (2003), as well as the aptly titled &quot;Live&quot; (2000).

In 2005, the band struck up a musical collaboration with Les Stroud. Throughout 2005 and 2006 they performed together live several times. A six-song EP born from this collaboration entitled &quot;Long Walk Home&quot; was released in the spring of 2007, and was credited to &quot;Les Stroud &amp; The Pikes&quot;.

In 2006, Merl Bryck made the decision to curtail his touring schedule, and left the Northern Pikes. Long-time sideman Ross Nykiforuk joined the band on keyboards as the fourth member onstage from 2006 to 2011. Since then, Semko, Potvin and Schmid have continued touring under the Northern Pikes banner as, in their own words, a &quot;power trio&quot;. In 2017, Grapes of Wrath guitarist Kevin Kane joined them for their 30th Anniversary of &quot;Big Blue Sky&quot; Tour, becoming a full-time member of the band in 2018 for the recording of &quot;Forest Of Love&quot;. The 10-track record is the band&#x27;s first in 16 years and also features original members Semko, Schmid and Potvin. BlueFrog Studios hosted the band for two official pre-release concerts on June 6, 2019, which were viewed via Facebook Live and YouTube Live. The band began working on a new album in early 2020, which Jay Semko described as a &quot;tribute to &quot;Snow in June&quot;&#x27;&quot; but postponed finishing it due to travel restrictions and difficulty getting together in studio due to the Covid pandemic. They plan to finish it and have it out by 2022.

In 2019, Semko recorded a new version of the band&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;The Things I Do for Money&quot;, in collaboration with cellists Theodor and Maximilian Aoki, for the soundtrack to Warren P. Sonoda&#x27;s feature film &quot;Things I Do for Money&quot;.

<doc id="963742" wikidata="Q836103" url="?curid=963742" title="Junkers Ju 288">
<text>The Junkers Ju 288, originally known within the Junkers firm as the EF 074, was a German bomber project designed during World War II, which only ever flew in prototype form. The first aircraft flew on 29 November 1940; 22 development aircraft were eventually produced.

The Ju 288 was the winner of the Bomber B contest, although the contest was started by the Junkers firm&#x27;s submission of the EF 074 and their selection was never really in doubt. The &quot;Bomber B&quot; concept of a &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; was originally intended to replace the Junkers Ju 88. The Ju 288 offered a design that was larger, offered cabin pressurization for high altitude missions, had longer range, a much greater bomb payload, was even faster, and had improved defensive firepower. The design was intended to replace all the bombers then in &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service.

Delivering all of these requirements in a single airframe demanded much more powerful engines; all of the Bomber B concepts, at one time or another, relied on the Junkers Jumo 222 engine to deliver this power. Ultimately, the Jumo 222 was a failure in spite of massive effort and several redesigns over a period of several years, with nearly 300 development prototypes produced. No suitable replacement was ever forthcoming, dooming the Ju 288 program, and leaving the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; with older bomber designs during the second half of World War II.

==Design and development==

Prior to the opening of World War II, the Luftwaffe bomber force included three major types, the Dornier Do 17 and Ju 88, both classed as &quot;schnellbomber&quot;, and the slower but somewhat larger Heinkel He 111. Although the Ju 88 outperformed the other designs in service, it however possessed adverse characteristics, including its very small internal bomb bay that forced it to carry some of its load externally, degrading performance.

Junkers had been outlining a variety of improved models of the Ju 88 since 1937, powered by the planned Jumo 222 multibank engine, or Jumo 223 inline multibank diesel of greatly increased power meant to achieve a output level, a serious challenge for Germany&#x27;s aviation engine industry of the time. The EF 074 was essentially a scaled-up Ju 88, sharing its general layout and most of its fuselage and wings with extensions in various places. The nose was redesigned with a more streamlined &quot;stepless cockpit&quot;, having no separate windscreen panels for the pilot and co-pilot. This layout allowed cabin pressurization to be more easily implemented. This design approach had been growing in favour, subsequently appearing in various German types, notably the He 111P and -H&#x27;s.

All of the defensive armament was meant to be remotely controlled comprising a remotely operated rear-facing dorsal turret at the rearmost end of the cockpit glazing, and two remotely operated &quot;flank&quot; turrets on the rearwards sides of the fuselage just forward of the empennage, otherwise each resembling the FDSL 131 units of the Me 210. The exclusive use of remotely operated turrets for the Ju 288&#x27;s defensive firepower allowed them to be positioned more efficiently, as well as eliminating &quot;breaks&quot; in the fuselage pressurization.

The fuselage was expanded along its length to allow for a much longer bomb bay – somewhat as had been done with the Dornier Do 217 then in development itself – that would allow for a 3,630 kg (8,000 lb) payload to be carried internally, eliminating the need to carry ordnance on outside hardpoints.

===Bomber B Competition===

No serious work was undertaken on these versions, but after Heinrich Hertel left Heinkel and joined Junkers in 1939, the EF 074 design was submitted to the RLM in May 1939. Accordingly, the RLM sent out the specifications for the Bomber B design competition in July, the Ju 88 retroactively becoming the second aircraft to be designated Bomber A, as the 3 June 1936 specification for the He 177 also had that name. The Bomber B program aimed at replacing all of the medium bombers in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; inventory with a new design based on the EF.74 or something with equal performance. Bomber B was intended to have even better speed than the Ju 88, high-altitude cruising with a pressurized cockpit, heavier defensive armament, range allowing it to cover any point in the British Isles, and a 4,000 kg (8,820 lb) warload, double that of the earlier generation bombers. A number of companies returned proposals, but these were to some extent a formality, the EF.74 had already been selected as the winner, and of the rest of the designs submitted, only the Focke-Wulf Fw 191 and Dornier Do 317 progressed even as far as prototypes, and the Henschel Hs 130 coming under consideration as a late entrant.

Work began on building prototypes soon after, and the first example was completed by mid-1940. Power was supposed to be supplied by two 24-cylinder Jumo 222 six-bank, four cylinders per bank, over-1,500 kW output class powerplants, but problems with the Jumo 222&#x27;s development – as with almost every new concept for over-1,500 kW output, reciprocating aircraft engines then underway in the Third Reich – meant the first prototypes flew with BMW 801 radial engines, instead. The first flight-quality 222s did not arrive until October 1941, and even then it was clear they were nowhere near ready for full-scale production. When it became apparent the 222 was not likely to become a viable powerplant, in May 1942, Junkers proposed replacing them, for their projected Ju 288C version, with the much heavier Daimler Benz DB 606s instead; the same 1.5 tonne, twin-crankcase &quot;welded-together engines&quot; that &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring complained about some three months later, regarding the He 177&#x27;s own endless powerplant troubles.

===Undercarriage difficulties===

The Ju 288&#x27;s intricate main landing gear system&#x27;s design proved to be troublesome, possessing twin vertical members comprising the main &quot;Y-shaped&quot; retraction strut unit, directly behind a single oleo strut, for each pair of twinned wheels mounted through a forward-projecting lever-action arm, to the lower end of the uniquely attached main oleo strut unit. This single-tube oleo strut was pivoted off the lower end of the twin-member, &quot;Y-shaped&quot; retraction strut unit, and was rotated in the vertical plane about this single attachment in a rearwards direction during retraction of the main-gear unit, separate from the twin-member unit to help &quot;shorten&quot; its stowed length within the engine nacelle. 

This distinctive type of design required the oleo strut&#x27;s freely moving top end to rotate physically downwards and aftwards during the rear-swinging retraction of the main &quot;Y-shaped&quot; member, operated by a lever and gear-sector system mounted on the portside of each main gear assembly, operated with a long lever that had its upper end pivoted from a fixed bracket, anchored to the firewall&#x27;s rear surface. The lever/sector gear system swiveled the oleo strut about its attachment point during the retract cycle, through an arc of roughly 180º from its position when the main gear was fully extended. The stowed position of the oleo strut ended up orienting it aftwards within the rear of the engine nacelle, and placing the wheels&#x27; axle location just ahead of and above the oleo strut&#x27;s pivot point when fully retracted. 

Such a complex main gear design, with only the single pivoting retraction point for its oleo struts taking the primary stress of touchdown, was likely only one of the many potential sources of trouble causing the Ju 288&#x27;s main gear units to collapse repeatedly on touchdown.

==Operational history==

Although the 288 never even reached production status, let alone official operational service, the aircraft did see limited combat duty. In 1944, following the cancellation of the 288 program, the surviving A and C series prototypes were hurriedly fitted with defensive armament and equipment and deployed as reconnaissance bombers on the Western Front. Very few missions were flown, owing to the scarcity of aviation fuel, spare parts and the unresolved problems with the aircraft&#x27;s powerplant and undercarriage. It is believed that the 288s were attached to the same unit operating the small number of Ju 388 reconnaissance planes that saw service.

==Variants==
* Ju 288A – first seven prototypes with BMW engines
* Ju 288B – seven prototypes with slightly enlarged airframes and better defensive armament
* Ju 288C – final eight prototypes (of which only four were completed) with two Daimler-Benz DB 606 or 610 &quot;power system&quot; engines. This version was selected for serial production in 1944, but the program was abandoned before this could take place.
* Ju 288D – mock-up of a Ju-288C with improved tail armament
* Ju 288G – design for an anti-ship version armed with a 355.6 mm (14 in) recoilless cannon

<doc id="963744" wikidata="Q2621911" url="?curid=963744" title="Sigurd Ibsen">
<text>Sigurd Ibsen (23 December 1859 – 14 April 1930) was a Norwegian writer, lawyer and statesman, who served as the prime minister of Norway in Stockholm (1903–1905) and played a central role in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905.

==Early life==
Ibsen was born in Christiania (now called Oslo), but grew up mostly in Germany and Italy. Being the only child of playwright Henrik Ibsen and his wife Suzannah Thoresen, he struggled all his life to meet his family&#x27;s high expectations.

Ibsen developed &#x27;remarkably early&#x27;, being able to read at the age of four and was fluent in Norwegian, German and Italian. Growing up however, Ibsen struggled to find friends who were Norwegian and his age, further complicated by the fact that his family was often deep in penury, and thus he appeared throughout his life to be impersonal to others who did not know him. He excelled in academics however, aiming to please both his parents and himself, and subsequently came top in his class for every subject including mathematics, which appears to have been a weak point of his.

==Adulthood==
After passing his matriculation exams, Ibsen received a doctorate in law at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1882. He founded a magazine, &quot;Ringeren&quot;, in which he published articles about the changing roles of monarchy and republicanism.

Later, he was appointed to the position of Prime Minister of Stockholm and Norway at his father&#x27;s behest so that he would remain a Norwegian citizen.

==Prime Minister in Stockholm==

From 1903 to 1905, Sigurd Ibsen served as Prime Minister of Norway in Stockholm (i.e., the leader of the Norwegian delegation to the King of Sweden and Norway and the second highest cabinet position). During his term, George Francis Hagerup was Prime Minister in Christiania. Sigurd Ibsen played a central role in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, being credited with having introduced the idea. He is also regarded as important in convincing influential Norwegians supporting a republican government, like Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Arne Garborg and Fridtjof Nansen, to turn and instead support a monarchy. To his colleagues, Ibsen was an outspoken Norwegian patriot who was to be avoided, though his ideas succeeded in the end.

== Personal life ==
Some time in the late 1800s, Ibsen travelled to Aulestad to personally thank his father&#x27;s old friend: author Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson for his political support, and he thus met Bjornson&#x27;s family for the first time. Bjornson&#x27;s daughter Bergliot remarks that she and her siblings were very excited to see Ibsen for he had been &#x27;written and talked about so much&#x27;. Though she writes that she personally &#x27;did not altogether like him&#x27; at first since he appeared to be &#x27;too serious&#x27; and was &#x27;mostly talking to Father&#x27;, although she reveals that one day she was on the lower veranda of the house when Ibsen on the upper one. Suddenly he looked down and smiled at her with &#x27;his beautiful eyes&#x27;, and it appears to be this moment at which Bergliot fell in love with him as she describes, though Ibsen himself does not mention the event himself in any surviving letters or works by him.

His father, Henrik Ibsen did not initially approve of their engagement as he felt he should have known first (even going so far as to publicly deny his son&#x27;s engagement and subsequently angering both his son and Bjornson), though he finally accepted it and Sigurd and Bergliot married on 11 October 1892.

The Ibsens had three children. Their son, Tancred Ibsen, became a well-known film director and their daughter, Irene Ibsen Bille, was married to Josias Bille, a member of the Danish ancient noble Bille family. Irene and Josias&#x27;s sons and Sigurd and Bergliot&#x27;s grandsons were Danish manager Anders Steensen Bille and Danish actor Joen Bille. Sigurd and Bergliot also had another daughter: Eleonora, who married Danish author Svend Borberg and had three children.

== Death ==
Towards the end of his life, Sigurd Ibsen was said to be constantly in a low state of mind (a trait which seems to have been passed on to his daughter Eleonora), and lived &#x27;in his own world&#x27;, though he was at times lively and even slightly flirtatious as he had always been. None of his family noticed that he was seriously ill from what was actually cancer as he still had very good movement although, his wife mentions that he had to suddenly speak in a hoarse whisper. After a medical operation that was made on his throat, his final days were mostly spent unconscious, he died on 14 April 1930.

Sigurd Ibsen is buried in the Cemetery of Our Saviour, in Oslo, Norway.

<text>Sovereign&#x27;s Bodyguard is the name given to three ceremonial units in the United Kingdom who are tasked with guarding the Sovereign. These units are:

*His Majesty&#x27;s Body Guard of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Armsformed 1509
*King&#x27;s Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guardformed 1485
*Royal Company of Archers, the King&#x27;s Body Guard for Scotlandformed 1676; entered royal service 1822

Although the Yeomen of the Guard is older, the Gentlemen at Arms are more senior, due to their being classed as &#x27;gentlemen&#x27; rather than &#x27;yeomen&#x27;, and because they are classed as the &#x27;nearest guard&#x27;, i.e. the personal guard to the Sovereign. The Royal Company of Archers performs this role when the Sovereign is in Scotland.

== Other Royal Bodyguards ==
* Yeomen Warders were originally a detachment of the Yeoman of the Guard, appointed by Henry VIII to guard the Royal Palace of the Tower of London in 1509
* High Constables and Guard of Honour of the Palace of Holyroodhouse created in the early sixteenth century to guard the Palace and Abbey of Holyroodhouse, and enforce law and order within the precincts of the Palace and the Holyrood Abbey Sanctuary.

<doc id="963752" wikidata="Q964060" url="?curid=963752" title="Lake Isabella">
<text>Lake Isabella also called Isabella Lake, is a reservoir in Kern County, California, United States created by the earthen Isabella Dam. At , it is one of the larger reservoirs in California. Lake Isabella is located about northeast of Bakersfield, and is the main water supply for that city. It was formed in 1953 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Kern River at the junction of its two forks. The area is in the southern end of the Sierra Nevada range and the lake itself is located in low mountains at an elevation of approximately where summer temperatures reach over but low enough to avoid winter snows on the surrounding ridges. The former towns of Isabella and Kernville were flooded when the reservoir was created.

== Capacity ==
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates and has jurisdiction over the main and auxiliary dams. In 2006, Isabella Dam was found to be too unstable to hold a full amount of water and approximately 37% of a full reservoir had to be let out to restabilize the earth works. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not let the water get above 63% of capacity until an estimated 10–15 years of studies and repairs were made. The Isabella Dam bisects an active fault that could lead to a catastrophic failure if an earthquake occurs along it. This fault was considered inactive when the site was studied in the late 1940s. The project to retrofit the dam was substantially completed in 2022.

On February 3, 2023, the Army Corps of Engineers requested a deviation from the operating pool restriction of of water. If approved, Lake Isabella will be allowed to fill to its full capacity of for the first time in nearly 15 years.

==Recreation==

Kern County Parks maintains law enforcement and rescue responsibilities on the lake. Several recreation areas are located around the lake as a part of the Sequoia National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service oversees the majority of the land that touches the shore including boat ramps, campgrounds, roadways, and leases to private vendors providing services. The nearby towns of Lake Isabella and Kernville receive economic benefit from tourism created by the Lake Isabella Recreation Area and the whitewater rafting attraction of the Upper and Lower Kern River. Lake Isabella can be reached by car from Bakersfield via state Highway 178 and from Delano via Highway 155.

<text>Thomas M. Reynolds (born September 3, 1950) is an American politician from the U.S. state of New York, formerly representing the state&#x27;s 27th and 26th Congressional districts in the United States House of Representatives. Reynolds was chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the official Republican House campaign organization, for the 2006 election cycle. He retired amid scandal at the end of the 110th Congress. He was cleared of any wrongdoing by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. Chris Lee was elected to succeed him.

==Early life==
Reynolds was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the Springville-Griffith Institute. He served in the New York Air National Guard from 1970 to 1976.

He entered politics as a Republican, and was elected to the Concord, New York, town board in 1974, and to the Erie County legislature in 1982. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (147th D.) from 1989 to 1998, sitting in the 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st and 192nd New York State Legislatures. He was Minority Leader from June 1995 to March 1998.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===1998 election===
Reynolds ran for the House in 1998 after Bill Paxon was forced out of his leadership role in the House Republican leadership ranks because of his role in a coup attempt against Newt Gingrich. Paxon endorsed Reynolds, who had managed several of his past campaigns, as his successor. There was controversy because Reynolds did not live in Paxon&#x27;s district; his Springville home was in the neighboring district of fellow Republican Jack Quinn, who was running for his own reelection. Reynolds would not move into the district until eight months after the election when he purchased a home in Clarence, near Amherst, one of the larger towns in the seven-county district.

===Committee assignments===
* Ways and Means Committee
** Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures
** Subcommittee on Trade

===Political positions===
Reynolds had a conservative voting record in Congress. His 83 percent rating from the American Conservative Union tied him with Peter T. King of Long Island as the third-most conservative among the state&#x27;s 29 Representatives as of the 110th Congress. Only Representatives Randy Kuhl (92%) and Vito Fossella (84%) received higher ratings. Reynolds is on record as a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

===Re-elections===
In the 2000 round of redistricting, a special master proposed a plan that would have made his district slightly more Democratic. Although Republicans would have still held a plurality, the plan would have left Reynolds vulnerable to a primary with a moderate Republican. According to one political strategist, Reynolds and his allies in Washington wanted a district that would let him vote &quot;like a Southern conservative&quot;. With the help of Vice President Dick Cheney, Reynolds pressured the state legislature to gerrymander his district so that it closely resembled his former territory.

He was handily reelected from this reconfigured district in 2002. In 2004, his opponent was millionaire industrialist Jack Davis. Reynolds won by 12 points, an unusually close margin given that he had won with 72% of the vote two years earlier. In 2006 Reynolds again defeated Davis by 4% of the vote amid the Mark Foley page scandal.

==Retirement and lobbying career==
On March 20, 2008, Reynolds announced he would not run for a sixth term: &quot;it was time to take up new challenges&quot;. Aside from fallout from the scandal regarding U.S. Representative Mark Foley (R-FL), another factor was thought to be revelations that a former NRCC treasurer had embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the committee treasury while Reynolds chaired it. According to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; political reporter Elizabeth Benjamin, the NRCC was never independently audited during Reynolds&#x27; three-year tenure as its chairman.

Reynolds was the 29th Republican incumbent to announce he would not run again in 2008. Despite the perception that Reynolds had the district redrawn to protect him, it is actually a somewhat marginal district on paper; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+3.

In 2017, Reynolds joined Washington, D.C., lobbying firm Holland and Knight as a senior policy advisor.

==National Republican Congressional Committee==

Reynolds served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2003 to 2006. During the 2004 House elections the Republicans gained three seats to increase their majority to 232. The 2006 House election saw a Republican loss of 30 seats, losing the majority to the Democrats.

==2006 House page scandal==
Rodney Alexander (R-Louisiana), the sponsor of a House page (from his district) who received e-mails from Representative Mark Foley, told reporters that he learned of the e-mails from the page&#x27;s family in November 2005. Alexander said the family did not want the matter pursued. Alexander said he passed information that Foley had appeared overly friendly first to Majority Leader John Boehner, and later to Reynolds, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Carl Forti, a spokesman for the GOP campaign organization, said Reynolds also was told by Alexander that the parents did not want to pursue the matter and that they did not want a large-scale investigation.

Reynolds later issued a statement that he had spoken with House Speaker Dennis Hastert about the matter early in 2006. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Republican insiders said Reynolds spoke out because he was angry that Hastert appeared willing to let him take the blame for the party leadership&#x27;s silence.&quot; Hastert did not &quot;explicitly recall&quot; that conversation but said he did not dispute it.

On October 2, Reynolds held a press conference on the matter, from Buffalo at Daemen College while surrounded by numerous children of his adult supporters. He said he took the Foley matter to his &quot;supervisor&quot; as soon as he found out about it. Reynolds claimed that he had no knowledge of any sexual conversations or e-mails between Foley and the page until after it was disclosed in the media.

Soon after, he made a televised campaign advertisement stating that he had had no knowledge of the depth of Foley&#x27;s transgressions until afterwards. In December 2006, Reynolds was largely exonerated by the Republican-controlled House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which probed the Foley case. The &quot;Rochester Democrat and Chronicle&quot; reported in its December 9 edition that &quot;Rep. Tom Reynolds told the truth when he said he told House Speaker Dennis Hastert about ex-Rep. Mark Foley&#x27;s questionable e-mails to congressional pages, the House ethics committee has concluded&quot;, while the Associated Press reported &quot;the House ethics committee on Friday cleared Rep. Thomas Reynolds and his ex-chief of staff Kirk Fordham of wrongdoing in the congressional page scandal.&quot;

On page 76 of its report, the committee reported they had uncovered that &quot;the communications directors for both the House Democratic Caucus and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also had copies of the e-mails in the fall of 2005&quot;, months prior to Reynolds&#x27; knowledge of the incident. During the 2006 campaign, Republicans charged that Democrats had prior knowledge of Foley&#x27;s inappropriate e-mails with a House page. Democrats, including DCCC Chairman Rahm Emanuel, denied the accusation.

<text>Daniel Manus Pinkwater (born November 15, 1941) is an American author of children&#x27;s books and young adult fiction. His books include &quot;Lizard Music&quot;, &quot;The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death&quot;, &quot;Fat Men from Space&quot;, &quot;Borgel&quot;, and the picture book &quot;The Big Orange Splot&quot;. He has also written an adult novel, &quot;The Afterlife Diet&quot; (1995), and essay collections derived from his talks on National Public Radio.

Many elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth.

==Early life, family and education==
Born Manus Pinkwater in Memphis, Tennessee, to Jewish immigrant parents from Poland. He describes his father, Philip Pinkwater, as a &quot;ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew&quot; and &quot;gangster&quot; who was expelled from Warsaw by the decent Jews. He and his family moved to Chicago, where he was raised.

He attended the Black-Foxe Military Institute in Hollywood, where he befriended Errol Flynn&#x27;s son Sean, and wound up in high school back in Chicago. After graduating, he attended Bard College, in New York State. An art major, he found the experience of studying art in a college unsatisfactory, and served an apprenticeship with sculptor David Nyvall in Chicago. After three years, Nyvall told Pinkwater that he would never make it as a sculptor, and Nyvall had always thought he would be a writer. Pinkwater says he always regretted the unkind things he said to Nyvall on that occasion.

A moment of fame came when he posed as Inspector Fermez LaBouche for the fumetti strip that ran in the final issues of &quot;Help!&quot; (September 1965); he had been spotted at a party by Terry Gilliam. Pinkwater rode in a Volkswagen convertible to a photo shoot with Gilliam, Robert Crumb, and Help&#x27;s creator Harvey Kurtzman—none of the men had any interest in the others. He met a children&#x27;s book editor by chance at a party; he invited her to his studio to promote an African artist&#x27;s cooperative, and she suggested that he illustrate a book. Pinkwater received a $1,500 advance for his first book, &quot;The Terrible Roar&quot; (1970), after replying that he would try to write the book himself.

With his wife Jill, Pinkwater published a dog training book and ran an obedience school while living in Hoboken, New Jersey. At the time, he was training to become an art therapist, but found he was unsuited to the work and dropped his studies. However, he attended a meeting of an unspecified cult with a therapy client. He and his wife Jill later joined the cult, then eventually left it.

Pinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker.

Pinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, &quot;Daniel Pinkwater&quot;, &quot;Daniel M. Pinkwater&quot;, &quot;Daniel Manus Pinkwater&quot;, &quot;D. Manus Pinkwater&quot;). He adopted the name Daniel in the 1970s after consulting his cult&#x27;s guru, who said his true name should begin with a &quot;D&quot;.

===Themes===
Pinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (&quot;Lizard Music&quot;), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (&quot;Borgel&quot;), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar radio antennae (&quot;Fat Men from Space&quot;). They are often, though not always, set in thinly—or not at all—disguised versions of Chicago and Hoboken, New Jersey.

He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head. This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in &quot;Lizard Music&quot; he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man. Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the Chicago Loop that changed features daily and stayed open all night), Bughouse Square, and Ed &amp; Fred&#x27;s Red Hots.

Another common theme is Jewish culture, with character names referencing Yiddish phrases (for example, Shane Ferguson from &quot;Lizard Music&quot; is named after the phrase &quot;shoyn fergessen&quot;) or the characters themselves incongruously speaking in Yiddish-influenced dialogue or participating in Borscht Belt culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the &quot;-stein&quot; element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., &quot;Wentworthstein&quot;).

In 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, &quot;The Afterlife Diet&quot;, in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky Catskills resort populated by &quot;circumferentially challenged&quot; deceased.

===Comics and radio===
Pinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip &quot;Norb&quot;, which was illustrated by Tony Auth. The strip, syndicated by King Features, launched in 70 papers, but received nothing but hate-mail from the readers. Auth and Pinkwater agreed to end the project after 52 weeks. The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by MU Press in 1992.

Pinkwater was a longtime commentator on &quot;All Things Considered&quot; on National Public Radio. He regularly reviewed children&#x27;s books on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot;. For several years, he had his own NPR show: &quot;Chinwag Theater&quot;. Pinkwater was also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show &quot;Car Talk&quot;, where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of automobiles. In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company.

===Challenged book===
Following an appearance by Pinkwater on the Public Radio International program &quot;This American Life&quot;, his book &quot;Devil in the Drain&quot; ended up on challenged book lists at numerous children&#x27;s libraries.

===&quot;The Hare and the Pineapple&quot; used on exams===
In April 2012, a story attributed to Daniel Pinkwater, &quot;The Hare and the Pineapple&quot;, was used on a standardized exam for 8th grade students in New York. The story was based on Pinkwater&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Story of the Rabbit and the Eggplant&quot;, which he had sold to the testing company. The published version changed the racer from an eggplant to a pineapple, and changed the moral of the story. Of the six questions asked of the students, two stood out as the most perplexing: &quot;The animals ate the pineapple most likely because they were ___?&quot; and &quot;Which animal spoke the wisest words?&quot; These questions baffled students. City Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott issued a statement saying improvements on the state exam will be made in the future. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; staff sent the question to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champion Ken Jennings, and he was stumped as well.

<text>John E. Peterson (born December 25, 1938) is an American Republican politician from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. From 1997 to 2009, he represented the state&#x27;s mainly rural and largely Republican 5th Congressional district in the U.S. House.

==Biography==
John Peterson was born in Titusville, Pennsylvania on December 25, 1938. He served in the Army, both active and reserve duty, from 1957 through 1963. Following his honorable discharge as a Specialist, Peterson owned and operated a retail food market in his hometown of Pleasantville for 26 years. Peterson also completed a 3-year Rural Leadership Program through Penn State University.

Peterson&#x27;s first public office was on his local borough council, where he served for eight years. He was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on November 8, 1977 In 1984, Peterson was elected to the Pennsylvania Senate where he served for 12 years, chairing both the Public Health and Welfare Committee and the Republican Policy Committee. While in the legislature, Peterson authored the Welfare Reform, Living Will, and AIDS Confidentiality legislation. He also created five Higher Education Councils in his district which enable students from rural areas to earn university degrees right in their own community.

In 1996, Peterson was elected to serve Pennsylvania&#x27;s Fifth Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a freshman Member of the Education and Workforce Committee, Peterson served on conference committees that made higher education more accessible to all Americans and improved the delivery system for technical education.

Peterson was appointed to the House Appropriations Committee in 1998, where he was a member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, the Subcommittee on the Interior and Environment as well as the Subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Peterson also served as co-chair of the Congressional Rural Caucus, a bipartisan coalition of more than 140 Members of Congress committed to strengthening and revitalizing rural communities across America. As the representative of Pennsylvania&#x27;s largest, most rural district, Peterson was committed to strengthening job creation and economic development strategies; improving access to quality, affordable health care; expanding the availability of new technologies and technical education in rural areas; and enhancing the quality of life for his constituents.

In recognition of his support for rural economic development, Peterson was presented with the Congressional Partnership Award by the National Association of Development Organizations. Peterson was also named Policymaker of the Year by the Association for Career and Technical Education, and was honored by the National Rural Health Association as their 2002 Legislator of the Year for his efforts to improve Medicare funding for rural hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers.

Peterson has been recognized by numerous other organizations including the National Association of Community Health Centers, the Pennsylvania Association of Home Health Agencies, the Seniors Coalition, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, Americans for Tax Reform, the Association of Consulting Foresters, and the Pennsylvania Recreation and Parks Society.

Peterson has been married to his wife, Saundra, for more than 30 years. They have a son and two granddaughters. Peterson is a Methodist.

==Environmental record==
Peterson received the lowest possible environmental rating from the League of Conservation Voters in 2006, casting what the group qualified as anti-environment votes on twelve out of twelve critical issues ranging from oil drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, salvage logging and logging roads, and the Clean Water Act, to the Toxics Release Inventory program and low-income energy assistance. The conservative environmental group Republicans for Environmental Protection singled out Peterson as &quot;Worst in the House in 2006&quot; on environmental issues. In addition to assigning the representative a score of zero for his voting record, REP censured him individually for &quot;efforts to remove the moratorium on Outer Continental Shelf gas drilling through the Interior appropriations process.&quot; According to the League of Conservation Voters, &quot;natural gas drilling can create massive amounts of water and air pollution and can leave open the possibility of oil spills, which would be toxic for a wide variety of marine and coastal life.&quot;

==Energy record==

Peterson was among the most outspoken members of the U.S. House on increasing production of domestic energy, specifically natural gas. As a member of the Interior appropriations subcommittee, Peterson worked diligently to remove a 27-year-old moratorium on producing oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). He has been referred to by President George W. Bush, who he has routinely taken on, as &quot;Mr. Energy&quot; and introduced the first energy production bill in the 110th House (2007–08)--the National Environment and Energy Development (NEED) Act, which is a natural gas production only bill.

On July 31, 2008, Peterson and Rep. Neil Abercrombie (D-Hawaii) introduced the first bipartisan energy production bill in the 110th Congress. The National Conservation, Environment and Energy Independence Act, H.R. 6709, would transform the environment, and according to its supporters, put America on the road to energy independence. While locking up the first 25 miles of coastline and giving states the option to lock up an additional 25 miles, this legislation would remove the congressional moratorium on offshore energy production and use the royalties gained from that production to develop next generation alternative and renewable energy sources.

==Retirement==
In January 2008, Peterson announced he would be retiring from Congress at the end of his sixth term. Glenn Thompson, a Republican, won Peterson&#x27;s seat in the 2008 elections.

On the night of that day Lord Shiva appeared in her dream and told her that she need not come to Varanasi to see him, he himself will come and reside in Hiriyur. As promised, Lord Shiva was believed to have incarnated in the &quot;oraLukallu&quot; (a stone of cylindrical shape used in the households of ancient India for grinding purpose). That stone which was worshipped by Mallamma later became known as Terumalleshwara.

The ancient name of Hiriyur was &quot;Ghanapuri&quot;. The &quot;Yeppattu Kannina Setuve&quot; (&quot;the seventy eyed bridge&quot;) located near Hiriyur is noted for its architecture. The patterns in the bridge resemble human eye, and there are seventy eyes.

==Geography==
Hiriyur is located at . It has an average elevation of 630 metres (2066 feet). The months of March and April are the hottest months of the year. The Vedavati River is dammed here to meet the water needs of the otherwise mostly dry district of Chitradurga.

===National Geological monument===
Pillow lava rocks at Mardihalli village near Hiriyur has been declared as the National Geological Monuments of India by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), for their protection, maintenance, promotion and enhancement of Geotourism.

==Demographics==
According to 2011 Census of India, Hiriyur had a population of 56,416. Males constitute 49.85% of the population and females 50.15%. Hiriyur has an average literacy rate of 83.63%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 88.48%, and female literacy is 78.85%. In Hiriyur, 10.44% of the population is under 6 years of age.

== Transportation ==
This place lies on NH-48, the Mumbai-Bangalore National Highway, and is a central place for most commuters travelling to southern and central parts of India via Karnataka. Several villages around Hiriyur like Adivala, have been major producers of coconuts.

<text>Memoirs Found in a Bathtub (a literal translation of the original Polish-language title: &quot;Pamiętnik znaleziony w wannie&quot;) is a science fiction novel by Polish writer Stanisław Lem, first published in 1961. It was first published in English in 1973; a second edition was published in 1986.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Memoirs Found in a Bathtub&quot; starts with the finding of a diary in the distant future. The introduction dwells on the difficulties of historical research on the fictional &#x27;Neogene Era&#x27;, &quot;the period of the heyday of the pre-Chaotic culture, which preceded the Great Decomposition&quot;. &quot;Great Decomposition&quot; refers to the apocalyptic event of &quot;papyrolysis&quot;, decomposition of all paper on the planet in the pre-information-technology era, causing all records and money to turn into dust––the end of the &quot;epoch of papycracy&quot;.

The diary, known as the &#x27;Notes of a Man from the Neogene&#x27;, was found in the lava-filled ruins of Third Pentagon within the territory of the disappeared state of Ammer-Ka. Previously, little was known about the hypothetical &#x27;Last Pentagon&#x27;. One researcher suggested that Pentagon was a kind of military brain, the center in charge of maintaining the faith of Cap-i-Taal, dominant in Ammer-Ka in the period of U-S. This was confirmed by the finding of the diary, supposedly of an agent trapped deep within the subterranean bowels of the vast Third Pentagon, although the authenticity and authorship of the document were questioned by some researchers.

The rest of the book is the diary itself. In a Kafkaesque maelstrom of terrifying bureaucratic confusion and utter insanity, the agent attempts to follow his mission directives, conducting on-the-spot investigations: &quot;Verify. Search. Destroy. Incite. Inform. Over and out. On the &quot;n&quot;th day &quot;n&quot;th hour sector &quot;n&quot; subsector &quot;n&quot; rendezvous with N.&quot; The narrator inhabits a paranoid dystopia where nothing is as it seems, chaos seems to rule all events, and everyone is deeply suspicious of everyone else.

==Commentary==
Theodore Sturgeon described &quot;Memoirs Found in a Bathtub&quot; as &quot;A well-wrought nightmare indeed.&quot;

Lem himself describes the book as a &quot;combination of grim weirdness with humor&quot;. He writes that the novel goes beyond casual political satire: it puts forth the &quot;totalization of the notion of intentionality&quot;. Explaining the concept, he writes that everything which humans perceive may be interpreted by them as a message, and that a number of &quot;-isms&quot; are based on interpreting the whole Universe as a message to its inhabitants. This interpretation may be exploited for political purposes and then run amok beyond their intentions.

The title alludes to Jan Potocki&#x27;s novel &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;.

<doc id="963844" wikidata="Q5899474" url="?curid=963844" title="Hope Slide">
<text>The Hope Slide was a landslide that occurred in the morning hours of January 9, 1965 in the Nicolum Valley () in the Cascade Mountains near Hope, British Columbia and killed four people. The volume of rock involved in the landslide has been estimated at 47 million cubic metres. It is one of the two largest recorded landslides in Canada (along with the similarly sized 2010 Mount Meager landslide).

==Prior avalanche==
A few hours prior to the landslide, a small avalanche had forced five people to stop a few miles southeast of the town of Hope, British Columbia— east of Vancouver—on a stretch of the Hope-Princeton Highway below Johnson Peak.

==Landslide==
Two earthquakes were recorded in the general area of the slide. One quake occurred at 3:56 am and the second at 6:58 am. The slide that obliterated the mountain&#x27;s southwestern slope was discovered when members of the RCMP detachment at Hope were dispatched to what were reported as a couple of small rock slides. The first news reports of the slide were from CHWK Radio in Chilliwack where morning news reporter Gerald Pash and later news director Edgar Wilson filed voice reports with Broadcast News and The Canadian Press.

The slide completely displaced the ice and mud in Outram Lake below with incredible force, throwing it against the opposite side of the valley, wiping all vegetation and trees down to the bare rock, then splashed back up the original, now bare, slope before settling. Recent research shows that these impacts against the opposite valley sides produced the seismic signatures interpreted as earthquakes.

The slide buried a 1959 yellow Chevrolet convertible that had become stuck in the first slide, an Arrow Transfer oil tanker truck, and a loaded hay truck that had stopped behind the tanker under a torrent of 47 million cubic metres of pulverized rock, mud, and debris deep and wide, which came down the mountainside.

Norman Stephanishin, the Arrow truck driver, had stopped behind the stuck convertible. Stephanishin, unable to turn his rig around on the narrow and icy road, tried to talk the four others into walking the five kilometres back to Sumallo Lodge. Unable to convince them, Stephanishin walked east to Sumallo Lodge to phone the British Columbia Department of Highways. In a short distance, Stephanishin flagged down a Greyhound Canada bus travelling to Vancouver and persuaded the driver, David Hughes, to return with him to Sumallo Lodge. Hughes turned back and is credited with saving his passengers from a tragedy.

Rescue workers from Hope and Princeton found the body of Thomas Starchuck, 39, of Aldergrove, driver of the hay truck. The body of Bernie Lloyd Beck, 27, of Penticton, driver of the convertible was also retrieved. Beck&#x27;s passengers, Dennis George Arlitt, 23, of Penticton, and Mary Kalmakoff, 21, of Shoreacres, were never recovered. 

Phil Gaglardi, the British Columbia Minister of Highways, attended the scene and directed the construction of a temporary tote road over the southern portion of the slide. In twenty-one days a bumpy route had been established over the slide.

==Cause==
The landslide was caused by the presence of pre-existing tectonic structures (faults and shear zones) within the southwestern slope of Johnson Ridge. The lower parts of the slide scar are underlain by felsite sheets (which may have failed first) while the upper parts of the slide scar are underlain by highly jointed Paleozoic greenstone beds. Ongoing weathering and tectonic activity weakened the slide mass to the point where it had reached limiting equilibrium. Johnson Peak was the site of a previous smaller prehistoric rock-slide.

Just what triggered the 1965 landslide remains unclear; the two so-called earthquakes were likely too small to trigger the slide and thus the seismic events were more likely caused by the impact of the landslide masses on the opposite valley wall. Changes in groundwater condition, often a trigger for landslides, is not thought to have played a role in the Hope Slide as the slide occurred during a protracted period of sub-zero temperatures in the winter, though some have suggested that freezing of seepage exit points may have caused an increase in water pressure at the toe of the slide.

==Result==
In places, the slide buried parts of the area below in up to 152 m (500 ft) of rocks, mud, and debris. About 3.5 kilometres of the highway were destroyed and it took 13 days for Department of Highways&#x27; workers to re-establish the route. The highway has since been rerouted further away from the slide location, around and over the base of the slide&#x27;s debris field 55 metres above the original ground level on the other side of valley. Though much of the massive scar on the mountain face remains bare rock, vegetation including trees are growing over parts of the slide area. 

A rest area for Highway 3 now exists at the slide area, which includes a memorial and a view point that allows tourists to view the scar.

<doc id="963848" wikidata="Q3547022" url="?curid=963848" title="Tole painting">
<text>Tole painting is the folk art of decorative painting on tin and wooden utensils, objects and furniture. Typical metal objects include utensils, coffee pots, and similar household items. Wooden objects include tables, chairs, and chests, including hope chests, toyboxes and jewelry boxes.

With a longer history in Europe (see toleware), in America the practice began in 18th century New England, and was also extensively carried on among German immigrants in Pennsylvania. A separate, related tradition occurs in the Netherlands and among Scandinavian countries and immigrants, including Norwegians, Danes and Swedes. German tole painting may concentrate more on metal and tin objects, while Scandinavians and Netherlanders may concentrate more on wooden objects and furniture. Patterns in the two traditions vary slightly as well.

Modern tole painting typically uses inexpensive, long-lasting and sturdy acrylic paints. Good quality wooden work is sealed, primed and sanded before the decorative paint is applied.

The most beloved family objects tend to be high quality utensils or furniture, painted freehand with favorite patterns, colors or flowers, humorous themes, family in-jokes, or illustrations of favorite or family stories. The perceived value of a tolled utensil increases with its quality as a utensil, the quality of the art, and the personalization, the story, of the work.

An advantage of tole painting as a craft is that a bad painting can be sanded off and repainted. One of the signs of such repaintings is a black-backgrounded tole-painted object. Very often such objects are repainted, especially if the furniture or utensil is valuable and the painter is inexperienced.

== Modern history ==
Tole painting experienced a resurgence in the 1960s when teachers began opening studios in cities around the United States. One notable teacher is Priscilla Hauser of Tulsa, Oklahoma. After opening Priscilla&#x27;s Little Red Tole House in 1968, she began to organize teachers and studios around the midwest, trained students to become teachers, and in 1972 began the National Society of Tole and Decorative Painters, which would eventually become the Society of Decorative Painters. Tole painting is now a worldwide phenomenon, largely due to the international expansion of the now 50-year-old Society of Decorative Painters.

<text>The Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt (&quot;Rödelheim Hard-Rhyme Project&quot;), for short RHP, was a mid-1990s German rap group from Rödelheim, a part of Frankfurt. The group comprised two members, Moses P. (Moses Pelham) and Thomas H. (Thomas Hofmann). They were among the first groups to garner commercial success by rapping in German, while stylistically leaning more towards American gangsta rap.

== Band history ==
Moses Pelham had already had moderate success as a teenager with his first English language single &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; in 1989, before hitting a brick wall in his attempts to market his self-produced second album. In 1993 he teamed up with his old friend Thomas Hofmann, whom he had met on a basketball court, to form the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt. They recorded their album that year with producers Martin Haas, who had worked on Moses&#x27;s unreleased second album, and Robert Sattler and supported by future stars Xavier Naidoo and Sabrina Setlur. The album, entitled &quot;Direkt aus Rödelheim&quot; (&quot;Straight out of Rödelheim&quot;, an allusion to N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;), surprisingly sold an impressive 160,000 copies in 1994. In 1995, when Schwester S. (a.k.a. Sabrina Setlur) released her debut album, RHP collaborated with her on the single &quot;Ja Klar&quot; (&quot;Yeah, right&quot;) which entered the Top 10 of the German Media Control charts.

In 1996 the group released their second and last album, &quot;Zurück nach Rödelheim&quot; (&quot;Back to Rödelheim&quot;), which entered the charts at 3rd position and sold 180,000 copies. The first single extracted from the album, &quot;Höha, Schnella, Weita&quot; (&quot;Higha, Fasta, Furtha&quot;) received a lot of airplay and was also fairly successful. It was this year that Moses split with the group&#x27;s former label, Universal Music, for his own new label, Pelham Power Productions (3p). From around then on, RHP factually ceased to exist, while Moses Pelham now concentrated on marketing his label&#x27;s artists and on his own solo career.

<text>Vani Vilasa Sagara, popularly known as Mari Kanive is a dam in Hiriyur Taluk, Chitradurga District, in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is located about 20 km east of Hiriyur, 55 km south of Chitradurga, and 180 km north-west of Bengaluru.

Vani Vilasa Sagara was built by the Mysore Maharajas pre-independence across the river Vedavathi. Vani Vilasa Sagara is the oldest dam in the state. The dam is an exquisite piece of architecture, an engineering marvel for that time. The dam irrigates a large area of the Deccan region of Central Karnataka, which is otherwise largely a dry land. It irrigates more than 100 km2 of land in Hiriyur taluk through right and left bank canals. Vani Vilasa Sagara dam is also the source of domestic water for Hiriyur, Hosadurga Chitradurga and Challakere.

==History==
Vani Vilasa Sagara across the river Vedavathi was built by the Mysore Maharajas pre-independence. The project was initiated by the regent Queen Maharani Kempa Nanjammani Vani Vilasa Sannidhana who was a widow of Maharaja Chamaraaja Wadiyar. She is known for her exemplary social works. For the construction of this dam royals of Mysore had to pledge royal jewellery due to shortage of money, that is why it was named as &quot;Vani Vilasa Sagara&quot;. The Mari Kanive irrigation project was initiated by Sir. Mark Cubbon, the British Resident of Mysore. Further improvements to the dam was initiated by Diwan Sheshadri Iyer in 1897 at the order of His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV. Vani Vilasa Sagara is taller than KRS dam of Mysore.

==Features==
The dam is capable of storing 30Tmcft of water. The dam has full reservoir level(FRL) of 130 feet mark, but its water level is measurable up to 135 feet, which was attained only in the year 1933. The dam crossed 120 feet mark numerous times, namely in 1932, 1934, 1956, 1957, 1958, 2000, 2021 and 2022.
On September 2, 2022, milestone was reached after 89 years, when the dam was filled till brim at 130feet with inflow of over 3,000 cusecs.

==Upper Bhadra Project==
Due to insufficient water quantity in the reservoir, to cater the drinking and irrigation needs of people in Chitradurga district and eastern part of Chikkamagaluru district, the Government of Karnataka, has made a milestone project called Upper-Bhadra project. As per the project, out of 17 TMC ft. of water lifted from Tunga Gajanur Dam and 29.90 TMC ft. of water lifted from Bhadra Dam, 2 Tmcft is exclusively allotted to this dam.

==Tourism==
The dam has been a tourist attraction for many years, but has been apparently neglected as a prime tourist destination. Recently, though, the development work undertaken by the forest department to restore the nearby forest cover, and the &#x27;panchavati&#x27; gardens - a garden of medicinal plants with the old Indian cultural theme has improved the tourist figures, making it a popular weekend picnic spot. The &#x27;panchavati&#x27; garden has medicinal plants lined up representing cultural themes - the &#x27;Rashis&#x27;, &#x27;Sapta swaras&#x27;, &#x27;Nava grahas&#x27; and many more. The tourists who visit Chitradurga and Hosdurga often visit Mari kanive on the way. The historic maarikaamba temple here also attracts many tourists. The place is around 20 km drive from Hiriyur on a deviation from NH-48 (Bangalore - Mumbai National Highway).

The backwaters of the dam is tailormade for water sports. The Youth Services and Sports Department has chalked out a programme to draw more youngsters towards adventure sport in the region. With the help of General Thimayya Adventure Sports Academy, an adventure sport centre is being planned at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore.

<text>Alarm management is the application of human factors and ergonomics along with instrumentation engineering and systems thinking to manage the design of an alarm system to increase its usability. Most often the major usability problem is that there are too many alarms annunciated in a plant upset, commonly referred to as alarm flood (similar to an interrupt storm), since it is so similar to a flood caused by excessive rainfall input with a basically fixed drainage output capacity. However, there can also be other problems with an alarm system such as poorly designed alarms, improperly set alarm points, ineffective annunciation, unclear alarm messages, etc. Poor alarm management is one of the leading causes of unplanned downtime, contributing to over $20B in lost production every year, and of major industrial incidents. Developing good alarm management practices is not a discrete activity, but more of a continuous process (i.e., it is more of a journey than a destination).

==Alarm problem history==
From their conception, large chemical, refining, power generation, and other processing plants required the use of a control system to keep the process operating successfully and producing products. Due to the fragility of the components as compared to the process, these control systems often required a control room to protect them from the elements and process conditions. In the early days of control rooms, they used what were referred to as &quot;panel boards&quot; which were loaded with control instruments and indicators. These were tied to sensors located in the process streams and on the outside of process equipment. The sensors relayed their information to the control instruments via analogue signals, such as a 4-20 mA current loop in the form of twisted pair wiring. At first these systems merely yielded information, and a well-trained operator was required to make adjustments either by changing flow rates, or altering energy inputs to keep the process within its designed limits.

Alarms were added to alert the operator to a condition that was about to exceed a design limit, or had already exceeded a design limit. Additionally, shutdown systems were employed to halt a process that was in danger of exceeding either safety, environmental or monetarily acceptable process limits. Alarm were indicated to the operator by annunciator horns, and lights of different colours. (For instance, green lights meant OK, Yellow meant not OK, and Red meant BAD.) Panel boards were usually laid out in a manner that replicated the process flow in the plant. So instrumentation indicating operating units with the plant was grouped together for recognition sake and ease of problem solution. It was a simple matter to look at the entire panel board, and discern whether any section of the plant was running poorly. This was due to both the design of the instruments and the implementation of the alarms associated with the instruments. Instrumentation companies put a lot of effort into the design and individual layout of the instruments they manufactured. To do this they employed behavioural psychology practices which revealed how much information a human being could collect in a quick glance. More complex plants had more complex panel boards, and therefore often more human operators or controllers.

Thus, in the early days of panel board systems, alarms were regulated by both size and cost. In essence, they were limited by the amount of available board space, and the cost of running wiring, and hooking up an annunciator (horn), indicator (light) and switches to flip to acknowledge, and clear a resolved alarm. It was often the case that if a new alarm was needed, an old one had to be given up.

As technology developed, the control system and control methods were tasked to continue to advance a higher degree of plant automation with each passing year. Highly complex material processing called for highly complex control methodologies. Also, global competition pushed manufacturing operations to increase production while using less energy, and producing less waste. In the days of the panel boards, a special kind of engineer was required to understand a combination of the electronic equipment associated with process measurement and control, the control algorithms necessary to control the process (PID basics), and the actual process that was being used to make the products. Around the mid 80&#x27;s, we entered the digital revolution. Distributed control systems (DCS) were a boon to the industry. The engineer could now control the process without having to understand the equipment necessary to perform the control functions. Panel boards were no longer required, because all of the information that once came across analogue instruments could be digitised, stuffed into a computer and manipulated to achieve the same control actions once performed with amplifiers and potentiometers.

As a side effect, that also meant that alarms were easy and cheap to configure and deploy. You simply typed in a location, a value to alarm on and set it to active. The unintended result was that soon people alarmed everything. Initial installers set an alarm at 80% and 20% of the operating range of any variable just as a habit. The integration of programmable logic controllers, safety instrumented systems, and packaged equipment controllers has been accompanied by an overwhelming increase in associated alarms. One other unfortunate part of the digital revolution was that what once covered several square yards of panel space, now had to be fit into a 17-inch computer monitor. Multiple pages of information was thus employed to replicate the information on the replaced panel board. Alarms were used to tell an operator to go look at a page he was not viewing. Alarms were used to tell an operator that a tank was filling. Every mistake made in operations usually resulted in a new alarm. With the implementation of the OSHA 1910 regulations, HAZOPS studies usually requested several new alarms. Alarms were everywhere. Incidents began to accrue as a combination of too much data collided with too little useful information.

==Alarm management history==
Recognizing that alarms were becoming a problem, industrial control system users banded together and formed the Alarm Management Task Force, which was a customer advisory board led by Honeywell in 1990. The AMTF included participants from chemical, petrochemical, and refining operations. They gathered and wrote a document on the issues associated with alarm management. This group quickly realised that alarm problems were simply a subset of a larger problem, and formed the Abnormal Situation Management Consortium (ASM is a registered trademark of Honeywell). The ASM Consortium developed a research proposal and was granted funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1994. The focus of this work was addressing the complex human-system interaction and factors that influence successful performance for process operators. Automation solutions have often been developed without consideration of the human that needs to interact with the solution. In particular, alarms are intended to improve situation awareness for the control room operator, but a poorly configured alarm system does not achieve this goal. 

The ASM Consortium has produced documents on best practices in alarm management, as well as operator situation awareness, operator effectiveness, and other operator-oriented issues. These documents were originally for ASM Consortium members only, but the ASMC has recently offered these documents publicly.

The ASM consortium also participated in development of an alarm management guideline published by the Engineering Equipment &amp; Materials Users&#x27; Association (EEMUA) in the UK. The ASM Consortium provided data from their member companies, and contributed to the editing of the guideline. The result is EEMUA 191 &quot;Alarm Systems- A Guide to Design, Management and Procurement&quot;.

Several institutions and societies are producing standards on alarm management to assist their members in the best practices use of alarms in industrial manufacturing systems. Among them are the ISA (ISA 18.2), API (API 1167) and NAMUR (Namur NA 102). Several companies also offer software packages to assist users in dealing with alarm management issues. Among them are DCS manufacturing companies, and third-party vendors who offer add-on systems.

==Concepts==
The fundamental purpose of alarm annunciation is to alert the operator to deviations from normal operating conditions, i.e. abnormal operating situations. The ultimate objective is to prevent, or at least minimise, physical and economic loss through operator intervention in response to the condition that was alarmed. For most digital control system users, losses can result from situations that threaten environmental safety, personnel safety, equipment integrity, economy of operation, and product quality control as well as plant throughput. A key factor in operator response effectiveness is the speed and accuracy with which the operator can identify the alarms that require immediate action.

By default, the assignment of alarm trip points and alarm priorities constitute basic alarm management. Each individual alarm is designed to provide an alert when that process indication deviates from normal. The main problem with basic alarm management is that these features are static. The resultant alarm annunciation does not respond to changes in the mode of operation or the operating conditions.

When a major piece of process equipment like a charge pump, compressor, or fired heater shuts down, many alarms become unnecessary. These alarms are no longer independent exceptions from normal operation. They indicate, in that situation, secondary, non-critical effects and no longer provide the operator with important information. Similarly, during start-up or shutdown of a process unit, many alarms are not meaningful. This is often the case because the static alarm conditions conflict with the required operating criteria for start-up and shutdown.

In all cases of major equipment failure, start-ups, and shutdowns, the operator must search alarm annunciation displays and analyse which alarms are significant. This wastes valuable time when the operator needs to make important operating decisions and take swift action. If the resultant flood of alarms becomes too great for the operator to comprehend, then the basic alarm management system has failed as a system that allows the operator to respond quickly and accurately to the alarms that require immediate action. In such cases, the operator has virtually no chance to minimise, let alone prevent, a significant loss.

In short, one needs to extend the objectives of alarm management beyond the basic level. It is not sufficient to utilise multiple priority levels because priority itself is often dynamic. Likewise, alarm disabling based on unit association or suppressing audible annunciation based on priority do not provide dynamic, selective alarm annunciation. The solution must be an alarm management system that can dynamically filter the process alarms based on the current plant operation and conditions so that only the currently significant alarms are annunciated.

The fundamental purpose of dynamic alarm annunciation is to alert the operator to relevant abnormal operating situations. They include situations that have a necessary or possible operator response to ensure:
*Personnel and Environmental Safety,
*Equipment Integrity,
*Product Quality Control.
The ultimate objectives are no different from the previous basic alarm annunciation management objectives. Dynamic alarm annunciation management focuses the operator&#x27;s attention by eliminating extraneous alarms, providing better recognition of critical problems, and insuring swifter, more accurate operator response.

==The need for alarm management==
Alarm management is usually necessary in a manufacturing environment that is controlled by an operator using a supervisory control system, such as a DCS, a SCADA or a programmable logic controller (PLC). Such a system may have hundreds of individual alarms that up until very recently have probably been designed with only limited consideration of other alarms in the system. Since humans can only do one thing at a time and can pay attention to a limited number of things at a time, there needs to be a way to ensure that alarms are presented at a rate that can be assimilated by a human operator, particularly when the plant is upset or in an unusual condition. Alarms also need to be capable of directing the operator&#x27;s attention to the most important problem that he or she needs to act upon, using a priority to indicate degree of importance or rank, for instance. To ensure a continuous production, a seamless service, a perfect quality at any time of day or night, there must be an organisation which implies several teams of people handling, one after the other, the occurring events.

This is more commonly called the on-call management. The on-call management relies on a team of one or more persons (site manager, maintenance staff) or on external organisation (guards, telesurveillance centre). To avoid having a full-time person to monitor a single process or a level, information and / or events transmission is mandatory. This information transmission will enable the on-call staff to be more mobile, more efficient and will allow it to perform other tasks at the same time.

==Some improvement methods==
The techniques for achieving rate reduction range from the extremely simple ones of reducing nuisance and low value alarms to redesigning the alarm system in a holistic way that considers the relationships among individual alarms.

===Design guide===
This step involves documenting the methodology or philosophy of how to design alarms. It can include things such as what to alarm, standards for alarm annunciation and text messages, how the operator will interact with the alarms.

===Rationalization and Documentation===
This phase is a detailed review of all alarms to document their design purpose, and to ensure that they are selected and set properly and meet the design criteria. Ideally this stage will result in a reduction of alarms, but doesn&#x27;t always.

===Advanced methods===
The above steps will often still fail to prevent an alarm flood in an operational upset, so advanced methods such as alarm suppression under certain circumstances are then necessary. As an example, shutting down a pump will always cause a low flow alarm on the pump outlet flow, so the low flow alarm may be suppressed if the pump was shut down since it adds no value for the operator, because he or she already knows it was caused by the pump being shut down. This technique can of course get very complicated and requires considerable care in design. In the above case for instance, it can be argued that the low flow alarm does add value as it confirms to the operator that the pump has indeed stopped. Process boundaries (Boundary Management) must also be taken into account.

Alarm management becomes more and more necessary as the complexity and size of manufacturing systems increases. A lot of the need for alarm management also arises because alarms can be configured on a DCS at nearly zero incremental cost, whereas in the past on physical control panel systems that consisted of individual pneumatic or electronic analogue instruments, each alarm required expenditure and control panel area, so more thought usually went into the need for an alarm. Numerous disasters such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl accident and the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; have established a clear need for alarm management.

==The seven steps to alarm management==
Step 1: Create and adopt an alarm philosophy

A comprehensive design and guideline document is produced which defines a plant standard employing a best-practise alarm management methodology.

Step 2: Alarm performance benchmarking

Analyze the alarm system to determine its strengths and deficiencies, and effectively map out a practical solution to improve it.

Step 3: “Bad actor” alarm resolution

From experience, it is known that around half of the entire alarm load usually comes from a relatively few alarms. The methods for making them work properly are documented, and can be applied with minimum effort and maximum performance improvement.

Step 4: Alarm documentation and rationalisation (D&amp;R)

A full overhaul of the alarm system to ensure that each alarm complies with the alarm philosophy and the principles of good alarm management.

Step 5: Alarm system audit and enforcement

DCS alarm systems are notoriously easy to change and generally lack proper security. Methods are needed to ensure that the alarm system does not drift from its rationalised state.

Step 6: Real-time alarm management

More advanced alarm management techniques are often needed to ensure that the alarm system properly supports, rather than hinders, the operator in all operating scenarios. These include Alarm Shelving, State-Based Alarming, and Alarm Flood Suppression technologies.

Step 7: Control and maintain alarm system performance

Proper management of change and longer term analysis and KPI monitoring are needed, to ensure that the gains that have been achieved from performing the steps above do not dwindle away over time. Otherwise they will; the principle of “entropy” definitely applies to an alarm system.

<text>Lawrence Lemieux (born 12 November 1955, in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian sailor, who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in the Star class and at the 1988 Summer Olympics in the Finn class. He was recognized for his noble actions in the latter competition.

== Biography ==
Lemieux grew up sailing on Wabamun Lake west of Edmonton with his five older brothers. He began racing solo boats in the 1970s.

=== 1988 Olympic rescue ===
On 24 September 1988, the sailing competition was underway at Busan Yachting Center, from South Korea&#x27;s capital of Seoul, the main Olympic site. At the time, the 470 and Finn classes were running races on their respective courses. The wind suddenly picked up, blowing , and the Singapore team&#x27;s 470 dinghy with Joseph Chan and Siew Shaw Her aboard capsized. The men were thrown from the boat as it heeled over and were injured and in need of assistance. At this time, Lemieux was running the fifth of the seven total races to determine the medalists in the Finn class and was in second place in that race. Near the halfway point of his race, Lemieux spotted the turtled Singaporean boat and deviated from his course to assist in rescuing Chan and Siew. After pulling them from the water, Lemieux waited for a patrol boat to take the rescued sailors back to shore. Once that happened, he rejoined the Finn fleet, finishing in 22nd place in a field of 32 boats. However, due to his actions, the International Yacht Racing Union decided to reinstate Lemieux&#x27;s position when he went off course, rewarding him with a second-place finish in his race. Despite this, Lemieux went on to place eleventh in the class.

At a special ceremony on 28 September 1988, in attendance of Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, Peter Tallberg, president of the International Yacht Racing Union, and Constantine II of Greece, himself an able yachtsman having won a gold medal in the Dragon class at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Lemieux&#x27;s heroic act was acknowledged, with Samaranch saying, &quot;By your sportsmanship, self-sacrifice and courage, you embody all that is right with the Olympic ideal.&quot; Many 21st century sources, including &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, BBC Sport, &quot;Inside the Games&quot;, CBC Sports, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Bustle&quot;,&quot;Smithsonian&quot;, &quot;India Today&quot;, &quot;Mental Floss&quot;, and &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, as well as the Canadian Olympic Committee, have peddled as a fact that Lemieux received the Pierre de Coubertin Medal, although the Medal was inaugurated nine years later in 1997. The International Olympic Committee has said he did not receive it. In CBC Sports video footage from 1988, Lemieux shows the &quot;special price&quot;, a small blue trinket box with the Seoul Olympics logo on the hinged lid, and not quite sure what to call it says &quot;it&#x27;s a jar of some sort.&quot;

== Post-retirement ==
Lemieux has since retired from professional sailing and is now a coach. In 2008, he was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame. Asked in a 2012 interview if he would rather be talking about the medal he might have won instead of the rescue, Lemieux referred to sailing&#x27;s lack of a high media profile: &quot;You spend your life working really hard internationally and you get very few accolades. So that&#x27;s the ironic thing; 25 years after this rescue, we&#x27;re still talking about it.&quot; As of 2020, Lemieux was living at Seba Beach, Alberta.

<text>The University of South Carolina (USC, South Carolina, or Carolina) is a public research university in Columbia, South Carolina, United States. Founded in 1801 as South Carolina College, It is the flagship of the University of South Carolina System and the largest university in the state by enrollment. Its main campus is on over in downtown Columbia, close to the South Carolina State House. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities with Highest Research Activity&quot;. It houses the largest collection of Robert Burns and Scottish literature materials outside Scotland and the world&#x27;s largest Ernest Hemingway collection.

==History==
===Foundation and early history===

The university was founded as South Carolina College on December 19, 1801, by an act of the South Carolina General Assembly initiated by Governor John Drayton in an effort to promote harmony between the Lowcountry and the Backcountry. On January 10, 1805, having an initial enrollment of nine students, the college commenced classes with a traditional classical curriculum. The first president was the Baptist minister and theologian Reverend Jonathan Maxcy. He was an alumnus of Brown University, with an honorary degree from Harvard University. Before coming to the college, Maxcy had served as the second president of Brown and the third president of Union College. Maxcy&#x27;s tenure lasted from 1804 through 1820.

When South Carolina College opened its doors in 1805, the building now known as Rutledge College was the only building on campus. Located one block southeast of the State Capitol, it served as an administrative office, academic building, residence hall, and chapel. However, the master plan for the original campus called for a total of eleven buildings, all facing a large lush gathering area. In 1807, the original President&#x27;s House was the next building to be erected. The building now known as DeSaussure College followed shortly thereafter, and the remaining eight buildings were constructed over the next several decades. When completed, all eleven buildings formed a U-shape open to Sumter Street. This modified quadrangle became known as the Horseshoe.

As with other southern universities in the antebellum period, the most important organizations for students were the two literary societies, the Clariosophic Society and the Euphradian Society. These two societies, which arose from a split in an earlier literary society known as the Philomathic, grew to encapsulate the majority of the student body from the 1820s onward.

The college became a symbol of the South in the antebellum period as its graduates were on the forefront of secession from the Union. With the generous support of the General Assembly, South Carolina College acquired a reputation as the leading institution of the South and attracted several noteworthy scholars, including Francis Lieber, Thomas Cooper, and Joseph LeConte.

Slavery and slave labor played a fundamental role in the foundation and construction of the University of South Carolina. Many of the primary buildings in the central heart of campus, known today as the horseshoe, were built not only by slave labor but also of slave-made brick. Slave labor played a large role in the maintenance operational duties of early campus activities. This includes maintenance, cleaning of student tenements and faculty duplexes, and the preparation of meals.

===Civil War===
Seventy-two students were present for classes in January 1862 and the college functioned until a call by the Confederate government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers. A system of conscription began on March 20 for all men between the ages of 18 and 45, but many students volunteered. With the depletion of students, professors issued a notice that the college would open to those under 18 years old. Nine students showed up for class.

===Post-war===
The University Act of 1869 during the Reconstruction era reorganized the university and provided it with generous financial support. An amendment was added to the act by W. J. Whipper, a black representative from Beaufort, that would prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the university. The legislature further proved its seriousness towards racial equality by electing two black trustees, Benjamin A. Boseman (misspelled as &quot;Bozeman&quot; in the bill) and Francis Lewis Cardozo, to the governing board of the university on March 9, 1869. A normal school was established by the legislature on the campus of the university as well as a preparatory school for black students, since most former slaves were ill-prepared for academic work. In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished. On October 7, 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Secretary of State of South Carolina, became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the university.

===Post-Reconstruction (Jim Crow era)===
In 1877 South Carolina state leaders closed the university. It was reopened in 1880 as a white only agricultural college.

==Campus==
The Horseshoe is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and most of its buildings reflect the federal style of architecture in vogue in the early days of the nation. Among them is the South Caroliniana Library, which was designed by Robert Mills and is the first freestanding academic library in the United States.

Over the years the 11 original buildings on the Horseshoe survived a fire, an earthquake, and the Civil War, but in 1939 McKissick Museum replaced the original President&#x27;s House. The President&#x27;s House would eventually return to the Horseshoe after extensive remodeling of one of its original buildings, which was dedicated as such in 1952.

During the 20th century: the campus began to spread out dramatically from the Horseshoe. Today it includes the student union, 24 residence halls, numerous academic buildings, Longstreet Theatre, the Koger Center for the Arts, the Carolina Coliseum, the Colonial Life Arena, Carolina Stadium, and various facilities for Olympic sports. (Williams-Brice Stadium is located approximately one mile off campus.) Recent additions to the campus are the Strom Thurmond Wellness and Fitness Center, the Greek Village, the Green Quad, the Honors Residence Hall, the Public Health Research Center, the Graduate Columbia hotel, the Colonial Life Arena and Carolina Stadium. In 2017, a new School of Law building opened on Senate Street, and the Darla Moore School of Business opened its new home at the corner of Assembly and Greene in 2014.

The &quot;Carolina Cab&quot; offers students free rides from Five Points to their homes within of campus on weekends.

==Academics==

=== Colleges and schools ===
===Undergraduate admissions===
Undergraduate admissions are classified as &quot;more selective&quot;. For the freshman enrollment of 2022, half the class had SAT scores between 1150 and 1360, or ACT scores between 26 and 31.

===South Carolina Honors College===
Founded in 1978, the South Carolina Honors College offers support to academically gifted undergraduate students. After gaining acceptance to the University of South Carolina, students must apply separately to the Honors College and demonstrate significant academic achievement. In 2019, entering freshmen had an average weighted GPA of 4.71 and a midrange SAT score (critical reading and math) of 1460–1530.

===Rankings===



==Research==
The University of South Carolina is classified as a research institution of &quot;very high research activity&quot;. The university was awarded $309 million in sponsored awards during the 2024 fiscal year, a 27 percent increase in research funding from the previous year.

During his tenure as president of the University of South Carolina, John Palms articulated a &quot;Cathedrals of Excellence&quot; budgeting philosophy. Palms advocated the money from fundraising be channeled into the school&#x27;s best programs, rather than spread the funds evenly. The strategy would pay off in the long term when these programs became nationally prominent, making a name for the University of South Carolina and attracting grant money. His primary goal was for the university to be admitted to the Association of American Universities – an association of the leading 62 research universities in the United States and Canada.

Former President Andrew Sorensen raised even larger sums for research, including a $300 million grant for colorectal cancer. In the spirit of Palms&#x27; budget, the board of directors moved to transform university land on Assembly Street into an &quot;innovation district&quot; called Innovista that will develop four areas: biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental science and alternative fuels.

In May 2009, the University of South Carolina was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of 31 universities nationwide to house an Energy Frontier Research Center that is expected to bring $12.5 million in federal funding, the largest single award in the university&#x27;s history, to the College of Engineering and Computing. President Pastides commented on the grant, &quot;This award solidifies the university&#x27;s position as a leader in alternative-fuel research.&quot;

The University of South Carolina is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the SECU, the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship and achievement amongst the member universities in the Southeastern conference. The SECU bolsters collaborative academic endeavors of Southeastern Conference universities. Its goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC faculty, students and its universities and advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities.

==Student life==
===Demographics===
Over 34,500 students attend the Columbia campus of the University of South Carolina, coming from all 46 South Carolina counties. In addition, students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries are represented here. (Almost 16,000 students study at the regional campuses of the University of South Carolina System.)

===Housing===
University Housing provides over 6,200 on-campus housing units. Rent includes all utilities. Undergraduates may choose housing in a specific &quot;living and learning community&quot;. The concept is to create a better social and learning environment by housing students with similar academic or career interests together.

In the fall of 2004, the $29 million West Quad (now Green Quad) opened and became one of only four in the world to be certified by the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. The complex includes three four-story buildings.

Since campus academic enrollment exceeds the capacity of on-campus housing, the university is adding more residence halls, most of which will be suite-style. As a result, some students live in popular off-campus housing.

===Student government===
The university&#x27;s student government is composed of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. A 50-member Student Senate is led by the student body speaker of the Senate. The Student Senate enacts referendums, resolutions, and bills to enhance the student body in non-academic fields, maintains a budget for student life projects, confirms nominations for cabinet positions, and makes recommendations for change within the university. Their work is arranged according to the Student Government Constitution, a document written and adopted with the inception of student government and overseen by the President of the University of South Carolina and the university&#x27;s board of trustees.

&quot;The Daily Gamecock&quot; is an editorially independent, daily student newspaper founded in 1908. It has a readership of more than 30,000 and is distributed across the University of South Carolina System.

The student run radio station, WUSC, began broadcasting on the AM dial in 1947. In January 1977 WUSC began broadcasting on the FM dial, and in 1982 the station found its current home at 90.5 FM. Since June 2006, WUSC is broadcasting in HD radio.

Students publish a literary magazine, &quot;Garnet &amp; Black&quot;, which was formed in 1994 as a consolidation of the university&#x27;s former yearbook and its literary magazine. It is published four times a year and is free.

The University of South Carolina established its first television station in the Fall 2006, Student Government Television (SGTV). It was funded by Student Government until April 2007 when Student Government released SGTV to the Department of Student Media, which also operates &quot;The Daily Gamecock&quot;, &quot;Garnet &amp; Black&quot; Magazine and WUSC-FM. It was then that the station changed its name to it current name, Student Gamecock Television (SGTV).

===Fraternities and sororities===
About 22% of undergraduate men and 34% of undergraduate women participate in fraternities and sororities. These Greek letter organizations are governed by an internal body, the Greek Council. There are two separate councils, one for males and another for females. Many of the fraternities and sororities have large, mostly Greek Revival style mansions; Lining Lincoln Street, Gadsden Street, and Mark Buyck Way are the houses referred to as the Greek Village.

===Recreation===
Students tend to socialize off campus in Five Points and the Congaree Vista. Both of these areas are within walking distance of campus and offer restaurants, bars, cafés, and a variety of local entertainment.

Lake Murray and the three rivers (Saluda River, Broad River, and Congaree River) around Columbia offer students many recreational activities. The South Carolina coast—Charleston, SC, Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head—is only a 1.5- to 2-hour drive for additional recreational activities.

==Athletics==


The university offers club, intramural, and varsity sports. Its 19 varsity sports teams compete in the Southeastern Conference (except for men&#x27;s soccer which competes in the Sun Belt Conference and women&#x27;s sand volleyball which competes as an independent) and are known as the Gamecocks.

=== Fight song ===
The university&#x27;s band director James Pritchard obtained a band arrangement of the Elmer Bernstein-penned song &quot;Step to the Rear&quot; from the Broadway musical &quot;How Now, Dow Jones&quot; in 1968 and the marching band played the song at the first game of the 1968 season. It caught the ear of Coach Paul Dietzel who contacted Pritchard about making it the official fight song of the university to replace the original &quot;Carolina Fight Song&quot; (or &quot;Carolina Let Your Voices Ring,&quot; now called the &quot;Old Fight Song&quot;). Dietzel wrote the lyrics for the song, but asked that he remain anonymous because knowledge that the football coach wrote the lyrics might render it unacceptable to the basketball program. The song was officially introduced on November 16, 1968, prior to the football game against Virginia Tech and has been the fight song since the fall of 1969.

=== Alma mater ===
&quot;The Gamecock&quot; reported in its March 1911 issue that very little progress had been made on the alma mater for the university despite a reward of $50 by the faculty. English professor, George A. Wauchope, took it upon himself and wrote the lyrics for the alma mater in 1911 set to the tune &quot;Flow Gently, Sweet Afton&quot; by Robert Burns. Other songs were written and sung, but Wauchope&#x27;s song proved to be the most popular and it was adopted by the university in 1912.

The tradition has developed that alumni raise their right hand as though raising a cup for the phrase &quot;Here&#x27;s A Health, Carolina&quot; as if offering a toast.

==Notable alumni==

As of 2017, the university reported having over 300,000 living alumni.

<text>Nutting Associates was an arcade game manufacturer based in Mountain View, California, incorporated in February 1967 by William Gilbert Nutting. In 1977 the company was purchased by William &quot;Si&quot; Redd and eventually absorbed into the company Sircoma.

== History ==
Bill Nutting was working as a buyer at a San Francisco department store when his father-in-law, Revere Ware executive Herbert Ullmann, alerted him to an educational technology company called Edex Teaching Systems looking for investors. Nutting became a partner in the company, which created a coin-operated trivia game called the &quot;Knowledge Computer&quot; in 1964. Nutting marketed the machine for Edex and bought the rights to it after Edex was purchased by Raytheon in 1965. In January 1966, he founded Nutting Associates to market the Knowledge Computer and a redesigned version of the device called &quot;Computer Quiz&quot; (1967) created by Richard Ball of Marketing Services. In 1968 the model was redesigned into a solid-state version.

In 1971, Nolan Bushnell sold Nutting Associates on manufacturing the game &quot;Computer Space&quot; (1971). About 1,500 units were manufactured. Afterwards, Bushnell wanted a large ownership stake in the company to continue creating games for Nutting Associates, but left after not being given that opportunity to form Atari Inc. with Ted Dabney.

Nutting Associates continued manufacturing video games up until 1977 when the company was sold to &quot;Si&quot; Redd. A new Nutting Associates company was established in Nevada before being absorbed into the larger company Sircoma, a video poker manufacturer.

Nutting&#x27;s brother, Dave Nutting, also worked in the video game industry. He formed Dave Nutting Associates, a consulting firm that produced many of Midway&#x27;s games during the 1970s and early 80s.

<text>Ted Wong (November 5, 1937 – November 24, 2010) was a martial arts practitioner best known for studying under Bruce Lee.

==Early life==
Wong was born in Hong Kong in 1937. His father, a native Californian of Chinese descent, was stationed there while serving in the US Navy. His family moved back to San Francisco, California, in 1953, and a few years later to San Diego. After completing high school and college, Wong served in the US Army as a lieutenant for 2 years in West Germany. After serving, he returned to San Diego in 1962.

==Martial arts==

Wong&#x27;s first encounter with Bruce Lee was in 1967, in Los Angeles, California, where Lee was giving a Kung Fu seminar. Wong had no martial arts training, and was interested in western boxing and some martial arts. He was so impressed by Lee, however, that he decided to study at Lee&#x27;s kwoon, the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Los Angeles. Shortly after beginning his studies, Lee accepted Wong as a private student. Wong became Lee&#x27;s sparring partner and close friend.

Wong was present as Lee developed Jun Fan Gung Fu into Jeet Kune Do. He was present to see Lee train other martial artists, including Karate Champion Joe Lewis and basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Wong was one of only a few people to receive rank in the art of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee. Wong never learned another martial art besides what Lee had taught him, thus he never taught anything other than what he learned.

Wong gave seminars and continued to teach privately until his death. He co-authored several books about Jeet Kune Do. Some of his students included Bruce Lee’s daughter Shannon Lee. Wong was a lifetime board member of the Bruce Lee Foundation and the Jeet Kune Do Society.

Ted Wong had a core group of long-time students whom he certified as instructors, such as Lewis Luk, Albert Grajales, Bill Mattucci, Richard Torres, Mike Gittleson, and others around the world. In the Netherlands, James ter Beek and George Sirag. In Spain, Joaquin Marcelo. In Italy, Alberto Costanzo and Davide Gardella. These instructors are continuing to practice the JKD as taught by Ted Wong and Bruce Lee at their own locations.

Ted Wong was inducted into Black Belt magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame as the &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in 2006.

<doc id="963914" wikidata="Q1953641" url="?curid=963914" title="Braun's lipoprotein">
<text>Braun&#x27;s lipoprotein (BLP, Lpp, murein lipoprotein, or major outer membrane lipoprotein) was first identified by V. Braun and K. Rehn in 1969, it was the first Lipoprotein identified prompting much further study in this area. It is found in some gram-negative cell walls, is one of the most abundant membrane proteins; its molecular weight is about 7.2 kDa. It is bound at its C-terminal end (a lysine) by a covalent bond to the peptidoglycan layer (specifically to diaminopimelic acid molecules) and is embedded in the outer membrane by its hydrophobic head (a cysteine with lipids attached). BLP tightly links the two layers and provides structural integrity to the outer membrane.

==Characteristics==
The gene encoding Braun&#x27;s lipoprotein initially produces a protein composed of 78 amino acids, which includes a 20 amino acid signal peptide at the amino terminus. The mature protein is 6 kDa in size. Three monomers of Lpp assemble into a leucine zipper coiled-coil trimer.

Large amounts of Braun&#x27;s lipoprotein is present, more than any other protein in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Unlike other lipoproteins, it is linked covalently to the peptidoglycan. Lpp connects the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan. Lpp is anchored to the outer membrane by its amino-terminal lipid group. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, one third of Lpp proteins form a peptide bond via the side chain of its carboxy-terminal lysine with diaminopimelic acid in the peptidoglycan layer. The rest of the Lpp molecules are present in a &quot;free&quot; form unlinked to peptidoglycan. The free form is exposed on the surface of &quot;E. coli&quot;.

==Functions==
Lpp, along with another OmpA-like lipoprotein called Pal/OprL (), maintains the stability of the cell envelope by attaching the outer membrane to the cell wall.

Lpp has been proposed as a virulence factor of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, the cause of plague. &quot;Y. pestis&quot; needs &quot;lpp&quot; for maximum survival in macrophages and to efficiently kill mouse models of bubonic and pneumonic plague.

==Immunology==
Braun&#x27;s lipoprotein binds to the pattern recognition receptor TLR2. Lpp induces adhesion of neutrophils to human endothelial cells by activating the latter.

<text>White Hart Lane was a football stadium in Tottenham, North London and the home of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club from 1899 to 2017. Its capacity varied over the years; when changed to all-seater it had a capacity of 36,284. The stadium was fully demolished after the end of the 2016–17 season.

The stadium hosted 2,533 competitive Spurs games in its 118-year history. It was also used for England national football matches and England under-21 football matches. White Hart Lane once had a capacity of nearly 80,000 with attendances in the early 1950s that reached the 70,000s, but as seating was introduced, the stadium&#x27;s capacity decreased to a modest number in comparison to other Premier League clubs. The record attendance at the ground was 75,038, for an FA Cup tie on 5 March 1938 against Sunderland. Tottenham&#x27;s final game at White Hart Lane was played on 14 May 2017 with a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.

Tottenham&#x27;s new home, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, has a capacity of 62,062 and was designed by Populous. It was built in almost the same location as White Hart Lane, instead of moving elsewhere within or away from the borough of Haringey. While the replacement stadium was under construction, all Tottenham home games in the 2017–18 season as well as all but five in 2018–19 were played at Wembley Stadium. After two successful test events, Tottenham Hotspur officially moved into the new ground on 3 April 2019.

==History==
===Origin===
When the club was first formed in 1882, the club played its matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes. As the ground was on public land, the club could not charge admission fees for spectators, and while the number of spectators grew to a few thousands within a few years, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch between numbers 69 and 75 Northumberland Park at a cost of £17 per annum, with the spectators charged 3d a game. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built on the ground for the 1894–95 season. Overcrowding at the ground however became an issue; in 1898, during a match against Woolwich Arsenal attended by a record crowd of 15,000, the refreshment stand collapsed when fans climbed up onto its roof, prompting the club to start looking for a new ground. In 1899, the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the White Hart pub.

The new location was to the east of Tottenham High Road. The site was formerly used as a nursery owned by the brewery company Charringtons. The ground was leased from Charringtons with the proviso that Spurs must guarantee crowds of 1,000 for first-team matches and 500 for the reserves, easily achievable when the average attendance of Tottenham&#x27;s matches was 4,000. A groundsman at a local cricket club, John Over, was tasked with demolishing the greenhouses and preparing a playing surface for football. The stands from the previous ground at Northumberland Park were moved to the new ground. The new ground was never officially named, although names such as Gilpin Park and Percy Park were suggested. In its early days it was normally referred to as the Hotspur&#x27;s or Spurs&#x27; Ground by the club or the High Road Ground by the public, in time it became popularly known as White Hart Lane, which is in fact the name of the street on the western side of High Road, away from the ground. It is however unclear how it became so-named; some thought that it acquired the name because spectators would first meet up at the White Hart Lane railway station, another suggestion is that it referred to the lane leading to the stadium entrance beside the White Hart pub later officially named Bill Nicholson Way.
The first game at the Lane to mark its opening was a friendly against Notts County on 4 September 1899, with around 5,000 supporters attending, generating a gate receipt of £115. The first goal at the Lane came from Tommy McCairns of Notts County, followed by an equaliser from Tom Pratt and a hat-trick from David Copeland, ending in a 4–1 home win. The first competitive game on the ground was held five days later in front of an 11,000 crowd against Queens Park Rangers, which Spurs won 1–0 with the only goal scored by Tom Smith.

By 1904, the ground had an overall capacity of 32,000, with a main stand that provided seating for 500, and covered accommodation for 12,000. In February 1904, overcrowding during an FA Cup match against Aston Villa led to the abandonment of the match and a pitch invasion by fans, resulting in the club being fined and ordered to erect a steel fence around the pitch. The ground needed to be expanded; although a large earth bank was built at the Park Lane end in 1904, the club&#x27;s ability to develop the White Hart Lane site was restricted by the terms of the ground lease with Charringtons. Following a share issue, the club bought the freehold for £8,900 in 1905. An additional £2,600 was used to purchase the land at the northern (Paxton Road) end, where another large bank was built the same year to match the one at the Park Lane end, bringing the capacity up to 40,000. Spurs were admitted to the Second Division of the Football League in 1908, and they played their first league game on 1 September 1908 against Wolverhampton Wanderers at White Hart Lane. Spurs won 3–0, and the first Football League goal at the ground was scored by Vivian Woodward.

===Redevelopment===

White Hart Lane was redeveloped in the early 20th century, and its stands were rebuilt over a period of two and a half decades based on designs by the stadium architect Archibald Leitch. The first to be designed, the main West Stand, was a two-tiered structure with seating for 5,300 in the upper tier and a paddock in front with standing room for over 6,000. The roof covered the whole stand and featured a mock-Tudor gable, emblazoned with the club&#x27;s name. At the time of its construction, it was the largest stand at a British football ground. Built at a cost of £50,000, the West Stand opened on 11 September 1909 for Spurs&#x27; first home game in Division One, which was a match against Manchester United that ended in a 2–2 draw. The central section of the East Stand was also covered in 1909; two years later its wooden terrace was replaced by an enlarged concrete terrace, with the roof extended to cover the whole stand. With further expansion of the banking at the two ends, the stadium capacity increased to over 50,000 by the onset of the First World War. During the war, the stadium was taken over by the Ministry of War and the East Stand was turned into a factory for making gas masks, gunnery and protection equipment.
The pitch was overlooked by a bronze fighting cock (the club symbol) that kept an eye on proceedings from the roof of the touchline stands. The cockerel was adopted as an emblem for the club as Harry Hotspur, after whom the club was named, wore spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles, and spurs are also associated with fighting cocks. The original cockerel on a ball was erected in 1909 and was cast by William James Scott, who had played for the club when it was an amateur club. It was originally located atop the West Stand but was removed in 1957 for upgrading of floodlighting and reappeared on top of the East Stand in December 1958. In 1989, the original cockerel was removed to be replaced by fibreglass replicas that were placed on top of both the East Stand and West Stand. The original cockerel was moved to the executive suites where it stayed for many years, then to the West Stand reception. It was moved to the club offices at Lilywhite House in 2016 as the stadium was due to be demolished for redevelopment.

The ground continued to be renovated in the 1920s and early 1930s, with three more stands designed by Archibald Leitch. The FA Cup win in 1921 provided money to build a covered, two-tiered terrace at the Paxton Road end and, in 1923, a similar stand was added at the Park Lane end. The capacity had now reached 58,000, with about 40,000 under cover. In 1934 the club spent £60,000 to rebuild the East Stand. The new stand was a double-decker structure, with the lower section in two tiers; the upper section had 4,983 seats, while the two lower tiers provided standing room for over 18,700. The middle section, which is the top tier of the lower section, was known to fans as &quot;The Shelf&quot;. The Shelf became a place where ardent fans congregated, unlike many other stadiums where the stands behind the goals are the preferred gathering place for the loudest fans. It was also the only raised terracing in the English league. The total stadium capacity was now nearly 80,000. The East Stand was officially opened on 22 September 1934 for a match against Aston Villa.

In the 1930s, football had a popular following, and despite Tottenham&#x27;s relative lack of success at the time, 75,038 spectators squeezed into White Hart Lane in March 1938 to see Spurs&#x27; performance against Sunderland in the FA Cup. The redeveloped stadium was also used for international matches; in 1935 it hosted a game between Nazi Germany and England that England won, 3–0. The venue also hosted some of the football preliminaries for the 1948 Summer Olympics. During the Second World War, Spurs shared the ground with rival Arsenal when Highbury was requisitioned by the government and used as an Air Raid Precautions centre.

Tottenham became firmly established as one of England&#x27;s biggest clubs that attracted some of the highest attendances in the country on a regular basis. Attendance at White Hart Lane averaged at over 53,000 in 1961, their double winning year. Between the late 1920s and 1972, White Hart Lane was one of very few British football grounds that featured no advertising hoardings at all.

1953 saw the introduction of floodlights, with their first use being a friendly against Racing Club de Paris in September that year. They were upgraded in 1957, and in 1961, floodlight pylons were installed. These were renovated again in the 1970s, and in 1990 the floodlight pylons were replaced with spotlights mounted on the East and West stands.

===All-seater stadium===
The stadium as designed by Archibald Leitch stayed in the same form for a few decades, seating sections however were progressively introduced. In 1962, 2,600 seats were fitted at the back of the South Stand (on Park Lane), followed the next year by 3,500 seats at the North (Paxton Road) Stand, which was further extended in 1968 to link up with the West Stand to give a further 1,400 seats. The South and West stands were linked in 1973, adding further seats, but the capacity of the ground dropped overall as seats replaced standing terraces.

In 1980, in a bid to improve facilities and upgrade what was then considered an outdated stadium, a new phase of redevelopment began that transformed the ground. The new chairman, Arthur Richardson, green-lit the project over the scepticism of previous chairman Sidney Wale. The old West Stand was demolished in November 1980 to be replaced by a new stand designed by Ernest Atherden that had 6,500 seats and featured 72 executive boxes. The new West Stand opened 15 months later on 6 February 1982 for a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, won by Spurs 6–1, with a hat-trick from Ricky Villa. However, cost overruns in the project, which rose from £3.5 million to £6 million, and the cost of rebuilding the team, resulted in financial difficulties for the club. Irving Scholar took advantage of a rift in the boardroom and bought out the shares of Wale, leading to a change of directors.
In 1985, a plan to demolish and rebuild the East Stand was rejected by Haringey Council. In 1988, the club decided to proceed instead with a refurbishment of the East Stand despite objections by fans. The long stretch of raised standing terrace on the East Stand, known by fans as The Shelf, was redesigned to include the installation of executive boxes replacing the upper section of the standing terrace. Work on the East Stand however caused the opening game of the 1988–89 season against Coventry to be postponed a few hours before kickoff. The East Stand was closed that season. Work on the stadium continued in the summer of 1989 and the refurbished East Stand opened on 18 October 1989 for the North London Derby. The cost of the project however, doubled to over £8 million; this, together with other financial problems, would again lead to a change of directors at the club in 1991.
There was perimeter fencing in the 1980s between the stands behind the goals and the pitch; high fencing in British football stadiums was erected to segregate away fans and to combat the threat of pitch invasions from hooligans in the 1970s. Fencing began to be removed in the later part of the 1980s, and all the fences were removed on 18 April 1989 for safety reasons in reaction to the Hillsborough disaster three days earlier, in which 97 Liverpool fans were fatally injured, most of them crushed to death against the perimeter fencing in an overcrowded standing area. The fencing at the same place had also previously caused an incidence of crushing of Spurs fans during a cup tie in 1981.
Also as a response to the Hillsborough disaster, and the subsequent Taylor Report of 1990 that called for all-seater stadiums, standing areas were removed over the next few years, further reducing the capacity of the ground. Standing areas on the lower terraces of the East and South stands were replaced with seating in 1992, followed by the North Stand the next year. The South Stand was demolished in 1994, and its redevelopment completed in March 1995. The work was partly funded by the Football Trust. The first Jumbotron video screen for live coverage and screening of away matches was also installed above the South Stand, and there would eventually be two screens, one above each penalty area. The renovation, and the addition of a second tier to the Members&#x27; (North) Stand on Paxton Road, was completed in 1998, leaving the stadium with a capacity of 36,240. The stadium would stay in this form, bar some minor adjustments, until 2016, when the north-east corner of the stadium was demolished to allow for the construction of a new stadium, while the final 2016–17 season was being played at White Hart Lane.

===Redevelopment and demolition===
By the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had fallen significantly behind compared to other major Premier League clubs who had plans to expand further (for example, proposed development of Old Trafford had a projected capacity of 79,000 while Arsenal planned to build a new stadium that would seat 60,000). Talks began over the redevelopment and future of White Hart Lane, and many stadium designs and ideas were mooted, including the possibility of Tottenham Hotspur moving home. However, a move to Wembley Stadium was ruled out by the club, as was talk of moving to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford after completion of the 2012 Olympic Games. Ultimately the club&#x27;s owners, ENIC Group, decided to focus solely on the ongoing redevelopment plan for White Hart Lane as part of the Northumberland Development Project.

Sections of the North and East Stands at the north-east corner were removed in 2016 to allow construction of the new stadium next to the old stadium in the final season at the Lane. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game of the 2016–17 competition at Wembley Stadium. On 14 May 2017, White Hart Lane hosted its final match in a Premier League encounter between Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. It ended in a 2–1 victory for the home side, securing the highest league ranking for Spurs since 1963, with goals from Victor Wanyama and Harry Kane. The last goal at the stadium was scored by Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. Demolition work on the stadium began the following day and was completed by August 2017.
==Other uses==
The stadium hosted many international football matches. One notable match took place in 1935 when England played Nazi Germany, which led to protests by Jewish groups. The match ended in a 3–0 win for England. During the construction of the new Wembley Stadium, White Hart Lane hosted full England international matches, such as a 2–0 defeat to Holland. Following the opening of the rebuilt Wembley, the Lane was occasionally used to host England Under-21s international matches, most notably a 1–1 draw against France Under-21s.

The ground was used for other sports and events since the early years such as baseball (there was once a Spurs baseball team). It was used for many boxing matches over many years, the earliest matches being held in 1922. There were a number of notable boxing matches at the stadium; for example, the match between Jack London vs Bruce Woodcock in 1945, the Frank Bruno vs Joe Bugner bout in 1987, and the fight on 21 September 1991 where Michael Watson collapsed with a near fatal brain injury after a bout with Chris Eubank.

In 1995 and 1996 White Hart Lane also hosted American football, as the home ground of the London Monarchs. Because the pitch could not accommodate a regulation-length American football field, the Monarchs received special permission from the World League to play on a 93-yard field. The new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium continued this association with American football as an artificial turf field is located beneath its retractable grass pitch, to be used for the American gridiron code of football.

==Structure and facilities==
The outer White Hart Lane frame was designed in a rectangular shape, with the inner seating tiers being rounded to maximise the number of seats possible within the structure. The cockerel was placed upon the West Stand, with the West Stand located on Tottenham High Road, the East Stand being on Worcester Avenue, the North Stand on Paxton Road and the South Stand on Park Lane. The stands were officially named after compass points, but were more colloquially referred to by the road onto which they back.

The capacity of the stands before the demolition of part of White Hart Lane, in summer 2016, was as follows:
The pitch at White Hart Lane, at 100 × 67 metres (or 6,700 square meters), was one of the smallest in the Premier League.

==Records==
Tottenham&#x27;s biggest ever win came at the stadium in an FA Cup tie against Crewe in February 1960, with a 13–2 final score. This was also the highest score seen at the stadium. The biggest win in the Football League at the stadium took place on 22 October 1977 against Bristol Rovers, which finished 9–0. On 22 November 2009, Tottenham defeated Wigan Athletic 9–1 in the Premier League. The club&#x27;s biggest defeats at the venue were 0–6 scores in Division One, firstly against Sunderland on 19 December 1914 and later against Arsenal on 6 March 1935.

The player with the most appearances at White Hart Lane is Steve Perryman who played 436 games, while Jimmy Greaves scored the most goals, with 176 goals at The Lane. The highest attendance recorded at The Lane was 75,038 for the Sixth Round FA Cup tie against Sunderland, 5 March 1938. It was also the highest ever gate for a home match at the club until 2016 when over 85,000 attended the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League match against Monaco, held at Wembley Stadium, which was their temporary home for European matches that season.

==Transport==
The area close to the stadium is regularly served by many different bus routes and services. Bus routes 149, 259, 279, and 349 stop outside the ground. White Hart Lane and Northumberland Park National Rail stations are and away, respectively. Tottenham Hale, a rail and tube station, and Seven Sisters tube station are also nearby. There are controlled parking zones in operation in the area on all match days.

==Future with new stadium==
The first plan for relocation, reported in 2001, was to relocate to a proposed 43,000-seat stadium at Pickett&#x27;s Lock, intended for the 2005 World Athletics Championships to be held in London. However, the stadium was never built as the government deemed the project too expensive, and the games eventually took place in Helsinki.

Over the next few years various other schemes were suggested, including a relocation to the rebuilt Wembley Stadium (which finally opened in 2007). On 1 October 2010, ostensibly as a back-up to the plans for a new stadium, Tottenham registered interest in making use of the Olympic Stadium, being built for the 2012 London Olympics, in conjunction with AEG, owners and operators of The O2 in London&#x27;s Greenwich, formerly known as the Millennium Dome. The club also proposed rebuilding on the site after the 2012 Olympics. However, Spurs bid for the stadium was rejected on 11 February 2011. Spurs pursued legal action over the ruling to give the Stratford stadium to West Ham United, but later withdrew.

The club also pursued another option, namely the Northumberland Development Project (NDP). This involved a plan to build a new stadium, partly on the site of the existing White Hart Lane ground, and include leisure facilities, shops, housing, a club museum, a public space and also a new base for the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation. The NDP was announced on 30 October 2008 to develop the current site and land to its north, to construct a totally new 56,250-seat stadium. On 26 October 2009, the club submitted their planning application, hoping to start work on the new ground in 2010, and to be playing in it come 2012. But in May 2010, following adverse reaction, this was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application. Haringey Council were requested on 30 September 2010 to grant permission for the new stadium and other associated developments (subject to negotiation of &#x27;Section 106&#x27; developer contributions). The new plans were referred to English Heritage, the Mayor of London and the Secretary of State for a final decision. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, approved the plans on 25 November 2010. On 20 September 2011, planning permission was granted (planning reference HGY/2010/1000).
The development plans were revised several times during a lengthy delay because of a compulsory purchase order (CPO). This CPO was eventually issued in July 2014, giving approval for the new stadium scheme to proceed, but was subject to an unsuccessful legal challenge by a business located within the proposed site in February 2015. On 8 July 2015, Tottenham announced brand new revised plans, including a larger 61,000 capacity, making it the biggest club stadium in London. The revised stadium design also included a 17,000 seat single tier stand, the biggest of its kind in the UK. The new plan also included a combination of 585 new homes, a 180-room hotel, an extreme sports building, a community health centre, enhanced public spaces and &#x27;The Tottenham Experience&#x27; – an interactive museum and club shop complex incorporating the listed Warmington House. Additionally, on 8 July 2015 it was announced by the club that the new stadium would host two NFL International Series games, every year, for ten years.

On 16 December 2015, the revised plans were approved by Haringey Council (planning reference HGY/2015/3000) that would enable Phase 2 of the NDP to begin, as Phase 1 (Lilywhite House) had already been completed in February 2015. This therefore allowed widening of the High Road pavement leading to the new stadium by demolishing three buildings (Edmonton Dispensary, The Red House, and the former White Hart Public House). Construction work on the stadium began in early 2016.

On 28 April 2017, it was announced that Tottenham would play all its home matches in the 2017–18 season at Wembley Stadium, in order to complete the demolition of White Hart Lane and the construction of the new stadium. The new stadium was scheduled to open for the start of the 2018/19 season, but the opening was delayed until 2019. The White Hart Lane name would be abandoned in favour of a naming rights sponsorship link.

<text>Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. is an American fast food restaurant chain focused on a variety of tacos, burritos, French fries, and burgers. Del Taco is led by Brand President Tom Rose, and is headquartered in Lake Forest, California. On December 6, 2021, Jack in the Box announced it was acquiring Del Taco for $12.51 per share. The acquisition was finalized in March 2022. Del Taco has approximately 600 locations in 16 US states.
==History==

===1960s===
The first Del Taco restaurant was opened by Ed Hackbarth and David Jameson in Yermo, California, east of Barstow, on September 16, 1964, under the name &quot;Casa Del Taco&quot;. On the first day of business, Del Taco made $169 (the equivalent of $ in ). Success of the first restaurant led to two in Barstow, one in Needles, and a fifth restaurant in Corona (the first Del Taco with a drive-through window). Dick Naugle, who installed the kitchen equipment in the Corona store, was impressed by the design and joined Hackbarth and Jameson in the fledgling business. In 1966, the trio founded Red-E-Food Systems, Inc., with the idea of franchising the Del Taco brand. That same year, the original Del Taco sun logo was created. In 1967, Del Taco introduced their bean and cheese burrito with green or red sauce.

===1970s===
Naugle left the company early in the decade to start Naugles. In 1973, the company dropped &quot;Casa&quot; from its name and Red-E-Food Systems became Del Taco, Inc. By that time, the company opened a new restaurant every month. In 1976, Hackbarth and Jameson sold Del Taco to a group of investors. The new owners sold the exclusive rights to use and develop the Del Taco name throughout the US (excluding California; Eugene, Oregon; and Yuma, Arizona) to W. R. Grace and Company. Grace, primarily a chemicals company, founded a new company, Del Taco Restaurants Inc. of Dallas, Texas, and a new subsidiary, DTG Inc., to oversee the fast food chains it was acquiring. The franchise continued to expand. In 1977, there were 50 Del Taco restaurants. In 1978, there were 100.

===1980s===
In 1981, Del Taco had approximately 350 restaurants (located almost exclusively in California).

In February 1989, Del Taco merged their restaurants with the 171 Naugles&#x27; Mexican fast food outlets. Anwar Soliman was instrumental in the move. He was the mastermind behind the purchase of the rights to expand Del Taco throughout the US in 1977. With the merger, Del Taco increased in size, and spread as far east as Hickory, North Carolina. In the 1980s, Del Taco began to stay open all night. In Lake Forest, California, there are two Del Tacos directly across the street from each other on Trabuco Road and El Toro Road. The one at the 22401 El Toro Road address was formerly a Naugles. In Orange, two Del Tacos are across the street from each other on Tustin Avenue. The one with the Lincoln Avenue address was formerly a Naugles.

===1990s===
In 1990, Kevin K. Moriarty joined Del Taco as CEO, soon becoming the owner of the brand in conjunction with his management team. His team launched efforts to grow the brand&#x27;s image while improving the total customer experience.

In 1992, Del Taco recaptured exclusive rights to its name from W. R. Grace and Company, and was able to expand outside of California. Del Taco launched a $14 million program to redesign its restaurant exteriors, kitchens and corporate logo. The company presented its Concept 2000 restaurant design, and in August 1992 introduced its new logo. In place of the orange and blue sunset, there was a yellow sun that rose over green mountains against a red background. These colors represented the primary ingredients of Del Taco food: cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. Later that year, executives announced plans to expand the chain to 500 stores by 1995, and to add another 225 by 2000. The first new markets it sought were Las Vegas, Nevada; St. Louis, Missouri; and the Northeast Corridor.

Del Taco filed for protection in 1993 under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Although renovations were made to keep Del Taco profitable, the company continued to pay rent on several unprofitable outlets that had been closed. They also attempted to negotiate lease reductions on other high-cost sites. Also, Del Taco had been sued for $3 million by a former supplier. This was settled out of court.

From 1994 through 1998, Del Taco shrank and then grew. Although the company signed a deal to open 15 franchise stores in the Northeast with many more in the Southeast, the chain was not near the goals publicized earlier. In 1995, Del Taco had 300 stores instead of growing to 500 stores. The chain began to prosper in 1997 when total sales reached an estimated $250 million. By December 1998, Del Taco had 325 stores in 12 states.

===2000s===
By 2000, Del Taco had 372 stores located in ten US states. That year a deal was signed with the Compass Group PLC that enabled Del Taco stores to open on US military bases. The first to do business was at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, in early 2001. Other Del Tacos were planned for US bases in Puerto Rico and Naples, Italy.

In early 2001, a group of former Del Taco employees, all of whom were black, brought a discrimination suit against the chain. The group claimed that while working at Del Taco in the Los Angeles area, they had suffered verbal abuse, had been passed over for promotions in favor of Hispanic workers, and were being fired and replaced by illegal immigrants. The case had not been settled.

In an effort to improve its reputation, Del Taco launched a sports-sponsorship program with teams in eight US states, including the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Arizona Coyotes hockey teams, basketball&#x27;s Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas&#x27;s football and basketball teams, and several minor league hockey and baseball teams. The deal placed the Del Taco logo on signs, drink cups and special promotional items at the stadia of partner teams. It paid off as, in 2003, Del Taco announced that their restaurants had topped $1 million per store in average annual sales, which was remarkable considering that other US stores, notably McDonald&#x27;s and Carl&#x27;s Jr., featured a decrease in annual sales.

In 2006, private Nashville, Tennessee-based Sagittarius Brands, LLC (the parent company of Captain D&#x27;s Seafood), purchased Del Taco.

In January 2008, Del Taco announced the opening of its 500th restaurant in Burbank, California. On April 27, 2009, a new Del Taco opened in Oviedo, Florida, marking the first time since the 1980s that Del Taco was available in the Orlando area. This location has since closed. There are two other Orlando locations still open.

===2010s===

Del Taco returned to Texas in November 2010 with a new location in Denton, Texas. W. R. Grace and Company had previously owned and operated locations in Texas with a licensing agreement in 1978, but sold the restaurants to Taco Bell in 1992. Guillermo Perales, one of the largest Hispanic restaurateurs in the nation, signed a franchisee agreement in 2011 to open additional locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas. 

In 2011, Del Taco opened four locations in Colorado in Denver and Colorado Springs; it grew to 21 stores across the state. In March 2012, a location opened in Houston with plans for further expansion in the Houston area (that location was defunct by May 2015), including both Harris County and Montgomery County. In December 2012, a Del Taco opened in Cedar Park, Texas. Another was opened in Round Rock, Texas, in 2013.

In April 2013, Del Taco entered Alabama by opening its first restaurant in Dothan, Alabama. A second restaurant opened in Montgomery, Alabama, in October 2013 only to close in February 2016. Del Taco entered Oklahoma in December 2013, opening its first store in Moore. In summer 2014, a store opened in Edmond, Oklahoma.

Del Taco was purchased by Levy Acquisition Corporation and became a public company on June 30, 2015.

===2020s===

In October 2020, Del Taco opened its first Ohio restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. Del Taco also opened a location in Guam.

In September 2021, Del Taco announced it was expand into Virginia. The first restaurant in Virginia was opened in July 2024 in Chesapeake.

In the same month, Del Taco released their new rewards program app, called &quot;Del Yeah! Rewards&quot;.

On December 6, 2021, Jack in the Box announced it was acquiring Del Taco, saying the merger will cause both companies to benefit &quot;from a stronger financial model, gaining greater scale to invest in digital and technology capabilities, and unit growth for both brands&quot;. The combined company will have more than 2,800 locations across 25 states. The acquisition closed in March 2022 for about $585 million. Jack in the Box previously owned mexican fast casual purveyor Qdoba, which it divested in 2018.

==Availability==
The chain operates in 17 US states, 1 US Territory (Guam), and had 594 locations as of May 1, 2023. The majority of their restaurants are in California. Del Taco also operates in several other states, including Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Washington. The company has a handful of locations east of the Mississippi. 

Las Vegas, Nevada, has the most Del Tacos of any single city, and California has the most Del Tacos of any state.

On February 27, 2025, all locations in Colorado were closed with no warning or explanation leaving many employees out of work and customers looking for information that the corporation refused to address.

On January 29, 2020, Del Taco launched a new dollar menu, with items costing a dollar or less before tax. On January 2, 2025, Del Taco expanded this menu by adding two new burritos: the Bean, Rice &amp; Cheese Burrito and the Chipotle Chicken Burrito, each priced under $3.

==Marketing==
The first mascot of Del Taco was a character of the same name used from 1999 through 2000. Del Taco was sued by Zorro Productions, Inc., and Tristar Pictures, Inc., who claimed that the &quot;Del Taco&quot; character – masked and costumed in black – infringed on their rights to the trademark Zorro figure. Del Taco settled the suit in January 2000, agreeing to make changes to the Del Taco character, and soon discontinued the ad campaign.

From 2000 through early 2006, Del Taco used Gregg Binkley to play &quot;Dan&quot; in commercials. A clumsy spokesman, Dan was known for antics during commercials. Dan destroyed cars, broke hockey-rink glass, and held a sales event at a nude beach, while promoting a specific item for Del Taco.

From August 2007 through July 2008, Del Taco featured &quot;The Beast&quot; in their commercials. &quot;The Beast&quot;, a personification of hunger, typically stood next to a customer and persuaded him to order a particular item (or items) so that they could &quot;Feed the Beast&quot; (Del Taco&#x27;s slogan). &quot;The Beast&quot; made his debut in August 2007 promoting Del Taco&#x27;s improved Chicken Soft Taco. He also endorsed the Crispy Fish Taco in February 2008, the improved Chicken Quesadilla in April 2008, and Del&#x27;s Deal in June 2008.

Del Taco has used a variety of commercials to promote the slogan, &quot;Go Bold or Go Home&quot;. The first commercial featured a team of miniature &quot;Mole Men&quot; to promote the Spicy Chicken Mole Soft Taco, which aired in August 2008. Ads included Del Taco&#x27;s promotion of their improved regular taco in September 2008, the Classic Combo Deal in November 2008, three separate meal deals for under three dollars in January 2009, the crispy shrimp taco in February 2009, the chicken soft taco in April 2009, and the chicken fajita burrito in June 2009.

On June 27, 2018, Del Taco launched a campaign celebrating employees&#x27; successes while working at their restaurants using the new slogan, &quot;Celebrating the hardest working hands in fast food,&quot; although the slogan, &quot;That&#x27;s unfreshing believable&quot;, is still used to promote their fresh food.

==Popular culture==
* On the Netflix show &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, Frankie, played by Lily Tomlin, regularly mentions her love of Del Taco throughout the series. Scenes include her revealing that she and her husband once bought a franchise and Frankie taking Grace for her first Del Taco visit.
* A popular Vine by Gasoleen TV features her reading a Del Taco sign that has incorrect spacing. The sign says: &quot;FR E SH A VOCA DO&quot; Del Taco has gone on to use this phrase on a Twitter marketing campaign.
* A popular YouTube channel, thecreaturehub, featured the Barstow location (the &quot;oldest operating location&quot;) on both their Road to E3 series from 2014-2015, in which the restaurant was one of the group&#x27;s stops on the trips.

== Controversies ==
In 2018, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a lawsuit against Del Taco, stating that the shift leader and general manager of stores near Rancho Cucamonga, California, harassed female employees through vulgar comments, physical conduct, and propositions of sex. The EEOC stated that the harassment occurred almost daily, and those who spoke up were retaliated against by having their work hours shortened or schedules changed. In December 2020, Del Taco settled the lawsuit by agreeing to pay $12.5 million and enter a three-year consent decree. The decree required Del Taco to train employees on anti-discrimination laws with an emphasis on sexual harassment, retain an employment monitor, and make it easier for employees to report harassment and discrimination.

In 2017, Del Taco was accused of violating state wage and hour laws, with the case including people who worked for the company between 2012 and 2021. In June 2022, Del Taco agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit in California for $50 million.

<text>The Maryland House of Delegates is the lower house of the legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland. It consists of 141 delegates elected from 47 districts. The House of Delegates Chamber is in the Maryland State House on State Circle in Annapolis. The State House also houses the Maryland State Senate and the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the State of Maryland. Each delegate has offices in Annapolis, in the nearby Casper R. Taylor Jr. House Office Building.

== History ==
===17th century ===
The Maryland House of Delegates originated as the Lower House of the General Assembly of the Province of Maryland in 1650, when it was an English colony, when the Assembly (legislature) became a bicameral body. The Lower House often fought with the Upper House for political influence in the colony. The Upper House consisted of the Governor and his Council, all personally appointed by Lord Baltimore and Proprietor of the Province, and thus tended to protect his interests in Maryland. Conversely, the Lower House tended to push for political change in the colony, claiming to be the true elected representatives of the people.

In this context, the Lower House continually fought for more power by asserting exclusive rights in certain legislative areas, such as levying taxes and originating money bills. This reflected similar attitudes in the other colonies on the East Coast of North America with the beginnings and growth of representative government during the 17th century, as each province&#x27;s representatives constantly agitated for more rights, powers, and respect from the Proprietors, Governors, and even the King and Parliament in London.

The Governor also had some measure of control over the Lower House in the late seventeenth century. Despite the fact that each county was entitled to elect four delegates, the governor selected only two of these to sit in the Lower House. This enabled the Governor to control the Lower House&#x27;s membership.

In 1689, the transfer of Maryland from a proprietary colony to a royal colony temporarily quieted the disputes between the Lower House and the Governor and Council. Appointed by the crown, the royal governors allowed the Lower House substantial latitude with its legislative agenda. The first General Assembly under Royal Authority, in 1692, passed 85 acts in a single session. The Lower House immediately acted to remove the Governor&#x27;s influence over the election of delegates. Now, elected delegates could attend the session without the need for a special writ from the Governor. At the same time, standing or continuing committees were established. These eliminated the Lower House&#x27;s reliance on ad hoc committees and created the first modern legislature in Maryland. During this period, the Lower House became known as the &quot;House of Delegates&quot;.

===18th century===
The Maryland Constitution of 1776 formally established the modern House of Delegates. Initially, representation was based on geography as the voters of each county elected four delegates, and two each were elected from the towns of Annapolis and Baltimore. These delegates served one-year terms (increased to two years in 1845, and four years in 1922, as it is today).

===19th century===
Beginning with the 1838 elections, each county elected at least three and up to six delegates depending on its population. Baltimore City elected the same number of delegates as did the most populous county, but after 1840, the Town of Annapolis was then considered part of Anne Arundel County. Reapportionment was required after every federal census in an attempt to achieve equal representation.

===Modern era===
The current pattern for distribution of seats in the House of Delegates began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter. The plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district sends three delegates for a total of 141 members of the House. Some of the larger districts are divided into delegate sub-districts to provide local representation to areas not large enough to constitute an entire legislative district. In a special session on May 1, 2019, Delegate Adrienne A. Jones became the first woman and the first African American to be elected Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates.

==Powers and functions==
The powers and functions of the Maryland House of Delegates are outlined in the Maryland Constitution. Along with the State Senate, the House has the power to approve laws, establish executive departments, levy taxes, and propose state constitutional amendments. Both houses also have the power to elect the state treasurer and to appoint a new Governor if the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor are simultaneously vacant. In addition, the House of Delegates has the sole power to impeach members of the executive branch, including the Governor. Once the House of Delegates has passed articles of impeachment, the person impeached stands trial before the State Senate.

==Organization==
The House of Delegates utilizes a number of different organizational structures. Much of the work of drafting and reviewing bills is done by six standing committees: Appropriations, Economic Matters, Environment and Transportation, Health and Government Operations, Judiciary, and Ways and Means. Each of these committees is then divided further into sub-committees by issue area. An additional continuing committee, Executive Nominations, has the responsibility for confirming appointments of the Governor. Delegates also divide themselves into a variety of legally recognized work groups, Joint and Special Committees, caucuses, and geographic delegations. The two largest caucuses are those of the Democratic and Republican Parties.

Smaller caucuses might group Delegates by identity, such as the Women&#x27;s Caucus, notably the first women&#x27;s legislative caucus founded in the United States. The Asian-American and Pacific Islander caucus, or Legislative Black Caucus are other examples. Delegates may also organize by issue or area of experience, such as the Veterans&#x27; Caucus. In addition, delegates from a certain county, smaller towns, or Baltimore City might organize its delegate delegation into a caucus-style group, such as the Baltimore City Delegation or the Western Maryland Delegation.

<doc id="963926" wikidata="Q3442925" url="?curid=963926" title="USS Hopkins (DD-6)">
<text>USS &quot;Hopkins&quot; (DD-6) was a &quot;Hopkins&quot;-class destroyer, which was a sub-class of the , in the United States Navy. She was the first of three Navy vessels named in honor of Commodore of the Continental Navy Esek Hopkins.

==Construction==
&quot;Hopkins&quot; was launched by Harlan &amp; Hollingsworth Company, Wilmington, Delaware, on 24 April 1902, and sponsored by Alice Gould Hawes, a great-great-granddaughter of Esek Hopkins. The ship was commissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 September 1903, with Lieutenant Montgomery M. Taylor in command.

==Pre-World War I==
&quot;Hopkins&quot; sailed from Philadelphia on 12 May 1904, and joined the Fleet at Norfolk. That summer the destroyer deployed with the Coast Squadron for the midshipmen at sea training. During the following three years she ranged into the Caribbean Sea, exercising with the Flotilla, engaging in torpedo practice, and Fleet problems. In September 1906, &quot;Hopkins&quot; was present for the Presidential Review off Oyster Bay. On 29 September, she and escorted the President in to Cape Cod Bay to witness record target practice. In 1907–1908, &quot;Hopkins&quot; – as part of the Torpedo Flotilla – accompanied the Atlantic Fleet on a practice cruise to the Pacific. They sailed from Hampton Roads on 2 December 1907, exchanging courtesies at various Mexican and South American ports &quot;en route&quot;. After target practice in Magdelena Bay, the Flotilla arrived at San Francisco on 6 May 1908, in time for the review of the combined Atlantic and Pacific Fleets by the Secretary of the Navy. On 1 June of that year, &quot;Hopkins&quot; joined the Pacific Torpedo Fleet for tactics along the West Coast, at sea training north to Alaskan waters, and south to the coast of Mexico.

On 14 February 1910, &quot;Hopkins&quot; suffered a boiler accident. Two sailors, Chief Watertender Robert Earl Bonney and Watertender Edward Alvin Clary, were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the incident.

==World War I==
On 30 April 1917, after the United States entry into World War I, &quot;Hopkins&quot; departed San Diego for the Panama Canal Zone. She performed patrol duty, convoyed submarines and assisted them in torpedo proving. On 3 August, she arrived at Hampton Roads, for escort and patrol ranging along the coast to Bermuda.

&quot;Hopkins&quot; entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 January 1919, and decommissioned there 20 June. She was sold for scrapping on 7 September 1920 to the Denton Shore Lumber Company.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==

<text>Gaby Kennard (born 1944, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) was the first Australian woman to circumnavigate the globe by airplane. When she was 18 she found out that her natural father was a fighter pilot in the United States Army Air Force during World War II. He was killed in an aircraft accident near Amberley air base, Ipswich on July 17, 1943, shortly after she was conceived.

She completed her commercial pilot&#x27;s licence in 1984 and her multi-engine instrument rating in 1987.

In 1989, she began her journey, following Amelia Earhart&#x27;s route as much as possible. The trip took 99 days and covered 29,000 nautical miles (54,000 km). In recognition of this achievement, she received the Harmon Trophy. The trip made Kennard a celebrity and she used this status to raise funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia.

She is married to Neville Kennard and has a daughter and son.

In 2008 Kennard was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia.

<text>Emil Schult (born 10 October 1946) is a German painter, poet and audio-visual artist.

==Biography==

After studying Sinology in Münster, Schult joined the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf in 1969 to study Fine Arts in the printmaking class of Dieter Roth, and later in the painting classes of Joseph Beuys and Gerhard Richter. In 1973, he finished his studies with the title of &#x27;Meisterschüler&#x27; of Gerhard Richter. Both Joseph Beuys and Dieter Roth, as well as Roth&#x27;s partner Dorothy Iannone, remained important for Schult&#x27;s artistic development. In 1969, Schult lived in Reykjavik at Roth&#x27;s studio-home.

Schult has developed a vast body of work beginning with prints, drawings and artist&#x27;s books that encompass philosophical writings, poems, comics, collages and drawings. Early on he included film in his repertoire as well as painting – later on he only worked with reverse glass painting.

From 1970 to 1974, Schult collaborated with the Free International University, founded by Joseph Beuys. From 1973 to 1975 he also worked as an art teacher at a grammar school in Düsseldorf, then as a lecturer at the former college of education in Münster. Schult published books on art didactics.

In 1972, Schult started an artistic collaboration with Kraftwerk founders Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. As artist friends they created the &quot;musicomix&quot; poster for the album &quot;Ralf and Florian&quot;, further artwork for &quot;Autobahn&quot; and &quot;Radioactivity&quot;, and additional graphics. During the subsequent years of their collaboration, they also wrote lyrics and sound poetry for the albums &quot;Autobahn&quot; and &quot;Radioactivity&quot;, as well as the single &quot;The Model&quot;, which was a number 1 hit in the UK, coupled with &quot;Computer Love&quot;, which Schult also co-wrote. In addition, he collaborated with the band on the writing of their 1981 singles &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; and &quot;Computer World&quot;.

In 1979, he deepened his studies of Computer Music at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Stanford University, CA, USA. Since the mid-1980s, Schult has also worked with video and computer-animated images.

In the late 1980s, he moved to the Bahamas, where he developed his distinctive style of reverse glass painting, which has informed his future work. This ancient Chinese technique opened to Schult a contemporary view on painting, as today the world is mostly perceived through glass – the window glass, the glass of the tablet, TV etc.

Since the early 1990s, he has lived in Düsseldorf, where he was commissioned to create a crypt for the Robert-Schumann Music Academy. The crypt is a complex artistic room intended to create an opportunity for student meditation. After submitting 50 photos of the crypt to Karlheinz Stockhausen, he composed a piece called &quot;50 Klangbilder&quot; for it. It was published in the form of a DVD in the publication &quot;Symbolik einer Krypta&quot; (Droste Verlag, 2012).

In Schult&#x27;s artistic work, topics such as the evolution of the electronic chip play a central role, as well as a series of homages to the pioneers of electronic developments. His focus lies on the visionary potential of art and his recent paintings reflect on the connection between humans, the electronic microcosmos and the vastness of space.

Schult has recently held solo exhibitions at Osthaus Museum Hagen, DE, Burchfield Penney Art Center, Buffalo, NY, USA, Rauschenberg Gallery at Florida South Western State College, Fort Myers, FL, USA, Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum, Paderborn, DE, Institute for Electronic Arts at Alfred University, NY, USA, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA.

He served as a guest professor at the Institute for Electronic Arts, Alfred University, New York, USA.

His recent participations in group exhibitions include Deichtorhallen Hamburg, DE, Haus der Kulturen der Welt Berlin, DE, Galerie Buchholz New York, USA, AC Gallery Beijing, CHN, Zhang Zhou International Contemporary Art Exhibition, CHN, Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, DE, Raketenstation Hombroich, Neuss, DE, Tampa Museum of Art, FL, USA, Julia Stoschek Foundation, Düsseldorf, DE, et al.

Since 2017, Schult has collaborated with Emma Nilsson as TRANSHUMAN ART CRITICS. In 2019, Lothar Manteuffel and Max Dax joined the group. TRANSHUMAN ART CRITICS view the evolution of electronic music and art from the perception of enhanced humans. The observations are presented as audio-visual pieces in which the archeological findings merge with the cognition of future.

<doc id="963960" wikidata="Q594855" url="?curid=963960" title="Sunn O)))">
<text>Sunn O))) (pronounced &quot;sun&quot;) is an American drone metal band formed in 1998 in Seattle, Washington. The band is known for its distinctive visual style and slow, heavy sound, which blends diverse genres including doom metal, drone, black metal, dark ambient, and noise rock, as well as for their extremely loud live performances. 

The band&#x27;s core members are Stephen O&#x27;Malley (also of Khanate and Burning Witch) and Greg Anderson (of Goatsnake and Engine Kid).

==History==
Sunn O))) is named after the Sunn amplifier brand, the logo of which includes a circle next to the &quot;sunn&quot; banner with waves heading off to the right. In interviews, Stephen O&#x27;Malley stated that the band&#x27;s name was also chosen as a play on the name Earth, a band widely regarded as pioneers of drone metal throughout the 1990s. Before the band members moved to Los Angeles, they briefly used the name Mars.

The band&#x27;s style is characterized by slow tempos, distorted guitars, lack of rhythm and melody, and alternative tunings. The guitars are notable for their low register, frequently utilizing tunings as low as dropped A. Additionally, the band is known for using resonant feedback to create monolithic soundscapes and eerie atmospheres. Percussion is rarely incorporated, with a lack of any discernible beat. When performing live, the band wears robes, fills the air with fog, and plays at a high volume.

The band releases the majority of its music through the label it founded in 1998, Southern Lord Records. However, the band initially released &quot;ØØ Void&quot; (its second album) on multiple labels, including Rise Above Records, Hydra Head Records, and Dirter Productions (which pressed it as a double album on vinyl). Additionally, the original pressing of &quot;The Grimmrobe Demos&quot; was released by Hydra Head Records. It was later issued as a double picture record set by Outlaw Recordings and finally reissued by Southern Lord in 2004.

In 2008, Sunn O))) released a live album titled &quot;Dømkirke&quot; and also announced a mini-tour consisting of four concerts to commemorate the group&#x27;s 10th anniversary, which coincided with the release of &quot;The Grimmrobe Demos&quot;.

On December 17, 2009, the song &quot;Hunting &amp; Gathering (Cydonia)&quot; from the CD &quot;Monoliths &amp; Dimensions&quot; was named the Heaviest Song of All-Time by Jason Ellis on &quot;The Jason Ellis Show&quot; on Sirius/XM. Greg Anderson then appeared on &quot;The Jason Ellis Show&quot; on January 12, 2010. Hungarian-born Attila Csihar (Mayhem) has performed live with the band as their primary vocalist since 2003.

Sunn O))) released a collaboration album with Ulver titled &quot;Terrestrials&quot; in February 2014: in October 2014, the band released the album &quot;Soused&quot;, a collaboration with singer-songwriter Scott Walker. In November 2015, Sunn O))) presented a four-day program at Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht, the Netherlands, including Annette Peacock, Magma, Julia Holter and The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and Sunn O))) itself.

The band worked with producer Steve Albini on two albums, &quot;Life Metal&quot; and &quot;Pyroclasts.&quot;

==Musical style==
Sunn O)))&#x27;s musical style has been described as drone metal, doom metal, experimental metal black metal, noise rock, and dark ambient. Sunn O))) experiments with a variety of styles and sounds, progressing beyond the primarily guitar and bass style of &quot;The Grimmrobe Demos&quot; and &quot;ØØ Void&quot;. On &quot;White1&quot; and &quot;White2&quot;, the band noticeably expanded on conceptualization by inviting several guests, resulting in everything from quiet meditative ambient sounds (&quot;A Shaving of the Horn that Speared You&quot; from &quot;White1&quot;) to a bizarre bass experiment track (&quot;bassAliens&quot; from &quot;White2&quot;). &quot;Black One&quot; continued in this direction, utilizing far more electronics, synthesizers, and other instrumentation than earlier Sunn O))) material, yet still marking a significant return to its traditional sound.

Sunn O))) is widely regarded as leaders in the genre, including by &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; of May 28, 2006, when the band was written up in an article called &quot;Heady Metal&quot; by John Wray. Sunn O))) also appeared in the August 2007 issue of &quot;Q&quot; magazine (the &quot;loud issue&quot;), with its album &quot;White1&quot; being named the 18th-loudest album of all time, just above AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot; and below Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;

<text>The Israeli Combat Engineering Corps (, &quot;Heil HaHandasa HaKravit&quot;) is part of the Israel Defense Forces with responsibility for mobility assurance, road breaching, defense and fortifications, counter-mobility of enemy forces, construction and destruction under fire, sabotage, explosives, bomb disposal, counter-weapons of mass destruction (NBC) and special engineering missions.

The Combat Engineering Corps beret&#x27;s color is silver and its symbol features a sword on a defensive tower with an explosion halo on the background. The Combat Engineering Corps mottos are &quot;&quot;Always First&quot; (ראשונים תמיד Rishonim Tamid)&quot; and the unofficial &quot;The hard, we shall do today; the impossible, we shall do tomorrow&quot;.

In addition to Combat Engineering Corps sappers, each infantry brigade has an engineering company trained with basic engineering and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) skills (called פלח&quot;הן). Combat Engineering Corps sappers and heavy equipment operators are often attached to other units (such as armored or infantry brigades) in order to help them breach through obstacles and handle explosive threats.

== Roles ==
Beside extensive training in basic combat engineering, combat engineers receive specialized training in their respective professions. These are:
* Sapper: trained with all the basic engineering skills and also trained at high infantry level (רובאי 07). Their main role is to breach through terrain obstacles (natural and artificial), breach through minefields and enable ground forces to advance in the battlefield. They are trained to supply close combat support for both armored fighting vehicles and infantry. Some of them are trained in driving the Combat Engineering Corps standard CEV: the IDF Puma. Their professional ranks after advanced training are Rifleman 07 (רובאי 07) and Sapper 06 (פלס 06).

* Engineering Vehicles Operator (EVO): less combatant but nonetheless important, these soldiers are skilled in the operation of heavy mechanical equipment and engineering vehicles such as heavy bulldozers, excavators, cranes, tractors and mine-breaching devices. EVO units are called צמ&quot;ה (&quot;Tzama&quot;) in Hebrew, acronym of &quot;Tziyud Mechani Handasi&quot; (Mechanical Engineering Equipment). Their professional ranks are Rifleman 05 (רובאי 05) and EVO Operator 07 (מפעיל צמ&quot;ה 07).
** Bulldozer Operators: belong to the EVO, these soldiers operate the IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers, including under heavy fire. Their roles are versatile and differ according to the units to which they are attached. The D9 operators perform construction, destruction, breaching and EOD missions while assisting tanks, infantry and even special forces during battle.
* NBC Disposal: called &quot;purifiers&quot;, they are expert in handling nuclear, biological and chemical threats.
* EOD experts: the EOD are experts in nondestructive detonation of explosives and bomb disposal. Among their equipment are the Barrett M82A1 and remote-control EOD robots with shotguns and mechanical arms. The EOD are the military equivalent of the police&#x27;s bomb squad. In the IDF, they are a part of the elite Engineering unit Yahalom.
* Demolition experts: they are specially trained in blowing up targets in the most accurate and effective way. They explode targets ranging from cellular phones and doorlocks up to tanks and large buildings. In the IDF, the demolition experts are united in Sayeret Yael of Yahalom (Sayeret is the Hebrew term for a SF elite unit) and therefore gain high infantry training as well.
* Fortification experts: assigned to designing and overseeing the construction of bases, outposts, bridges and fortifications. Construction itself is usually done by the EVOs.
* Counter-Tunnels experts: established in 2003 by the late Captain Aviv Hakani, these Combat Engineering Corps soldiers are experts in finding smuggling tunnels and weapon caches, and demolishing them. They operated in Rafah during the al-Aqsa Intifada and received recommendation of honor for their activity. After the 2004 APC incident the Rafah tunnel team was united with the Combat Engineering Corps elite unit Yahalom and was renamed Sayeret Samur (&quot;Samur&quot; means &quot;Weasel&quot; in Hebrew).

== Equipment ==

=== Personal gear ===
The Israeli combat engineers and sappers are combat soldiers and therefore have a personal gear and weapons as infantry soldiers. Their issued rifle is the M-16A1 (short 13/14-inch barrel) and M4 Carbine. Other weapons include hand grenades, M203 grenade launcher, IMI Negev, FN MAG and M2 Browning machineguns and M24 SWS and Barret M82A1 sniper rifles.

=== Vehicles ===
The combat engineering soldiers are mobilized by APCs and armored 4×4 vehicles.
The Armoured personnel carriers include the Centurion tank-based IDF Puma, a heavy combat engineering vehicle equipped with engineering devices such as mine plows. Reserve forces use the old and versatile M113 APC. In 2016 the 603rd Combat Engineering Battalion (&quot;Lahav&quot;) started to receive IDF Namer Combat engineering vehicle based on the Namer APC.

Wheeled armored vehicles include the HMMWV (&quot;Hummer&quot;), Wolf Armoured Vehicle and M240 Sufa.

=== Heavy equipment ===
The Combat Engineering Corps operates heavy equipment and engineering vehicles (called TZAMA in Hebrew) such as armored bulldozers, armored excavators, armored wheeled loaders, armored backhoe loaders and more. The best known tool is the heavily armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozer.

=== Mine breaching devices ===
The Combat Engineering Corps has different means to breach fast through mine fields. These include personal sapper gear, vehicle-mounted mine plows and mine rollers which can be attached to engineering vehicles and tanks, CARPET air-fuel rockets and the &quot;Tzefa Shiryon&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;Armor&#x27;s Viper&quot;) which is extremely powerful and can clear large mine fields.

=== Explosives ===
The Combat Engineering Corps has a wide range of explosives, demolition charges and different land mines.

=== Robots ===
Yahalom SF Unit operates many types of robots, including bomb disposal robots, reconnaissance robots and remote-controlled heavy equipment (such as &quot;Raam HaShachar&quot; D9N bulldozer, and the &quot;Front-Runner&quot; mini-cat loader).

=== NBC ===
Counter-NBC soldiers are equipped with protective suits and gas masks, chemical ID systems and purification vehicles.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The Combat Engineering Corps has a record of professional achievement and decoration. Its best known operation is the bridging of the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War.
The corps was formed from the sabotage unit of the Palmach and the tractor operators units of the 1947–1949 Palestine war. In its early years, the Combat Engineering Corps drew its soldiers mainly from Jews who had served in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Engineers.

ICEC chief engineer, Brigadier General David Leskov (not to be confused with Chief Engineering Officer קצין הנדסה ראשי, the commander of the ICEC), developed many combat engineering systems for the Israel Defense Forces, and won three Israel Security Prizes. He served in the IDF until his death at the age of 86, thus being the oldest soldier in the world.

=== In Israel&#x27;s wars ===
In the 1947–1949 Palestine war, the Combat Engineering Corps blasted bridges over the Jordan River and the streams of the southern Coastal plain in order to stop the advance of the Arab armored forces into the Israeli civilian rear. The Combat Engineering Corps also helped in breaching the &quot;Burma Road&quot; into besieged Jerusalem.

In the 1956 Sinai war, the Combat Engineering Corps destroyed Egyptian military infrastructure in the Sinai Peninsula and was awarded with a battalion recommendation of honor.

In the 1967 Six-Day War the Combat Engineering Corps stormed Jordanian fortifications along the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. After Israel annexed the Old City, the Combat Engineering Corps removed landmines planted in the city by the Jordanians. This was the first war in which Caterpillar D9 bulldozers were employed by the corps.

After the war, the Combat Engineering Corps helped to build a fortification line of defense along the Suez Canal and were awarded the Israel Security Prize in 1969. The Israeli Engineering Corps were the first corps to win the award.

In the 1973 Yom Kippur War the combat engineering battalions attached to Ariel Sharon&#x27;s armored division bridged the Suez Canal during &quot;Operation Knights of Heart&quot;, while carrying tanks and paratroopers across the canal with Gillois amphibious tank-carriers. This effort enabled Sharon and Avraham &quot;Bren&quot; Adan&#x27;s armored divisions to cross the canal and surround the 3rd Egyptian Army, forcing it to surrender. The bridging of the canal is regarded by many as the turning point of the war on the southern front. On the northern front, a Combat Engineering Corps Caterpillar D9 bulldozer was the first ever motorized vehicle to reach the summit of the Hermon.

In Operation Peace for Galilee the Combat Engineering Corps worked intensively to open routes for Israeli forces. Their duties also included the disarming landmines and Improvised explosive devices as well as building fortifications and outposts.

In the 1991 Gulf War, the NBC purifiers of the Combat Engineering Corps were on a &quot;code red&quot; alert for disarming Iraqi Scud missiles, armed with non-conventional warheads.

=== The October 2000 Lebanon abduction ===

On 7 October 2000 three Israeli combat engineering soldiers were abducted by Hezbollah from the Shebaa Farms, in the Golan Heights. The soldiers, Beni Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Sawaed, suffered fatal injuries during their abduction. Their bodies were retrieved in 2004 in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah.

A series of accusations were made against the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) by press and partisan web sites for having cooperated with the abduction. Those accusations stem from a video, whose existence was originally denied by UN officials, recorded by Indian peacekeepers one day after the abduction. The video, which the UN agreed to provide to Israeli officials in June 2001 with civilian faces blurred, showed abandoned vehicles with fake UN license plates and uniforms, and Hezbollah supporters intercepting UN efforts to retrieve the vehicles. A UN investigation found no evidence to support accusations of peacekeepers involvement in the abduction. Although the bereaved families met with Kofi Annan, they refused to accept the UN version. In September 2004, the bereaved families announced their intention to sue the UN, Hezbollah, Iran, Syria and Lebanon for their parts in the abduction.

=== The Second Intifada ===
&quot;For further discussions see: al-Aqsa Intifada, IDF Caterpillar D9, Operation Defensive Shield, Battle of Jenin 2002, Operation Rainbow.&quot;

During the al-Aqsa Intifada, which erupted in September 2000, the Combat Engineering Corps were employed to disarm many Palestinian IED explosive charges and booby traps. In many cases, the Combat Engineering EOD operators, together with Israeli Police bomb disposal operators, also detonated explosive belts captured on Palestinian suicide bombers. The Combat Engineering Corps also dynamited Palestinian houses, bomb labs and smuggling tunnels.

However, the Combat Engineering Corps were most known for operating the armored IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers. On the other side, for Palestinians, the bulldozers became a nightmare, as they bulldozed many Palestinian buildings and shrubbery, and were almost impervious to Palestinian attacks. The Combat Engineering Corps bulldozers&#x27; operators unit received a recommendation of honor for its activity in Jenin during Operation Defensive Shield.

Armored bulldozers were also massively employed in Rafah to counter terrorist smuggling tunnels. Human Rights Watch published a report criticizing the extensive destruction of Palestinian houses in the southern Gaza strip, and said it was unlawful, claiming that Israel uses the Palestinian smuggling tunnels as a pretext to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; along the Gaza-Egypt border. In Rafah, the Combat Engineering Corps formed a special unit, designated for searching and destroying smuggling tunnels, it is called SAMUR and now belongs to Yaalom. They also received an honor of recommendation, for their conduct. Until the Gaza Disengagement plan, the Combat Engineering 603 battalion&#x27;s reconnaissance platoon (מחס&quot;ר) held a record of over 70 terrorists killed in 2004–2005 on the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel. They received a recommendation of honor for this achievement.

=== Second Lebanon War ===
The Combat Engineering Corps took significant part in the Second Lebanon War that erupted in 2006 after Hizbullah attacked IDF patrol, abducted two soldiers and killed another 8 with anti-tank missiles and improvised explosive devices that hit the rescuers.

On 16 July combat engineering forces from Asaf battalion were the first to enter Lebanon. Their mission was to clear improvised explosive devices, open safe routes to ground forces and demolish Hizbullah infrastructures. Yahalom bomb disposal experts and IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozers cleared most of Hizbullah&#x27;s IEDs. During the war, a D9 went over a 500 kg belly charge improvised explosive devices but survived without taking significant damage.

During the war, combat engineers used bulldozers and explosives to destroy Hezbollah outposts, bunkers, warehouses and HQs—mainly along the border. The works intensified as the war reached near end, and indeed the borderline was cleared in time.

Combat engineers also rescued damaged tanks, often under fire.

Two combat engineers were awarded with Medal of Distinguished Service and other two awarded a recommendation of honor from the General Chief of Staff. Many other awarded with recommendation of honor from less senior commanders.
=== Operation Cast Lead ===

During the Gaza War (2008–2009) codenamed &quot;Operation Cast Lead&quot; by the IDF, combat engineering forces were the first to enter the Gaza Strip to clear IEDs, booby traps and open safe routes to armor and infantry.

Many booby traps, rigged structures and tunnels were present in the Gaza Strip as part of Hamas efforts to prepare to the Gaza War. These were often concealed in civilian structures, and were even found in schools and mosques. However, most of the Palestinian booby traps were successfully countered by the IDF Combat Engineering Corps bomb disposal experts (part of Yahalom Special Engineering Unit) which dismentaled the bombs and armored D9 bulldozers which detonated bombs and booby traps while sustaining no damage from the explosions. IDF Caterpillar D9R and unmanned &quot;Raam HaShachar&quot; D9N armored bulldozers which opened route in dangerous areas have taken many improvised explosive devices, landmines, explosive charges and RPG hits, but no crewmen were killed. However, a Yahalom bomb disposal expert was killed after entering a house and encountering a suicide bomber. He was the only fatality of the Combat Engineering Corps during the war.
Besides neutralizing Hamas IEDs and traps, combat engineering forces demolished Hamas infrastructure and other structures used as outposts, shooting positions, traps, cover for tunnels, HQs and warehouses. The head officer of the Combat Engineering Corps (קהנ&quot;ר) estimated that about 600 buildings were bulldozed or exploded by his troops.

The Combat Engineering Corps&#x27; success heightened their reputation within the IDF and in the Israeli public. This was manifested in increased number of conscripts who chose the Combat Engineering Corps as their first priority in their draft preferation questionnaire (&quot;Manila מנילה&quot;—a form in which the conscript chooses in what unit he would like to serve, the IDF tries to fulfill his request as much as possible).

=== Operation Protective Edge ===

During Operation Protective Edge (July–August 2014) Combat Engineers played a major role in destroying Hamas&#x27; cross-border underground infiltration tunnels. The tunnels were exposed and cleared by armored bulldozers and excavators, and then detonated by Yahalom&#x27;s Samoor unit. In total, about 32 tunnels were destroyed. In addition, combat engineers participated in the battles, neutralized Hamas-planted improvised explosive devices, cleared booby-traps, opened routes for armor and infantry, and destroyed terrorist infrastructure. Six combat engineers were killed during the battles in the Gaza Strip.

=== Operation Northern Shield ===
In late 2018 the IDF commenced Operation Northern Shield to detect, located and destroy Hezbollah tunnels dug into northern Israel from South Lebanon. The combat engineering corps played the major role in the operation, operating on ground and below it, deploying Yahalom tunnel warfare teams and heavy equipment. As for 12 January 2019, the IDF discovered 6 tunnels.

<text>In music, an invention is a short composition (usually for a keyboard instrument) in two-part counterpoint. (Compositions in the same style as an invention but using three-part counterpoint are known as &quot;sinfonias.&quot; Some modern publishers call them &quot;three-part inventions&quot; to avoid confusion with symphonies.) Well-known examples are the fifteen inventions that make up the first half of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Inventions and Sinfonias. Inventions are usually not performed in public, but serve as exercises for keyboard students, and as pedagogical exercises for composition students.

==Form==
Inventions are similar in style to a fugue, though they are much simpler. They consist of a short exposition, a longer development, and, sometimes, a short recapitulation. The key difference is that inventions do not generally contain an answer to the subject in fugue does. Two-part and three-part inventions are in contrapuntal style.

===Exposition===
In the exposition, a short motif is introduced by one voice in the tonic key. This is also known as the theme. The subject is then repeated in the second voice in the dominant key while the initial voice either plays a countersubject or plays in free counterpoint.

===Development===
The development comprises the bulk of the piece. Here the composer develops the subject by writing variations either melodically or harmonically. This usually involves the alternation of episodes with statements of the theme, similar to the development of a fugue. In minor- and major-mode inventions, the theme is typically restated in the relative major and the dominant, respectively. New key areas are reached through episodes, which usually move sequentially through the circle of fifths. The final episode ends on a half cadence in the original key, and is often exaggerated to make the subject sound extra special when it returns. Many of Bach‘s Inventions follow this plan, including BWV 775 and BWV 782.

===Recapitulation===
If an invention does have any recapitulation at all, it tends to be extremely short—sometimes only two or four measures. The composer repeats the theme in the upper voice and the piece ends. The repetition of the theme contains very little variation (or no variation at all) on the original theme. The lower line usually plays the countersubject, and if there is no countersubject, plays in free counterpoint. 

==History==
The invention is primarily a work of Johann Sebastian Bach. Inventions originated from contrapuntal improvisations in Italy, especially from the form of the composer Francesco Antonio Bonporti. Bach adapted and modified the form to what is considered to be a formal invention. Bach wrote 15 inventions (BWV 772–786) as exercises for his son, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. Bach later wrote a set of 15 three-part inventions, called sinfonias (BWV 787–801).

<text>A fireplace or [[hearth]] is a structure made of brick, stone or metal designed to contain a fire. Fireplaces are used for the relaxing ambiance they create and for heating a room. Modern fireplaces vary in heat efficiency, depending on the design.

Historically, they were used for heating a dwelling, cooking, and heating water for laundry and domestic uses. A fire is contained in a firebox or fire pit; a chimney or other flue allows exhaust gas to escape. A fireplace may have the following: a foundation, a hearth, a firebox, a mantel, a chimney crane (used in kitchen and laundry fireplaces), a grate, a lintel, a lintel bar, an overmantel, a damper, a smoke chamber, a throat, a flue, and a chimney filter or afterburner.

On the exterior, there is often a corbelled brick crown, in which the projecting courses of brick act as a drip course to keep rainwater from running down the exterior walls. A cap, hood, or shroud serves to keep rainwater out of the exterior of the chimney; rain in the chimney is a much greater problem in chimneys lined with impervious flue tiles or metal liners than with the traditional masonry chimney, which soaks up all but the most violent rain. Some chimneys have a spark arrestor incorporated into the crown or cap.

Organizations like the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington State Department of Ecology warn that, according to various studies, fireplaces can pose health risks. The EPA writes &quot;Smoke may smell good, but it&#x27;s not good for you.&quot;

==Types of fireplaces==
* Manufactured fireplaces are made with sheet metal or glass fire boxes.
* Electric fireplaces can be built-in replacements for wood or gas or retrofit with log inserts or electric fireboxes.
* A few types are wall mounted electric fireplaces, electric fireplace stoves, electric mantel fireplaces, and fixed or free standing electric fireplaces.

Masonry and prefabricated fireplaces can be fueled by:

*Wood fuel or firewood and other biomass
*Charcoal (carbonized biomass)
*Coal of various grades
*Coke (carbonized coal)
*Smokeless fuel of several types
*Flammable gases: propane, butane, and methane (natural gas is mostly methane, liquefied petroleum gas mostly propane)
*Ethanol (a liquid alcohol, also sold in gels)

Ventless fireplaces (duct free/room-venting fireplaces) are fueled by either gel, liquid propane, bottled gas or natural gas. In the United States, some states and local counties have laws restricting these types of fireplaces. They must be properly sized to the area to be heated. There are also air quality control issues due to the amount of moisture they release into the room air, and an oxygen sensor and a carbon monoxide detector are safety essentials.

Direct vent fireplaces are fueled by either liquid propane or natural gas. They are completely sealed from the area that is heated, and vent all exhaust gasses to the exterior of the structure.

Chimney and flue types:
* Masonry (brick or stone fireplaces and chimneys) with or without tile-lined flue.
* Reinforced concrete chimneys. Fundamental design flaws bankrupted the US manufacturers and made the design obsolete. These chimneys often show vertical cracks on the exterior.
* Metal-lined flue: Double- or triple-walled metal pipe running up inside a new or existing wood-framed or masonry chase.

Newly constructed flues may feature a chase cover, a cap, and a spark arrestor at the top to keep small animals out and to prevent sparks from being broadcast into the atmosphere. All gas fireplaces require trained gas service members to carry out installations.
===Accessories===
A wide range of accessories are used with fireplaces, which range between countries, regions, and historical periods. For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, fireguards, log boxes, andirons and pellet baskets, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate combustion. A grate (or fire grate) is a frame, usually of iron bars, to retain fuel for a fire. Heavy metal firebacks are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect the back of the fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set in front of the fireplace to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include pokers, bellows, tongs, shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, coal buckets, cabinet accessories and more.

==History==
Ancient fire pits were sometimes built in the ground, within caves, or in the center of a hut or dwelling. Evidence of prehistoric, man-made fires exists on all six inhabited continents. The disadvantage of early indoor fire pits was that they produced toxic and/or irritating smoke inside the dwelling.

Fire pits developed into raised hearths in buildings, but venting smoke depended on open windows or holes in roofs. The medieval great hall typically had a centrally located hearth, where an open fire burned with the smoke rising to the vent in the roof. Louvers were developed during the Middle Ages to allow the roof vents to be covered so rain and snow would not enter.

Also during the Middle Ages, smoke canopies were invented to prevent smoke from spreading through a room and vent it out through a wall or roof. These could be placed against stone walls, instead of taking up the middle of the room, and this allowed smaller rooms to be heated.

Chimneys were invented in northern Europe in the 11th or 12th century and largely fixed the problem of smoke, more reliably venting it outside. They made it possible to give the fireplace a draft, and also made it possible to put fireplaces in multiple rooms in buildings conveniently. They did not come into general use immediately, however, as they were expensive to build and maintain.

In 1678, Prince Rupert, nephew of Charles I, raised the grate of the fireplace, improving the airflow and venting system. The 18th century saw two important developments in the history of fireplaces. Benjamin Franklin developed a convection chamber for the fireplace that greatly improved the efficiency of fireplaces and wood-burning stoves. He also improved the airflow by pulling air from a basement and venting out a longer area at the top. In the later 18th century, Count Rumford designed a fireplace with a tall, shallow firebox that was better at drawing the smoke up and out of the building. The shallow design also improved greatly the amount of heat transfer projected into the room.

The Aesthetic movement of the 1870s and 1880s favoured a more traditional look based on stone, with simple designs and limited ornamentation. In the 1890s, the Aesthetic movement gave way to the Arts and Crafts movement, which still emphasized quality stone and practical features. Stone fireplaces at this time were a symbol of prosperity, as to some degree they remain today.

===Evolution of fireplace design===
Over time, the purpose of fireplaces has changed from one of necessity to one of visual interest. Early ones were more fire pits than modern fireplaces. They were used for warmth on cold days and nights, as well as for cooking. They also served as a gathering place within the home. These fire pits were usually centered within a room, allowing more people to gather around it.

Many flaws were found in early fireplace designs. Along with the Industrial Revolution, came large-scale housing developments, necessitating a standardization of fireplaces. The most renowned fireplace designers of this time were the Adam Brothers: John Adam, Robert Adam, and James Adam. They perfected a style of fireplace design that was used for generations. It was smaller, more brightly lit, with an emphasis on the quality of the materials used in their construction, instead of their size.

By the 1800s, most new fireplaces were made up of two parts, the surround and the insert. The surround consisted of the mantelpiece and side supports, usually in wood, marble or granite. The insert was where the fire burned, and was constructed of cast iron often backed with decorative tiles. As well as providing heat, the fireplaces of the Victorian era were thought to add a cosy ambiance to homes. In the US state of Wisconsin, some elementary classrooms would contain decorated fireplaces to ease children&#x27;s transition from home to school.

==Heating efficiency==

Some fireplace units incorporate a blower, which transfers more of the fireplace&#x27;s heat to the air via convection, resulting in a more evenly heated space and a lower heating load. Fireplace efficiency can also be increased with the use of a fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room. Firebacks are traditionally made from cast iron, but are also made from stainless steel.
Most older fireplaces have a relatively low efficiency rating. Standard, modern, wood-burning masonry fireplaces though have an efficiency rating of at least 80% (legal minimum requirement, for example, in Salzburg, Austria). To improve efficiency, fireplaces can also be modified by inserting special heavy fireboxes designed to burn much cleaner and can reach efficiencies as high as 80% in heating the air. These modified fireplaces are often equipped with a large fire window, enabling an efficient heating process in two phases. During the first phase the initial heat is provided through a large glass window while the fire is burning. During this time the structure, built of refractory bricks, absorbs the heat. This heat is then evenly radiated for many hours during the second phase. Masonry fireplaces without a glass fire window only provide heat radiated from its surface. Depending on the outside temperature, 1 to 2 daily firings are sufficient to ensure a constant room temperature.

==Health effects==
===Wood===
A literature review published in the &quot;Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health&quot; concludes that there are a wide variety of health risks posed by residential wood combustion. It states:

The Washington State Department of Ecology also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and respiratory systems are unable to filter particulates emitted by wood combustion, which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, carcinogens can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with respiratory diseases are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children, because it is associated with lower respiratory tract infections. Home fireplaces have caused fatal carbon monoxide poisoning.

===Gases and ethanol===
Propane, butane, and methane are all flammable gases used in fireplaces (natural gas is mostly methane, liquefied petroleum gas mostly propane). Gases can act as asphyxiant gases or cause gas explosions if they are allowed to accumulate unburned. Ethanol (a liquid, also sold in gels) fires can also cause severe burns.

Burning hydrocarbons can decrease indoor air quality. Emissions include airborne particulate matter (such as black carbon) and gases like nitrogen oxide. These harm health: they weaken the immune system, and increase infections, blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and insulin resistance. Some forms of fuel are more harmful than others.

Burning hydrocarbon fuels incompletely can produce carbon monoxide, which is highly poisonous and can cause death and long-term neurological disorders.

== Environmental effects ==
Burning any hydrocarbon fuel releases carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other emissions, such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, can be harmful to the environment.

<text>Ratatat ( ) is a Brooklyn-based electronic rock duo consisting of Mike Stroud (guitar, melodica, synthesizers, percussion) and producer Evan Mast (bass, synthesizers, percussion).

==History==

=== Beginnings and first album, &quot;Ratatat&quot; (2001–2005) ===

Evan Mast and Mike Stroud first met as students at Skidmore College. They started working together in 2001, recording several songs under the name &quot;Cherry&quot;. Stroud had previously toured with Dashboard Confessional in 2000.

Ratatat debuted in 2003 with the release of the single &quot;Seventeen Years&quot; on Mast&#x27;s and his brother Eric&#x27;s (E*Rock) record label Audio Dregs in the US and Rex Records in the UK. Mike Stroud had been a touring member of Ben Kweller&#x27;s band, but he &quot;had enough&quot; by 2003 and, after two years of touring, left the band after appearing on their second album, On My Way (released in 2004). Having signed for XL Recordings, Ratatat released their self-titled debut album, &quot;Ratatat&quot; and the single &quot;Germany to Germany&quot;. The album was written and recorded in Mast&#x27;s Crown Heights, Brooklyn apartment on his laptop. It is entirely instrumental with the exception of vocal excerpts at the beginning and end of select tracks.

In the following year, Ratatat supported the band Interpol on their tour. Also in 2004, Ratatat released &quot;Ratatat Remixes Vol. 1&quot; in co-operation with Audio Dregs, a compilation of remixed tracks by other artists, thereby garnering the attention of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

=== Second album, &quot;Classics&quot; (2006–2008)===
On August 22, 2006, Ratatat released their second album entitled &quot;Classics&quot; on XL Recordings.

On October 6, 2006, Ratatat became the first band to perform a public show inside the Guggenheim Museum in New York City.

On October 10, 2006, a new demo album from Ratatat titled &quot;9 Beats&quot; was leaked online. This set of tracks does not appear on any official discography listings. &quot;9 Beats&quot; was not an official album, the tracks consist of short instrumental electronic musical pieces and demos for their next mixtape. In 2007, this release was followed by their second volume of remixed tracks, &quot;Ratatat Remixes Vol. 2&quot;.

From June 2007 until October 2008, Ratatat had Martin Bonventre accompany them on their European tour and fall shows in America as the pianist/synthesizer player. Bonventre drew much attention due to his erratic dance movements on stage. The reason for him leaving the performance is unknown.

=== Third album, &quot;LP3&quot; (2008–2009) ===
Leading up to the release of Ratatat&#x27;s third album &quot;LP3&quot; on July 8, 2008, their official website showed the videos of the three first singles. &quot;Shiller&quot;, &quot;Shempi&quot; and then &quot;Mirando&quot; have all been released (or announced) on 7&quot; or 12&quot; singles. &quot;Shiller&quot;, the first to be released, featured a special b-side, the track &quot;Mahalo&quot; which was later also included on the fourth album, LP4.

In 2008, it was rumored that they would be signed by Star Trak Entertainment as the understudies of The Neptunes.

Ratatat contributed two songs to &quot;Man on the Moon: The End of Day&quot;, the debut album by alternative rapper Kid Cudi released September 15, 2009, &quot;Alive (Nightmare)&quot; and &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot;, the latter of which also featured MGMT. Cudi and Ratatat performed &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot; together on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on September 11, 2009.

=== Fourth album, &quot;LP4&quot; (2010–2014) ===
According to Mike Stroud in an interview with Paste Magazine released on August 4, 2009, &quot;most of [LP4] was recorded during the same studio sessions that yielded LP3&quot;. Ratatat&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;LP4&quot;, was released on June 8, 2010, via XL Recordings.

In 2010, Ratatat supported Vampire Weekend on their UK tour at The Brighton Centre and Alexandra Palace. Meanwhile, their song &quot;Neckbrace&quot; was used in the ski film &quot;The Way I See It&quot; by Matchstick Productions. In 2011, their track &quot;Mirando&quot; was used in Prada&#x27;s SS2011 ad campaign.

In August 2011, Ratatat was featured in the song &quot;Red Alert&quot; on CSS&#x27;s new album &quot;La Liberación&quot;.

On September 29, 2012, past collaborator Kid Cudi confirmed that Ratatat would be featured and producing on his upcoming third studio album &quot;Indicud&quot;, however the collaboration didn&#x27;t make the final cut after Kid Cudi decided to produce the whole album by himself, with the exception of an additional production by Hit-Boy on the track &quot;Red Eye&quot; featuring Haim.

In May 2013 they entered the Austrian Singlecharts after the Austrian network provider A1 used &quot;Loud Pipes&quot; for a radio-advertisement.

=== Fifth album, &quot;Magnifique&quot; (2015–present) ===

The band played Coachella Festival and Governor&#x27;s Ball Music Festival in 2015. They debuted their new song &quot;Cream On Chrome&quot; just a few hours before their night-ending Coachella set on April 11, 2015. The band also played a concert in Pomona, California on April 15, 2015, and at Primavera Sound in Barcelona in May.

In May 2015, the band announced that their fifth album, &quot;Magnifique&quot;, would be released on July 17, 2015, and feature a cover of the 1971 Springwater single &quot;I Will Return&quot;.

The first single from the album, the track &quot;Cream on Chrome&quot;, was voted number 52 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2015 held in January 2016. This is their second appearance on the annual countdown run by the Australian radio station, after featuring on Kid Cudi&#x27;s &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot;, which polled 33rd in the 2009 countdown.

== Live performances ==

Ratatat&#x27;s live performances bear strong similarities to the performances of the psychedelic rock bands out of San Francisco in the 1960s, with energetic light shows, swirling colors projected onto a screen, and clips of movies thrown in. Evan Mast creates and edits the videos that are projected on the screen. Many of them are included on their YouTube account.

Ratatat has toured with acts such as Björk, Daft Punk, Vampire Weekend, Mouse on Mars, Franz Ferdinand, CSS, the Faint, Super Furry Animals, Clinic, Panther, and the Killers.

<text>Messier 55 (also known as M55, [[New General Catalogue|NGC]] 6809, or Specter Cluster) is a globular cluster in the south of the constellation Sagittarius. It was discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752 while observing from what today is South Africa. Starting in 1754, Charles Messier made several attempts to find this object from Paris but its low declination meant from there it rises daily very little above the horizon, hampering observation. He observed and catalogued it in 1778. The cluster can be seen with 50 mm binoculars; resolving individual stars needs a medium-sized telescope.

It is about 17,600 light-years away from Earth. It contains about 269,000 solar masses (). As with other Milky Way globular clusters, it has few elements other than hydrogen and helium compared to the Sun. Messier 55 therefore has &quot;low metallicity&quot;. This quantity is normally listed as the base 10 logarithm of the proportion of the Sun; for NGC 6809 the metallicity is given by: [Fe/H] = −1.94 dex, whereby −2 would be 100 times less iron than the Sun. This means the cluster has 1.1% of the proportion of the Sun&#x27;s iron compared to hydrogen and helium.

Only about 55 variable stars have been found in the central part of M55.

<doc id="963972" wikidata="Q6199983" url="?curid=963972" title="John E. Sweeney">
<text>John Edward Sweeney (born August 9, 1955) is an American politician from the U.S. state of New York. A Republican, he represented New York&#x27;s 20th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from January 1999 to January 2007. He was dubbed &quot;Congressman Kick-Ass&quot; by President George W. Bush for his take-no-prisoners style. He was defeated for reelection in 2006 by Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand.

==Early life and education==
Sweeney was born in Troy, New York and graduated from Lansingburgh High School in 1973. He is of Irish and Armenian descent. He received an associate degree from Hudson Valley Community College in 1978 and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Science and Criminal Justice from the Sage College of Albany in 1981. In 1991, he received a J.D. from Western New England College School of Law.

In 2000, Toby Eglund wrote:

&quot;Sweeney ... embodies that embarrassment of the Left: the rightward drift of America&#x27;s white working class males. The son of a shirt factory worker active in the Amalgamated Shirt Cutters Union, and a sometime resident of a housing project, Sweeney grew up in the old, gritty industrial city of Troy, New York. He put himself through law school, and toiled as a minor county bureaucrat until, one day, he was discovered by Republican State Chairman William Powers who made him executive director of the New York state GOP in 1992.&quot;

==Political career==
===Early career and New York Republican Party executive director===
Sweeney was &quot;Rensselaer County&#x27;s one-time STOP-DWI coordinator.&quot;

He was the Executive Director &amp; Chief Counsel of the New York Republican Party from 1992 to 1995, a period of tremendous success for the state GOP. During Sweeney&#x27;s tenure at state Republican headquarters, Rudy Giuliani was elected mayor of New York City (the first Republican to win the mayor&#x27;s office in 28 years) and George Pataki was elected governor (the first Republican to win the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in 20 years) and Republicans made gains in both houses of the state legislature and at the local level. Sweeney was Governor Pataki&#x27;s first Commissioner of the State Department of Labor, from 1995 to 1997, then he moved to Governor Pataki&#x27;s inner-circle staff as Deputy Secretary to the Governor, from 1997 until he resigned to run for Congress.

===State Secretary of Labor under Pataki administration===
As Governor George Pataki&#x27;s Commissioner of Labor, Sweeney was the point-man on successful efforts to reform the Empire State&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Compensation laws. Before the reforms, enacted in 1996, New York&#x27;s workers&#x27; comp system had long been considered one of the most costly in the nation—57 percent higher than the national average, 53 percent higher than neighboring Massachusetts, 59 percent than neighboring Connecticut and 85 percent higher than neighboring New Jersey.

New York&#x27;s &quot;landmark&quot; workers&#x27; comp reforms created the Office of Workers&#x27; Compensation Fraud, an Inspector General, and a workers&#x27; compensation fraud unit at the State Insurance Department and elevated workers&#x27; comp fraud from a misdemeanor to a felony punishable by fines, restitution and incarceration.

===Congressional career===
====Election to U.S. House of Representatives in 1998====
Prior to the 1998 election, Sweeney moved from Cohoes to Speigletown, to run for the seat in the district of Republican Representative Gerald Solomon who was retiring. Sweeney was born, raised and lived most of his life in Solomon&#x27;s Congressional District. Solomon endorsed and campaigned for Sweeney, as did every Republican elected official and organization in the district.

Sweeney was elected to the US House in 1998, winning with 55 percent of the vote over Democratic challenger Jean Bordewich, despite the fact that President Bill Clinton carried the district over U.S. Senator Bob Dole in 1996 by a 46 percent to 41 percent margin.

====Re-elections====
In 2000, Sweeney defeated Democrat Kenneth McCallion, receiving 68 percent of the vote.

In 2002, he defeated Frank Stoppenbach, getting 73 percent of the vote.

In 2004, he defeated Doris F. Kelly, receiving 66 percent of the vote.

====Tenure and political positions====
Sweeney generally, but not invariably, supported the positions of his fellow Republicans in the House. Sweeney opposed same-sex marriage (asserting that &quot;a handful of activist judges have decided to undermine the will of the people&quot;), and in 2004 called for a federal constitutional amendment to ban recognition of same-sex marriage. Sweeney subsequently voted against such a constitutional amendment. Sweeney enjoyed a measure of support from organized labor. He received the endorsement of the Civil Service Employees Union and enjoyed good relations with the Teamsters. He opposed NAFTA, and in 2006 was one of 28 House Republicans to vote against the Oman–United States Free Trade Agreement, although he voted for CAFTA. He supported the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s position on the Iraq War, which was a focus of criticism from his opponent, Kirsten Gillibrand, in the 2006 race.

Sweeney opposed gun control.

He voted for prayer in public schools on numerous occasions and the National Education Association gives him an 18% approval rating.

After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, Sweeney and U.S. Representative James T. Walsh were two Republicans who cross party-lines to vote with Democrats on an effort in the House of Representatives to send $20 billion in emergency federal aid to New York City (the measure failed in the Appropriations Committee by a 33–31 vote). Although an ally of President George W. Bush, he called for the resignation of Bush&#x27;s Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff over proposed cuts in New York&#x27;s share in homeland security funding.

In 1999 and 2001, Sweeney introduced legislation (the &quot;Anti-Drug Legalization Act&quot;) that would ban all federal funding for research pertaining to drug legalization; the legislation did not advance. He voted against the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment.

Before being elected to Congress, Sweeney was considered a moderate Republican who favored abortion rights; by 2000, he was considered a strong abortion opponent, with a 90% anti-abortion record. He voted in favor of legislation that would make it a federal crime to transport minors across state lines for an abortion and thus circumvent state &quot;parental consent&quot; laws.

===2006 re-election campaign loss===
In August 2006, Sweeney&#x27;s allies filed successfully against signatures on Libertarian opponent Eric Sundwall&#x27;s ballot petitions, resulting in Sundwall&#x27;s name being removed from the general election ballot. However, Sweeney still lost the general election on November 7, 2006, to Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand with 47% of the vote.

===Political activity after leaving Congress===
Following his congressional tenure, Sweeney returned to the political process both locally and nationally as an election and compliance lawyer and strategist.

In 2012, Sweeney worked for Newt Gingrich&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

In April 2016, Sweeney was hired by Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign to help organize New York during the primary and do compliance work.

After Trump&#x27;s election day victory, Sweeney, as the campaign&#x27;s deputy counsel, led the effort on the ground in Wisconsin and Michigan to protect the campaign&#x27;s advantage in those two key swing states during the recounts initiated by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, and supported by Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign.

In December 2016, Sweeney joined the executive committee of Trump&#x27;s transition team. Sweeney was later promoted to a four-member &quot;Tiger Team&quot; for Trump, tasked with conducting interviews with potential nominees for ambassadorships and other high-level positions in various federal departments and agencies.

==Controversies==

===Role in Florida recount in 2000===

During the 2000 election, Sweeney allegedly helped earn his nickname from President Bush, &quot;Congressman Kick-Ass,&quot; by organizing the so-called Brooks Brothers riot that disrupted the Florida elections commissioners. He was said to have led the charge on the third recount in Miami, flying in GOP operatives and instructing them to &quot;shut it down!&quot; by raising a clamor and pounding on the election commission&#x27;s doors. Sweeney used the words &quot;thugs&quot; to describe the Florida officials involved in the recount. He defended his actions in connection with the incident as &quot;completely and absolutely legitimate&quot; and declared that his intent was only to stop the canvassing board from withdrawing its activities from public view.

Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, in his book &quot;Winning Right&quot;, wrote that the night before the recount began in Miami-Dade County, Sweeney was one of about a dozen Bush campaign operatives who gathered at Joe&#x27;s Stone Crab in South Beach, that set out the campaign&#x27;s media strategy. Gillespie recalled that Sweeney said, &#x27;I know what I&#x27;m going to say tomorrow morning. &#x27;I&#x27;m going to say that Joseph Stalin said, &#x27;It doesn&#x27;t matter who casts the votes, it only matters who counts the votes.&#x27; And these people are worse than Stalin.&#x27; He ended up holding the Stalin quotation until the 5:30 pm wrap-up.&quot;

===Congressional ethics controversies===
In September 2006, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) included Sweeney on its annual list of &quot;The 20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress,&quot; citing ethical concerns arising from a &quot;ski trip to New York, the exchange of legislative assistance for campaign contributions and the hiring of his wife as a campaign fundraiser.&quot;

====Wife as fundraiser====
On April 11, 2003, Sweeney began paying a company called Creative Consulting for fund-raising. The company had been founded a day earlier by Gaia &quot;Gayle&quot; Ford. Between April 2003 and December 2003, Sweeney&#x27;s campaign paid $42,570 to the firm. Sweeney proposed to Ford in September 2003 and married her in 2004.

Sweeney spokeswoman Melissa Carlson said the congressman considers his wife &quot;his best representative in the district when he&#x27;s fund-raising.&quot; She said Ford, who had no previous fund-raising experience, receives a 10 percent commission on whatever she raises. Between January 2005 and April 2006, Ford was paid $30,879. Sweeney also has had a fundraising consultant on monthly retainer since June 2004, who is paid $8,583 a month.

Ford also works for Powers &amp; Company, the lobbying firm of former state GOP Chairman William Powers, Sweeney&#x27;s longtime political ally and onetime boss.

====Publicly funded ski trips====
The Winter Challenge was started in 1998 by Sweeney&#x27;s House predecessor, Gerald Solomon, with the declared purpose of showcasing the Olympic facilities at Lake Placid, New York to congressmen and their staffers in hopes of getting federal funds; Sweeney has hosted the annual event since 1999.

In January 2006, Sweeney, his wife, and about 60 other people spent a four-day weekend at the facilities, competing against each other in skating, downhill skiing and bobsledding events. The group included Representative Pete Sessions (R-TX), a close friend of Sweeney and his wife; and aides to U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), Representative Randy Kuhl (R-NY), and Representative Bart Stupak (D-MI). The weekend cost the Olympic Regional Development Authority (ORDA) $27,500, plus in-kind services it provided and the costs of operating the Olympic venues for the competition (exact figures for the latter two were unavailable). ORDA is a part of the New York State government.

In the fall of 2005, the House ethics panel told Sweeney in a letter that he should be careful to let the Olympics groups invite guests to avoid the appearance of an endorsement by the House. &quot;Once the ORDA and the U.S. Olympic Committee — without your involvement — have issued an initial invitation to House members and staff to take part in the trip, you may send a follow-up to that invitation&quot;, the ethics panel, known formally as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, wrote to Sweeney.

Invitations to the event officially come from ORDA and the U.S. Olympic Committee, a nonprofit group chartered by Congress. ORDA says the impetus for the event comes from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The U.S. Olympic Committee said it&#x27;s really Sweeney&#x27;s event. Three committees of the NY State Assembly have launched investigations of the Challenge, focusing on whether public money was put to good use. ORDA President Ted Blazer, speaking at one such hearing, said Sweeney&#x27;s office helped assemble lists of possible invitees to the event.

Documents show that at least eight members of Congress, all Republicans, were also invited to attend the 2006 event but declined.

The official invitation for the event read: &quot;While this trip has proven itself to be an enjoyable one for delegation members in the past, it is, nevertheless, an official trip authorized by the House and Senate Ethics Committees . . . intended to provide an opportunity for Members of Congress and Congressional staff to inspect and evaluate the manner in which federal funds have been used to strengthen the area&#x27;s tourism industry.&quot;

Despite the House ethics rule requiring all travel paid by others to relate to members&#x27; official duties, and the ethics panel&#x27;s letter that said that recreational activities must be &quot;merely incidental to the trip&quot;, Sweeney has said that the panel said &quot;it&#x27;s perfectly appropriate for me to promote the event.&quot;

The group attending the event included at least 15 registered lobbyists, including Pete Card, a former staffer of Sweeney&#x27;s and the brother of former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, and Lisi Kaufman, a lobbyist for United Technologies Corporation, the sister of Andrew and Pete. In his request to the House ethics committee, Sweeney did not ask about lobbyists. A spokesman for ORDA said he does not know why the lobbyists were invited.

Seven of the lobbyists had contributed a total of $12,400 to Sweeney&#x27;s campaign in 2005.

====Ties to Allen Stanford====
Sweeney was part of a group of lawmakers known as the Caribbean Caucus, sponsored by disgraced financier Allen Stanford. The group, formed to promote relations with Caribbean nations, took 11 trips to places like St. Croix, Montego Bay and Key Biscayne. The meetings, which included receptions with lobster, caviar and wine, cost $311,307 and were paid for by the Inter-American Economic Council, a non-profit funded by Stanford. Other members of the Caucus included convicted influence peddler Rep. Bob Ney and close Sweeney friend Rep. Pete Sessions. In 2004, Stanford hosted a wedding reception for Sweeney and wife at the Pavilion Restaurant, owned by Stanford. At the time, Sweeney told the Antigua Sun &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for Allen, I certainly would not be here today.&quot;

===Disputed domestic violence report===
On October 31, 2006, the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; reported on a 9-1-1 call made by Sweeney&#x27;s wife in December 2005, in which she complained that her husband had been &quot;&#x27;knocking her around&#x27; during a late-night argument at the couple&#x27;s home.&quot; The responding officers filed a domestic incident report, which states that Sweeney allegedly grabbed his wife &quot;by the neck&quot; and pushed her around the house.

John and Gaia Sweeney subsequently said they would give the New York State Police permission to release a report about the incident. They said that the report was inaccurate but have not disputed its contents. On November 17, 2006, the &quot;Times Union&quot; reported that there were two versions of the domestic violence report that had been prepared by the State Police, one that was sent to them, doctored and lacking details, and the original report.

On July 22, 2007, the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; reported that Gaia Sweeney, who was contesting a divorce action by her husband, said that he was often verbally abusive and at times physically abused her during their marriage. She also said that a statement she made on the eve of last fall&#x27;s election, denying marital abuse, was &quot;coerced&quot;. Sweeney denied that he had been abusive; he had recently obtained a judicial order of protection against his wife.

Sweeney&#x27;s first wife, Betty Sweeney, of Schaghticoke, told the &quot;Times-Union&quot; that she had &quot;never observed any kind of behavior like that towards me or anybody else.&quot;

The State Police moved to demote a State Police captain weeks after the November 2006 election, alleging that he had leaked the police report on Sweeney. The captain denied leaking the report, saying he was wrongly accused, and the captain was supported by the New York State Police Benevolent Association (PBA), who called the captain a scapegoat. The officer was ultimately not demoted, but was transferred to a different role that resulted in lower pay.

===Alcohol issues===
====Attendance at college fraternity party====
In April 2006, news outlets reported that Sweeney had attended a party at Union College&#x27;s Alpha Delta Phi house in Schenectady; photographs surfaced of the congressman at the party, and the student newspaper &quot;Concordiensis&quot; cited witnesses stating that he was visibly intoxicated. Democrats ridiculed Sweeney over the embarrassing photos; Sweeney said through a spokeswoman that he had briefly spoken to students and posed for photos before departing, and that he was not drinking during the event.

====DWI convictions in 2007 and 2009====
Sweeney was charged with aggravated DWI when he was arrested by New York State Police at 1:19 a.m. on November 11, 2007, on the Adirondack Northway, a stretch of Interstate 87. Sweeney&#x27;s car had reportedly been swerving and a 24-year-old woman was seated partially on his lap when spotted by a state trooper. Sweeney&#x27;s blood alcohol content registered at .18 percent, more than double the legal limit. Sweeney issued an apology, and on November 14, 2007, Sweeney pleaded guilty to drunk driving after his attorney vocally and publicly denied he had even been drinking that evening. Sweeney paid a US$1,000 fine, but avoided jail time. His license was suspended for six months and had to attend a victim impact panel for drunken drivers.

Early on the morning of April 5, 2009, Sweeney was pulled over by state police for speeding. He refused a breathalyzer test ordered by the officer, and according to a newspaper report, &quot;Sweeney allegedly told the officers he would not pass the sobriety test, adding he was in &#x27;big trouble.&#x27;&quot; Sweeney was charged with felony DWI (since he had a prior DWI conviction within the past 10 years). in a February 2010 plea deal, Sweeney admitted to driving drunk and pleaded guilty to lesser charges, specifically a misdemeanor count. The agreement allowed Sweeney to avoid a felony conviction and thus avoid disbarment. He was sentenced to 30 days in county jail, and was released in April 2010 after serving 17 days. In addition to jail, Sweeney was also sentenced to three years of probation, 300 hours of community service, and was ordered to pay $2,000 in fines and surcharges. His driver&#x27;s license was revoked, and Sweeney also had to wear an ankle bracelet to detect alcohol consumption.

====Recovery from alcoholism====
In 2011, Sweeney told a reporter that he had been sober since April 6, 2009. He stated that others had spoken to him about his drinking since the late 1990s and that he had been a &quot;highly functional alcoholic&quot; during his career in elected office. He described making amends with his family, describing his biggest loss from drinking as not the loss of his seat in Congress, but &quot;the loss of myself and the loss of everything that went with it, the harm and hurt I created for people around me who I love and love me.&quot;

2019 Troy Mayoral Election

In November 2019, leaked audio from a verbally abusive private meeting between McLaughlin, several of his top political and governmental aides, Sweeney, and then-Republican candidate for Troy mayor Thomas Reale, was published by the Times Union. During the meeting, McLaughlin, County Director of Operations Richard Christ, County Director of Purchasing James Gordon, and Sweeney pressured Reale to drop out of the mayoral race and endorse Rodney Wiltshire, a third-party candidate defeated in the Democratic primary by incumbent Democratic Mayor Patrick Madden. Mr. Reale remained in the race and was defeated by Madden in the general election.

==Personal life==
Sweeney has three adult children from his first marriage. He lives in Clifton Park, New York. He has two young children with his wife, Erin, and two step-children from her prior marriage.

Sweeney&#x27;s father was the leader of a shirt-cutter&#x27;s union in Troy, NY.

<text>Carole MacNeil is a Canadian television journalist, known for her work with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which spanned over thirty years.

MacNeil began her career anchoring local news programs in New Brunswick and Ontario in the early 1990s, before joining CBC Newsworld in 1998. Her most recent program was &quot;CBC Rundown with Carole MacNeil&quot;, a daytime news program on CBC News Network.

==Biography==
MacNeil grew up in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. From 1990 to 1994, she worked at CBC affiliate station CHSJ-TV in Fredericton, New Brunswick, where she was a co-anchor for the evening news program and the host of a current affairs program. In October 1994, she moved to Windsor, Ontario, where she became the anchor of the local evening newscast on CBET, the local CBC station. MacNeil replaced David Kyle as the station&#x27;s late-night news anchor in February 1996, becoming the anchor of both the evening and late-night newscasts. Leaving the Windsor station in August 1998, she joined CBC Newsworld as a co-anchor of the CBC morning news program with Ralph Benmergui.

In 2000, MacNeil helped launch &quot;Canada Now&quot;, the supper hour news program on CBC Television.

In February 2002, MacNeil and Evan Solomon became the host of &quot;CBC News: Sunday Night&quot;, an hour-long prime time news broadcast on CBC Television, as well as on CBC Newsworld. CBC News Sunday won several Gemini Awards. At the 24th Gemini Awards in 2009, one of MacNeil&#x27;s reports for &quot;CBC News: Sunday Night&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Lifestyle/practical information segment&quot;. The program was cancelled in May 2009 during a restructuring of CBC News by CBC executive Richard Stursberg, who MacNeil married weeks later in June 2009.
In 2011, the CBC Ombudsman was called to review MacNeil&#x27;s on-air statements concerning the Six Day War. Upon review the &quot;CBC acknowledged it was misleading for [MacNeil] to assert that neighbouring countries attacked Israel.&quot;

MacNeil joined the CBC in May 1987, and celebrated her 25th anniversary in 2012. From October 2012 to September 2013, MacNeil took a leave of absence and studied abroad in France.

In October 2021, MacNeil announced that she would be departing from CBC News later that month. Her last broadcast on &quot;CBC Rundown with Carole MacNeil&quot; took place on October 26, 2021.

<doc id="963979" wikidata="Q2348311" url="?curid=963979" title="Jerrie Cobb">
<text>Geraldyn M. Cobb (March 5, 1931 – March 18, 2019), commonly known as Jerrie Cobb, was an American pilot and aviator. She was also part of the Mercury 13, a group of women who underwent physiological screening tests at the same time as the original Mercury Seven astronauts, and was the first to complete each of the tests.

Cobb set three aviation records in her 20s: the 1959 world record for non-stop long-distance flight, the 1959 world light-plane speed record, and a 1960 world altitude record for lightweight aircraft of . In 1960, &quot;Life Magazine&quot; named her as one of nine women of the &quot;100 most important young people in the United States&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born on March 5, 1931, in Norman, Oklahoma, Cobb was the daughter of Lt. Col. William H. Cobb and Helena Butler Stone Cobb. From birth, Cobb was on the move, as is common for many children of military families. Weeks after she was born, Cobb&#x27;s family moved to Washington, D.C., where her grandfather, Ulysses Stevens Stone, was serving in the United States House of Representatives. After Ulysses Stone lost a re-election bid, the family moved back to Oklahoma, where he and Cobb&#x27;s father worked as automobile salesmen. Once the United States became involved in World War II, Cobb&#x27;s family moved once again, this time to Wichita Falls, Texas, where Cobb&#x27;s father joined his active U.S. National Guard unit. The family later moved again to Denver, Colorado, before finally returning to Oklahoma after World War II, where Cobb spent the majority of her childhood in Ponca City.

As a child growing up in Oklahoma, Cobb took to aviation at an early age, with her pilot father&#x27;s encouragement. She first flew at age twelve, in her father&#x27;s open cockpit 1936 Waco biplane. At 16, she was barnstorming around the Great Plains in a Piper J-3 Cub, dropping leaflets over little towns announcing the arrival of circuses. Sleeping under the Cub&#x27;s wing at night, she helped scrape together money for fuel to practice her flying by giving rides. By the age of 17, while a student at Oklahoma City Classen High School, Cobb had earned her private pilot&#x27;s license. She received her commercial pilot&#x27;s license a year later, on her 18th birthday. In 1948, Cobb attended Oklahoma College for Women for a year.

== Career ==
Facing sex discrimination and the return of many qualified male pilots after World War II, Cobb took on less-sought-after flying jobs, such as patrolling pipelines and crop dusting. She went on to earn her multi-engine, instrument, flight instructor, and ground instructor ratings, as well as her airline transport license. At the age of 21, she was delivering military fighters and four-engined bombers to foreign air forces worldwide.

When Cobb became the first woman to fly in the 1959 Paris Air Show, the world&#x27;s largest air exposition, her fellow pilots named her Pilot of the Year and awarded her the Amelia Earhart Gold Medal of Achievement.

Cobb played women&#x27;s softball for money on a semi-professional team, the Oklahoma City Queens, to save up to buy a surplus World War II Fairchild PT-23 so that she could be self-employed.

By 1959, at age 28, Cobb was a pilot and manager for Aero Design and Engineering Company, which also made the Aero Commander aircraft that she used in her record-making feats. She was one of the few female executives in aviation. By 1960, she had accrued 7,000 hours of flying time.

In November 1960, following a number of crashes of the Lockheed L-188 Electra, American Airlines&#x27; marketing department identified that the aircraft&#x27;s reputation was poor among women, which was adversely affecting passenger bookings. American Airlines had no female pilots so, in an attempt to win over passengers, the airline invited Cobb to fly the aircraft on a highly publicized four-hour test, her first turboprop flight.

In May 1961 NASA Administrator James Webb appointed Cobb as a consultant to the NASA space program.

== Medical testing ==

Although Cobb successfully completed all three stages of physical and psychological evaluation that were used in choosing the first seven Mercury astronauts, it was not an official NASA program, and she was unable to rally support in Congress for adding women to the astronaut program. At the time, Cobb had flown 64 types of propeller aircraft, but had made only one flight in a jet fighter, in the back seat. As a NASA historian wrote:

In 1962, Cobb was called to testify before a Congressional hearing, the Special Subcommittee on the Selection of Astronauts, about female astronauts. Astronaut John Glenn stated at the hearing that &quot;men go off and fight the wars and fly the airplanes&quot;, and &quot;the fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order&quot;. Only a few months later, the Soviet Union sent the first woman into space, Valentina Tereshkova. Soon afterward, Tereshkova sympathized with Cobb: &quot;They (American leaders) shout at every turn about their democracy and at the same time they announce they will not let a woman into space. This is open inequality.&quot;

Along with other Mercury 13 participants, including Jane Briggs Hart, Cobb lobbied to be allowed to train alongside the men. At the time, however, NASA requirements for entry into the astronaut program were that the applicant be a military test pilot, experienced at high-speed military test flying, and have an engineering background, enabling them to take over controls in the event it became necessary. Since all military test pilots were men at the time, that effectively excluded women. Liz Carpenter, the executive assistant to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, drafted a letter to NASA administrator, James E. Webb, questioning those requirements, but Johnson did not send the letter, instead writing across it: &quot;Let&#x27;s stop this now!&quot;

== Later life and death ==
Cobb then began over 30 years of missionary work in South America with MAF, performing humanitarian flying (e.g., transporting supplies to indigenous tribes), as well as surveying new air routes to remote areas. Cobb &quot;pioneered new air routes across the hazardous Andes Mountains and Amazon rain forests, using self-drawn maps that guided her over uncharted territory larger than the United States&quot;. She has been honored by the Brazilian, Colombian, Ecuadorian, French, and Peruvian governments. In 1981, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work.

In 1999, the National Organization for Women conducted an unsuccessful campaign to send Cobb into space to investigate the effects of aging, as John Glenn had done. Glenn&#x27;s main purpose was to observe the effects of a micro-gravity environment on the body of an aged individual. Specifically, NASA wanted to see whether the effects of weightlessness had positive consequences on the balance, metabolism, blood flow, and other bodily functions of an elderly person. Cobb believed that it was necessary to send an aged woman on a space flight as well, to determine whether the same effects witnessed in men would be witnessed in women. At 67, Cobb, who had passed the same tests as John Glenn, petitioned NASA for the chance to participate in such a space flight, but NASA stated &quot;it had no plans to involve additional senior citizens in upcoming launches&quot;. Many aviators and astronauts of the time believed that was a failed chance for NASA to right a wrong they had committed years before, but Cobb never reached her ultimate goal of space flight.

Cobb received numerous aviation honors, including the Harmon Trophy and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&#x27;s Gold Wings Award.

On March 18, 2019, thirteen days after her 88th birthday, Cobb died at her home in Florida.

While independent filmmaker Mary Haverstick was researching a documentary she wanted to make about Cobb in 2009 to 2011, she was warned by a high-ranking woman from the US Department of Defense not to delve too deeply into Cobb&#x27;s life. Her curiosity aroused, further research led Haverstick to discover that another woman, June Cobb, shared an extraordinary amount of biographical detail with Jerrie Cobb. In a subsequent interview, Jerrie Cobb denied she was June Cobb, but said, &quot;I heard she impersonated me for a while.&quot; When Haverstick suggested that June Cobb had flown a plane waiting at Redbird Airport, Dallas, on November 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was killed, which had been standing on the runway for an hour with engines running, and was rumored to be the get-away plane for Lee Harvey Oswald, Jerrie Cobb reacted strongly, but gathered herself and said, &quot;I was at the Redbird Airport.&quot; Haverstick concluded that Jerrie Cobb was a spy who used the name June Cobb. This, however, remains unproven.

==In popular culture==
Laurel Ollstein&#x27;s 2017 play, &quot;They Promised Her the Moon&quot;, (revised in 2019) tells the story of Jerrie Cobb and her struggle to become an astronaut.

Sonya Walger portrays the character Molly Cobb, based on Jerrie Cobb, in the 2019 alternate history TV series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, in which Cobb becomes the first American woman in space. Episode four of the first season, &quot;Prime Crew&quot;, is dedicated to her memory.

Cobb is portrayed by Mamie Gummer in the 2020 Disney+ series &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.

Cobb is the main character in a 2023 book by Mary Haverstick titled &quot;A Woman I Know: Female Spies, Double Identities, and a New Story of the Kennedy Assassination&quot;

<doc id="963986" wikidata="Q105624" url="?curid=963986" title="The Bourne Identity (2002 film)">
<text>The Bourne Identity is a 2002 action-thriller film directed by Doug Liman and written by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron. Based on Robert Ludlum&#x27;s 1980 novel of the same name, it is the first installment in the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise, and the film stars Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. In the film, Jason Bourne (Damon) suffers from psychogenic amnesia and is forced to fight to unlock his identity and his mysterious connection to the CIA.

Attempts to develop a feature film adaptation of Ludlum&#x27;s novel first began in 1981 but stalled after being passed to different distributors, with Warner Bros. producing a television film adaptation in 1988. Liman revived the feature film project in 1996 and worked with Ludlum and David Self on its screenplay after Gilroy initially declined: Gilroy made several changes to the script upon joining, with additional contributions from Herron. After Damon and Potente were cast, principal photography began in October 2000 and lasted until February 2001, with filming taking place in Paris, Prague, Imperia, Rome, Mykonos, and Zürich. Production was troubled: the creators frequently clashed with studio executives over delays, costs, last-minute changes, and unexpected reshoots.

Originally set for release in September 2001, it was theatrically released in the United States on June 14, 2002, by Universal Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the direction, Damon&#x27;s performance, action sequences, and characters: it is considered one of the most influential action films of all time. It grossed $214 million worldwide and was followed by the sequels &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), and &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; (2016).

==Plot==

In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian fishermen rescue an American man adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. Tending to his wounds, they find he has amnesia but shows advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. A tiny laser projector found implanted in his hip gives the number of a safe deposit box in Zurich, so he goes to investigate.

In the deposit box he finds various currencies, passports, IDs with different names, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun and starts using the name on the American passport, Jason Bourne. After Bourne&#x27;s departure, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a CIA black ops program. Its head, Alexander Conklin, issues alerts to police to capture Bourne and assigns three agents – codenamed Castel, Manheim, and the Professor – to kill him.

CIA Deputy Director Ward Abbott contacts Conklin about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Wombosi, who promises to deal with the agent who failed. Bourne evades the Swiss police by using his U.S. passport to enter the American consulate but is pursued by Marine guards.

Bourne escapes after offering $20,000 to Marie Kreutz, a 26-year-old German he saw at the consulate, to drive him to an address in Paris. From the apartment, Bourne uses the phone to contact a hotel to inquire about the names on his passports. A &quot;John Michael Kane&quot; was registered but died two weeks before in a car crash. Castel ambushes Bourne and Marie in the apartment, but Bourne gets the upper hand. Instead of allowing himself to be interrogated, Castel throws himself from a window to his death.

While searching through Castel&#x27;s belongings, Marie finds wanted posters of Bourne and herself and so agrees to help him. After they evade the police in Marie&#x27;s car, they spend the night in a Paris hotel.

Meanwhile, Wombosi obsesses over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, has planted a body identified as John Michael Kane in a Paris morgue to appear to be the assailant. Wombosi is unconvinced and threatens to report the CIA&#x27;s actions to the media. The Professor then assassinates Wombosi on Conklin&#x27;s orders.

Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about the failed assassination attempt on Wombosi&#x27;s yacht, and that the assassin was shot twice in the back during the escape, ultimately realizing that he was responsible for the attempt. He and Marie take refuge in the French countryside home of Marie&#x27;s half-brother Eamon and his children.

Under pressure from Abbott to handle the matter, Conklin tracks Bourne&#x27;s location and sends the Professor to kill him. Bourne mortally wounds the Professor, who reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and the children away for their protection. He then contacts Conklin via the Professor&#x27;s phone, and they agree to meet alone in Paris.

When Bourne sees that Conklin is not alone, he abandons their meeting but places a tracking device on his car, leading Bourne to the Treadstone safe house in Paris. He breaks in and holds Conklin and logistics technician Nicky Parsons at gunpoint. Conklin reveals his association with Treadstone and presses him to remember his past. Bourne recalls his attempt to assassinate Wombosi through successive flashbacks.

Under orders from Treadstone, Bourne had infiltrated Wombosi&#x27;s yacht and got close enough to assassinate him. However, Bourne could not kill Wombosi while his children were present so instead fled, being shot during his escape and losing his memory.

Bourne announces he is resigning from Treadstone and warns Conklin not to follow him. As agents descend on the safe house, he fights his way out. As Conklin leaves, he is killed by Manheim under Abbott&#x27;s orders. Abbott then shuts down Treadstone. He reports to an oversight committee that Treadstone is a &quot;decommissioned&quot; former program of theoretical game-scenario exercises before discussion turns to a new project codenamed &quot;Blackbriar&quot;.

Some time later, Bourne finds Marie renting out scooters to tourists on Mykonos, and they reunite.

==Cast==

In addition, Julia Stiles appears as Nicolette (Nicky Parsons), in a role that would be elevated to main cast billing in three later films of the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise.

==Production==

===Development===
Attempts to develop a film adaptation of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; began in 1981, when film producer Anthony Lazzarino and Ludlum&#x27;s literary agent Henry Morrison&#x27;s company Windwood/Glen Productions purchased the film rights to the novel shortly after its publication. Morrison left the company shortly afterwards, and Lazzarino optioned the film to Orion Pictures in exchange for a 3.75 percent interest and a presentation credit. This option was eventually acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures, which intended to make a film adaptation directed by Jack Clayton and starring Burt Reynolds. However, the film did not move forward because Reynolds was uninterested. Warner Bros. produced a television adaptation of the novel for ABC in 1988, but otherwise did nothing with its option and allowed the rights to revert back to the Ludlum estate in 1999.

Director Doug Liman had been a fan of the source novel by Robert Ludlum since he read it in high school. Near the end of production of Liman&#x27;s previous film &quot;Swingers&quot; in 1996, Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. However, he could not initially move forward with the project because Warner Bros. still owned the film rights. After more than two years of securing rights to the book and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production. Universal Pictures acquired the film rights to Ludlum&#x27;s books in the hopes of starting a new film franchise, and because studio CEO Stacey Snider later admitted to being &quot;intrigued by the pairing of an independent-minded filmmaker with a familiar studio genre.&quot; Ludlum approved of the adaptation after befriending Liman, who repeatedly visited the author&#x27;s home in Glacier National Park, Montana, to consult him.

=== Writing ===
David Self was brought in to write the screenplay in 1999 after Gilroy initially declined the offer. His screenplay was more faithful to the original novel. Unlike Liman, Gilroy disliked Ludlum&#x27;s novels and considered them poorly suited to a film adaptation, calling Self&#x27;s original script &quot;a huge fifteen-gunmen-on-the-Metro-blowing-the-fuck-out-of-everything kind of movie.&quot; However, Gilroy agreed to write a new screenplay for the film after Liman took his advice to abandon everything from the original novel except for the basic plot involving &quot;a guy who finds the only thing he knows how to do is kill people.&quot; Gilroy subsequently rewrote almost the entire film, although William Blake Herron was later brought in to rewrite Gilroy&#x27;s script to have more action. Most of Herron&#x27;s rewrites were abandoned after Matt Damon threatened to quit the role of Bourne if they were included in support of Liman and Gilroy, but Herron still received a writer&#x27;s credit after the opening scene he composed for the film was included.

Gilroy&#x27;s new script rewrote the Treadstone program and its director Alexander Conklin into the film&#x27;s primary antagonists; in the novel both they and Bourne had been pursuing the terrorist &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot; and Treadstone had only tried to assassinate Bourne because they believed he had deliberately gone rogue from his mission after his amnesia. &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot; could not appear as an antagonist in the film at all because in real life he had been captured and imprisoned by the French government in 1994. The film&#x27;s portrayal of Treadstone was inspired by Liman&#x27;s father Arthur L. Liman&#x27;s memoirs regarding his involvement as chief counsel for the United States Senate investigation of the Iran–Contra affair. Many aspects of the Alexander Conklin character were based on his father&#x27;s recollections of Oliver North. Gilroy also abandoned the novel&#x27;s original backstory for Bourne as a former Foreign Service officer recruited to the United States Army Special Forces during the Vietnam War after his family had been killed in the secret bombing of Cambodia and posing as an assassin named &quot;Cain&quot; to lure &quot;Carlos&quot; out of hiding. Liman admitted that he jettisoned much of the content of the novel beyond the central premise, in order to modernize the material and to conform it to his own beliefs regarding United States foreign policy. However, Liman was careful not to cram his political views down &quot;the audience&#x27;s throat&quot;.

There were initial concerns regarding the film&#x27;s possible obsolescence and overall reception in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. As a result, producer Frank Marshall reshot a new ending in which Ward Abbott offers to recruit Bourne back to the CIA and abandons the agency&#x27;s pursuit of him even after he declines. The ending was not included in the theatrical cut because it was deemed too different from the rest of the film.

===Casting===

Liman approached a wide range of actors for the role of Bourne, including Brad Pitt, who turned it down to star in &quot;Spy Game&quot;, as well as Russell Crowe, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, before he eventually cast Damon. Liman found that Damon understood and appreciated that, though &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; would have its share of action, the focus was primarily on character and plot. Damon, who had never played such a physically demanding role, insisted on performing many of the stunts himself. With stunt choreographer Nick Powell, he underwent three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, boxing, and the Filipino martial art eskrima. He eventually performed a significant number of the film&#x27;s stunts himself, including hand-to-hand combat and climbing the safe house walls near the film&#x27;s conclusion.

Liman initially intended to cast Sarah Polley in the role of Marie, but she declined. After Franka Potente was cast instead, the role was rewritten from a Canadian economist to a German drifter.

===Filming===
Filming began in October 2000. From the onset of filming, difficulties with the studio slowed the film&#x27;s development and caused a rift between Liman, Gilroy, and Universal Pictures. The first problems started after Liman and Damon demanded the abandonment of Herron&#x27;s re-written script shortly before production started despite the fact that extensive preparations had already been made to film it. Liman also insisted on shooting the film on location in Paris rather than the cheaper option of Montreal, despite the fact that this meant the film&#x27;s French-speaking crew was unable to understand the English-speaking cast and director. Executives were unhappy with the film&#x27;s pacing, emphasis on small-scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. The film&#x27;s original producer Richard N. Gladstein also quit the film at the beginning of production due to his wife&#x27;s pregnancy, resulting in delays until he was replaced by Frank Marshall.

Liman demanded a number of reshoots and rewrites late in development and throughout production, sometimes in the middle of a shoot. This resulted in scheduling problems which delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. Particular points of contention with regard to the original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film&#x27;s conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience&#x27;s understanding of the Bourne character and the film&#x27;s central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product. Although Marshall ultimately sided with Liman to get the farmhouse sequence filmed, they got into an intense fight on set after Liman abruptly insisted on another reshoot to record a shot he had forgotten to include.

Other issues included poor test audience reactions to the film&#x27;s Paris finale. The latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new, more action-oriented conclusion to the Paris story arc involving a large explosion. Ironically, this ending was also cut after the studio and Marshall decided that the film could not include an explosion after 9/11. In addition to Paris, filming took place in Prague, Imperia, Rome, Mykonos, and Zürich; several scenes set in Zürich were also filmed in Prague. Damon described the production as a struggle, citing the early conflicts that he and Liman had with the studio, but denied that it was an overtly difficult process, stating, &quot;When I hear people saying that the production was a nightmare it&#x27;s like, a &#x27;nightmare&#x27;? Shooting&#x27;s always hard, but we finished.&quot;

Liman&#x27;s directorial method was often hands-on. Many times he operated the camera himself in order to create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.

The acclaimed car chase sequence was filmed primarily by the second unit under director Alexander Witt. The unit shot in various locations around Paris while Liman was filming the main story arc elsewhere in the city. The finished footage was eventually edited together to create the illusion of a coherent journey. Liman confessed that &quot;anyone who really knows Paris will find it illogical&quot;, since few of the locations used in the car chase actually connect to each other. Liman took only a few of the shots himself; his most notable chase sequence shots were those of Matt Damon and Franka Potente while inside the car.

The consulate scenes were filmed in 2001 with real U.S. Marine Security Guards playing the roles of consulate guards.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and praised it for its ability to absorb the viewer in its &quot;spycraft&quot; and &quot;Damon&#x27;s ability to be focused and sincere&quot; concluding that the film was &quot;unnecessary, but not unskilled&quot;. A review by &quot;Film Freak Central&quot;, of the 2003 DVD release, praised the film for its pacing and action sequences, noting its &quot;subversion of the conventions of the thriller genre&quot;. Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon.com&quot; acclaimed the film as &quot;entertaining, handsome and gripping... an anomaly among big-budget summer blockbusters: a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle&quot;, without sliding into &quot;cynicism or hopelessness&quot;.

Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; also noted Doug Liman&#x27;s &quot;restrained approach to the material&quot; as well as Matt Damon and Franka Potente&#x27;s strong chemistry, but ultimately concluded the film was &quot;smart, but not smart enough&quot;. J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; dismissed the film as &quot;banal&quot; and as a disappointment compared against Liman&#x27;s previous indie releases; Owen Gleiberman also criticised the film for a &quot;sullen roteness that all of Liman&#x27;s supple handheld staging can&#x27;t disguise&quot;.
Aaron Beierle of &quot;DVDTalk&quot; gave particular praise to the film&#x27;s central car chase which was described as an exciting action highlight and one of the best realized in the genre.

&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; has been described by some authors as a neo-noir film.

===Box office===
&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; grossed $121.7million domestically (United States and Canada) and $92.4million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $214million, against a budget of $60million. Going into general release on June 14, 2002, it opened at No. 2 and spent its first five weeks in the Top 10 at the domestic box office.

===Accolades===

==Home media==
On January 21, 2003, Universal Pictures released &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; in the U.S. on VHS as well as on a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; DVD in two formats: widescreen and full screen. It surpassed &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; to have the highest DVD rentals, making $22.7 million. The film would hold this record for seven months until it was taken by &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; in August of the same year. This DVD release contains supplemental materials including a making-of documentary, a commentary from director Doug Liman and deleted scenes. On July 13, 2004, Universal released a new &quot;extended edition&quot; DVD of the film in the U.S. in preparation for the sequel&#x27;s cinema debut. This DVD came in the same two formats as the 2003 edition. The supplemental materials for this version include interviews with Matt Damon, deleted scenes, alternative opening and ending, a documentary on the consulate fight and information features on the CIA and amnesia. The alternate ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbott standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA. Neither contain the commentary or DTS tracks present in the 2003 edition. The film was also released on UMD for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Portable on August 30, 2005 and on HD DVD on July 24, 2007. With the release of &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; on DVD, a reprint of the 2004 version was included in a boxed set with &quot;Supremacy&quot; and &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, entitled &quot;The Jason Bourne Collection&quot;. A trilogy set was released on Blu-ray in January 2009.

It was the top DVD video rental in the United States during the first quarter of 2003, earning in US DVD rental revenue by March 2003.

==Soundtrack==
The score for &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; was composed by John Powell. Powell was brought in to replace Carter Burwell, who had composed and recorded a more traditional orchestral score for the film, which director Doug Liman rejected. Since a lot of the music budget had been spent recording the rejected score, Powell&#x27;s score was initially conceived to be entirely non-orchestral, making extensive use of percussion, guitars, electronics and studio techniques. However, a string section was later overdubbed onto many of the cues to give them a &#x27;cinematic&#x27; quality.

The Bourne Identity: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on June 11, 2002 by Varèse Sarabande. In addition to the score, the film also featured the songs &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; by Moby and &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; by Paul Oakenfold. The soundtrack won an ASCAP Award.

==Sequels==
&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; was followed by a 2004 sequel, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, which received a similar positive critical and public reception, but received some criticism for its hand-held camerawork, which observers argued made action sequences difficult to see. &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; was directed by Paul Greengrass with Matt Damon reprising his role as Jason Bourne. A third film, &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, was released in 2007 and again was directed by Paul Greengrass and starred Matt Damon. Like &quot;Supremacy&quot;, &quot;Ultimatum&quot; received generally positive critical and public reception, but also received similar criticism for the camera-work. Liman remained as executive producer for both films as well as for the fifth film &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, once again directed by Greengrass and released in 2016.

The fourth film of the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise, &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; was released in 2012. Neither Damon nor Greengrass was involved.

Damon and Paul Greengrass returned in 2016 for the fifth installment of the series &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, directed by Greengrass and written by Greengrass and Christopher Rouse. It is the final film in the &quot;Bourne&quot; film series and a direct sequel to &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007).

<text>Messier 56 (also known as M56 or NGC 6779) is a globular cluster in the constellation Lyra. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1779. It is angularly found about midway between Albireo (Beta (β) Cygni) and Sulafat (Gamma (γ) Lyrae). In a good night sky it is tricky to find with large (50–80 mm) binoculars, appearing as a slightly fuzzy star. The cluster can be resolved using a telescope with an aperture of or larger.

M56 is about 32,900 light-years away from Earth and measures roughly 84 light-years across, containing 230,000 solar masses (). It is about from the Galactic Center and above the galactic plane. This cluster has an estimated age of 13.70 billion years and is following a retrograde orbit through the Milky Way. The properties of this cluster suggest that it may have been acquired during the merger of a dwarf galaxy, of which Omega Centauri forms the surviving nucleus. For Messier 56, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, has a very low value of [Fe/H] = –2.00 dex which is of the abundance in the Sun.

The brightest stars in M56 are of 13th magnitude, while it contains only about a dozen known variable stars, such as V6 (RV Tauri star; period: 90 days) or V1 (Cepheid: 1.510 days); other variable stars are V2 (irregular) and V3 (semiregular). In 2000, a diffuse X-ray emission was tentatively identified coming from the vicinity of the cluster. This is most likely interstellar medium that has been heated by the passage of the cluster through the galactic halo. The relative velocity of the cluster is about 177 km s−1, which is sufficient to heat the medium in its wake to a temperature of 940,000 K.

M56 is part of the Gaia Sausage, the hypothesised remains of a merged dwarf galaxy.

<text>Caerphilly District Miners’ Hospital () was a community hospital in Caerphilly, Wales. It was managed by the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.

==History==
The hospital was established in a private house known as &quot;The Beeches&quot; which was acquired from Frederick Piggott, a mining contractor. It was commissioned to provide healthcare to the miners, who worked in the local pits, and their families. The hospital received its first patient on 2 July 1923. In the 1940s the hospital broadened its services to the whole community rather than just miners and their families. In 1945 the Hospital Board acquired Redbrook House, another large property, and converted it into a nurses&#x27; home. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948.

After services transferred to Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr at Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly District Miners Hospital closed in November 2011. The site was subsequently redeveloped for housing and the main hospital building converted into a community centre.

<text>Diana Swain is a public speaker and the founder of Diana Swain Strategies, an Executive Coaching and Communications Consulting firm based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Swain established the firm in January, 2024 after a career as a Canadian journalist.

Swain worked at CBC News, Canada’s public broadcaster, for over 33 years before deciding to leave in December, 2023 to start her own business. In her final role as Managing Editor of Investigations, she was responsible for management oversight of the network’s main investigative properties, including &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, Marketplace, Go Public and the network news investigative unit.

Prior to that, she was the Executive Producer of &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; for two seasons from 2021-2023. In her first season in that role, the program won the Canadian Screen Award for Best News or Information Series. It was nominated again for the award the following year, but did not win.

From 2019-2021, Swain was the Senior Investigative Editor for the Investigative Unit, which provided investigative news stories to all network platforms, including television, radio and online news.

Swain had previously held simultaneous on-air roles at the public broadcaster. From 2010-2019 she was the network’s Senior Investigative Correspondent reporting regularly for the network’s flagship news program, The National. She often routinely filled in as anchor on the program for long-time news host, Peter Mansbridge.

Swain often hosted CBC News Network programs. She also produced and hosted her own weekly program, The Investigators with Diana Swain which aired on the main CBC network and its 24-hour cable news station, CBC News Network. The program ran from 2016-2019.

==Early life and career==

Swain was born in Thompson, Manitoba. Her parents separated when she was young and she moved with her mother and younger sister to Chilliwack, British Columbia where she graduated from high school in 1983. In 1984, she represented Chilliwack in the Miss Canada pageant. She worked for a weekly magazine in Chilliwack for ten months and as a reporter at both the &quot;Chilliwack Progress&quot; and the radio station CHWK, before moving on to a radio station in Kamloops, British Columbia and then a radio station newsroom in Prince George, British Columbia. She began reading the news for CKPG-TV in Prince George in 1986.

==Winnipeg==

Swain first entered Winnipeg television as co-anchor of the evening newscast on independent station CKND in 1988. She co-anchored the newscast with her father Brian Swain.

Swain joined CBC&#x27;s Winnipeg station CBWT in 1990. She started as a reporter for the local news program &quot;24 Hours&quot; and quickly became a national reporter. She covered Manitoba and Saskatchewan for The National before becoming anchor of &quot;24 Hours&quot;. In 2000, Swain&#x27;s work on &quot;24 Hours&quot; was recognized when she won the first of three Gemini Awards for Best News Anchor.

In 2000, she anchored the Winnipeg portion of CBC&#x27;s &quot;Canada Now&quot; before leaving for the investigative program &quot;Disclosure&quot;.

==Toronto==

Initially, Swain commuted to Toronto from Winnipeg while working on &quot;Disclosure&quot;, but in 2003, she and her family moved to Oakville, Ontario. A year later, &quot;Disclosure&quot; was cancelled, and Swain became the host of &quot;CBC News Toronto.&quot; Since then, she frequently substituted for Peter Mansbridge as anchor of CBC&#x27;s flagship news show, &quot;The National&quot;.

On August 6, 2010, she stepped down as anchor of &quot;CBC News Toronto&quot; to move to the CBC News Investigative unit, where she became Senior Investigative Correspondent and makes frequent reports on &quot;The National&quot;. In 2014, she became an anchor on CBC News Network. In 2016, she began hosting a new program, &quot;The Investigators with Diana Swain&quot; which looks at the work of investigative journalists and the challenges and ethical questions they face in their work. She also reports on CBC Radio and can be seen on cbcnews.ca.

Swain was chosen to be one of CBC’s lead hosts for the Olympics in Beijing in 2008. She was paired with sports host Scott Russell.

Swain reprised the role with sports host David Amber in Sochi, Russia in 2014. She covered the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, Korea for the CBC News department as a reporter.

Swain was given the alumni of the year award from her alma mater BCIT in 2006, recognizing her achievements in the news industry. She received an honorary degree from Humber College in June, 2010.

In 2017, she received an honorary doctorate in technology from BCIT, and gave the convocation speech 30 years after her own graduation from the school&#x27;s journalism program.

After 30 years with the CBC, she retired from the network in January 2024 to launch her own consulting business.

== Personal life ==
Diana Swain married Television Technical Producer Eric Milotzki in May, 2024. The two met while working at CBC. Swain has two adult children from her first marriage. She was previously married to Ron Kuipers and divorced in 2014.

<text>Messier 58 (also known as &quot;M58&quot; and &quot;NGC 4579&quot;) is an intermediate barred spiral galaxy with a weak inner ring structure located within the constellation Virgo, approximately 68 million light-years away from Earth. It was discovered by Charles Messier on April 15, 1779 and is one of four barred spiral galaxies that appear in Messier&#x27;s catalogue. M58 is one of the brightest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. From 1779 it was arguably (though unknown at that time) the farthest known astronomical object until the release of the New General Catalogue in the 1880s and even more so the publishing of redshift values in the 1920s.

==Early observations==
Charles Messier discovered Messier 58, along with the elliptical galaxies Messier 59 and Messier 60, on April 15, 1779. M58 was reported on the chart of the Comet of 1779 as it was almost on the same parallel as the star Epsilon Virginis. Messier described M58 as a very faint nebula in Virgo which would disappear in the slightest amount of light he used to illuminate the micrometer wires. This description was later contradicted by John Herschel&#x27;s observations in 1833 where he described it as a very bright galaxy, especially towards the middle. Herschel&#x27;s observations were also similar to the descriptions of both John Dreyer and William Henry Smyth who said that M58 was a bright galaxy, mottled, irregularly round and very much brighter toward the middle.

==Characteristics==
Like many other spiral galaxies of the Virgo Cluster (e.g. Messier 90), Messier 58 is an anemic galaxy with low star formation activity concentrated within the galaxy&#x27;s optical disk, and relatively little neutral hydrogen, also located inside its disk, concentrated in clumps, compared with other galaxies of similar morphological type. This deficiency of gas is believed to be caused by interactions with Virgo&#x27;s intracluster medium.

Messier 58 has a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, where a starburst may be present as well as a supermassive black hole with a mass of around 70 million solar masses. It is also one of the very few galaxies known to possess a UCNR (&quot;ultra-compact nuclear ring&quot;), a series of star-forming regions located in a very small ring around the center of the galaxy. This led to its being dubbed the &quot;ring bearer galaxy&quot; by the popular astronomy YouTube program &quot;Deep Sky videos&quot;.

==Supernovae==
Two supernovae have been observed in the M58 galaxy:
* SN 1988A (type II, mag. 13.5) was discovered by Kaoru Ikeya, Robert Evans, Christian Pollas and Shingo Horiguchi on January 18, 1988. It was found 40 arcseconds south of the galaxy center.
* SN 1989M (Type Ia, mag. 12.2) was discovered by Givi N. Kimeridze on 28 June 1989. It was found 33 arcseconds north and 44 arcseconds west of M58&#x27;s nucleus.

<text>Robert Cortez Scott (born April 30, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 1993. A member of the Democratic Party, he is the dean of Virginia&#x27;s congressional delegation and the first Filipino American voting member of Congress. The district serves most of the majority-black precincts of Hampton Roads, including all of the independent cities of Norfolk, Newport News (where he resides), Hampton and Portsmouth, and parts of the independent city of Chesapeake. From 2019 to 2023, Scott was chair of the House Education and Labor Committee. He has been ranking member on that committee since 2023.

==Early life, education and legal career==
Scott was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Newport News, Virginia. He is of African American and Filipino descent. His father, Charles Waldo Scott, was a pioneering African American surgeon. and in 1952 became the first African American appointed to the Newport News school board in the 20th century. Scott&#x27;s mother Mae Hamlin-Scott, a graduate in chemistry of the University of Michigan, was an educator who taught science in the Newport News public schools.

Scott graduated from Groton School in 1965. He received his B.A. in government from Harvard College in 1969 and his Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School in 1973. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was a lawyer in private practice in Newport News from 1973 to 1991.

Scott is an Episcopalian.

=== Military service ===
Scott is a former member of the Massachusetts Army National Guard (1970–73) and Army Reserve (1974–76).

==Virginia legislature==
Scott was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates as a Democrat in 1977 and to the Senate of Virginia in 1982, after a census-based reapportionment changed district numbers (thus, his nominal predecessors were in fact representatives from Northern Virginia). In the Virginia legislature, Scott worked to allow the poor and children greater access to health care, as well as to increase the minimum wage, and increase job training. He also authored legislation providing tax credits to business that provide donations to serving local communities in preventing crime or improving social service delivery.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

;1986
Scott first ran for Congress in 1986 in the , which included his home in Newport News. He lost to Republican incumbent Herb Bateman, 56%-44%.

;1992
In 1992, the Department of Justice directed the Virginia legislature to draw a black-majority district after the 1990 census. The legislature responded by shifting most of the black residents of Hampton Roads and Richmond into a newly created 3rd district. Scott won a three-way Democratic primary with 67% of the vote, which was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. In the general election, he defeated Republican Dan Jenkins 79%-21%.

;1994-2008
During this period, Scott was reelected every two years with at least 76% of the vote, except in 2004. That year, he was challenged by Republican Winsome Sears, a former State Delegate. He won with 69% of the vote, now the second-lowest winning percentage of his career. In 1994, Scott won 79.44% of the vote, defeating Republican Thomas E. Ward. In 1996, he won 82.12% of the vote, defeating Republican Eisle G. Holland. In 1998, he won 75.97% of the vote, defeating Independent Robert S. Barnett. He ran unopposed in 2000, 2002, 2006, and 2008.

Scott defeated Republican Chuck Smith, a former JAG, 70%-27%.

;2012

After redistricting, Scott&#x27;s district was made even safer; he picked up all of Portsmouth and Newport News, as well as Petersburg. In 2008, President Barack Obama had carried the district with 76% of the vote; Scott won the new district with 78%, defeating Air Force officer Dean Longo. He easily won an 11th term with 81.26% of the vote.

Scott joined Obama in kicking off his campaign at Virginia Commonwealth University. The focus of the rally was largely on Obama&#x27;s timeline for leaving the Middle East.

;2016

The 3rd was reconfigured as a result of a court-ordered redistricting in 2015. It lost its territory in and around Richmond to the neighboring 4th district, but the new 3rd was no less Democratic than its predecessor.

Scott defeated Republican Marty Williams, 66%-33%, the lowest winning percentage of his career.

===Tenure===
Scott is the first African American Representative from Virginia since Reconstruction. Also, having a maternal grandfather of Filipino ancestry makes Scott the first American of Filipino descent to serve as a voting member of Congress. His congressional district is the only one with a majority black population in Virginia. It was created in 1992 and has remained the state&#x27;s most Democratic district.

Scott&#x27;s annual Labor Day picnic, usually held at his mother&#x27;s residence in Newport News, is a major campaign stop for statewide and federal candidates in Virginia.

In 1997, Scott was one of two votes against the creation of a national registry for crimes against children and sexually violent offenders.

On November 7, 2009, Scott voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act (HR 3962).

Scott has voted progressively in the House. He has supported increases in the minimum wage and has worked to eliminate anti-gay bias in the workplace. In 2010, Scott co-sponsored the &quot;Lee-Scott bill&quot; with Barbara Lee to make it easier on individuals who had been on unemployment for 99 weeks without finding work. Of the bill, Lee said, &quot;it is important that we put in place a safety net for those still looking for work. We cannot and will not allow our fellow Americans to fall by the wayside. Congressman Scott and I plan to continue to push for passage of this legislation because it is simply the right thing to do.&quot;
Scott supports LGBT rights. In 2009, he voted in favor of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a bill that expanded the federal hate crime law to cover crimes biased by the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2010, he voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act. In 2019, Scott voted in favor of the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and urged Congress members to support the legislation.

Scott was an outspoken opponent of the Bush administration. He opposed the Patriot Act, explaining that officials could abuse their power by promoting anti-terrorist security and develop unfair &quot;racial profiling&quot;. In 2002 Scott voted against the Iraq war resolution and did not support any of the Bush Doctrine in reference to the Iraq war.

For his tenure as the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee in the 116th Congress, Scott earned an &quot;A&quot; grade from the nonpartisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

Scott was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

Scott voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

Scott was one of two Democrats along with Nikema Williams who voted against the expulsion of former New York representative George Santos.

===Legislation sponsored===
Scott introduced the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1447; 113th Congress) on April 9, 2013. The bill would require the United States Department of Justice to collect data from U.S. states and territories about the deaths of prisoners in their custody. States and territories would face monetary penalties for noncompliance. It would also require federal agencies to report on the deaths of prisoners in their custody.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Education and Labor (ranking member)

===Caucuses===
* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus
* Congressional Black Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Congressional Cement Caucus
*Climate Solutions Caucus
*Medicare for All Caucus

===U.S. Senate speculation===
When then-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton selected Tim Kaine, a U.S. Senator from Virginia, as her running mate in July 2016, speculation arose about who would be nominated to replace Kaine in the Senate should the ticket win. In August 2016, former Democratic Governor of Virginia Douglas Wilder stated that he would want Governor Terry McAuliffe to appoint Scott to the seat, stating that it &quot;would be good for the commonwealth, good for the Democratic Party, of which Bobby has been most supportive, and great for our nation.&quot; On November 8, Clinton and Kaine lost the election and Kaine remained in his Senate seat.

=== Controversies ===
====2017 sexual harassment allegation====
On December 15, 2017, Marsheri Everson (also known as M. Reese Everson), a former congressional fellow who had worked in Scott&#x27;s office, alleged that Scott had sexually harassed her in 2013, touching her on the knee and back on separate occasions, then propositioning her with an inappropriate relationship after asking, &quot;if you travel with me, are you going to be good?&quot; Scott strongly denied Everson&#x27;s claim.

Everson was represented by two attorneys, one Jack Burkman, known for his involvement in the conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich as well as his alleged involvement in a scheme to pay women to lie about sexual harassment claims against special counsel and former FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Everson&#x27;s case against Scott was mutually dismissed in 2021.

====Knowledge of sexual assault allegations against Justin Fairfax====
Scripps professor Vanessa C. Tyson alleged in 2019 that Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her in 2004 and approached Scott, a longtime friend, about these allegations between the time of Fairfax&#x27;s election in November 2017 and inauguration in January 2018; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also contacted Scott about the allegations. In a 2019 statement, Scott said, &quot;Allegations of sexual assault need to be taken seriously. I have known Professor Tyson for approximately a decade and she is a friend. She deserves the opportunity to have her story heard.&quot;

<doc id="964022" wikidata="Q320426" url="?curid=964022" title="Handsome Lake">
<text>Handsome Lake () (1735 – 10 August 1815) was a Seneca religious leader of the Iroquois people. He was a half-brother to Cornplanter (), a Seneca war chief.

Handsome Lake, a leader and prophet, played a major role in reviving traditional religion among the Haudenosaunee (People of the Longhouse), or Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy. He preached a message that combined traditional Haudenosaunee religious beliefs with a revised code meant to revive traditional consciousness to the Haudenosaunee after a long period of cultural disintegration following colonization. This message was eventually published as the &quot;Code of Handsome Lake&quot; and is still practiced today.

==Name==
Handsome Lake&#x27;s name is transcribed differently in the languages of the Six Nations: Cayuga language: ; Oneida language: ; Mohawk language: ; Tuscarora language: ; historically recorded also as &quot;Ganioda&#x27;yo&quot;, &quot;Ganiodaio&quot;, &quot;Conudiu&quot;, &quot;Conudiu&quot;, &quot;Ga-Nyah-Di-Yoh&quot;, and &quot;Kaniatario&quot;.

==Early life==
Handsome Lake was born as Hadawa&#x27;ko (&quot;Shaking Snow&quot;) around 1735 in the Seneca village of Canawaugus, on the Genesee River near present-day Avon, New York. Very little is known of his parents; his mother, Gahonnoneh, later had an affair with a Dutch fur trader and gunsmith, resulting in the birth of Handsome Lake&#x27;s half-brother, Cornplanter. Handsome Lake was born into the Wolf clan of his mother, as the Iroquois have a matrilineal kinship system. Born during a time when the Seneca nation was at its peak of prosperity through fur trading, Handsome Lake witnessed the gradual deterioration of his society. Other well-known relatives in Handsome Lake&#x27;s family included Governor Blacksnake (), Red Jacket (), and Half-Town.

==Career==
In 1794 he signed the U.S. treaty with the Six Nations (known as the Pickering Treaty). He visited Washington, D.C., with Cornplanter in 1802.

===Tribe===
Several factors contributed to the erosion of morale and spiritual welfare of the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee. At its peak in the early 18th century, the Haudenosaunee controlled much of what is now the midwestern United States, which it had conquered through decades of warring against the tribes native to those areas in the Beaver Wars.

In 1779, Handsome Lake wanted to die after the US military attacked the Haudenosaunee villages, wiping out whole communities and killing many. In his despair, Handsome Lake was said to had envisioned a visit by the Three Sisters-the spirits of the corn, beans, and squash. The Three Sisters&#x27; visit prompted Handsome Lake to return to and re-teach his community its traditional agricultural practices.

After the American Revolution, the Haudenosaunee lost most of their land in New York and Pennsylvania and were forced to live on reservations, including in Canada, as punishment for taking the side of the British Crown in the revolution. Although these reservations included much of the prime real estate in Western New York, including several of the prominent creek and river valleys, the small and fragmented native lands were separated by wide swaths of land that was eventually earmarked for American settlement in what would be known as the Holland Purchase. This dislocation followed years of social disruption due to epidemics of infectious disease and major wars.

Alcohol was introduced to the tribes in this time frame, a substance to which numerous Haudenosaunee (including Handsome Lake himself) began consuming in excess, exacerbating the erosion of the traditional family unit. This situation was a result of the cultural clash between the fledgling United States and the once equally powerful Six Nations people. The traditional religious rituals were no longer applicable to the environment in which the Haudenosaunee people found themselves.

==Brings a Message of Gaihwi:io (&quot;Good Word&quot;)==
In 1799, after a period of illness due to many years of excessive alcoholism, Handsome Lake had the visions that gave him the power to become a prophet. In his vision, he was warned by three spiritual messengers, , who presented him with ideals that he must enforce among his people. They told him of concerns he must enforce, like learning the English language and preservation of their land. Shortly after Handsome Lake&#x27;s first vision, he ceased drinking alcohol. When he regained his health, he began bringing a message of Gaihwi:io (or Kaliwihyo) (the &quot;Good Word&quot;) to his people. He preached against drunkenness and other evil practices. His message outlined a moral code that was eventually referred to as the Code of Handsome Lake. Today it is called the Longhouse Religion.

Handsome Lake abolished societal sins, attempting to cleanse the tribes of all immoral actions. He threatened his people in order to show them the error of their ways. He insisted that Iroquois people must refrain from drinking, marital abuse, abortion, spouse and child abandonment, selling of land, overconsumption, intensive animal farming, and witchcraft.

The rise of Handsome Lake&#x27;s Way of Life was more successful than most religions during that time because his code combined traditional Iroquois way of life with Quaker values. Despite the clear presence of Christian values in his teachings, it is unclear how much contact with Christianity Handsome Lake had previous to his visions. His way of life stressed survival without the sacrifice of the Iroquois identity, and recognized the need to make adjustments in order to survive in their changing world. Handsome Lake&#x27;s ideals were eye opening and majority of people agreed with him. Those who opposed the code had reasons to believe that Handsome Lake was giving up on their old ways by altering the character of their way of life. They saw Handsome Lake&#x27;s new ideals as abandoning their history and forfeiting to Quaker ideals because Handsome Lake did not believe that they could survive with the world evolving around them.

Then-President Thomas Jefferson gave his endorsement to Handsome Lake&#x27;s code in 1803. With the help of Handsome Lake’s relatives, his visions were written down and published in 1850. The Code of Handsome Lake remains practiced among the Seneca and is considered to be a traditional Indian way of life. Beginning in the 1820s, it became traditional for the Code to be recited every September at Tonawanda in the Seneca Nation.

==A Tale Of How America Was Discovered==
How America Was Discovered is a story told by Handsome Lake, and documented by Arthur C. Parker, about a young minister who meets the one he perceives to be the Lord, who then asks him to go to a new land and bring with him cards, money, a fiddle, whiskey, and blood corruption. In return the young minister will become rich. The young minister sought out Christopher Columbus, and with the help of his crew, traveled to the Americas. They turned back to report what they had seen, which caused an immigration of people from Europe to the Americas. Along with the people came the five things that aided in destroying the natives. The end reveals that the &quot;Lord&quot; in the gold castle was actually the devil, and that even he knew what he had caused was wrong.

<text>Messier 59 or M59, also known as NGC 4621, is an elliptical galaxy in the equatorial constellation of Virgo. It is a member of the Virgo Cluster, with the nearest fellow member away and around 5 magnitudes fainter. The nearest cluster member of comparable brightness is the lenticular galaxy NGC 4638, which is around away. It and the angularly nearby elliptical galaxy Messier 60 were both discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779 when observing comet seeming close by. Charles Messier listed both in the Messier Catalogue about three days after Koehler&#x27;s discovery.

This is an elliptical galaxy of type E5 with a position angle of 163.3°, indicating the overall shape shows a flattening of 50%. However, isophotes for this galaxy deviate from a perfect ellipticity, showing pointed shapes instead. These can be decomposed mathematically into a three component model, with each part having a different eccentricity. The main elliptical component appears to be superimposed upon a flatter, disk-like feature, with the entirety embedded within a circular halo. The luminosity contribution of the components is 62% for the pure elliptical part, 22% for the halo, and the remainder coming from the disk. The light ratio of the disk to the main elliptical body is 0.25, whereas it is typically closer to 0.5 in a lenticular galaxy.

The core contains a supermassive black hole (SMBH), with a mass that has been estimated to be 270 million times the mass of the Sun, and counter-rotates with respect of the rest of the galaxy, being bluer. The SMBH is quiescent, but is detectable as an X-ray and radio source that indicates an outflow. The nucleus contains an embedded stellar disk that is bluer (younger) than the bulge region, with a blue component stretching along a position angle of around 150°. This extended disk feature may be the result of a galactic merger followed by a starburst event.

Messier 59 is very rich in globular clusters, with a population of them that has been estimated to be around 2,200. It has two satellites, the ultra compact dwarf galaxy M59-UCD3 and M59cO, which is a rare example of a galaxy in between compact ellipticals such as Messier 32 and ultra compact dwarfs.

== Supernova ==
One supernova has been recorded in M59: SN 1939B (type Ia, mag. 15) was discovered by Fritz Zwicky on 19 May 1939. It reached a peak magnitude of 11.9. The region where this supernova occurred shows no trace of star formation, which suggests this was a type Ia supernova.

<text>Ron Geaves (born 7 June 1948) is a British scholar of religious studies who was professor of the comparative study of religion at Liverpool Hope University in England, retiring in December 2013. He was formerly Programme Leader and Chair in religious studies at the University of Chester in England (2001-2007) and Head of Department at the University of Chichester (1999-2001). He was chair of the Muslims in Britain Research Network (2007-2010) and instrumental in the creation of BRAIS (British Association of Islamic Studies), remaining on their advisory board.

==Academic career==
His Ph.D. from the University of Leeds was on community formation amongst British Muslims (1990-1994) and he has remained interested in the history of the development of Islamic religious life in Britain throughout his career. He has become known by his expertise in the adaptation and transmigration of religions to the West, especially Islam, but also Sikhism and Hinduism and his academic championing of the study of &#x27;lived&#x27; religions. He is the author of several books, including &quot;The Sufis of Britain&quot;, which explored the manifestations of Islamic mysticism in the UK and &quot;The Continuum Glossary of Religious Terminology &quot; an extensive glossary of seven major world faiths, &quot;The Study of Religion&quot; (co-authored with George Chryssides), a key undergraduate text. Probably his most successful work has been &quot;Islam in Victorian Britain: The Life and Times of Abdullah Quilliam&quot;, generating considerable interest among both Muslims in Britain and the media.

Geaves has taught several subjects including Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, the Sociology and Anthropology of Religion, Judaism, Christianity and ancient religions. His interests lie in the spiritual manifestations of Islam and Indian traditions.

Geaves was one of the earliest Western students of Maharaji (Prem Rawat, known also as Guru Maharaj Ji). Geaves has written a number of papers related to Maharaji and his organizations, such as the Divine Light Mission, and Elan Vital.
In July 2006, as he prepared to give an inaugural lecture at the University of Chester to dignitaries and members of the Muslim community in the North West of England, he commented that the 7 July 2005 London bombings were &quot;primarily an extreme form of demonstration&quot; that had to be seen within a long history of protests by British Muslims. He also said that &quot;terrorism is a political word which always seems to be used to demonise people&quot;. Various spokespersons expressed strong disagreement with these statements.

Since retirement from full-time University employment, he has continued his research into British Muslim communities and working alongside various Islamic educators, engaged in curriculum reform. He is currently Honorary Visiting Professor in the Centre for the Study of Islam in Britain at Cardiff University.

<doc id="964034" wikidata="Q178952" url="?curid=964034" title="Argument from poor design">
<text>The argument from poor design, also known as the dysteleological argument, is an argument against the assumption of the existence of a creator God, based on the reasoning that any omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity or deities would not create organisms with the perceived suboptimal designs that occur in nature.

The argument is structured as a basic &quot;modus ponens&quot;: if &quot;creation&quot; contains many defects, then design appears an implausible theory for the origin of earthly existence. Proponents most commonly use the argument in a weaker way, however: not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; of the well-known argument from design (which suggests that living things appear too well-designed to have originated by chance, and so an intelligent God or gods must have deliberately created them).

Although the phrase &quot;argument from poor design&quot; has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as &quot;poor design&quot;, &quot;suboptimal design&quot;, &quot;unintelligent design&quot; or &quot;dysteleology/dysteleological&quot;. The nineteenth-century biologist Ernst Haeckel applied the term &quot;dysteleology&quot; to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism. In his 1868 book &quot;Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte&quot; (&quot;The History of Creation&quot;), Haeckel devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of &quot;a theory of the &quot;unsuitability of parts&quot; in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the &quot;suitability of parts&quot;&quot;. In 2005, Donald Wise of the University of Massachusetts Amherst popularised the term &quot;incompetent design&quot; (a play on &quot;intelligent design&quot;), to describe aspects of nature seen as flawed in design.

Traditional Christian theological responses generally posit that God constructed a perfect universe but that humanity&#x27;s misuse of its free will to rebel against God has resulted in the corruption of divine good design.

== Overview ==
The argument runs that:

# An omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator God would create organisms that have optimal design.
# Organisms have features that are suboptimal.
# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

It is sometimes used as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design, which runs as follows:

# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.
# Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.
# This creator is God.

&quot;Poor design&quot; is consistent with the predictions of the scientific theory of evolution by means of natural selection. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the hereditary mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.

In fitness landscape terms, natural selection will always push &quot;up the hill&quot;, but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.

The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by Charles Darwin; modern proponents have included Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Dawkins, and Nathan H. Lents. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. Theistic evolutionists generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.

== Examples ==
===In humans===
====Fatal flaws====
American scientist Nathan H. Lents published his book on poor design in the human body and genome in 2018 titled &quot;Human Errors&quot;. The book ignited a firestorm of criticism from the creationist community but was well received by the scientific community and received unanimously favorable reviews in the dozens of non-creationist media outlets that covered it.

Several defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care:
* In the human female, a fertilized egg can implant into the fallopian tube, cervix or ovary rather than the uterus causing an ectopic pregnancy. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother.
* In the human female, the birth canal passes through the pelvis. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the baby&#x27;s head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery (caesarean section), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby, or both. Other birthing complications such as breech birth are worsened by this position of the birth canal.
* In the human male, testes develop initially within the abdomen. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the scrotum. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where hernias can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, such as intestinal blockage and gangrene, usually resulted in death.
* The existence of the pharynx, a passage used for both ingestion and respiration, with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of choking. 
* The breathing reflex is stimulated not directly by the absence of oxygen but indirectly by the presence of carbon dioxide. This means that high concentrations of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, can cause suffocation without any biological warning. Furthermore, at high altitudes, oxygen deprivation can occur in unadapted individuals who do not consciously increase their breathing rate.
* The human appendix is a vestigial organ thought to serve no purpose. Appendicitis, an infection of this organ, is a certain death without medical intervention. &quot;During the past few years, however, several studies have suggested its immunological importance for the development and preservation of the intestinal immune system.&quot;
* Tinnitus, a phantom auditory sensation, is a maladaptation resulting from hearing loss most often caused by exposure to loud noise. Tinnitus serves no practical purpose, reduces quality of life, may cause depression, and when severe can lead to suicide.

====Other flaws====

* Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the plantaris muscle of the foot, that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case.
* The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to scoliosis, sciatica and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae. The spinal cord cannot ever properly heal if it is damaged, because neurons have become so specialized that they are no longer able to regrow once they reach their mature state. The spinal cord, if broken, will never repair itself and will result in permanent paralysis.
* The route of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the aortic arch. This same configuration holds true for many animals; in the case of the giraffe, this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve.
* Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin C, but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective (Pseudogene ΨGULO). Lack of vitamin C results in scurvy and eventually death. The gene is also non-functional in other primates and in guinea pigs, but is functional in most other animals.
* The prevalence of congenital diseases and genetic disorders such as Huntington&#x27;s disease.
* The male urethra passes directly through the prostate, which can produce urinary difficulties if the prostate becomes swollen.
* Crowded teeth and poor sinus drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other primates although humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with wisdom teeth, which can damage neighboring teeth or cause serious infections of the mouth.
* The structure of human eyes (as well as those of all vertebrates). The retina is &#x27;inside out&#x27;. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the &quot;surface&quot; of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many invertebrate species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a blind spot. Having the optic nerve connected to the side of the retina that does not receive the light, as is the case in cephalopods, would avoid these problems. Lents and colleagues have proposed that the tapetum lucidum, the reflective surface behind vertebrate retinas, has evolved to overcome the limitations of the inverted retina, as cephalopods have never evolved this structure. However, an &#x27;inverted&#x27; retina actually improves image quality through müller cells by reducing distortion. The effects of the blind spots resulting from the inverted retina are cancelled by binocular vision, as the blind spots in both eyes are oppositely angled. Additionally, as cephalopod eyes lack cone cells and might be able to judge color by bringing specific wavelengths to a focus on the retina, an inverted retina might interfere with this mechanism.
* Humans are attracted to junk food&#x27;s non-nutritious ingredients, and even wholly non-nutritious psychoactive drugs, and can experience physiological adaptations to prefer them to nutrients.

===Other life===

* In the African locust, nerve cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials.
* Intricate reproductive devices in orchids, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers.
* The use by pandas of their enlarged radial sesamoid bones in a manner similar to how other creatures use thumbs.
* The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches.
* The enzyme RuBisCO has been described as a &quot;notoriously inefficient&quot; enzyme, as it is inhibited by oxygen, has a very slow turnover and is not saturated at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The enzyme is inhibited as it is unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, with oxygen acting as a competitive enzyme inhibitor. However, RuBisCO remains the key enzyme in carbon fixation, and plants overcome its poor activity by having massive amounts of it inside their cells, making it the most abundant protein on Earth.
* Sturdy but heavy bones, suited for non-flight, occurring in animals like bats. Or, on the converse: unstable, light, hollow bones, suited for flight, occurring in birds like penguins and ostriches, which cannot fly.
* Various vestigial body parts, like the femur and pelvis in whales (evolution indicates the ancestors of whales lived on land).
* &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot; and species of the genus &quot;Hydra&quot; have biological immortality, but most animals do not.
* Many species have strong instincts to behave in response to a certain stimulus. Natural selection can leave animals behaving in detrimental ways when they encounter a supernormal stimulus - like a moth flying into a flame.
* Plants are green and not black, as chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly, even though black plants would absorb more light energy.
* Whales and dolphins breathe air, but live in the water, meaning they must swim to the surface frequently to breathe.
* Albatrosses cannot take off or land properly.

==Counterarguments==
===Specific examples===
Intelligent design proponent William Dembski questions the first premise of the argument, claiming that &quot;intelligent design&quot; does not need to be optimal.

While the appendix has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms. In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions.

===Responses to counterarguments===
In response to the claim that uses have been found for &quot;junk&quot; DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include pseudogenes that are nonfunctional &quot;junk&quot;, with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question. The original study that suggested that the &quot;Makorin1-p1&quot; served some purpose has been disputed. However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.

==As an argument regarding God==
The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an argument against the existence of God, or against characteristics commonly attributed to a creator deity, such as omnipotence, omniscience, or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of &quot;poor design&quot; (as well as the perceived prodigious &quot;wastefulness&quot; of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a &quot;poor&quot; designer, or a &quot;blind&quot; designer, or no designer at all. In Gould&#x27;s words, &quot;If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged...&quot;

The apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by proponents of theistic evolution to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses natural selection as a mechanism of his creation. Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a false dilemma, imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of intelligent design to cherry pick which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the unfalsifiability of the theory. Christian proponents of both intelligent design and creationism may claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of free will that caused the fall of man (for example, in Genesis 3:16 Yahweh says to Eve &quot;I will increase your trouble in pregnancy&quot;).

<text>Donald Eugene Webb (born Donald Eugene Perkins; July 14, 1931 – December 30, 1999) was an American career criminal wanted for attempted burglary and the murder of police chief Gregory Adams in the small town of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania on December 4, 1980. It was only the second murder in the town&#x27;s nearly 150-year history; the first murder occurred in 1842.

Webb was a fugitive featured on the FBI&#x27;s 10 Most Wanted List until 2007, setting a record in 1999 for longest stay on the list, but was never apprehended. In 2010, his record on that list was superseded by another criminal; Víctor Manuel Gerena. The murder of Police Chief Adams was never solved by prosecution of the criminal; it was the longest-running cold case of a police officer in the United States. In July 2017, Webb&#x27;s remains were discovered in Massachusetts on the property of his wife Lillian Webb. She had hidden him in two of her homes for 17 years, until he died of a stroke in 1999.

== Background and family ==
Donald Eugene Perkins was born in Oklahoma City in 1931. He was raised by his paternal grandfather. Perkins enlisted in the United States Navy, but received a dishonorable discharge.

Perkins legally changed his name to Webb in 1956 in Bristol County, Massachusetts.

Webb worked as a butcher, salesman, restaurant manager, and vending machine repairman. Before 1979, Webb spent extended periods in the Southwest, New England, and on the West Coast. After Webb&#x27;s disappearance in 1980, his relatives and criminal associates consistently refused to cooperate with investigators.

Webb had married Lillian and they had a son together. In 1981, Webb&#x27;s wife Lillian lived in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts. She worked as a saleswoman for a now-defunct New Bedford box company. In 1999, it was reported that Lillian, her son, and other relatives of Donald Webb were living in the Boston area.

== Criminal career ==
Webb had convictions for burglary, possession of counterfeit money, possession of a weapon and dangerous instruments, breaking and entering, armed bank robbery, grand larceny and car theft. In the mid-1970s, Webb served a two-year prison term in New York state prison.

The FBI has considered Webb &quot;a master of assumed identities&quot;. New York and Pennsylvania police have described Webb as &quot;an itinerant burglar well versed in the art of criminal impersonation&quot;. Webb was identified by the FBI as an associate of the Patriarca crime family, who made a living robbing banks, jewelry stores, and high-end hotels up and down the East Coast. They fenced the goods through &quot;the mob&quot; in Providence, Rhode Island. He was also involved with an organized crime outfit in the Miami area, where he would also fence the goods.

In 1979, Webb and two accomplices allegedly burgled suburban Albany homes while posing as sewer and water inspectors. Webb and Frank Joseph Lach, one of the accomplices, were arrested in Colonie, New York. They were charged with attempted burglary, but after their bails were posted (bail of Webb was $35,000), they failed to appear at a December 1979 court date.

=== Frank Lach ===
Frank Joseph Lach (November 23, 1940 - November 4, 2017), was closely associated with Webb. Lach is from Cranston, Rhode Island and was believed to be involved with a Massachusetts-based gang responsible for a number of jewel thefts from residences and businesses in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as having ties to organized crime in New England and South Florida.

Although the last known connection of Webb and Lach was in Allentown, Pennsylvania in July 1980, Lach was believed to be with Webb when he killed Police Chief Gregory Adams in December 1980 in Saxonburg. (See below)

Lach was subsequently wanted by the FBI for interstate flight from justice; he was captured in South Miami, Florida in May 1982. He was extradited to New York, where he was convicted of burglary and bail-jumping. He was paroled in November 1985. In February 1986, he was convicted by a federal jury of conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, and of driving under the influence and parole violation in June 1996. Lach served time in federal prison and was released in October 2000. Lach passed away on November 4, 2017, at his house in Cranston, Rhode Island just 19 days before his 77th birthday.

== Murder of Gregory Adams ==

On December 4, 1980, Gregory B. Adams, a 31-year-old police chief of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, and nine-year veteran of law enforcement, made a routine traffic stop in the parking lot of Agway Feed Store on Butler Street. Adams used his patrol car to stop the suspect by blocking the exit of the parking lot. When he asked the suspect for his driver&#x27;s license, the suspect gave fraudulent identity documents then shot Adams. Officer Adams returned fire, but the shots were not fatal.

The man believed to be Donald Eugene Webb got out of the car and fought with Adams, disarming him and pistol-whipping him with his own revolver. Witnesses heard fired shots; four &quot;pop&quot; noises, presumably from a semiautomatic .25-caliber Colt pistol, and a &quot;boom&quot; from Adams&#x27; revolver. He was shot once in the arm and once in the chest at close range. By another account, Adams was shot twice in the chest, one bullet collapsing a lung and another tearing through the bottom of his heart. Adams was not wearing his bulletproof vest at the time. The killer took Adams&#x27; gun, ran to his patrol car, ripped out its microphone and took the keys before driving away in his own car.

A nearby resident found the mortally wounded Adams, who told her that he did not know his attacker and that he knew he was not going to make it. In addition to being shot, Adams was so badly beaten he was almost unrecognizable. Adams lost consciousness on the way to the hospital and died of his injuries. He was survived by his wife Mary Ann Adams and their two sons, Benjamin and Gregory, Jr. Adams is buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Herman, Pennsylvania.

== Investigation ==
A .25-caliber Colt pistol, O-type blood (Webb&#x27;s blood type), and a New Jersey driver&#x27;s license bearing the name Stanley John Portas, an alias of Webb and the name of his wife Lillian&#x27;s late prior husband, were among the evidence found at the murder scene. Portas had died in 1948. Webb is believed to have been in Saxonburg for a planned burglary of a jewelry store. Adams&#x27; revolver was later found approximately away along Cornplanter Road in Winfield Township, Pennsylvania. All six bullets of the weapon had been fired.

A white Mercury Cougar, which Webb had rented, was allegedly used as a getaway car. Two weeks later, it was found abandoned at a Howard Johnson&#x27;s motel in Warwick, Rhode Island. Significant amounts of O-type blood were found under the steering wheel, suggesting that Webb was wounded by gunfire in the struggle with Adams.

Webb was named as a main suspect in the killing of Adams, and a nationwide manhunt began. He was charged &quot;in absentia&quot; with murder, attempted burglary, and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. A federal arrest warrant was issued for him on December 31. On May 4, 1981, Webb was named as the 375th fugitive to be placed on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted list.

Webb had strong ties to Fall River and New Bedford, Massachusetts, where the last confirmed sighting of him was made by an anonymous tipster in July 1981. It was reported to the Boston FBI office, but Webb had fled by the time investigators arrived. There were later unconfirmed sightings of Webb, or men resembling him, in Massachusetts, Washington, Canada and Costa Rica.

In January 1990, FBI director William S. Sessions received a letter postmarked January 23 and written by someone claiming to be Webb, asking for forgiveness from Adams&#x27; family. The letter suggested he might surrender to authorities, but only if he could talk directly to John Walsh, host of the TV show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. Walsh said on his show that the FBI&#x27;s evidence technicians examined the letter and believed it was authentic. Handwriting tests were inconclusive. On April 1, 1990, a man claiming to be Webb called John Walsh but when asked questions to confirm his identity, was unable to name two of Webb&#x27;s closest relatives. The call was dismissed as an April Fools&#x27; joke. The murder case was featured in an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.

After more than 18 years on the list, on September 14, 1999, Webb was noted as the fugitive with the longest tenure on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list, surpassing the previous record held by Charles Lee Herron.

In April 2005, an unidentified man in Detroit was found using Webb&#x27;s name, age and Social Security number. Detroit police tracked the address to a burned-out house in a poor section of town. Authorities considered this a case of identity theft, however unusual.

The FBI removed Webb from the Ten Most Wanted list on March 31, 2007. He was replaced by Shauntay Henderson. Webb held the record of being on the FBI&#x27;s wanted list longer than any other fugitive until 2010, when Víctor Manuel Gerena surpassed his record. Although Webb was still a fugitive considered armed and dangerous by the FBI, the significant lack of leads made some investigators believe Webb had died.

On December 4, 2015, the FBI increased their reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Webb, or to the location of his remains. Key investigators, including the FBI special agent assigned to finding Webb, believed he was still alive.

On June 1, 2017, Mary Ann Adams Jones, the police chief&#x27;s widow (who had remarried), filed a lawsuit for civil damages against Donald Eugene Webb, his wife Lillian Webb, and Webb&#x27;s stepson Stanley Webb. FBI investigators had announced that in 2016 they had discovered a secret room hidden behind a closet in the basement of Lillian Webb&#x27;s home in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The room had not existed when Lillian purchased the home. Agents also discovered a cane inside the room, which they believed may have been used by Webb after being shot in the leg by Adams. The lawsuit had to be dropped in exchange for the revelation due to criminal and civil immunity.

On June 15, 2017, the FBI released newly acquired photographs of Webb taken in the 1970s. They hoped these would aid in gaining the public&#x27;s assistance in either capturing Webb or locating his remains. Faced with prosecution for harboring a criminal, Lillian Webb arranged to confess to police and the FBI. She told about sheltering Webb, and the strokes he suffered near the end of his life. He had been treated for four weeks in Tobey Hospital in Wareham, Massachusetts, under an assumed name for a compound fracture to his leg in 1980 after the murder.

She led the FBI to human remains buried on the grounds of her Dartmouth home. On July 17, 2017, the remains were identified by FBI forensic investigators as belonging to Webb. The investigators found that Webb had died in 1999 after suffering multiple strokes. State police documents said that Webb had lived for nearly 19 years hidden by his wife in the two different houses where she lived in at that time.

<text>Solomon Porfirio Ortiz (born June 3, 1937) is an American former politician who served as the U.S. representative for , based in Corpus Christi, serving from 1983 until 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2010, Ortiz was narrowly defeated by Republican challenger Blake Farenthold. Ortiz&#x27;s son, Solomon Ortiz, Jr., is a former state representative.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Solomon Ortiz was born in Robstown, Nueces County, Texas; his family had immigrated from Mexico. As a boy, he held several odd jobs, including working as a shoeshiner and an ink fogger for &quot;The Robstown Record&#x27;s&quot; letter press. Ortiz befriended, and became fascinated with, law enforcement officers. He attended Robstown High School until the age of 19, when he dropped out after his father&#x27;s death to help support his family.

Ortiz joined the United States Army in 1960, serving two years and earning his GED. He received basic training at Fort Hood, Texas, and served a tour of duty in Verdun and Vitry-le-François, France. Expressing his interest in law enforcement, Ortiz was reassigned to the 61st Military Police Company Criminal Investigation Office and received advanced military police training at Fort Gordon, Georgia.

After returning to South Texas, Ortiz worked for three years as an insurance agent.

==Early political career==
In 1964, he was urged by friends to run for Nueces County constable, and was elected in 1965, defeating the incumbent in a runoff election. He was elected to the county commissioners court of Nueces County in 1969, the first Hispanic to serve in that capacity. He remained in that position until 1976, when he was elected county sheriff, another first for a Hispanic in Nueces County.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
When the 27th District was created in 1982, Ortiz ran for the seat on a platform of jobs incentives and attention to education. He won the Democratic primary run-off election with 52% of the vote, defeating Republican State Representative Joe Salem. In the general election, he won with 64% of the vote.

He won re-election 13 times, dipping below 60% of the vote only four times before 2010. His lowest winning percentage was in 1992, when he defeated Republican Jay Kimbrough 55%-43%.

;2010

On November 2, election night, Ortiz appeared to have lost to the Republican challenger, Blake Farenthold, but Ortiz requested a recount. Ortiz conceded after the November 22 recount. Farenthold narrowly defeated him 47.8%-47.1%, by a margin of just 770 votes. While Ortiz had won four of the district&#x27;s six counties, he lost the two northernmost counties, San Patricio and his home county of Nueces.

===Tenure===
Ortiz is a Democratic moderate. He is socially conservative, but economically liberal. For example, he is anti-abortion, but usually voted with his party on economic issues.

===Committee assignments===
;111th Congress

*Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Readiness (Chairman)
**Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces
*Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
**Subcommittee on Aviation
**Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
**Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment

<text>Murlagan is a small hamlet located on the north shore of Loch Arkaig in Inverness-shire, Scottish Highlands and is in the Scottish council area of Highland. Murlagan, also called Murlaggan and Mhurlagain, is the location of the minor seat of Clan MacMillan.

==History==
The Murlagan, chief of Clan MacMillan was tacksman to Cameron of Lochiel.

The progenitor of this branch was Alexander, second son of John MacMillan, possessor of Glenpeanmore. According to family tradition, he and his brothers were out during the &#x27;45. It is also a family tradition that he and Doctor Archibald Cameron of Lochiel hid the Prince&#x27;s gold at the Callich burn while the Hanoverian troops were hot on their heels coming from Murlaggan private burial-ground where they hid it for a time among loose soil from a newly opened grave. – &quot;Bygone Lochaber&quot;, Somerled MacMillan (1971)

Many generations of these MacMillans served the Camerons of Lochiel and worked land on Loch Arkaig, below the Mountain called Murlagan at the inland end of Loch Arkaig, which is near Fort William in the highlands of Scotland.

John the (Seventh?) of Murlagan resisted Bonny Prince Charlie&#x27;s attempt in 1745 for the British throne although his two sons went out in support of the prince under Cameron of Locheil, and one died at Culloden, the other rescued the prince and the last skirmish of the 1745 rebellion against the House of Hanover was on the land and policies of Murlagan, where French gold to fund the rebellion was rumoured buried,as the remnants scattered into hiding and the Prince went on his secret journey to the Isle of Skye and exile in France and into legend.

==Emigration==
Many MacMillans and relatives left Loch Arkaig for a new beginning and went to Canada in 1802, and their descendants returned in 2002 to raise a cairn at Murlagan during &quot;The Great Return&quot;.

Archibald MacMillan of Murlaganand and Allan MacMillan of Glenpean, along with 200 clansmen, emigrated to Canada about the year 1802. Murlagan settled in Montreal where he was engaged in mercantile pursuits. Shortly after his arrival in Canada he applied to the Governor General for land for himself and the majority of those who accompanied him. After several court attendances on the Governor at Quebec, he obtained two and a quarter townships, namely those of Suffolk, Templeton and Grenville on the banks of the River Ottawa. – &quot;The MacMillans and their Septs&quot;, Somerled MacMillan (1952)

<text>W. Timothy Gallwey (born 1938 in San Francisco) is an author who has written a series of books in which he has set forth a methodology for coaching and for the development of personal and professional excellence in a variety of fields that he calls &quot;the Inner Game&quot;. Since he began writing in the 1970s, his books include &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis&quot;, &quot;The Inner Game of Golf&quot;, &quot;The Inner Game of Music&quot; (with Barry Green), &quot;Inner Skiing&quot; and &quot;The Inner Game of Work&quot;. Gallwey&#x27;s seminal work is &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis&quot;, with more than one million copies in print. 

==Career==
In 1960, Gallwey was captain of the Harvard University Tennis Team. In the 1970s he learned meditation techniques which Gallwey said enhanced his powers of concentration in a manner that improved his game.
===Inner game===
The &quot;inner game&quot; is based upon certain principles in which an individual uses non-judgmental observations of critical variables, with the purpose of being accurate about these observations. If the observations are accurate, the person&#x27;s body will adjust and correct automatically to achieve best performance. Gallwey was one of the first to demonstrate a comprehensive method of coaching that could be applied to many situations, and found himself lecturing more often to business leaders in the U.S. than to sports people.

<text>Ayşe Ajda Pekkan (; born 12 February 1946) is a Turkish singer. She is known by the title &quot;superstar&quot; in the Turkish media. Pekkan became a prominent figure of Turkish pop music with her songs, in which she tried to create a strong female figure. By keeping her works updated and getting influence from Western elements, she managed to become one of Turkey&#x27;s modern and enduring icons in different periods. Her musical style has kept her popular for more than 50 years and has inspired many of her successors. Pekkan is highly respected in the music industry and her vocal techniques together with many of her albums were praised by music critics.

Born in Beyoğlu, Istanbul, Pekkan&#x27;s musical career began in the early 1960s when she appeared in a nightclub as a member of the music group Los Çatikos. However, in 1963, when she won the &quot;Ses&quot; magazine&#x27;s cinema artist competition, she became known as an actress, and for a number of years she pursued an acting career. In the same year, she played the leading role in her first film &quot;Adanalı Tayfur&quot; and became one of the young faces of Turkish cinema at the time. Over the next six years, she starred in nearly 50 black and white films, including &quot;Şıpsevdi&quot; (1963), &quot;Hızır Dede&quot; (1964) and &quot;Şaka ile Karışık&quot; (1965). She eventually quit acting and focused entirely on her singing career.

Pekkan spent the first twenty years of her singing career with dozens of songs released as cover versions. These songs, which were generally written by Fikret Şeneş and included &quot;Kimler Geldi Kimler Geçti&quot;, &quot;Palavra Palavra&quot;, &quot;Sana Neler Edeceğim&quot;, &quot;Hoş Gör Sen&quot;, &quot;Sana Ne Kime Ne&quot;, &quot;Bambaşka Biri&quot;, &quot;Uykusuz Her Gece&quot; and &quot;O Benim Dünyam&quot;, later took their place among the best known songs of both Pekkan&#x27;s career and the Turkish pop music genre. From the 1990s onwards, she worked with various songwriters and arrangers, including Şehrazat and Sezen Aksu. During this period, many of her songs such as &quot;Yaz Yaz Yaz&quot;, &quot;Sarıl Bana&quot;, &quot;Eğlen Güzelim&quot;, &quot;Vitrin&quot;, &quot;Aynen Öyle&quot; and &quot;Yakar Geçerim&quot; ranked among the best songs on Turkey&#x27;s music charts.

Her fame grew steadily throughout the 1970s outside her home country, and particularly in Europe, and it was reinforced by concerts in different countries. She also recorded a French album in 1978. Due to her increasing popularity, Pekkan was viewed as a potential candidate to represent Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 and she reluctantly accepted to participate in the contest. Disappointed that her song &quot;Pet&#x27;r Oil&quot; ranked fifteenth in the contest, she decided to take a break from her career for a few years.

By selling over 15 million records, Ajda Pekkan is one of the best-selling artists of all time in Turkey. She also holds the title of &quot;State Artist&quot; in Turkey and has been awarded the honorary distinction of Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government. Three of her albums were included in the list of the Best 100 Albums of Turkey by &quot;Hürriyet&quot; newspaper. In 2016, Pekkan&#x27;s name appeared in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Power 100, a list of the 100 most powerful women in entertainment. Although she does not self-identify as a feminist, many of her songs which tell the stories of powerful women were used as feminist anthems.

== Early life ==
Ajda Pekkan was born on 12 February 1946 in Istanbul. She is of Bosniak descent. Her father Rıdvan Pekkan was a commander in Turkish Navy, and her mother Gülten Nevin Dobruca was a housewife. Pekkan and her family later moved to Gölcük, Kocaeli, due to her father&#x27;s work. Pekkan, who always wanted to have a child, married for the first time in her 20s and as her husband wanted her to finish her career in music, she got divorced and later cited not having children as the greatest sacrifice she had made to continue her career. Sezen Aksu, who is a close friend of Pekkan, said about her influence on her: &quot;She has opened this way to us, thanks to her I am here too. Ajda&#x27;s nickname is Angela. We meet quite often at home. We do not have any hidden secrets. Where Ajda goes or what she eats, I also go there and eat the same thing.&quot;

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
With the help of her sister Semiramis Pekkan, she met İlham Gencer, the owner of &quot;Çatı&quot; nightclub in 1961 and began her music career by singing Mina&#x27;s song &quot;Il Cielo In Una Stanza&quot; With the help of &quot;Los Çatikos&quot; music community, she performed at a few places for a while. In 1963, at a singing and acting competition organized by &quot;Ses&quot; magazine named &quot;Ses Sinema Artisti Yarışması&quot;, Pekkan ranked first in women&#x27;s category followed by Hülya Koçyiğit. By winning the competition and with her modern style, she started to attract attention.
Before starting her acting career, she met Fecri Ebcioğlu, who helped her through her music career and in 1965 arranged Pekkan&#x27;s first record &quot;Her Yerde Kar Var&quot;, which is the Turkish version of the song Tombe la neige by Salvatore Adamo.

Throughout the 1960s, Pekkan and Ebcioğlu collaborated on numerous records, where Ebcioğlu would write the Turkish lyrics for popular French, Italian or English songs and Pekkan would sing them in her own unique style. In 1967, her record &quot;İki Yabancı&quot;, which is the Turkish version of the song Strangers in the Night by Frank Sinatra, broke the sales records in Turkey.

She represented Turkey at the International Apollonia Music Festival in Athens, where she performed the songs &quot;Ozleyis&quot; and &quot;Perhaps One Day&quot; in 1968 and 1969, respectively. She also represented Turkey in 1969 at the Mediterranean Song Festival in Barcelona, performing the song &quot;Ve Ben Şimdi&quot;. Her songs have been used on the soundtracks of many films throughout the 1960s. She also began to perform with Zeki Müren.

===1970s onwards===

By the beginning of the 1970s, she had stopped working with Fecri Ebcioğlu and started to work with Fikret Şeneş. Their first collaboration, Sensiz Yillarda, broke another sales record in Turkey. This song was released under Philips label, whom had signed her a year earlier. This would also be the turning point of Pekkan&#x27;s career, where she would start releasing records at countries outside of Turkey. The first two 45 RPMs she released with Philips label, &quot;Sensiz Yıllarda/Olmadı Gitti&quot; and &quot;Yağmur/Tek Yaşanır mı&quot; were also recorded in Greek and released in Greece. Although, Philips records moved out of Turkey in 1971, Pekkan was signed with them until 1978 for business outside of Turkey. She would go on to release numerous records under Philips International label around the globe in the 1970s. This included her two 45RPMs in Germany and Spain, three 45RPMs in Japan, and seven 45RPMs in France. Her collaboration with Philips International would come to an end after she released her French Album, &quot;Pour Lui&quot; in 1978.

Pekkan, who switched to İstanbul Plak in 1972, broke yet another sales record with her 45RPM, &quot;Dert Bende Derman Sende&quot;, which is an arabesque style song. In 1973, her producer Fikret Şeneş was very insistent on her recording the song &quot;Kimler Geldi Kimler Geçti&quot;, although Pekkan thought that the song was not her style. However, &quot;Kimler Geldi Kimler Geçti&quot; would become a very big hit in 1973 after it was featured on the B-side of the 45RPM &quot;Kaderimin Oyunu&quot;. It has been said by Nino Varon that the song &quot;Kimler Geldi Kimler Geçti&quot; is the most meaningful song ever written in the Turkish.

Pekkan collected her songs from all previous records, except the one published by Istanbul Plak in 1972, and put them in her first compilation album &quot;Ajda&quot;, which was published in July 1975. A new song, &quot;Erkek Adın&quot;, was also included in the album as well. The album received interest. Cüneyt Türel was featured on the song &quot;Palavra Palavra&quot; in this album.

Pekkan, who was known as &quot;Superstar&quot; by 1977, published her new album &quot;Süperstar&quot; with different cover designs and production. In the same year, she performed the song &quot;A Mes Amours&quot; at Yamaha Music Festival in Tokyo. Pekkan gave a concert in Tehran at that time and this concert was broadcast on television and well received by the Turkish audience.
Pekkan&#x27;s increasing popularity outside her own country and in Europe, created a public desire for her to represent Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 and fix the country&#x27;s general image following its poor performances in the contest in the previous years. Although she initially refused to participate in the competition as she found it &quot;amateur&quot;, she finally accepted the offer given to her by TRT. She took part in the contest with the song &quot;Pet&#x27;r Oil&quot; and finished 15th, which left her deeply disappointed; the ranking had a shocking effect not only for herself, but also for the circles who were sure she would get a high rating. After the contest Pekkan left Istanbul and lived in London and Los Angeles for months. During this period, she tried to overcome the psychological problems arising from the problems she experienced in her career and private life. In Los Angeles, she fell ill with jaundice and went through a two-month convalescence. It wasn&#x27;t until July 1982 that she fully recovered and returned to Turkey.

After &quot;Pet&#x27;r Oil&quot;, the singer ended her contract with Philips Records and signed a new one with Yaşar Kekeva Plak. She also put an end to her career outside Turkey and started to release songs only in Turkey. Complying with the arabesque music trend that rose in the country, in September 1981, she released the LP record &quot;Sen Mutlu Ol&quot; from this company. However, when she was not satisfied with the results, she did not want to work with the same company for a second album. Upon her reluctance to record the second record, she was legally challenged by Yaşar Kekeva. During this period, Kekeva released seven songs that were prepared for the previous record but not released in it. These songs were published under a new separate record titled &quot;Sevdim Seni&quot; (1982) without Pekkan&#x27;s permission. Nevertheless, as per the contract, Pekkan owed three more songs to the company, and it was not legally possible for her to produce a new record or to negotiate with a new company until the completion of these songs. Finally, she went to the studio and recorded three new songs, and her album &quot;Sevdim Seni&quot; was edited and republished in March 1983, and her agreement with Yaşar Kekeva Plak ended.

In August 1982, Ajda Pekkan took the stage with Metin Akpınar and Zeki Alasya at the Istanbul Open-Air Theater with the musical &quot;Büyük Kabare&quot;, and came to the stage for the first time after approximately 2.5 years. In this musical, she collaborated again with Fikret Şeneş; Şeneş prepared six songs for the musical, including some of the songs that would later be included in Pekkan&#x27;s next album. Pekkan&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Süperstar &#x27;83&quot;, was released in March 1983 by Balet Plak. The album topped &quot;Hey&quot; magazine&#x27;s Local Pop Music/Foreign Pop Music chart for five weeks. It was promoted at the Şan Music Hall in Istanbul with the musical &quot;Süperstar Ajda &#x27;83&quot;. Various songs from this album, including &quot;Uykusuz Her Gece&quot;, &quot;Bir Günah Gibi&quot;, &quot;Son Yolcu&quot; and &quot;Düşünme Hiç&quot;, became among Pekkan&#x27;s and Turk pop music&#x27;s best known songs. At the 1983 Music Oscars award ceremony organized by &quot;Hey&quot; magazine, the album received the Light Music LP of the Year award. Due to the album&#x27;s success, at the 1984 Golden Butterfly Awards Pekkan was awarded as the Light Music Artist of the Year.

In 2002, Pekkan was cast in a leading role in the movie &quot;Şöhret Sandalı&quot; alongside Ediz Hun and Halil Ergün. The film, which was produced by Oya Demirtok and directed by Ayşe Ersayın, has not been released to this day.

In 2011, Pekkan released her single &quot;Yakar Geçerim&quot;, written by acclaimed Turkish singer Tarkan, which ranked second on Turkey&#x27;s official music chart. A month later the single was followed by her album, &quot;Farkin Bu&quot;. The album ranked first on D&amp;R&#x27;s list of best-selling albums in Turkey and eventually sold 175,000 copies. In 2013 she released another single, &quot;Ara Sıcak&quot;. The song was written by Turkish singer Gülşen and ranked third on the official music chart in Turkey. Pekkan has continued her career by releasing singles &quot;Yakarım Canını&quot; (2015), &quot;Ayrılık Ateşi&quot; (2016), and &quot;Canın Sağ Olsun&quot; (2019), the first of which ranked fourth on Turkey&#x27;s official chart.

Pekkan, who appeared in many movies in the 1960s, was criticized by some men in the media for her new style and physics, and in the second year of her acting career she published a sensational article on the magazine &quot;Bikini&quot;, titled &quot;I destroy the idols&quot;.

Pekkan, who had become known for her songs and new style, was also much talked about in the media due to her fashion sense. In an interview, she said: &quot;How I have been seen until today, I continue to be like that in the future. As a soldier&#x27;s daughter, I can not do anything that is different from my style.&quot; Naim Dilmener published a book titled &quot;Hür Doğdum Hür Yaşarım&quot; in 2007 about Ajda Pekkan&#x27;s life and music career. Pekkan&#x27;s views on feminism are included in her biography.

Pekkan is an activist for women and has spoken against issues such as domestic violence, abuse of women, illiteracy, discrimination, and has released a music video addressing the issue of &quot;violence against women&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Hürriyet&quot; prepared a TV commercial about liberty for all, in which Pekkan performed the song &quot;Hürriyet Benim&quot; (Liberty is Mine).

In the album &quot;Güldünya Şarkıları&quot;, which various artists prepared for the purpose of helping the Domestic Violence Emergency Helpline, Pekkan performed the song &quot;Kadın Dediğin&quot;, and together with Aynur Doğan, she promoted the album by performing the song &quot;Keçe Kurdan&quot;, which had previously been banned by a court decision. Pekkan was the first artist to support to the democratic initiative proposed by the 60th government of Turkey.

Ajda Pekkan, who is among the respectable names of Turkish pop music, has a number of connections with many other Turkish artists. As a part of &quot;Güldünya Şarkıları&quot;″s project, she visited Bakırköy Women&#x27;s Prison, where she also met and comforted Deniz Seki who was being held in State custody.

Pekkan, who is a close friend of Sezen Aksu, is also known for her friendly relations with Nilüfer and Nükhet Duru. Sertab Erener, Funda Arar and Bengü are said to be her favorite artists. Like Hande Yener and İzel, Pekkan continues to release songs that are similar to her previous works in terms of style and arrangement.

Ajda Pekkan is accepted as a gay icon within Turkey&#x27;s LGBT community. In a survey done by KAOS GL in 2007, she was chosen as the second most popular gay icon of Turkey.

Pekkan, who is a supporter of animal rights, participated in a meeting in February 2011 to meet Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and discuss issues surrounding animal rights. She has adopted and cared for a number of street animals, including a cat named &quot;Beyaz&quot; and a dog named &quot;Apple&quot;. On 7 May 2013, Pekkan visited the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and saw a discussion about animal rights which took place in the assembly.

In August 2011, together with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a group of artists, Pekkan visited Somalia. In October 2011, she gave a concert to help Somalians who had settled in Istanbul. In April 2018, she and a number of artists accompanied President Erdoğan on a visit to Hatay to meet soldiers who had participated in Operation Olive Branch.

During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Pekkan took to Instagram to post a map with Armenia erased from the map, alongside the Turkish and Azerbaijani flags.

== Personal life ==
On 17 November 1973, Pekkan married Coşkun Sapmaz. The marriage lasted for only 6 days. She was engaged for a second time in 1979 to journalist Erol Yaraş at the İzmir Fair. The couple&#x27;s engagement rings were presented to them by Metin Akpınar and Zeki Alasya. In 1984, she married Ali Bars. The couple remained married for 6 years. Pekkan mentions her decision to not have children as her biggest regret. Six of her pregnancies ended in abortion as she wanted to focus on her career. Pekkan has performed in many places inside and outside Turkey, and in addition to Turkish, has sung in English, French, Italian, and Japanese.

Pekkan, who did not finish her education at Çamlıca Girls High School, started her music and acting career early and took singing lessons from Leyla Demiriş.

In 2017, Pekkan acquired citizenship from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
