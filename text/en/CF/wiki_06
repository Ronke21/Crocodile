<text>On July 17, 1981, two overhead walkways in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 216. Loaded with partygoers, the concrete and glass platforms crashed onto a tea dance in the lobby. The collapse resulted in billions of dollars of insurance claims, legal investigations, and city government reforms.

The hotel had been built just a few years before, during a nationwide pattern of fast-tracked large construction with reduced oversight and major failures. Its roof had partially collapsed during construction, and the ill-conceived skywalk design progressively degraded due to a miscommunication loop of corporate neglect and irresponsibility. An investigation concluded that it would have failed even under one-third of the weight it held that night. Convicted of gross negligence, misconduct and unprofessional conduct, the engineering company lost its national affiliation and all engineering licenses in four states, but was acquitted of criminal charges. Company owner and engineer of record Jack D. Gillum eventually claimed full responsibility for the collapse and its obvious, but unchecked, design flaws, and he became an engineering disaster lecturer.

The disaster contributed many lessons and reforms to engineering ethics and safety, and to emergency management. It was the deadliest non-deliberate structural failure since the collapse of Pemberton Mill over 120 years earlier, and remained the second deadliest structural collapse in the United States until the collapse of the World Trade Center towers 20 years later.

==Background==
&quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; described the national climate of the late 1970s as &quot;high unemployment, inflation and double-digit interest rates [that added] pressure on builders to win contracts and complete projects swiftly&quot;. Described by the newspaper as fast-tracked, construction began in May 1978 on the 40-story Hyatt Regency Kansas City. There were numerous delays and setbacks, including the collapse of of the roof. The newspaper observed that &quot;Notable structures around the country were failing at an alarming rate&quot;, which included the 1979 Kemper Arena roof collapse and the 1978 Hartford Civic Center roof collapse. The hotel officially opened on July 1, 1980.

The hotel&#x27;s lobby was its defining feature, with a multi-story atrium spanned by elevated walkways suspended from the ceiling. These steel, glass and concrete crossings connected the second, third and fourth floors between the north and south wings. The walkways were about long and weighed about . The fourth-level walkway was directly above the second-level walkway.

==Collapse==
About 1,600 people gathered in the atrium for a tea dance on the evening of Friday, July 17, 1981. The second-level walkway held about 40 people at about 7:05 p.m., with more on the third and an additional 16 to 20 on the fourth. The fourth-floor bridge was suspended directly over the second-floor bridge, with the third-floor walkway offset several yards from the others. Guests heard popping noises and a loud crack moments before the fourth-floor walkway dropped several inches, paused, then fell completely onto the second-floor walkway. Both walkways then fell to the crowded lobby floor. A diner at the 42nd-floor revolving restaurant atop the Hyatt said it felt like an explosion.

The rescue operation lasted 14 hours, directed by Kansas City emergency medical director Joseph Waeckerle. Survivors were buried beneath the walkways&#x27; many tons of steel, concrete and glass, which the fire department&#x27;s jacks could not move. Volunteers responded to an appeal and brought jacks, flashlights, compressors, jackhammers, concrete saws and generators from construction companies and suppliers. They also brought cranes and forced the booms through the lobby windows to lift debris. Deputy Fire Chief Arnett Williams recalled this immediate outpouring from the industrial community: &quot;They said &#x27;take what you want&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know if all those people got their equipment back. But no one has ever asked for an accounting and no one has ever submitted a bill.&quot;

The dead were taken to a ground-floor exhibition area as a makeshift morgue, and the hotel&#x27;s driveway and lawn were used as a triage area. Able survivors were instructed to leave the hotel to simplify the rescue effort, and morphine was given to the mortally injured. Blood centers quickly received lineups of hundreds of donors. The Life Line helicopter pilot compared the carnage to the Vietnam War but in greater numbers.

Visibility was poor because of dust and because the power had been cut to prevent fires. Water from the hotel&#x27;s ruptured sprinkler system flooded the lobby and put trapped survivors at risk of drowning. The final rescued victim, Mark Williams, spent more than nine hours pinned underneath the lower skywalk with both legs dislocated and having nearly drowned before the water was shut off.

== Casualties ==
A total of 114 were killed and 216 injured, 29 of whom were rescued from the rubble. Rescuers often had to dismember bodies to reach survivors among the wreckage. A surgeon spent 20 minutes amputating one victim&#x27;s pinned and unsalvageable leg with a chainsaw; that victim later died.

==Investigation==

&quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; hired architectural engineer Wayne G. Lischka and national engineering firm Simpson, Gumpertz, and Heger Inc. to investigate the collapse, and Lischka discovered a change to the original design of the walkways. Within days, a laboratory at Lehigh University began testing box beams on behalf of the steel fabrication source. The Missouri licensing board, the state attorney general and Jackson County investigated the collapse over the following years. Edward Pfrang, lead investigator for the National Bureau of Standards, characterized the neglectful corporate culture surrounding the entire Hyatt construction project as &quot;everyone wanting to walk away from responsibility&quot;. The NBS&#x27;s final report cited structural overload resulting from design flaws where &quot;the walkways had only minimal capacity to resist their own weight&quot;. Pfrang concluded they would have failed with one-third of the occupants&#x27; weight.

Investigators found that the collapse was the result of changes to the design of the walkway&#x27;s steel hanger rods. The two walkways were suspended from a set of steel hanger rods, with the second-floor walkway hanging directly under the fourth-floor walkway. The fourth-floor walkway platform was supported on three cross-beams suspended by the steel rods retained by nuts. The cross-beams were box girders made from C-channel strips welded together lengthwise, with a hollow space between them. The original design by Jack D. Gillum and Associates specified three pairs of rods running from the second-floor walkway to the ceiling, passing through the beams of the fourth-floor walkway, with a nut at the middle of each tie rod tightened up to the bottom of the fourth-floor walkway, and a nut at the bottom of each tie rod tightened up to the bottom of the second-floor walkway. Even this original design supported only 60% of the minimum load required by Kansas City building codes.

Havens Steel Company had manufactured the rods, and the company objected that the whole rod below the fourth floor would have to be threaded in order to screw on the nuts to hold the fourth-floor walkway in place. These threads would be subject to damage as the fourth-floor structure was hoisted into place. Havens Steel proposed that two separate and offset sets of rods be used: the first set suspending the fourth-floor walkway from the ceiling, and the second set suspending the second-floor walkway from the fourth-floor walkway.

This design change would be fatal. In the original design, the beams of the fourth-floor walkway had to support only the weight of the fourth-floor walkway, with the weight of the second-floor walkway supported completely by the rods. In the revised design, however, the fourth-floor beams supported both the fourth- and second-floor walkways, but were strong enough only for 30% of that load.

The serious flaws of the revised design were compounded by the fact that both designs placed the bolts directly through a welded joint connecting two C-channels, the weakest structural point in the box beams. Photographs of the wreckage show excessive deformations of the cross-section. During the failure, the box beams split along the weld and the nut supporting them slipped through the resulting gap, which was consistent with reports that the upper walkway at first fell several inches, after which the nut was held only by the upper side of the box beams; then the upper side of the box beams failed as well, allowing the entire walkway to fall in a cascading failure. A court order was required to retrieve the skywalk pieces from storage for examination.

Investigators concluded that the underlying problem was a lack of proper communication between Jack D. Gillum and Associates and Havens Steel. In particular, the drawings prepared by Gillum and Associates were only preliminary sketches, but Havens Steel interpreted them as finalized drawings. Gillum and Associates failed to review the initial design thoroughly, and engineer Daniel M. Duncan accepted Havens Steel&#x27;s proposed plan via a phone call without performing necessary calculations or viewing sketches that would have revealed its serious intrinsic flaws—in particular, doubling the load on the fourth-floor beams. Reports and court testimony cited a feedback loop of architects&#x27; unverified assumptions, each having believed that someone else had performed calculations and checked reinforcements but without any actual root in documentation or review channels. Onsite workers had neglected to report noticing beams bending, and instead rerouted their heavy wheelbarrows around the unsteady walkways.

Jack D. Gillum would later reflect that the design flaw was so obvious that &quot;any first-year engineering student could figure it out,&quot; if only it had been checked.

== Legal ==
The Missouri Board of Architects, Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors found the engineers at Jack D. Gillum and Associates who had approved the final drawings to be culpable of gross negligence, misconduct, and unprofessional conduct in the practice of engineering. They were acquitted of all the crimes with which they were initially charged, but the company lost its engineering licenses in Missouri, Kansas and Texas, and lost its membership with the American Society of Civil Engineers.

In the months after the disaster, more than 300 lawsuits sought a cumulative total of (equivalent to $ in ). Of this, at least (equivalent to $ in ) was actually awarded to victims and their families, under hotel owner Crown Center Redevelopment Corporation. The single largest award was about , for a victim who required full-time medical care. A class-action lawsuit seeking punitive damages was won against Crown Center Corporation, a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards. That lawsuit yielded $10 million, including $6.5 million dedicated as donations to charitable and civic endeavors that Hallmark called a &quot;healing gesture to help Kansas City put the tragedy of the skywalks&#x27; collapse behind it.&quot; Each of the approximately 1,600 hotel occupants from that night was unconditionally offered , of which 1,300 accepted by the deadline. Every defendantincluding Hallmark Cards, Crown Center Corporation, architects, engineers, and the contractordenied all legal liability, including that of the egregious engineering faults.

==Aftermath==
The hotel reopened three months after the tragedy. In 1983, local authorities reported that the $5 million hotel reconstruction made the building &quot;possibly the safest in the country.&quot; The hotel was renamed the Hyatt Regency Crown Center in 1987, and the Sheraton Kansas City at Crown Center in 2011. It has been renovated numerous times since, though the lobby retains the same layout and design.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said the victims were soon overshadowed by the community&#x27;s daily preoccupation with the disaster and its polarized attitude of blame-seeking and &quot;vendetta&quot; that soon targeted even the local newspapers, judges and lawyers: &quot;Seldom has a city&#x27;s establishment been so emotionally torn by catastrophe as Kansas City&#x27;s was&quot;. The owner of the Kansas City Star Company guessed that the huge victim count ensured that &quot;virtually half the town was affected directly or indirectly by the horror of the tragedy&quot;. The newspaper generated 16 months&#x27; worth of Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative coverage of the disasterputting the newspaper at odds with the Kansas City community in general, including the management of Hallmark Cards, the parent company of the hotel&#x27;s owner.

Several rescuers suffered considerable stress due to their experience and later relied upon each other in an informal support group.

== Legacy ==
The world responded to the Hyatt disaster by upgrading the culture and academic curriculum of engineering ethics and emergency management. In this respect, the event joins the legacies of the 1984 Bhopal disaster, the 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

The disaster provides a case study teaching first responders the &quot;all-hazards approach&quot; to multiple disciplines across jurisdictions, and teaching university students in engineering ethics classes how the smallest personal responsibility can impact the biggest projects with the worst possible results.

The American Society of Civil Engineers adopted a clear policy—which carries weight in court—that structural engineers are now ultimately responsible for reviewing shop drawings by fabricators. Trade groups such as the ASCE issued investigations, improved standards of peer review, sponsored seminars and created trade manuals for the improvement of professional standards and public confidence. The Kansas City Codes Administration became its own department, doubling its staff and dedicating a single engineer comprehensively to all aspects of each reviewed building. Kansas City politics and government were colored for years with investigations against corruption. In 1983, the disaster was cited in the argument against the Reagan administration&#x27;s attempt to eliminate an agency of the National Bureau of Standards.

&quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; and its associated publication the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; won a Pulitzer Prize in 1982 for their 16 months of investigative coverage of the collapse.

A memorial was dedicated by Skywalk Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit organization established for victims of the collapse, on November 12, 2015, in Hospital Hill Park across the street from the hotel. It included a $25,000 donation from Hallmark Cards.

Jack D. Gillum (1928–2012), the owner of the engineering company and an engineer of record for the Hyatt project, occasionally lectured at engineering conferences for years after the tragedy. Claiming full responsibility and disturbed by his memories &quot;365 days a year&quot;, he said he wanted &quot;to scare the daylights out of them&quot; in the hope of preventing future mistakes.

<text>John Ellis O&#x27;Neill is a Vietnam War veteran and lawyer who was the spokesman for Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.

==Background==

O&#x27;Neill is from San Antonio, Texas. His grandfather was Superintendent of the Chemistry Department at the Naval Experiment Station across the Severn River from the United States Naval Academy and his father was a rear admiral. He said he followed his two brothers into the Naval Academy, graduating in 1967.

O&#x27;Neill married Anne Bradley (1947–2006) in 1976, and the couple had two children. His book &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; is dedicated to her.

==Vietnam==

O&#x27;Neill served in the United States Navy during the Vietnam War. He commanded PCF-94, a swift boat that had previously been commanded by John Kerry, and returned from his tour of duty in June 1970. He was awarded two Bronze Stars during his service.

==Recruitment by Nixon White House==
In 1971, Kerry, representing Vietnam Veterans Against the War, testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that American soldiers were committing war crimes in Vietnam. Resentful of the allegations, O&#x27;Neill began giving television interviews opposing Kerry, supporting President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Vietnam policies, and representing the newly-formed Vietnam Veterans for a Just Peace. According to a White House memo, O&#x27;Neill was disappointed with the negative reactions to his speaking appointments and was considering ending his advocacy by June 1971.

The Nixon White House responded to Kerry&#x27;s critical testimony by searching for and recruiting veterans who could counter Kerry&#x27;s narrative. Impressed with one of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s appearances, Nixon&#x27;s special counsel Charles Colson arranged for O&#x27;Neill and Nixon to meet on June 16. They spent almost an hour in the Oval Office, strategizing about how to stop Kerry. After the meeting, Colson and O&#x27;Neill began challenging Kerry to debate O&#x27;Neill on live television. Kerry agreed to a June 30 debate on the Dick Cavett Show on ABC.

O&#x27;Neill strongly defended American incursions in Laos and Cambodia, and opposed anti-war veterans. He was particularly critical of claims regarding the commission of war crimes by US military personnel in Vietnam.

==Legal career==
After 1971, O&#x27;Neill moved out of the media spotlight. He studied law at the University of Texas, graduating first in his class in 1973 and being admitted to the bar in 1974. Appointed to the President&#x27;s National Advisory Counsel on Supplemental Services and Centers, he served from 1973 to 1974. He was a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice William H. Rehnquist from 1974 to 1975.

O&#x27;Neill subsequently returned to Texas to practice law, specializing in commercial litigation. He later co-founded the law firm Clements, O&#x27;Neill, Pierce, Wilson, and Fulkerson in Houston. His partners at that firm included, among others, Margaret Wilson, who once served as general counsel for George W. Bush during his time as governor of Texas, and the late Tex Lazar, who once ran for lieutenant governor on the same ticket with Bush and who died in 2003. The firm was recently subsumed into the larger Howrey LLP.

According to his most recent firm resume, in addition to practicing oil and gas litigation, O&#x27;Neill obtained one of the largest securities arbitration judgments in history representing a small-time investor who had been defrauded by a large securities company, and also successfully represented a class of immigrants in a suit against Fiesta Savings &amp; Loan, allowing them to recover their money when the savings and loan went under.

&quot;Texas Lawyer&quot; magazine reported on February 19 and 26, 1990, that O&#x27;Neill, who was representing the plaintiffs in a securities fraud class action underlying a malpractice suit, and two other lawyers, were threatened with sanctions for allegedly violating the Texas Code of Professional Responsibility by the judge in the case, United States District Judge David Hittner, who declined to pursue the matter after the trial was completed.

In 1991, O&#x27;Neill was considered by President George H. W. Bush for nomination as a federal judge in Texas, but was passed over.

==Swift Boat Veterans==
O&#x27;Neill stated that he turned down several requests over the years, including some from Kerry&#x27;s electoral opponents, to resume his attacks upon Kerry. However, he returned to the fore in 2004 as a cofounder of a new organization, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, later known as Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, and he is listed as the co-author, with conservative Jerome Corsi, of the book &quot;Unfit For Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry&quot;. Due to the baseless and false accusations included in the book and many of his public speaking events, the term &quot;swiftboating&quot; entered the public lexicon as an American neologism used to describe an unfair or untrue political attack. O&#x27;Neill stated that his main reason for resuming the activities was that Kerry was running for the office of President of the United States, the Commander in Chief of the US armed forces. After Kerry lost the election, O&#x27;Neill stated that he planned to return to private life. However, he continues to make some public appearances and give public interviews.

==Political contributions and activities==
O&#x27;Neill has stated that he considers himself a &quot;political independent.&quot; He has stated that he voted for Al Gore in 2000, and Ross Perot in 1996 and also in 1992, but records indicate he donated to the 1992 Bush-Quayle primary campaign. He has stated that he admired Democrat John Edwards during the 2004 Democratic primary but did not claim to have voted for him in that primary. However, with the exception of the 2000 election, he has not claimed to have voted for any Democratic presidential candidate since Hubert Humphrey in 1968. While he told Nixon in 1971 that he had not voted for him in the 1968 election, he seconded Nixon&#x27;s nomination at the 1972 Republican National Convention. Available records indicate he voted in the Republican state primary in 1998 and has regularly contributed to the Texas Republican Party and to Republican candidates for federal office. None of the available records indicates donations to the state Democratic Party or to any Democratic candidate for federal office. However, O&#x27;Neill has claimed to have made large contributions to local Democratic candidates and supported Bill White and Ron Green for the nonpartisan positions of mayor and city councilmember, respectively, of the City of Houston. In this connection, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s name appears on an endorsement for Bill White.

O&#x27;Neill is a director of the conservative David Horowitz Freedom Center (formerly the Center for the Study of Popular Culture), co-founded by David Horowitz.

O&#x27;Neill sent a letter supporting Greg Parke, an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in Vermont in 2006. He has also endorsed the presidential campaign of Duncan Hunter.

<text>Ulva Island (from ) is a small island about long lying within Paterson Inlet, which is part of Stewart Island / Rakiura in New Zealand. 

==Geography==
It has an area of , of which almost all is part of Rakiura National Park. It was named after the island of Ulva in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, and was formerly called Coopers Island.

==Biodiversity==
Ulva Island&#x27;s relative isolation, but easy access from Stewart Island has allowed it to become an important natural resource area. It is a sanctuary for both birds and plants, holding species that on the mainland of New Zealand are rare or have died out. In 1997, the island was declared rat-free, following an eradication programme, and extirpated birds have been reintroduced to the island. The birds include the South Island saddleback (tīeke), yellowhead (mohua) and Stewart Island robin. Other birds on the island that are rare on the mainland include the Stewart Island subspecies of southern brown kiwi (tokoeka), rifleman (tititipounamu), yellow-crowned and red-fronted parakeet, and South Island kākā or forest parrot, as well as several other species. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin uses the island for breeding sites.

The shortest distance across the water from Rakiura to Ulva Island is around , and this is within the swimming range of Norway rats. There have been more than 20 rat incursions detected between 1997 and 2022. The gestation period of Norway rats is 3 weeks, so a population can build up quickly. In 2022, the Department of Conservation announced that a rat incursion in February had not been successfully contained, and that rats had spread to other parts of the island, posing a significant threat to the most vulnerable species on the island. The Predator Free Rakiura trust commented that the discovery of rats on Ulva Island provided support for the need to eradicate predators on mainland Rakiura.

The Department of Conservation currently maintains the public portion of the island including its predator free status. A small portion of the island (approximately between Sydney Cove and Post Office Bay) is privately owned.

The liverwort species &quot;Lophocolea mediinfrons&quot; is thought to be endemic to northeastern Ulva Island.

Ingraham is known for her support for Donald Trump and acted as an informal advisor during his presidency.
== Early life and education ==
Ingraham grew up in Glastonbury, Connecticut, where she was born to Anne Caroline (née Kozak) and James Frederick Ingraham III. Her maternal grandparents were Polish immigrants and her father was of Irish and English ancestry. She graduated from Glastonbury High School in 1981.

Ingraham studied English literature and Russian at Dartmouth College, graduating in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts. After college, Ingraham spent several years as a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s domestic policy advisor. She then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, where she was a notes editor for the &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot;. She graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1991.

==Career==

In the late 1980s, Ingraham worked as a speechwriter in the Reagan administration for the Domestic Policy Advisor. She also briefly served as editor of &quot;The Prospect&quot;, the magazine issued by Concerned Alumni of Princeton.

After graduating from law school in 1991, Ingraham was a law clerk for Judge Ralph K. Winter Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1991 to 1992 and for Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas from 1992 to 1993. She then worked as an attorney at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. In 1995, she appeared on the cover of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in connection with a story about young conservatives.

In 1996, she and Jay P. Lefkowitz organized the first Dark Ages Weekend in response to Renaissance Weekend.

===Television host===
Ingraham has had three stints as a cable television host. She first became a host on MSNBC in 1996. In the late 1990s, she became a CBS commentator and hosted the MSNBC program &quot;Watch It!&quot;. Several years later, on her radio program, Ingraham began campaigning for another cable television show. In 2008, Fox News Channel gave her a three-week trial run for a new show entitled &quot;Just In&quot;. In October 2017, she became the host of a new Fox News Channel program, &quot;The Ingraham Angle&quot;.

===Radio host===
Ingraham launched &quot;The Laura Ingraham Show&quot; in April 2001. The show was heard on 306 stations and on XM Satellite Radio. It was originally syndicated by Westwood One, but moved to Talk Radio Network in 2004. In 2012, Ingraham was rated as the No. 5 radio show in America by &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot;. In November 2012, she announced her departure from Talk Radio Network, declining to renew her contract with TRN after nearly a decade of being associated with the network. She was the second major host from TRN&#x27;s lineup to leave the network that year: TRN&#x27;s other major program, &quot;The Savage Nation&quot;, left TRN two months earlier. Her new program, syndicated by Courtside Entertainment Group, began airing on January 2, 2013, and went off the air in December 2018.

=== Books ===

* &quot;The Hillary Trap: Looking for Power in All the Wrong Places&quot;, first published June 2000 and updated in 2005, accuses Hillary Clinton of being a faux feminist whose &quot;liberal feminism has created a culture that rewards dependency, encourages fragmentation, undermines families, and celebrates victimhood&quot;.
* &quot;Shut Up &amp; Sing: How Elites from Hollywood, Politics, and the UN Are Subverting America&quot;, published October 25, 2003, decries liberal elites in politics, the media, academia, arts and entertainment, business, and international organizations, and praises Middle Americans as &quot;the kind of people who are the lifeblood of healthy democratic societies&quot;.
* &quot;Power to the People&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; number one best seller, published September 11, 2007, focuses on what Ingraham calls the &quot;pornification&quot; of America and stresses the importance of popular participation in culture, promoting conservative values in family life, education and patriotism.
* &quot;The Obama Diaries&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; number one best seller, published July 13, 2010, is a fictional collection of diary entries purportedly made by President Barack Obama, which Ingraham uses satirically to criticize Obama, his family, and his administration.
* &quot;Of Thee I Zing&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller, published July 12, 2011, is a collection of humorous anecdotes meant to point out the decline of American culture, from muffin tops to body shots.
* &quot;Billionaire at the Barricades&quot;, published 2017, explains the 2016 election victory of Donald Trump as the continuation of a populist revolution, initiated by Ronald Reagan, with working class support.

== Political views ==

Ingraham has been described as &quot;no stranger to generating controversy&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot; and as a &quot;name-brand provocateur&quot; by &quot;Politico&quot;. &quot;Business Insider&quot; has referred to Ingraham&#x27;s on-air style as &quot;wad[ing] into debates on racism and gun violence&quot;. Ingraham has said that her influences include Ronald Reagan, Robert Bork, and Pat Buchanan.

=== Homosexuality ===
In her senior year at Dartmouth College, during her tenure as editor-in-chief of independent campus newspaper &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;, Ingraham wrote several controversial articles. She sent a reporter undercover in 1984 to a campus Gay Students Association meeting, and later received criticism when, despite an oath of confidentiality being read to participants, Ingraham published a transcript of the meeting and included the names of the attendees, describing them as &quot;cheerleaders for latent campus sodomites&quot;. Ingraham argued that confidentiality did not apply because the meeting had been advertised, and defended the outing of the gay students as a &quot;freedom of the press issue&quot;. Jeffrey Hart, the faculty adviser for &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;, described Ingraham as having &quot;the most extreme anti-homosexual views imaginable&quot;, and said &quot;she went so far as to avoid a local eatery where she feared the waiters were homosexual&quot;.

In 1997, Ingraham wrote an essay in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which she stated that she had changed her views on homosexuality after witnessing &quot;the dignity, fidelity, and courage&quot; with which her gay brother, Curtis, and his partner coped with the latter being diagnosed with AIDS; Curtis&#x27;s partner ultimately died of the disease. Curtis, on the other hand, has called his sister &quot;a monster&quot; and said she was influenced by their father, whom he described as a Nazi sympathizer as well as an abusive alcoholic. Ingraham has stated that she supports civil unions between same-sex partners, but believes marriage &quot;is between a man and a woman&quot;.

=== Immigration and race ===
Ingraham is a frequent critic of immigration and has expressed anti-immigration views. She opposed the proposed bipartisan 2013 US Senate comprehensive immigration reform plan. In 2014, Ingraham said that allowing more immigrant workers to come to the United States would be &quot;obscene to the American experience&quot;. In 2014, she denounced House Majority Leader Eric Cantor after he expressed support for the DREAM Act and a GOP bill to grant a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants. At the time, Cantor faced a primary challenge from Dave Brat, which he would go on to lose. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Few people did more than Ms. Ingraham to propel Mr. Brat ... from obscurity to national conservative hero.&quot; Ingraham said the race would go &quot;down as one of the most significant repudiations of establishment immigration reform that I&#x27;ve seen in my 20 years of doing politics&quot;, and that due to the outcome of the race, &quot;immigration reform is DOA&quot;. That same year, Ingraham harshly criticized Republican congresswoman Renee Ellmers for expressing support for a comprehensive immigration bill which included a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who were in the country at the time. In an interview with Ellmers, Ingraham accused her of supporting amnesty and using liberal talking points, and said her arguments were &quot;infuriating to my listeners&quot;.

In September 2014, Ingraham claimed that then-President Barack Obama sent assistance to Africa during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and exposed Americans to the virus because of his guilt over &quot;colonialism&quot;.

In September 2017, amid reports that Trump was considering an agreement with Democrats on amnesty for approximately 800,000 DREAMers, Ingraham criticized him, tweeting &quot;When does American working class w/out real wage increase in 15yrs &amp; who send their kids to overcrowded public schools get amnesty?&quot; In July 2018, Ingraham harshly criticized Republican congressman Kevin Yoder after he expressed support for a Democratic bill that rolled back Attorney General Jeff Sessions&#x27; order that immigration judges not be allowed to grant asylum to asylum seekers fleeing domestic abuse or gang violence in their home country. She called on the congressman &quot;to stop selling out the Trump agenda&quot;.

In February 2018, Ingraham said NBA players LeBron James and Kevin Durant should &quot;shut up and dribble&quot; after James called comments by Trump &quot;laughable and scary&quot;. When her statement was criticized, Ingraham said there was no racial intent in her remarks and cited her 2003 book &quot;Shut Up &amp; Sing&quot; and other instances when she had said performers should &quot;shut up&quot; about politics. In 2020, when Drew Brees, a white athlete, criticized protesters who kneeled during the U.S. national anthem, Ingraham was criticized for supporting his statements, which she had not done in the earlier case with the African-American athletes.

Ingraham defended the Trump administration&#x27;s &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; family separation policy for children of illegal immigrants, and in a June 18, 2018, broadcast compared the children&#x27;s facilities to &quot;summer camps&quot; that &quot;resemble boarding schools&quot;. She further described criticism of the policy as &quot;faux liberal outrage&quot;. Ingraham had referred to the border crossings as &quot;slow-rolling invasion of the United States&quot;. School shooting survivor and activist David Hogg, who had led a previous campaign to pressure advertisers to leave &quot;The Ingraham Angle&quot;, called for a second boycott, but advertisers interviewed by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; on June 19 did not plan to leave the show.

==== Speculation on promoting the &quot;Great Replacement&quot; theory ====

Ingraham has objected to the changing racial demographics of The United States. In August 2018, she stated &quot;some parts of the country it does seem like the America we know and love doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. Massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people. And they&#x27;re changes that none of us ever voted for, and most of us don&#x27;t like... much of this is related to both illegal and, in some cases, legal immigration that, of course, progressives love.&quot;

Various commentators criticized Ingraham&#x27;s comments, with &quot;The Atlantic&quot; claiming she was alluding to the U.S. becoming &quot;less and less white with every passing year&quot;. Many outlets argued that it echoed white nationalist rhetoric or that itself constituted a &quot;white nationalist rant&quot;. Ingraham&#x27;s comments were endorsed by white supremacist and former Klansman David Duke. In response, Ingraham called Duke a &quot;racist freak whose name I won&#x27;t even mention&quot;. Some mainstream media described Ingraham&#x27;s views as advocating the white genocide conspiracy theory. In her August 9, 2018 &quot;Ingraham Angle&quot; monologue, Ingraham stated she was not talking about &quot;race or ethnicity&quot; and went on to say, &quot;There is something slipping away in this country and it&#x27;s not about race or ethnicity. It&#x27;s what was once a common understanding by both parties that American citizenship is a privilege, and one that at a minimum requires respect for the rule of law and loyalty to our constitution.&quot;

In October 2018, Ingraham urged her audience to vote Republican in the upcoming midterm elections, saying that Democrats &quot;want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever-increasing number of chain migrants.&quot;

In May 2019, Ingraham showed a graphic on her show of &quot;prominent voices censored on social media&quot;, which included &quot;people who believe in border enforcement, people who believe in national sovereignty.&quot; Among those listed was Paul Nehlen, known for making numerous anti-Semitic remarks, who was banned from Twitter after making racist remarks about Meghan Markle, the wife of Prince Harry.

In June 2019, she spread unsubstantiated claims that asylum seekers to the United States may carry the Ebola virus.

=== Economics ===
Ingraham has supported deregulation and has spoken against lawsuits. In 2021 Ingraham suggested getting rid of unemployment benefits for people capable of work. In September 2022, Ingraham criticized the Biden administration&#x27;s student loan forgiveness program, stating that her mother worked as a waitress until she was 73 to pay for Ingraham&#x27;s loans. Ingraham was criticized on Twitter with some asking why she let her mother work into her 70s to pay her debt, while she had held a number of high-paying positions in government, law and the media.

===Foreign policy ===
Ingraham advocated for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. However, during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, she said she considered the Iraq war a mistake, and criticized &quot;Bushism&quot; as Trump ran against Jeb Bush. In August 2019, Ingraham condemned China&#x27;s &quot;brutal violation of basic human rights&quot; and China&#x27;s Xinjiang internment camps for Muslim ethnic minority groups. Ingraham is a supporter of Israel, which she called &quot;one of our closest allies&quot;. She criticized Ilhan Omar&#x27;s description of Israel as an apartheid regime.

=== Donald Trump ===
Ingraham is known for her strong support for Donald Trump. During his presidency, she acted as an informal advisor to the administration, flouting journalistic ethical norms. In 2016 after Trump became the Republican nominee Ingraham expressed support for Trump during her speech at the Republican National Committee. In June 2019, Ingraham mocked reports that Trump had delayed his participation in D-Day commemoration activities to sit for an interview with her, strongly dismissing them as &quot;patently false—fake news&quot;, despite video of the interview showing Trump saying, &quot;These people are so amazing, and what they don&#x27;t realize is that I&#x27;m holding them up because of this interview, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s you.&quot;

==== January 6 United States Capitol attack conspiracy theories ====

Following the attack on the United States Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, Ingraham was among those who advanced the conspiracy theory that people associated with antifa were responsible. During the attack, she had texted Trump&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, &quot;Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.&quot; However, she downplayed Trump supporter involvement that evening on &quot;Ingraham Angle&quot;, stating, &quot;They were likely not all Trump supporters. I have never seen Trump rally attendees wearing helmets, black helmets, brown helmets, black backpacks — the uniforms you saw in some of these crowd shots.&quot; She later ridiculed four members of the Capitol Police and D.C. Police who had responded to the insurrection, after they testified to House lawmakers on July 27, 2021.

==== FBI search of Mar-a-Lago ====

In 2022, Ingraham criticized the Justice Department and FBI for the search of Trump&#x27;s private club and residence, Mar-a-Lago, over his handling of classified information, but suggested that Republican voters might &quot;turn the page&quot; and back another 2024 presidential candidate &quot;if we can get someone who has all Trump&#x27;s policies, who&#x27;s not Trump&quot;.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

==== Anti-vaccination conspiracy theories ====

During the coronavirus pandemic, Ingraham repeatedly questioned vaccine legitimacy, and instead pushed for the use of the unproven drug hydroxychloroquine as treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). She characterized it as a miracle drug and booked guests on her show to promote the drug. She mocked Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert R. Redfield after he cautioned against the drug. After a study was released which tested the drug on 368 Veterans Affairs patients and showed that the drug was associated with an increased risk of death, she attacked the study as &quot;shoddy&quot;, &quot;shockingly irresponsible&quot; and &quot;agenda-driven&quot;. She questioned whether attempts to &quot;disprove effectiveness&quot; of the drug was &quot;triggered by pure hatred of Trump? Of Fox? Of me?&quot; On June 15, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration revoked the Emergency Approval of hydroxychloroquine (and chloroquine). FDA said that a review of some studies showed that the drugs&#x27; potential benefits in treating COVID-19 did not outweigh the risks. Ingraham was an early media proponent of the anti-parasite drug ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 (a use not recommended by the FDA), and promoted a conspiracy theory that doctors and officials &quot;vilify and dismiss and demean, and, frankly, lie about it, the effectiveness of these drugs&quot;.

==== Other COVID-19 criticisms ====
In May 2020, Ingraham criticized requirements that people wear face masks in public as a way to halt the spread of the coronavirus.

She gave airtime to Harmeet Dhillon, a Republican operative who filed lawsuits against California to stop the implementation of stay-at-home orders intended to halt the spread of the coronavirus. She praised her as &quot;leading the charge to keep Gavin Newsom&#x27;s power grabs in check.&quot;

In October 2020, Ingraham and her guest Victor Davis Hanson spread misinformation about New Zealand&#x27;s response to the pandemic on her show. Referring to a &quot;terrifying new response&quot; which was months old, she called New Zealand&#x27;s managed isolation facilities &quot;camps&quot; when they are in fact lavish hotels.

=== Gun issues ===

Ingraham warned Trump not to support gun control; after comments he made in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Ingraham said in a February 2018 tweet that &quot;If the President @realDonaldTrump dives on the 2nd [Amendment], he won&#x27;t have to worry abt who runs his 2020 campaign.&quot;

==== Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and cyberbullying accusations ====

In March 2018, Ingraham&#x27;s show was boycotted by 27 sponsors after she ridiculed David Hogg, a 17-year-old student survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, for supposedly complaining about being rejected by four colleges. In response, Hogg posted a list of Ingraham&#x27;s advertisers and called for a boycott, accusing her of cyberbullying. After several advertisers left the show Ingraham apologized, which Hogg dismissed as insincere. Advertising time during the show dropped by as much as 52 percent. After Ingraham returned from a vacation following the boycott, her program earned its best ratings ever, spiking 25% in total viewers and saw an increase of 36% in the key 25–54 age group demographic. As of October 2018, companies were continuing to shun Ingraham&#x27;s show despite the increased ratings.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
Ingraham has promoted conspiracy theories about topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

Ingraham has promoted the Great Replacement theory and stated that Democrats &quot;want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever-increasing number of chain migrants&quot;. Ingraham also hosted Republicans Jim Banks, Stephen Miller, and Jim Jordan who also endorsed the theory.

During an appearance on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; Ingraham promoted the conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee was involved in the murder of Seth Rich.

==Personal life==
Ingraham attended a Baptist church until the age of twelve, later converting to Roman Catholicism. She studied Spanish and Russian.

Ingraham has dated George Conway and Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, fellow conservatives.

In April 2005, Ingraham announced that she had undergone treatment for breast cancer.

She is a single parent of three children: a girl, Maria, from Guatemala adopted in 2008; a boy, Michael Dmitri, from Russia adopted in 2009; and a second boy, Nikolai Peter, adopted from Russia in 2011.

<text>Tomáš Halík (; born 1 June 1948) is a Czech Catholic priest, philosopher, and theologian. He is a professor of sociology at the Charles University in Prague, pastor of the Academic Parish by St. Salvator Church in Prague, and president of the Czech Christian Academy. 

Since 1989, Halík has lectured at universities and international scientific conferences in Europe, the United States, Asia, Australia, Canada, and Southern Africa. He was also a visiting professor at Oxford University, Cambridge University and Harvard University.

He is an author of several books on religion and spirituality and a recipient of numerous awards and prizes including the Templeton Prize, Romano Guardini Prize and an honorary degree from Oxford University. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI granted him the title of Monsignor Honorary Prelate of His Holiness.

As an active member of religious and cultural dissent during Communist era, Halík was appointed by Pope John Paul II as an advisor to the Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers in 1992. In the Saint Salvator Church in Prague, he often holds joint prayers and meditations with members of other religions such as Jews, Buddhists, and Muslims. Due to his views on the other religions, his support for registered partnerships (but not gay marriage), and his stance on immigration, he has received both praise and criticism.

==Biography==
===Communist era===
Halík converted to Catholicism at 18 years old, due to the influence of writers like G. K. Chesterton and Graham Greene. He studied Sociology and Philosophy at Charles University, in Prague, then Czechoslovakia, where he was a student of Jan Patočka. He moved briefly abroad to study English at the University of Wales, in Bangor, where he was surprised by the Soviet-led invasion of his country, meant to crush the Prague Spring, in August 1968. He returned to Prague, where he graduated in 1972. He did a speech at his doctoral graduation ceremony that was deemed subversive by the Communist regime, which banned him from teaching or holding any academic position. He then worked as a psychotherapist, from 1972 to 1975. He held the chair of Psychology of Work for the Institute of the Ministry of Labour, from 1975 to 1984. Meanwhile, Halík clandestinely studied Theology in Prague, and on 21 August 1978, was secretly ordained as a Roman Catholic priest at Erfurt, East Germany. He studied and received a post degree in Psychology from the Institute of Medicine in Prague in 1984. He worked as a psychotherapist for drug addicts and alcoholics at the clinic for cure of addictions of the Charles University, in Prague, from 1984 to 1990. In the 1980s he was active in the &quot;underground church&quot; and was a close associate of Cardinal František Tomášek, before the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989.

===Democratic regime===
After the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot;, which meant the triumph of democracy in his country, he was one of the external advisers of Czech president Václav Havel. Pope John Paul II appointed him as an adviser to the Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers in 1992. He licenciated in Theology at the Pontifical Lateran University, in Rome, in 1992. The same year he took a higher doctorate in Sociology from Charles University and ThDr.hab. in theology at the Pontifical Faculty of Theology in Wrocław, Poland. Halík joined the Sociology Faculty at his alma-mater in 1993 and became a professor in 1997. He is also the head of the Religious Studies Department. As a visiting fellow, he held lectureships at both Oxford University and Cambridge University, in England. Hálik is the rector of the Church of the Holy Saviour, in Prague, since 1990, and co-founder and longtime President of the Czech Christian Academy. Pope Benedict XVI nominated him monsignor, as an honorary prelate of the pope, in 2008.

He often publicly discusses ethical issues, such as racism, political and religious intolerance, the process of secularisation, as well as the process of European expansion and integration.

Tomáš Halík is a member of several scientific societies, including the European Society for Catholic Theology, the International Society for the Psychology of Religion, and Washington-based Czechoslovak Society for Science and the Arts.

In 2010, his book &quot;Patience with God&quot; (&quot;Vzdáleným nablízku: vášeň a trpělivost v setkání víry s nevírou&quot;) was named book of the month by the &quot;U.S. Catholic&quot; Book Club and was awarded Europe&#x27;s best theological book prize.

Halík has publicly speculated a run for the Czech presidency. In 2015, Zdeněk Škromach announced he would run, to which Halík had said the year earlier that, if there were no candidates worthy, naming Škromach as one such candidate, he would have a moral obligation to run. However, in early 2016, he stated that he believed the office of president no longer appealed to him, as &quot;it is the time for demagogues&quot; such as the current Czech President Miloš Zeman and Donald Trump. He also did not believe he had high chances of succeeding in the 2018 race, as he would have only won &quot;the voices of the sane and educated&quot;, believing that he would need to go against his moral compass and campaign on a populist and controversial platform.

==Controversial views==
Halík holds some controversial, even dissident views, that are at odds with the official stances of the Catholic Church. He supports women&#x27;s ordination and has criticized his church&#x27;s stance on homosexuality, stating that people with same-sex attraction shouldn&#x27;t be compelled to live in chastity. He has been supportive of the LGBTQ+ Catholic group New Ways Ministry and has agreed to host gay rights demonstrations in his parish church. 

Halik also has criticized anti-abortion legislation, specially in Eastern Europe, claiming that the near-total ban on abortion in Poland would &quot;encourage ‘abortion tourism’ of Polish women to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, contributing very little to the protection of the unborn and failing to actually stop the evil of abortion.&quot; In an interview given at 6 March 2024, he openly opposes the criminalization of abortion: &quot;We need to learn to function in a pluralistic society; come to terms with the fact that in the legal system of a secular state there is no place for the criminalization of abortion; come to terms with the legalisation of same-sex unions.&quot;

<doc id="938586" wikidata="Q1426250" url="?curid=938586" title="Creativity techniques">
<text>Creativity techniques are methods that encourage creative actions, whether in the arts or sciences. They focus on a variety of aspects of creativity, including techniques for idea generation and divergent thinking, methods of re-framing problems, changes in the affective environment and so on. They can be used as part of problem solving, artistic expression, or therapy.

Some techniques require groups of two or more people while other techniques can be accomplished alone. These methods include word games, written exercises and different types of improvisation, or algorithms for approaching problems. Aleatory techniques exploiting randomness are also common.

==Aleatory techniques==

Aleatoricism is the incorporation of chance (random elements) into the process of creation, especially the creation of art or media. Aleatoricism is commonly found in music, art, and literature, particularly in poetry. In film, Andy Voda made a movie in 1979 called &quot;Chance Chants&quot;, which he produced by a flip of a coin or roll of a dice. In music, John Cage, an avant-garde musician, composed music by using the &quot;I Ching&quot; to determine the position of musical notes, superimposing star maps on blank sheet music, by rolling dice and preparing open-ended scores that depended on the spontaneous decisions of the performers. Other ways of practicing randomness include coin tossing, picking something out of a hat, or selecting random words from a dictionary. 

The aleatory approach is also demonstrated in the case of the process called provocation, which was initially introduced by Edward de Bono as an aid to research. This method, which Richard Restak said was also employed by Anthony Burgess, aims to achieve novel ideas in writing by directing a plot with creative connections through random words picked from a reference book. Restak explained that the two hundred billion interconnected neural cells in the brain are capable of an abundance of possibilities for long-range connections and creative interactions using random and unrelated words.

==Improvisation==

Improvisation is a creative process which can be spoken, written, or composed without prior preparation.
Improvisation, also called extemporization, can lead to the discovery of new ways to act, new patterns of thought and practices, or new structures. Improvisation is used in the creation of music, theater, and other various forms. Many artists also use improvisational techniques to help their creative flow.

The following are two significant domains that use improvisation:

* Improvisational theater is a form of theater in which actors use improvisational acting techniques to perform spontaneously. Many improvisational (&quot;improv&quot;) techniques are taught in standard drama classes. The basic skills of listening, clarity, confidence, and performing instinctively and spontaneously are considered important skills for actors to develop.
* Free improvisation is real-time composition. Musicians of all kinds improvise (&quot;improv&quot;) music; such improvised music is not limited to a particular genre. Two contemporary musicians that use free improvisation are Anthony Braxton and Cecil Taylor.

==In problem solving==

In problem-solving contexts, the random-word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method. A person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word, in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem. A random image, sound, or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or .

There are many problem-solving tools and methodologies to support creativity:

* TRIZ (theory which are derived from tools such as ARIZ or TRIZ contradiction matrix)
* Creative problem solving process (CPS) (complex strategy, also known as Osborn-Parnes-process)
* Lateral thinking process, of Edward de Bono
* Six Thinking Hats, of Edward de Bono
* Ordinal priority approach
* Herrmann brain dominance instrument – right brain / left brain
* Brainstorming and brainwriting
* Think outside the box
* Business war games, for the resolution of competitive problems 
* SWOT analysis
* USIT method of convergent creativity
* Thought experiment
* Five Ws

==In project management==
For project management purposes, group creativity techniques are creativity techniques used by a team in the course of executing a project. Some relevant techniques are brainstorming, the nominal group technique, the Delphi technique, idea/mind mapping, the affinity diagram, and multicriteria decision analysis. These techniques are referenced in the &quot;Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge&quot;.

Group creativity techniques can be used in a sequence; for example:
# Gather requirements using idea/mind mapping
# Continue generating ideas by brainstorming
# Construct an affinity diagram based on the generated ideas
# Identify the most important ideas by applying the nominal group technique

===Distraction===
Multiple studies have confirmed that distraction actually increases creative cognition. One such study done by Jonathan Schooler found that non-demanding distractions improve performance on a classic creativity task called the UUT (Unusual Uses Task) in which the subject must come up with as many possible uses for a common object. The results confirmed that decision-related neural processes occur during moments of unconscious thought while a person engages in a non-demanding task. The research showed that while distracted, a subject isn’t maintaining one thought for a particularly long time, which in turn allows different ideas to float in and out of one’s consciousness—this sort of associative process leads to creative incubation.

Ambient noise is another variable that is conducive to distraction. It has been proven that a moderate level of noise actually heightens creativity. Professor Ravi Mehta conducted a study to research the degree of distraction induced by various noise levels and their effect on creativity. The series of experiments show that a moderate level of ambient noise (70 dB) produces just enough distraction to induce processing disfluency, which leads to abstract cognition. These higher construal levels caused by moderate levels of noise consequently enhance creativity.

===Walking===
In 2014, a study found that walking increased creativity.

===Sleep and relaxation===

Some advocate enhancing creativity by taking advantage of hypnagogia, the transition from wakefulness to sleep, using techniques such as lucid dreaming. One technique used by Salvador Dalí was to drift off to sleep in an armchair with a set of keys in his hand; when he fell completely asleep, the keys would fall and wake him up, allowing him to recall his mind&#x27;s subconscious imaginings. Thomas Edison used the same technique, with ball bearings.

===Meditation===

A study from 2014 involving 40 Chinese undergraduates found that performing a 30 minute meditation session each day, for seven days, was sufficient to improve verbal and visual creativity, as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, due to the positive effects of meditation on emotional regulation. The same researchers also showed in 2015 that short term meditation training could also improve insight-based problem solving (the type commonly associated with an &quot;ah-ha&quot; or &quot;eureka&quot; type moment of realization) as measured by the Remote Associates Test.

<text>South Mimms is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of South Mimms and Ridge, in the borough of Hertsmere in Hertfordshire in the East of England. It is a small settlement located near the junction of the M25 motorway with the A1(M) motorway. In 2011 the parish had a population of 855.

==History==

South Mimms parish is the northernmost part of the historic county of Middlesex. The name is thought to derive from the name of a tribe who once inhabited the area. Potters Bar was originally a small settlement in the parish. Potters Bar became the location of the nearest railway station (originally known as Potters Bar and South Mimms) and eventually became much larger. 

The parish was split in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894 with the extreme southern tip forming South Mimms Urban parish in the Barnet Urban District and was transferred to Hertfordshire. This area now forms part of the London Borough of Barnet. The rest of the parish became the South Mimms Rural District, later renamed the Potters Bar Urban District. 

Potters Bar and South Mimms were transferred to Hertfordshire in 1965 instead of becoming part of Greater London.

The Grange, a country house in South Mimms, served as a home for Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands during her exile during World War II, from 1940. On 20 February 1944, a German air attack on South Mimms narrowly missed her, killing two of her guards, an incident mentioned in her autobiography. This prompted her move to a house near Reading.

Dancers Hill in South Mimms was the location of a World War II prisoner-of-war camp, Camp 33, that consisted of two compounds, both providing tented accommodation for prisoners.

Richmond Thackeray, father of William Makepeace Thackeray, was born in the parish and baptised in the church in 1781.

Clare Hall Manor, a former private residence, became a tuberculosis sanatorium and then a research laboratory.

On 1 April 2023 the civil parish of South Mimms was merged with the neighbouring parish of Ridge to form a single parish called &quot;South Mimms and Ridge&quot;, combining within a single parish areas which had earlier been part of Middlesex and Hertfordshire respectively.

There is now only one public house, the Black Horse. The White Hart, adjacent to the church, remains closed and the future use of the site is uncertain. Both buildings date from the 18th century and are Grade II listed.

==St Giles&#x27; Church, South Mimms==
The Grade I listed parish church of South Mimms (usually spelt “Mymms” in this context) is dedicated to Saint Giles. It is situated on the west side of the village. It has a chancel with north vestry and chapel, nave with north aisle and south porch, and west tower. Except for the north aisle and chapel, which are partly of brick, the walls are of flint rubble with stone dressings.

The chancel, or at least its western part, is of the 13th century; the east end may be an extension of the earlier 14th century, the date of the east window. It is not structurally divided from the nave, which appears to have been rebuilt at the end of the 14th century, the date of the windows and doorway in the south wall. The three-stage tower was added &quot;c&quot;. 1450 and has a western doorway and an external stair turret. The north chapel and aisle, with their arcades of two and four bays, were built in the early 16th century and the latter was apparently complete by 1526, when the stained glass windows depicting its donors were in place. The whole church appears to have been richly provided with stained glass of the medieval period. The chapel, which may be a little older than the aisle, is enclosed by wooden screens decorated with the leopard&#x27;s head badge of Frowyk. There was formerly a late medieval rood screen.

The chancel was in disrepair in 1685, when it was ordered that the communion table be railed in. By the 18th century all the medieval glass, except the lower part of four panels in the north aisle, had gone and the chancel, nave, and aisle had flat plaster ceilings. Then the walls and the screens of the Frowyk chapel were all whitewashed. There was a gallery for children at the west end, extending some way along both sides of the nave, and there were box pews, a lofty pulpit, and a reading desk. The royal arms were &#x27;placed where the rood had been&#x27;. Externally, the south porch was of classical design and the tower was covered in ivy.

The lead roof of the nave was replaced by slates in 1823 and the gabled roof of the chantry by a flat leaded roof and a battlement before 1849. In 1846 a flint-and-brick wall was built at the west end of the church and Lord Salisbury, as lay rector, was asked to repair the chancel. In 1848 he still had not done so and the vestry resolved on legal proceedings. By 1876 the fabric was causing concern and the vestry accordingly appointed George Edmund Street to carry out a complete restoration. The church was re-opened in 1878, after the plaster had been stripped from the exterior, a south porch built, and a battlement added to the south wall to give height to the nave. Inside, the lath-and-plaster ceilings were taken out but the timber roof of the aisle was preserved; whitewash and white paint were removed, the box pews were replaced by oak ones based on the design of two which had survived from the 16th century, and a stone pulpit and an oak roodloft were installed. No stained glass had been introduced into the church since 1541, but in 1889 the central light of the east window was filled with Munich glass and in 1894 more stained glass was inserted.

In 1552 the church possessed a pair of organs. A barrel organ had been introduced in 1813, although the innovation was not welcomed by all the parishioners, and a new organ was built in the chantry in 1889. The square baptismal font dates from the 13th century and has 14th-century panelling on the pier. Its cover, designed by Sir Ninian Comper in 1938, is supported on four gilt pillars.

The notable collection of monuments includes 15th- to 18th-century brasses to members of the Frowyk, Ewer, Harrison, Hodsden, and Ketterick families, including one commemorating Thomas Frowyk (d. 1448), his wife, and nineteen children. Wall-monuments include an early-17th-century memorial, with a death&#x27;s-head and carrying the arms of the Nowell family, and memorials to William Adams by Thomas Denman and Mary Dakin by William Spratt. There are 17th-century floor-slabs to the families of Norbury, Marsh, Howkins, Adderley, and Ewer, and a canopied altar-tomb with some Renaissance features, perhaps that of Henry Frowyk (d. 1527). In the north chapel there is a canopied tomb in an earlier style bearing the arms of Frowyk impaled with those of Throckmorton, Aske, Knollys, and Lewknor, and with an effigy of a man in armour adorned with the Frowyk leopard&#x27;s head; it is probably that of Henry&#x27;s son Thomas, who died by 1527. The churchyard contains a large monument to Sir John Austen, MP (d. 1742). Its entry gate is dedicated to Dr. Frederick Brittain (1893-1969), a distinguished classical scholar and former Churchwarden.

==South Mimms Castle==
The remains of a motte and bailey castle are situated 1.25 kilometres northwest of the village, consisting of a circular mound about 9 metres high by 35 m across, in the corner of a kidney-shaped inner bailey about 125 m long. Traces of an outer bailey survive to the south of the site. The castle is thought to have been built by Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex in about 1141 during The Anarchy, a period of civil war between the forces of the Empress Matilda and those of King Stephen. The site was only identified in 1918 and was excavated in 1960-67 by Dr John Kent. These works found that the wooden keep, a large framed tower with tapered sides, had been built on the natural ground level and the motte had been piled up against it afterwards, using spoil from the ditch. The sides of the motte had originally been revetted with wood, so that only a timber wall would have been visible. Entrance to the tower was through a tunnel at the base of the motte. The castle was probably destroyed in 1143, but finds at the site suggest that occupation continued for a time afterwards. The castle remains are on private land and there is no public access, although a public footpath runs close to the site.

<text>The Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana is a coastal feature of the North Island of New Zealand. It has an area of 4000 km2, and lies between, in anticlockwise order, the Auckland Region, the Hauraki Plains, the Coromandel Peninsula, and Great Barrier Island. Most of the gulf is part of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park.

Hauraki is Māori for &quot;north wind&quot;. In 2014, the gulf was officially named Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;the mournful sea&quot; for . In traditional legend, the Hauraki Gulf is protected by a taniwha named Ureia, who takes the form of a whale.

==Geography==

The gulf is part of the Pacific Ocean, which it joins to the north and east. It is largely protected from the Pacific by Great Barrier Island and Little Barrier Island to the north, and by the 80-kilometre-long Coromandel Peninsula to the east. It is thus well protected against all but northern winds.

Three large channels join the gulf to the Pacific. Colville Channel lies between the Coromandel Peninsula and Great Barrier, Cradock Channel lies between the two islands, and Jellicoe Channel lies between Little Barrier and the North Auckland Peninsula. To the north of Auckland several peninsulas jut into the gulf, notably the Whangaparāoa Peninsula. Tiritiri Matangi Island is near the end of this peninsula. Further north, Kawau Island nestles under the Tawharanui Peninsula.

Numerous beaches dot the shores of the gulf, many of them well known for swimming and surfing.

During the last glaciation period the gulf was dry land, with the sea level being around 100–110 m (300 ft) lower than at present. The gulf was submerged when the sea reached its current level around 7200 years ago. During this period, the area was home to two river systems. The first of these was a river formed by two tributaries, the Mahurangi River and Waitematā Harbour (then a river) acting as tributaries. This river flowed north-east between modern day Little Barrier Island and Great Barrier Island, and emptied into the Pacific Ocean north of Great Barrier Island. The second was a stream formed by the major Hauraki Plains rivers: the Waihou River, Piako River and Waitakaruru River. Prior to the Oruanui eruption 27,000 years ago, the Waikato River also flowed into the Hauraki Gulf at the Firth of Thames. The Hauraki Plains rivers were met by two tributaries, the Wairoa River to the west from modern-day Clevedon and the Umangawha Stream to the east, at Colville, Coromandel Peninsula. This river flowed north, along the plains, turning east and exiting towards the Pacific Ocean along the modern-day Colville Channel between the Coromandel Peninsula and Great Barrier Island.

===Islands===

In the west of the gulf lie a string of islands guarding the mouth of the Waitematā Harbour, one of Auckland&#x27;s two harbours. These include Ponui Island, Waiheke Island, Tiritiri Matangi and the iconic dome of Rangitoto Island (a dormant volcano), which is connected to the much older Motutapu Island by a causeway. The islands are separated from the mainland by the Tamaki Strait and Rangitoto Channel.

Other islands in the gulf include Browns Island, Motuihe Island, Pakihi Island, Pakatoa Island, Rakino Island, and Rotoroa Island in the inner gulf, around Waiheke and Rangitoto; Tarahiki Island just east of Waiheke; Motukawao Islands and Whanganui Island in the lee of the Coromandel Peninsula; and Channel Island in the outer gulf.

In March 2020, a small excavation was carried out in a large coastal midden on Otata Island. In January 2018, huge swells in the Hauraki Gulf caused widespread damage to its coastal areas and in only a few hours, the coastline or Otata had been reduced by up to 5 meters, exposing the midden. The aim of the excavation was to record this information before it is lost to erosion and was carried out in partnership with Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, the landowners. An understanding the changing marine environment around the island will also form part of the work.

===Firth of Thames===
At the southern end of the gulf is the wide, relatively shallow Firth of Thames. Beyond this lie the Hauraki Plains, drained by the Waihou River and the Piako River. The Hunua Ranges and hills of the Coromandel Peninsula rise on either side of the Firth.

==History==

Traditional Tāmaki Māori histories describe the naming of the gulf. The migratory canoes &quot;Tainui&quot; and &quot;Arawa&quot; left Raiatea at similar times, and both explored the Bay of Plenty area. The crew of both canoes met at Horuhoru Rock (Gannet Rock), where a ceremony was held in memory for the relatives they had lost on the journey. During the ceremony, a mauri stone brought with them on their voyage named Tīkapa was placed on the island. The name Tīkapa Moana was adopted for the surrounding ocean, and became the name of the gulf.

==Ecology==

===Species===
Some particular common or known animals include bottlenose and common dolphins, the latter sometimes seen in &quot;super schools&quot; of 300-500 animals or more, while various species of whales and orcas are a relatively common sight. There are approximately 25 species of marine mammals in the gulf. Nearly a third of the world&#x27;s marine mammal species live in or visit the Marine Park.Among larger cetaceans, Bryde&#x27;s whales are residents and relatively common in the Gulf, and their presence in these busily travelled waters leads to a large number of ship strikes, with sometimes several of the whales dying each year from collisions with shipping vessels or sport boats. The population remaining is estimated to be between 100-200. In recent years, increases in numbers of migrating baleen whales are confirmed long after the end of hunting era. These are humpback whales, southern blue whales, pygmy blue whales, and southern minke whales. Less frequently, fin whales and sei whales are seen as well. For southern right whales, these whales will possibly become seasonal residents in the gulf as the populations recover (one of two of the first confirmed birth records on New Zealand&#x27;s main islands since after commercial and illegal whalings were recorded at around Milford and Browns Bay in 2012). Sperm whales visit occasionally.

Many of the islands are official or unofficial bird sanctuaries, holding important or critically endangered species like kiwi, takahē, brown teal and grey-faced petrel. Centred on the main conservation island of Tiritiri Matangi and Little Barrier Island, numerous bird species that were locally extinct have been reintroduced in the last decades, while there have also been some naturally occurring bird &quot;re-colonisations&quot;, especially after introduced pests were removed from breeding and nesting grounds.

===Environmental damage===
The gulf is a vibrant natural environment, which has seen significant damage during the 20th and early 21st century from human use. Although major study by the Hauraki Gulf Forum in 2011 found that all environmental indicators were still worsening or stable at problematic levels, voluntary coast clean-up groups have collected about 450,000 litres of litter collected from the shoreline, although further conservation efforts are required to maintain the environmental integrity of the gulf.

Particularly damaging were the introduction of industrialised fishing, with for example snapper fishing peaking in the 1970s at more than 10,000 tonnes a year (though even in the 2000s, private fishing of this species is also a considerable factor, weighing in at 400–800 tonnes a year). This severe overfishing, which unbalanced the marine environment by the removal of a main predator in the food chain, led to further degradation, such as a widespread disappearance of kelp beds as they were overtaken by kina barrens. Trawler fishing in general is seen as severely damaging the gulf, and lobster stock are also reported as not rebuilding. It is estimated that today&#x27;s fish stocks are around 25% of pre-European levels.

Also particularly damaging are the results of nitrogen carried into the gulf from surrounding agricultural land, with almost 90% coming from the dairy-farming runoff into the Firth of Thames.

Other exploitation such as the dredging of the mussel beds of the Firth of Thames, reaching its height in 1961 with an estimated 15 million mussels taken (shortly before collapse of the industry) have led to damage which has not been recovered from forty years later, possibly due to the dredging having destroyed the seafloor, and sediment drainage from the agriculture in the Firth of Thames affecting the mussel&#x27;s viability.

Numerous beaches dot the shores of the gulf, many of them well known for swimming and surfing. Although environmental problems exist around urban areas, with 14 out of 52 beaches in the Auckland Region at least occasionally showing unsafe pollution levels (mostly because of untreated sewage) for bathing, environmental groups are working to clean the beaches and restore their vitality.

==Marine Park==
===Legal establishment===
Sections 7 and 8 of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park Act 2000 state:

7 Recognition of national significance of Hauraki Gulf
*(1) The interrelationship between the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments and the ability of that interrelationship to sustain the life-supporting capacity of the environment of the Hauraki Gulf and its islands are matters of national significance.
*(2) The life-supporting capacity of the environment of the Gulf and its islands includes the capacity—
**(a) to provide for—
***(i) the historic, traditional, cultural, and spiritual relationship of the tangata whenua of the Gulf with the Gulf and its islands; and
***(ii) the social, economic, recreational, and cultural well-being of people and communities:
**(b) to use the resources of the Gulf by the people and communities of the Gulf and New Zealand for economic activities and recreation:
**(c) to maintain the soil, air, water, and ecosystems of the Gulf.
8 Management of Hauraki Gulf
: To recognise the national significance of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments, the objectives of the management of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments are—
*(a) the protection and, where appropriate, the enhancement of the life-supporting capacity of the environment of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments:
*(b) the protection and, where appropriate, the enhancement of the natural, historic, and physical resources of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments:
*(c) the protection and, where appropriate, the enhancement of those natural, historic, and physical resources (including kaimoana) of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments with which tangata whenua have an historic, traditional, cultural, and spiritual relationship:
*(d) the protection of the cultural and historic associations of people and communities in and around the Hauraki Gulf with its natural, historic, and physical resources:
*(e) the maintenance and, where appropriate, the enhancement of the contribution of the natural, historic, and physical resources of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments to the social and economic well-being of the people and communities of the Hauraki Gulf and New Zealand:
*(f) the maintenance and, where appropriate, the enhancement of the natural, historic, and physical resources of the Hauraki Gulf, its islands, and catchments, which contribute to the recreation and enjoyment of the Hauraki Gulf for the people and communities of the Hauraki Gulf and New Zealand.

===Significance===
The park is distinctly different from other conservation areas of New Zealand not only by being a marine environment, but because it is home to more than one million people along its shores and on its islands. It also contains a number of (above-water) wildlife sanctuaries.

<doc id="938598" wikidata="Q763064" url="?curid=938598" title="Coromandel Peninsula">
<text>The Coromandel Peninsula () on the North Island of New Zealand extends north from the western end of the Bay of Plenty, forming a natural barrier protecting the Hauraki Gulf and the Firth of Thames in the west from the Pacific Ocean to the east. It is wide at its broadest point. Almost its entire population lives on the narrow coastal strips fronting the Hauraki Gulf and the Bay of Plenty. In clear weather the peninsula is clearly visible from Auckland, the country&#x27;s biggest city, which lies on the far shore of the Hauraki Gulf, to the west. The peninsula is part of the Thames-Coromandel District and the Waikato Region.

==Names==
The Māori name for the peninsula is &quot;Te Tara-o-te-Ika-a-Māui&quot;, meaning &quot;the barb of Māui&#x27;s fish&quot;. This comes from the legend of Māui and the Fish, in which the demigod uses his hook to catch a great fish (Te Ika-a-Māui or the North Island) from the depths of the Pacific Ocean. In Hauraki Māori tradition, the fish is likened to a stingray, with the Wellington Region being its head, the Northland Peninsula its tail, and Coromandel Peninsula its barb or spine.

The English-language name for the peninsula comes from HMS &quot;Coromandel&quot; (originally named HMS &quot;Malabar&quot;), a ship of the British Royal Navy that stopped at Coromandel Harbour in 1820 to buy kauri spars. The ship was named for the Coromandel Coast of India.

==Geography==
The peninsula is steep and hilly and largely covered in bush. The Coromandel Range forms the spine for most of the peninsula, with the Moehau Range at the northern end providing the highest point at nearly . The large Great Barrier Island, which lies beyond the northern tip, can be thought of as an extension of the ranges. The island is separated from Cape Colville on the peninsula&#x27;s northern coast by the Colville Channel.

Although the peninsula is close to large centres of population such as Auckland to the west and Tauranga to the southeast, its rugged nature means that much of it is relatively isolated, and the interior and northern tip are both largely undeveloped and sparsely inhabited. The Coromandel Forest Park covers much of the inland part of the peninsula.

Numerous small islands and island groups lie offshore, such as the Motukawao Islands to the northwest, the Aldermen Islands and Slipper Island to the southeast, and the Mercury Islands to the northeast.

The peninsula shows considerable signs of past volcanism. It comprises the eroded remnants of the Coromandel Volcanic Zone, which was highly active during the Miocene and Pliocene periods. Volcanic activity has since primarily shifted southeast to the Taupo Volcanic Zone, although Mayor Island some 25 km to the east was recently active. Geothermal activity is still present on the peninsula, with hot springs in several places, notably at Hot Water Beach (in the central east coast between Whitianga and Tairua) and near Te Aroha.

==People==
Owing to the nature of the land, much of the Coromandel&#x27;s population clusters in a small number of towns and communities along the southeastern and southwestern coasts. Only five towns have populations of over 1000 (Coromandel, Whitianga, Thames, Tairua, and Whangamatā), and of these only Thames, with people, and Whitianga, with people, have populations of over 5000. Several small towns dot the coast of the Firth of Thames in the southwest. Other small towns on the peninsula include Te Puru, Matarangi, Whangapoua, Whiritoa, Hikuai, Port Jackson, Port Charles, Tairua, Pauanui and Colville. The population of several of these centres is highly seasonal, with many Aucklanders having holiday homes in the Coromandel. During the summer holiday period around Christmas and New Year, visiting families and travellers from around the North Island add significantly to activity in the area, particularly in Whangamatā, Whitianga, Matarangi, Tairua and Pauanui.

The peninsula is a popular place to live for people who have chosen an alternative lifestyle, especially those who have left Auckland. The 1970s saw thousands of hippies relocate from large cities around New Zealand to the Coromandel in search of an environmentally friendly lifestyle associated with the counterculture back-to-the-land movement. , increasing numbers of affluent Aucklanders have started moving to the Coromandel.

Population density decreases with both distance from the coast and distance north. Of the main population centres, only Coromandel, Colville, Matarangi and Whitianga lie in the north of the peninsula, and much of the inland parts remain virtually uninhabited.

==History==
Prior to contact with Europeans, the Tahanga Quarries of Opito Bay were an important source of basalt (&quot;karā&quot; or &quot;pakawera&quot;), which Māori used in the production of stone tools such as adzes (particularly during the Māori Archaic period (1300–1500)).

==Industries and attractions==
The area was once known largely for its hard-rock gold mining and kauri forestry industries, but is now a popular tourist destination. Most mining ceased around the 1980s. In late 2009, New Zealand&#x27;s Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee (National Party) noted that there was a possibility of new mining in conservation areas, even though he had previously declared that a stocktake of mineral resources in protected areas did not indicate a desire to mine there.

A forest park occupies much of the centre of the peninsula, and the coasts are dotted with numerous beaches and scenic views. Evidence of the region&#x27;s geothermal origins can be found in hot springs, notably at Hot Water Beach on the peninsula&#x27;s east coast. The town of Whangamatā is a popular holiday retreat, and Whitianga on Mercury Bay is renowned for its yachting. The peninsula&#x27;s waters are also a popular destination for scuba divers. Cathedral Cove, named for its cathedral-like arch through the limestone cliff, is a popular destination, only accessible by boat or on foot. In recent years, dolphins and more coast-loving whales are appearing along the coasts as their numbers began to recover, such as southern right whale, Bryde&#x27;s whale and humpback whale.

==Transport==
The towns are connected by State Highways 25 and 25A, which form a circuit around the peninsula. Not all of the roads on the peninsula are sealed (i.e. are gravel roads) notably the 309 Road, which connects Coromandel Town and Whitianga. Some hire car companies have contracts that specifically exclude driving on these roads. A passenger ferry runs from Ferry Landing to Whitianga, providing direct access to the shops and restaurants of Whitianga for pedestrians and cyclists based in Cook&#x27;s Beach, Flaxmill Bay, Front Beach, and Ferry Landing. The ferry takes only 5 minutes to cross the harbour, while the trip by road takes 40 to 45 minutes.

<doc id="938602" wikidata="Q1412443" url="?curid=938602" title="Signal (IPC)">
<text>Signals are standardized messages sent to a running program to trigger specific behavior, such as quitting or error handling. They are a limited form of inter-process communication (IPC), typically used in Unix, Unix-like, and other POSIX-compliant operating systems.

A signal is an notification sent to a process or to a specific thread within the same process to notify it of an event. Common uses of signals are to interrupt, suspend, terminate or kill a process. Signals originated in 1970s Bell Labs Unix and were later specified in the POSIX standard.

When a signal is sent, the operating system interrupts the target process&#x27;s normal flow of execution to deliver the signal. Execution can be interrupted during any non-atomic instruction. If the process has previously registered a signal handler, that routine is executed. Otherwise, the default signal handler is executed.

Embedded programs may find signals useful for inter-process communications, as signals are notable for their algorithmic efficiency.

Signals are similar to interrupts, the difference being that interrupts are mediated by the CPU and handled by the kernel while signals are mediated by the kernel (possibly via system calls) and handled by individual processes. The kernel may pass an interrupt as a signal to the process that caused it (typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE).

==History==
* Version 1 Unix (1971) had separate system calls to catch interrupts, quits, and machine traps.
* appeared in Version 2 (1972).
* Version 4 (1973) combined all traps into one call, .
* Version 5 (1974) could send arbitrary signals. 
* In Version 7 (1979) each numbered trap received a symbolic name.
* Plan 9 from Bell Labs (late 80s) replaced signals with &quot;notes&quot;, which permit sending short, arbitrary strings.

==Sending signals==
The system call sends a specified signal to a specified process, if permissions allow. Similarly, the command allows a user to send signals to processes. The library function sends the specified signal to the current process.

Exceptions such as division by zero, segmentation violation (SIGSEGV), and floating point exception (SIGFPE) will cause a core dump and terminate the program.

The kernel can generate signals to notify processes of events. For example, SIGPIPE will be generated when a process writes to a pipe which has been closed by the reader; by default, this causes the process to terminate, which is convenient when constructing shell pipelines.

Typing certain key combinations at the controlling terminal of a running process causes the system to send it certain signals:

* Ctrl-C (in older Unixes, DEL) sends an INT signal (&quot;interrupt&quot;, SIGINT); by default, this causes the process to terminate.
* Ctrl-Z sends a TSTP signal (&quot;terminal stop&quot;, SIGTSTP); by default, this causes the process to suspend execution.
* Ctrl-\ sends a QUIT signal (SIGQUIT); by default, this causes the process to terminate and dump core.
* Ctrl-T (not supported on all UNIXes) sends an INFO signal (SIGINFO); by default, and if supported by the command, this causes the operating system to show information about the running command.

These default key combinations with modern operating systems can be changed with the command.

==Handling signals==
Signal handlers can be installed with the or system call. If a signal handler is not installed for a particular signal, the default handler is used. Otherwise the signal is intercepted and the signal handler is invoked. The process can also specify two default behaviors, without creating a handler: ignore the signal (SIG_IGN) and use the default signal handler (SIG_DFL). There are two signals which cannot be intercepted and handled: SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.

===Risks===
Signal handling is vulnerable to race conditions. As signals are asynchronous, another signal (even of the same type) can be delivered to the process during execution of the signal handling routine.

The call can be used to block and unblock delivery of signals. Blocked signals are not delivered to the process until unblocked. Signals that cannot be ignored (SIGKILL and SIGSTOP) cannot be blocked.

Signals can cause the interruption of a system call in progress, leaving it to the application to manage a non-transparent restart.

Signal handlers should be written in a way that does not result in any unwanted side-effects, e.g. alteration, signal mask alteration, signal disposition change, and other global process attribute changes. Use of non-reentrant functions, e.g., or , inside signal handlers is also unsafe. In particular, the POSIX specification and the Linux man page require that all system functions directly or &quot;indirectly&quot; called from a signal function are &quot;async-signal safe&quot;. The man page gives a list of such async-signal safe system functions (practically the system calls), otherwise it is an undefined behavior. It is suggested to simply set some variable in a signal handler, and to test it elsewhere.

Signal handlers can instead put the signal into a queue and immediately return. The main thread will then continue &quot;uninterrupted&quot; until signals are taken from the queue, such as in an event loop. &quot;Uninterrupted&quot; here means that operations that block may return prematurely and must be resumed, as mentioned above. Signals should be processed from the queue on the main thread and not by worker pools, as that reintroduces the problem of asynchronicity. However, managing a queue is not possible in an async-signal safe way with only , as only single reads and writes to such variables are guaranteed to be atomic, not increments or (fetch-and)-decrements, as would be required for a queue. Thus, effectively, only one signal per handler can be queued safely with until it has been processed.

==Relationship with hardware exceptions==
A process&#x27;s execution may result in the generation of a hardware exception, for instance, if the process attempts to divide by zero or incurs a page fault.

In Unix-like operating systems, this event automatically changes the processor context to start executing a kernel exception handler. In case of some exceptions, such as a page fault, the kernel has sufficient information to fully handle the event itself and resume the process&#x27;s execution.

Other exceptions, however, the kernel cannot process intelligently and it must instead defer the exception handling operation to the faulting process. This deferral is achieved via the signal mechanism, wherein the kernel sends to the process a signal corresponding to the current exception. For example, if a process attempted integer divide by zero on an x86 CPU, a &quot;divide error&quot; exception would be generated and cause the kernel to send the SIGFPE signal to the process.

Similarly, if the process attempted to access a memory address outside of its virtual address space, the kernel would notify the process of this violation via a SIGSEGV (segmentation violation signal). The exact mapping between signal names and exceptions is obviously dependent upon the CPU, since exception types differ between architectures.

==POSIX signals==
The list below documents the signals specified in the Single Unix Specification. All signals are defined as macro constants in the codice_1 header file. The name of the macro constant consists of a &quot;SIG&quot; prefix followed by a mnemonic name for the signal.

A process can define how to handle incoming POSIX signals. If a process does not define a behaviour for a signal, then the &quot;default handler&quot; for that signal is being used. The table below lists some default actions for POSIX-compliant UNIX systems, such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux.

; &quot;Portable number:&quot;
: For most signals the corresponding signal number is implementation-defined. This column lists the numbers specified in the POSIX standard.

; &quot;Actions explained:&quot;
: Terminate Abnormal termination of the process. The process is terminated with all the consequences of _exit() except that the status made available to wait() and waitpid() indicates abnormal termination by the specified signal.
: Terminate (core dump) Abnormal termination of the process. Additionally, implementation-defined abnormal termination actions, such as creation of a core file, may occur.
: Ignore Ignore the signal.
: Stop Stop (or suspend) the process.
: Continue Continue the process, if it is stopped; otherwise, ignore the signal.

; and 
: The SIGABRT signal is sent to a process to tell it to abort, i.e. to terminate. The signal is usually initiated by the process itself when it calls codice_2 function of the C Standard Library, but it can be sent to the process from outside like any other signal.
: SIGIOT indicates that the CPU has executed an explicit &quot;trap&quot; instruction (without a defined function), or an unimplemented instruction (when emulation is unavailable).
::&quot;Note: &quot;input/output trap&quot; is a misnomer for any CPU &quot;trap&quot; instruction. The term reflects early usage of such instructions, predominantly to implement I/O functions, but they are not inherently tied to device I/O and may be used for other purposes such as communication between virtual &amp; real hosts.&quot;
: SIGIOT and SIGABRT are typically the same signal, and receipt of that signal may indicate any of the conditions above.
; , and 
: The SIGALRM, SIGVTALRM and SIGPROF signals are sent to a process when the corresponding time limit is reached. The process sets these time limits by calling codice_3 or codice_4. The time limit for SIGALRM is based on real or clock time; SIGVTALRM is based on CPU time used by the process; and SIGPROF is based on CPU time used by the process and by the system on its behalf (known as a &quot;profiling timer&quot;). On some systems SIGALRM may be used internally by the implementation of the codice_5 function.
: The SIGBUS signal is sent to a process when it causes a bus error. The conditions that lead to the signal being sent are, for example, incorrect memory access alignment or non-existent physical address.
: The SIGCHLD signal is sent to a process when a child process terminates, is stopped, or resumes after being stopped. One common usage of the signal is to instruct the operating system to clean up the resources used by a child process after its termination without an explicit call to the codice_6 system call.
: The SIGCONT signal instructs the operating system to continue (restart) a process previously paused by the SIGSTOP or SIGTSTP signal. One important use of this signal is in job control in the Unix shell.
: The SIGFPE signal is sent to a process when an exceptional (but not necessarily erroneous) condition has been detected in the floating-point or integer arithmetic hardware. This may include division by zero, floating-point underflow or overflow, integer overflow, an invalid operation or an inexact computation. Behaviour may differ depending on hardware.
: The SIGHUP signal is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed. It was originally designed to notify the process of a serial line drop (a hangup). In modern systems, this signal usually means that the controlling pseudo or virtual terminal has been closed. Many daemons (who have no controlling terminal) interpret receipt of this signal as a request to reload their configuration files and flush/reopen their logfiles instead of exiting. nohup is a command to make a command ignore the signal.
: The SIGILL signal is sent to a process when it attempts to execute an illegal, malformed, unknown, or privileged instruction.
: The SIGINT signal is sent to a process by its controlling terminal when a user wishes to interrupt the process. This is typically initiated by pressing , but on some systems, the &quot;delete&quot; character or &quot;break&quot; key can be used.
: The SIGKILL signal is sent to a process to cause it to terminate immediately (kill). In contrast to SIGTERM and SIGINT, this signal cannot be caught or ignored, and the receiving process cannot perform any clean-up upon receiving this signal. The following exceptions apply:
:* Zombie processes cannot be killed since they are already dead and waiting for their parent processes to reap them.
:* Processes that are in the blocked state will not die until they wake up again.
:* The &quot;init&quot; process is special: It does not get signals that it does not want to handle, and thus it can ignore SIGKILL. An exception from this rule is while init is ptraced on Linux.
:* An uninterruptibly sleeping process may not terminate (and free its resources) even when sent SIGKILL. This is one of the few cases in which a UNIX system may have to be rebooted to solve a temporary software problem.
:SIGKILL is used as a last resort when terminating processes in most system shutdown procedures if it does not voluntarily exit in response to SIGTERM. To speed the computer shutdown procedure, Mac OS X 10.6, aka Snow Leopard, will send SIGKILL to applications that have marked themselves &quot;clean&quot; resulting in faster shutdown times with, presumably, no ill effects. The command has a similar, while dangerous effect, when executed e.g. in Linux; it does not let programs save unsaved data. It has other options, and with none, uses the safer SIGTERM signal.
: The SIGPIPE signal is sent to a process when it attempts to write to a pipe without a process connected to the other end.
: The SIGPOLL signal is sent when an event occurred on an explicitly watched file descriptor. Using it effectively leads to making asynchronous I/O requests since the kernel will poll the descriptor in place of the caller. It provides an alternative to active polling.
; to 
: The SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX signals are intended to be used for user-defined purposes. They are real-time signals.
: The SIGQUIT signal is sent to a process by its controlling terminal when the user requests that the process quit and perform a core dump.
: The SIGSEGV signal is sent to a process when it makes an invalid virtual memory reference, or segmentation fault, i.e. when it performs a segmentation violation.
: The SIGSTOP signal instructs the operating system to stop a process for later resumption.
: The SIGSYS signal is sent to a process when it passes a bad argument to a system call. In practice, this kind of signal is rarely encountered since applications rely on libraries (e.g. libc) to make the call for them. SIGSYS can be received by applications violating the Linux Seccomp security rules configured to restrict them. SIGSYS can also be used to emulate foreign system calls, e.g. emulate Windows system calls on Linux.
: The SIGTERM signal is sent to a process to request its termination. Unlike the SIGKILL signal, it can be caught and interpreted or ignored by the process. This allows the process to perform nice termination releasing resources and saving state if appropriate. SIGINT is nearly identical to SIGTERM.
: The SIGTSTP signal is sent to a process by its controlling terminal to request it to stop (terminal stop). It is commonly initiated by the user pressing . Unlike SIGSTOP, the process can register a signal handler for, or ignore, the signal.
; and 
: The SIGTTIN and SIGTTOU signals are sent to a process when it attempts to read in or write out respectively from the tty while in the background. Typically, these signals are received only by processes under job control; daemons do not have controlling terminals and, therefore, should never receive these signals.
: The SIGTRAP signal is sent to a process when an exception (or trap) occurs: a condition that a debugger has requested to be informed of for example, when a particular function is executed, or when a particular variable changes value.
: The SIGURG signal is sent to a process when a socket has urgent or out-of-band data available to read.
; and 
: The SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals are sent to a process to indicate user-defined conditions.
: The SIGXCPU signal is sent to a process when it has used up the CPU for a duration that exceeds a certain predetermined user-settable value. The arrival of a SIGXCPU signal provides the receiving process a chance to quickly save any intermediate results and to exit gracefully, before it is terminated by the operating system using the SIGKILL signal.
: The SIGXFSZ signal is sent to a process when it grows a file that exceeds the maximum allowed size.
: The SIGWINCH signal is sent to a process when its controlling terminal changes its size (a window change).

==Miscellaneous signals==
The following signals are not specified in the POSIX specification. They are, however, sometimes used on various systems.
: The SIGEMT signal is sent to a process when an emulator trap occurs.
: The SIGINFO signal is sent to a process when a status (info) request is received from the controlling terminal.
: The SIGPWR signal is sent to a process when the system experiences a power failure.
: The SIGLOST signal is sent to a process when a file lock is lost.
: The SIGSTKFLT signal is sent to a process when the coprocessor experiences a stack fault (i.e. popping when the stack is empty or pushing when it is full). It is defined by, but not used on Linux, where a x87 coprocessor stack fault will generate SIGFPE instead.
: The SIGUNUSED signal is sent to a process when a system call with an unused system call number is made. It is synonymous with SIGSYS on most architectures.
: The SIGCLD signal is synonymous with SIGCHLD.

<doc id="938607" wikidata="Q239355" url="?curid=938607" title="Solomon ibn Gabirol">
<text>Solomon ibn Gabirol or Solomon ben Judah (, ; , ) was an 11th-century Jewish poet and philosopher in the Neo-Platonic tradition in Al-Andalus. He published over a hundred poems, as well as works of biblical exegesis, philosophy, ethics and satire. One source credits ibn Gabirol with creating a golem, possibly female, for household chores.

In the 19th century it was discovered that medieval translators had Latinized Gabirol&#x27;s name to Avicebron or Avencebrol and had translated his work on Jewish Neo-Platonic philosophy into a Latin form that had in the intervening centuries been highly regarded as a work of Islamic or Christian scholarship. As such, ibn Gabirol is well known in the history of philosophy for the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form (&quot;Universal Hylomorphism&quot;), and for his emphasis on divine will.

==Biography==
Little is known of Gabirol&#x27;s life, and some sources give contradictory information. Sources agree that he was born in Málaga, but are unclear whether in late 1021 or early 1022 CE. The year of his death is a matter of dispute, with conflicting accounts having him dying either before age 30 or by age 48.

Gabirol lived a life of material comfort, never having to work to sustain himself, but he lived a difficult and loveless life, suffering ill health, misfortunes, fickle friendships, and powerful enemies. From his teenage years, he suffered from some disease, possibly lupus vulgaris, that would leave him embittered and in constant pain. He indicates in his poems that he considered himself short and ugly. Of his personality, Moses ibn Ezra wrote: &quot;his irascible temperament dominated his intellect, nor could he rein the demon that was within himself. It came easily to him to lampoon the great, with salvo upon salvo of mockery and sarcasm.&quot; He has been described summarily as &quot;a social misfit.&quot;

Gabirol&#x27;s writings indicate that his father was a prominent figure in Córdoba, but was forced to relocate to Málaga during a political crisis in 1013. Gabirol&#x27;s parents died while he was a child, leaving him an orphan with no siblings or close relatives. He was befriended, supported and protected by a prominent political figure of the time, Yekutiel ibn Hassan al-Mutawakkil ibn Qabrun, and moved to Zaragoza, then an important center of Jewish culture. Gabirol&#x27;s anti-social temperament, occasionally boastful poetry, and sharp wit earned him powerful enemies, but as long as Jekuthiel lived, Gabirol remained safe from them and was able to freely immerse himself in study of the Talmud, grammar, geometry, astronomy, and philosophy. However, when Gabirol was seventeen years old, his benefactor was assassinated as the result of a political conspiracy, and by 1045 Gabirol found himself compelled to leave Zaragoza. He was then sponsored by no less than the grand vizier and top general to the kings of Granada, Samuel ibn Naghrillah (Shmuel HaNaggid). Gabirol made ibn Naghrillah an object of praise in his poetry until an estrangement arose between them and ibn Naghrillah became the butt of Gabirol&#x27;s bitterest irony. It seems Gabirol never married, and that he spent the remainder of his life wandering.

Gabirol had become an accomplished poet and philosopher at an early age:
* By age 17, he had composed five of his known poems, one an azhara (&quot;I am the master, and Song is my slave&quot;) enumerating all 613 commandments of Judaism.
* At age 17, he composed a 200-verse elegy for his friend Yekutiel and four other notable elegies to mourn the death of Hai Gaon.
* By age 19, he had composed a 400-verse alphabetical and acrostic poem teaching the rules of Hebrew grammar.
* By age 23 or 25, he had composed, in Arabic, &quot;Improvement of the Moral Qualities&quot; (, translated into Hebrew by Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon as 
* At around age 25, or not, he may have composed his collection of proverbs &quot;Mivchar Pninim&quot; (lit. &quot;Choice of Pearls&quot;), although scholars are divided on his authorship.
* At around age 28, or not, he composed his philosophical work &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;.

As mentioned above, the conflicting accounts of Gabirol&#x27;s death have him dying either before age 30 or by age 48. The opinion of earliest death, that he died before age 30, is believed to be based upon a misreading of medieval sources. The remaining two opinions are that he died either in 1069 or 1070, or around 1058 in Valencia. As to the circumstances of his death, one legend claims that he was trampled to death by an Arab horseman. A second legend relates that he was murdered by a Muslim poet who was jealous of Gabirol&#x27;s poetic gifts, and who secretly buried him beneath the roots of a fig tree. The tree bore fruit in abundant quantity and of extraordinary sweetness. Its uniqueness excited attention and provoked an investigation. The resulting inspection of the tree uncovered Gabirol&#x27;s remains, and led to the identification and execution of the murderer.

==Historical identity==
Though Gabirol&#x27;s legacy was esteemed throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, it was historically minimized by two errors of scholarship that mis-attributed his works.

===False ascription as King Solomon===
Gabirol seems to have often been called &quot;the Málagan&quot;, after his place of birth, and would occasionally so refer to himself when encrypting his signature in his poems (e.g. in &quot;שטר עלי בעדים&quot;, he embeds his signature as an acrostic in the form &quot;אני שלמה הקטן ברבי יהודה גבירול מאלקי חזק&quot; – meaning: &quot;I am young Solomon, son of Rabi Yehuda, from Malaqa, Hazak&quot;). While in Modern Hebrew the city is also called Málaga (), that is in deference to its current Spanish pronunciation. In Gabirol&#x27;s day, when it was ruled by Arabic speakers, it was called &quot;Mālaqa&quot; (), as it is to this day by Arabic speakers. The 12th-century Arab philosopher Jabir ibn Aflah misinterpreted manuscript signatures of the form &quot;שלמה ... יהודה ... אלמלאק&quot; to mean &quot;Solomon ... the Jew .. the king&quot;, and so ascribed to Solomon some seventeen philosophical essays of Gabirol. The 15th-century Jewish philosopher Yohanan Alemanno imported that error back into the Hebrew canon, and added another four works to the list of false ascriptions.

===Identification as Avicebron===
In 1846, Solomon Munk discovered among the Hebrew manuscripts in the French National Library in Paris a work by Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera. Comparing it with a Latin work by Avicebron entitled &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;, Munk proved them to both excerpt an Arabic original of which the &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; was evidently the translation. Munk concluded that Avicebron or Avencebrol, who had for centuries been believed to be a Christian or Arabic Muslim philosopher, was instead identical with the Jewish Solomon ibn Gabirol. The centuries-long confusion was in part due to a content feature atypical in Jewish writings: &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; exhibits an independence of Jewish religious dogma and does not cite Biblical verses or Rabbinic sources.

The progression in the Latinization of Gabirol&#x27;s name seems to have been ibn Gabirol, Ibngebirol, Avengebirol. Avengebrol, Avencebrol, Avicebrol, and finally Avicebron. Some sources still refer to him as Avicembron, Avicenbrol, or Avencebrol.

==Philosophy==

Gabirol, in his poem &quot;כשרש עץ&quot; (line 24), claims to have written twenty philosophical works. Through scholarly deduction (see above), we know their titles, but we have the texts of only two.

Gabirol made his mark on the history of philosophy under his alias as Avicebron, one of the first teachers of Neo-Platonism in Europe, and author of &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; . As such, he is best known for the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form (“Universal Hylomorphism”), and for his emphasis on divine will.

His role has been compared to that of Philo: both were ignored by their fellow Jews, but exercised considerable influence upon Gentiles (Philo upon primitive Christianity, Gabirol upon medieval Christian scholasticism); and both served as cultural intermediaries (Philo between Hellenistic philosophy and the Oriental world; Gabirol between Greco-Arabic philosophy and the Occident).

===&quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;===
&quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;, originally written in Arabic under the title &quot;Yanbu&#x27; al-Hayat&quot; () and later translated into Hebrew by Ibn Tibbon as , , lit. &quot;Source of Life&quot;, (cf. ) is a Neo-Platonic philosophical dialogue between master and disciple on the nature of Creation and how understanding what we are (our nature) can help us know how to live (our purpose). &quot;His goal is to understand the nature of being and human being so that he might better understand and better inspire the pursuit of knowledge and the doing of good deeds.&quot; The work stands out in the history of philosophy for introducing the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form, and for its emphasis on divine will.

::Student: What is the purpose of man?
::Teacher: The inclination of his soul to the higher world in order that everyone might return to his like.
::(&quot;Fons&quot; &quot;Vitæ&quot; 1.2, p. 4, lines 23–25)

In the closing sentences of the Fons &quot;Vitæ&quot; (5.43, p. 338, line 21), ibn Gabirol further describes this state of “return” as a liberation from death and a cleaving to the source of life.

The work was originally composed in Arabic, of which no copies are extant. It was preserved for the ages by a translation into Latin in the year 1150 by Abraham ibn Daud and Dominicus Gundissalinus, who was the first official director of the Toledo School of Translators, a scholastic philosopher, and the archdeacon of Segovia, Spain. In the 13th century, Shem Tov ibn Falaquera wrote a summary of &quot;Fons&quot; &quot;Vitæ&quot; in Hebrew, and only in 1926 was the full Latin text translated into Hebrew.

&quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; consists of five sections:
# matter and form in general and their relation in physical substances ();
# the substance which underlies the corporeality of the world ();
# proofs of the existence of intermediaries between God and the physical world (, lit. &quot;intelligibiles&quot;);
# proofs that these &quot;intelligibiles&quot; are likewise constituted of matter and form;
# universal matter and universal form.

&quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; posits that the basis of existence and the source of life in every created thing is a combination of &quot;matter&quot; () and &quot;form&quot;. The doctrine of matter and form informed the work&#x27;s subtitle: &quot;&quot;De Materia et Forma.&quot; Its chief doctrines are:
# everything that exists may be reduced to three categories:
## God;
## matter and form (i.e. Creation);
## will (an intermediary).
# All created beings are constituted of form and matter.
# This holds true for both the physical world () and the spiritual world (), which latter are the connecting link between the first substance (i.e. the Godhead, ) and the physical world (, lit. &quot;substance divided into nine categories&quot;).
# Matter and form are always and everywhere in the relation of &quot;&quot;sustinens&quot; and &quot;sustentatum&quot;, &quot;propriatum&quot; and &quot;proprietas&quot;&quot;: substratum and property or attribute.

===Influence within Judaism===

Though Gabirol as a philosopher was ignored by the Jewish community, Gabirol as a poet was not, and through his poetry, he introduced his philosophical ideas. His best-known poem, &quot;Keter Malkut&quot; (&quot;Royal Crown&quot;), is a philosophical treatise in poetical form, the &quot;double&quot; of the &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;. For example, the eighty-third line of the poem points to one of the teachings of the &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;; namely, that all the attributes predicated of God exist apart in thought alone and not in reality.

Moses ibn Ezra is the first to mention Gabirol as a philosopher, praising his intellectual achievements, and quoting several passages from the &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; in his own work, &quot;Aruggat ha-Bosem&quot;. Abraham ibn Ezra, who cites Gabirol&#x27;s philosophico-allegorical Bible interpretation, borrows from the &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; both in his prose and in his poetry without giving due credit.

The 12th-century philosopher Joseph ibn Tzaddik borrows extensively from the &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; in his work &quot;Microcosmos&quot;.

Another 12th-century philosopher, Abraham ibn Daud of Toledo, was the first to take exception to Gabirol&#x27;s teachings. In &quot;Sefer ha-Kabbalah&quot; he praises Gabirol as a poet. But to counteract the influence of ibn Gabirol the philosopher, he wrote an Arabic book, translated into Hebrew under the title &quot;Emunah Ramah&quot;, in which he reproaches Gabirol for having philosophized without any regard to the requirements of the Jewish religious position and bitterly accuses him of mistaking a number of poor reasons for one good one. He criticizes Gabirol for being repetitive, wrong-headed and unconvincing.

Occasional traces of ibn Gabriol&#x27;s thought are found in some of the Kabbalistic literature of the 13th century. Later references to ibn Gabirol, such as those of Elijah Chabillo, Isaac Abarbanel, Judah Abarbanel, Moses Almosnino, and Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, are based on an acquaintance with the scholastic philosophy, especially the works of Aquinas.

The 13th-century Jewish philosopher Berechiah ha-Nakdan drew upon Gabirol&#x27;s works in his encyclopedic philosophical text &quot;Sefer Haḥibbur&quot; (, , lit. &quot;The Book of Compilation&quot;).

===Influence on Scholasticism===

For over six centuries, the Christian world regarded &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; as the work of a Christian philosopher or Arabic Muslim philosopher, and it became a cornerstone and bone of contention in many theologically charged debates between Franciscans and Dominicans. The Aristotelian Dominicans led by St. Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas opposed the teachings of &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot;; the Platonist Franciscans led by Duns Scotus supported its teachings, and led to its acceptance in Christian philosophy, influencing later philosophers such as the 16th-century Dominican friar Giordano Bruno. Other early supporters of Gabirol&#x27;s philosophy include the following:

* Dominicus Gundissalinus, who translated the &quot;Fons Vitæ&quot; into Latin and incorporated its ideas into his own teaching.
* William of Auvergne, who refers to the work of Gabirol under the title &quot;Fons Sapientiæ&quot;. He speaks of Gabirol as a Christian and praises him as &quot;&quot;unicus omnium philosophantium nobilissimus&quot;.&quot;
* Alexander of Hales and his disciple Bonaventura, who accept the teaching of Gabirol that spiritual substances consist of matter and form.
* William of Lamarre

The main points at issue between Gabirol and Aquinas were as follows:
# the universality of matter, Aquinas holding that spiritual substances are immaterial;
# the plurality of forms in a physical entity, which Aquinas denied;
# the power of activity of physical beings, which Gabirol affirmed. Aquinas held that Gabirol made the mistake of transferring to real existence the theoretical combination of genus and species, and that he thus came to the erroneous conclusion that in reality all things are constituted of matter and form as genus and species respectively.

=== Ex nihilo ===
Gabirol denied the idea of &quot;creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;&quot; because he felt that that idea would make God &quot;subject to the [laws of existence]&quot;.

==Ethics==

===&quot;The Improvement of the Moral Qualities&quot;===
&quot;The Improvement of the Moral Qualities&quot;, originally written in Arabic under the title Islah al-Khlaq (), and later translated by Ibn Tibbon as (, ) is an ethical treatise that has been called by Munk &quot;a popular manual of morals.&quot; It was composed by Gabirol at Zaragoza in 1045, at the request of some friends who wished to possess a book treating of the qualities of man and the methods of effecting their improvement.

The innovations in the work are that it presents the principles of ethics independently of religious dogma and that it proposes that the five physical senses are emblems and instruments of virtue and vice, but not their agents; thus, a person&#x27;s inclination to vice is subject to a person&#x27;s will to change. Gabirol presents a tabular diagram of the relationship of twenty qualities to the five senses, reconstructed at right, and urges his readers to train the qualities of their souls unto good through self-understanding and habituation. He regards man&#x27;s ability to do so as an example of divine benevolence.

While this work of Gabirol is not widely studied in Judaism, it has many points in common with Bahya ibn Paquda&#x27;s very popular work &quot;Chovot HaLevavot&quot;, written in 1040, also in Zaragoza.

===&quot;Mivchar HaPeninim&quot;===
&quot;Mukhtar al-Jawahir&quot; (), &quot;Mivchar HaPeninim&quot; (. lit. &quot;The Choice of Pearls&quot;), an ethics work of sixty-four chapters, has been attributed to Gabirol since the 19th century, but this is doubtful. It was originally published, along with a short commentary, in Soncino, Italy, in 1484, and has since been re-worked and re-published in many forms and abridged editions (e.g. Joseph Ḳimcḥi versified the work under the title &quot;Shekel ha-Kodesh&quot;).

The work is a collection of maxims, proverbs, and moral reflections, many of them of Arabic origin, and bears a strong similarity to the Florilegium of Hunayn ibn Ishaq and other Arabic and Hebrew collections of ethics sayings, which were highly prized by both Arabs and Jews.

==Poetry==
Gabirol wrote both sacred and secular poems, in Hebrew, and was recognized even by his critics (e.g. Moses ibn Ezra and Yehuda Alharizi) as the greatest poet of his age. His secular poems express disillusionment with social mores and worldliness, but are written with a sophistication and artistry that reveals him to have been socially influenced by his worldly Arabic contemporaries.

Gabirol&#x27;s lasting poetic legacy, however, was his sacred works. Today, &quot;his religious lyrics are considered by many to be the most powerful of their kind in the medieval Hebrew tradition, and his long cosmological masterpiece, &quot;Keter Malchut&quot;, is acknowledged today as one of the greatest poems in all of Hebrew literature.&quot; His verses are distinctive for tackling complex metaphysical concepts, expressing scathing satire, and declaring his religious devotion unabashedly.

Gabirol wrote with a pure Biblical Hebrew diction that would become the signature style of the Spanish school of Hebrew poets, and he popularized in Hebrew poetry the strict Arabic meter introduced by Dunash ben Labrat. Abraham ibn Ezra calls Gabirol, not ben Labrat, &quot;the writer of metric songs,&quot; and in &quot;Sefer Zaḥot&quot; uses Gabirol&#x27;s poems to illustrate various poetic meters.

He wrote also more than one hundred piyyuṭim and selichot for the Sabbath, festivals, and fast-days, most of which have been included in the Holy Day prayer books of Sephardim, Ashkenazim, and even Karaites Some of his most famous in liturgical use include the following:
* &quot;Azharot&quot;
* &quot;Keter Malchuth&quot; (lit. Royal Crown), for recitation on Yom Kippur
* various dirges (&quot;kinnot&quot;) mourning the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the plight of Israel

Gabirol&#x27;s most famous poem is &quot;Keter Malchut&quot; (lit. Royal Crown), which, in 900 lines, describes the cosmos as testifying to its own creation by God, based upon the then current (11th-century) scientific understanding of the cosmos.

Some popular examples that are often sung outside of the liturgy include: Shalom L&#x27;ben Dodi, Shachar Abakeshcha.

Gabirol&#x27;s poetry has been set to music by the modern composer Aaron Jay Kernis, in an album titled &quot;Symphony of Meditations.&quot;

In 2007 Gabirol&#x27;s poetry has been set to music by the Israeli rock guitarist Berry Sakharof and the Israeli modern composer Rea Mochiach, in a piece titled &quot;Red Lips&quot; (&quot;Adumey Ha-Sefatot&quot; &quot;אֲדֻמֵּי הַשְּׂפָתוֹת&quot;)

<text>The Holiday Plan are an English rock band from Hackney and Islington, London that split up in May 2005, but reformed in June 2006 (performing under a host of different names). Consisting of a bassist/vocalist Matt Rider, as well as two guitarists (Gary Jenkins and Blue Quinn) and drummer (Daniel Bodie), The Holiday Plan play melodic punk rock with dual-guitar parts, and could be classed as gruff punk. The band were featured on MTV&#x27;s documentary on upcoming bands, Breaking Point, where MTV followed The Holiday Plan, as well as other bands, around as they went around touring, among other rock band duties.

The band toured with Billy Talent, Thrice, Reuben, My Awesome Compilation, Jackson, Matchbook Romance and played numerous shows with Biffy Clyro.

Matt Rider and Daniel Bodie now play in Matt Trakker along with bass player Eoin Keeley of the ska/dub/punk band Bogus Gasman. Matt Trakker won the 2008 Road to V competition and got to perform live at the V Festival in 2008, as well as returning to play V festival in 2009. Matt Trakker are due to release their debut single in early 2010.

Daniel Bodie moved to New Zealand in October 2010, with Max Taylor taking over on drums. Mat Elias (Name your Heroes/Brinkworth/Piper saint) joined as drummer in April 2012.

<doc id="938613" wikidata="Q966261" url="?curid=938613" title="Joe Barton">
<text>Joseph Linus Barton (born September 15, 1949) is an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he represented in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1985 to 2019. The district included Arlington, part of Fort Worth, and several small towns and rural areas south of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex. He was also a member of the Tea Party Caucus. In 2014, Barton became the longest-serving member of the Texas congressional delegation.

Barton described himself as &quot;a constant defender of conservative ideals and values&quot;. He advocated for deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries, and served as vice-chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committees. He denied that manmade carbon emissions had contributed to global warming, was a proponent of the use of fossil fuels, voted in favor of the May 2017 GOP plan to replace Obamacare, supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s ban on immigration from certain predominantly Muslim nations, and supported the death penalty for people caught spying. Barton led a successful effort to repeal the oil export ban in the House in 2015. His environmental record of defending industries against tighter pollution controls earned him the nickname &quot;Smokey Joe.&quot;

Barton came to national prominence after telling a citizen at a town hall meeting to &quot;shut up.&quot; He came to national attention again when sexually explicit photos that he had shared with women surfaced online in 2017. In November 2017, Barton announced that he would not seek re-election in 2018 following a sex scandal.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Barton was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Bess Wynell (née Buice) and Larry Linus Barton. He graduated from Waco High School. He attended Texas A&amp;M University in College Station on a Gifford-Hill Opportunity Award scholarship, and received a B.S. in industrial engineering in 1972. An M.Sc. in industrial administration from Purdue University followed in 1973.

Following college, Barton entered private industry until 1981, when he became a White House Fellow and served under United States Secretary of Energy James B. Edwards. Later, he began consulting for Atlantic Richfield Oil and Gas Co., before being elected to the United States Congress in 1984.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
====1984–86====

Barton made his first run for elected office in 1984, when he entered the Republican primary for Texas&#x27;s 6th congressional district after three-term incumbent Phil Gramm left his seat to run for the United States Senate that year. He finished first in the five-candidate field with 42%, and very narrowly defeated Max Hoyt in the runoff with 50%. He then defeated Democratic nominee and former State Representative Dan Kubiak 57%–43%. Barton was one of six freshmen Republican U.S. congressmen elected from Texas in 1984, known as the Texas Six Pack.

In 1986, Barton won re-election against Democratic candidate Pete Geren, who was later elected to Congress from a neighboring district. Barton defeated Geren 56%–44%.

====1988–2010====
During this period, Barton won each re-election with 60% of the vote or more. His worst general election performance was in 2006, when he defeated Democratic candidate David Harris 60%–37%, a 23-point margin. The 2008 election was his second-worst performance, defeating Democratic candidate Ludwig Otto by a 26-point margin, 62%–36%.

He was only challenged in the primary twice in this time period: in 1992 and 1994. In 1992, he defeated Mike McGinn 79 to 21%. In 1994, he defeated Jerry Goode 89%–11%.

====2012====
Because of increasing controversy surrounding his record in office, election battles became increasingly contentious. In 2011, a Super PAC was formed by Texas conservative groups to remove him and several other long-time incumbents from office.
The Democratic National Committee used Barton&#x27;s comments in political ads, shown nationally against all Republican candidates. Several websites were created and dedicated to simply removing Barton from office. DefeatJoeBarton.com/ was created by Democratic challengers. All content was later removed, though the site is still owned.

Barton drew three primary challengers: Joe Chow, Mayor of Addison; Itamar Gelbman, a security consultant; and Frank C. Kuchar, a Dallas businessman and former preacher. Chow is Texas&#x27; first Asian-American mayor. He called Barton &quot;the most corrupt congressman in the State of Texas.&quot; At the end of March 2012, Barton had $1.3 million in cash on hand, compared with $28,800 for Chow, $178,000 for Gelbman, and $463 for Kuchar.

====2014====

In the Republican primary on March 4, Barton won re-nomination to a 16th term in the U.S. House. He polled 32,579 (72.7%); his 2012 primary opponent, Frank Kuchar, trailed with 12,260 votes (27.3%). On November 4, Barton handily won re-election over Democratic opponent David Cozad.

====2016====

Barton polled 55,197 votes (68.7%) in a three-candidate field for the Republican House nomination in the March 1 primary election. The runner-up, Steven Fowler, received 17,927 votes (22.3%). To win his 17th consecutive term in the House, Barton then defeated in the November 8 general election the Democrat Ruby Faye Woolridge (born 1948) of Arlington, who had polled 22,954 votes (69.7%) in her earlier three-candidate Democratic primary. Barton finished with 159,444 votes (58.3%) to Woolridge&#x27;s 106,667 (39%); the most any Democrat had received against Barton in his three-decade career. The remaining 7,185 votes (2.6%) went to the Green Party candidate, Darrel Smith, Jr.

====2018====
Texas&#x27;s filing deadline for the House seat held by Barton was December 11, 2017. The primary was held March 6, 2018. Barton initially said that he would run for reelection, but announced on November 30, 2017, that he would not seek reelection in 2018.

If Barton resigned from his seat (as predicted by Austin Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak), there would be a special, open primary election in 2018, in which candidates from all parties would appear on a single ballot; if no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, then the top two vote-getters (regardless of party) will advance to a runoff.

Democrat former educator Ruby Faye Woolridge had indicated she would run for the seat, as did Democrats Jana Lynne Sanchez (endorsed by the New Democrat Coalition and the environmental group Climate Hawks Vote), party activist Justin Snider, Levii R. Shocklee of Arlington, and lawyer John Duncan. Republicans Jake Ellzey (a retired U.S. Navy fighter pilot and commissioner on the Texas Veterans Commission) and Dr. Monte Mark Mitchell (a Fort Worth physician, attorney, and custom home builder) filed to oppose Barton, and other Republican candidates for Barton&#x27;s seat may include State Representative Tony Tinderholt, State Senators Brian Birdwell and Konni Burton, Ellis County Commissioner Paul Perry, and former Tarrant County Tax Assessor-Collector Ron Wright (Barton&#x27;s former chief of staff and district director).

The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; urged that Barton not seek re-election. Tim O&#x27;Hare, the Chairman of the Tarrant County Republican Party, called on Barton &quot;to not seek re-election and to retire from Congress by the end of [2017],&quot; saying he is guilty of &quot;sexual immorality.&quot; Republican State Senators Konni Burton and Brian Birdwell also urged Barton to not seek re-election. Brian Mayes, a Dallas political consultant, said Barton was vulnerable in his upcoming election battle &quot;if he gets a motivated opponent&quot;, and that he risked getting lumped in &quot;fairly or unfairly&quot; with sexual misconduct allegations in Congress. Barton announced on November 30, 2017, that he would not seek reelection.

===Tenure===

Barton voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in both of its manifestations.

In March 2011, Barton sponsored the Better Use of Light Bulbs Act, which would repeal the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, signed by President George W. Bush. The 2007 law set energy efficiency standards for light bulbs, effectively eliminating most or all incandescent light bulbs. Barton said &quot;People don&#x27;t want Congress dictating what light fixtures they can use.&quot;

Barton was a member of the Freedom Caucus and the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus. In the first session of the 115th United States Congress, Barton was ranked the 42nd most bipartisan member of the House by the Bipartisan Index, a metric published by The Lugar Center and Georgetown&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy to assess congressional bipartisanship.

;Congressional action
* Former Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, House sponsor of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and chairman of the House–Senate energy conference committee. On his website he speaks of his diligent work to promote a conservative agenda, and how &quot;in his first legislative victory as Chairman, the House overwhelmingly passed legislation to limit indecency on the public airwaves.&quot;
* Both initiated and eliminated &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision for MTBE (in Energy Policy Act of 2005).
* Co-founded the Congressional Privacy Caucus, cosponsor of the anti-spyware SPY ACT, initiated .
* Opposed the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 2006
* Barton was a leading voice in Congress for forcing the switch from analog to digital TV. 
* Barton has supported the auctioning off the public airwaves to private companies.

==== Global warming ====

Prompted by a February 2005 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, Barton launched an investigation that year into two climate change studies from 1998 and 1999. In his letters to the authors of the studies he requested details on the studies and the sources of the authors grant funding. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; condemned Barton&#x27;s investigation as a &quot;witch-hunt&quot;. During former Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s testimony to the Energy and Commerce Committee in March 2007, Barton asserted to Gore that &quot;You&#x27;re not just off a little, you&#x27;re totally wrong&quot; (climate scientists have refuted Barton&#x27;s assertion), stating that &quot;Global warming science is uneven and evolving.&quot;

Upset with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s passage of global warming legislation in 2009, he said: &quot;You can&#x27;t regulate God.&quot; At the same time, Barton implied in 2009 that wind is a &quot;finite resource,&quot; and there was a claim made that Barton was suggesting that greater use of wind turbines would &quot;slow the winds down,&quot; which would &quot;cause the temperature to go up,&quot; although a report in &quot;Snopes&quot; suggested that Barton was merely quoting an academic study which suggested that increased use of wind turbines might have unintended consequences for the environment, and that the claim about the linkage between increased use of wind turbines and slowing down the winds was incorrect. In 2013, when discussing the Keystone XL pipeline, he referred to the Genesis flood narrative in the Bible to argue that current climate change isn&#x27;t man-made. Barton rejects the scientific consensus on climate change that climate change is real and that human activity is the primary cause.
Barton has &quot;mocked human-caused climate change&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and is &quot;a long-time denier of global warming&quot; according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and &quot;a longtime skeptic of human involvement in climate change&quot; according to &quot;HuffPost&quot;. In any event, he suggested that humans will &quot;adapt&quot; to climate change because we can &quot;get shade.&quot; &quot;Barton has made a reputation for his outspoken rejection of man-made climate change, and for his support for the oil industry,&quot; according to Suzanne Goldenberg in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

====Autism bills controversy====
Barton tried to block the bipartisan Combating Autism Act of 2006. He said that the money steered toward environmental causes of autism was not the reason he blocked passage of the bill.

The controversy stemmed from the conflict between two bills in the House and Senate. Barton introduced the National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006, while Senator Rick Santorum introduced the Autism bill. Santorum said in a CNN interview that the Senate bill was intended to be &quot;fit into&quot; Barton&#x27;s bill in the House bill. He stated that &quot;I was in constant conversation with him [Barton] and many House members all last week in an attempt to help the NIH bill come through the Senate, as well as try to move the Combating Autism bill through the Senate.&quot; Santorum stated that the Senate bill would investigate possible environmental causes, while the House bill would prevent that.

Barton let the bill die in committee, which upset many people who were vocal about saying Barton had sacrificed the interests of autistic children in the interests of the oil and gas companies that donate heavily to his campaign.

====BP oil spill controversy====
In June 2010, Barton accused the Obama administration of a &quot;$20 billion shakedown&quot; of oil giant BP after the company reached an agreement with the administration to establish an escrow account to pay the claims of people harmed by the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He made the accusation at the outset of a House hearing where BP&#x27;s chief executive officer, Tony Hayward, appeared for the first time before Congress. Facing Hayward at the witness table, Barton said, &quot;I apologize. I do not want to live in a country where any time a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong, is subject to some sort of political pressure that is, again, in my words — amounts to a shakedown, so I apologize.&quot; Prior to the establishment of the agreement, the Obama administration had been public in their criticism of BP for the oil spill.

Barton&#x27;s remarks were criticized by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs and Vice President Joe Biden, GOP congressional leadership as well as by Barton&#x27;s fellow Republicans, some of whom called on him to relinquish his leadership role in the House Energy Subcommittee.

Barton later said that his earlier remarks had been &quot;misconstrued&quot; and that he believed BP was responsible for the accident. Later that day, he issued a statement apologizing for using the term &quot;shakedown&quot; and fully retracted his apology to BP.

====Sodomy and abortion====
In 2010, Barton backed a policy platform that called for re-criminalizing sodomy in Texas. He has 100% ratings from socially conservative groups such as the Family Research Council and the Christian Coalition of America for his opposition to abortion and LGBTQ rights.

====CREW report====
The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) put Barton on its &quot;CREW&#x27;s Most Corrupt Report 2011&quot;. The article stated that on Barton&#x27;s 2008 financial disclosure statement, he inaccurately reported on the source of a natural gas interest that he bought into. The share was purchased through a longtime donor and supporter, who later died. This was discovered by the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; in 2010. According to the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; article, Barton made over $100,000 on the investment. The article and CREW Report both pointed out how Barton buying this undervalued asset from an &quot;advisor&quot; on energy issues could be a conflict of interest to the Congressman&#x27;s position as the Chair of the House&#x27;s Energy Subcommittee. It quoted James Thurber, a Distinguished Professor of Government at American University, as saying: &quot;If you are elected as a public servant to try to do what is right for the public generally and then you use that position to help bring in material wealth, I think it&#x27;s unethical.&quot;

CREW also reported that Barton paid his wife Terri $57,759 in salary and bonuses, from his campaign funds in the 2006 election cycle. A spokesman said that Terri served as the campaign&#x27;s outreach director and planned fund raising and special events. in addition, Barton&#x27;s daughter Kristin was paid $12,622 in salary and bonuses, and his mother, Nell Barton, was paid $7,000 for a car.

====Crude oil ban====
Barton expressed in September 2014 his full support of the U.S. lifting the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports – an issue that sparked controversy among members of the Republican Party. Several research reports had found that exporting the glut of shale oil would ultimately lower U.S. and global fuel prices, rather than raise them; U.S. public opinion was divided on the issue.

====Online poker====
Barton has sought to permit online poker, and regulate it on a federal level. To that end, he has introduced the Online Poker Act of 2011, the Internet Poker Freedom Act of 2013, and the Internet Poker Freedom Act of 2015.

====Health care====
Barton favored repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare). Explaining why the American Health Care Act (the House Republicans&#x27; bill to repeal and replace for the Affordable Care Act) failed in March 2017, Barton said, &quot;Sometimes you&#x27;re playing fantasy football and sometimes you&#x27;re in the real game. We knew the president, if we could get a repeal bill to his desk, would almost certainly veto it. This time we knew if it got to the president&#x27;s desk it would be signed.&quot;

====Hurricane Harvey relief====
Barton voted against Hurricane Harvey relief in 2017. Barton said that he could not support an increase in the debt ceiling.

====Immigration====
Barton supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 Executive Order 13769 banning entry to the United States by nationals of seven Muslim-majority nations.

In November 2017, Barton called on the House leadership to pass naturalization legislation for children who came across the border illegally with their parents.

===Committee assignments===

** Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade

==1993 U.S. Senate election==

In 1993, Barton ran in the special election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Lloyd Bentsen, who became United States Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration. Barton finished third in the contest, behind state treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Bob Krueger, thus missing a runoff slot. He divided the more conservative vote in that election with House colleague Jack Fields of Houston.

==Barton Family Foundation==
The Barton Family Foundation was established in 2005 to support charities within the congressman&#x27;s district. His daughter-in-law, Amy Barton, is the Foundation&#x27;s Executive Director. Major energy corporations, such as the Chicago-based nuclear energy producer, Exelon Corporation, make major gifts to the Foundation. In June 2008, at a time when Barton had introduced legislation to assist corporations with the recycling of spent nuclear fuel, the corporation donated $25,000 to the Foundation. Exelon has also donated $80,000 to Barton&#x27;s campaign funds. The Foundation gave $90,000 to the local Boys and Girls Club, this is the only recorded donation made by the Foundation in its seven-year history.

==Sex scandal==

In November 2017, nude selfie pictures of Barton surfaced online, which he acknowledged were authentic, and which he apologized for to his constituents. He confirmed he himself took the photo, apparently from a video of him masturbating, and sent it to women with whom he was having consensual sexual relationships. An anonymous Twitter user posted the photo of Barton, who had pointed his camera upward from below his genitals, next to a text message reading, &quot;I want you soo bad. Right now. Deep and hard.&quot;

An anonymous woman said that she had received the selfie and other explicit images from Barton, but she did not post any of them on the internet. She also shared with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; a 2015 recorded phone call in which Barton warned her against using the explicit materials &quot;in a way that would negatively affect my career,&quot; threatening to report her to the Capitol Police if she did so. On the taped phone call, Barton said &quot;... I ... met you twice while married and had sex with you on two different occasions&quot;; the woman said that they had slept together in 2012 in Washington, DC, and in 2014 in Texas, and that the Congressman had reimbursed her for her airfare in cash on both occasions. The woman also shared with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; text and social media messages Barton exchanged with her, as well as a 53-second cellphone video in which Barton recorded himself masturbating. She described to the newspaper encounters and contact with Barton spanning a five-year period, beginning in 2011. She said she came forward because: &quot;It&#x27;s not normal for a member of Congress who runs on a GOP platform of family values and conservatism to be scouring the Internet looking for a new sexual liaison.&quot;

A week later a second woman, Kelly Canon, a board member of the Arlington Republican Club and a member of the Republican Women of Arlington who is a constituent of Barton&#x27;s, shared a series of messages—some with sexual overtones—that Barton had sent to her. Barton sent the messages in 2012 and 2013, while Barton was married to his second wife. The messages included questions from Barton about whether Canon was &quot;wearing a tank top only .. and no panties,&quot; followed by &quot;answer me miss evasive.&quot; Barton also messaged her that &quot;men are men...and u r definitely a sexy woman.&quot; When Canon responded that &quot;all the good ones are married,&quot; Barton replied: &quot;I dont know about good..but I am married ... but ...I am not thinking good thoughts at this moment ... blush.&quot; Barton confirmed that he had the message exchange.

A third woman, Cheryl Small, said on November 30, 2017, that Barton had sex with her multiple times in his Ennis office while he was married.

His second ex-wife said: &quot;Of course I wasn&#x27;t surprised. I guess I was more surprised that some of these ladies finally came forward.&quot; She said she found it ironic that Barton was one of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s loudest critics during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Similarly, columnist Jim Schutze of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; noted that Barton practically built his political career &quot;on condemning the behavior of others and even on trying to make other people&#x27;s private behavior against the law ...&quot;

While Barton had no plans to resign immediately, according to a spokeswoman, and initially had said that he would run for reelection in 2018, a number of state and local politicians indicated that they might challenge him in the 2018 election for his seat. Barton hired a crisis communication firm, and said he had suffered a &quot;potential crime.&quot; Outlets including &quot;Slate&quot;, NBC and CNN opined that Barton might be a victim of revenge porn, which—though not a federal crime—is a class A misdemeanor in Texas, punishable by up to one year in county jail and up to a $4,000 fine.

Randy Bellomy, Chairman of the Ellis County Republican Party, said &quot;His lifestyle is inconsistent with Republican ideals, and he has brought disgrace not only to Ellis County and the 6th Congressional District, but also to the people of Texas and this great nation.&quot; Brian Mayes, a Dallas political consultant, said that the sexting &quot;is something you&#x27;d expect from a young, immature college kid, not a grandfather.&quot; Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey said that the case is distinguishable from that of former Congressman Anthony Weiner and his sexting scandal, but that the two controversies share one &quot;consistent message that everyone should take to heart: We should all think very hard before we post, text or otherwise share anything.&quot; Barton announced on November 30, 2017, that he would not seek reelection.

The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; ran an editorial in reaction entitled &quot;Hey Joe Barton, skipping the next election is not enough. It&#x27;s time to go.&quot; It opined that it was not appropriate for Barton – who &quot;can no longer be taken seriously&quot; – to continue to represent the 6th Congressional District for another year, until January 2019.

==Personal life==
Barton was divorced from his first wife (Jeanette/Janet Sue Winslow) in 2003. He remarried in 2004, and divorced from his second wife (Terri) in 2015. In 2017 he was again engaged. His wife Terri said she filed for divorce after evidence that Barton had engaged in multiple affairs, and finding &quot;a very sexually explicit video of one of his mistresses.&quot;

He has four children and five grandchildren. In December 2005, Barton suffered a heart attack and was taken to George Washington University Hospital.

<text>Margie Velma Barfield (née Bullard; October 29, 1932 – November 2, 1984) was an American serial killer who was convicted of one murder but eventually confessed to six murders in total. Barfield was the first woman in the United States to be executed after the 1976 resumption of capital punishment and the first since 1962. She was also the first woman to be executed by lethal injection.

==Life and murders==
Velma Barfield was born in Eastover, North Carolina, but was raised near Fayetteville. Barfield&#x27;s father reportedly was physically abusive and her mother, Lillian Bullard, did not intervene. She escaped by marrying Thomas Burke in 1949. The couple had two children and were reportedly happy until Barfield had a hysterectomy and developed back pain. These events led to a behavioral change in Barfield and an eventual drug addiction.

Burke began to drink and Barfield&#x27;s complaints turned into bitter arguments. On April 4, 1969, after Burke had passed out, Barfield and the children left the house, and when they returned, they found the structure burned and Burke dead. In 1970, Barfield married a widower, Jennings Barfield. Less than a year after their marriage, Jennings died on March 22, 1971, from heart complications.

In 1974, Lillian Bullard, Barfield&#x27;s mother, showed symptoms of intense diarrhea, vomiting and nausea, only to fully recover a few days later. Later that year, during the Christmas season, Bullard fell ill again with the same symptoms, but died in the hospital a few hours after being admitted on December 30, 1974.

In 1975, Barfield was convicted of seven counts of writing bad checks and sentenced to six months in prison. She was released after serving three months.

In 1976, Barfield began caring for the elderly, working for Montgomery and Dollie Edwards in Lumberton, North Carolina. Montgomery fell ill and died on January 29, 1977. Just over a month after the death of her husband, Dollie experienced symptoms identical to those of Bullard and died on March 1. Barfield later confessed to the murder of Dollie Edwards. The following year, Barfield took another caretaker job, this time for 76-year-old Record Lee, who had broken her leg. On June 4, 1977, Lee&#x27;s husband, John Henry, began experiencing wracking pains in his stomach and chest along with vomiting and diarrhea. He died soon afterward and Barfield later confessed to his murder.

Another victim was Rowland Stuart Taylor, Barfield&#x27;s boyfriend and a relative of Dollie Edwards. Fearing he had discovered that she had been forging checks on his account, Barfield mixed an arsenic-based rat poison into his beer and tea. Taylor died on February 3, 1978, while Barfield was &quot;trying to nurse him back to health&quot;; an autopsy found arsenic in Taylor&#x27;s system. After her arrest, the body of Jennings Barfield was exhumed and found to have traces of arsenic, a murder that Barfield denied having committed. Although she subsequently confessed to the murders of Lillian Bullard, Dollie Edwards, and John Henry Lee, she was tried and convicted only for the murder of Taylor.

Singer-songwriter Jonathan Byrd is the grandson of Jennings Barfield and his first wife. His song &quot;Velma&quot; from his &quot;Wildflowers&quot; album gives a personal account of the murders and investigation.

==Imprisonment and execution==
Barfield was imprisoned at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, in an area for escape-prone prisoners and mentally ill prisoners, as there was no designated area for women under death sentences at the time and she was the state&#x27;s only female death row inmate. A death row unit for female inmates in North Carolina was subsequently established at the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women.

During her stay on death row, Barfield became a devout Christian. Her last few years were spent ministering to prisoners, for which she received praise from Billy Graham. Barfield&#x27;s involvement in Christian ministry was extensive enough that an effort was made to obtain a commutation to life imprisonment.

A second basis for the appeal was the testimony of Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behavior, who claimed that Barfield suffered from dissociative identity disorder. Lewis testified that she had spoken to Barfield&#x27;s other personality, &quot;Billy&quot;, who told her that Velma had been a victim of sexual abuse, and that he, Billy, had killed her abusers. The judge was unconvinced. &quot;One of them did it,&quot; Lewis quoted him as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care which one.&quot;

After Barfield&#x27;s appeal was denied in federal court, she instructed her attorneys to abandon a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Barfield was executed on November 2, 1984, at Central Prison. She released a statement before the execution: &quot;I know that everybody has gone through a lot of pain, all the families connected, and I am sorry, and I want to thank everybody who have been supporting me all these six years.&quot; Barfield chose as her last meal Cheez Doodles and Coca-Cola. Barfield was buried in a small, rural North Carolina cemetery near her first husband, Thomas Burke.

Barfield&#x27;s execution raised some political controversies when Governor Jim Hunt, who was challenging incumbent Jesse Helms for his U.S. Senate seat, rejected Barfield&#x27;s request for clemency.

<text>Leuciscus is a genus of fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae. They are inland water fishes commonly called Eurasian daces. The genus is widespread from Europe to Siberia. Species broadly distributed in Europe include the common dace &quot;Leuciscus leuciscus&quot; and the ide &quot;L. idus&quot;.

The European chubs were formerly also included in &quot;Leuciscus&quot;, but they are now usually separated in another genus, &quot;Squalius&quot; (e.g. the chub, &quot;Squalius cephalus&quot;). The delimitation of &quot;Leuciscus&quot; and &quot;Squalius&quot; is not completely resolved; some species have been moved from one genus to the other only in recent years. The genera &quot;Petroleuciscus&quot; and &quot;Telestes&quot; have also been split off from &quot;Leuciscus&quot; recently; for the latter the same holds true as for &quot;Squalius&quot; regarding the unclear delimitations.

==Species==
Currently, 19 recognized species are in this genus:
* &quot;Leuciscus aspius&quot; (asp)
* &quot;Leuciscus baicalensis&quot; (Siberian dace)
* &quot;Leuciscus bearnensis&quot; (Bearn beaked dace)
* &quot;Leuciscus bergi&quot; 
* &quot;Leuciscus burdigalensis&quot; (beaked dace)
* &quot;Leuciscus chuanchicus&quot; 
* &quot;Leuciscus danilewskii&quot; (Danilevskii&#x27;s dace)
* &quot;Leuciscus dzungaricus&quot; 
* &quot;Leuciscus gaderanus&quot; 
* &quot;Leuciscus idus&quot; (ide)
* &quot;Leuciscus latus&quot; 
* &quot;Leuciscus lehmanni&quot; (Zeravshan dace)
* &quot;Leuciscus leuciscus&quot; (common dace)
* &quot;Leuciscus lindbergi&quot;

<text>The common tsessebe or sassaby (Damaliscus lunatus lunatus) is the southern, nominate subspecies of &quot;Damaliscus lunatus&quot;, although some authorities have recognised it as an independent species. It is most closely related to the Bangweulu tsessebe, sometimes also seen as a separate species, less to the topi, korrigum, coastal topi and tiang subspecies of &quot;D. lunatus&quot;, and less to the bontebok in the same genus. Common tsessebe are found in Angola, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and South Africa. 

Common tsessebe are among the fastest antelopes in Africa and can run at speeds up to 90 km/h.

==Description==
Adult tsessebe are 150 to 230 cm in length. They are quite large animals, with males weighing 137 kg and females weighing 120 kg, on average. Their horns range from 37 cm for females to 40 cm for males. For males, horn size plays an important role in territory defense and mate attraction, although horn size is not positively correlated with territorial factors of mate selection. Their bodies are chestnut brown. The fronts of their faces and their tail tufts are black; the forelimbs and thigh are greyish or bluish-black. Their hindlimbs are brownish-yellow to yellow and their bellies are white. In the wild, tsessebe usually live a maximum of 15 years, but in some areas, their average lifespan is drastically decreased due to overhunting and the destruction of habitat.

The most significant difference between the tsessebe, the southernmost subspecies, and the other topi subspecies is the incline of the horns, with the tsessebe having horns which are placed further apart from each other as one moves distally. This has the effect of the space between them having a more lunate profile when seen from a certain angle, as opposed to lyrate, more like that of a hartebeest. Tsessebe populations show variation as one moves from South Africa to Botswana, with southerly populations having on average the lightest pelage colour, smallest size and the least robust horns. Common tsessebe do not differ significantly from the Bangweulu tsessebe, the northernmost population, but in general the populations from that part of Zambia are on average the darkest-coloured and have the most robust horns, although differences are slight and individuals in both populations show variation in these characteristics which almost completely overlap each other.

==Behavior==
Tsessebe are social animals. Females form herds composed of six to 10, with their young. After males turn one year of age, they are ejected from the herd and form bachelor herds that can be as large as 30 young bulls. Territorial adult bulls form herds the same size as young bulls, although the formation of adult bull herds is mainly seen in the formation of a lek. Tsessebe declare their territory through a variety of behaviors. Territorial behavior includes moving in an erect posture, high-stepping, defecating in a crouch stance, ground-horning, mud packing, shoulder-wiping, and grunting. 

The most important aggressive display of territorial dominance is in the horning of the ground. Another far more curious form of territory marking is through the anointing of their foreheads and horns with secretions from glands near their eyes. Tsessebe accomplish this by inserting grass stems into their preorbital glands to coat them with secretion, then waving it around, letting the secretions fall onto their heads and horns. This process is not as commonly seen as ground-horning, nor is its purpose as well known.

Several of their behaviors strike scientists as peculiar. One such behavior is the habit of sleeping tsessebe to rest their mouths on the ground with their horns sticking straight up into the air. Male tsessebe has also been observed standing in parallel ranks with their eyes closed, bobbing their heads back and forth. These habits are peculiar because scientists have yet to find a proper explanation for their purposes or functions.

==Diet and habitat==
Tsessebe are primarily grazing herbivores in grasslands, open plains, and lightly wooded savannas, but they are also found in rolling uplands and very rarely in flat plains below 1500 m above sea level. Tsessebe found in the Serengeti usually feed in the morning between 8:00 and 9:00 am and in the afternoon after 4:00 pm. The periods before and after feeding are spent resting and digesting or watering during dry seasons. Tsessebe can travel up to 5 km to reach a viable water source. To avoid encounters with territorial males or females, tsessebe usually travel along territorial borders, though it leaves them open to attacks by lions and leopards.

==Breeding and reproduction==

Tsessebe reproduce at a rate of one calf per year per mating couple. Calves reach sexual maturity in two to three and half years. After mating, the gestation period of a tsessebe cow lasts seven months. The rut, or period when males start competing for females, starts in mid-February and stretches through March. The female estrous cycle is shorter, but happens in this time.

The breeding process starts with the development of a lek. Leks are established by the congregation of adult males in an area that females visit only for mating. Lekking is of particular interest since the female choice of a mate in the lek area is independent of any direct male influence. Several options are available to explain how females choose a mate, but the most interesting is in the way the male&#x27;s group in the middle of a lek. 

The grouping of males can appeal to females for several reasons. First, groups of males can protect from predators. Secondly, if males group in an area with a low food supply, it prevents competition between males and females for resources. Finally, the grouping of males provides females with a wider variety of mates to choose from, as they are all located in one central area. Dominant males occupy the center of the leks, so females are more likely to mate at the center than at the periphery of the lek.

A study by Bro-Jorgensen (2003) allowed a closer look into lek dynamics. The closer a male is to the center of the lek, the greater his mating success rate. For a male to reach the center of the lek, he must be strong enough to outcompete other males. Once a male&#x27;s territory is established in the middle of the lek, it is maintained for quite a while; even if an area opens up at the center, males rarely move to fill it unless they can outcompete the large males already present. However, maintaining central lek territory has many physical drawbacks. For example, males are often wounded in the process of defending their territory from hyenas and other males.

==Etymology==
The first known person in the Western world to record this antelope was the English painter Samuel Daniell, who painted it in &quot;Boosh-wana&quot;, and recorded it as the &quot;sassayby&quot;. The painting of the animal was first published posthumously in 1820 by his brother. William Cornwallis Harris, in his 1840 book about big game hunting, was quite familiar with the species in the Cashan Mountains and Kurrichane Hills, and renders the name as &quot;sassaybe&quot;. Sassaby had thus become the common name for this antelope in Southern Africa by the end of the 19th century. The English later recorded the Tswana name for the antelope as &quot;tsessĕbe&quot;, by 1895 it was thought that this was the origin for the anglicised word. Other names for the antelope which were recorded by Frederick Selous around this time were &quot;inkweko&quot; in the language of the Masubians of the Caprivi Strip (related to Lozi), &quot;incolomo&quot; and &quot;incomazan&quot; in the isiNdebele of &quot;Matebele&quot;, &quot;unchuru&quot; was the Sekuba name given by the Makuba of northern Botswana, &quot;inyundo&quot; by the Makalaka, and &quot;luchu&quot; or &quot;lechu&quot; by the Masaras. The antelope was recorded as called &quot;myanzi&quot; in isiZulu and the &quot;bastaard hartebeest&quot; by the Afrikaners, indeed it looks somewhat like a cross between a hartebeest and a horse. The new vernacular name &#x27;common tsessebe&#x27; was invented by Peter Grubb in 2005 to refer to &quot;Damaliscus lunatus lunatus&quot; to distinguish it from the new Bangweulu taxon.

==Conservation status==

In 1998 the IUCN estimated a total tsessebe population of 30,000, including the Bangweulu animals. It was assessed as &#x27;lower risk (conservation dependent)&#x27;. In the 2016 update to the &quot;Red List of Mammals of South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho&quot;, the minimum South African population was estimated as 2,256–2,803 individuals, of which the total minimum mature population size was 1,353–1,962; this was believed to be a significant underestimate, due to not getting enough responses from private game reserves on time for publication.

During 1980s and 1990s tsessebe populations in South Africa and Zimbabwe declined significantly, especially in the National Parks. In 1999 the populations stabilised and began to grow again, especially in private game reserves. There were a number of different theories advanced as to what was causing this decline, while other species were doing well. One 2006 theory for this decline was that woody plant encroachment was playing a primary role. As of 2016, interspecific competition is believed to have played a primary role, with the decline in tsessebe being caused by the proliferation of other antelope species, which was itself due to the opening of man-made watering holes in the game parks. Closing watering holes is believed to increase habitat heterogeneity in the parks, which would favour the tsessebe.

Initially an uncommon animal, in the 2000s the population on private game reserves in both South Africa and Zimbabwe, primarily stocked for the trophy hunting industry, began to grow quickly, with large jumps seen in the 2010s. As a large percentage of these animals are found in wild conditions in their natural areas of distribution, this is seen as contributing to the recovery of the species in South Africa. Nonetheless, there are some questions as to the potential danger of it hybridising with the also native red hartebeest which are common throughout its range, and with which hybrids have been recorded in both ranches and in National Parks. Such hybrids are likely fully fertile, and some fear such miscegenation could potentially pollute the gene pool in the future.

In northern Botswana, on the other hand, populations declined from 1996 to 2013, tsessebe populations in the Okavango Delta declined by 73%, with a 87% decline in the Moremi Game Reserve in particular. A study compared the situation with around Lake Rukwa in Tanzania in the 1950s, a paper about game populations and the elephant problem, which might create the open habitat required through their bulldozing behaviour.

==Uses==
Excess tsessebe can be bought from South African National Parks via game auctions under Section 55(2) (b) of the Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003.

Legally, tsessebe may be trophy hunted in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in the some of these countries in game management concessions, in others in game ranches and in some in both.

Tsessebe hides were formerly (1840) locally much in demand in South Africa to make a garment called a &quot;kobo&quot;, a type of leather mantle, both for the suppleness and the pleasing colour. The tail would be positioned at the back of the neck, like a ponytail, and would be opened and squeezed flat.

<doc id="938626" wikidata="Q5417348" url="?curid=938626" title="Everson v. Board of Education">
<text>Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that applied the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to state law. Before this decision, the clause, which states, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&quot;, restricted only the federal government, while many states continued to grant certain religious denominations legislative or effective privileges.

It was the first Supreme Court case incorporating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as binding upon the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

A New Jersey taxpayer brought the case against a tax-funded school district that provided reimbursement to parents of both public and private school students who took public transportation to school. The taxpayer contended that reimbursement for children attending private religious schools violated the constitutional prohibition against state support of religion, and the use of taxpayer funds to do so violated the Due Process Clause. The Justices were split over the question whether the New Jersey policy constituted support of religion, with the majority concluding that the reimbursements were &quot;separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function&quot; that they did not violate the constitution. Both affirming and dissenting Justices, however, agreed that the Constitution required a sharp separation between government and religion, and their strongly-worded opinions paved the way to a series of later court decisions that collectively brought about profound changes in legislation, public education, and other policies involving matters of religion. Both Justice Hugo Black&#x27;s majority opinion and Justice Wiley Rutledge&#x27;s dissenting opinion defined the First Amendment religious clause in terms of a &quot;wall of separation between church and state.&quot;

==Background==
After repealing a former ban, a 1941 New Jersey law authorized payment by local school boards of the costs of transportation to and from schools, including private schools, most of which were parochial Catholic schools.

Arch R. Everson, a taxpayer in Ewing Township, filed a lawsuit on state constitutional grounds. The Establishment Clause was not yet incorporated when the lawsuit was filed.

The New Jersey Supreme Court held that the provision violated the state constitution&#x27;s purpose restriction on the legislative power to authorize spending for private and parochial schools. After this decision was reversed by the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, then the state&#x27;s highest court, Everson appealed to the US Supreme Court which decided the case on federal grounds only.

==Supreme Court==
The Supreme Court handed down its 5–4 decision upholding the state law on February 10, 1947. The decision was the first to hold that the Establishment Clause was applicable against the states. It is also remembered as the first Supreme Court case to attempt an explanation of the Establishment Clause. They held that the New Jersey law providing reimbursement to transportation to all students was not a violation of the establishment clause.

===Majority opinion===
In a majority opinion by Justice Hugo Black, the Supreme Court ruled that the state bill was constitutionally permissible because the law had a &quot;public purpose&quot; to provide safe transportation to parochial school students.

The Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Establishment Clause was broad and would guide the Court&#x27;s jurisprudence for decades to come. Arthur E. Sutherland Jr. called it &quot;the most influential single announcement of the American law of church and state&quot;. Black&#x27;s language was sweeping:

The &#x27;establishment of religion&#x27; clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect &quot;&#x27;a wall of separation between Church and State.&quot;

This highly influential dictum was supported only by a historical analysis based on James Madison&#x27;s &quot;Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments&quot; and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom.

===Dissents===

Justice Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion which Justice Frankfurter joined. Justice Rutledge wrote another dissenting opinion which Justices Frankfurter, Jackson, and Burton joined. The four dissenters agreed with Justice Black&#x27;s definition of the Establishment Clause but protested that the principles that he laid down would logically lead to the invalidation of the challenged law:

The great condition of religious liberty is that it be maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences, by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation it vanishes with the resting.

==Legal scholarship==

===&quot;Wall of separation&quot;: No aid to religion===

&quot;Everson&quot; confirmed that the Supreme Court would interpret the Establishment Clause to protect against more than the establishment of a state church. The &quot;wall of separation&quot; was a principle of the founding age that prohibited any government aid to religion. The Establishment Clause would not allow any public spending &quot;to support any religious activities, or institutions whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion&quot;. 

===&quot;Public purpose&quot;: Indirect benefit===

&quot;Everson&quot; upheld the constitutionality of reimbursing the students transportation costs because the program had a public welfare purpose. The Court said that public funds could not be used &quot;to teach or practice religion.&quot; Citing &quot;Cochran v. Louisiana State Board of Education&quot;, Justice Black wrote that it was &quot;too late to argue that legislation intended to facilitate the opportunity of children to get a secular education serves no public purpose&quot;.

An &quot;indirect benefit&quot; to parochial schools did not make a statute with a legitimate secular purpose unconstitutional. The divided opinion laid the groundwork for the Lemon test which would add the primary effect and excessive entanglement criteria. 

==Legacy==

&quot;Everson&quot;&#x27;s holding incorporating the Establishment Clause was controversial and more cases followed. A few months later the Court reaffirmed this holding in the first released time case &quot;McCollum v. Board of Education&quot;. The court continued to hear cases about religion in public schools in cases like &quot;Abington v. Schempp&quot; which banned daily bible readings in public school. The American public was divided and some viewed the cases as heralding the secularization of public life in the United States.

Having invoked Jefferson&#x27;s metaphor of the wall of separation in the &quot;Everson&quot; decision, lawmakers and courts have struggled how to balance governments&#x27; dual duty to satisfy the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment. The majority and dissenting Justices in &quot;Everson&quot; split over the question, with Rutledge in the minority by insisting that the Constitution forbids &quot;every form of public aid or support for religion.&quot;

Writing for the majority in &quot;McCollum&quot;, Justice Black defended the &quot;Everson&quot; holding and the &quot;wall of separation&quot; dictum. The four Justices who dissented in &quot;Everson&quot;—Justices Harold H. Burton, Felix Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson, Wiley Rutledge— were reluctant to endorse the &quot;McCollum&quot; ruling. The Court&#x27;s historical argument was reaffirmed in subsequent cases including &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot;, &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; and &quot;McGowan v. Maryland&quot;.

<doc id="938631" wikidata="Q156530" url="?curid=938631" title="Antineutron">
<text>The antineutron is the antiparticle of the neutron with symbol . It differs from the neutron only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. It has the same mass as the neutron, and no net electric charge, but has opposite baryon number (+1 for neutron, −1 for the antineutron). This is because the antineutron is composed of antiquarks, while neutrons are composed of quarks. The antineutron consists of one up antiquark and two down antiquarks.

==Background ==

The antineutron was discovered in proton–antiproton collisions at the Bevatron (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) by the team of Bruce Cork, Glen Lambertson, Oreste Piccioni, and William Wenzel in 1956, one year after the antiproton was discovered.

Since the antineutron is electrically neutral, it cannot easily be observed directly. Instead, the products of its annihilation with ordinary matter are observed. In theory, a free antineutron should decay into an antiproton, a positron, and a neutrino in a process analogous to the beta decay of free neutrons. There are theoretical proposals of neutron–antineutron oscillations, a process that implies the violation of the baryon number conservation.

==Magnetic moment==
The magnetic moment of the antineutron is the opposite of that of the neutron. It is for the antineutron but for the neutron (relative to the direction of the spin). Here &quot;μ&quot;N is the nuclear magneton.

<text>Dulce María Sauri Riancho (born 14 August 1951) is a Mexican politician who was the first woman to serve as governor of Yucatán, from 1991 through 1994. She served as a congresswoman during the 64th Congress (2018–2021), during which she was also the President of the Chamber of Deputies (equivalent to the Speaker of the House in other countries). During her tenure as governor, reforms which restructured the Henequen industry in Yucatán were implemented. The toll road between Mérida and Cancún was also built and became operational during her administration.

==Life and political career==
Dulce María Sauri was born in Mérida, Yucatán, in 1951. She studied sociology at the &quot;Universidad Iberoamericana&quot;. Between 1977 and 1982, she worked in the Federal Public Administration in various capacities: Social Programming Technical Assistance Plan (1975–1977); State of Coahuila, 
Ministry of Programming and Budget (1977–1979); Outreach Program Coordinator for Integrated Rural Development Programme (PIDER) (1979–1982) and head of Ministry of Planning and Budget Evaluation Unit for Yucatán (1979–1982).

She has been an active member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since 1981. She has served in the Congress of Yucatán and as federal deputy in the lower house of Congress (for Yucatán&#x27;s fourth district, 1982–85). Between 1988 and 1991, she served in the Senate, representing Yucatán. After her tenure as governor of Yucatán (1991–1994), she returned to the lower house of Congress between 1994 and 1996. She served as the coordinator of the National Programme for Women between 1995–2000 and simultaneously served on the National Commission for Women between 1996 and 1999. She served as the president of the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM) of the Organization of American States from 1998–2000.

Sauri became national president of the PRI in 1999 and though she lost the presidency in the 2000 election, she refused to step down and remained as party president until 2002. Sauri served in the upper house of the federal Congress from 2000 to 2006. During her tenure in the Senate, she served as Chair of the Asia Pacific Foreign Relations Committee. She was also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the North American Foreign Relations Committee, and the Finance and Public Credit Committee.

In the 2018 general election she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a proportional representation deputy for the third electoral region.

<doc id="938648" wikidata="Q528894" url="?curid=938648" title="Marlon Devonish">
<text>Marlon Ronald Devonish, (born 1 June 1976) is an English former sprinter who competed in the 100 metres and 200 metres. A prodigious relay runner with particular strength as a &#x27;bend&#x27; runner, Devonish ran the third leg for the Great Britain quartet which won the 4 x 100 metres at the 2004 Olympic Games, and won four World Championship medals in the same event in 1999, 2005, 2007 and 2009.

==Early life==
Devonish attended Caludon Castle School in Coventry, where his athletic talent was first discovered by his P.E. teacher Timothy Coleman who took him to Coventry Godiva Harriers athletics club.

==Career==
He is a member of the Coventry Godiva Harriers athletics club and was coached by Tony Lester. Early in his career he was successful at both 100 and 200-metre distances, winning English Schools and European Junior titles at both, but in later years he concentrated mostly on the longer distance. He was also a regular member of both the British and, at the Commonwealth Games, English 4 x 100-metre sprint relay teams, to some considerable success. He is a current Commonwealth Games record holder in the relay event.

The most notable achievement of his career came at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. There Devonish, along with Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell and Mark Lewis-Francis, won a gold medal in the 4x100m. relay, where the quartet defeated the pre-race favourites, United States team, by just 0.01 seconds, in a season&#x27;s best of 38.07.

At the British Championships (and team trials for the 2006 European Championships) in July 2006, Devonish became the first man since Linford Christie in 1988 to win both the 100 m and 200 m races at the event. At the championship finals, he took the bronze medal in the 200 m.

Devonish retained his 100 m title at the British Championships the following year. For the 2007 season Devonish improved his performance in the 100 m with a new personal best and competed in this event at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka rather than the 200 m which he had previously specialised in. Devonish finished 6th in the 100 m final.

Devonish represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He competed at the 4x100 metres relay together with Simeon Williamson, Tyrone Edgar and Craig Pickering. In their qualification heat they were disqualified and eliminated. He also took part in the 200 metres individual, finishing first with a time of 20.49 seconds in his first round heat. With 20.43 seconds in his second round he only placed fourth in his heat, but his time was among the four best losing times and enough to qualify for the semi-finals. There he came to 20.57 seconds and the seventh time in his race, which was not enough for the final.

He competed at the 2009 Manchester City Games, finishing second in the 150 metres final in 15.07 seconds. He was beaten by Usain Bolt who ran a world best-beating time.

On 22 August 2009, Devonish was a member of the Great Britain and Northern Ireland men&#x27;s 4x100m relay team that took bronze at the IAAF World Championships in Berlin with a season&#x27;s best of 38.02. Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Simeon Williamson and Tyrone Edgar ran the other legs.

==Post-athletics==
On 16 July 2013, Devonish was brought in as sprint coach for Gloucester Rugby at Kingsholm Stadium, Gloucester.

On 8 January 2018, Devonish started working for the British International School Shanghai located in Puxi, Shanghai, China as their elite athlete performance coach in residence.

<text>In computer programming, a statement is a syntactic unit of an imperative programming language that expresses some action to be carried out. A program written in such a language is formed by a sequence of one or more statements. A statement may have internal components (e.g. expressions).

Many programming languages (e.g. Ada, Algol 60, C, Java, Pascal) make a distinction between statements and definitions/declarations. A definition or declaration specifies the data on which a program is to operate, while a statement specifies the actions to be taken with that data.

Statements which cannot contain other statements are &quot;simple&quot;; those which can contain other statements are &quot;compound&quot;.

The appearance of a statement (and indeed a program) is determined by its syntax or grammar. The meaning of a statement is determined by its semantics.

==Simple statements==
Simple statements are complete in themselves; these include assignments, subroutine calls, and a few statements which may significantly affect the program flow of control (e.g. goto, return, stop/halt). In some languages, input and output, assertions, and exits are handled by special statements, while other languages use calls to predefined subroutines.

* assignment
**Fortran: codice_1
**Pascal, Algol 60, Ada: codice_2
**C, C#, C++, PHP, Java: codice_3
* call
**Fortran: codice_4
**C, C++, Java, PHP, Pascal, Ada: codice_5
* assertion
**C, C++, PHP: codice_6
**Java: codice_7
* goto
**Fortran: codice_8
**Algol 60: codice_9
**C, C++, PHP, Pascal: codice_9
* return
**Fortran: codice_11
**C, C++, Java, PHP: codice_12
* stop/halt/exit
**Fortran: codice_13
**C, C++: codice_14
**PHP: codice_15

==Compound statements==

Compound statements may contain (sequences of) statements, nestable to any reasonable depth, and generally involve tests to decide whether or not to obey or repeat these contained statements.

::Notation for the following examples:
::* is any single statement (could be simple or compound).
::* is any sequence of zero or more 
::Some programming languages provide a general way of grouping statements together, so that any single can be replaced by a group:

::* Algol 60: codice_16
::* Pascal: codice_16
::* C, PHP, Java: codice_18

::Other programming languages have a different special terminator on each kind of compound statement, so that one or more statements are automatically treated as a group:
::* Ada: 

Many compound statements are loop commands or choice commands. In theory only one of each of these types of commands is required. In practice there are various special cases which occur quite often; these may make a program easier to understand, may make programming easier, and can often be implemented much more efficiently. There are many subtleties not mentioned here; see the linked articles for details.

* count-controlled loop:
** Algol 60: codice_19
** Pascal: 
** C, Java: 
** Ada: 
** Fortran 90:
* condition-controlled loop with test at start of loop:
** Algol 60: codice_20
** Pascal: 
** C, Java: 
** Ada: 
** Fortran 90: 
* condition-controlled loop with test at end of loop:
** Pascal: 
** C, Java: 
** Ada: 
* condition-controlled loop with test in the middle of the loop:
** C: 
** Ada: 
* if-statement simple situation:
** Algol 60:codice_21
** Pascal: 
** C, Java: 
** Ada: 
** Fortran 77+: 
* if-statement two-way choice:
** Algol 60: codice_22
** Pascal: 
** C, Java: 
** Ada: 
** Fortran 77+: 
* case/switch statement multi-way choice:
** Pascal: 
** Ada: 
** C, Java: 
* Exception handling:
** Ada: codice_23
** Java: codice_24
** Python: codice_25

==Syntax==

Apart from assignments and subroutine calls, most languages start each statement with a special word (e.g. goto, if, while, etc.) as shown in the above examples. Various methods have been used to describe the form of statements in different languages; the more formal methods tend to be more precise:

* Algol 60 used Backus–Naur form (BNF) which set a new level for language grammar specification.
* Up until Fortran 77, the language was described in English prose with examples, From Fortran 90 onwards, the language was described using a variant of BNF.
* Cobol used a two-dimensional metalanguage.
* Pascal used both syntax diagrams and equivalent BNF.
BNF uses recursion to express repetition, so various extensions have been proposed to allow direct indication of repetition.

===Statements and keywords===

Some programming language grammars reserve keywords or mark them specially, and do not allow them to be used as identifiers. This often leads to grammars which are easier to parse, requiring less lookahead.

====No distinguished keywords====

Fortran and PL/1 do not have reserved keywords, allowing statements like:

* in PL/1:
**codice_26 (the second codice_27 and the first codice_28 are variables).
* in Fortran:
**codice_29 conditional statement (with other variants)
**codice_30 assignment to a subscripted variable named codice_27
::As spaces were optional up to Fortran 95, a typo could completely change the meaning of a statement:
:*codice_32 start of a loop with I running from 1 to 5
:*codice_33 assignment of the value 1.5 to the variable codice_34

====Flagged words====
In Algol 60 and Algol 68, special tokens were distinguished explicitly: for publication, in boldface e.g. codice_35; for programming, with some special marking, e.g., a flag (codice_36), quotation marks (codice_37), or underlined (codice_35 on the Elliott 503). This is called &quot;stropping&quot;.

Tokens that are part of the language syntax thus do not conflict with programmer-defined names.

====Reserved keywords====

Certain names are reserved as part of the programming language and can not be used as programmer-defined names.
The majority of the most popular programming languages use reserved keywords. Early examples include FLOW-MATIC (1953) and COBOL (1959). Since 1970 other examples include Ada, C, C++, Java, and Pascal. The number of reserved words depends on the language: C has about 30 while COBOL has about 400.

==Semantics==
Semantics is concerned with the meaning of a program. The standards documents for many programming languages use BNF or some equivalent to express the syntax/grammar in a fairly formal and precise way, but the semantics/meaning of the program is generally described using examples and English prose. This can result in ambiguity. In some language descriptions the meaning of compound statements is defined by the use of &#x27;simpler&#x27; constructions, e.g. a while loop can be defined by a combination of tests, jumps, and labels, using codice_39 and codice_40.

The semantics article describes several mathematical/logical formalisms which have been used to specify semantics in a precise way; these are generally more complicated than BNF, and no single approach is generally accepted as the way to go. Some approaches effectively define an interpreter for the language, some use formal logic to reason about a program, some attach affixes to syntactic entities to ensure consistency, etc.

==Expressions==
A distinction is often made between statements, which are executed, and expressions, which are evaluated. Expressions always evaluate to a value, which statements do not. However, expressions are often used as part of a larger statement.

In most programming languages, a statement can consist of little more than an expression, usually by following the expression with a statement terminator (semicolon). In such a case, while the expression evaluates to a value, the complete statement does not (the expression&#x27;s value is discarded). For instance, in C, C++, C#, and many similar languages, codice_41 is an expression that will set x to the value of y plus one, and the whole expression itself will evaluate to the same value that x is set to. However, codice_42 (note the semicolon at the end) is a statement that will still set x to the value of y plus one because the expression within the statement is still evaluated, but the result of the expression is discarded, and the statement itself does not evaluate to any value.

Expressions can also be contained within other expressions. For instance, the expression codice_41 contains the expression codice_44, which in turn contains the values codice_45 and codice_46, which are also technically expressions.

Although the previous examples show assignment expressions, some languages do not implement assignment as an expression, but rather as a statement. A notable example of this is Python, where = is not an operator, but rather just a separator in the assignment statement. Although Python allows multiple assignments as each assignment were an expression, this is simply a special case of the assignment statement built into the language grammar rather than a true expression.

==Extensibility==

Most languages have a fixed set of statements defined by the language, but there have been experiments with extensible languages that allow the programmer to define new statements.

<doc id="938659" wikidata="Q159914" url="?curid=938659" title="Vertical deflection">
<text>The vertical deflection (VD) or deflection of the vertical (DoV), also known as deflection of the plumb line and astro-geodetic deflection, is a measure of how far the gravity direction at a given point of interest is rotated by local mass anomalies such as nearby mountains. They are widely used in geodesy, for surveying networks and for geophysical purposes.

The vertical deflection are the angular components between the true zenith–nadir curve (plumb line) tangent line and the normal vector to the surface of the reference ellipsoid (chosen to approximate the Earth&#x27;s sea-level surface). VDs are caused by mountains and by underground geological irregularities and can amount to angles of 10″ in flat areas or 20–50″ in mountainous terrain.

The deflection of the vertical has a north–south component &quot;ξ&quot; (xi) and an east–west component &quot;η&quot; (eta). The value of &quot;ξ&quot; is the difference between the &quot;astronomic latitude&quot; and the &quot;geodetic latitude&quot; (taking north latitudes to be positive and south latitudes to be negative); the latter is usually calculated by geodetic network coordinates. The value of &quot;η is&quot; the product of cosine of latitude and the difference between the &quot;astronomic longitude&quot; and the longitude (taking east longitudes to be positive and west longitudes to be negative). When a new mapping datum replaces the old, with new geodetic latitudes and longitudes on a new ellipsoid, the calculated vertical deflections will also change.

==Determination==
The deflections reflect the undulation of the geoid and gravity anomalies, for they depend on the gravity field and its inhomogeneities.

Vertical deflections are usually determined astronomically. The &quot;true zenith&quot; is observed astronomically with respect to the stars, and the &quot;ellipsoidal zenith&quot; (theoretical vertical) by geodetic network computation, which always takes place on a reference ellipsoid. Additionally, the very local variations of the vertical deflection can be computed from gravimetric survey data and by means of digital terrain models (DTM), using a theory originally developed by Vening-Meinesz.

VDs are used in astrogeodetic levelling: as a vertical deflection describes the difference between the geoidal vertical direction and ellipsoidal normal direction, it represents the horizontal spatial gradient of the geoid undulations of the geoid (i.e., the inclination between geoid and reference ellipsoid).

In practice, the deflections are observed at special points with spacings of 20 or 50 kilometers. The densification is done by a combination of DTM models and areal gravimetry. Precise vertical deflection observations have accuracies of ±0.2″ (on high mountains ±0.5″), calculated values of about 1–2″.

The maximal vertical deflection of Central Europe seems to be a point near the Großglockner (3,798 m), the highest peak of the Austrian Alps. The approx. values are ξ = +50″ and η = −30″. In the Himalaya region, very asymmetric peaks may have vertical deflections up to 100″ (0.03°). In the rather flat area between Vienna and Hungary the values are less than 15&quot;, but scatter by ±10″ for irregular rock densities in the subsurface.

More recently, a combination of digital camera and tiltmeter have also been used, see zenith camera.

==Application==
Vertical deflections are principally used in four matters:
# For precise calculation of survey networks. The geodetic theodolites and levelling instruments are oriented with respect to the true vertical, but its deflection exceeds the geodetic measuring accuracy by a factor of 5 to 50. Therefore, the data would have to be corrected exactly with respect to the global ellipsoid. Without these reductions, the surveys may be distorted by some centimeters or even decimeters per km.
# For the geoid determination (mean sea level) and for exact transformation of elevations. The global geoidal undulations amount to 50–100 m, and their regional values to 10–50 m. They are adequate to the integrals of VD components ξ,η and therefore can be calculated with cm accuracy over distances of many kilometers.
# For GPS surveys. The satellites measurements refer to a pure geometrical system (usually the WGS84 ellipsoid), whereas the terrestrial heights refer to the geoid. We need accurate geoid data to combine the different types of measurements.
# For geophysics. Because VD data are affected by the physical structure of the Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle, geodesists are engaged in models to improve our knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s interior. Additionally and similar to &quot;applied geophysics&quot;, the VD data can support the future exploration of raw materials, oil, gas or ores.

==Historical implications==
Vertical deflections were used to measure Earth&#x27;s density in the Schiehallion experiment.

Vertical deflection is the reason why modern prime meridian passes more than 100 m to the east of the historical astronomic prime meridian in Greenwich.

The meridian arc measurement made by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille north of Cape Town in 1752 (de Lacaille&#x27;s arc measurement) was affected by vertical deflection. The resulting discrepancy with Northern Hemisphere measurements was not explained until a visit to the area by George Everest in 1820; Maclear&#x27;s arc measurement resurvey ultimately confirmed Everest&#x27;s conjecture.

Errors in the meridian arc of Delambre and Méchain determination, which affected the original definition of the metre, were long known to be mainly caused by an uncertain determination of Barcelona&#x27;s latitude later explained by vertical deflection. When these errors where acknowledged in 1866, it became urgent to proceed to a new measurement of the French arc between Dunkirk and Perpignan. The operations concerning the revision of the French arc linked to Spanish triangulation were completed only in 1896. Meanwhile, the French geodesists had accomplished in 1879 the junction of Algeria to Spain, with the help of the geodesists of the Madrid Institute headed by the late Carlos Ibañez Ibáñez de Ibero (1825–1891).

Until Hayford ellipsoid was calculated in 1910, vertical deflections were considered as random errors. Plumb line deviations were identified by Jean Le Rond d&#x27;Alembert as an important source of error in geodetic surveys as early as 1756. A few years later, in 1828, Carl Friedrich Gauss proposed the concept of geoid.

<doc id="938663" wikidata="Q6934509" url="?curid=938663" title="Multi-task learning">
<text>Multi-task learning (MTL) is a subfield of machine learning in which multiple learning tasks are solved at the same time, while exploiting commonalities and differences across tasks. This can result in improved learning efficiency and prediction accuracy for the task-specific models, when compared to training the models separately. 
Inherently, Multi-task learning is a multi-objective optimization problem having trade-offs between different tasks.
Early versions of MTL were called &quot;hints&quot;.

In a widely cited 1997 paper, Rich Caruana gave the following characterization:Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better.

In the classification context, MTL aims to improve the performance of multiple classification tasks by learning them jointly. One example is a spam-filter, which can be treated as distinct but related classification tasks across different users. To make this more concrete, consider that different people have different distributions of features which distinguish spam emails from legitimate ones, for example an English speaker may find that all emails in Russian are spam, not so for Russian speakers. Yet there is a definite commonality in this classification task across users, for example one common feature might be text related to money transfer. Solving each user&#x27;s spam classification problem jointly via MTL can let the solutions inform each other and improve performance. Further examples of settings for MTL include multiclass classification and multi-label classification.

Multi-task learning works because regularization induced by requiring an algorithm to perform well on a related task can be superior to regularization that prevents overfitting by penalizing all complexity uniformly. One situation where MTL may be particularly helpful is if the tasks share significant commonalities and are generally slightly under sampled. However, as discussed below, MTL has also been shown to be beneficial for learning unrelated tasks.

==Methods==
The key challenge in multi-task learning, is how to combine learning signals from multiple tasks into a single model. This may strongly depend on how well different task agree with each other, or contradict each other. There are several ways to address this challenge: 

===Task grouping and overlap===
Within the MTL paradigm, information can be shared across some or all of the tasks. Depending on the structure of task relatedness, one may want to share information selectively across the tasks. For example, tasks may be grouped or exist in a hierarchy, or be related according to some general metric. Suppose, as developed more formally below, that the parameter vector modeling each task is a linear combination of some underlying basis. Similarity in terms of this basis can indicate the relatedness of the tasks. For example, with sparsity, overlap of nonzero coefficients across tasks indicates commonality. A task grouping then corresponds to those tasks lying in a subspace generated by some subset of basis elements, where tasks in different groups may be disjoint or overlap arbitrarily in terms of their bases. Task relatedness can be imposed a priori or learned from the data. Hierarchical task relatedness can also be exploited implicitly without assuming a priori knowledge or learning relations explicitly. For example, the explicit learning of sample relevance across tasks can be done to guarantee the effectiveness of joint learning across multiple domains.

===Exploiting unrelated tasks===
One can attempt learning a group of principal tasks using a group of auxiliary tasks, unrelated to the principal ones. In many applications, joint learning of unrelated tasks which use the same input data can be beneficial. The reason is that prior knowledge about task relatedness can lead to sparser and more informative representations for each task grouping, essentially by screening out idiosyncrasies of the data distribution. Novel methods which builds on a prior multitask methodology by favoring a shared low-dimensional representation within each task grouping have been proposed. The programmer can impose a penalty on tasks from different groups which encourages the two representations to be orthogonal. Experiments on synthetic and real data have indicated that incorporating unrelated tasks can result in significant improvements over standard multi-task learning methods.

=== Transfer of knowledge ===
Related to multi-task learning is the concept of knowledge transfer. Whereas traditional multi-task learning implies that a shared representation is developed concurrently across tasks, transfer of knowledge implies a sequentially shared representation. Large scale machine learning projects such as the deep convolutional neural network GoogLeNet, an image-based object classifier, can develop robust representations which may be useful to further algorithms learning related tasks. For example, the pre-trained model can be used as a feature extractor to perform pre-processing for another learning algorithm. Or the pre-trained model can be used to initialize a model with similar architecture which is then fine-tuned to learn a different classification task.

=== Multiple non-stationary tasks ===
Traditionally Multi-task learning and transfer of knowledge are applied to stationary learning settings. Their extension to non-stationary environments is termed &quot;Group online adaptive learning&quot; (GOAL). Sharing information could be particularly useful if learners operate in continuously changing environments, because a learner could benefit from previous experience of another learner to quickly adapt to their new environment. Such group-adaptive learning has numerous applications, from predicting financial time-series, through content recommendation systems, to visual understanding for adaptive autonomous agents.

=== Multi-task optimization ===

Multitask optimization: In some cases, the simultaneous training of seemingly related tasks may hinder performance compared to single-task models. Commonly, MTL models employ task-specific modules on top of a joint feature representation obtained using a shared module. Since this joint representation must capture useful features across all tasks, MTL may hinder individual task performance if the different tasks seek conflicting representation, i.e., the gradients of different tasks point to opposing directions or differ significantly in magnitude. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as negative transfer. To mitigate this issue, various MTL optimization methods have been proposed. Commonly, the per-task gradients are combined into a joint update direction through various aggregation algorithms or heuristics.

== Mathematics ==

=== Reproducing Hilbert space of vector valued functions (RKHSvv) ===
The MTL problem can be cast within the context of RKHSvv (a complete inner product space of vector-valued functions equipped with a reproducing kernel). In particular, recent focus has been on cases where task structure can be identified via a separable kernel, described below. The presentation here derives from Ciliberto et al., 2015.

==== RKHSvv concepts ====
Suppose the training data set is formula_1, with formula_2, formula_3, where indexes task, and formula_4. Let formula_5. In this setting there is a consistent input and output space and the same loss function formula_6 for each task: . This results in the regularized machine learning problem: 
\sum _{t=1} ^T \frac{1}{n_t} \sum _{i=1} ^{n_t} \mathcal{L}(y_i^t, f_t(x_i^t))+\lambda ||f||_\mathcal{H} ^2 &lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_7 is a vector valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space with functions formula_8 having components formula_9.

The reproducing kernel for the space formula_7 of functions formula_11 is a symmetric matrix-valued function formula_12 , such that formula_13 and the following reproducing property holds: 
 &lt;/math&gt;|}} The reproducing kernel gives rise to a representer theorem showing that any solution to equation has the form: 
==== Separable kernels ====
The form of the kernel induces both the representation of the feature space and structures the output across tasks. A natural simplification is to choose a &quot;separable kernel,&quot; which factors into separate kernels on the input space and on the tasks formula_14. In this case the kernel relating scalar components formula_15 and formula_16 is given by formula_17. For vector valued functions formula_18 we can write formula_19, where is a scalar reproducing kernel, and is a symmetric positive semi-definite formula_20 matrix. Henceforth denote formula_21 .

This factorization property, separability, implies the input feature space representation does not vary by task. That is, there is no interaction between the input kernel and the task kernel. The structure on tasks is represented solely by . Methods for non-separable kernels is a current field of research.

For the separable case, the representation theorem is reduced to formula_22. The model output on the training data is then , where is the formula_23 empirical kernel matrix with entries formula_24, and is the formula_25 matrix of rows formula_26.

With the separable kernel, equation can be rewritten as

 V(Y,KCA) + \lambda tr(KCAC^{\top})&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where is a (weighted) average of applied entry-wise to and . (The weight is zero if formula_27 is a missing observation).

Note the second term in can be derived as follows:

:formula_28

==== Known task structure ====

===== Task structure representations =====
There are three largely equivalent ways to represent task structure: through a regularizer; through an output metric, and through an output mapping.


===== Task structure examples =====
Via the regularizer formulation, one can represent a variety of task structures easily. 
* Letting formula_29 (where formula_30 is the &quot;T&quot;x&quot;T&quot; identity matrix, and formula_31 is the &quot;T&quot;x&quot;T&quot; matrix of ones) is equivalent to letting control the variance formula_32 of tasks from their mean formula_33. For example, blood levels of some biomarker may be taken on patients at formula_34 time points during the course of a day and interest may lie in regularizing the variance of the predictions across patients. 
* Letting formula_35 , where formula_36 is equivalent to letting formula_37 control the variance measured with respect to a group mean: formula_38. (Here formula_39 the cardinality of group r, and formula_40 is the indicator function). For example, people in different political parties (groups) might be regularized together with respect to predicting the favorability rating of a politician. Note that this penalty reduces to the first when all tasks are in the same group.
* Letting formula_41, where formula_42 is the Laplacian for the graph with adjacency matrix &quot;M&quot; giving pairwise similarities of tasks. This is equivalent to giving a larger penalty to the distance separating tasks &quot;t&quot; and &quot;s&quot; when they are more similar (according to the weight formula_43,) i.e. formula_44 regularizes formula_45.
* All of the above choices of A also induce the additional regularization term formula_46 which penalizes complexity in f more broadly.

==== Learning tasks together with their structure ====
Learning problem can be generalized to admit learning task matrix A as follows:
Choice of formula_47 must be designed to learn matrices &quot;A&quot; of a given type. See &quot;Special cases&quot; below.

===== Optimization of =====
Restricting to the case of convex losses and coercive penalties Ciliberto &quot;et al.&quot; have shown that although is not convex jointly in &quot;C&quot; and &quot;A,&quot; a related problem is jointly convex.

Specifically on the convex set formula_48, the equivalent problem

is convex with the same minimum value. And if formula_49 is a minimizer for then formula_50 is a minimizer for .

 may be solved by a barrier method on a closed set by introducing the following perturbation:

The perturbation via the barrier formula_51 forces the objective functions to be equal to formula_52 on the boundary of formula_53 .

 can be solved with a block coordinate descent method, alternating in &quot;C&quot; and &quot;A.&quot; This results in a sequence of minimizers formula_54 in that converges to the solution in as formula_55, and hence gives the solution to .

===== Special cases =====
Spectral penalties - Dinnuzo &quot;et al&quot; suggested setting &quot;F&quot; as the Frobenius norm formula_56. They optimized directly using block coordinate descent, not accounting for difficulties at the boundary of formula_57.

Clustered tasks learning - Jacob &quot;et al&quot; suggested to learn &quot;A&quot; in the setting where &quot;T&quot; tasks are organized in &quot;R&quot; disjoint clusters. In this case let formula_58 be the matrix with formula_59. Setting formula_60, and formula_61, the task matrix formula_62 can be parameterized as a function of formula_63: formula_64 , with terms that penalize the average, between clusters variance and within clusters variance respectively of the task predictions. M is not convex, but there is a convex relaxation formula_65. In this formulation, formula_66.

===== Generalizations =====
Non-convex penalties - Penalties can be constructed such that A is constrained to be a graph Laplacian, or that A has low rank factorization. However these penalties are not convex, and the analysis of the barrier method proposed by Ciliberto et al. does not go through in these cases.

Non-separable kernels - Separable kernels are limited, in particular they do not account for structures in the interaction space between the input and output domains jointly. Future work is needed to develop models for these kernels.

<text>Jean-Thomas &quot;Tomi&quot; Ungerer (; 28 November 1931 – 9 February 2019) was a French artist and writer from Alsace (a French region on the French/German border). He published over 140 books ranging from children&#x27;s books to adult works and from the fantastic to the autobiographical. He was known for sharp social satire and witty aphorisms. Ungerer is also famous as a cartoonist and designer of political posters and film posters.

Ungerer received the international Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1998 for his &quot;lasting contribution&quot; as a children&#x27;s illustrator.

== Biography ==
Ungerer was born in Strasbourg in Alsace, France, the youngest of four children to Alice (Essler) and Theo Ungerer. The family moved to Logelbach, near Colmar, after the death of Tomi&#x27;s father, Theodore—an artist, engineer, and astronomical clock manufacturer—in 1936. Ungerer also lived through the German occupation of Alsace when the family home was requisitioned by the Wehrmacht.

As a young man, Ungerer was inspired by the illustrations appearing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, particularly the work of Saul Steinberg. In 1957, the year after he moved to the U.S., Harper &amp; Row published his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Mellops Go Flying&quot;, and his second, &quot;The Mellops Go Diving for Treasure&quot;; by the early 1960s he had created at least ten children&#x27;s picture books with Harper, plus a few others, and had illustrated some books by other writers. He also did illustration work for publications including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Esquire, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and for television during the 1960s, and began to create posters denouncing the Vietnam War.

Maurice Sendak called &quot;Moon Man&quot; (1966) &quot;easily one of the best picture books in recent years.&quot; After &quot;&quot;, subtitled &quot;With Due Respect to Hans Christian Andersen, the Grimm Brothers, and the Honorable Ambrose Bierce&quot; in 1974, he ceased writing children&#x27;s books, focusing instead on adult-level books, many of which concern sexuality. He eventually returned to children&#x27;s literature with &quot;Flix&quot; in 1998. Ungerer donated many of the manuscripts and artwork for his early children&#x27;s books to the Children&#x27;s Literature Research Collection at the Free Library of Philadelphia.

A consistent theme in Ungerer&#x27;s illustrations is his support for European construction, beginning with Franco-German reconciliation in his home region of Alsace, and in particular European values of tolerance and diversity. In 2003, he was named Ambassador for Childhood and Education by the 47-nation Council of Europe.

In 2007, his home town dedicated a museum to him, the &quot;Musée Tomi Ungerer/Centre international de l’illustration&quot;.

Ungerer divided his time between Ireland, where he and his wife had moved in 1976, and Strasbourg. In addition to his work as a graphic artist and &#x27;drawer&#x27;, he was also a designer, toy collector and &quot;archivist of human absurdity.&quot;

A biographical documentary film, &quot;Far Out Isn&#x27;t Far Enough: The Tomi Ungerer Story&quot;, was produced in 2012. The film was featured at the 2013 Palm Springs International Film Festival. In 2015–2016, the Kunsthaus Zurich and the Museum Folkwang in Essen devoted a large exhibition to Ungerer&#x27;s artistic oeuvre and in particular his collages. A comprehensive book has been published by Philipp Keel from Diogenes with essays by Tobias Burg, Cathérine Hug and Thérèse Willer.

Ungerer died on 9 February 2019 in Cork, Ireland, aged 87.
== Work ==
Tomi Ungerer described himself first and foremost as a story teller and satirist. Prevalent themes in his work include political satire (such as drawings and posters against the Vietnam War and against animal cruelty), eroticism, and imaginative subjects for children&#x27;s books. Ungerer&#x27;s publications are held by the German National Library, including:

<text>John Stanislaus Joyce (4 July 1849 – 29 December 1931) was the father of writer James Joyce, and a well known Dublin man about town. The son of James and Ellen (&quot;née&quot; O&#x27;Connell) Joyce, John Joyce grew up in Cork, where his mother&#x27;s family, which claimed kinship to &quot;Liberator&quot; Daniel O&#x27;Connell, was quite prominent.

Baptised in St. Finbarr&#x27;s South Church, Joyce grew up in the Anglesea Street area. He attended St Colman&#x27;s College, Fermoy, from 1859 and later studied medicine at The Queen&#x27;s College, Cork, from 1867. However, he did not complete his university studies.

Following his father&#x27;s death in 1866, Joyce inherited substantial property around Cork. Soon after he moved to Dublin, where he worked for several years as secretary at a distillery company. He was noted as a fine tenor singer, although he never pursued a musical career.

On 5 May 1880, Joyce married Mary &quot;May&quot; Murray. That year, as a reward for his work supporting Liberal candidates in the General Election of 1880, Joyce was given a post in the Dublin Custom House.

In 1882, his son James was born, the first of ten surviving children. From eldest to youngest, names and ages given according to the 1901 census: James Augustine (aged 19 in 1901), Margaret Alice (17), John Stanislaus (16), Chales [sic] Patrick (14), George Alfred (13), Eileen (12), May Kathleen (11), Eva May (10), Florence (9) and Mabel (8).

Over the next ten years, Joyce gradually ran through his property. A supporter of the nationalist politician Charles Stewart Parnell, Joyce was crushed by what he saw as Parnell&#x27;s betrayal and death following the revelation of his adultery with Kitty O&#x27;Shea. He remained a committed Parnellite and benefited from the patronage of political colleagues in later life when he had few other sources of income.

By the time of Parnell&#x27;s death in 1891, Joyce had spent most of his inheritance and had been pensioned from his post at the custom house. A spendthrift, he proved barely able to live on the small pension that was left to him, and spent much of his time drinking. His wife died in 1903, but despite his poor management of the household, he managed to outlive her by 28 years. He died at the age of 82.

Of all his children, Joyce got along well only with his eldest, James, who enjoyed his father&#x27;s company and shared in some of his traits, including his musical talent and his inability with money. John Joyce inspired several characters in his son&#x27;s works, such as Simon Dedalus in &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, and the narrator&#x27;s uncle in the stories &quot;The Sisters&quot; and &quot;Araby&quot; in &quot;Dubliners&quot;.

<text>The Jewish Museum in Bucharest, Romania is located in the former Templul Unirea Sfântă (United Holy Temple) synagogue, which survived World War II.

The name has several variants, including &quot;Museum of the History of the Romanian Jewish Community&quot;. In Romanian it is variously called &quot;Muzeul de Istorie al Comunitatilor Evreiești din România&quot;, &quot;Muzeul de Istorie a Comunitații Evreiești București&quot; etc.

The museum gives broad coverage of the history of the Jews in Romania. Displays include an enormous collection of books written, published, illustrated, or translated by Romanian Jews; a serious archive of the history of Romanian Jewry; a collection of paintings of and by Romanian Jews that, while relatively small, consists of works of a calibre worthy of a major art museum (many of the same artists&#x27; works hang in the National Museum of Art); memorabilia from Jewish theaters including the State Jewish Theater; a medium-sized display devoted to Zionism; a small but pointed display of anti-Semitic posters and tracts; two rooms off to a side, one dealing with the Holocaust era from a historical point of view, the other a Holocaust memorial; discussion of both favorable and unfavorable treatment of the Jews by various of Romania&#x27;s historic rulers; in short, a museum devoted to looking seriously at the history of a particular ethnic group within a society. In contrast to its Hungarian equivalent in Budapest, this is not a museum that sees the exodus of the majority of the country&#x27;s surviving Jews to Israel as a culmination: this museum is focused more on what that means for those who have stayed, what is the continuing contribution of Jews to Romanian culture, what has been, what is, and what will be the role of Jews in Romania.

The Museum also contains a large collection of Jewish ritual objects from Romania, collected by Rabbi Moses Rosen (1912–1994), the late Chief Rabbi of the Romanian Jewry.

<text>George Hedley Vicars Bulyea (February 17, 1859 – July 22, 1928) was a Canadian politician and the first Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. As the youngest ever Lieutenant Governor, at age 46, he was appointed by Governor General Earl Grey on advice of Prime Minister of Canada Sir Wilfrid Laurier on September 1, 1905.

He spent many years in the service of the territorial and provincial governments and played an important role in the early history of the Province of Alberta.

==Early life==
George Hedley Vicars Bulyea was born on February 17, 1859, in Gagetown, Queen&#x27;s County, New Brunswick, to James Albert Bulyea, and Jane Blizzard, two prosperous farmers. Bulyea was a descendant of United Empire Loyalists, with his great-grandparents being born in New York. James Albert Bulyea served as a captain with the 1st Battalion of the Queens County Militia, headquartered in Gagetown, his birthplace.

He was educated at the Gagetown Grammar School and graduated from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, in 1878, with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was first in his class with honors in mathematics and French.

After graduation from university, Bulyea decided to pursue a teaching career. He served as principal of the Sheffield Grammar School, Sudbury County, New Brunswick, from 1878, until 1882. In 1883, he moved to Western Canada, and settled initially in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 1883, he moved to Qu&#x27;Appelle, District of Assiniboia, North-West Territories (now Saskatchewan), a town just east of Regina. Up until 1898, he worked as a merchant, in which he dealt flour and feed. He served as the first treasurer of Qu&#x27;Appelle, when it was formed as a municipality, in 1886.

On January 29, 1885, he married Annie Blanche Babbit, the second daughter of Robert Thorne Babbit, Registrar of Queens County, New Brunswick. They had one son in 1885, Percy McFarlane Bulyea, who died at the age of fifteen on February 5, 1901, of a paralytic affliction. The Bulyeas were active members of the Baptist Church.

==Political career==
In the 1891 Northwest Territories election, he ran as an unsuccessful candidate for a seat to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories for the riding of South Qu&#x27;Appelle. He ran successfully for the same seat in 1894, and was elected in the 1894 Election. He was re-elected to the same position in 1898, and 1902 On October 7, 1897, he became a Member of the first Executive Council of the Northwest Territories which administered the affairs of the area that presently comprises Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon. He was re-elected by acclamation at a by-election on October 26, 1897. In 1898, he was appointed Special Commissioner to the Territories, serving in that capacity until the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created in 1905. During the period 1898 to 1905, he also served as Administrator of Territorial Affairs in the Yukon for one year. He was reelected to the Northwest Territories Assembly at the 1898 Northwest Territories election and again, by acclamation, in 1902 Northwest Territories election. George H.V. Bulyea was appointed Commissioner of Agriculture and Territorial Secretary in the Haultain government on January 12, 1899, relinquishing the agriculture portfolio in February, 1903, to become Commissioner of Public Works. Along with Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, he represented the territorial government in the negotiations with Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the federal Cabinet on the issue of provincial status.

===Lieutenant governor===
On the advice of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Bulyea was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta effective September 1, 1905, the date that Alberta became a province. This appointment was made by Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada. During Bulyea&#x27;s period of service as Lieutenant Governor his Secretaries were G. H. Babbit and A .C. Gillespie.

In 1910, Bulyea presided over the resignation of Premier A. C. Rutherford following the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal. He passed over the candidates of two rival factions in the Liberal government&#x27;s caucus to promote, and finally name, Alberta&#x27;s Chief Justice Arthur Sifton as Rutherford&#x27;s successor. This decisive action helped put matters to rest.

The Lieutenant Governor also played a sensitive role in the internal politics of the provincial Liberal Party. The dynamics of federal and provincial political parties were not as clearly delineated then as they are today. The selection of such a prominent Liberal and an active political figure for the first Lieutenant Governor suggests that Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier expected that Bulyea would play an assertive role in developing the politics of the new Province. However, the role of the Office has since evolved into a non-partisan and largely symbolic position. Bulyea was appointed Lieutenant Governor for a second term and continued to serve in that capacity until his successor was appointed effective October 20, 1915. Following his service as Lieutenant Governor, Bulyea was appointed chairman of Alberta&#x27;s Board of Public Utilities on November 20, 1915.

In 1908, Bulyea received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of Alberta and the University of New Brunswick. While living in Edmonton, he was a member of the Edmonton Club and the Edmonton Golf and Country Club.

==Later life==
After the completion of his second term as Lieutenant Governor, he was appointed the first chair of Alberta&#x27;s Board of Publicity Utility Commissioners, in which he would remain until 1923, when he would resign, due to ill health. After retirement, the Bulyeas moved, and settled in Peachland, British Columbia, where they had previously resided during summers, at their four-hectare fruit orchard and summer home. He was a shareholder in the Peachland Townsite Company and was involved in negotiations for the sale of its irrigation system.

He was an active member of the Edmonton Club, and Edmonton Golf and Country Club, while living in Edmonton.

===Death===
Bulyea died on July 22, 1928, in Peachland, British Columbia, after a long illness. A service was held on July 24, at the United Church, in Qu&#x27;Appelle, Saskatchewan, where he was later interred in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Cemetery. His wife, Annie was interred alongside him, when she died in 1934.

<text>The National Museum of Art of Romania () is located in the Royal Palace in Revolution Square, central Bucharest. It features collections of medieval and modern Romanian art, as well as the international collection assembled by the Romanian royal family.

The exhibition &quot;Shadows and Light&quot; ran from 15 July to 2 October 2005. With four centuries of French art, it was the largest exhibition of French painting in Central and Eastern Europe since 1945. 77 works were exhibited, including masterpieces by painters such as Poussin, Chardin, Ingres, David, Delacroix, Corot, Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso, and Braque.

==History==
The museum was damaged during the 1989 Romanian Revolution that led to the downfall of Nicolae Ceaușescu. In 2000, part of the museum reopened to the public, housing the modern Romanian collection and the international collection; the comprehensive Medieval art collection, which now features works salvaged from monasteries destroyed during the Ceaușescu era, reopened in spring 2002. There are also two halls that house temporary exhibits.

The modern Romanian collection features sculptures by Constantin Brâncuși and Dimitrie Paciurea, as well as paintings by Theodor Aman, Nicolae Grigorescu, Theodor Pallady, Gheorghe Petrașcu, and Gheorghe Tattarescu.

The international collection includes works by Old Masters such as Domenico Veneziano, El Greco, Tintoretto, Jan van Eyck, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, and Rembrandt, plus a smattering of works by impressionists such as Claude Monet and Alfred Sisley. Among the best known Old Master works in the collection are Jacopo Amigoni&#x27;s portrait of the singer Farinelli, a &quot;Crucifixion&quot; by Antonello da Messina, and Alonso Cano&#x27;s &quot;Christ at the Column&quot;.

==Exhibitions==

In the southern part of the building the European Museum Art Gallery was reopened in 2000. The painting collection was made available on the basis of 214 works of art from the collection of King Carol I, to which were added pictures of other members of the royal family. The king&#x27;s collection included paintings by El Greco, Rembrandt, Bruegel the Elder, Rubens, and Domenico Veneziano.

In spring 2001, the Romanian Modern Art Gallery reopened. The paintings are displayed on the mezzanine and second floor wing of the building. Early Romanian paintings are exhibited on the mezzanine (, Eustație Altini, Anton Chladek, Niccolò Livaditti, Giovanni Schiavoni, Carol Wallenstein de Vella, Constantin Daniel Rosenthal, Ion Negulici, Constantin Lecca, Carol Szathmari), along with portraits of family members and a few landscapes. 
In the Modern Romanian Section, the following painters are also represented:
* Nicolae Grigorescu
* Stefan Luchian
* Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck
* Nicolae Tonitza
* Herman Maxy
* Victor Brauner
Other noteworthy non-Romanian paintings are:
* Bernardino Licinio&#x27;s &quot;Return of Prodigal Son&quot;
* Hans von Aachen&#x27;s &quot;3 Graces&quot;
* Aegidius Sadeler&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Hradcany&quot;
* Bartholomäus Zeitblom&#x27;s &quot;Saint Barbara&quot;
* Claude Monet&#x27;s &quot;Camille in Green Dress&quot;

<doc id="938689" wikidata="Q75617" url="?curid=938689" title="Petite bourgeoisie">
<text>Petite bourgeoisie (, literally &#x27;small bourgeoisie&#x27;; also anglicised as petty bourgeoisie) is a term that refers to a social class composed of small business owners, shopkeepers, small-scale merchants, semi-autonomous peasants, and artisans. They are named as such because their politico-economic ideological stance in times of stability is reflective of the proper &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot; (high bourgeoisie or upper class). In ordinary times, the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; seek to identify themselves with the &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot;, whose bourgeois morality, conduct and lifestyle they aspire and strive to imitate.

The term, which goes as far back as the Revolutionary period in France, if not earlier, is politico-economic and addresses historical materialism. It originally denoted a sub-stratum of the middle classes in the 18th and early-19th centuries of western Europe. In the mid-19th century, the German economist Karl Marx and other Marxist theorists used the term &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; to academically identify the socio-economic stratum of the bourgeoisie that consists of small shopkeepers and self-employed artisans.

== Definition ==

The &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; is economically distinct from the proletariat and the social-class strata who rely entirely on the sale of their labour-power for survival. It is also distinct from the capitalist class &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot; (&#x27;high&#x27; bourgeoisie), defined by owning the means of production and thus deriving most of their wealth from buying the labour-power of the proletariat and to work the means of production. Although members of the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; can buy the labour of others, they typically work alongside their employees, unlike the &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot;. Examples can include shopkeepers, artisans and other smaller-scale entrepreneurs.

The &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; is little-defined in Marx&#x27;s own work, with only the words &#x27;smaller capitalists&#x27; used in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;.

== Role in fascism ==
Historically, Karl Marx predicted that the petite bourgeoisie was to lose in the course of economic development. The [petty bourgeoise] sink[s] gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production.The livelihood of the petit bourgeoise is thus threatened. Competition with the big bourgeoise and simultaneous pressures from the proletariat leaves them in a precarious position. Marx acknowledges the petit bourgeoise, still, want to preserve the existing relations of property and cannot be revolutionary like the proletariat.

Marxist theorists say that the instability of the petit bourgeoise, when augmented in times of crisis, leads to its attraction to forms of government such as fascism. Trotsky concluded:The fascists find their human material mainly in the petty bourgeoisie. The latter has been entirely ruined by big capital. There is no way out for it in the present social order, but it knows of no other. Its dissatisfaction, indignation, and despair are diverted by the fascists away from big capital and against the workers. It may be said that fascism is the act of placing the petty bourgeoisie at the disposal of its most bitter enemies. In this way, big capital ruins the middle classes and then, with the help of hired fascist demagogues, incites the despairing petty bourgeoisie against the worker.Daniel Guerin concluded:The middle classes, caught between menacing big business and an aggressive working class, have become enraged and turned toward fascism.This was disputed by historian Richard Pipes who wrote, in the case of the Nazi Party, that while at first limited to this group, by the end of the 1920s workers joined the party en masse and were the largest occupational group in the party by 1934.

Wilhelm Reich also highlighted the principal support of the rise of fascism in Germany given by the petite bourgeoisie and middle class in &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot;. He claimed that the middle classes were a hotbed for political reaction due to their reliance on the patriarchal family (according to Reich, small businesses are often self-exploiting enterprises of families headed by the father, whose morality binds the family together in their somewhat precarious economic position) and the sexual repression that underlies it.

== Literary treatment of the petite bourgeoisie ==

Søren Kierkegaard wrote that &quot;the petty bourgeois is spiritless[.] ... Devoid of imagination, as the petty bourgeois always is, he lives within a certain orbit of trivial experiences as to how things come about, what is possible, what usually happens, no matter whether he is a tapster or a prime minister. This is the way the petty bourgeois has lost himself and God&quot;. According to him, the petite bourgeoisie exemplifies a spiritual emptiness that is rooted in an overemphasis on the worldly, rather than the inwardness of the self. However, Kierkegaard&#x27;s indictment relies less on a class analysis of the petite bourgeoisie than on the perception of a worldview which was common in his middle-class milieu.
In fact, though there have been many depictions of the petite bourgeoisie in literature as well as in cartoons, based on an image of their overly conventional practicality, the realities of the petite bourgeoisie throughout the 19th century were more complex. All the same, writers have been concerned with petite bourgeois morality and behavior and have portrayed them as undesirable characters. Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; was a play written in direct response to the reception of another one of his plays for making &quot;indecent&quot; references to syphilis and in general his work was considered scandalous in its disregard for the morality of the period. Later, Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s concern with Nazism and his Marxist politics got him interested in exploring the petite bourgeois mind and this interest led him to represent the petite bourgeoisie repeatedly throughout his work (one was even titled &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins of the Petite Bourgeoisie&quot;).

In his book &quot;Two Cheers for Anarchism: Six Easy Pieces on Autonomy, Dignity, and Meaningful Work and Play&quot;, James C. Scott dedicates an entire chapter to describing some features of the petite bourgeoisie. First, he points out the contempt of this class by Marxists due to the ambiguity of their political position. He further points out that this position of contempt or distaste encompasses both the socialist bloc and large capitalist democracies, due to the difficulty of monitoring, taxing and policing of this class. This difficulty results from the complexity, variety and mobility of activities taken on by this class. He points out the petite bourgeoisie has existed for most of civilized history. He also states that even those who are not part of the class have to some degree desired to become small property owners, due to the conferred autonomy and social standing. He continues that the desire to keep and restore lost land has been the leitmotif of most radically egalitarian mass movements. He argues that the petite bourgeoisie have an indispensable economic role in terms of invention and innovation, citing as an example software startups that develop ideas which are then usually bought by larger firms. He also points out that small shopkeepers provide several &quot;unpaid&quot; social services such as:

<doc id="938699" wikidata="Q266923" url="?curid=938699" title="Kingdom of Mysore">
<text>The Kingdom of Mysore was a geopolitical realm in southern India founded in around 1399 in the vicinity of the modern-day city of Mysore and prevailed until 1950. The territorial boundaries and the form of government transmuted substantially throughout the kingdom&#x27;s lifetime. While originally a feudal vassal under the Vijayanagara Empire, it became a princely state in British Raj from 1799 to 1947, marked in-between by major political changes.

The kingdom, which was founded and ruled for the most part by the Wadiyars, initially served as a feudal vassal under the Vijayanagara Empire. With the gradual decline of the Empire, the 16th-century Timmaraja Wodeyar II declared independence from it. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, during the rules of Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Devaraja Wodeyar II, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, becoming a formidable power in the Deccan.

During a brief Muslim rule from 1761 to 1799, the kingdom became a sultanate under Hyder Ali and Tipu, often referring to it as Sultanat-e-Khudadad (). It also ruled the Amindivi Islands of Lakshdweep (which was later annexed by the East India Company). During this time, it came into conflict with the Maratha Confederacy, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Kingdom of Travancore, and the British, culminating in four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Mysore&#x27;s success in the First Anglo-Mysore war and a stalemate in the Second were followed by defeats in the Third and the Fourth. Following Tipu&#x27;s death in the Fourth War during the Siege of Seringapatam, large parts of his kingdom were annexed by the British, which signalled the end of a period of Tipu over South India. Power returned absolutely to the Wadiyars when Krishnaraja Wodeyar III became king.

In 1831, the British took direct control of the kingdom and a commission administered it until 1881. Through an instrument of rendition, power was once again transferred to the Wadiyars in 1881, when Chamaraja Wadiyar X was made king. In 1913, in lieu of the instrument, a proper subsidiary alliance was struck with the kingdom during Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV.

Upon India&#x27;s independence from the Crown rule in 1947, the Kingdom of Mysore acceded to the Union of India. Upon accession, it became Mysore State, later uniting with other Kannada speaking regions to form the present-day Karnataka state. Soon after Independence, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar was made Rajapramukh until 1956, when he became the first governor of the enlarged state.

Even as a princely state, Mysore came to be counted among the more developed and urbanised regions of South Asia. The period since the penultimate restoration (1799–1947) also saw Mysore emerge as one of the important centres of art and culture in India. The maharajas of Mysore were not only accomplished exponents of the fine arts and men of letters, they were enthusiastic patrons as well. Their legacies continue to influence music and the arts even today, as well as rocket science with the use of Mysorean rockets.

==History==

===Early history===
Sources for the history of the kingdom include numerous extant lithic and copper plate inscriptions, records from the Mysore palace and contemporary literary sources in Kannada, Persian and other languages. According to traditional accounts, the kingdom originated as a small state based in the modern city of Mysore and was founded by two brothers, Yaduraya (also known as Vijaya) and Krishnaraya. Their origins are mired in legend and are still a matter of debate; while some historians posit a northern origin at Dwarka, others locate it in Karnataka. Yaduraya is said to have married Chikkadevarasi, the local princess and assumed the feudal title &quot;Wodeyar&quot; (), which the ensuing dynasty retained. The first unambiguous mention of the Wodeyar family is in 16th century Kannada literature from the reign of the Vijayanagara king Achyuta Deva Raya (1529–1542); the earliest available inscription, issued by the Wodeyars themselves, dates to the rule of the petty chief Timmaraja II in 1551.

===Autonomy: advances and reversals===
The kings who followed ruled as vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire until the decline of the latter in 1565. By this time, the kingdom had expanded to thirty-three villages protected by a force of 300 soldiers. King Timmaraja II conquered some surrounding chiefdoms, and King &quot;Bola&quot; Chamaraja IV (&quot;lit&quot;, &quot;Bald&quot;), the first ruler of any political significance among them, withheld tribute to the nominal Vijayanagara monarch Aravidu Ramaraya. After the death of Aravidu Ramaraya, the Wodeyars began to assert themselves further and King Raja Wodeyar I wrested control of Srirangapatna from the Vijayanagara governor (&quot;Mahamandaleshvara&quot;) Aravidu Tirumalla – a development which elicited, if only &quot;ex post facto&quot;, the tacit approval of Venkatapati Raya, the incumbent king of the diminished Vijayanagar Empire ruling from Chandragiri. Raja Wodeyar I&#x27;s reign also saw territorial expansion with the annexation of Channapatna to the north from Jaggadeva Raya – a development which made Mysore a regional political factor to reckon with.

Consequently, by 1612–13, the Wodeyars exercised a great deal of autonomy and even though they acknowledged the nominal overlordship of the Aravidu dynasty, tributes and transfers of revenue to Chandragiri stopped. This was in marked contrast to other major chiefs, the &quot;Nayaks&quot; of Tamil country who continued to pay off Chandragiri emperors well into the 1630s. Chamaraja VI and Kanthirava Narasaraja I attempted to expand further northward but were thwarted by the Bijapur Sultanate and its Maratha subordinates, though the Bijapur armies under Ranadullah Khan were effectively repelled in their 1638 siege of Srirangapatna. Expansionist ambitions then turned southward into Tamil country where Narasaraja Wodeyar acquired Satyamangalam (in modern northern Erode district) while his successor Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar expanded further to capture western Tamil regions of Erode and Dharmapuri, after successfully repulsing the chiefs of Madurai. The invasion of the Keladi Nayakas of Malnad was also dealt with successfully. This period was followed by one of the complex geo-political changes when in the 1670s, the Marathas and the Mughals pressed into the Deccan.

Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), the most notable of Mysore&#x27;s early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further expand territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur to the north and the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for a fair share of land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja&#x27;s attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the &quot;Nayaka&quot; chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (&quot;Rajas&quot;) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.

Nevertheless, from around 1704, when the kingdom passed on to the &quot;Mute king&quot; (&quot;Mukarasu&quot;) Kanthirava Narasaraja II, the survival and expansion of the kingdom was achieved by playing a delicate game of alliance, negotiation, subordination on occasion, and annexation of territory in all directions. According to historians Sanjay Subrahmanyam and Sethu Madhava Rao, Mysore was now formally a tributary of the Mughal Empire. Mughul records claim a regular tribute (&quot;peshkash&quot;) was paid by Mysore. However, historian Suryanath U. Kamath feels the Mughals may have considered Mysore an ally, a situation brought about by Mughal–Maratha competition for supremacy in southern India. By the 1720s, with the Mughal empire in decline, further complications arose with the Mughal residents at both Arcot and Sira claiming tribute. The years that followed saw Krishnaraja Wodeyar I tread cautiously on the matter while keeping the Kodagu chiefs and the Marathas at bay. He was followed by Chamaraja Wodeyar VII during whose reign power fell into the hands of prime minister (&quot;Dalwai&quot; or &quot;Dalavoy&quot;) Nanjarajiah (or Nanjaraja) and chief minister (&quot;Sarvadhikari&quot;) Devarajiah (or Devaraja), the influential brothers from Kalale town near Nanjangud who would rule for the next three decades with the Wodeyars relegated to being the titular heads. The latter part of the rule of Krishnaraja II saw the Deccan Sultanates being eclipsed by the Mughals and in the confusion that ensued, Hyder Ali, a captain in the army, rose to prominence. His victory against the Marathas at Bangalore in 1758, resulting in the annexation of their territory, made him an iconic figure. In honour of his achievements, the king gave him the title &quot;Nawab Haider Ali Khan Bahadur&quot;.

===Under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan===

Hyder Ali has earned an important place in the history of Karnataka for his fighting skills and administrative acumen. The rise of Hyder came at a time of important political developments in the sub-continent. While the European powers were busy transforming themselves from trading companies to political powers, the Nizam as the &quot;Subahdar&quot; of the Mughals pursued his ambitions in the Deccan, and the Marathas, following their defeat at Panipat, sought safe havens in the south. The period also saw the French vie with the British for control of the Carnatic—a contest in which the British would eventually prevail as British commander Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French under the Comte de Lally at the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760, a watershed in Indian history as it cemented British supremacy in South Asia. Though the Wodeyars remained the nominal heads of Mysore during this period, real power lay in the hands of Hyder Ali and his son Tipu.

By 1761, Maratha power had diminished and by 1763, Hyder Ali had captured the Keladi kingdom, defeated the rulers of Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar Coast in the south and conquered the Zamorin&#x27;s capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider&#x27;s meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent—a challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome.

In a bid to stem Hyder&#x27;s rise, the British allied with the Marathas and the Nizam of Golconda, culminating in the First Anglo-Mysore War in 1767. Despite numerical superiority, Hyder Ali suffered defeats at the battles of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai. The British ignored his overtures for peace until Hyder Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras (modern Chennai) and was able to successfully sue for peace. Three wars were fought from 1764 and 1772 between the Maratha armies of Peshwa Madhavrao I against Hyder, in which Hyder was severely defeated and had to pay 36 lacs of tribute as war expenses along with an annual tribute of 14 lacs every year to the peshwa. In these wars Hyder had expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but the British betrayed him by staying out of the conflict. The British betrayal and Hyder&#x27;s subsequent defeat reinforced Hyder&#x27;s deep distrust of the British—a sentiment that would be shared by his son and one that would inform Anglo-Mysore rivalries of the next three decades. In 1777, Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and parts of what would later become Malabar District from the Marathas.
Haider Ali&#x27;s army advanced towards the Marathas and fought them at the Battle of Saunshi and came out victorious during the same year.

By 1779, Hyder Ali had captured parts of modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south, extending the Kingdom&#x27;s area to about 80,000 mi2 (205,000 km2). In 1780, he befriended the French and made peace with the Marathas and the Nizam. However, Hyder Ali was betrayed by the Marathas and the Nizam, who made treaties with the British as well. In July 1779, Hyder Ali headed an army of 80,000, mostly cavalry, descending through the passes of the Ghats amid burning villages, before laying siege to British forts in northern Arcot starting the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Hyder Ali had some initial successes against the British notably at Pollilur, the worst defeat the British suffered in India until Chillianwala, and Arcot, until the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote, when the fortunes of the British began to change. On 1 June 1781 Coote struck the first heavy blow against Hyder Ali in the decisive Battle of Porto Novo. The battle was won by Coote against odds of five to one and is regarded as one of the greatest feats of the British in India. It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur (the scene of an earlier triumph of Hyder Ali over a British force) on 27 August, in which the British won another success, and by the rout of the Mysore troops at Sholinghur a month later. Hyder Ali died on 7 December 1782, even as fighting continued with the British. He was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan who continued hostilities against the British by recapturing Baidanur and Mangalore.

By 1783 neither the British nor Mysore were able to obtain a clear overall victory. The French withdrew their support of Mysore following the peace settlement in Europe. Undaunted, Tipu, popularly known as the &quot;Tiger of Mysore&quot;, continued the war against the British but lost some regions in modern coastal Karnataka to them. The Maratha–Mysore War occurred between 1785 and 1787 and consisted of a series of conflicts between the Sultanate of Mysore and the Maratha Empire. Following Tipu Sultan&#x27;s victory against the Marathas at the siege of Bahadur Benda, a peace agreement was signed between the two kingdoms with mutual gains and losses. Similarly, the treaty of Mangalore was signed in 1784 bringing hostilities with the British to a temporary and uneasy halt and restoring the others&#x27; lands to the status quo ante bellum. The treaty is an important document in the history of India because it was the last occasion when an Indian power dictated terms to the British, who were made to play the role of humble supplicants for peace. A start of fresh hostilities between the British and French in Europe would have been sufficient reason for Tipu to abrogate his treaty and further his ambition of striking at the British. His attempts to lure the Nizam, the Marathas, the French and the Sultan of Turkey failed to bring direct military aid.

Tipu&#x27;s successful attacks in 1790 on the Kingdom of Travancore, a later British ally, ended in defeat for him, and it resulted in greater hostilities with the British which culminated in the Third Anglo-Mysore War. In the beginning, the British made gains, taking the Coimbatore district, but Tipu&#x27;s counterattack reversed many of these gains. By 1792, with aid from the Marathas who attacked from the north-west and the Nizam who moved in from the north-east, the British under Lord Cornwallis successfully besieged Srirangapatna, resulting in Tipu&#x27;s defeat and the Treaty of Srirangapatna. Half of Mysore was distributed among the allies, and two of his sons were held to ransom. A humiliated but indomitable Tipu went about rebuilding his economic and military power. He attempted to covertly win over support from Revolutionary France, the Amir of Afghanistan, the Ottoman Empire and Arabia. However, these attempts to involve the French soon became known to the British, who were at the time fighting the French in Egypt and were backed by the Marathas and the Nizam. In 1799, Tipu died defending Srirangapatna in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, heralding the end of the Kingdom&#x27;s independence. Modern Indian historians consider Tipu Sultan an inveterate enemy of the British, an able administrator and an innovator.

===Princely state===

Following Tipu&#x27;s fall, a part of the kingdom of Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam. The remaining territory was transformed into a Princely State; the five-year-old scion of the Wodeyar family, Krishnaraja III, was installed on the throne with Purnaiah continuing as Dewan, who had earlier served under Tipu, handling the reins as regent and Barry Close was appointed the British Resident for Msyore. The British then took control of Mysore&#x27;s foreign policy and also exacted an annual tribute and a subsidy for maintaining a standing British army at Mysore. As dewan, Purnaiah distinguished himself with his progressive and innovative administration until he retired from service in 1811 (and died shortly thereafter) following the 16th birthday of the boy king.
The years that followed witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro, determined after a personal investigation in 1825 that there was no substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the Nagar revolt (a civil insurrection) which broke out towards the end of the decade changed things considerably. In 1831, close on the heels of the insurrection and citing mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state, placing it under a commission rule. For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well-developed state.
In 1876–77, however, towards the end of the period of direct British rule, Mysore was struck by a devastating famine with estimated mortality figures ranging between 700,000 and 1,100,000, or nearly a fifth of the population. Shortly thereafter, Maharaja Chamaraja X, educated in the British system, took over the rule of Mysore in 1881, following the success of a lobby set up by the Wodeyar dynasty that was in favour of rendition. Accordingly, a resident British officer was appointed at the Mysore court and a Dewan to handle the Maharaja&#x27;s administration. From then onwards, until Indian independence in 1947, Mysore remained a Princely State within the British Indian Empire, with the Wodeyars continuing their rule.

After the demise of Maharaja Chamaraja X, Krishnaraja IV, still a boy of eleven, ascended the throne in 1895. His mother Maharani Kemparajammanniyavaru ruled as regent until Krishnaraja took over the reins on 8 February 1902. Under his rule, with Sir M. Visvesvayara as his Dewan, the Maharaja set about transforming Mysore into a progressive and modern state, particularly in industry, education, agriculture and art. Such were the strides that Mysore made that Mahatma Gandhi called the Maharaja a &quot;saintly king&quot; (&quot;Rajarishi&quot;). Paul Brunton, the British philosopher and orientalist, John Gunther, the American author, and British statesman Lord Samuel praised the ruler&#x27;s efforts. Much of the pioneering work in educational infrastructure that took place during this period would serve Karnataka invaluably in the coming decades. The Maharaja was an accomplished musician, and like his predecessors, avidly patronised the development of the fine arts. He was followed by his nephew Jayachamarajendra whose rule continued for some years after he signed the instrument of accession and Mysore joined the Indian Union on 9 August 1947. Jayachamarajendra continued to rule as Rajapramukh of Mysore until 1956 when as a result of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, his position was converted into Governor of Mysore State. From 1963 until 1966, he was the first Governor of Madras State.

==Administration==
There are no records relating to the administration of the Mysore territory during the Vijayanagara Empire&#x27;s reign (1399–1565). Signs of a well-organised and independent administration appear from the time of Raja Wodeyar I who is believed to have been sympathetic towards peasants (&quot;raiyats&quot;) who were exempted from any increases in taxation during his time. The first sign that the kingdom had established itself in the area was the issuing of gold coins (&quot;Kanthirayi phanam&quot;) resembling those of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire during Narasaraja Wodeyar&#x27;s rule.

The rule of Chikka Devaraja saw several reforms effected. Internal administration was remodelled to suit the kingdom&#x27;s growing needs and became more efficient. A postal system came into being. Far-reaching financial reforms were also introduced. Several petty taxes were imposed in place of direct taxes, as a result of which the peasants were compelled to pay more by way of land tax. The king is said to have taken a personal interest in the regular collection of revenues the treasury burgeoned to 90,000,000 &quot;Pagoda&quot; (a unit of currency) – earning him the epithet &quot;Nine crore Narayana&quot; (&quot;Navakoti Narayana&quot;). In 1700, he sent an embassy to Aurangazeb&#x27;s court bestowed upon him the title &quot;Jug Deo Raja&quot; and awarded permission to sit on the ivory throne. Following this, he founded the district offices (&quot;Attara Kacheri&quot;), the central secretariat comprising eighteen departments, and his administration was modelled on Mughal lines.

During Hyder Ali&#x27;s rule, the kingdom was divided into five provinces (&quot;Asofis&quot;) of unequal size, comprising 171 taluks (&quot;Paraganas&quot;) in total. When Tipu Sultan became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler, the kingdom, which encompassed (62,000 mi2), was divided into 37 provinces and a total of 124 taluks (&quot;Amil&quot;). Each province had a governor (&quot;Asof&quot;), and one deputy governor. Each taluk had a headman called &quot;Amildar&quot; and a group of villages were in charge of a &quot;Patel&quot;. The central administration comprised six departments headed by ministers, each aided by an advisory council of up to four members.

When the princely state came under direct British rule in 1831, early commissioners Lushington, Briggs and Morrison were followed by Mark Cubbon, who took charge in 1834. He made Bangalore the capital and divided the princely state into four divisions, each under a British superintendent. The state was further divided into 120 taluks with 85 taluk courts, with all lower level administration in the Kannada language. The office of the commissioner had eight departments; revenue, post, police, cavalry, public works, medical, animal husbandry, judiciary and education. The judiciary was hierarchical with the commissioners&#x27; court at the apex, followed by the &quot;Huzur Adalat&quot;, four superintending courts and eight &quot;Sadar Munsiff&quot; courts at the lowest level. Lewin Bowring became the chief commissioner in 1862 and held the position until 1870. During his tenure, the property &quot;Registration Act&quot;, the &quot;Indian Penal Code&quot; and &quot;Code of Criminal Procedure&quot; came into effect and the judiciary was separated from the executive branch of the administration. The state was divided into eight districts – Bangalore, Chitraldroog, Hassan, Kadur, Kolar, Mysore, Shimoga, and Tumkur.

After the rendition, C. V. Rungacharlu was made the Dewan. Under him, the first Representative Assembly of British India, with 144 members, was formed in 1881. He was followed by K. Seshadri Iyer in 1883 during whose tenure gold mining at the Kolar Gold Fields began, the Shivanasamudra hydroelectric project was initiated in 1899 (the first such major attempt in India) and electricity and drinking water (the latter through pipes) was supplied to Bangalore. Seshadri Iyer was followed by P. N. Krishnamurti, who created The Secretariat Manual to maintain records and the Co-operative Department in 1905, V. P. Madhava Rao who focussed on the conservation of forests and T. Ananda Rao, who finalised the Kannambadi Dam project.

Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, popularly known as the &quot;Maker of Modern Mysore&quot;, holds a key place in the history of Karnataka. An engineer by education, he became the Dewan in 1909. Under his tenure, membership of the Mysore Legislative Assembly was increased from 18 to 24, and it was given the power to discuss the state budget. The Mysore Economic Conference was expanded into three committees; industry and commerce, education, and agriculture, with publications in English and Kannada. Important projects commissioned during his time included the construction of the Kannambadi Dam, the founding of the Mysore Iron Works at Bhadravathi, founding of the Mysore University in 1916, the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bangalore, the establishment of the Mysore state railway department and numerous industries in Mysore. In 1955, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour.

Sir Mirza Ismail took office as Dewan in 1926 and built on the foundation laid by his predecessor. Amongst his contributions were the expansion of the Bhadravathi Iron Works, the founding of a cement and paper factory in Bhadravathi and the launch of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. A man with a penchant for gardens, he founded the Brindavan Gardens (Krishnaraja Sagar) and built the Kaveri River high-level canal to irrigate in modern Mandya district.

In 1939 Mandya District was carved out of Mysore District, bringing the number of districts in the state to nine.

==Economy==
The vast majority of the people lived in villages and agriculture was their main occupation. The economy of the kingdom was based on agriculture. Grains, pulses, vegetables and flowers were cultivated. Commercial crops included sugarcane and cotton. The agrarian population consisted of landlords (&quot;vokkaliga&quot;, &quot;zamindar&quot;, &quot;heggadde&quot;) who tilled the land by employing several landless labourers, usually paying them in grain. Minor cultivators were also willing to hire themselves out as labourers if the need arose. It was due to the availability of these landless labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as palaces, temples, mosques, anicuts (dams) and tanks. Because land was abundant and the population relatively sparse, no rent was charged on land ownership. Instead, landowners paid tax for cultivation, which amounted to up to one-half of all harvested produce.

===Under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan===
Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu&#x27;s rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centres within the kingdom.

The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.

=== Under British rule ===

This system changed under the subsidiary alliance with the British, when tax payments were made in cash and were used for the maintenance of the army, police and other civil and public establishments. A portion of the tax was transferred to England as the &quot;Indian tribute&quot;. Unhappy with the loss of their traditional revenue system and the problems they faced, peasants rose in rebellion in many parts of south India. After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms came into effect. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who improved the economic conditions of the masses. However, the homespun textile industry suffered while most of India was under British rule, except the producers of the finest cloth and the coarse cloth which was popular with the rural masses. This was due to the manufacturing mills of Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional handweaving industry, especially in spinning and weaving.

The economic revolution in England and the tariff policies of the British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout British India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called &quot;kambli&quot;. This economic fallout led to the formation of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.

==Culture==

===Religion===

The early kings of the Wodeyar dynasty worshipped the Hindu god Shiva. The later kings, starting from the 17th century, took to Vaishnavism, the worship of the Hindu god Vishnu. According to musicologist Meera Rajaram Pranesh, King Raja Wodeyar I was a devotee of the god Vishnu, King Dodda Devaraja was honoured with the title &quot;Protector of Brahmins&quot; (&quot;Deva Brahmana Paripalaka&quot;) for his support to Brahmins, and Maharaja Krishnaraja III was devoted to the goddess Chamundeshwari (a form of Hindu goddess Durga). Wilks (&quot;History of Mysore&quot;, 1800) wrote about a &quot;Jangama&quot; (Veerashaiva saint-devotee of Shiva) uprising, related to excessive taxation, which was put down firmly by Chikka Devaraja. Historian D.R. Nagaraj claims that four hundred &quot;Jangamas&quot; were murdered in the process but clarifies that Veerashaiva literature itself is silent about the issue. Historian Suryanath Kamath claims King Chikka Devaraja was a Srivaishnava (follower of Sri Vaishnavism, a sect of Vaishnavism) but was not anti-Veerashaiva. Historian Aiyangar concurs that some of the kings including the celebrated Narasaraja I and Chikka Devaraja were Vaishnavas, but suggests this may not have been the case with all Wodeyar rulers. The rise of the modern-day Mysore city as a centre of south Indian culture has been traced from the period of their sovereignty. Raja Wodeyar I initiated the celebration of the Dasara festival in Mysore, a proud tradition of the erstwhile Vijayanagara royal family.

Jainism, though in decline during the late medieval period, also enjoyed the patronage of the Mysore kings, who made munificent endowments to the Jain monastic order at the town of Shravanabelagola. Records indicate that some Wodeyar kings not only presided over the &quot;Mahamastakabhisheka&quot; ceremony, an important Jain religious event at Shravanabelagola, but also personally offered prayers (&quot;puja&quot;) during the years 1659, 1677, 1800, 1825, 1910, 1925, 1940, and 1953.

The contact between South India and Islam goes back to the 7th century when trade between Hindu kingdoms and Islamic caliphates thrived. These Muslim traders settled on the Malabar Coast with the permission and blessings of the Hindu Lords of those parts and married local Hindu women, and their descendants came to be known as &quot;Mappillas&quot;. By the 14th century, Muslims had become a significant minority in the south, though the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth. Hyder Ali, though a devout Muslim, did not allow his faith to interfere with the administration of the predominantly Hindu kingdom ruled by Hindu kings. Historians are, however, divided on the intentions of Haider Ali&#x27;s son, Tipu Sultan. It has been claimed that Tipu raised Hindus to prominent positions in his administration back in Mysore, made generous grants to Hindu temples and Brahmins, and generally respected other faiths and that any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who rebelled against his authority. However, this has been countered by other historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non-Muslims of Mysore far better than those of the Malabar Coast, Raichur and Kodagu regions. They point out that Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these regions by force.

===Society===

Before the 18th century, the society of the kingdom followed age-old and deeply established norms of social interaction between people. Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread practice of the Hindu caste system and animal sacrifices during the nine-day celebrations (called &quot;Mahanavami&quot;). Later, fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers. Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and the Sultanates continued, the battles between native rulers (including Muslims) and the newly arrived British took centre stage. The spread of English education, the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more open and flexible. The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also affected Mysore.

With the advent of British power, English education gained prominence in addition to traditional education in local languages. These changes were orchestrated by Lord Elphinstone, the governor of the Madras Presidency. His plan became the constitution of the central collegiate institution or University Board in 1841. Accordingly, a high school department of the university was established. For imparting education in the interior regions, schools were raised in principal towns which eventually were elevated to college level, with each college becoming central to many local schools (&quot;zilla&quot; schools). The earliest English-medium schools appeared in 1833 in Mysore and spread across the region. In 1858, the Department of Education was founded in Mysore and by 1881, there were an estimated 2,087 English-medium schools in the state of Mysore. Higher education became available with the formation of Bangalore Central College in Bangalore (1870), Maharaja&#x27;s College (1879), Maharani&#x27;s College (1901) and the Mysore University (1916) in Mysore and the St. Agnes College in Mangalore (1921).

Social reforms aimed at removing practices such as sati and social discrimination based upon untouchability, as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women were encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted permission to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the Kanara uprising of 1837. The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries, notably Hermann Mögling, resulted in the founding of printing presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the &quot;Pampa Bharata&quot; and the &quot;Jaimini Bharata&quot;), a Kannada-language Bible, a bilingual dictionary and a Kannada newspaper called &quot;Kannada Samachara&quot; began in the early 19th century. Aluru Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book &quot;Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava&quot;.

Classical English and Sanskrit drama, and native Yakshagana musical theatre influenced the Kannada stage and produced famous dramatists like Gubbi Veeranna. The public began to enjoy Carnatic music through its broadcast via public address systems set up on the palace grounds. Mysore paintings, which were inspired by the Bengal Renaissance, were created by artists such as Sundarayya, Ala Singarayya, and B. Venkatappa.

===Literature===

The era of the Kingdom of Mysore is considered a golden age in the development of Kannada literature. Not only was the Mysore court adorned by famous Brahmin and Veerashaiva writers and composers, the kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made important contributions. While conventional literature in philosophy and religion remained popular, writings in new genres such as chronicle, biography, history, encyclopaedia, novel, drama, and musical treatise became popular. A native form of folk literature with dramatic representation called Yakshagana gained popularity. A remarkable development of the later period was the influence of English literature and classical Sanskrit literature on Kannada.

Govinda Vaidya, a native of Srirangapatna, wrote &quot;Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya&quot;, a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I. Written in &quot;sangatya&quot; metre (a composition meant to be rendered to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), the book describes the king&#x27;s court, popular music and the types of musical compositions of the age in twenty-six chapters. King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty. To him is ascribed the famous treatise on music called &quot;Geetha Gopala&quot;. Though inspired by Jayadeva&#x27;s Sanskrit work &quot;Geetha Govinda&quot;, it had an originality of its own and was written in &quot;saptapadi&quot; metre. Contemporary poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada-speaking region include the Brahmin poet Lakshmisa and the itinerant Veerashaiva poet Sarvajna. Female poets also played a role in literary developments, with Cheluvambe (the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and Sanchi Honnamma (&quot;Hadibadeya Dharma&quot;, late 17th century) writing notable works.

A polyglot, King Narasaraja II authored fourteen Yakshaganas in various languages, though all are written in Kannada script. Maharaja Krishnaraja III was a prolific writer in Kannada for which he earned the honorific &quot;Abhinava Bhoja&quot; (a comparison to the medieval King Bhoja). Over forty writings are attributed to him, of which the musical treatise &quot;Sri Tatwanidhi&quot; and a poetical romance called &quot;Saugandika Parinaya&quot; written in two versions, a &quot;sangatya&quot; and a drama, are most well known. Under the patronage of the Maharaja, Kannada literature began its slow and gradual change towards modernity. Kempu Narayana&#x27;s &quot;Mudramanjusha&quot; (&quot;The Seal Casket&quot;, 1823) is the earliest work that has touches of modern prose. However, the turning point came with the historically important &quot;Adbhuta Ramayana&quot; (1895) and &quot;Ramaswamedham&quot; (1898) by Muddanna, whom the Kannada scholar Narasimha Murthy considers &quot;a Janus like figure&quot; of modern Kannada literature. Muddanna has deftly handled an ancient epic from an entirely modern viewpoint.

Basavappa Shastry, a native of Mysore and a luminary in the court of Maharaja Krishnaraja III and Maharaja Chamaraja X, is known as the &quot;Grandfather of Kannada theatre&quot; (&quot;Kannada Nataka Pitamaha&quot;). He authored dramas in Kannada and translated William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; to &quot;Shurasena Charite&quot;. His well-known translations from Sanskrit to Kannada are many and include &quot;Kalidasa&quot; and &quot;Abhignyana Shakuntala&quot;.

===Music===

Under Maharaja Krishnaraja III and his successors – Chamaraja X, Krishnaraja IV and the last ruler, Jayachamaraja, the Mysore court came to be the largest and most renowned patron of music. While the Tanjore and Travancore courts also extended great patronage and emphasised preservation of the art, the unique combination of royal patronage of individual musicians, the founding of music schools to kindle public interest and patronage of European music publishers and producers set Mysore apart. Maharaja Krishnaraja III, himself a musician and musicologist of merit, composed several &quot;javalis&quot; (light lyrics) and devotional songs in Kannada under the title &quot;Anubhava pancharatna&quot;. His compositions bear the pen name (&quot;mudra&quot;) &quot;Chamundi&#x27;&quot; or &#x27;&quot;Chamundeshwari&#x27;&quot;, in honour of the Wodeyar family deity.

Under Krishnaraja IV, art received further patronage. A distinct school of music that gave importance to &quot;raga&quot; and &quot;bhava&quot; evolved. The Royal School of Music founded at the palace helped institutionalise teaching of the art. Carnatic compositions were printed and the European staff notation came to be employed by royal musicians. Western music was also encouraged – Margaret Cousins&#x27; piano concerto with the Palace Orchestra marked the celebrations of Beethoven&#x27;s centenary in Bangalore. Maharaja Jayachamaraja, also a renowned composer of Carnatic &quot;kritis&quot; (a musical composition), sponsored a series of recordings of Russian composer Nikolai Medtner and others. The court ensured that Carnatic music also kept up with the times. Gramophone recordings of the palace band were made and sold commercially. Attention was paid to the &quot;technology of the concert&quot;. Lavish sums were spent on acquiring various instruments including the unconventional horn violin, theremin and calliaphone, a mechanical music player.

The Mysore court was home to several renowned experts (&quot;vidwan&quot;) of the time. Veena Sheshanna, a court musician during the rule of Maharaja Chamaraja X, is considered one of the greatest exponents of the veena. His achievements in classical music won Mysore a premier place in the art of instrumental Carnatic music and he was given the honorific &quot;Vainika Shikhamani&quot; by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. Mysore Vasudevacharya was a noted musician and composer in Sanskrit and Telugu from Mysore. He holds the unique distinction of being patronised by four generations of Mysore kings and rulers and for being court musician to three of them. H.L. Muthiah Bhagavatar was another musician-composer who adorned the Mysore court. Considered one of the most important composers of the post-Tyagaraja period, he is credited with about 400 compositions in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil under the pen name &quot;Harikesha&quot;. Among violinists, T. Chowdiah emerged as one of the most accomplished exponents of the time. He is known to have mastered the seven-stringed violin. Chowdiah was appointed court musician by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV in 1939 and received such titles as &quot;Sangeeta Ratna&quot; and &quot;Sangeeta Kalanidhi&quot;. He is credited with compositions in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit under the pen name &quot;Trimakuta&quot;.

==Architecture==

The architectural style of courtly and royal structures in the kingdom underwent profound changes during British rule – a mingling of European traditions with native elements. The Hindu temples in the kingdom were built in typical South Indian Dravidian style – a modest version of the Vijayanagara building idiom. When in power, Tipu Sultan constructed two places namely Lal Mahal Palace (later destroyed after the siege of Serirangpatnam in 1799), the Summer Palace and the famous Masjid e Aala in Srirangapatna, his capital. However, it is the city of Mysore that is best known for its royal palaces, earning it the nickname &quot;City of Palaces&quot;. The city&#x27;s main palace, the Mysore Palace, is also known as the Amba Vilas Palace. The original complex was destroyed by fire and a new palace was commissioned by the Queen-Regent and designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The overall design is a combination of Hindu, Islamic, Indo-Saracenic and Moorish styles, which for the first time in India, used cast iron columns and roof frames. The striking feature of the exterior is the granite columns that support cusped arches on the portico, a tall tower whose finial is a gilded dome with an umbrella (&quot;chattri&quot;) on it, and groups of other domes around it. The interior is richly decorated with marbled walls and a teakwood ceiling on which are sculptures of Hindu deities. The Durbar hall leads to an inner private hall through silver doors. This opulent room has floor panels that are inlaid with semi-precious stones, and a stained glass roof supported centrally by columns and arches. The marriage hall (&quot;Kalyana mantapa&quot;) in the palace complex is noted for its stained glass octagonal dome with peacock motifs.

The Lalitha Mahal Palace was built in 1921 by E. W. Fritchley under the commission of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. The architectural style is called &quot;Renaissance&quot; and exhibits concepts from English manor houses and Italian palazzos. The central dome is believed to be modelled on St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Other important features are the Italian marble staircase, the polished wooden flooring in the banquet and dance halls, and the Belgian cut glass lamps. The Jaganmohan Palace was commissioned in 1861 and was completed in 1910. The three-storeyed building with attractive domes, finials and cupolas was the venue of many a royal celebration. It is now called the Chamarajendra Art Gallery and houses a rich collection of artefacts.

The Mysore University campus, also called &quot;Manasa Gangotri&quot;, is home to several architecturally interesting buildings. Some of them are in European style and were completed in the late 19th century. They include the Jayalakshmi Vilas mansion, the Crawford Hall, the Oriental Research Institute (built between 1887 and 1891) with its Ionic and Corinthian columns, and the district offices (&quot;Athara Kutchery&quot;, 1887). The Athara Kutchery, which initially served as the office of the British commissioner, has an octagonal dome and a finial that adds to its beauty. The Maharaja&#x27;s summer palace, built in 1880, is called the Lokaranjan Mahal and initially served as a school for royalty. The Rajendra Vilas Palace, built in the Indo-British style atop the Chamundi Hill, was commissioned in 1922 and completed in 1938 by Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. Other royal mansions built by the Mysore rulers were the Chittaranjan Mahal in Mysore and the Bangalore Palace in Bangalore, a structure built on the lines of England&#x27;s Windsor Castle. The Central Food Technical Research Institute (Cheluvamba Mansion), built in baroque European renaissance style, was once the residence of princess Cheluvambaamani Avaru, a sister of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. Its extensive pilaster work and mosaic flooring are noteworthy.

Most famous among the many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the Chamundi Hill. The earliest structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian-style gopuram in 1827. The temple has silver-plated doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the Hindu god Ganesha and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are a group of temples, built in various periods. The Prasanna Krishnaswamy Temple (1829), the Lakshmiramana Swamy Temple whose earliest structures date to 1499, the Trinesvara Swamy Temple (late 16th century), the Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purnaiah with a touch of Hoysala style of architecture, the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple (1836) notable for 12 murals of the Wodeyar rulers. Well-known temples outside Mysore city are the yali (&quot;mythical beast&quot;) pillared Venkataramana temple built in the late 17th century at Bangalore fort, and the Ranganatha temple in Srirangapatna.

Tipu Sultan built a wooden colonnaded palace called the Dariya Daulat Palace (&quot;lit&quot;, &quot;garden of the wealth of the sea&quot;) in Srirangapatna in 1784. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, the palace is known for its intricate woodwork consisting of ornamental arches, striped columns floral designs, and paintings. The west wall of the palace is covered with murals depicting Tipu Sultan&#x27;s victory over Colonel Baillie&#x27;s army at Pollilur, near Kanchipuram in 1780. One mural shows Tipu enjoying the fragrance of a bouquet while the battle is in progress. In that painting, the French soldiers&#x27; moustaches distinguish them from the cleanshaven British soldiers. Also in Srirangapatna is the Gumbaz mausoleum, built by Tipu Sultan in 1784. It houses the graves of Tipu and Hyder Ali. The granite base is capped with a dome built of brick and pilasters.

==Science and technology in Mysore==

=== Rocket science &amp; rocket artillery ===

The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rocket artillery were invented by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to range). After Tipu&#x27;s eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.

According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin Jr. in &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (2008): 
The rockets were observed by Lieutenant General Thomas Desaguliers, colonel commandant of the Royal Artillery at Woolwich, who was impressed by reports of their effectiveness, and undertook several unsuccessful experiments to produce his rocket weapons. Several captured Mysorean rockets were sent to England following the annexation of the Mysorean kingdom into British India following the death of Tipu Sultan in the siege of Seringapatam. The British research led to the development of the Congreve rocket, designed by British inventor Sir William Congreve in 1808.
Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, in his Tipu Sultan Shaheed Memorial Lecture in Bangalore (30 November 1991), called Tipu Sultan the innovator of the world&#x27;s first war rocket. Two of these rockets, captured by the British at Srirangapatna, were displayed in the Royal Artillery Museum in London. According to historian Dr Dulari Qureshi Tipu Sultan was a fierce warrior king and was so quick in his movement that it seemed to the enemy that he was fighting on many fronts at the same time.

Tipu Sultan&#x27;s father had expanded on Mysore&#x27;s use of rocketry, making critical innovations in the rockets themselves and the military logistics of their use. He deployed as many as 1,200 specialised troops in his army to operate rocket launchers. These men were skilled in operating the weapons and were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target. The rockets had twin side sharpened blades mounted on them, and when fired &quot;en masse&quot;, spun and wreaked significant damage against a large army. Tipu greatly expanded the use of rockets after Hyder&#x27;s death, deploying as many as 5,000 rocketeers at a time. The rockets deployed by Tipu during the Battle of Pollilur were much more advanced than those the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missiles (up to 2 km range).

British accounts describe the use of the rockets during the third and fourth wars. During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising from the battlements. After Tipu&#x27;s defeat in the Fourth War, the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets. These became influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.

===Tipu&#x27;s Tiger===
Tipu&#x27;s Tigeris an 18th-century automaton or mechanical toy created for Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore (present-day Bengaluru) in India. The carved and painted wood casing represents a tiger mauling a near-life-size European man. Mechanisms inside the tiger and the man&#x27;s body make one hand of the man move, emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunt from the tiger. In addition, a flap on the side of the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small pipe organ with 18 notes.

The automaton makes use of his emblem of the tiger and expresses his hatred of his enemy, the British of the East India Company. The tiger was taken from his summer palace when East India Company troops stormed Tipu&#x27;s capital in 1799. The Governor General, Lord Mornington, sent the tiger to Britain initially intending it to be an exhibit in the Tower of London. First exhibited to the London public in 1808 in East India House, then the offices of the East India Company in London, it was later transferred to the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) in 1880 (accession number 2545(IS)). It now forms part of the permanent exhibit on the &quot;Imperial courts of South India&quot;. From the moment it arrived in London to the present day, Tipu&#x27;s Tiger has been a popular attraction to the public.

<text>SUTA dumping is a name commonly used to describe a practice used by some companies doing business in the United States to circumvent paying unemployment insurance taxes, as mandated by the Unemployment Tax Act of 1939. The acronym SUTA is for &quot;State Unemployment Tax.&quot;

In all 50 states, each employer is given a variable &quot;experience&quot; or &quot;unemployment insurance&quot; rate, depending on various factors, including worker retention. Some businesses retain the same employees for years and have a low rate, but other industries, such as construction, tend to have high turnover and a corresponding higher rate. New businesses are given a new employer rate, which varies per state (California&#x27;s, for example, is 3.4%); they stay on that rate for a few years, when they are considered &quot;experience rated.&quot;

To avoid higher tax rates, some companies get multiple account numbers with a state unemployment insurance agency and shuffle employees around to the account number with the lowest unemployment insurance rate each year. Another common scheme is to buy a business with a lower unemployment insurance rate and to shuffle employees to the other business to pay the lower tax rate.

President George W. Bush signed the SUTA Dumping Prevention Act on August 9, 2004 to curb the practice.

<doc id="938701" wikidata="Q119043476" url="?curid=938701" title="VisualBoyAdvance">
<text>VisualBoyAdvance (commonly abbreviated as VBA) is a free emulator of the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance handheld game consoles as well as of Super Game Boy and Super Game Boy 2. It is still downloadable to this day.

Besides the DirectX version for the Windows platform, there is also one that is based on the free platform independent graphics library SDL. This is available for a variety of operating systems including Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and BeOS. VisualBoyAdvance has also been ported to AmigaOS 4, AROS, GameCube, Wii, webOS, and Zune HD.

== History ==
The VisualBoyAdvance project was started by a developer under the online alias &quot;Forgotten&quot;. When this person left the development of the emulator, the project was handed over to a team named &quot;VBA Team&quot;, led by Forgotten&#x27;s brother. Development on the original VisualBoyAdvance stopped in 2004 with version 1.8.0 beta 3, and a number of forked versions were made by various developers in the years since then, such as VisualBoyAdvance-M.

VBA was a crucial component of Twitch Plays Pokémon, a social experiment in which thousands of button inputs collected from the viewership of the streaming website Twitch were fed into an emulated version of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;. Viewers typed commands into the chat function, which was then fed into the VBA emulator via an IRC bot. They succeeded after 16 days of continuous play, with a peak concurrent viewership of 121,000 and over 1.1 million unique participants.

== VisualBoyAdvance-M ==
VisualBoyAdvance-M, or simply VBA-M, is an improved fork from the inactive VisualBoyAdvance project, adding several features as well as maintaining an up-to-date codebase. After VisualBoyAdvance became inactive in 2004, several forks began to appear such as VBALink, which allowed users to emulate the linking of two Game Boy devices. Eventually, VBA-M was created, which merged several of the forks into one codebase. Thus, the &quot;M&quot; in VBA-M stands for &quot;Merge&quot;. VBA-M is backwards compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color.

VBA-M&#x27;s GBA emulation core was ported into RetroArch/Libretro, without the GB, GBC and SGB cores. as well as a modified version called VBA-Next.

VBA-GX is a port of VBA-M to Nintendo Wii. It enables motion controls for emulated Game Boy Advance games.

== Reception ==
The VisualBoyAdvance became the most popular GBA emulator for the Unix platform and the emulator contributed &quot;greatly&quot; to the late years of GBA game development by providing a suite of development and visual debugging tools for developers who wanted to create games that surpassed even Nintendo&#x27;s own. A port from VBA&#x27;s code was used as the foundation of the Visual Boy Zune, an emulator of the Zune HD.

Wesley Akkerman from the Dutch computer magazine &quot;Computer!Totaal&quot; named the VisualBoyAdvance as one of the best Game Boy emulators alongside the mGBA, owing to its variety of features and customization options. In a review on the tech blog &quot;Techilife&quot;, VisualBoyAdvance has been named the oldest and most reliable Game Boy Advance emulator and has been praised for its ease of use.

== Features ==
VisualBoyAdvance has many features that would require more work to do on the actual GBA. VisualBoyAdvance supports Fullscreen support, can take advantage of cheat codes from Gameshark and Action Replay, and can take screenshots while playing the game. Many players would also like to find the ability to customize graphics for a better performance than what was possible on the GBA.

<doc id="938705" wikidata="Q49005" url="?curid=938705" title="Curtain">
<text>A curtain is a piece of cloth or other material intended to block or obscure light, air drafts, or (in the case of a shower curtain) water. A curtain is also the movable screen or drape in a theatre that separates the stage from the auditorium or that serves as a backdrop/background.

Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building&#x27;s windows to block the passage of light. For instance, at night to aid sleeping, or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside, often for privacy reasons). In this application, they are also known as &quot;draperies&quot;. Curtains hung over a doorway are known as portières. Curtains come in a variety of shapes, materials, sizes, colors, and patterns. They often have their own sections within department stores, while some shops are completely dedicated to selling curtains.

Curtains vary according to cleanability, ultraviolet light deterioration, oil and dust retention, noise absorption, fire resistance, and life span. Curtains may be operated by hand, with cords, by press-button pads or remote-controlled computers. They are held out of the way of the window by means of curtain tie-backs. Measuring curtain sizes needed for each window varies greatly according to the type of curtain needed, window size, and type and weight of curtain.

Curtains are a form of window decor and complete the overall appearance of the interior of the house. Curtains help control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room. The effect of drapery or curtains is best seen in daylight, and with proper indoor light positioning, can look attractive even at night.

==History==

From evidence found in excavation sites at Olynthus, Pompeii and Herculaneum, portieres, a curtain hung over a doorway, appear to have been used as room dividers in classic antiquity. Mosaics from the 2nd to 6th century show curtains suspended from rods spanning arches.

=== England ===
In England, curtains began to replace wooden shutters towards the end of the 16th century. In medieval England, the earliest form of window treatments were leather panels threaded onto iron rods. These were eventually replaced with woven wool panels. During the reign of Elizabeth I, ornately decorated Italian Renaissance fabrics, including brocades, velvets, and damask, began to be imported. These ornate fabrics, as well as fabrics decorated with crewel embroidery, were used in curtains during the English Elizabethan and Jacobean periods. Solid wood shutters were used during cold seasons.

===Fatimid Caliphate===
In the Fatimid Caliphate, a curtain known as a &quot;sitr&quot; (&quot;veil&quot;) was used to conceal the caliph at the beginning of an audience session (&quot;majlis&quot;). A servant known as the &quot;ṣāḥib al-sitr&quot; (or &quot;muṭawallī al-sitr&quot;) would then pull it back to reveal the caliph seated on his throne. The sahib al-sitr was also combined with the duties of chamberlain, master of ceremonies, and bearer of the caliph&#x27;s sword, and was often chosen from among mamluks from saqaliba backgrounds.

==Light and heat control and insulation==

Curtains are manufactured from a variety of thick fabrics, each with a differing degree of light absorption and heat insulating qualities. For maximum temperature control, the curtain gap to the window should be small, with minimum convection drafts below or above the curtain. Various architectural structures around the curtain can minimize these air drafts, but usually they are just used for decoration and make rooms feel more cozy.

A sheer or net curtain is one that is made from translucent fabric, such as a loosely woven polyester voile, silk or nylon made marquisette or ninon, and cotton lace, etc. Sheer curtains allow a majority of light to be transmitted through the fabric, with the fabric weave providing a basic level of UV protection while retaining maximum visibility outward through the curtain. Sheer curtains are sometimes referred to as &quot;privacy curtains&quot; in reference to their screening abilities; during the day most sheer fabrics will allow people inside the home to see the outside view while preventing people outside the home from seeing directly into the home. Due to the loose weave in sheer fabrics, these types of curtains offer very little in the way of heat insulation.

Uncoated fabrics provide the next level of heat insulation and light absorption. Uncoated fabrics constitute the vast majority of fabrics used in curtains, and are composed of a tightly woven fabric, most typically a cotton/polyester blend, which is mostly when viewed in ambient light. Uncoated fabrics provide a reasonable level of heat insulation due to their tight weaves, but are too thin to completely absorb strong light. As a result, when curtains made from uncoated fabrics are closed in an attempt to block out direct sunlight, light will still be visible through the curtain because its textiles are shiny.

Coated fabrics consist of a standard uncoated fabric with an opaque rubber backing applied to the rear of the fabric to provide improved light absorption. To create a coated fabric, a liquefied rubber polymer is applied in a single coat to an uncoated fabric and subsequently fused dry by means of a heated roller, in much the same way that a laser printer applies toner to a sheet of paper before fusing it dry. A fabric that has been through the coating process once is considered a &quot;1-pass-coated&quot; fabric, anecdotally referred to as &quot;dim-out&quot; or &quot;blackout&quot; because of the fabric&#x27;s ability to absorb approximately 50-70% of a direct light source. To improve the light absorption of a fabric it is possible to re-coat a fabric up to a maximum of &quot;3-pass-coated&quot;, which is considered sufficient to block out 100% of a direct light source, hence such fabrics are referred to as &quot;blackout-coated&quot;.

Maximum light absorption and heat insulation in a curtain is created through a lined curtain, which typically consists of an uncoated fabric at the front to provide the look and feel of the curtain, with a separate coated fabric attached at the rear to provide the insulative qualities. The coated fabric is typically referred to as a lining, which simply refers to a coated fabric that does not have any particular color or pattern.

Curtains may be held back with tie-backs (a loop of cloth, cord, etc., placed around a curtain to hold it open to one side; typically passed through a ring on a hook attached to the wall, and fastened with a knot, button, or velcro; often adorned with tassels) or may be closed and opened with sticks called draw-pulls (rods made of plastic, wood, or metal that can be twisted and/or pulled) or curtain rods which are attached either to the runner or to the first hook. A curtain hook stopper is a device used to stop the curtain from falling off the end of the curtain rail. 

Although some curtains may employ pulley systems, they should not be confused with roller blinds or roller shades. They may be generally referred to as window treatments, which are cover or modification of the window, often with the aim to enhance the aesthetics of the window and the room.

==Styles==
Curtains can be used to give a room a focal point. There are at least twenty different styles of curtains and draperies which can be used in window treatment.

*&quot;Flat panel&quot; curtains are simple and versatile: to make them, pieces of fabric are hemmed on all four edges and the final rectangular or square piece is hung from curtains poles with clip-on rings or something similar. If pleated, the look is strongly influenced by the fullness of the pleats.
*&quot;Panel Pair Curtains&quot; are also known as double panel curtains. They refer to two curtain panels hanging on either side of the window. This is the most common style.
*&quot;Tab top&quot; curtains are made with narrow straps, that loop or tie at the top edge and hung from the curtain pole. This curtain style is often designed as two stationary panels at the sides of a window.
*&quot;Grommet curtains&quot; are hung by threading the curtain pole through a hole in the top of the fabric. This could be either a cut-out hole with the edges finished by a row of stitching or it could use a grommet to prevent fraying.
*&quot;Sash curtains&quot; are used to cover the lower sash of the windows.
*&quot;Rod pocket&quot; curtains have a channel sewn into the top of the fabric. A curtain rod is passed through the channel to hang.
*&quot;Thermal&quot; or &quot;blackout curtains&quot; use very tightly woven fabric, usually in multiple layers. They not only block out the light, but can also serve as an acoustic or thermal dampener.
*&quot;Animal Skin Curtains&quot; are sewn together from the skins of animals. Some are made from a single large animal, or the scraps of many small. Although not used in modern times, they were prominent in the Middle Ages, with many significant royal figures known to have animal skin curtains made from rare specimens.
*&quot;Curtain liners&quot; are used to protect actual curtains from getting wet.
*&quot;Eyelet Curtains&quot; are attached to a pole (usually metal). A number of circular holes are cut into near the top of the curtain and edged with a metal ring (eyelet). The pole is then threaded through these holes, with approx. 4cm of fabric showing above the pole.
*&quot;Pencil Pleat Curtains&quot; are formed by pulling cords attached to &quot;rufflette tape&quot; to gather the fabric into pleats that look like a row of pencils. These curtains are then hung under a pole or attached to a curtain track with plastic hooks fitted in every 4th &quot;pocket&quot; along the rufflette heading. Typically a 1.5 m width of fabric will be gathered to 750 mm width. Rufflette Tape was originally developed from tape which held ammunition (bullets) for semi automatic machine guns.
*&quot;Pinch Pleat Curtains&quot; are usually formed by machine stitching together either 2 or 3 pleats, then leaving a gap of typically 10cm before repeating the pleating process. These curtains are then hung under a curtain pole using either metal pinch pleat hooks or vertical sliding plastic hooks sewn into the reverse of the pleats.

<doc id="938708" wikidata="Q778379" url="?curid=938708" title="Expression (computer science)">
<text>In computer science, an expression is a syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to determine its value. It is a combination of one or more constants, variables, functions, and operators that the programming language interprets (according to its particular rules of precedence and of association) and computes to produce (&quot;to return&quot;, in a stateful environment) another value. This process, for mathematical expressions, is called &quot;evaluation&quot;.
In simple settings, the resulting value is usually one of various primitive types, such as string, boolean, or numerical (such as integer, floating-point, or complex).

Expressions are often contrasted with statements—syntactic entities that have no value (an instruction).

==Examples==

codice_1 is both an arithmetic and programming expression, which evaluates to codice_2. A variable is an expression because it denotes a value in memory, so codice_3 is also an expression. An example of a relational expression is codice_4, which evaluates to codice_5.

==Void as a result type==

In C and most C-derived languages, a call to a function with a void return type is a valid expression, of type void.
Values of type void cannot be used, so the value of such an expression is always thrown away.

==Side effects and elimination==

In many programming languages, a function, and hence an expression containing a function, may have side effects. An expression with side effects does not normally have the property of referential transparency. In many languages (e.g. C++), expressions may be ended with a semicolon (codice_6) to turn the expression into an expression statement. This asks the implementation to evaluate the expression for its side-effects only and to disregard the result of the expression (e.g. ) unless it is a part of an expression statement that induces side-effects (e.g. or ).

===Caveats===

The formal notion of a side effect is a change to the abstract state of the running program.

Another class of side effects are changes to the concrete state of the computational system, such as loading data into cache memories. Languages that are often described as &quot;side effect–free&quot; will generally still have concrete side effects that can be exploited, for example, in side-channel attacks.

Furthermore, the elapsed time evaluating an expression (even one with no other apparent side effects), is sometimes essential to the correct operation of a system, as behaviour in time is easily visible from outside the evaluation environment by other parts of the system with which it interacts, and might even be regarded as the &quot;primary&quot; effect such as when performing benchmark testing.

It depends on the particular programming language specification whether an expression with no abstract side effects can legally be eliminated from the execution path by the processing environment in which the expression is evaluated.

<doc id="938712" wikidata="Q214513" url="?curid=938712" title="Mark Hughes">
<text>Leslie Mark Hughes (born 1 November 1963) is a Welsh football coach and former player who is the head coach of club Carlisle United.

During his playing career he usually operated as a forward or midfielder. He had two spells at Manchester United, and also played for Barcelona and Bayern Munich, as well as the English clubs Chelsea, Southampton, Everton and finally Blackburn Rovers. He made 72 appearances for Wales scoring 16 goals. He won a host of winners&#x27; medals during his playing career, including two Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and two UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cups. He also collected an FA Cup runners-up medal and a League Cup runners-up medal. Hughes was the first player to win the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award twice, in 1989 and 1991, as well as having been the only person to have scored in the FA Community Shield, League Cup final, and FA Cup final in the same season (1993–94). He retired from playing in 2002.

Hughes was appointed manager of Wales in 1999 and remained in the role until 2004. He failed to qualify for a World Cup or European Championship during his five years in charge, although his reign coincided with a marked improvement in results. Wales came particularly close to securing 2004 European Championship qualification. Hughes then spent four years in charge of Blackburn, guiding them to sixth place in 2005–06. He took charge of Manchester City in June 2008 for a year and a half before spending the 2010–11 season at Fulham. He joined Queens Park Rangers in January 2012, helping them retain their Premier League status in 2011–12. Despite some high-profile signings in the summer of 2012, QPR began the 2012–13 season in very poor form, and Hughes was dismissed on 23 November 2012.

Hughes was appointed manager of Stoke City on 30 May 2013. He guided the club to three consecutive ninth-place Premier League finishes in 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16. Progress at Stoke stalled in the 2016–17 season, with the club finishing 13th in the table. Following a poor start to the 2017–18 season, with the club in the relegation zone heading into the new year, he was dismissed by Stoke on 6 January 2018, hours after an FA Cup third round exit to League Two side Coventry City. He was appointed manager of Southampton on 14 March 2018, signing a contract until the end of the season, with Southampton one point above his former club Stoke in 17th place at the time of his appointment. He guided the club to safety at the end of the 2017–18 season, but was dismissed in December 2018 with the club at 18th in the table.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
Born in Ruabon, Wrexham, Hughes joined Manchester United after leaving school in the summer of 1980, having been spotted by the team&#x27;s North Wales talent scout Hugh Roberts. However, he did not make his first team debut for three years – scoring in a 1–1 draw away to Oxford United in the League Cup, in the 1983–84 season.

When Hughes made his United debut, the club&#x27;s forward partnership consisted of 27-year-old Irishman Frank Stapleton and 18-year-old Norman Whiteside from Northern Ireland, and breaking up that partnership would not be an easy challenge for Hughes. But Hughes quickly broke into the first team, partnering Frank Stapleton in attack while Norman Whiteside was switched to midfield to partner Ray Wilkins and stand in for the injury prone Remi Moses. The departure of Wilkins to Milan at the end of the season saw manager Ron Atkinson decide to stick to using Whiteside in the centre of midfield, enabling Hughes to keep his place in the first team ahead of new signing Alan Brazil, and he was rewarded handsomely as he scored 25 goals in 55 matches across all competitions as United achieved an FA Cup final victory over Everton. They also finished fourth in the league.

Hughes managed a further 18 goals in the 1985–86 season, where they led until February having won their first ten league matches of the season, before a dismal second half of the season saw them slip into fourth place in the final table. That season saw him score 17 goals in the Football League First Division – it would remain the highest goals tally in a league season throughout his career.

===Barcelona===
In the summer of 1986, Hughes was sold to Barcelona for £2 million. United announced on 21 March 1986 that Hughes would be heading for Spain at the end of the season, but the transfer had been agreed many weeks earlier.

Manager Terry Venables signed Hughes at the same time that he signed Gary Lineker from Everton to form a new strike partnership at the Camp Nou, but Hughes was a disappointment in his only season at Barcelona, scoring only 5 times in 37 games, whereas Lineker proved a success in three seasons at the club, scoring 51 in 138 games.

====Bayern Munich (loan)====
He was subsequently loaned out to West German club Bayern Munich for the 1987–88 season, where he regained his form. On 11 November 1987, he played two competitive matches in one day, first for Wales against Czechoslovakia in Prague in a Euro 1988 qualifier, and second, after being flown across the border into West Germany, appearing as a substitute for Bayern in their win over Borussia Mönchengladbach in a DFB-Pokal second round replay.

===Return to Manchester United===

In May 1988, Hughes returned to Manchester United, managed by Sir Alex Ferguson, for a then club record fee of £1.8 million. As he had done in his first spell at Old Trafford, Hughes proved to be a dynamic goalscorer and was a key player for the club over the next seven years. Alex Ferguson had been keen on re-signing Hughes for United soon after becoming manager in November 1986, but Hughes would have been liable for taxation on money earned playing overseas if he had returned to England before April 1988.

In 1988–89, his first season back in England, United disappointed in the league and finished 11th after an erratic season. They had gone ten league matches without a win in the autumn but then went on a strong run after the turn of the new year to lift them to third place, only for a late season collapse to drag them down to mid-table. Hughes was voted PFA Player of the Year, the first Manchester United player to be credited with that award, in its 16th season. He was also United&#x27;s joint top scorer that season, along with Brian McClair, on 16 goals.

A year later, Hughes scored twice as United drew 3–3 with Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final, before a Lee Martin goal in the replay gave United their first major trophy in five years. He was United&#x27;s top goalscorer that season, scoring 15 goals in all competitions; 13 of his goals had come in the league, where United finished a disappointing 13th. He scored his third United hat-trick in a September clash against Millwall in the league at Old Trafford, which United won 5–1.

The following season, Hughes scored both goals against former club Barcelona as United lifted the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, winning the final 2–1 in Rotterdam. Once again, he was their top scorer, this time with 21 goals in all competitions, although his tally in the league was bettered by Brian McClair and Steve Bruce. They also reached the Football League Cup final that year, but United suffered a shock 1–0 defeat to a Sheffield Wednesday side managed by Ron Atkinson, who had been Hughes&#x27;s manager in his first spell at Old Trafford. Hughes was also voted PFA Player of the Year again this season. The 1990–91 season also saw Hughes score the last of his four hat-tricks for United, in a League Cup quarter-final replay against Southampton at Old Trafford, which United won 3–2. In 1991–92, Hughes suffered the disappointment of missing out on a league title medal as United were pipped to the title by Leeds United, but had some compensation in the form of a League Cup winner&#x27;s medal. He found the net 11 times in the league and 14 times in all competitions.

For much of the 1991–92 season, United had been linked with a move for the Southampton striker Alan Shearer, but the player chose to stay at the South Coast club until the season&#x27;s end before making a decision about his future, before deciding to sign for Blackburn Rovers. Sir Alex Ferguson remained intent on signing a new striker for United that summer, although it was far from clear whether it was Hughes or his strike-partner Brian McClair who would lose his place in the first team or be switched to another position in order to accommodate a new signing. Ferguson&#x27;s hunt for a new striker ended with the acquisition of Dion Dublin, although Dublin was injured after playing just a few matches for the club, and it was not long before United were in the hunt for another new striker, as a lack of goals were seeing them slip behind in the title race. Eric Cantona was eventually signed at the end of November, which prompted interest from Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan, who had first asked Ferguson about Hughes&#x27;s availability that summer. Ferguson, however, insisted that Hughes was not for sale, and he remained a regular choice in the first team, playing alongside Cantona while McClair was mostly selected in central midfield from then on.

In May 1993, Hughes finally collected an English league title medal as United won the first-ever Premier League title; Hughes was United&#x27;s top scorer with 15 goals in the league and a further goal in the League Cup. From December, he mostly played alongside new signing Eric Cantona in attack, with Brian McClair being switched to the centre of midfield. Hughes collected yet more silverware in 1994 as United won the league title as well as the FA Cup, with Hughes scoring in the final. He also scored Manchester United&#x27;s consolation goal in their 3–1 defeat in the 1994 League Cup Final at the hands of Aston Villa at Wembley in that season. In so doing, he became only the second player (after Norman Whiteside in 1983) to score in the finals of both the domestic cups in the same season. This has since been achieved a third time by Didier Drogba in 2007. His partnership with Cantona in attack also went from strength to strength, as he found the net 22 times in all competitions as Cantona scored a further 25.

In December 1994, with United second to Blackburn in the race for the league title, media reports were linking United with the signature of several highly rated strikers including Andy Cole and Stan Collymore, and there had already been some impressive performances in the first team from 20-year-old striker Paul Scholes. Hughes was now widely tipped to be the player most likely to lose his place to any new signing in the forward positions, and when United completed the £7 million signing of Cole on 10 January 1995, it was almost immediately reported that new Everton manager Joe Royle was tabling a £2.5 million bid for Hughes.

Four days later, however, Hughes suffered a knee injury early in a match against Newcastle, colliding with opposition goalkeeper Pavel Srníček as he scored a goal. The injury was initially feared to be cruciate knee ligament damage, which would inevitably have put him out of action for at least the rest of the season, but it was instead revealed to be a serious gash, and he was back in action within a month, during which time United were left without the services of Eric Cantona, who attacked a Crystal Palace fan and was subsequently banned for eight months. Hughes now found himself with his first team place still looking secure, at least in the short term, and in partnership with Andy Cole. He even signed a new two-year contract.

Hughes came close to winning both the Premier League and FA Cup again in 1995, but a failure to beat West Ham United on the final day of the season and the inability to score an equaliser against Everton in the FA Cup final a week later condemned United to their first trophyless season in six years. The FA Cup final was his last match in a United shirt. Hughes scored eight league goals in 1994–95 (two of them in the 9–0 defeat of Ipswich Town at Old Trafford on 4 March 1995) and managed a total of 12 in all competitions (two in the FA Cup and another two in the European Cup). During two spells at the club, he had found the net a total of 163 times (116 of his goals coming during his second spell). Perhaps the most memorable of those goals came in April 1994, when he scored a spectacular equaliser in the final minute of extra time in the FA Cup semi-final against Oldham Athletic at Wembley.

By the time of his departure from Manchester United, he was the last player at the club to have been there before the appointment of Sir Alex Ferguson as manager in November 1986, albeit having left for Barcelona before Ferguson was hired and then returning two years into his stint as manager.

===Chelsea===
Hughes left Old Trafford for the second and final time in June 1995 when he was sold to Chelsea for £1 million, in a summer that also saw the departures of players such as Paul Ince (to Inter Milan) and Andrei Kanchelskis (to Everton). Hughes scored a consolation goal for Chelsea in the home Premier League fixture against Manchester United in 1995–96; a 4–1 win for United at Stamford Bridge in October. He was on the losing side again as United beat Chelsea 2–1 in the FA Cup semi-final that season, less than two years after he had scored one of United&#x27;s goals in their FA Cup final triumph over Chelsea.

Hughes was one of the key players in Chelsea&#x27;s resurgence as a top club in the late 1990s, forming a potent strike partnership with Gianfranco Zola and helping to freeze out Gianluca Vialli (who became the club&#x27;s player-manager in February 1998). He put in match-winning performances against Liverpool and Wimbledon in the FA Cup in 1997, and Vicenza in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup a year later, playing a big part in Chelsea&#x27;s glory in both of these competitions. In winning the FA Cup, he became the only player in the 20th century to win the trophy four times. He ended his Chelsea career with 39 goals from 123 matches and was transferred to Southampton for £650,000 in July 1998.

===Southampton===
In July 1998, Hughes was signed by Southampton for a fee of £650,000 by manager Dave Jones, as an alternative to injury-plagued David Hirst, who retired within 18 months of Hughes&#x27;s arrival. The goals failed to flow and Hughes was pushed back into midfield, where his experience helped Southampton maintain their Premier League status.

His two goals for Southampton came against Blackburn Rovers, who he was later to join, and a &quot;memorable volley&quot; at home to Newcastle on 15 August 1999. Hughes had disciplinary problems throughout his career, and in his first season at The Dell he received 14 yellow cards, a total which has not been exceeded in the Premier League .

===Everton===
When Glenn Hoddle arrived as Southampton&#x27;s manager in January 2000, Hughes did not fit into his plans and he left for Everton in March 2000. He played 16 times over the course of seven months for Everton, scoring his only goal against Watford.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Hughes left Goodison Park on a free transfer for Blackburn Rovers in October 2000, moving outside the top division for the first time in his playing career in 2000–01. He played a key role in getting Blackburn promoted from Division One in 2001. He also lifted the League Cup with Blackburn in February 2002, before finally hanging up his boots in July 2002 a few months short of his 39th birthday.

Hughes&#x27;s final career goal came in a 2–1 Premier League defeat to Leicester City on 30 March 2002. At the time, he was the second oldest player to score in the Premier League, behind Stuart Pearce.

==International career==
Hughes scored just 17 minutes into his Wales debut, scoring the winning goal against England on 2 May 1984. He went on to play 72 times for his country, scoring 16 times.

==Managerial career==

===Wales===
Hughes was appointed as head coach of the Wales national team in 1999, while still playing elite club football for a few more seasons. Initially appointed on a temporary basis alongside Neville Southall to replace Bobby Gould, Hughes had soon done enough to earn himself a long-term contract, with Southall eventually leaving the set-up. When he took over, Wales were going through a bad patch but in the five years with Hughes in charge, Wales came close to qualifying for UEFA Euro 2004. In their Euro 2004 qualifying group, Wales ended up second, beating Italy 2–1 in Cardiff in the process, but was denied a place in the final tournament after losing to Russia in the playoffs.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Hughes quit the Welsh national side in September 2004 to take charge of Blackburn in the FA Premier League, the last club he had played for. His key aim was to keep Blackburn clear of relegation, which he succeeded in doing, while also taking the club to an FA Cup semi-final for the first time in over 40 years.

In his second season, he helped Blackburn finish inside the top six of the Premier League and subsequently qualify for the UEFA Cup, beating teams such as Chelsea, Manchester United (twice) and Arsenal en route. After just missing out on the League Cup final, his team sealed their spot in Europe by defeating champions Chelsea 1–0 at home. On 4 May 2006, Hughes and assistant Mark Bowen signed new three-year contracts to remain at Blackburn until the summer of 2009.

Hughes then set about creating a formidable side at Ewood Park. He entered the transfer market, bringing in players such as Benni McCarthy (£2 million), David Bentley (£500,000), Ryan Nelsen (free), Stephen Warnock (£1.5 million), Roque Santa Cruz (£3.5 million), and Christopher Samba (£400,000). Rovers finished tenth in the Premier League in 2006–07, and reached the UEFA Cup round of 32, where they were knocked out by Bayer Leverkusen 3–2 on aggregate. Rovers faced Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final, their third consecutive semi-final since Hughes took charge. The match ended in defeat, 2–1. He won the Premier League Manager of the Month award for October 2007, and eventually led Blackburn to a league finish of seventh in 2007–08, Hughes&#x27;s final season in charge at Ewood Park.

During his spell in charge of Blackburn, Hughes&#x27;s side was accused of being &quot;over-physical&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot; on multiple occasions and the club finished bottom of the Premier League disciplinary table in all four of Hughes&#x27;s seasons in charge.

===Manchester City===
On 2 June 2008, Manchester City sacked manager Sven-Göran Eriksson. Interest was also reported from Chelsea, however, who had recently sacked their manager, Avram Grant. Blackburn confirmed on 2 June that they had agreed to allow Hughes to talk to City. The following day, Blackburn agreed to a then-world record compensation package for Hughes to take over as manager of Manchester City, and he was appointed as head coach on 4 June 2008 on a three-year contract.

Following the appointment, Manchester City&#x27;s executive chairman Garry Cook stated, &quot;The Club intends to invest in new players as well as securing the long term services of key members of the current first team squad. Mark has already identified some of the players and backroom staff that he wants to see here at City, and we will begin the process of recruiting them immediately.&quot; The players who did arrive were Jô, Tal Ben Haim, Vincent Kompany, Shaun Wright-Phillips (returning from Chelsea) and Pablo Zabaleta. Hughes&#x27;s first match in charge resulted in a 4–2 loss to Aston Villa at Villa Park but was followed up with 3–0 wins against West Ham and Sunderland.

On 1 September 2008, Manchester City were taken over by the Abu Dhabi United investment group, who made large amounts of transfer funds available to Hughes, allowing City to break the British transfer record and sign Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million. Hughes was very active in the January 2009 transfer window, signing Wayne Bridge from Chelsea, Craig Bellamy from West Ham and Shay Given from Newcastle, as well as Nigel de Jong from Hamburger SV. City finished tenth in Hughes&#x27;s first season with the club, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. City&#x27;s home form was among the best in the League, but their away form was among the worst.

In the summer of 2009, Hughes added Gareth Barry from Aston Villa, Roque Santa Cruz from Blackburn, and Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Touré from Arsenal to his squad, while Carlos Tevez also joined after his two-year deal with Manchester United expired. In addition, Hughes signed defenders Joleon Lescott from Everton for a reported £22 million, and Sylvinho – a former Arsenal and double Champions League winner with Barcelona – on a free transfer.

Hughes started the 2009–10 Premier League campaign with a 2–0 away win at former club Blackburn, followed by a 1–0 win over another former club, Barcelona, in the Joan Gamper Trophy at a capacity Camp Nou. City then won 1–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Eastlands, followed by Crystal Palace in the League Cup 2–0 and Portsmouth 1–0 to maintain a 100% clean sheet start to the season. City continued in good form, beating Arsenal 4–2 and West Ham 3–1 either side of a 4–3 derby day defeat to Manchester United. City would then, however, go on a run of seven-straight draws.

Manchester City beat Scunthorpe United 5–1 and Arsenal 3–0 in the League Cup to reach their first semi-final since 1981. Hughes then led City to their first victory over his former club Chelsea for five years with a 2–1 victory. That last victory was one of only two wins in 11 successive Premier League matches, and Hughes left City before their League Cup two-legged semi-final against Manchester United; he was sacked on 19 December 2009 and replaced by Roberto Mancini.

===Fulham===
On 29 July 2010, Hughes became the new manager of Fulham, following the departure of Roy Hodgson to Liverpool. Hughes agreed a two-year contract with the London side and was officially unveiled to the media on 3 August 2010, before his first match as manager on 7 August against Werder Bremen. Hughes was joined at Fulham by his backroom team of Eddie Niedzwiecki, Mark Bowen and Kevin Hitchcock. His first league match in charge of the Cottagers came exactly a week later, when they drew 0–0 at Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the Premier League season, followed by a resolute display against Manchester United in a 2–2 draw at Craven Cottage.

Draws followed in four of Fulham&#x27;s next five Premier League matches against Blackpool, Blackburn Rovers, Everton and West Ham, with a solitary 2–1 home win over Wolves. This meant that at that stage – including the seven-draw streak at Manchester City before his dismissal the season before – all but two (86%) of Hughes&#x27;s last fifteen Premiership matches had been drawn. The bizarre run, exclusively made up of draws or 2–1 results, continued with 2–1 defeats to Tottenham Hotspur and West Bromwich Albion in the second half of October 2010. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Hughes led Fulham to an eighth-placed finish in the league and UEFA Europa League qualification through the Fair Play league.

Hughes resigned as manager of Fulham on 2 June 2011, having spent less than 11 months at the club. Following his departure, he said, &quot;As a young, ambitious manager I wish to move on to further my experiences.&quot; Fulham owner Mohamed Al-Fayed hit back at Hughes for questioning the club&#x27;s ambition, calling him a &quot;strange man&quot; and a &quot;flop&quot; and said he rescued him from becoming a forgotten man after being sacked by Manchester City. In September 2013, Hughes said he made a mistake in leaving Fulham when he did.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 10 January 2012, Hughes agreed terms with Queens Park Rangers and signed a two-and-a-half-year contract as their new manager, replacing the recently sacked Neil Warnock. Hughes&#x27;s first match in charge of QPR came on 15 January 2012, a 1–0 defeat away to Newcastle. Hughes&#x27;s first win as QPR manager came on 17 January 2012, a 1–0 victory over Milton Keynes Dons in a FA Cup third round replay at Loftus Road. His first Premier League victory was on 21 January 2012, QPR beating Wigan Athletic 3–1 at home.

In January 2012, Hughes brought in two defenders in Nedum Onuoha and Taye Taiwo and two strikers in Djibril Cissé and Bobby Zamora. Cissé made an immediate impact scoring on his debut against Aston Villa. Defeats against Wolves, Blackburn and Fulham, however, prevented QPR from pulling themselves away from relegation trouble. Victories over Liverpool, Arsenal, Stoke City, Swansea City and Tottenham meant that they went into the final match of the season two points ahead of Bolton. They faced Hughes&#x27;s former club Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium, who needed a win to secure the Premier League title. Despite scoring twice through Cissé and Jamie Mackie, two added time goals from Edin Džeko and Sergio Agüero earned City a dramatic victory and championship title. Bolton&#x27;s failure to beat Stoke, however, meant that QPR avoided relegation to the Championship.

In the summer of 2012, QPR brought in a large number of high-profile signings with the intent of establishing themselves as a Premier League club. In came Ryan Nelsen, Andrew Johnson, Robert Green, Samba Diakité, Fabio, Park Ji-sung and Junior Hoilett all before the start of the season. Rangers&#x27; new-look squad, however, got off to an awful start as they crashed to a 5–0 home defeat against Swansea on the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League season. Hughes branded his players performance as &quot;embarrassing&quot;. Hughes then signed José Bosingwa, Júlio César and Esteban Granero but saw no improvement in results, going 12 matches without victory. He was sacked as manager on 23 November 2012 after the team suffered a 3–1 home defeat to Southampton six days earlier and replaced by Harry Redknapp.

===Stoke City===

====2013–14====
Hughes was appointed manager of Stoke City on 30 May 2013, signing a three-year contract after taking over from fellow Welshman Tony Pulis. Speaking after being announced as Stoke&#x27;s new manager, Hughes admitted that he had a point to prove following his disappointing spell at QPR. Hughes&#x27;s first task was to release Rory Delap, Mamady Sidibe, Matthew Upson, Dean Whitehead, Carlo Nash and Matty Lund, at the same time giving Jermaine Pennant a new contract. He made his first signing on 28 June 2013 in Dutch international left-back Erik Pieters from PSV for a fee of €3.6 million (£3 million). Hughes&#x27;s first match in charge of Stoke on 17 August 2013 ended in a 1–0 defeat at Liverpool. Hughes&#x27;s first win as Stoke manager came in his next match as Stoke beat Crystal Palace 2–1 at the Britannia Stadium. This was followed up by a 1–0 win away at West Ham. On 2 September 2013, transfer deadline day, Hughes brought in Austrian forward Marko Arnautović from Werder Bremen and Stephen Ireland on loan from Aston Villa. Meanwhile, Michael Kightly, Cameron Jerome and Ryan Shotton all departed the club on long-term loans.

Stoke soon lost their early form, however, and went through September and October without a Premier League win, picking up just two points and scoring only three goals. Stoke improved in November and December, going a run of one defeat in seven matches, including a 3–2 win over Chelsea on 7 December 2013. December ended badly for Stoke and Hughes, however, as they were on the receiving end of a 5–1 defeat at Newcastle in which Stoke were reduced to nine men and Hughes himself was sent off. Stoke went through January 2014 in poor form and managed to pick up just a point and a 1–0 defeat at Sunderland on 29 January, leaving the club just above the relegation zone. The one piece of transfer activity Hughes did was to swap Kenwyne Jones for Peter Odemwingie in a player-exchange deal with Cardiff City. The arrival of Odemwingie enabled Hughes to alter his tactics and formation and it immediately paid off with a 2–1 victory over Manchester United. Stoke&#x27;s form continued to improve and they went through March unbeaten with wins over Arsenal, West Ham, Aston Villa and Hull City. Stoke proceeded to end the season strongly with wins over Newcastle, Fulham and a 2–1 win against West Brom on the final day of the season, which saw Stoke finish in ninth position, their best finish since 1974–75.

====2014–15====
For the 2014–15 season, Hughes signed Sunderland full-back Phil Bardsley, Fulham midfielder Steve Sidwell and Senegalese striker Mame Biram Diouf on free transfers. Also arriving for small fees were Slovakian defender Dionatan Teixeira and Barcelona forward Bojan, while wingers Victor Moses and Oussama Assaidi joined on season-long loans. Departing were Matthew Etherington, Michael Kightly, Cameron Jerome and Ryan Shotton. Stoke had a mixed start to the 2014–15 season, losing 1–0 to Aston Villa on the opening day, drawing 1–1 with ten-men Hull City, yet defeating reigning Premier League champions Manchester City 1–0. Stoke&#x27;s inconsistency continued through the autumn as Stoke managed just three wins beating Newcastle, Swansea and Tottenham. The club then suffered frustrating home defeats against newly promoted Burnley and Leicester City. Stoke found form in December beating Arsenal 3–2, Everton 1–0 and West Brom 2–0.

In January 2015, Hughes began talks with the Stoke board of directors about extending his contract with the club. Hughes&#x27;s only new arrival in January was that of German centre back Philipp Wollscheid from Bayer Leverkusen. Stoke suffered a number in injuries to key players in January and February, most notably to Shawcross and Bojan. In February, Stoke suffered back to back 4–1 defeats against Manchester City and then in the FA Cup against Blackburn. Hughes signed a new contract with Stoke in March 2015 to keep him contracted until the summer of 2019. City then went a run of three wins against Aston Villa, Hull and Everton and then three defeats against West Brom, Crystal Palace and Chelsea. Stoke ended the season strongly with victories over Southampton (2–1), Tottenham (3–0) and Liverpool (6–1), ensuring a second consecutive ninth-place finish.

====2015–16====
Hughes made a number of alterations to his squad in preparation for the 2015–16 campaign. Leaving the club were the long-serving trio of Asmir Begović, Robert Huth and Steven Nzonzi, with Stoke receiving their record transfer fee in the process. With the money available, Hughes broke Stoke&#x27;s transfer record by paying Inter Milan £12 million for Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri. Hughes also brought in Spanish striker Joselu for £5.75 million, Dutch midfielder Ibrahim Afellay, Shay Given, Jakob Haugaard, Glen Johnson and Marco van Ginkel. The club had a poor start to the season, failing to win any of their first six fixtures, losing three of them. Stoke recovered well, however, winning their next three matches against AFC Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Swansea. Stoke&#x27;s improvement continued through November and December with victories against Premier League champions Chelsea, Southampton, Manchester City and Manchester United; the team&#x27;s style of football was praised by the national press. Stoke ended 2015 with a dramatic 4–3 win away at Everton, while they also reached the semi-final of the League Cup after defeating Luton Town, Fulham, Chelsea and Sheffield Wednesday en route.

Stoke started 2016 poorly, falling to West Brom and then Liverpool in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final. The club endured a tough final week of January as they lost 3–0 to both Leicester and Manchester United and were knocked out of the League Cup by Liverpool after losing on penalties, and were also ousted from the FA Cup by Crystal Palace. In the January transfer window, Hughes let Steve Sidwell leave as well as cutting short Marco van Ginkel&#x27;s loan, while he broke the club&#x27;s transfer record he had set in the summer after signing French midfielder Giannelli Imbula from Porto for a fee of £18.3 million. Stoke&#x27;s form improved in February and March as they defeated Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Watford and earned a first Premier League draw at Chelsea. Following a season-ending injury to goalkeeper Jack Butland while on international duty, however, Stoke lost their defensive organisation: They let a 2–0 lead slip against Swansea to draw 2–2 and then went and conceded four goals in three successive matches, against Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City. Hughes&#x27;s team were able to end the season on a positive as they beat West Ham 2–1 on the final day of the season, enough to secure a third-straight ninth-place finish.

====2016–17====
Hughes spent £18 million in July 2016 to bring in Welsh midfielder Joe Allen and Egyptian winger Ramadan Sobhi, while defender Bruno Martins Indi and striker Wilfried Bony both joined on season-long loans on 31 August 2016 from Porto and Manchester City respectively. Departing the club were Joselu, Philipp Wollscheid and long-serving defender Marc Wilson, who left for Bournemouth after criticizing Hughes&#x27;s defensive training on social media. Stoke began the 2016–17 season in poor form, drawing 1–1 away at Middlesbrough, then losing 4–1 to Manchester City, 1–0 to Everton and 4–0 to Tottenham, and 4–1 to Crystal Palace with chairman Peter Coates heavily criticising the team&#x27;s performances. Results improved in October and November and by December Stoke had moved back into a mid-table position. However Stoke picked up just two points over the Christmas period and Hughes came under strong criticism from supporters after his side lost a 2–0 lead against 10-man Leicester City.

In the January transfer window, Hughes brought in long term transfer target Saido Berahino from West Brom. Performances until the end of the season were underwhelming with six wins from 19, with Stoke securing their Premier League status with two matches remaining. A 1–0 win against Southampton on the final day of the season, meant that Stoke ended the campaign in 13th place, their lowest finish under Hughes.

====2017–18====
Stoke made a poor start to the new season. Hughes came under intense scrutiny by supporters throughout the season, particularly after a 5–0 thumping by Chelsea, where Hughes rested several first team regulars to prepare for a home match against Newcastle United; Stoke also lost this game, resulting in calls for him to be sacked. By January, Stoke had won only 5 of 22 games, occupying a place in the relegation zone with 20 points. Stoke&#x27;s run of poor form included a demoralising 3–0 home defeat to West Ham United, where former player Marko Arnautović scored and celebrated in front of the home fans after having been sold in the summer, as well as several heavy defeats to clubs challenging for the top six positions, including a 7–2 away defeat to Manchester City and a 5–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.

After a 2–1 defeat in the FA Cup to League Two side Coventry City on 6 January 2018, Hughes was sacked. Stoke had the worst defensive record in the Premier League at the time of his sacking, having conceded a total of 47 goals, nine more than West Ham who had the second-worst record. This was in spite of several defensive signings being made in the summer of 2017, including the £18 million signing of Kevin Wimmer from Tottenham Hotspur, the £7 million permanent signing of Bruno Martins Indi, and the season-long loan of Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma.

===Southampton===

On 14 March 2018, Hughes succeeded Mauricio Pellegrino as manager of relegation-threatened Premier League club Southampton, signing a short-term contract for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. His first game was a 2–0 win at Wigan Athletic in an FA Cup quarter final. On 25 May 2018, after a season that saw the Saints retain their Premier League status, the club announced that Hughes had signed a new three-year contract. His assistants, Mark Bowen and Eddie Niedzwiecki, also signed long-term contracts with the club.

Despite a number of positive signings in the summer transfer window, Southampton made a poor start to the 2018–19 season and on 2 December 2018, with the club 18th in the table, Hughes was dismissed. He was replaced by former RB Leipzig boss Ralph Hasenhüttl.

===Bradford City===
On 24 February 2022, Hughes was appointed manager of Bradford City on a deal until the summer of 2024. This was the first time he had managed a club outside the Premier League.

Hughes was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for September 2022 after Bradford went unbeaten in four matches.

On 4 October 2023, Hughes was sacked as manager with Bradford sitting 18th in League Two. It was felt by the Bradford City players that Hughes was trying to shoehorn Premier League tactics into the League Two side, and this ultimately contributed to the lack of success in his second season.

=== Carlisle United ===
On 6 February 2025, Hughes was appointed head coach of League Two side Carlisle United. Two days later, he lost his first game in charge, with Carlisle defeated 2–1 at Grimsby Town.

==Personal life==
Throughout his career, Hughes has been known by the nickname &quot;Sparky&quot; which he took from the comic of the same name. Hughes grew up supporting his hometown club, Wrexham. He was awarded an OBE in 2004. Hughes has been married to his wife Jill since the mid-1980s. They have two sons, Alex and Curtis, and a daughter, Xenna, who plays hockey for Wales. Hughes wrote his autobiography in 1990 entitled &quot;Sparky – Barcelona, Bayern and Back&quot;.

<text>The Severan Bridge (also known as Chabinas Bridge or Cendere Bridge or Septimius Severus Bridge; ) is a late Roman bridge located near the ancient city of Arsameia (today &quot;Eskikale&quot;), north east of Adıyaman in southeastern Turkey. It spans the Cendere Çayı (Chabinas Creek), a tributary of Kâhta Creek, on provincial road 02-03 from Kâhta to Sincik in Adıyaman Province. This bridge was described and pictured in 1883 by archeologists Osman Hamdi Bey and Osgan Efendi. It has a photo and description in David George Hogarth&#x27;s Wandering Scholar.

== Description and history ==
The bridge is constructed as a simple, unadorned, single arch on two rocks at the narrowest point of the creek. At clear span, the structure is quite possibly the second largest extant Roman arch bridge. It is long and wide.
The bridge was rebuilt by the Legio XVI &quot;Gallica&quot;, garrisoned in the ancient city of Samosata (today Samsat) to begin a war with Parthia. Commagenean cities built four Corinthian columns on the bridge, in honor of the Roman Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus (193–211), his second wife Julia Domna, and their sons Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta as stated on the inscription in Latin on the bridge. Two columns on the Kâhta side are dedicated to Septimius Severus himself and his wife, and two more on the Sincik side are dedicated to Caracalla and Geta, all in 9–10 m in height. Geta&#x27;s column, however, was removed after his assassination by his brother Caracalla, who damned Geta&#x27;s memory and ordered his name to be removed from all inscriptions.

The Severan Bridge is situated within one of the most important national parks in Turkey, which contains Nemrut Dağı with the famous remains of Commagene civilization on top, declared as World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO. In 1997, the bridge was restored. Vehicular traffic was restricted to 5 tons or less. The bridge is now closed to vehicles, and a new road bridge has been built east of the old bridge.

<text>Military service is service by an individual or group in an army or other militia, air forces, and naval forces, whether as a chosen job (volunteer) or as a result of an involuntary draft (conscription).

Few nations, such as Israel, require a specific amount of military service from every citizen, except for special cases, such as limitation determined by a military physical or religious belief. Most countries that use conscription systems only conscript men; a few countries also conscript women. For example, Norway, Sweden, North Korea, Israel, and Eritrea conscript both men and women. However, only Norway and Sweden have a gender-neutral conscription system, where men and women are conscripted and serve on equal formal terms. Some nations with conscription systems do not enforce them.

Nations which conscript for military service typically also rely on citizens choosing to join the armed forces as a career.

Some nations with armed forces do not conscript their personnel (e.g. most NATO and European Union states). Instead, they promote military careers to attract and select recruits; see military recruitment.

Some, usually smaller, nations have no armed forces at all or rely on an armed domestic security force (e.g. police, coast guard).

==By country==
===Non-mandatory military service===
Compulsory military service has declined considerably since 1970. A 2016 study finds &quot;that the probability of a shorter military service time is positively associated with smaller country populations, smaller lagged army sizes, increases in primary schooling among young males, and having common law legal origins.&quot;

====Albania====
Albania had compulsory military service. Albania&#x27;s armed forces announced an objective to create a professional army by the end of 2010.

====Argentina====
Argentina suspended military conscription in 1995 and replaced it with a voluntary military service, yet those already in service had to finish their time in service.

This came as a result of political and social distrust of the military, dwindling budgets which forced the military to induct fewer conscripts every year, the experience of the 1982 Falklands War which proved the superiority of professional servicemen over conscripts and a series of conscription-related brutality scandals which came to a head with the murder of Private Omar Carrasco at an Army base in 1994, following a brutal disciplinary action.

Military conscription has not been abolished; the Mandatory Military Service Law is still in the books and might be enforced in times of war, crisis or national emergency.

Conscription was known in Argentina as &quot;la colimba&quot;. The word &quot;colimba&quot; is a composite word made from the initial syllables of the verbs &quot;correr&quot; (to run), &quot;limpiar&quot; (to clean) and &quot;barrer&quot; (to sweep), as it was perceived that all a conscript did during service was running, cleaning and sweeping. Conscripts themselves were known and referred to as &quot;colimbas&quot;.

====Australia====

Voluntary service in the Boer War (1899–1902) was initially from a number of the separate colonies before federation in 1901 and later volunteers were deployed as an Australian force. Two conscription referendums were defeated during World War I. Military service during WW1 was voluntary (First Australian Imperial Force) as was service in WW2 (Second Australian Imperial Force). Volunteer militia units (part-time civilian soldiers) were to be used only within the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1942 some militia units were deployed to Papua New Guinea, as it was considered part of Australia at that time, to fight the advancing and later withdrawing Japanese invasion army. Various levels of conscription (National Service) were in force during the 1950s but only for service in Australia during times of conflicts but the (Vietnam War) saw NS deployed to war with over 500 killed in action and thousands wounded in action with about half of the casualties being NS. The Vietnam War was lost on 1 May 1975 over three years after the Australian Defence Force withdrew in late 1971. All forms of conscription were abolished by the Whitlam government in later 1972. Conscription can be reactivated at any time should war break out; first upon mere declaration by the Governor General, followed by final approval 90 days later as a retrospective action by parliament. The defense act of 1903 clearly states this.

====Barbados====
Barbados has no conscription. The country has set the minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the Barbados Defence Force at 18. Younger recruits may be conscripted with parental consent.

====Belgium====
Belgium suspended conscription on 31 December 1992 by amending the 1962 Law on Conscription, which became applicable only to conscripts drafted in 1993 and earlier. In practice this meant that the law no longer applied to those born in 1975 and later. Since 1 March 1995 the Belgian armed forces consist of professional volunteers only.

====Belize====
Belize has set minimum age for voluntary recruitment into the Armed Forces at 18. (According to the Section 16 of the Defense Act of the Defence Ordinance of 1977.) Conscription has never been prescribed in the Defense Act, but is at the Governor General&#x27;s discretion.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
Bosnia and Herzegovina abolished compulsory military service as of 1 January 2006.

====Bulgaria====
Bulgaria abolished compulsory military service. The last conscripts were sent home on 25 November 2007.

Previously there was mandatory military service for male citizens from 18 to 27 years of age. Duration of the service depended on the degree of education. For citizens studying for or holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher the service was six months, and for citizens with no higher education it was nine months.
The duration of service was two years in 1992, and was dropping steadily, until it was finally abolished.

====Canada====

Compulsory service in a sedentary militia was practiced in Canada as early as 1669. In peacetime, compulsory service was typically limited to attending an annual muster, although they were mobilized for longer periods during war. Compulsory service in the sedentary militia continued until the late 19th century when Canada&#x27;s sedentary Reserve Militia system fell into disuse. The legislative provision that formally made every male inhabitant of military age a member of the Reserve Militia was removed in 1904, replaced with provisions that made them theoretically &quot;liable to serve in the militia&quot;. 

Conscription into a full-time military service had only been instituted twice by the government of Canada, during both world wars. Conscription into the Canadian Expeditionary Force was practiced in the last year of the First World War in 1918. During the Second World War, conscription for home defence was introduced in 1940 and for overseas service in 1944. Conscription has not been practiced in Canada since the end of the Second World War in 1945.

====Chile====
All Chilean men between 17 and 24 years are eligible for military service. Since 2005, military service is voluntary and then mandatory if quotas necessary for the armed forces are not completed. The General Directorate of National Mobilization (In Spanish: Dirección General de Movilización Nacional, or DGMN) is responsible for the recruitment of volunteers and conscripts. Since 1992, according to the Law 19.992, due to the creation of the Corporación Nacional de Reparación y Reconciliación, sons and certain other relatives of victims of human rights violations and/or political violence, during Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship, are extempt of the military service draft, that was compulsory at that time. In 2009, with the Law 20.405, more victims were recognised by the Republic of Chile and the exemption of relatives was also amended

==== China ====

At present, military conscription only exists in theory and has done so since the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. Compositional military conscription has never been enforced.

In 1955, the legal basis for conscription in China, the first &quot;Military Service Law&quot; created a system of compulsory military service. Since the late 1970s, the Chinese conscription laws mandate a hybrid system that combines conscripts and volunteers. The Chinese system operates through a process of draft registration or levy system with recruitment quotas. De jure, military service with the PLA is obligatory for all Chinese citizens. In practice, mandatory military service has not been implemented since 1949 as the People&#x27;s Liberation Army has been able to recruit sufficient numbers voluntarily.

====Costa Rica====
Costa Rica abolished its military in 1948. See Military of Costa Rica.

====Czech Republic====
The Czech Republic abolished compulsory military service on 31 December 2004.

==== Ecuador ====
Ecuador&#x27;s Constitutional Tribunal ruled in June 2007 that compulsory military service was unconstitutional. Military service has been voluntary since 2009.

==== Estonia ====
From 2003, unit-based training for conscripts was introduced and conscripts began to be called into service in 2 parts: pre-service and main occupation.

The length of military service is often determined by the manner in which the professional is recruited. Those who entered the service in January and July by pre-conscription generally earn 11 months, those who arrived in October 8 months. The final length of service shall be determined by the post to which the soldier is assigned. A member of the Defense Forces shall be appointed to the position after completing a basic course for a soldier or sailor. The recruitment recruits professionals whose posts require 11 months of military service (drivers, specialists, non-commissioned officers and reserve commanders).

====France====
Modern conscription was invented during the French Revolution, when the Republic wanted a stronger defense and to expand its radical ideas throughout Europe. The 1798 Jourdan Act stated: &quot;Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation&quot;. Thus Napoleon Bonaparte could create afterward the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; with which he set out on the first large intra-European war.

France suspended peacetime military conscription in 1996, while those born before 1979 had to complete their service; since the Algerian War (1954–62), conscripts had not been deployed abroad or in war zones, except those volunteering for such deployments.

====Germany====
On 15 November 2010, the German government voted in favour of suspending universal conscription with the aim of establishing a professional army by 1 July 2011. The last conscripts were drafted on 1 January 2011.

====Hungary====
Hungary abolished mandatory military service by November 2004, after the parliament had modified the constitution, ending a long-standing political dispute. To restore drafting, a two-thirds vote in parliament is needed, which is unlikely in the short term. , the country is developing a professional army, with strong emphasis on &quot;contract soldiers&quot; who voluntarily serve 4+4 years for a wage.

In December 2011, the National Assembly re-established the possibility of mandatory military service for every male citizen - with Hungarian address - between the age of 18 and the age of 40. Even though drafting is still banned in peacetime, the listing of citizens fit for military service starts in January 2012. According to the legislation, the conscripts can only be drafted in &quot;state of emergency&quot; or as defensive measure, the National Assembly can authorise drafting.

====India====
India has never had mandatory military service, either under British rule or since independence in 1947. In WWII the Indian Army became the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in size. It has since maintained the world&#x27;s second largest army after China and the world&#x27;s largest all-volunteer army.

====Iraq====
Saddam Hussein&#x27;s large Iraqi army was largely composed of conscripts, except for the elite Republican Guard. About 20,000-35,000 conscripts died during the First Persian Gulf War, also known as Operation Desert Storm. In the intervening years, Iraq&#x27;s military suffered from decay and poor leadership, but there was still compulsory service. Note: One of voluntary program was &quot;Ashbal Saddam&quot; known as &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Cubs&quot; where children were trained to defend Iraq through &quot;toughening&quot; exercises such as firearms training and dismembering live chickens with their teeth. Following the Iraq War where the original military was disbanded, the Iraqi Army was recreated as a volunteer force with training overseen at first by the Coalition Provisional Authority and later by the American presence.

====Ireland====
The whole island of Ireland was exempted from UK First World War conscription in 1916, but in April 1918 new legislation empowered the UK government to extend it to Ireland. Although the government never implemented this legislation, it led to a Conscription Crisis in Ireland and politically pushed the country further to seek its independence from the UK. Since independence in 1922, the Irish Defence Forces have always been fully voluntary, and the state&#x27;s foreign policy includes &quot;military neutrality&quot;.

====Italy====
Italy had mandatory military service, for men only, until 31 December 2004. The right to conscientious objection was legally recognized in 1972 so that a &quot;non-armed military service&quot;, or a community service, could be authorised as an alternative to those who required it.

The Italian Parliament approved the suspension of the mandatory military service in August 2004, with effect starting from 1 January 2005, and the Italian armed forces will now be entirely composed of professional volunteer troops, both male and female, except in case of war or serious international military crisis, when conscription by law can be reactivated.

====Jamaica====
In Jamaica the military service is voluntary from 18 years of age up. Younger recruits may be conscripted with parental consent.

====Japan====
Conscription was enforced during the Japanese Militarism in Second World War. Japan&#x27;s Self Defense Forces have been a volunteer force since their establishment in the 1950s, following the end of the Allied occupation.

====Latvia====
Latvia abolished compulsory military service on 1 January 2007. They reintroduced it in January 2024. 

====Lebanon====

Lebanon previously had mandatory military service of one year for men. On 4 May 2005, a new conscription system was adopted, making for a six-month service, and pledging to end conscription within two years. By 10 February 2007 it did.

====Luxembourg====
Luxembourg has a military ground force (army) composed of career officers and volunteers. Compulsory military service (conscription) existed between 1944 and 1967.

====Mauritius====

Mauritius does not have a standing army but operates a paramilitary service manned by volunteering police officers known as the Special Mobile Force.

====Montenegro====
President of Montenegro Filip Vujanović has, as of 30 August 2006, abolished conscription for the military.

====Netherlands====

The Netherlands established conscription for a territorial militia in 1814, simultaneously establishing a standing army which was to be manned by volunteers only. However, lack of sufficient volunteers caused the two components to be merged in 1819 into a &quot;cadre-militia&quot; army, in which the bulk of troops were conscripts, led by professional officers and NCOs. This system remained in use until the end of the Cold War. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-volunteer force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995 and demobilized in 1996. Formally, the Netherlands has not abolished conscription; that is to say, the laws and systems which provide for the conscription of armed forces personnel remain in place, and Dutch citizens can still, theoretically, be mobilized in the event of a national emergency. From 2017, the obligation has been extended to women as well as men.

====New Zealand====

Conscription of men into the armed forces of New Zealand came into effect in two periods, from 1912 to 1930 and from 1940 until it was abolished in 1972.

====North Macedonia====
North Macedonia abolished compulsory military service as of October 2006.

====Pakistan====
Like India, Pakistan has always maintained a purely volunteer military. However, in the immediate aftermath of independence, and the 1948 war; at a time when the army was just reorganising from a colonial force to a new national army; militias raised for service from, the Frontier, Punjab and Kashmir were often raised from locals tribe; each tribe was given a quota and many of the individuals sent did not &quot;volunteer&quot; in the strictest sense (though many did).

====Panama====
Panama officially abolished the entire military in 1992, and transformed it into National Police.

====Philippines====

Conscription in the Philippines has been implemented at several points in the country&#x27;s history. , no mandatory conscription is in effect in the Philippines and military service is entirely voluntary. It was introduced prior to World War II during the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935 with a term of enlistment of months. Another instance was during the Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, where two Presidential Decrees with terms of conscripting trainees into emergency military service were passed. The first was in 1973, with a period of 12 months. The second was in 1974, with a period of 18 months. However, mandatory military service remains a possibility in the Philippines as Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of the Philippines states:
====Peru====
Peru abolished conscription in 1999.

====Poland====
Poland suspended compulsory military service on 5 December 2008 by the order of the Minister of Defence. Compulsory military service was formally abolished when the Polish parliament amended the conscription law on 9 January 2009; the law came into effect on 11 February 2009.

====Portugal====
Portugal abolished compulsory military service on 19 November 2004. Before that, military service was mandatory for all men. From 2004, all 18-year-old Portuguese citizens are, however, required to participate in a national defence day (&quot;Dia da Defesa Nacional&quot;). This applied solely to Portuguese men until 2010 at which point the duty was extended to women as well. Said citizens may request to have their duties waived under one of three main exemptions:

# Prolonged illness, proven by a medical certificate to that effect;
# Residence abroad - if the citizen in question has resided abroad for a continuous and permanent period exceeding 6 months, he or she may request a waiver.
# The completion of military duties in another country - if the citizen has completed military duties for another country, so long as said country is a signatory of the European Convention on Nationality, he or she may request a waiver.

Such requests are not automatic, and must be made to the Director-General of Resources of National Defence (&quot;Diretor-Geral de Recursos da Defesa Nacional&quot;) at whose discretion a waiver may be granted.

====Romania====
Romania suspended compulsory military service on 23 October 2006. This came about due to a 2003 constitutional amendment which allowed the parliament to make military service optional. The Romanian Parliament voted to abolish conscription in October 2005, with the vote formalising one of many military modernisation and reform programmes that Romania agreed to when it joined NATO.

====Serbia====

Serbia abolished compulsory military service on 1 January 2011. Before that, Serbia had compulsory national service for all men aged between 19 and 35. In practice, men over 27 were seldom called up. Service was usually performed after university studies had been completed. The length of service was 12 months, then reduced to 9 months but was reduced to 6 months in 2006. There was also an alternative for conscientious objectors which lasted 9 months. Serbian nationals living outside of the country were still expected to complete national service; however, they could defer it if it would have seriously affected their career in the country where they then resided. This could be done by contacting the embassy in the country of residence (if under 27), or done by contacting the army directly (if over 27). Serbia intends to reintroduce conscription in November 2025.

====Slovakia====
Slovakia abolished compulsory military service on 1 January 2006.

====Slovenia====
Slovenia&#x27;s Government of Prime Minister Anton Rop abolished mandatory military service on 9 September 2003.

====South Africa====
South Africa under the apartheid system had two years of compulsory military service for white men, followed by camps at intervals. This was abolished in 1994. See End Conscription Campaign.

====Spain====

Spain abolished compulsory military service in 2001. Military and alternative service was nine months long and in recent years the majority of conscripts chose to perform alternative, rather than military, service. One of the main reasons for its abolition was the &quot;insubordinate movement&quot;.

====Sri Lanka====
Sri Lanka has never had mandatory military service, either under British rule or since independence in 1948. It maintains an all-volunteer military.

=====Sweden=====
Military Service was mandatory in Sweden from 1901 until 1 July 2010, when conscription was officially suspended. In 2010, the abolished male-only conscription was replaced with a gender neutral conscription system which went into force in 2018. Until 2010, all Swedish men aged between 18 and 47 years old were eligible to serve with the armed forces over a period ranging from 80 to 450 days. The right to Conscientious Objection was legally recognised in 1920: An alternative community service for conscientious objectors was easily available instead of military service. The number of those seeking conscientious objector status declined as actual conscript recruitment continued to decline. In the years running up to 2010 roughly 6000 - 8000 people out of an annual cohort of 100,000 - 120,000 potential recruits actually completed military service.

====Tanzania====
Tanzania officially never had conscription since it became independent.

====United Kingdom====

The United Kingdom historically was the only European state with a volunteer army, and remained so through the first half of World War I. As the war dragged on into deadlocked trench warfare, the number of volunteers dried up, which led the government to introduce conscription under the Military Service Act. The Act exempted the whole of Ireland from conscription, and although an amending Act in 1918 empowered the government to extend conscription to Ireland, the extension was never implemented. Conscientious objectors were formally recognised under the Military Service Act, with the possibilities of absolute exemption from military service, exemption conditional upon performing civilian &quot;work of national importance&quot;, or non-combatant service within the Army; some of those who refused the latter alternatives, or engaged in anti-war protests, went to jail. Conscription was ended in 1920.

Military conscription was reintroduced in Britain (Northern Ireland being exempted) in May 1939 in anticipation of World War II. A form of &quot;industrial conscription&quot; was also used to increase output in coal mining (see the &quot;Bevin Boys&quot;) and other dimensions of the war effort. Later in the war both forms of conscription were extended in a limited way to women, such as the Women&#x27;s Land Army to help with agricultural production. Conscientious objectors were treated more leniently than in WWI, but could still go to prison if they refused war-related work. For example, the scientist Kathleen Lonsdale was sentenced to a month in Holloway prison in 1943 for refusing to register for war duties and refusing to pay a resulting fine of two pounds.

Conscription of men into the Armed Forces continued &quot;ad hoc&quot; from 1945 until the National Service Act 1948 established a system from 1 January 1949 of calling up men in Britain reaching the age of 18 for eighteen months full-time service followed by four years reserve service. In 1950, as a result of the Korean War, full-time service was increased to two years, and reserve service reduced to three and a half years. In 1957, phasing-out of the system was announced, the last men being called up in 1960, and the last conscript being discharged in May 1963, after allowance for deferment of service.

====United States====

The United States first introduced conscription during the American Civil War. With insufficient volunteers coming in by 1863, the Lincoln Administration was forced to begin drafting despite widespread complaints that it was unconstitutional and undermined states&#x27; rights (some states had conscripted men up to this point, but not the federal government). In July 1863, New York City erupted in the draft riots over the draft. However, anyone could get out by paying a $300 fee or hiring a substitute. Many conscripts and substitutes were criminals or men with debilitating health problems, and thus largely useless. The Confederate government had begun drafting men in early 1862.

Conscription was next used after the United States entered World War I in 1917. The first peacetime conscription came with the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. When World War II ended, so did the draft. It was quickly reinstated with the Korean War and retained for the next 20 years, especially in the Vietnam War. Active conscription (&quot;the draft&quot;) ended in 1973.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, brought back draft registration. All males up to the age of 26 are required to register with the Selective Service System, whose mission is &quot;to provide manpower to the armed forces in an emergency&quot; including a &quot;Health Care Personnel Delivery System&quot; and &quot;to run an Alternative Service Program for men classified as conscientious objectors during a draft.&quot; No one has been prosecuted for violating the conscription law in the USA since 1986, but registration is required for certain benefits such as federal college aid, or in certain states, state college aid, or obtaining a driver&#x27;s license. Women do not currently register for Selective Service in the United States; however they may still enlist for voluntary service. United States federal law also provides for the compulsory conscription of men between the ages of 17 and 45 and certain women for militia service pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code § 246, however the federal governments utility of such militia conscripts is limited by the Constitution to repelling invasions and other service within the territory of the United States.

===Mandatory military service===
====Armenia====
Armenia has compulsory military service for two years for males from 18 to 27 years old.

====Austria====
Austria has mandatory military service for all able bodied male citizens up to 35 years of age. Since 2006, the period of service has been six months. Conscientious objectors can join the civilian service (called Zivildienst) for nine months. A 10-month participation in the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service, the Austrian Social Service, or the Austrian Peace Service is regarded as an equivalent to the civilian service.

Since 1 January 1998, females can join the military service voluntarily. The Austrian conscription referendum, 2013 resulted in the rejection of a proposal that would have ended conscription. Although the referendum was non-binding, both parties in government pledged to honour the results.

====Azerbaijan====
Azerbaijan has mandatory military service for all fit men, who are at least at the age of 18. Military service lasts for eighteen months for those without higher education, and for twelve months for those with higher education.

====Belarus====
Belarus has mandatory military service for all fit men from eighteen to twenty-seven years of age. Military service lasts for eighteen months for those without higher education, and for twelve months for those with higher education.

====Brazil====
Males in Brazil are required to serve 12 months of military service upon their 18th birthday. While &quot;de jure&quot; all males are required to serve, numerous exceptions mean military service is &quot;de facto&quot; limited mostly to volunteers, with an average of between 5 and 10% of those reporting for duty actually being inducted. Most often, the service is performed in military bases as close as possible to the person&#x27;s home. The government does not usually require those planning to attend college or holding a permanent job to serve. There are also several other exceptions, including health reasons, for which one may not have to serve. Recruits accepted at a university may also choose to train under a program similar to the American ROTC, and satisfy their military requirement this way. Direct entrance to one of the military academies will also substitute for this requirement.

====Myanmar====
De jure the Burmese junta requires able-bodied persons aged 18 and over to register with local authorities. In 2011, civil servants, students, those serving prison terms, and those caring for an elderly parent were excluded from the draft, but they could be later called to serve. Totally exempt are members of religious orders, disabled persons, and married or divorced women with children. Those who fail to report for military service could be imprisoned for three years, and face fines. Those who deliberately inflict injury upon themselves to avoid conscription could be imprisoned for up to five years, as well as fined.

However, the conscription has never been activated under the military junta which ruled the country from 1988 to 2010. Myanmar&#x27;s constitution states that male citizens over 18 could be called to serve in military, but it has not been activated either. As of 2013, Myanmar citizens are not required to serve in military.
====Croatia====
On 3 October 2007, the government proposed to the parliament of the Republic of Croatia a decision to suspend all compulsory military service. This was supported by President Stjepan Mesić, and after a vote in the parliament on 5 October 2007, the decision became official. As of 1 January 2008, obligatory military (or civil) service is replaced with voluntary military service. Earlier partial and temporary 3 years long suspension of obligatory military service was introduced in 1997 in the aftermath of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium when members of Serbs of Croatia community from the region were exempt from conscription, although they were permitted to volunteer. On the 1st of January 2025, conscription was reintroduced.

====Cyprus====

Cyprus has compulsory military service for all Greek Cypriot men between the ages of seventeen and fifty. Additionally, from 2008 onwards, all men belonging to the religious groups of Armenians, Latins and Maronites, are no longer exempt, and also serve military service. Before 2016 military service lasted for twenty-four months. After that, former-soldiers are considered reservists and participate in military exercises and training for a few days every year. Conscientious objectors can either do thirty-three months&#x27; unarmed service in the army or thirty-eight months&#x27; community work In 2016, however, the Cypriot parliament had voted to reduce its mandatory service to 14 months and make up for lost manpower by hiring professional soldiers.

====Denmark====

As described in the Constitution of Denmark, § 81, Denmark has mandatory service for all able men. Normal service is four months, and is normally served by men in the age of eighteen to twenty-seven. Some special services will take longer. Danish men will typically receive a letter around the time of their 18th birthday, asking when their current education (if any) ends, and some time later, depending on when, they will receive a notice on when to attend to the draft office to be tested physically and psychologically. However, some may be deemed unfit for service and not be required to show up.

Even if a person is deemed fit, or partially fit for service, he may avoid having to serve if he draws a high enough number randomly. Persons who are deemed partly fit for service will however be placed lower than those who are deemed fit for service, and therefore have a very low chance of being drafted. Men deemed fit can be called upon for service until their 50th birthday in case of national crisis, regardless of whether normal conscription has been served. This right is very rarely exercised by Danish authorities.

Conscientious objectors can choose to instead serve six months in a non-military position, for example in Beredskabsstyrelsen (dealing with non-military disasters like fires, flood, pollution, etc.) or foreign aid work in a third world country.

====Egypt====

Egypt has a mandatory military service program for males between the ages of eighteen and thirty. Conscription is regularly postponed for students until the end of their studies, as long as they apply before they turn twenty-eight years of age. By the age of thirty, a male is considered unfit to join the army and pays a fine. Males with no brothers, or those supporting parents are exempted from the service. Former President Sadat added that any Egyptian who has dual nationality is exempted from military service and this is still in effect. Males serve for a period ranging from fourteen months to thirty-six months, depending on their education; high school drop-outs serve for thirty-six months. College graduates serve for lesser periods of time, depending on their education; college graduates with special skills are still conscripted yet at a different rank and at a different pay scale with the option of remaining with the service as a career. Some Egyptians evade conscription and travel overseas until they reach the age of thirty, at which point they are tried, pay a $580 fine (), and are dishonorably discharged. Such an offense, legally considered an offense of &quot;bad moral character&quot;, prevents the &quot;unpatriotic&quot; citizen from ever holding public office.
====Finland====
Finland has mandatory military service for men of a minimum duration of five and half months (165 days); depending on the assigned position: those trained as officers or NCOs serve for eleven and half months (347 days), specialist troops serve for eight and half (255 days) or eleven and half months, while rank and file serve for the minimum period. Unarmed service is also possible, and lasts eight and half months (270 days) or eleven and half (347 days). All males are required to participate in the drafting event () in their municipality of domicile in the year that they turn 18. The fitness for service and the actual induction to the service then takes place at the time and place decided individually for each conscript during the drafting event. The induction takes place usually at the age of 19 but the allowed age range is 18–29. The delayed induction is permissible for serious personal reasons, such as studies, but induction cannot be delayed beyond 29. The military strives to accommodate the wishes of the future conscript when determining the time of induction and the duty location, but these are ultimately determined by the needs of service.

Since 1995, women have been able to volunteer for military service. During the first 45 days, women have an option to quit at will. Having served for 45 days, they fall under the same obligation to serve as men except for medical reasons. A pregnancy during service would interrupt the service but not automatically cause a medical discharge.

Belonging in a sexual minority does not result in an exemption. Transgender individuals usually get their service postponed until they have undergone sex reassignment surgery.

Non-military service of twelve months is available for men whose conscience prevents them from serving in the military. Men who refuse to serve at all are sent to prison for six months or half the time of their remaining non-military service at the time of refusal. In theory, male citizens from the demilitarized Åland region are to serve in customs offices or lighthouses, but since this service has not been arranged, they are always exempted in practice. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; service is deferred for three years, if they present a written testimony, not older than two months, from the congregation of their status as baptized and active members of the congregation. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses will be exempted from peacetime duty at the beginning of the age 29. Military service has been mandatory for men throughout the history of independent Finland since 1917. Soldiers and civilian servicemen receive a daily allowance of €5 (days 1 – 165), €8.35 (days 165 – 255), or €11.70 (onward from day 255).

Approximately 20% are trained as NCOs (corporals, sergeants), and 10% are trained as officers-in-reserve (second lieutenant). In wartime, it is expected that the officers-in-reserve fulfill most platoon leader and company commander positions. At the beginning of the service, all men go through same basic training of eight weeks. After this eight-week period it is decided who will be trained as NCOs or officers.

Having completed the initial part of the service as a conscript, the soldier is placed in the reserve. Reservists may be called for mandatory refresher exercises. Rank and file serve a maximum of 40 days, specialists 75 days and officers and NCOs 100 days. Per refresher course day, the reservists receive a taxable salary of about fifty euros. The salary depends slightly on the military rank: officers receive €56, NCOs €53 and rank-and file €51 per day. The service is mandatory; it is not possible to refuse an order to attend the refresher exercise, only to apply for a postponement of the service if personal or employer&#x27;s urgent and non-avoidable needs require this. The postponement is not always granted. If the reservist experiences a crisis of conscience that prevents him or her from further execution of military service, the reservist can apply for civilian service. The civilian service for reservists takes a form of a five-day course at Lapinjärvi Civilian Service Institution. After the course, the reservist is permanently freed of military service during peace and war.

There are no general exemptions for the conscription. The law requires employers, landlords etc. to continue any pre-existing contracts after the service. For medical reasons, exemption or postponing is given by the military authority after an examination by a military or military-appointed doctor. If the disability is expected to be cured, the exemption is temporary, and the service is postponed. If the disability continues until the male turns 25, he is exempted. The basic doctrine is that the great majority of each age cohort serve, and the size of the active army can be adjusted by changing the maximum age of reservists to be called up, instead of using selective service.

The option to military service is civilian service (available to females after completing 45 days of military service), where an individual subject to conscript finds a job at some public institution, where they serve for 11 and half months, the same as the longest rank-and-file service (drivers). Before 2008, the law required 13 months, which was criticized for being punitive internationally by the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, The European Committee of Social Rights, The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe and Amnesty International.

The national security policy of Finland is based on a credible independent defence of all Finnish territory. The maximum number of military personnel abroad is limited to 2,000 (out of the 900,000 available reserve). Contributions to the UN troops comprise only professional soldiers and trained, paid reservists who have specifically applied to such operations. Therefore, no &quot;expeditionary wars&quot; argument can be made against conscription.

Draft dodging is nearly non-existent, as failure to show up to a drafting event immediately leads to an arrest warrant, and the delinquent is brought by the police to either to the drafting event (if still in progress) or to the regional military office for a physical examination and subsequent determination of induction time. Disobeying the induction order also causes the arrest warrant to be issued and is prosecuted as absence without leave, or after five days of absence, as desertion. Proof of military or civil service is generally required to obtain a 5-year passport (some exceptions can apply). Without proof, the passport is valid, at the longest, until the applicant&#x27;s 28th birthday.

Military rank, either as NCO or reserve officer, is highly valued as a merit in Finland by employers when recruiting a male employee. In general, serving as an NCO or, especially, as a reserve officer, has a clear positive impact on future earnings and achievement of a high career position of the individual.

====Greece====
, mandatory military service at the Hellenic Army was once again raised to 12 months for all males aged 18–45, unless serving in units in Evros or the North Aegean islands where duration was kept at 9 months.

Some are entitled to reduced service due to serious family reasons (single parent families, parent serving in the army etc.). Although Greece is developing a professional army system, the effort has been postponed significantly.
 Women are accepted into the Greek army as salaried professionals, but are not obliged to mandatory conscript service. Conscript soldiers receive full health insurance and a nominal salary of €9 per month for privates and €12 for the rank of draft corporal and draft sergeant. There is the option of serving as a non-regular officer designate. In that case the received salary is €569 (with an additional €150 if the cadet is sent far from his home) after basic training is over. The duration of cadet training is roughly 4 months and 9 more months are dedicated for the actual service. Adding the 1 month spent in rookie training, a cadet&#x27;s conscription will last a total of 14 months. In the last month of his service the cadet takes the rank of second lieutenant. The minimum wage for unskilled workers and professional soldiers stands at around €830 per month in Greece. This results in reservist corporals and sergeants receiving a wage that is 1/70th that of a professional soldier, whom they outrank. This inconsistency was partly dealt with by abolishing the rank of sergeant for conscripts.

=====Conscientious objection to military service in Greece=====
The length of alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors to military service is 15 months. Amnesty International was also concerned that the determination of conscientious objector status fell under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence, which breaches international standards that stipulate that the entire institution of alternative service should have a civilian character. A similar framework was later on developed by the Cyprus National Guard to deal with conscientious objectors.

====Iran====

Iran has mandatory military service for men which starts at the age of 18. Women are exempt from military service. Exceptions are made for those who cannot serve because of physical or mental health problems and disabilities, and students can delay service while enrolled at a university. The duration of military service is normally 24 months, but is reduced to 22 months for service in destitute areas and to 20 months for border regions. All servicemen receive two months of military training as part of their service. The initial rank conscripts receive in the military corresponds with their level of educational attainment.

Since 2008 and the formation of Iran&#x27;s National Elites Foundation (Bonyade Mellie Nokhbegan), students or university graduates who have excelled in their studies or research may be accepted as members of this organization. Members have the option to carry out their military service in the form of a research project lasting no less than 14 months. A 45-day mandatory military training is applicable even for those who are members of Iran&#x27;s National Elites Foundation.

The Iranian Parliament&#x27;s National Security Commission is currently debating a plan to abolish conscription and to introduce an alternative plan that would make the army professional.

Exemptions from the Iranian military service, but also military duty in case of war include:

* Girls and women
* Sole son with a father over 70 years old.
* Men who are the sole carers of a disabled or mentally ill parent, sibling, or 2nd line family member.
* Doctors, firefighters and other emergency workers whose uptake for military duty or service jeopardizes local health and emergency services.
* Workers of vital government institutions that assist or indirectly serve the military (exempt at time of war).
* Workers of businesses that serve the military, e.g. factories that produce military equipment (exempt at time of war).
* Homosexuals and transgender individuals.
* Workers of Iranian shipping lines (IRISL Group) and National Iranian Tanker Company.
Prisoners may be excused of their sentence to serve in the military at a time of war or to complete military service in exchange for a reduced sentence dependent on the nature of the crime committed.

Men reaching 19 years old who are not granted exemption from the military service are not able to apply for a passport, any form of employment, leave the country or collect any completed academic certificate.

====Israel====

Israel drafts both men and women. All Israeli citizens are conscripted at age 18, with the following exceptions:

* Torah students are presently exempted from service should they so choose. This is a contentious issue in Israel.
* Israeli Arabs are exempt from conscription, although they may volunteer. The men of other non-Jewish communities in Israel, notably the Druze and Circassians, are conscripted; women are not though may volunteer.
* Jewish females, who choose to declare they are unable to serve due to religious observance grounds. Many choose to volunteer in the national service Sherut Leumi.
* Women are not inducted if they are married or pregnant.
* Candidates who do not qualify on grounds of mental or physical health.

Typically, men are required to serve for 2 years and 8 months, while women for 2 years. Officers and other soldiers in certain voluntary units such as Nahal and Hesder are required to sign on for additional service. Those studying in a &quot;Mechina&quot; (pre-induction preparatory course) defer service until the conclusion of the program, typically one academic year. An additional program (called &quot;Atuda&#x27;i&quot;) for qualified applicants allows post-secondary academic studies prior to induction.

There is a very limited amount of conscientious objection to conscription into the IDF. More common is refusal by reserve soldiers to serve in the West Bank and Gaza. Some of these conscientious objectors may be assigned to serve elsewhere, or are sentenced to brief prison terms lasting a few months to a year and may subsequently receive dishonourable discharges.

One year after their period of regular army service men are liable for up to 30 days (much less on average) per year of reserve duty (&quot;miluim&quot;) until they are in their early forties. Women in certain positions of responsibility are liable for reserve duty under the same terms as men, but are exempt once they are pregnant or with children.

====Jordan====
, Jordan has reinstated a compulsory year of military service for those that meet the criteria. Unemployed men aged 25 to 29 are the target group of the conscription program.

====Mexico====
, all males reaching eighteen years of age must register for military service (Servicio Militar Nacional, or SMN) for one year, though selection is made by a lottery system using the following color scheme: whoever draws a black ball must serve as an available reserve, that is, he must not follow any activities whatsoever and get his discharge card at the end of the year. The ones who get a white ball serve Saturdays in a Batallón del Servicio Militar Nacional (National Military Service Battalion) composed entirely of one-year SMN conscripts. Those with a community service interest may participate in Literacy Campaigns as teachers or as physical education instructors. Military service is also (voluntarily) open to women. In certain cities, such as Mexico City and Veracruz, there is a third option: a red ball (Mexico City) and a Blue ball (Veracruz), which entails serving a full year as a recruit in a Paratrooper Battalion in the case of Mexico City residents, or an Infantería de Marina unit (Navy Marines) in Veracruz. In other cities which have a Navy HQ (such as Ciudad Madero), it is the Navy which takes charge of the conscripts, instead of the Army.

A &quot;liberated&quot; military ID is a requirement to join the Mexican local, state, and federal police forces, also to apply for some government jobs,
Draft dodging was an uncommon occurrence in Mexico until 2002, since a &quot;liberated&quot; military ID card was needed for a Mexican male to obtain a passport, but since this requirement was dropped by the Mexican government, absenteeism from military service has become more common.

====Morocco====
Morocco eliminated compulsory military service as of 31 August 2006, however, this law has been revised, and at 7 February 2019 officially restored compulsory military service. The service takes as long as 12 months in the new law project with a draft targeting Moroccan males and females alike in the age range of 19–25 with an exception for people with a medical or psychological condition, college students can delay the date of their enlistment thus being able to serve at the end of their university course.

====North Korea====

Conscription occurs in North Korea despite ambiguity concerning its legal status. Men are universally conscripted while women undergo selective conscription. Conscription takes place at age 17 and service ends at 30. Children of the political elites are exempt from conscription, as are people with bad &quot;songbun&quot; (ascribed social status in North Korea). Recruitment is done on the basis of annual targets drawn up by the Central Military Commission of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and implemented locally by schools.

Conscription first began before the Korean War. Initially, under the rule of Kim Il Sung, forced conscription was largely not necessary because the level of voluntary enlistment was high due to financial rewards. Under Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un these rewards have diminished.

====Norway====
Norway has mandatory military service of nineteen months for men and women between the ages of 19 (18 in war time) and 44 (55 in case of officers and NCOs). The actual draft time is six months for the home guard, and twelve months for the regular army, air force and navy. In October 2014, Norway extended compulsory military service to women.

The remaining months are supposed to be served in annual exercises, but very few conscripts do this because of lack of funding for the Norwegian Armed Forces. As a result of this decreased funding and greater reliance on high technology, the Armed Forces are aiming towards drafting only 10,000 conscripts a year. , an average of 27% of conscripts actually complete military service each year. The remainder, for the most part, either are formally dismissed after medical tests or obtain deferral from the service because of studies or stays abroad.

The Norwegian Armed Forces will normally not draft a person who has reached the age of 28. In Norway, certain voluntary specialist training programs and courses entail extended conscription of one to eight years. Pacifists and conscientious objectors can apply for non-military service, which lasts 12 months.

====Russia====
The conscription system was introduced into Imperial Russia by Dmitry Milyutin on 1 January 1874. As of 2008, the Russian Federation has a mandatory 12 months draft. Some examples of how people avoid being drafted are:
* Studying in a university or similar place. All full-time students are free from conscription, but they can be drafted after they graduate (or if they drop out). Graduated students serve one year as privates, but if they have a military education, they have the option to serve two years as officers. 
* Persons who continue full-time postgraduate education.
* Getting a medical certificate that shows that a person is unfit for service.
* Having two or more children.

In Russia, all males are liable for one year of compulsory military service up to the age of 27. In 2006, the Russian government and State Duma gradually reduced the term of service to 18 months from 24 for those who will be conscripted in 2007 and to 12 months from 2008 and dropped some legal excuses for non-conscription from the law (such as non-conscription of rural doctors and teachers, of men who have a child younger than 3 years, etc.) from 1 January 2008. Also full-time students graduated from civil university with military education will be free from conscription from 1 January 2008. Allegedly, the amendment on the length of military service was introduced following the case of Andrey Sychyov.

According to the Russian federal law, the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the Federal Protective Service (FSO), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and civil defence of the Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) are considered as military service.
====Singapore====

After Singapore gained its sovereign independence as an island-city nation, the NS (Amendment) Act was passed on 14 March 1967, under which all able-bodied male citizens of at least 18 years of age were obliged by law to serve 22–24 months of mandatory national service in the Singapore Armed Forces, the Singapore Police Force, or the Singapore Civil Defence Force to defend and protect the country. Upon completion of the mandatory active full-time NS, they will have reservist in-camp training cycles of up to 40 days annually over a 10-years period upon deployment to operationally-ready reservist units.

The majority of conscripts serve in the SAF due to its larger manpower requirement. In practice, all conscripts undergo basic military training before being deployed to the various military units of the SAF, the Police Force (SPF), or Civil Defence (SCDF). During Basic Military Training, conscripts, known as National Servicemen, are assessed on their leadership capabilities (over and above basic military skills). All capable conscripts will undergo further vocational trainings to their trained roles and appointments for them to gain experience to move up the NS ranks.

Initially, conscripts could not pick and choose their desired or preferred vocations due to manpower constraints and quotas. Since 2016, however, this was changed as, when enlisting, individuals can indicate their preferred vocations. Since 2004, Singapore cut its mandatory military service period of 30 months to between 22 and 24 months, depending on medical health and physical fitness. NSmen make up &gt;80% of its military defense system.

====South Korea====

South Korea has mandatory military service of 18 (army, marines), 20 (navy), 21 (air force and civil service), 36 (special civil service) months. There is 3 years alternative for conscientious objectors from 2020 (civil service in prison). In general, with very few exceptions, most South Korean males serve in the military.

Exemptions are granted to Korean male citizens with physical disabilities or whose mental status is unstable or questionable. When a Korean man becomes of legal age, he is required to take a physical check-up to determine whether he is suitable for military service. Any Korean male athlete who has won a medal in the Olympic Games or a gold in the Asian Games is also spared from the obligation.

* Grades 1–3: normal
* Grade 4: special service; given to individuals that fulfill their military duties as a civil worker amongst civilians.
* Grade 5: civil defence during peacetime. 
* Grade 6: exemption from military service in both situation. 
* Grade 7: re-check-up within two years.

There are some controversies portrayed in Korean media concerning special treatment given to celebrities. In 2002 Yoo Seung-jun, a Korean pop singer, became a naturalized American citizen to avoid his military duty in Korea. For this reason, the South Korean government had banned and deported Yoo from the country. Another recent example is MC Mong, a popular singer/rapper accused of avoiding his military service by having his molar teeth removed. On 11 April 2011, MC Mong was sentenced to a suspended jail term of 6 months, probation for one year, and 120 hours of community service.

=====Compensation=====
The following data is from &#x27;Regulation on Public Servant Compensation&#x27;, implemented on 1 January 2020. Exchange rate as of 21 February 2023 (₩1301 to $1.00USD)
====Switzerland====
Military service for Swiss men is obligatory according to the Federal Constitution, and includes 18 or 23 weeks of basic training (depending on troop category) as well as annual 3-week-refresher courses until a number of service days which increases with rank (245 days for privates) is reached. (It is also possible to serve the whole requirement at one piece, meaning no refresher courses are required.) Service for women is voluntary, but identical in all respects. Conscientious objectors can choose 390 days of community service instead of military service. Medical deferments and dismissals from basic training lead to about 60% to 65% of Swiss men completing basic training. In 2013, a proposal was created to replace the mandatory conscription for men, by a voluntary based service. By referendum, the Swiss population refused the project with 73.2% against.

====Taiwan====

The Republic of China has had mandatory military service for all males since 1949. Females from the outlying islands of Fuchien were also required to serve in a civil defense role, although this requirement has been dropped since the lifting of martial law. In October 1999, the mandatory service was shortened from twenty-four months to twenty-two months; from January 2004 it was shortened further to eighteen months, and from 1 January 2006 the duration has decreased to sixteen months. The ROC Defense Ministry had announced that should voluntary enlistment reach sufficient numbers, the compulsory service period for draftees will be shortened to fourteen months in 2007, and further to twelve months in 2009.

ROC nationals with Overseas Chinese status are exempt from service. Draftees may also request alternative service, usually in community service areas, although the required service period would be longer than military service. Qualified draftees with graduate degrees in the sciences or engineering who pass officer candidate exams may also apply to fulfil their obligations in a national defense service option which involves three months of military training, followed by an officer commission in the reserves and four years working in technical jobs in the defense industry or government research institutions.

The Ministry of Interior is responsible for administering the National Conscription Agency.

On 1 August 2008, the Defence Minister announced that from 2014 on, Taiwan would have a purely volunteer professional force. However, males who opt not to volunteer will be subjected to three to four-month military training. Those who do not have a tertiary education will have a three-month training when reaching military age, whereas those who are receiving tertiary education will have to complete the training in summer vacations.

Should this policy remain unchanged, although Taiwan will have a purely volunteer professional force, every male will still be conscripted to receive a three- to four-month military training. Thus, after 2014, compulsory military service will still remain in practice in Taiwan.

However, since 2017, the rapid deterioration of People&#x27;s Republic of China–United States relations has made a concern that the PRC may seek to finalize the current ambiguous &quot;status quo&quot; of Taiwan Strait dating back to the 1940s with its People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). In December 2022, the government of the Republic of China announced an reinstatement of the mandatory 1 year long active duty military service from January 2024.

====Thailand====

The Military Service Act B.E. 2497 (1954) states that all male citizens of Thailand are obliged to serve in the military upon reaching 21 years of age. High school students have the option of enrolling in the three-year Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) during Matthayom 4–6 (i.e., Grade 10–12). ROTC students drill at a local military installation once per week during the school year for a total of 80 hours, with field training exercise at the end of the second year (over the duration 3 days) and third year (over the duration of 5 days). The ROTC program is operated nearly exclusively by the Royal Thai Army, with recent introductions by the Royal Thai Navy and Royal Thai Air Force, but both with more restrictions on entry (e.g. students of schools near a naval or air force base used for training only). Those who complete the three-year program are exempted from conscription and receive the rank of acting sergeant (E-6) upon graduation from high school. Students who do not complete the program or wish to enroll in the commissioned officer phase of the program can do so at their post-secondary institution. Those who do not complete the ROTC program will be required to report for conscription in early-April of the year in which they reach 21 years of age. 
Military service selection is done at a designated date and time at a local school or assembly hall. Each selection station has a quota for recruitment. The process begins with a call for volunteers. Those who volunteer will have the option to choose the branch of service and their date of induction. If the number of volunteers is fewer than the quota for the selection station, the remaining men will be asked to draw a card from an opaque box. The box contains red cards and black cards. Drawing a black card results in exemption from military service. Drawing a red card results in conscription in the branch of service and induction date on the card.

Those who volunteer for military service are free to choose from the three branches of the armed forces (Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, Royal Thai Air Force). Service obligation varies by educational qualification. Those with a high school diploma or the equivalent and those who have one year of military service education are required to serve for two years if they draw the red card, but if these same individuals volunteer, the service obligation is reduced by half, i.e., reduced to only one year. Those with an associate degree (or equivalent) or higher are required to serve for one year if drafted, but the requirement is reduced to only six months if they volunteered. University students can defer their service as long as they maintain the student status until reaching the age of 27 or obtaining a master&#x27;s degree or the equivalent, whichever comes first. Undergraduate and graduate students who decide to volunteer are allowed by their institution to put their studies on suspension until the end of term of service. All conscripts, regardless of educational qualification, undergo the same training and receive the same grade and rank upon completion of basic training: private, seaman, or airman (E-1).

In recent years the government has issued new guidelines for better treatment of transgender recruits.

====Tunisia====

In Tunisia compulsory military service applies to all citizens from 20 to 35. Those who are engaged in higher education or vocational training programs prior to their military drafting are allowed to delay service until they have completed the programs. The duration of the military service is 1 year. And Conscripts Benefit a monthly allowance of 200 dinars for holders of a higher school diploma or have completed at least two years of graduate successfully and holders of a higher technician certificate of vocational training and 100 dinars for other recruits.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, compulsory military service applies to all male citizens from twenty to forty-one years of age (with some exceptions). Those who are engaged in higher education or vocational training programs prior to their military drafting are allowed to delay service until they have completed the programs, or reach a certain age, depending on the program (e.g. 29 years of age for undergraduate degrees). The duration of the basic military service varies. As of July 2013, the reduced durations are as follows: twelve months for privates (previously fifteen months), twelve months for reserve officers (previously sixteen months) and six months for short-term privates, which denotes those who have earned a university degree and have not been enlisted as reserve officers (previously eight months).

Turkish citizens who have lived or worked abroad for at least three years can be exempt from military service in exchange for a certain fee in foreign currencies. In the past, when the General Staff assessed that the military reserve exceeded the required amount, paid military service of one-month&#x27;s basic training was established by law as a stopgap measure, but had only been practiced ten times during the Republican era before being made permanent, the last one being in 1999. This was done in order to generate funds to recover from the aftermath of the 1999 İzmit earthquake, which took place in the highly industrialized Marmara Region of the country, and had a considerable negative impact on the Turkish economy due to the severe damage it caused to a significant number of residential and industrial structures. Additionally, there were paid military service without requiring any training in 2011 and 2014. The measure has been made permanent with a law issued in 2019.

Although women in principle are not obliged to serve in the military, they are allowed to become military officers.

Conscientious objection of military service is illegal in Turkey and punishable with imprisonment by law. Many conscientious objectors flee abroad mainly to neighbouring countries or the European Union (as asylum seekers or guest workers).

==== Ukraine ====
The options are either reserve officer training for two years (offered in universities as a part of a program which means not having to join the army), or one-year regular service. In Ukraine, a person could not be conscripted after he turned 25 years of age. The Ukrainian army had similar problems with &quot;dedovshchina&quot; as the Russian army did until very recently, but in Ukraine the problem is getting less severe compared to Russia, due to cuts in the conscript terms (from 24 to 18 months in the early 2000s and then to 12 months in 2004) and cuts in total conscription numbers (due to the switching of the army into a full-time professional army) since the last conscripts are being drafted at the end of 2013. However, due to the war with Russia, conscription was reinstated and remains in power to this day.
In 2024, military conscription was replaced by “basic military training”

====United Arab Emirates====
The United Arab Emirates started its national service requirement in September 2014. This is the first time the UAE has required mandatory national service. It is compulsory for all male citizens over 18 and under 30 years of age to report for military service. Foreign male residents are not required to serve in the military service. It is optional for females to register for military service, and which they serve for 9 months. Males who hold a high school diploma must complete 11-months of military service, whilst males who have not completed high school must complete three years. All males must register for compulsory military service after graduating high school.

====Vietnam====
Vietnam&#x27;s military service policy change from year to year, but in general there is the commonality that every male citizen aged 17 years or older who meets the health criteria must serve two years for regular military or four years for militia of self-defense. Female citizens are not required to participate in military service, but if volunteered and fully qualified they can still participate. There are special exceptions: such as the citizen brother or brother of fallen heroes, a child of second class war invalids; a sick child of 81% or more; a child of Agent Orange who has a working capacity decrease of 81% or more, a non-military employee, a people&#x27;s policeman and cadres, civil servants, and youth volunteers to be sent to work and work in areas with particularly difficult socio-economic conditions as prescribed by law for 24 months or more.

<text>A participatory organization is an organization which is built based on public participation rather than their contract obligations. 

==Types==
Different types of participatory organizations are possible including production companies, membership organizations (such as trade unions), and co-operatives. They can be legally registered formal organizations or may object to state regulation and be considered an informal organization.

Participatory organizations can have different levels of participation, ranging from complete economic transparency, to participatory management, and ultimately labor management.

==Criticism==
Participatory organizations are negatively affected by the free-rider problem, can be inefficient, and lack clear leadership and strategy.

<text>&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; is an American science fiction television series created by Glen A. Larson that aired on the ABC network from September 17, 1978, to April 29, 1979. It stars an ensemble cast led by Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict and Lorne Greene. Canceled after 24 episodes, the series was revived as &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;, which aired for 10 episodes from January 27 to May 4, 1980.

The series follows a group of humans fleeing the destruction of their homeworlds aboard the titular spacecraft, searching for a new home while being pursued by the Cylons, a fearsome society of robots intent on exterminating all humans.

=== Theatrical releases ===
Between 1978 and 1981, episodes were edited into three feature-length films. The first film, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, was an edited version of the pilot, &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot;, featuring some differences from the original televised episodes, including the death of Baltar. It was released in cinemas in Canada, Australia and continental Europe before its American TV premiere and, in 1979, it was released theatrically in the UK, Ireland and the US. The second film, &quot;Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack&quot;, was a re-edited version of the episodes &quot;The Living Legend&quot; and &quot;Fire in Space&quot;, which also differed from the broadcast versions, omitting several scenes from both episodes. In 1979, it was released theatrically in continental Europe and Japan, and in the UK and Australia in 1980. The third film, &quot;Conquest of the Earth&quot; (also called &quot;Galactica III&quot; on the German poster), was a similar edit, though this time its source episodes were from &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;. It was also released theatrically, in 1981, in Europe and Australia.

=== Television movies ===
Following the cancellation of the series, all of the episodes from the original series were re-edited into television movies for syndication, including a third edit of the pilot. The four two-part episodes (&quot;Lost Planet of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Gun on Ice Planet Zero&quot;, &quot;The Living Legend&quot; and &quot;War of the Gods&quot;) were all combined and expanded with about five minutes of scenes deleted from the original broadcasts. The remaining single episodes were edited into two-hour blocks, combining two episodes into a single narrative, occasionally including over-dubbed dialogue. The final TV movie, an expanded version of &quot;Experiment in Terra&quot; with some scenes from the &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; episode &quot;The Return of Starbuck&quot;, featured new footage of an astronaut finding Commander Adama&#x27;s logbook, which retold the premise of the show. It is believed that this version of the episode was to be released as another theatrical film in other countries, but never materialized.

<text>Jonathan Myrick Daniels (March 20, 1939 – August 20, 1965) was an Episcopal seminarian and civil rights activist. In 1965, he was killed by Tom Coleman, a highway worker and part-time deputy sheriff, in Hayneville, Alabama, while in the act of shielding 17-year-old Ruby Sales from a racist attack. He saved the life of the young Black civil rights activist. They were both working in the nonviolent civil rights movement in Lowndes County to integrate public places and register Black voters after passage of the Voting Rights Act that summer. Daniels&#x27; death generated further support for the civil rights movement.

In 1991, Daniels was designated as a martyr in the Episcopal church, and is recognized annually in its calendar.

== Background ==
Born in Keene, New Hampshire, Jonathan Myrick Daniels was the son of Phillip Brock Daniels, a physician and Congregationalist, and his wife Constance Weaver. Daniels considered a career in the ministry as early as high school and joined the Episcopal Church as a young man. He attended local schools before graduating from the Virginia Military Institute. He began to question his religious faith during his sophomore year, possibly because his father died and his sister Emily suffered an extended illness at the same time. He graduated as valedictorian of his class.

In the fall of 1961, Daniels entered Harvard University to study English literature. In the spring of 1962, during an Easter service at the Church of the Advent in Boston, Daniels felt a renewed conviction that he was being called to serve God. Soon after, he decided to pursue ordination. After a working out of family financial problems, he applied and was accepted to the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, starting his studies in 1963 and expecting to graduate in 1966.

== Civil rights work ==

In March 1965, Daniels answered the call of Martin Luther King Jr., who recruited students and clergy to join the movement in Selma, Alabama, to take part in the march for voting rights from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery. Daniels and several other seminary students left for Alabama on Thursday, intending to stay the weekend. After Daniels and friend Judith Upham missed the bus home, they had second thoughts about their short stay. The two returned to the seminary just long enough to request permission to spend the rest of the semester working in Selma, where they would also study on their own and return at the end of the term to take exams.

In Selma, Daniels stayed with the Wests, a local African-American family. During the next months, Daniels worked to integrate the local Episcopal church by taking groups of young African Americans to the church. The church members were not welcoming. In May, Daniels returned to the seminary to take his semester exams and passed.

Daniels went back to Alabama in July to continue his work. He helped assemble a list of federal, state, and local agencies that could provide assistance for those in need. He also tutored children, helped poor locals apply for aid, and worked to register voters. That summer, on August 2, 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act which provided broad federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote. Before that, blacks had been effectively disenfranchised across the South since the turn of the century.

== Assassination ==
On August 14, 1965, Daniels was one of a group of 29 protesters, including members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), who went to Fort Deposit, Alabama, to picket its whites-only stores. All of the protesters were arrested. They were transported in a garbage truck to a jail in the nearby town of Hayneville. The police released five juvenile protesters the next day. The rest of the group was held for six days in a facility which lacked air conditioning. Authorities refused to accept bail for anyone unless everyone was bailed.

Finally, on August 20, the prisoners were released without transport back to Fort Deposit. After release, the group waited near the courthouse jail while one of their members called for transport. Daniels and three others—a white Catholic priest and two black female activists—walked to buy a cold soft drink at nearby Varner&#x27;s Cash Store, one of the few local places to serve non-whites. But barring the front was Tom L. Coleman, an unpaid special deputy who was holding a shotgun and had a pistol in a holster. Coleman threatened the group and leveled his gun at seventeen-year-old Ruby Sales. Daniels pushed Sales down and caught the full blast of the shotgun and was instantly killed. Father Richard F. Morrisroe grabbed activist Joyce Bailey and ran with her. Coleman shot Morrisroe, severely wounding him in the lower back, and then stopped firing.

Upon learning of Daniels&#x27; murder, Martin Luther King Jr. stated that &quot;one of the most heroic Christian deeds of which I have heard in my entire ministry was performed by Jonathan Daniels.&quot;

A grand jury indicted Coleman for manslaughter. Richmond Flowers Sr., the Attorney General of Alabama, believed the charge should have been murder and intervened in the prosecution, but was thwarted by the trial judge T. Werth Thagard. He refused to wait until Morrisroe had recovered enough to testify and removed Flowers from the case. Coleman claimed self-defense, although Morrisroe and the others were unarmed, and was acquitted of manslaughter charges by an all-white jury. (Disfranchisement had resulted in excluding blacks from jury duty, as only voters were called.) Flowers described the verdict as representing the &quot;democratic process going down the drain of irrationality, bigotry and improper law enforcement.&quot;

Coleman continued working as an engineer for the state highway department. He died at the age of 86 on June 13, 1997, without having faced further prosecution.

== Aftermath ==
The murder of an educated, white seminarian who was defending an unarmed teenage girl shocked members of the Episcopal Church and other whites into facing the violent reality of racial inequality in the South. Other members worked to continue the civil rights movement and work for social justice.

Ruby Sales went on to attend Episcopal Theological School (now Episcopal Divinity School). She worked as a human rights advocate in Washington, DC, and founded an inner-city mission dedicated to Daniels.

<text>Peter Harry Paul Bailey (16 February 1937 – 27 October 2024) was a British novelist and critic, as well as a biographer of Cynthia Payne and Quentin Crisp.

==Background==
Peter Harry Bailey was born in Battersea, south London, on 16 February 1937. He attended Sir Walter St John&#x27;s Grammar School For Boys in Battersea. He won a scholarship to the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1953 and worked as an actor between 1956 and 1964, during which he adopted the name Paul Bailey.

==Career==
Bailey began to pursue writing in between acting jobs, and his first novel, &quot;At the Jerusalem&quot;, was published in 1967. The book, set in an old people&#x27;s home, won a Somerset Maugham Award and an Arts Council Writers&#x27; Award. Later books included &quot;Peter Smart&#x27;s Confessions&quot; (1977) and &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Lament&quot; (1986), both shortlisted for the Booker Prize; and &quot;Sugar Cane&quot; (1993), a sequel to &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Lament&quot;. &quot;Kitty and Virgil&quot; (1998) is the story of the relationship between an Englishwoman and an exiled Romanian poet. In &quot;Uncle Rudolf&quot; (2002), the narrator looks back on his colourful life and his rescue as a young boy from a likely death in fascist Romania, by his uncle, a gifted lyric tenor and the novel&#x27;s eponymous hero. In his book &quot;Chapman&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; (2011), the main character, Harry Chapman, in morphine-induced delirium, encounters characters from literature, writers, deceased friends and family members as he lies seriously ill in a London hospital. Despite his melancholy and fear, Harry entertains the nurses with recitations of some of the favourite poems he has memorised in a lifetime of reading. Bailey&#x27;s last book was &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Boy&quot; (2014), a melancholic gay love story that spans four decades.

He was appointed Literary Fellow at Newcastle and Durham Universities (1972–74), and was awarded a Bicentennial Fellowship in 1976, enabling him to travel to the U.S., where he was Visiting Lecturer in English Literature at the North Dakota State University (1977–79). He was awarded the E. M. Forster Award in 1974 and in 1978 he won the George Orwell Memorial Prize for his essay &quot;The Limitations of Despair&quot;, first published in &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine. Bailey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999.

Bailey also wrote plays for radio and television: &quot;At Cousin Henry&#x27;s&quot; was broadcast in 1964 and his adaptation of J. R. Ackerley&#x27;s &quot;We Think the World of You&quot; was televised in 1980. His non-fiction books include a volume of memoir, entitled &quot;An Immaculate Mistake: Scenes from Childhood and Beyond&quot; (1990), and &quot;Three Queer Lives: An Alternative Biography of Naomi Jacob, Fred Barnes and Arthur Marshall&quot; (2001), a biography of three gay popular entertainers from the twentieth century.

Bailey was also known as a literary critic, and contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and in 2001 headed an all-male &quot;alternative&quot; judging panel for the Orange Prize. In 2003 he joined the staff on Kingston University&#x27;s creative writing course, where he continued to teach as Senior Distinguished Research Fellow until his death. From 2010 to 2019, he wrote theatre criticism for &quot;The Oldie&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Bailey was in a relationship with costume designer David Healy from 1964 until Healy&#x27;s death in 1986. In 1990 he began a relationship with book publisher Jeremy Trevathan, with whom he entered a civil partnership in 2016. Bailey died on 27 October 2024, at the age of 87.

<doc id="938751" wikidata="Q846748" url="?curid=938751" title="Conductus">
<text>The conductus (plural: &quot;conducti&quot;) was a sacred Latin song in the Middle Ages, one whose poetry and music were newly composed. It is non-liturgical since its Latin lyric borrows little from previous chants. The conductus was northern French equivalent of the &quot;versus&quot;, which flourished in Aquitaine. It was originally found in the twelfth-century Aquitanian repertories. But major collections of conducti were preserved in Paris. The conductus typically includes one, two, or three voices. A small number of the conducti are for four voices. Stylistically, the conductus is a type of discant (i.e. note-against-note polyphony). Its form can be strophic or through-composed form. The genre flourished from the early twelfth century to the middle of thirteenth century. It was one of the principal types of vocal composition of the ars antiqua period of medieval music history.

== History ==

=== Origins of the name ===
The conductus was most likely sung while the lectionary was carried from its place of safekeeping to the place from which it was to be read. But the origins of the term &quot;conductus&quot; remain obscure. The noun is derived from the verb &quot;conducere&quot;, which can mean to lead, guide, or escort. Thus according to one hypothesis, the genre was called &quot;conductus&quot; because it served to accompany a procession. For example, according to the record of manuscript in the Institución Colombina, Seville, the conductus &quot;Salve festa dies&quot; was used for the same role of procession as the ancient hymn. The hymn with the same name was sung during the procession to the altar. But &quot;conducere&quot; can also mean &quot;to bring together&quot; or &quot;join together.&quot; Thus according to another hypothesis, the genre was called &quot;conductus&quot; because it brings sequence or hymn together. The conductus is based on a condensed version of a sequence or hymn. For instance, the conductus &quot;Orienti oriens&quot; is derived from the sequence &quot;Noster cetus iste letus&quot;.

=== Development ===
The genre of the conductus most likely originated in the south of France around 1150 and reached its peak development during the activity of the Notre Dame School in the early thirteenth century. The conductus is the northern counterpart of the versus. In some sources, the versus and conductus can be interchangeably used, since both of them are strophic and accentual Latin poems. However, the conductus might be different from Aquitanian versus due to its inclusion of a &quot;caudae&quot; at the end. The melismatic flourish (&quot;caudae&quot;) in the conductus can separate the text out and disrupt the overall structure while Aquitanian melismas keeps the flow going.

Much of the surviving repertoire is contained in the Florence Manuscript and also the manuscript Wolfenbüttel 1099. In early documents, the conductus was often called &quot;Benedicamus trope&quot; or &quot;benedictio.&quot; The early conducti are simple and free from the section of melismatic flourishes known as &quot;caudae&quot;. &quot;Caudae&quot; appear more often in conducti composed after 1200. Most conducti in the large thirteenth-century manuscript collections from Notre Dame are for two or three voices.

=== Authorship ===
Many but not all conducti are anonymous. Some are attributed to some well-known poets and musicians of the time, such as Philip the Chancellor, Walter of Châtillon, Bernard of Clairvaux, Peter of Blois, and Perotinus. For instance, the text of the conductus &quot;Beata viscera&quot; was written by Philip the Chacellor and its music was attributed to Perotinus.

Common subjects of the poems are the lives of the saints, feasts of the Lord, the Nativity, as well as more current subjects such as exemplary behavior of contemporary witnesses to the faith, such as Thomas Becket. Some conducti from later period consist of songs which criticize abuses by the clergy, including some that are quite outraged. Other conducti refer to significant historical events. Philip the Chancellor&#x27;s composition, &quot;Aurelianis civitas&quot; is associated with a student riot of 1200 in a French city, Orléans. In the poem, Philip lamented the conflict and its fatal consequences.

== Musical Characteristics ==

=== Number of Voices ===
The conductus can include either one voice or multiple voices, known as monophonic and polyphonic compositions. The surviving repertories indicates the monophonic conducti are about double sizes of the polyphony type. But it was the polyphonic conductus that become one of principal musical genres in Parisian polyphony. Some melodies form monophonic compositions provide the basis for the multiple-voice writing.

=== Form ===
The composition can be either in strophic or through-composed form. Unlike the motet, the conductus is not &quot;based on pre-existing material.&quot; The composer invented the overall structure. In strophic form, the structure of each stanza is the same. In through-composed form, each stanza does not repeat. The strophic composition is typical in the earlier works. The through-composed composition came after 1200.
=== Style and declamation ===
In the conductus, the voices sang together in a style known as discant. Stylistically, it was different from the other principal liturgical polyphonic style of the time, organum, in which the voices usually moved at different speeds. The text declamation of the conductus can be either syllabic/neumatic or melismatic. The syllabic/neumatic type is coined the term &quot;musica cum littera.&quot; Monophonic pieces are mostly syllabic. The latter is called &quot;musica sine littera.&quot; The melismatic declamation can be applied to the &quot;caudae&quot; or the entire piece. The medieval theorist, Franco de Cologne refers to the conductus as discant. He advocated writing a beautiful melody in the tenor. &quot;Discantus positio vulgaris,&quot; one of the earliest conductus sources, mentions &quot;conducts as a species of discantus.&quot;

=== Rhythm ===
The conductus is non-metrical, which means it is not sung in a strict rhythmic pattern. The German editor, Guido Maria Dreves, who compiled the conductus poem, suggests that each syllable is more likely to be sung in the same value. When the mensural notation later took over the unmeasured notation in the conductus, the conductus rhythm has changed. The Metz fragment shows the recopying of conductus in mensural notation occurred between 1260 and 1300. Thus, the conductus rhythm was later expressed by the rhythmic modes.

== Performance ==
In the documented liturgical use, the conductus was most likely a substitute for the versicle of &quot;Benedicamus domino,&quot; which was performed at the end of Mass or the Office. &quot;The performance of conducti is associated with the introduction of a reading within the liturgy.&quot; It serves as a cue for the following part of the ceremony. For the non-liturgical use, the conductus was sung during &quot;the public readings in the chapter house and monastic refectory.&quot;

Medieval singers improvised the refrains of the conductus. The refrains serve as a visual cueing for the repetition of music and text. By changing the lyrics and rhythmic delivery of the refrains, singers can add improvisatory meaning to the conductus. Other improvisation includes creating new correspondence between music and text or changing the duration of each syllable. The conductus repertory with larger numbers of stanzas require singer&#x27;s improvisatory skill.

== Reception history ==
The conductus flourished from the early twelfth century to the middle of thirteenth century. It was prominent in the thirteenth Parisian polyphony. Around 1300, the conductus became less popular. Early fourteenth century theorist Jacques of Liège, a vigorous defender of the &quot;ars antiqua&quot; style against the new &quot;immoral and lascivious&quot; &quot;ars nova&quot; style, lamented the disinterest of contemporary composers in the conductus. The conductus lasted longest in Germany, where it was documented into the fourteenth century. English conducti of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries often use the technique of rondellus.

== References by medieval authors ==
Johannes de Garlandia () states that &quot;The conductus is to be known that these figures are placed sometimes without text, sometimes with text; , as in caudae or in conducti, as in motets...It is seen in conducti or motets applied without text or with text, if they are properly notated.&quot;

Franco of Cologne () was the first to define conductus as a type of discant: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Both the tenor and the polyphonic superstructure must be invented by the composer.&quot;)

Anonymous IV () gives a few comments on polyphonic conducti in his treatise. Observing from Perotinus&#x27;s conducti, he finds that the conductus contained both monophonic and polyphonic pieces with or without &quot;caudae&quot;. He also highlights that &quot;all voices of conducti are customarily notated on five-line staves rather than on four-line staves as Gregorian chants.&quot;

Lambertus () associates the &quot;caudae&quot; of conducti with melismatic style. He states &quot;&quot; (&quot;sometimes used for such figures and letters, sometimes without. When the letter to the motellis and the like, without a letter to the neumas the entrepreneurs and the like&quot;) 

Walter Odington () describes conductus as &quot;several suitable melodies brought together.&quot; He defines, &quot;Conducti are composed of a number of suitable melodies, known or invented, and in various modes and with phrases repeated at the same pitch [in the same mode] or others….&quot;

Johannes de Grocheio () follows Franco&#x27;s definition and reiterates that the tenor of the conductus is newly invented: &quot;&quot; (&quot;The &quot;cantus corona tubs&quot; is said by some to be a simple conductus.&quot;)

<doc id="938757" wikidata="Q3005563" url="?curid=938757" title="Cruis'n USA">
<text>Cruis&#x27;n USA is a racing video game developed by TV Games Inc. and published by Nintendo. It was first released in arcades in 1994 by Midway Games, with a port to the Nintendo 64 developed by Leland Interactive Media released in 1996. It is the first game in the &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; series and features races set in locations across the Continental United States.

&quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; is branded as the first release of the &quot;Ultra 64&quot; platform collaboration between Midway and Nintendo, although it was based on the Midway V-unit arcade hardware, predating the &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; arcade hardware which would become the Nintendo 64. The home port was published by Nintendo as part of the deal.

The arcade version was critically and commercially successful, drawing favorable comparisons to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. The Nintendo 64 version received poor reviews, but was also commercially successful. It was released on Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in Europe on March 28, 2008, making it the first third party developed Nintendo 64 game to be released on the service. It became available on the Virtual Console in North America on March 31, 2008.

==Gameplay==

Like in most racing games, players race down one-way courses consisting of streets vaguely based on real-life locations. While racing, they do their best to avoid various road hazards such as oncoming traffic and construction. Players chose between seven different cars, with either an automatic or manual transmission. The environments include Golden Gate Park, in San Francisco, to Washington D.C.

In each race, players must reach first place to advance to the next track, and there is a time limit to reach the goal, which can be extended by driving through checkpoints. If the player does not finish before the timer reaches zero, the game ends, unless there is a continue available. Unlike most racing games, there is the option to change the music by pressing the music button.

==Vehicles==
The four vehicles featured in the game are generic vehicles based on their real life counter parts which consists of a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette labeled as a 1963 Muscle Car, a 1991 Ferrari 512 TR labeled as the Italia P69, a 1940 Ford V-8 De Luxe labeled as &quot;La Bomba&quot;, and a Hyundai HCD-II &quot;Epoch&quot; labeled as &quot;Devastator IV&quot;. Bonus cars consist of a 1991 Chevrolet Caprice police car, a school bus, and a Jeep Wrangler labeled as an All Terrain Vehicle.

==Development==

In early 1994, Nintendo signed a licensing agreement with WMS Industries, Midway&#x27;s parent company, which allowed Midway to release two arcade games advertised as the first version of Ultra 64 hardware and formed a joint venture named &quot;Williams/Nintendo&quot; to port those two games to its consoles. Nintendo wanted an arcade racing game to compete against Sega&#x27;s racing game &quot;Daytona USA&quot; and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, both of which were successful at the time. Eugene Jarvis, who had developed &quot;Defender&quot; (1981) and &quot;&quot; (1982) for Williams Electronics, served as lead developer. Jarvis pitched a racing game concept to Williams and Nintendo. Along with &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, created by Rare, the arcade original was showcased at the June 1994 Consumer Electronics Show as running on Ultra 64 branded arcade hardware, sharing the branding of Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming home console, codenamed Ultra 64. A few months later, Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln admitted that &quot;Cruisin&#x27; USA&quot; was actually programmed before the MIPS CPU based console version of Ultra 64 development tools were available from Silicon Graphics, and that even at this point Rare was the only development company to have access to these development tools. The &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; cabinet shown at the Consumer Electronics Show was actually running on a modified JAMMA board. &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; runs on a Midway V-Unit, which is very different from what would become the Silicon Graphics based Nintendo 64. The Midway V-unit consists of a 50 MHz TMS32031 CPU, a 10 MHz ADSP-2115 DSP for sound, and a custom 3D chip that can render perspective-correct but unfiltered quads at a high resolution (512 × 400 pixels).

The San Diego division of Williams Entertainment, Leland Interactive Media, the developers of the Nintendo 64 version, had to downgrade most of the arcade graphics to accommodate home console hardware. Originally announced as a Nintendo 64 launch game along with &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot;, less than a month before launch day it was pulled from the lineup and returned to Williams for retooling because it did not meet Nintendo&#x27;s quality standards. Several elements of the game, such as the ability to run over animals and depictions of Bill and Hillary Clinton on a hot tub, were censored from the Nintendo 64 version. During the last couple of months of development, people sent letters or emails about the censorship. Jarvis also publicly objected to it: &quot;It seems like they don&#x27;t have a sense of humor. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with these people.&quot;

==Reception==
The arcade version of &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; was critically and commercially successful. In the United States, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; to be the second most-popular deluxe arcade game in November 1994, and &quot;Play Meter&quot; listed the title to be the second most-popular arcade game in December 1994. It was one of America&#x27;s top five best-selling arcade video games of 1994, receiving a Diamond Award from the American Amusement Machine Association (AMAA). It went on to be America&#x27;s highest-grossing dedicated arcade cabinet of 1995.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game; while viewing the game as graphically less impressive than its rivals, they praised other aspects that could rival games like &quot;Out Run&quot; from Sega.

The Nintendo 64 version met with mixed reviews, and earned a GameRankings score of 50.63% based on 16 reviews. Reviews widely criticized the jerky frame rate, poor collision detection, and music, which they said to be both stylistically inappropriate and poorly composed. &quot;Next Generation&quot; concluded that &quot;this half-hearted, rough-shod conversion is exactly what Nintendo 64 doesn&#x27;t need&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Gerstmann and &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Air Hendrix had more mixed reactions than most. Gerstmann praised the controls when using the Nintendo 64 controller&#x27;s analog stick, but concluded the game to be a major disappointment. Air Hendrix, while heavily criticizing elements like the pop-up in the two-player mode and lack of variety in general, said it is essentially a faithful conversion of the arcade game and worth trying out as a rental, though not an outright purchase. Peer Schneider of IGN and Kraig Kujawa of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; both said the two-player split-screen mode is the highlight of the game, while noting that the frame rate problems are even worse in this mode. Kujawa&#x27;s co-reviewer Dean Hager said the game &quot;certainly fails to show off the processing power of the N64&quot;, and Shneider said it lacked excitement and was &quot;probably doomed to be the nadir of N64 racing games for many years to come.&quot;

Despite the negative reviews, the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; saw strong sales, thanks largely to a combination of the console&#x27;s popularity and the small library of games available for it at the time. It was the sixth best-selling video game of the 1996 Christmas shopping season according to TRST data, with three of the five higher-selling games also being Nintendo 64 games. By the end of 1997 it had sold over a million copies. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the arcade version 63rd on its &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot;

Reviewing the Virtual Console release in &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, Damien McFerran echoed many of the original criticisms about jerky frame rate, poor collision detection, and lack of speed and excitement, and said that even the arcade original is a fairly poor game.

<doc id="938788" wikidata="Q1089932" url="?curid=938788" title="Church's Texas Chicken">
<text>Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken is an American fast food restaurant chain that specializes in fried chicken and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The chain was founded as Church&#x27;s Fried Chicken To-Go by George W. Church Sr. in April 1952, in San Antonio, Texas, across the street from The Alamo. Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken trades as Texas Chicken or Church&#x27;s Chicken in many countries. The chain is owned by American private equity firm High Bluff Capital Partners.
As of 2017, Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken had more than 1,700 franchised and company-owned locations in 26 countries.

==History==

In 1952, retired chicken incubator salesman George W. Church Sr. opened the first Church&#x27;s Chicken, named Church&#x27;s Fried Chicken To-Go, in San Antonio, Texas.

Initially, Church&#x27;s Chicken was a single walk-up establishment that only sold fried chicken. Two pieces of chicken and a roll cost 49 cents. Church&#x27;s Chicken added fries and jalapeños to its menu in 1955. To allow customers to see their food prepared while they waited, Church Sr. designed the kitchen with the fryers next to the takeout window.

===Early expansion, franchising and sale===
The company had four restaurants by the time of Church Sr.&#x27;s death in 1956. After his death, family members took over operations. In 1962, with Church Sr.&#x27;s son Bill Church Jr. as top executive, there were eight restaurants in San Antonio. To begin expanding and franchising in 1965, Church Jr. and his brother Richard developed a signature marinade that could be prepared at any location. Former vacuum cleaner salesman J. David Bamberger, who first met Church Jr. when he joined Bamberger&#x27;s vacuum cleaner distributorship, joined Church&#x27;s Chicken in 1965 to oversee the franchising. In 1967, the chain opened restaurants in five Texan cities outside of San Antonio and operated 17 restaurants in 1968.

In 1966, a contract between Church&#x27;s Fried Chicken, Inc. and Jim Dandy Fast Foods, Inc. gave Jim Dandy the right to use the trade names and trademarks &quot;Church&#x27;s Fried Chicken&quot; or &quot;Church&#x27;s&quot; within fifty miles of Houston&#x27;s city hall and within the city limits of Galveston, Texas for ten years, as long as Church&#x27;s Chicken received the agreed upon royalties.

In 1968, the Church family sold the company, which became incorporated and went public in 1969. By the end of 1968, there were more than 100 Church&#x27;s Chicken restaurants in seven states, making the chain the first from Texas to become a national one. Between 1969 and 1974, Church&#x27;s Chicken gained 387 more restaurants.

In the late 1970s, the chain briefly operated a hamburger franchise in Texas called G.W. Jrs. The roughly 60 locations were shuttered in 1985.

In 1980, Church Jr. resigned as corporation chairman, and was replaced by childhood friend, Roger Harvin.

In March 1996, Hala Moddelmog was appointed president of Church&#x27;s Chicken, making her the first female president of a fast food restaurant chain.

===Global and national expansion===
Church&#x27;s Chicken began its international expansion in the 1970s, in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Puerto Rico. In the 1980s, it gained popularity in Indonesia when it opened under the trade name, &quot;Texas Chicken&quot;. The first reason of changing the name into &quot;Texas&quot; is because the brand name &quot;Church&quot; was not popular in countries with majority non-Christian religions, such as Indonesia. Afterwards, locations in Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and the Philippines were also opened under the trade name &quot;Texas Chicken&quot;.

In February 2008, Church&#x27;s Chicken entered the UK market under the &quot;Texas Chicken&quot; name, claiming to have signed up 50 former Dixy Chicken franchisees. Only a small number of restaurants opened, with one in High Road Leytonstone, London, and another in Salford, Greater Manchester. They withdrew from the UK a few years later.

In 2017, Church&#x27;s Chicken announced a multi-year development deal with Goalz Restaurant Group, LLC to develop 20 Church&#x27;s Chicken restaurants each year in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Colorado, North Carolina and South Carolina.

In 2022, Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken operated more than 1,500 locations worldwide. Its international locations include Bahrain, Belarus, Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Singapore, St. Lucia, Thailand, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Vietnam.

However, Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken operation in Thailand, which is operated under license by PTT OR (PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited) as Texas Chicken was discontinued on 30 September 2024 as it was announced in their official Facebook page after 9 years of its operation. Until 30 September 2024, PTT OR operates 97 Texas Chicken locations nationwide in Thailand.

===Acquisitions===
In 1989, after a four-month legal dispute to avoid a takeover, Church&#x27;s Chicken became the second-largest chicken restaurant chain when it was acquired by Popeyes for $330 million. The acquisition court documents stated that Church&#x27;s Chicken would close 250 of its restaurants, &quot;keep 92 with the Church&#x27;s name, rename 303 others as Popeyes and sell 440 others for about $160 million over the next four years&quot;. Merrill Lynch and a group of banks led by Canadian Imperial financed the acquisition.

In 1992, Popeyes&#x27; parent company, Al Copeland Enterprises, Inc., was forced to file chapter 11 bankruptcy for the more than $400 million debt it owed its creditors for the Church&#x27;s Chicken buyout. In 1993, Al Copeland Enterprises, Inc. was renamed AFC Enterprises, Inc., or America&#x27;s Favorite Chicken, and became the parent company of Church&#x27;s Chicken and Popeyes.

In 2004, Arcapita bought Church&#x27;s Chicken from AFC Enterprises, Inc., and former Domino&#x27;s Pizza and Little Caesars executive Harsha Agadi became president and CEO of Church&#x27;s Chicken. In 2005, because Arcapita invests in companies that respect Shari&#x27;ah principles, it removed pork products from the Church&#x27;s Chicken menu.

In 2007, AFC Enterprises, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Church&#x27;s Chicken and former franchise group CVI Company, for allegedly colluding to breach Popeyes&#x27; franchise, development and guaranty agreements with CVI, when &quot;Church&#x27;s [Chicken] bought all 10 of CVI&#x27;s Popeyes&#x27; restaurants and converted most of them to the Church&#x27;s Chicken brand&quot;.

In August 2009, San Francisco private equity firm Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe bought Church&#x27;s Chicken from Arcapita, for an estimated value of $390 million. In June 2019, Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe placed the company up for sale, after years of declining sales and store counts.

In August 2021, Church&#x27;s Chicken was acquired by High Bluff-backed Rego Restaurant Group, the owners of Quiznos and Taco del Mar.

===Co-franchising===
By the mid-to late-1990s, Church&#x27;s Chicken and hamburger chain White Castle announced their co-franchise, in which both companies would sell their own separate products, while operating in some shared restaurant spaces, with some shared personnel. In Canada, Church&#x27;s Chicken items were once available in Harvey&#x27;s restaurants, but the co-venture was discontinued.

==Products==

Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken menu features a variety of fried chicken options alongside classic sides and desserts. Their menu also includes chicken tenders, and boneless wings.

Other menu highlights include Spicy Chicken, Chicken Tenders, and Boneless Wings. Accompanying these main dishes are classic Southern sides such as mashed potatoes with gravy, fried okra, coleslaw, corn on the cob and jalapeño peppers. Desserts include honey butter biscuits and apple pie. Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken restaurants offer a seasonal seafood menu, featuring shrimp and crispy fish.

Since 1952, Church&#x27;s Texas Chicken restaurants have served beverages supplied by The Coca-Cola Company. In 2008, the companies reaffirmed their commitment with the renewal of their existing contract, continuing to provide customers with beloved Coca-Cola beverages. In 2021, Church&#x27;s Chicken appointed Performance Food Group Company as its exclusive distributor in the United States to 2026.

==Sponsorship and philanthropy==
From 1979 to 1986, Church&#x27;s Chicken sponsored the ChessCafe Grand Prix tournaments, under the auspices of the United States Chess Federation.

Church&#x27;s Partners Foundation, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) charity that supports the employees of franchisees of Church&#x27;s Chicken, their families and their communities. The foundation awards $1,000 scholarships to American high school students through their Church&#x27;s Scholars Program and awarded over $227,000 worth of scholarships in the 2018–2019 academic year.

Church&#x27;s Chicken has partnered with No Kid Hungry since 2016.

==Incidents==
===United States===
====Oklahoma restaurant closures====
In 2015, the Oklahoma Tax Commission shuttered 15 Church&#x27;s Chicken restaurants owned by the Reciprocity Restaurant Group LLC, for not paying more than $400,000 in sales taxes to the state of Oklahoma.

====Data breach====
In 2019, Church&#x27;s Chicken launched an investigation into a data breach of their payment processing systems. At least 160 company-owned restaurants in 11 states were impacted.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most Church&#x27;s Chicken restaurants closed their dining rooms and continued their drive-thru, counter, takeout and delivery services.

In March 2020, company executives announced a franchisee relief plan, where Church&#x27;s Chicken franchisees could defer 50% of their royalties and ad fund contributions for the next four weeks.

<text>Leslie Michael Grantham (30 April 1947 – 15 June 2018) was an English actor who played &quot;Dirty&quot; Den Watts in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. He was a convicted murderer, having served 10 years for the killing of a West German taxi driver, and had significant press coverage resulting from an online sex scandal in 2004.

==Early life==
Grantham was born in Camberwell, London, the son of Adelaide (&quot;née&quot; Flinders) and Walter William Grantham (1915–1998). He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers regiment of the British Army in 1965, aged 18.

==Murder conviction==
Grantham was soon posted to West Germany, where he quickly found himself in debt to army colleagues. He resorted to criminal activities in his attempt to clear the debt.

On 3 December 1966, Grantham attempted to rob a taxi driver, Felix Reese, in Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, by threatening him at gunpoint and demanding money. In a struggle between the two men, Grantham shot Reese, who died from a gunshot wound to the head. Grantham was arrested soon afterwards and charged with murder. 

In his statement to the police following his arrest, Grantham said that he did not know the gun was loaded and it had gone off during the struggle, which would have resulted in a conviction for manslaughter had a jury believed this version of events. However, at his trial in April 1967, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Although he had committed the murder in West Germany, he served the entirety of his sentence in British prisons. This was because soldiers and officers convicted of any criminal offence that warrants a sentence of over two years were automatically transferred to Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service, since they are also automatically dishonourably discharged.

Grantham was paroled in 1977, having served 10 years of his life sentence. While he was being held at Leyhill Prison (an open prison in Gloucestershire) near the end of his imprisonment, he performed in several plays for inmates and members of the public, and edited the prison newspaper. He was encouraged to get more involved in acting professionally by the disgraced Labour politician T. Dan Smith, who was also an inmate at Leyhill in the mid-1970s. Grantham also met actress Louise Jameson during her visit to Leyhill near the end of his imprisonment; she had also encouraged him to take up acting, and he became good friends with her.

==Career==
===Early work===
On release from prison, Grantham decided to pursue an acting career and trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. His theatre work included a role in a play at the Battersea Free Theatre written by television director Matthew Robinson. In 1982, Grantham made his television debut as Boollie in a &quot;BBC2 Playhouse&quot; edition called &quot;Jake&#x27;s End&quot;. The following year he appeared as Frank on an episode of the short lived sitcom &quot;Goodnight and God Bless&quot;. Grantham was then cast by Matthew Robinson as Kiston, the henchman of Davros, in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (1984). He also played a signals sergeant in episode 12 of the television mini-series &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot; (1984) and wrote a play entitled &quot;A Reason To Live&quot;, which won the Gloucester Drama Festival award for Best Original Play. He made a brief appearance in the Mike Hodges film &quot;Morons from Outer Space&quot; (1985), but by the time the film was released, Grantham had gained his best known role.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
In 1984, Grantham auditioned with the BBC for a part in its new soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, which aired in February 1985. He was recommended by Matthew Robinson, who was to become a key member of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; production team. Grantham had auditioned for the role of market trader Pete Beale, but he was offered the part of Den Watts. The character, landlord of The Queen Victoria public house, quickly became a national favourite, and gained the nickname Dirty Den, mostly because of the unpleasant way he treated his wife Angie, played by Anita Dobson; one of the character&#x27;s many affairs occurred at the age of 39, when he fathered a child with 16-year-old Michelle Fowler.

On 25 December 1986, Grantham&#x27;s character served his on-screen wife with divorce papers, with the line &quot;Happy Christmas, Ange.&quot; The episode was watched by a record 30 million viewers, over half the British population at the time.

In 1988, the character sold his pub to Frank Butcher, played by Mike Reid, and gradually drifted out of key storylines, until finally departing in February 1989, although his final scenes had been filmed the previous autumn. Grantham had announced his intention to leave the soap early in 1988, around the same time that it was announced that Dobson would be leaving. However, the series&#x27; bosses had not wanted to suffer the double blow of losing its two biggest characters so close together, and set about an intensive block of filming that would allow Den to remain on screen into 1989, while enabling Grantham to continue on &quot;EastEnders&quot; until autumn 1988.

Den had become involved with a criminal organisation called &quot;The Firm&quot; over the summer of 1988, and his only option was to flee the Square. After spending time on the run in Manchester, Den spent several months on remand in custody for his role in arranging the arson attack on The Dagmar pub (an act of revenge against James Wilmott-Brown for the rape of Kathy Beale), and a dramatic escape from the police and from members of The Firm who ambushed him on his way to court, viewers watched a mysterious gunman shoot at Den with a gun hidden in a bunch of daffodils, before hearing a splash at the end of the episode which aired on 23 February 1989. 

A shot depicting Den&#x27;s death was cut from the final scene, in the hope that Grantham might one day be persuaded to return to the role. The following year, a body believed to be Den&#x27;s was found in the canal.

===Other work===
Grantham played Danny Kane in the crime television series &quot;The Paradise Club&quot; (1989–90) alongside Don Henderson. He went on to appear in the fourth season of &quot;Cluedo&quot; as Colonel Mustard; he had previously appeared as a contestant on the 1990 Christmas special.

Grantham also appeared on &quot;The Detectives&quot; (1993) and &quot;99-1&quot; (1994–95). In 1994, he narrated volume one of Frank Harris&#x27;s erotic classic &quot;My Life and Loves&quot;. In 1997, he produced and starred in the sci-fi mini-series &quot;The Uninvited&quot;.

Alongside Melinda Messenger, Grantham was the co-host of the game show &quot;Fort Boyard&quot; from 1998 to 2001. Also in 2001, he appeared in &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;. He also reunited with his &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star Anita Dobson in the two-part mini-series &quot;The Stretch&quot; which aired on Sky One in 2000, and in the British gangster film &quot;Charlie&quot; (2004).

===Return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;===
During the 1990s, Grantham was approached more than once by BBC bosses about a possible return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;, but rejected each of these offers, often feeling that the storyline at the time would not be the right one to suit any potential comeback.

However, on 3 May 2003, it was confirmed that Grantham would be returning to &quot;EastEnders&quot; later that year to reprise his role as Den after 14 years. On 29 September 2003, his return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; was aired, with him arriving at the nightclub E20 now owned by his adopted daughter Sharon, portrayed by Letitia Dean.

It was revealed that Den had survived the shooting and fled to Spain with the help of former mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), while the body found a year later in the canal had been wrongly identified. 16.66 million viewers watched one of the most anticipated television events of the year on 29 September, as Den spoke the words, &quot;Hello, princess.&quot;

There had been much speculation in the media after Den&#x27;s departure as to whether the character really was dead, particularly after the original search of the canal site where he was shot failed to uncover any trace of him. BBC bosses said that Den&#x27;s return had been on the agenda almost every year since the character&#x27;s departure in 1989, and the first offer for him to return had been made as long ago as 1991. Grantham had turned down every offer to return until the offer which was made to him in early 2003, feeling that his character did not have adequate links to the show for a comeback to be anything more than an attempt to boost ratings, particularly when Den&#x27;s daughter Sharon was away from 1995 to 2001, leaving Den without any family in the cast. By 2003, however, his daughter Vicki had returned, and a previously unknown son, Dennis Rickman, was also in the series, being the product of an affair between Den and a young woman called Paula Rickman 30 years earlier.

In December 2004, Den arranged a scam to get back The Queen Vic from Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf), 16 years after he had sold it to Frank.

===Online sex scandal===
In May 2004, a Sunday newspaper printed photographs of Grantham exposing himself and masturbating whilst sucking his finger in a sexually-suggestive manner via a webcam from his dressing room to an undercover reporter named &quot;Amanda&quot;. Grantham also allegedly dressed as Captain Hook whilst pleasuring himself, and insulted several cast members of &quot;EastEnders, &quot;including Shane Richie (Alfie Moon), Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler), Kim Medcalf (Sam Mitchell) and Jessie Wallace (Kat Moon). Grantham released a statement which read, &quot;I am wholeheartedly ashamed of my behaviour and feel that I have let down my colleagues, as well as my friends and family.&quot; He also added, &quot;In some small recompense I intend to make a donation to charity as a mark of my apology.&quot; He maintained in later interviews that he &#x27;was set up&#x27;. He attempted suicide three times as a result of the scandal. In addition, in 2018 it was reported that he had been investigated by police for sexually abusing a schoolgirl, although the alleged victim ultimately decided not to pursue the matter.

===Departure from &quot;EastEnders&quot;===
In November 2004, it was confirmed that Grantham would be leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot; in the New Year. Bosses stated that the character would be killed off, but this time &quot;the coffin lid would be nailed shut&quot;.

On 18 February 2005, 14.34 million viewers tuned in to view his character&#x27;s second demise, this time at the hands of second wife Chrissie, portrayed by Tracy-Ann Oberman, who hit him over the head with a dog-shaped iron doorstop during a confrontation in the Vic.

===After &quot;EastEnders&quot;===
Grantham later appeared in two UK tours of &quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt&quot;, a stage adaptation of a Jeffrey Archer play, alongside Simon Ward and Alexandra Bastedo, and performed as a Christmas pantomime villain. He directed and starred in a pantomime of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Alban Arena in St Albans during Christmas 2005. 

In October 2006, it was announced that, in his first television role since leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot;, he would appear in the long-running ITV1 police drama series &quot;The Bill&quot;, playing the role of Jimmy Collins, who was on the run from prison. The episode aired on 8 February 2007. This was Grantham&#x27;s second appearance in &quot;The Bill&quot;.

In February 2010, Grantham appeared in &quot;EastEnders: The Aftermath&quot; on BBC Three to mark the live episode of the show and its 25th birthday. He was interviewed by Kirsten O&#x27;Brien from the bar of The Queen Victoria pub which his character had once owned. Grantham was also cast for the lead role in the UK thriller movie &quot;DeadTime&quot;.

From 28 November to 11 December 2010, Grantham appeared as Ebenezer Scrooge in the Lincoln Theatre Royal&#x27;s production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. He portrayed the main character John in the Bulgarian TV series &quot;The English Neighbour&quot;, based on the novel of the same name. In 2015, he appeared in the film &quot;Mob Handed&quot; (released in 2016) directed by Liam Galvin, playing a detective.

==Personal life and death==
Grantham married Australian Jane Laurie in 1981. The couple had three sons and divorced in 2013. His son Daniel Laurie is also an actor, and plays Reggie Jackson in &quot;Call the Midwife.&quot;

In June 2018, it was reported that Grantham had returned to the United Kingdom from his home in Bulgaria to receive treatment for lung cancer. He died on 15 June 2018, aged 71. That evening&#x27;s episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; featured a tribute to Grantham, whilst his co-star and on-screen wife Anita Dobson described him as &quot;a wonderful and special actor, witty and very talented.&quot; She added &quot;I shall remember him very fondly and with affection.&quot;

<doc id="938791" wikidata="Q1188538" url="?curid=938791" title="List of Street Fighter series characters">
<text>The main titles of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fighting game series have introduced a varied cast of 87 characters from the main series, and 34 from several spin-offs, for a total of 121 playable characters who originate from 24 countries, each with his or her unique fighting style. This is a list of playable characters and non-playable opponents from the whole franchise. They are categorized based on the game in which they first became playable, including the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series, the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; series, the &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; series, &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; and other related games.

==Characters==
In addition to the characters below, several titles have also introduced characters to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series that are considered canon only to their respective media. This includes the Monitor Cyborg for the &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot; and related game, Shin from the browser video game &quot;Street Fighter Online: Mouse Generation&quot;, and the characters Blade, Arkane, Kyber, F7, and Sawada from the arcade game based on the 1994 &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film. Several characters from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise also appear in &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; and its subsequent re-releases and sequels. While these games introduce new characters, they have been since expanded into their own franchise under the &quot;Fighting EX Layer&quot; series, and ties to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; cast removed. &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; was the first main series entry to include playable third-party guest characters, adding two fighters from SNK&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series.

More detailed information on the characters can be found under their respective games, while the characters of the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; series and those of the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; series can be found on their respective standalone lists.

<doc id="938802" wikidata="Q537224" url="?curid=938802" title="Charles Helou">
<text>Charles Helou (25 September 1913 – 7 January 2001) was a Lebanese politician who served as the 4th president of Lebanon from 1964 to 1970.

== Early life and education ==

Born in Beirut on 25 September 1913, Helou was the scion of a powerful Maronite family from Baabda. He graduated with honours from St. Joseph&#x27;s University in Beirut in 1929, and went on to complete a law degree in 1934. Helou worked in his early years as a journalist at the French language newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Eclair du Nord&quot;. He was also at one time the political editor of &quot;Le Jour&quot;, a French daily newspaper owned by his close friend Michel Chiha. In 1936, he made his first foray into politics, when he joined with Pierre Gemayel and three others in launching the Kataeb (Phalangist) Party. Differences with Gemayel later led Helou to quit the party, however.

== Career ==
Helou&#x27;s first governmental appointment was as ambassador to the Vatican in 1947. In 1949 he took part in the Israel/Lebanese armistice negotiations where Israel tried to gain diplomatic concessions in exchange for the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese Sovereign territory. He later served in the Cabinet as minister of justice and health (1954–1955) and as minister of education (1964). Initially, Helou&#x27;s lack of political affiliation gave him the appearance of a leader able to unite Lebanon and he was chosen to succeed Fuad Chehab as president by the National Assembly in 1964.

The alliance between Chehab and Lebanese prime minister Rashid Karami, a staunch Arab nationalist, soon left Karami in effective control of the Lebanese government. Helou founded and launched the Institute for Palestine Studies in 1963. The most pressing issue that was first to cause problems for Helou was the Israeli diversion of the Jordan River.

The impressive economic growth that characterized Helou&#x27;s presidency translated into a cultural and lifestyle belle époque in Lebanon (perhaps this gained the name for Beirut as the &#x27;Paris of the Orient&#x27; and Lebanon as the &#x27;Switzerland of the East&#x27;) was due to the efforts launched by the former President Chehab. However this period was also partly marred by the Intra Bank crisis of 1966 and Lebanon&#x27;s increasing inability to avoid involvement in the Arab–Israeli conflict. The Six-Day War of 1967, strained sectarian relations in Lebanon. Many Muslims wanted Lebanon to join the Arab war effort, while many Christians wished to eschew participation. Helou managed to keep Lebanon from entanglement, apart from a brief air strike, but found it impossible to put the lid on the tensions that had been raised. Parliamentary elections in 1968 revealed an increasing polarization in the country, with two major coalitions, one pro-Arab Nationalism, led by Rashid Karami and the other pro-Western, led jointly by former President Camille Chamoun, Pierre Gemayel and Raymond Eddé, both made major gains and won 30 of the 99 seats each.

In addition, government authority was challenged by the presence of armed Palestinian guerrillas in the south of the country, and clashes between the Lebanese army and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) became increasingly frequent. For a long time, Helou resisted their demands, but in 1969, after failing to end the rebellion militarily, he finally gave in, hoping that the Palestinian guerrillas would confine their operations to cross-border attacks against Israel and would stop challenging the Lebanese government. As it turned out, the clashes only intensified.

In 1970, Helou endorsed Elias Sarkis as his chosen successor, but the latter lost the election in the National Assembly by one vote to Suleiman Frangieh. Unlike other former presidents, who remained politically active after retirement, Helou faded from the scene. He was involved in a philanthropic venture, founding a number of restaurants to provide free hot meals to elderly people.

== Personal life ==
In 1952, he married Nina Trad, niece of Petro Trad, who served as President of the French Mandate of Lebanon and under whom he had studied law. Trad was one of the first women lawyers in Lebanon.

== Death ==
Helou died of a heart attack on 7 January 2001. He was 87.

<text>Stephen George Bull (born 28 March 1965) is an English former professional footballer who is best remembered for his 13-year spell at Wolverhampton Wanderers. He played there from 1986 until his retirement from playing in 1999, and holds the club&#x27;s goalscoring record with 306 goals, which included 18 hat-tricks for the club.

He was capped 13 times for the England team between 1989 and 1990, scoring four goals.

==Playing career==

===Early years===
Bull was born in Tipton and started school in September 1969 at Wednesbury Oak Primary School and moved up to Willingsworth High School in September 1976, by which time he was excelling in school football teams. The junior teams he played for included Ocker Hill infants, Red Lion and Newey Goodman. He left school in 1981 to join non-league Tipton Town. During this time he also held down a succession of factory jobs in addition to playing local league games.

He began his professional career, aged 19, after being recommended to West Bromwich Albion in 1984 by his Tipton Town manager Sid Day, who also worked as a scout for the Baggies. After initially having to train with the club&#x27;s youth ranks, he was quickly offered a pro contract and moved into first team contention. He made his senior debut on 23 October 1985, replacing Garth Crooks in a 2–1 Full Members Cup win against Crystal Palace. He made his league debut as a substitute against QPR, away, on 12 April 1986 (lost 1–0), and his full debut at home to Sheffield Wednesday on 22 April (drew 1-1); they were his only league appearances that season and only appearances in top flight football.

Bull played three Second Division games for Albion after they were relegated in 1986, scoring twice, and also scored one goal in two League Cup appearances for the club. Bull knew it would be difficult to break the Crooks/Varadi partnership, so was prepared to drop to the bottom tier in search of first team football. In November 1986, he was sold to local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, along with Andy Thompson, for £65,000 where he remained until the end of his professional career in 1999, being one of Wolves&#x27; most loyal players.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Bull&#x27;s debut for Wolves, then languishing in the Fourth Division, was against Wrexham on 22 November 1986. His first goal for the club came on 2 December 1986 in the Associate Members&#x27; Cup as Wolves beat Cardiff City 1–0 at Ninian Park.

In over 13 years at Wolves, Bull broke four of the club&#x27;s goalscoring records. He became their all-time leading goalscorer with 306 goals in competitive games (250 of them in the Football League, also a club record) and became their highest goalscorer in a single season when he scored 52 goals in competitive games during the 1987–88 season. Bull also scored a club record of 18 hat-tricks - the first of them against Hartlepool United in a 4-1 Fourth Division home win on 9 May 1987, the last on 17 August 1996 in a 3-0 Division One away win over Grimsby Town.

Bull&#x27;s first season at the club saw him score a total of 19 goals for Wolves - 15 of them in the Fourth Division, in which they finished fourth - although they lost out on promotion after being beaten by Aldershot in the playoffs.

In the 1987–88 season, Wolves won the Fourth Division championship and became the first of only five teams (later matched by Burnley, Preston North End, Portsmouth and Sheffield United) to have been champions of all four divisions in the English league. Bull&#x27;s impressive total of 52 goals in all competitions during the season included 34 goals in the league, with league hat-tricks against Exeter City and Darlington. He also scored hat-tricks in cup competitions against Cheltenham Town and Brentford. His 50th goal came just 15 months after signing for Wolves, when he found the net twice in a 4–0 home win against Peterborough United on 9 February 1988.

On 24 January 1989, after just over two years at the club, he took his Wolves goal tally to over 100 with a hat-trick in a Third Division game against Bristol City at Molineux, which Wolves won 3–0. 

In the 1988–89 season, Bull inspired Wolves to a second successive promotion, this time as Third Division champions, with 50 goals - marking a tally of 102 goals in two seasons. While still playing in the Third Division, he was selected for the England team and scored on his debut against Scotland at Hampden Park. Thirty-seven of his goals that season came in the league for Wolves. He achieved his first four-goal haul on 26 November 1988 in a 6–0 home win over Preston North End, scoring a hat-trick the following month in a 6–2 home victory over Mansfield Town. He managed a third league hat-trick that season in a 5–2 February home win over Fulham. He also scored freely in the cups, scoring four against Port Vale in the Associate Members&#x27; Cup and then against Bristol City in the same competition.

In 1989–90, he finally played Second Division football for Wolves, his first goal at this level coming on 26 August 1989 in a 1–1 home draw with Bradford City. On Boxing Day, he scored his 10th Second Division goal of the season, before impressively grabbing all four goals for Wolves in their 4–1 win at promotion-chasing Newcastle United on New Year&#x27;s Day 1990. On 20 March, in the Black Country derby at Molineux (the first to be played there for six years), as Wolves beat struggling Albion 2–1 to boost their promotion hopes, Bull scored his 20th league goal of the campaign. A hat-trick against Leicester City followed a month later, and he finished that campaign with 24 league goals and 26 in all competitions, although Wolves missed out on the playoffs and the chance of a third successive promotion.

He started the 1990–91 season in style with both goals at home to promotion favourites Oldham Athletic, who came away from the Molineux with a 3–2 victory. These goals took his tally in all competitions to 150 goals in just under four years with Wolves. A hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over Bristol City took him to 11 Second Division goals by 6 October, and he reached the 20-goal margin (for the fourth season running) on 26 February as they beat Port Vale 3–1 at home. A hat-trick at home to Oxford United in a thrilling 3–3 draw came the following month, and Bull finished the season with 25 goals in the league and 26 in all competitions, although once again Wolves missed out on the playoffs and the chance of promotion.

Late in the 1991-92 season, he scored his 195th competitive goal for Wolves after just over five years at the club, breaking the club&#x27;s decade-old goalscoring record set by John Richards. Early in the following season he became the first player to score 200 goals for Wolves, less than six years after signing. It came on 18 August 1992 in a 3–0 home win over Leicester City in the new Division One, as the Second Division was renamed that year with the creation of the new FA Premier League as the top division of English football.

At the end of the 1994-95 season, when Wolves finished fourth in Division One but lost in the playoff semi-finals, Bull came close to making a £1.5 million transfer to Premier League club Coventry City, then managed by Ron Atkinson, but ultimately turned it down. Bull revealed in a 2012 interview that Torino, Celtic and Newcastle United also showed an interest in signing him while he was at Wolves. Media reports at different stages of his career also linked him with moves to numerous other top division clubs. During the 1991-92 season, press reports suggested he was a transfer target for Leeds United, who went on to win the league title that season.

He scored his 250th goal for Wolves in a 1–1 league draw with Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park on 3 May 1995.

Bull played only one game in the English top flight — coming on as a substitute, ironically replacing Andy Thompson (who would follow him to Wolves the following season), for West Bromwich Albion in 1986 — the rest of his career was spent in the lower divisions. He came close to achieving his ambition of reaching the Premier League in 1995 and 1997, but Wolves lost in the play-offs both times.

During his final two seasons at Molineux, his chances of first-team football were reduced by a series of knee injuries. He reached the 300-goal milestone on 18 February 1998, scoring in a 2–0 home win over Bradford City in the league. It was the last of nine goals he would score for Wolves that season, as he missed many games due to injuries.

He scored his last hat-trick in all competitions, two years after his final league hat-trick, on 18 August 1998 in a 5–0 home win over Barnet in the Football League Cup first round first leg.

Bull&#x27;s final goal for the club came against Bury on 26 September 1998 and his final competitive appearance for the club came on the last day of the 1998–99 season against Bradford City. By January 1999, however, reports were circulating that Bull would soon be retiring as a player due to an ongoing knee problem.

On 13 July 1999, at the age of 34, Bull finally admitted defeat in his battle to fully regain fitness and announced his retirement after 13 years with Wolves.

However, he soon returned to playing as player-coach of Hereford United for a season in the Conference, working with Graham Turner, the manager who had signed him for Wolves.

Known by his fans as &#x27;Bully&#x27; for his club loyalty, rapport with supporters and passion for the game and also known as the &quot;Tipton Skin&quot; for his trademark closely cropped haircut, he received an MBE for services to Association Football in December 1999, shortly after retiring as a first class player.

Bull is regarded as a legend at Wolves and one of the main stands at their home ground, Molineux, is named after him. This commemoration was made in June 2003, with the stand having previously been known as the &quot;John Ireland Stand&quot;.

On 29 July 2006, Bull made one final appearance for Wolves in his 20th anniversary testimonial game against Aston Villa at Molineux, playing the first seven minutes of the match.

==International career==
Bull was capped 13 times by England, and scored 4 goals, all coming in the buildup to Italia 90. He scored his first goal on his debut after replacing an injured John Fashanu against Scotland on 27 May 1989, with a low right-footed shot to the net. Two more goals came in a friendly against Czechoslovakia on 25 April 1990. His final England goal came against Tunisia, which earned him a place in Bobby Robson&#x27;s World Cup squad.

Despite starting his international career well, he did not score another goal for England after this. He played four times during Italia 90 – three times as a substitute against Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium and once as a starter against Egypt. His final match for England was on 17 October 1990 against Poland, but he was not picked again by his future Wolves manager, Graham Taylor.

Bull was still technically a Third Division player when he won his first cap, at the end of the 1988–89 season, as Wolves had not yet played in Division Two after their promotion that season. He remains the last player to be capped by England from outside the top two tiers, and one of only five post-war players so honoured.

In total, he scored nine goals in 23 appearances for his country at full, U-21 and &quot;B&quot; team levels.

==Management career==
On 21 February 2008, Bull entered management with Conference National side Stafford Rangers. He had previously worked as a coach at this level with Hereford United in the 2000–01 season and had completed his UEFA Pro B coaching licence in the years in between. The team was in the relegation zone at the time of his appointment and he was unable to prevent relegation. He parted company with the club on 12 December 2008.

==Personal life==
He is the cousin of West Bromwich born former footballer Gary Bull, who played for clubs including Barnet, Nottingham Forest and Birmingham City. In November 2022, Bull launched his own clothing line entitled &#x27;SB9&#x27; using the famous gold and black; it comprises t-shirts, hoodies, caps, beanies, polos, gilets, track suit trousers and shorts.

<text>Thomas Parnell (11 September 1679 – 24 October 1718) was an Anglo-Irish poet and clergyman who was a friend of both Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift.

He was born in Dublin, the eldest son of Thomas Parnell (died 1685) of Maryborough, Queen&#x27;s County (now Portlaoise, County Laois), a prosperous landowner who had been a loyal supporter of Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War and moved from Congleton, Cheshire to Ireland after the Restoration of Charles II. His mother was Anne Grice of Kilosty, County Tipperary: she also owned property in County Armagh, which she left to Thomas at her death in 1709. His parents married in Dublin in 1674. Thomas was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and collated as Archdeacon of Clogher in 1705. In the last years of the reign of Queen Anne of England he was a popular preacher, but her death put an end to his hope of career advancement. He married Anne (Nancy) Minchin, daughter of Thomas Minchin, who died in 1712, and had three children, two of whom died young. The third child, a girl, is said to have reached a great age. The marriage was a very happy one, and it has been said that Thomas never recovered from Nancy&#x27;s early death.

He spent much of his time in London, where he participated with Pope, Swift and others in the Scriblerus Club, contributing to &quot;The Spectator&quot; and aiding Pope in his translation of The Iliad. He was also one of the so-called &quot;Graveyard poets&quot;: his &#x27;A Night-Piece on Death,&#x27; widely considered the first &quot;Graveyard School&quot; poem, was published posthumously in &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot;, collected and edited by Alexander Pope and is thought by some scholars to have been published in December 1721 (although dated in 1722 on its title page, the year accepted by &quot;The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature&quot;; see 1721 in poetry, 1722 in poetry). It is said of his poetry, &quot;it was in keeping with his character, easy and pleasing, enunciating the common places with felicity and grace.&quot;

He was a very heavy drinker, especially after his wife&#x27;s early death, and drinking undermined his health. He died in Chester in 1718 on his way home to Ireland. His wife and two sons having died, his Laois estate passed to his brother John, a judge and MP in the Irish House of Commons, and the ancestor of Charles Stewart Parnell.

Oliver Goldsmith wrote a biography of Parnell which often accompanied later editions of Parnell&#x27;s works. Poet Azizunnessa Khatun translated one of Parnell&#x27;s works into the Bengali language under the title &quot;Udasīn Kabbo&quot; in 1884.

==Works==
*&quot;Essay on the Different Stiles of Poetry&quot; (1713)
*&quot;Battle of the Frogs and Mice&quot; (1717 translation in heroic couplets of a comic epic then attributed to Homer)

An example of his poetry is the opening stanza of his poem &quot;The Hermit&quot;:&lt;poem&gt;Far in the wild, unknown to public view,
From youth to age a revered hermit grew.
The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,
His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well.
Remote from man with God he passed his days
Prayer all his business, all his pleasure, praise. &lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Llameros (lit. &quot;people who drive llamas&quot;; also known as pastores or caravaneros) are indigenous peasants who run llama caravans throughout the Andes of South America. 

During the Inca Empire, llameros were high-ranking officials tasked with managing the emperor&#x27;s llama and alpaca herds, and facilitating trade and communication throughout the empire. Nowadays, roads have reduced the need for llameros, and they now mostly serve isolated mountain villages inaccessible by road. 

== History ==
Llama caravans have been historically used by Andean people for transport of goods and people. With the modernization of transport in Bolivia, as well as climatic and economic changes, llamas have been significantly replaced by motorized vehicles.

Llameros are usually fluent in Quechua and Spanish. They do not use money for the exchange of goods, instead relying on bartering alone. Some groups are composed of family members, including young boys and women.

<text>Napolact is the main Romanian brand which belongs to the Dutch company FrieslandCampina and it’s one of the biggest dairy producers in Romania. It owns three production facilities in Cluj (Baciu), Târgu Mureș and Țaga.

==History==
In 1905, “Atelierul Vlad” (Vlad&#x27;s workshop), was certified in Cluj-Napoca as a producer of dairy products, more specifically, butter and cottage cheese. They grew steadily until 1936 by which time they had expanded their portfolio to yoghurt and fermented and melted cheese. The small dairy factory was nationalized in 1948 when the government took over control of all private industries at the time. Since then it was known as “The Milk Industrialization Enterprise Cluj” until 1990 when they became known as simply “Napolact”. Shortly after, in 1994, Napolact received numerous prizes and distinctions from the Romanian government for its high-quality products. With high average production capacity, Napolact had become the leader of the Romanian dairy market by 1998. Their success came from the strong relationship they developed and maintained with their milk producers through considerable investments in their farms each year. Following a simple rule they strengthened the relationship: each farmer that had at least seven but no more than ten cows would receive a sum of money which they had to pay back without interest with the purpose of acquiring seven more cows. In 2004 the majority of their shares was bought by the Friesland company.

==Production and distribution==
Currently the production is done at the Baciu dairy factory, Târgu Mureș dairy factory and the distribution consists of two warehouses in Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest from which stores situated all over Romania are supplied. 
For all of the Napolact products, the FrieslandCampina company uses raw milk exclusively obtained from farmers in Ardeal all year long.

==Modernization==
Starting all the way back in 1990, the company has been through many modernization processes. The most important ones have been implemented after 2004 when Napolact had been taken over by Friesland and the introduction of European factory standards. Thus, the factories in Baciu and Targu Mures had received major improvements to both their quality level and production capacity. 
In 2014, Napolact opened their first store with a coffee shop in Cluj-Napoca.

==Products==
The product portfolio of Napolact covers most of the main dairy products and they are as follows:
* Milk
* Yoghurts 
* Buttermilk
* Butter
* Sour cream 
* Cheese

Some of the Napolact products have been certified by the: Cedra yoghurt, Nasal cheese, Tarnava cheese, Alpina cheese, Smoked Alpina cheese, Bobalna cheese, Dej cheese and Huedin telemea.
Likewise, Napolact had launched the product range as of April 2015 which contains milk, yoghurt, Sana and Kefir. These products come from 14 organic farms in Ardeal (which is just another name for Transylvania), sheltered from any sources of pollution. Special documentation proves that the resulted milk come from animals which have been raised in all-natural circumstances. This includes food which have no additives, antibiotics or any other type of chemicals.

==Prizes==
Since 1994, Napolact has received various distinctions and prizes awarded by the Romanian government because of the quality of their products. In 2003 they had been situated on the first place in the “food industry, large enterprises” category and had also received an eminence diploma at the 10th edition of “Topului National al Firmelor”.
In 2013, Napolact had been declared the most trusted brand in the dairy industry according to the “” case study done by “Reader’s Digest in Romania” magazine. The studies used only open-ended questions in which consumers were asked to enlist brands.

==Ţaga natural cave==
At Ţaga, Cluj County, in a natural cave from the Middle Ages, in microbiological conditions that are unique in the world. The rock of the cave and the Brevibacterium linens bacteria which developed in it, the constant temperature and humidity, act on the cheeses produced here.
