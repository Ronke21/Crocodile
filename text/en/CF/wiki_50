<text>Hazel Thereasa O&#x27;Connor (born 16 May 1954) is a British singer-songwriter and actress. She became famous in the early 1980s with hit singles &quot;Eighth Day&quot;, &quot;D-Days&quot; and &quot;Will You?&quot; She also starred in the 1980 film &quot;Breaking Glass&quot;.

==Career==
O&#x27;Connor was born in Coventry, England. She is the daughter of a soldier from Galway who settled in England after the Second World War to work in a car plant. Her brother Neil later fronted the punk band The Flys, best known for their single &quot;Love and a Molotov Cocktail&quot;, which she later covered.

Her film debut was in &quot;Girls Come First&quot; in 1975, where she was credited as Hazel Glyn. She became prominent as an actress and singer five years later in 1980 when playing the role of Kate in the film &quot;Breaking Glass&quot;. She also performed on the accompanying soundtrack.

Her performance as Kate won her the Variety Club of Great Britain Award for &#x27;Best Film Actress&#x27;. She was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music. The film&#x27;s soundtrack album featured songs written and performed by O&#x27;Connor and reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart. It had a 38-week chart run and was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry. Several tracks from the album were released as singles, the most successful being &quot;Eighth Day&quot; and &quot;Will You&quot; (with a notable saxophone solo by Wesley Magoogan) which both reached the UK Top 10. When O&#x27;Connor toured the UK to promote the album, the opening act were a then-unknown group called Duran Duran. It was the band&#x27;s first opportunity to play to large audiences throughout the UK and gave them the exposure they needed to secure a recording contract.

Subsequent albums released by O&#x27;Connor included &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (which featured the UK Top 10 hit single &quot;D-Days&quot;), &quot;Cover Plus&quot;, &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;Private Wars&quot; and &quot;Five in the Morning&quot;. O&#x27;Connor also collaborated with other artists, and made appearances in the video for Mick Karn&#x27;s &quot;The Sound Of Waves&quot; and a cameo appearance in the 1983 Eurythmics video &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot;.

O&#x27;Connor donated her songwriting talents to Greenpeace First International Record Project released worldwide in 1985 as a response to the French bombing and subsequent sinking of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;. Her duet song &quot;Push and Shove&quot; with Chris Thompson leads off the second act of the album and accompanying video.

She has made numerous television appearances, starring in &quot;Jangles&quot; on British television and in 1986 playing the lead role of Vivienne in &quot;Fighting Back&quot; as well as singing the theme tune. She also played a singer in an episode of &quot;Prospects&quot; on Channel 4 in 1986 alongside former &quot;Breaking Glass&quot; co-star Gary Olsen, resulting in the release of a spin-off single &quot;Today Could Be So Good&quot; . For a time she was interested in becoming a member of The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement, and starred in a 60-minute film about her relationship with the Krishnas titled &quot;Persuaders&quot; which was broadcast by the BBC in December 1985.

Her theatre work included &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, &quot;Nightshoot&quot; at the Tricycle Theatre, London, &quot;Girlfriends&quot; at the Playhouse, London, &quot;Swing Out Sister&quot;, her own production, at the Riverside Studio, London, &quot;The Raven Beckons&quot; at the Riverbank Theatre, Dublin and &quot;The Cuchulain Cycle&quot; at the Riverside Studio, London.

In 1997 she recorded the studio album &quot;Five in the Morning&quot; with record producer, co-writer and guitarist, Gerard Kiely. The album included the song &quot;Na Na Na&quot;. A live album, &quot;Live in Berlin&quot;, followed.

The turn of the century saw O&#x27;Connor tell her life story in a touring show entitled &quot;Beyond Breaking Glass&quot;, with harpist Cormac de Barra. The show was a hit at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1998 and toured Ireland and the UK, the Netherlands (twice), Australia and Canada.

She signed to Invisible Hands Music in 2002; this triggered a run of new releases and of deluxe re-issues of her 1990s work. A commercially available reincarnation of the previously mail-order &quot;Beyond the Breaking Glass&quot; was followed by a previously unreleased acoustic concert, &quot;Acoustically Yours&quot;.

In 2003, Invisible Hands Music released O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first-ever official best of compilation, &quot;A Singular Collection&quot;, which brought together her early hits from the Albion days, mid career work at RCA, and the best of the latter, DIY era. To add something new to the best of compilation, O&#x27;Connor recorded a cover of her friend George Michael&#x27;s hit &quot;One More Try&quot;, with a band that included drummer Carlos Hercules, who at the time was playing for Annie Lennox and Beverley Knight. Hercules joined George Michael&#x27;s band in 2006. The track was released as a single, and generated extensive airplay and renewed interest in O&#x27;Connor—the following year saw her perform at the Glastonbury Festival.

&quot;Hidden Heart&quot;, produced by Martin Rushent and including duets with Maire Brennan and Rob Reynolds, was released in the UK in 2006, and her 1984 album &quot;Smile&quot; was reissued on CD in 2008.

In 2008, O&#x27;Connor performed for the second time at the Glastonbury Festival, playing an acoustic set on the Avalon stage.

In 2009, O&#x27;Connor performed as part of the &#x27;1980s Here and Now&#x27; tour at many venues including Wembley Arena. She continued to tour extensively with her own solo projects, &#x27;Beyond the Breaking Glass&#x27; and &#x27;Bluja Project&#x27;. In 2009 she was awarded her own star on Coventry&#x27;s &#x27;Walk of Fame&#x27;.

In September 2010, O&#x27;Connor performed in France with The Bluja Project featuring Clare Hirst and Sarah Fisher, and in Ireland in October with Cormac de Barra. She then performed &#x27;Breaking Glass Live&#x27; throughout England, culminating in a show at the Leicester Square Theatre in London on 5 December 2010.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Connor married artist Kurt Bippert in 1987. The ceremony took place on Venice Beach, California. It received coverage by &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine. The actor David Rappaport was best man, and Dave Wakeling from The Beat gave O&#x27;Connor away. Bippert and O&#x27;Connor divorced in 2000.

She had previously dated Hugh Cornwell and Midge Ure.

O&#x27;Connor is a vegetarian.

O&#x27;Connor currently divides her time between living in Ireland and France. She is friends with BBC Radio London host JoAnne Good and singer Toyah Willcox, whom she narrowly beat for the lead role in &quot;Breaking Glass&quot;.

On 17 January 2022, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s brother Neil published a statement on her website, saying she was currently recovering from &quot;a serious medical event&quot; on 9 January 2022 at her house in France. She had been taken to hospital where it was determined that she had suffered a brain haemorrhage and was put into an induced coma for 24 hours.

<doc id="955685" wikidata="Q4742566" url="?curid=955685" title="America's Most Talented Kid">
<text>America&#x27;s Most Talented Kid is an American television series that premiered on NBC on March 28, 2003. In each round, three age groups (3–7, 8–12, 13–16) of talented children would perform songs, dance numbers, magic, and other forms of entertainment in front of head judge Lance Bass and other guest celebrity judges, such as Sisqo, Maureen McCormick, Jermaine Jackson and Daisy Fuentes. Host Mario Lopez led the highest scorer from each round until only three children were left to compete in the grand finale. In the end, Cheyenne Kimball was crowned the grand champion.

The final NBC episode featured senior citizens competing in the special &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Senior&quot;.

A limited-run series on NBC to compete with the growing talent-show trend in reality television, it would later move to PAX TV (which then had a business/content-sharing relationship with Paxson Communications), the title pluralized to &quot;Kids&quot;, with Dave Coulier as host and Daryl Sabara, Scarlett Pomers and Bobb&#x27;e J. Thompson as judges. Unlike the NBC version, however, each show would crown a $1,000 winner and give the winner a finale slot. The Grand Champion of this season was then 13-year-old rock violinist/singer/songwriter Antonio Pontarelli.

In 2004 &quot;American Idol&quot; runner-up Diana DeGarmo, 2007 &quot;American Idol&quot; winner Jordin Sparks, plus &quot;American Idol&quot; season 9 contestant Aaron Kelly appeared on the show. Singer Tori Kelly performed on the show during the PAX TV run and won, beating out singer and accordionist, Hunter Hayes.

==Notable contestants==
*Cheyenne Kimball – Grand Champion (2003); debut album &quot;The Day Has Come&quot; debuted at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States
*JoJo – singer
*Antonio Pontarelli – Grand Champion (2004)
*Tori Kelly – Singer, songwriter, and actress.

<doc id="955687" wikidata="Q7097708" url="?curid=955687" title="Operation Web Tryp">
<text>Operation Web Tryp was a United States Drug Enforcement Administration operation that ended on July 21, 2004 with the arrests of 10 persons. Its purpose was to investigate web sites suspected of distribution of unscheduled, unregulated tryptamines and phenethylamines of questionable legality. This trade in &quot;grey market&quot; drugs, which were not explicitly illegal but potentially prosecutable as drug analogs, became known as the &quot;research chemical&quot; trade; a euphemism to suggest that the chemicals were being sold for industrial or academic research rather than human consumption.

Five websites were involved in Operation Web Tryp. One of these websites, pondman.nu, was allegedly taking in U.S. $20,000 per week and grossed $700,000 before being shut down. Another, racresearch.com, reportedly grossed $500,000 in 14 months.

In 2005, a court ruled that AMT sold by pondman.nu caused the April 2002 death of an 18-year-old male in upstate New York and the site&#x27;s owner was sentenced to 410 years in prison. The DEA also alleged a product sold by &quot;americanchemicalsupply.com&quot; caused the death of a 22-year-old Louisiana man. Fourteen other non-fatal overdose incidents requiring hospitalization were also cited by the DEA.

In December 2004, using credit card information provided by the DEA, British police arrested 22 UK residents who had purchased 2C-I through the seized web sites (Operation Ismene). No one was jailed and most were released without charge. No customers in the United States were known to be arrested.

== Legality ==
Although these chemicals were not yet scheduled, a long shadow was cast on their legality by the 1986 Federal Analog Act. This Act and the &quot;United States v. Forbes&quot; Colorado federal district court case stipulated that the burden of proof, in regards for the intention for human consumption, was on the government if any prosecution under the Federal Analog Act was to occur. Additionally, legal ambiguities regarding the legality of certain analogs of scheduled substances had been established in the aforementioned court case (In particular, the similarities of AET and DMT were debated).

<text>The East Side Gallery () memorial in Berlin-Friedrichshain is a permanent open-air gallery on the longest surviving section of the Berlin Wall in Mühlenstraße between the Berlin Ostbahnhof and the along the Spree. It consists of a series of murals painted directly on a long remnant of the Berlin Wall, located near the centre of Berlin, on Mühlenstraße in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.

In the spring of 1990, after the opening of the Berlin Wall, this section was painted by 118 artists from 21 countries. The artists commented on the political changes of 1989/90 in a good hundred paintings on the side of the Wall that was formerly facing East Berlin. Due to urban development measures, it is no longer completely preserved, and instead of the originals from then, only the replicas from 2009 exist today.

The actual border at this point was the Kreuzberg bank of the Spree. The gallery is, for the most part, located on the western wall, which closed off the border area to East Berlin. This wall, facing inwards towards West Berlin, was much thicker and more fortified than its outward-facing counterpart. However, a small portion of the so-called &quot;hinterland&quot; wall has managed to survive, despite its weaker structure, as part of the memorial. Mühlenstrasse, one of the main arterial roads to the south, ran along these border installations. Due to the spatial conditions, the previously usual concrete pipes were already installed here, so that the interior wall in this area was atypically optically, but somewhat elevated, resembling the outer wall.

The gallery has official status as a &quot;&quot;, or heritage-protected landmark. According to the &quot;Künstlerinitiative East Side Gallery e.V.&quot;, an association of the artists involved in the project, &quot;The East Side Gallery is understood as a monument to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the peaceful negotiation of borders and conventions between societies and people&quot;, and has more than three million visitors per year.

==Description==
The Gallery consists of 105 paintings by artists from all over the world, painted in 1990 on the east side of the Berlin Wall. The actual border at this point had been the river Spree. The gallery is located on the so-called &quot;hinterland mauer&quot;, which closed the border to West Berlin.

It is possibly the largest and longest-lasting open air gallery in the world. Paintings from Jürgen Grosse alias INDIANO, Dimitri Vrubel, Siegfrid Santoni, Bodo Sperling, Kasra Alavi, Kani Alavi, Jim Avignon, Thierry Noir, Ingeborg Blumenthal, Ignasi Blanch i Gisbert, Kim Prisu, 
Hervé Morlay VR and others have followed.

The paintings at the East Side Gallery document a time of change and express the euphoria and great hopes for a better, more free future for all people of the world.

The East Side Gallery was founded following the successful merger of the two German artists&#x27; associations VBK and BBK. The founding members were the speche of the Federal Association of Artists BBK Bodo Sperling, Barbara Greul Aschanta, Jörg Kubitzki and David Monti.

In July 2006, to facilitate access to the river Spree from the Mercedes-Benz Arena, a section was moved somewhat west, parallel to the original position.

A 23-meter (75&#x27;) section was scheduled to be removed on 1 March 2013 to make way for luxury apartments. None of the artists whose work will be destroyed were informed of these plans. The demolition work actually started on 1 March 2013. According to German news FOCUS, authorities were not aware of the start of the demolition. Due to the involvement of protesters, demolition was postponed until at least 18 March 2013.

==Renovation==
Two-thirds of the paintings are badly damaged by erosion, graffiti, and vandalism. One-third have been restored by a non-profit organization which started work in 2000. The objective of this organization is the eventual restoration and preservation of all the paintings. Full restoration, particularly of the central sections, was projected for 2008. Remediation began in May 2009.

The restoration process has been marked by major conflict. Eight of the artists of 1990 refused to paint their own images again after they were completely destroyed by the renovation. In order to defend the copyright, they founded &quot;Founder Initiative East Side&quot; with other artists whose images were copied without permission.
Bodo Sperling launched a test case in the Berlin State Court in May 2011, represented by the Munich art lawyer Hannes Hartung and with the support of the German VG Bild-Kunst. The Court will address the question of whether art should be listed as destroyed and then re-copied without the respective artists&#x27; permission. The outcome of the trial will be a landmark declaration for European art law.

== Future of the East Side Gallery ==
As of 1 November 2018, the State of Berlin will be responsible for the &quot;Park an der Spree&quot; and &quot;East Side Park&quot; plots with the elements of the former Berlin Wall known as the &quot;East Side Gallery&quot; from the property of the State of Berlin in the Transfer of ownership to the Berlin Wall Foundation. Parliament approved a proposal from the Senator for Culture and Europe that had passed the main committee. The Berlin Wall Foundation received the mandate for the structural maintenance of the East Side Gallery monument, the maintenance of the associated public green space and the mediation of the historical site of remembrance.

In the future, visitors to the East Side Gallery should receive more information and historical classification. For this purpose, the foundation has launched an extensive management program. The aim of all new mediation offers is to illustrate the unique dual character of the historical place: On the one hand, as an artistic testimony and symbol of joy over the peaceful overcoming of the German division; as a testimony to the GDR border regime on the other hand. Both narratives need to be related in a common narrative.

<text>A service flag or service banner is a banner that family members of those serving in the United States Armed Forces can display. The flag or banner is officially defined as a white field with a red border, with a blue star for each family member serving in the Armed Forces of the United States during any period of war or hostilities. A gold star (with a blue edge) represents a family member who died during military operations, including those who died during World War I, World War II, or any subsequent period of armed hostilities in which the United States was engaged before July 1, 1958, and those who lost or lose their lives after June 30, 1958:
# while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;
# while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or
# while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict in which the United States is not a belligerent party against an opposing armed force; 

or those who lost or lose their lives after March 28, 1973, as a result of:
# an international terrorist attack against the United States or a foreign nation friendly to the United States, recognized as such an attack by the Secretary of Defense; or
# military operations while serving outside the United States (including the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States) as part of a peacekeeping force. 

==Background==
Based on the star symbols used on the service flag, the term &quot;Blue Star&quot; has come into use in the United States as a reference to having a family member in active military service, while the term &quot;Gold Star&quot; has come to refer to the loss of a family member in military service. For example, the mother of a person who died in service is referred to as a &quot;Gold Star mother&quot;, and the wife of an active service member is referred to as a &quot;Blue Star wife&quot;. Charitable support organizations have been established for Gold Star mothers, Gold Star wives, Blue Star mothers, and Blue Star wives. The last Sunday in September is observed as Gold Star Mother&#x27;s Day, Gold Star family members are entitled to wear a Gold Star Lapel Button, and all 50 U.S. states and Guam offer some form of a specialty license plate for motor vehicles owned by Gold Star family members.

The use of the terms has sometimes been restricted to refer to service during specific armed conflicts. For example, the service banner originally applied only to World War I, and it was later expanded to include service in World War II, then the Korean War, then other specific conflicts, and then &quot;any period of war or hostilities&quot;. In some current uses of the &quot;star&quot; terminology, there is no longer any distinction made about the place or time or degree of hostility involved in the military service. For Gold Stars, the Department of Defense also makes a distinction about the manner and place of death, but some other organizations do not. The Gold Star term is also sometimes interpreted to apply to those missing in action and those who did not die during active service but died later as a result of an in-service injury.

A lesser-known practice of using a silver star to indicate a service member that has been disabled is sometimes also followed, although this practice is not recognized in federal law.

==History==

The banner was designed in 1917 by U.S. Army Captain Robert L. Queisser of the Fifth Ohio Infantry, in honor of his two sons who were serving in World War I. It was quickly adopted by the public and by government officials. On September 24, 1917, an Ohio congressman read into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;:

The mayor of Cleveland, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Governor of Ohio have adopted this service flag. The world should know of those who give so much for liberty. The dearest thing in all the world to a father and mother—their children.

The United Service Flag Company in Cleveland, Ohio ran an advertisement in the October 1917 issue of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; for service flags and pins, reading:

THE AUTHORIZED SERVICE FLAG
SHOULD BE FLOWN FROM EVERY HOME

Do as Col. Roosevelt does at Oyster Bay - fly the &quot;Badge of Honor&quot; from your home, telling all the world that some one from your family is serving the country in army, navy, marines, or other service. This is the original flag so crudely imitated. Approved by War Secretary Baker. Bill in Congress to make it official emblem. Fast-color, strong, wool bunting, 36 x 24 inches; red border, white field; one large blue star for every man in service; sewed throughout, not printed. Sent postpaid for $2 - 1 to 5 stars. (Larger sizes for clubs, churches, business houses, etc., made to order.) SERVICE FLAG PINS to wear in lapel or waist, 14k. gold plate and enamel, 1 to 3 stars, pin or screw back, high-grade quality, 50 cents; sterling silver; $1; solid gold, $2.

The United Service Flag Co., 1255 Schofield Bldg., Cleveland, O.
==Usage==

These flags were first used in World War I, with subsequent standardization and codification by the end of World War II. They were not popular during the Vietnam War, but have come back into use since the first Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm. In modern usage, an organization may fly a service flag if one of its members is serving active duty.

Manufacture of these flags is only allowed by specific government license in the territories under U.S. jurisdiction. The same section of the United States Code that limits manufacture of the banner also mentions lapel pins. There is no legal specification of the banner&#x27;s size, but according to the DoD code, the flag size ratio must be 10:19, the same as the Flag of the United States. When displayed with the national flag, the latter should take the place of honor. If the flags displayed differ in size, the national flag should be larger.

Blue and gold are the only colors specified for use, but silver stars are increasingly in use to represent those discharged from service because of wounds or being invalided home. The Silver Star Families of America is an organization attempting to encourage the U.S. Congress to make the Silver Star Service Banner official for those wounded or injured in a war zone. Forty-nine states, Guam, Saipan, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Chickasaw Nation and over 2,700 cities and counties have issued proclamations in support of the Silver Star Banner and of Silver Star Service Banner Day on May 1 of every year.

On April 21, 2010, the United States House of Representatives passed House Resolution 855, a stand-alone resolution recognizing the Silver Star Service Banner and making May 1 Silver Star Service Banner Day. One state, Missouri, took steps to make such recognition a state law.

In World War II, the Brazilian &quot;Clube Militar&quot; (Military Club) and the &quot;Casino da Urca&quot; adopted the concepts of the U.S. service banner by giving posters to the family members of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. On these posters the phrase &quot;Daqui saiu um Expedicionário&quot; was written, which means &quot;From here came an Expeditionary&quot;. Although the design differs from the U.S. banners, the mothers of the Brazilian soldiers also received a pin prominently featuring a blue star similar to U.S. pins.

==Individuals entitled to display==
The individuals entitled to display the service flag are officially defined in which reads:

A service flag approved by the Secretary of Defense may be displayed in a window of the place of residence of individuals who are members of the immediate family of an individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United States during any period of war or hostilities in which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged.

The U.S. Code also discusses the wearing of lapel pins.

==Gold Star Mother&#x27;s Day==

On the last Sunday in September, Gold Star Mother&#x27;s Day is observed in the U.S. in honor of Gold Star mothers, as established in Title 36 § 111 of the United States Code. This was originally declared by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936.

In 2009, Barack Obama proclaimed the observance as Gold Star Mother&#x27;s and Families&#x27; Day. Since 2011 it has been proclaimed as Gold Star Mother&#x27;s and Family&#x27;s Day.

==Gold Star license plates==
All fifty U.S. states and Guam offer some form of a specialty license plate for motor vehicles owned by members of Gold Star families.

<text>The Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) was a research group at the University of California, Berkeley, that was dedicated to enhancing AT&amp;T Unix operating system and funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

==History==

Professor Bob Fabry of Berkeley acquired a UNIX source license from AT&amp;T in 1974. His group started to modify UNIX, and distributed their version as the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). In April 1980, Fabry signed a contract with DARPA to develop UNIX even further and accommodate the specific requirements of the ARPAnet. With this funding, Fabry created the Computer Systems Research Group.

The Berkeley Sockets API and Berkeley Fast File System are some of the group&#x27;s most significant innovations. The sockets interface solved the problem of supporting multiple protocols (e.g. XNS and TCP/IP), and extended UNIX&#x27;s &quot;everything is a file&quot; notion to these network protocols, while the Fast File System increased the block allocation size from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes (or larger), improving disk transfer performance, while also allowing &quot;micro-blocks&quot; as small as 128 bytes, which improved disk use. Another noteworthy contribution was job control signals, which allowed a user to suspend a job with a key-press (control-Z), and then continue running the job in the background under the C shell.

Noteworthy versions of BSD were 3.0 BSD (the first version of BSD to support virtual memory), 4.0 BSD (which included the job-control CTRL-Z functionality, to suspend and restart a running job), a special 4.15 (interim) BSD version which had been released using BBN&#x27;s TCP/IP, and 4.2 BSD (which included a full TCP/IP stack, FFS, and NFS support.)

By the early 1980s, CSRG was the best-known non-commercial Unix developer, and a majority of Unix sites used at least some Berkeley software. AT&amp;T included some CSRG work in Unix System V. During the 1970s and 1980s, AT&amp;T/USL raised the commercial licensing fee for UNIX from $20,000 to $100,000–$200,000. This became a big problem for small research labs and companies who used BSD, and the CSRG decided to replace all the source code that originated from AT&amp;T. They succeeded in 1994, but AT&amp;T disagreed and sued Berkeley. After a court settlement in 1994, CSRG distributed the final version of BSD, called 4.4BSD-Lite2.

The group was disbanded in 1995, leaving a significant legacy: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD are based on the 4.4BSD-Lite distribution and continue to play an important role in the open-source UNIX community today, including dictating the style of C programming used via KNF in the style man page.

Alongside the Free Software Foundation and Linux, the CSRG laid the foundations of the open source community.

Former members include Keith Bostic, Bill Joy, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Samuel J. Leffler, Özalp Babaoğlu and Michael J. Karels, among others. The corporations Sun Microsystems, Berkeley Software Design and Sleepycat Software (later acquired by Oracle) can be considered spin-off companies of CSRG. Berkeley Software Design was led by Robert Kolstad, who led the development of BSD Unix for supercomputers at Convex Computer.

<doc id="955701" wikidata="Q1130271" url="?curid=955701" title="Lionel Luthor">
<text>Lionel Luthor is a fictional character portrayed by John Glover in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. The character was initially a special guest in season one, and became a series regular in season two and continued until being written out of the show in season seven. The character returned to the show in season ten again in a special guest role as a parallel universe (Earth-2) version of the character. In &quot;Smallville&quot;, Lionel Luthor is the father of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), and founder and CEO of LuthorCorp. Lex Luthor&#x27;s father was first introduced in &quot;Superman&quot; comics by Jerry Siegel in 1961 and has since appeared in other Superman-related media under different names. &quot;Smallville&quot; is the first appearance in which the character has been an intricate part of a Superman adaptation. Series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar created Lionel Luthor for &quot;Smallville&quot; to provide an antithesis to the parenting style of Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) and Martha Kent (Annette O&#x27;Toole). In the DC Comics, Lex Luthor&#x27;s father was originally named Jules Luthor, but later was renamed Lionel Luthor some time after &quot;Smallville&quot;. He debuted in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girlfriend, Lois Lane&quot; #23 (February 1961) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Kurt Schaffenberger.

During the story of &quot;Smallville&quot;, Lionel evolves from being a nemesis of Clark Kent (Tom Welling) who develops multiple schemes to uncover Clark&#x27;s secrets, to becoming an ally who eventually dies to protect Clark&#x27;s secret from his own son. Lionel has a strained relationship with Lex and regularly tries to test him. He attempts to develop a romantic relationship with Martha Kent following the death of Jonathan Kent, helping her advance toward the United States Senate. A parallel universe version of the character is later introduced in the show&#x27;s final season, who serves as Clark and his allies&#x27; adversary and plays a pivotal role in bringing Lex back from his presumed death.

Lionel&#x27;s development from a main antagonist to an ally was difficult for the writers, who felt the character&#x27;s arc failed to achieve the status they wanted. Although they continued with the story arc, Lionel returned to using deception to protect Clark rather than exploit him. He is characterized as a sinister character who tried hard to further his own ambitions. Lionel&#x27;s relationship with his son has been likened to that of Harry Osborn and Norman Osborn from Spider-Man comics.

==Role in &quot;Smallville&quot;==
In 1989, Lionel visits Smallville to buy the Ross Creamed Corn company immediately before a meteor shower occurs. Twelve years later during season one, Lionel exiles his son Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to Smallville to run LuthorCorp&#x27;s local fertilizer plant as a test. When Lex makes a profit for the first time in years, Lionel closes the plant and blames Lex&#x27;s poor managerial skills. Lionel later confronts his son at the Luthor mansion when Lex tries to orchestrate an employee buyout to save the fertilizer plant. When strong winds force debris to smash through the mansion, Lionel is pinned under a fallen support beam and Lex hesitates to save his father. In season two, Lex saves Lionel but loses his sight because of Lex&#x27;s judgment to rush into surgery. Lionel is initially shown as blind. Lex and Lucas Luthor (Paul Wasilewski)—Lionel&#x27;s illegitimate son—devise a plan to uncover Lionel&#x27;s deception; it is revealed that Lionel was blind but that his eyes healed and he intentionally neglected to tell anyone so he could watch how they acted around him. Lionel is later aware of the Kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mysterious symbols there, to the dismay of Clark Kent (Tom Welling). Season three revealed that Lionel conspired with Morgan Edge (Rutger Hauer) to murder Lionel&#x27;s parents and use the insurance money to fund LuthorCorp. Lionel has Lex committed to a mental institution, when his son discovers what Lionel did. When Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) discovers the truth, that evidence is used to assist Lex have Lionel arrested for his parents&#x27; murder. It is also revealed why Lionel is angry with Lex; he blames his son for the death of his youngest son Julian Luthor, although Lex took the blame to protect the true killer: Lillian (Alisen Down), Lionel&#x27;s mentally unwell wife. Lionel also learns that he has a terminal liver disease, which he divulges to Lex while awaiting arraignment.

Lionel is sentenced to prison for his parents&#x27; murder in season four. Lionel attempts to switch bodies with Lex using a stone from Clark&#x27;s homeworld of Krypton but Clark intervenes and Lionel switches bodies with Clark instead. When he and Clark switch back, Lionel discovers his terminal liver disease is healed. Lionel is released from prison by Genevieve Teague (Jane Seymour), and begins searching for three stones of knowledge. During this quest, Lionel falls into a catatonic state after being uploaded with Kryptonian knowledge. Lionel recovers in season five when the Kryptonian artificial intelligence Jor-El takes over his body to speak with Clark. With Jor-El guiding him, Lionel begins helping Clark by making excuses for Clark&#x27;s behavior and unexplained disappearances throughout seasons five and six. Season seven revealed that Lionel and three other wealthy families formed the secret society Veritas to protect an alien visitor known as the Traveler (Clark). Lex realized Lionel has been covering up the Traveler&#x27;s existence and murders his father. Season ten reveals that Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) is Lionel&#x27;s illegitimate daughter fathered with Pamela Jenkins (Donna Bullock).

Season ten featured an alternate doppelgänger of the character when Clark unintentionally visits a parallel universe where Lionel found and adopted Clark&#x27;s doppelgänger to be a murderer going by the alias of Ultraman before escaping back to his own reality but is followed by Lionel. Lionel posed as his own doppelgänger as he assumes control of LuthorCorp from Tess and attempts twice to groom &quot;Alexander Luthor&quot;/Conner Kent (Lucas Grabeel) to his side. However, Lionel fails to bring the hybrid clone of Clark and Lex to his side and loses the company when Tess proves he&#x27;s an imposter. The series finale revealed that Lionel discovers a clone of Lex, created from the pieces of others, hidden away. He founded the genetic research company PreClox as he embezzled a large amount of money from LuthorCorp to assist Lex&#x27;s scientists. A compatible heart could not be found among Lex&#x27;s replicates and Lionel tries to give Tess&#x27;s heart to Lex but Tess shoots Lionel and escapes. Lionel then surrenders his soul to Darkseid, giving Lionel&#x27;s heart to effectively resurrecting Lex. Afterwards, Darkseid possesses Lionel&#x27;s corpse to attack Clark who destroys Lionel&#x27;s body, dispelling Darkseid&#x27;s threat.

==Portrayal==
Lionel Luthor was created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar specifically for &quot;Smallville&quot; to provide a parallel to the Kents as an &quot;experiment in extreme parenting&quot;. The character Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) was also created for the show. Lex&#x27;s father has previously been depicted in other media.

Lionel Luthor is portrayed in the program by John Glover; Glover said he appreciates the &quot;clear canvas&quot; he had to work with when developing his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time. When portraying the character&#x27;s struggle with terminal liver disease, Glover was inspired by a friend&#x27;s battle with cancer; he said his friend was a &quot;cheerleader to people&quot;, who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad. When Glover&#x27;s friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it, but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later. This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide—which Lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal.

==Character development==
===Storyline progression===
In season two, Lionel moves from being recurring figure to a regular character. This season features the gradual unveiling of Lionel&#x27;s increasing involvement with the characters of the show. It begins with more direct involvement when Luthor hires Martha Kent as his assistant, and then indirectly when he becomes the conservator of the Kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mystery of the symbols on the cave walls. During season three, Lionel becomes the villain of the show when he tries to discover Clark&#x27;s secret and drives Lex into a psychotic breakdown. This allows Lionel to use electroshock therapy on Lex to erase his knowledge of Lionel&#x27;s co-opting of Morgan Edge to kill Lionel&#x27;s parents for their life insurance. The creative team experimented with Lionel&#x27;s character in season four, creating a storyline in which Lionel is reformed. Executive producer Greg Beeman said the character development failed, and as a result Lionel returned to his normal self. John Glover found playing Lionel as a straight arrow was &quot;boring&quot;.

Season five explores the relationship between Martha and Lionel. Both Annette O&#x27;Toole and Al Gough said Lionel was slightly attracted to Martha, but that she would never act on that feeling. The producers had no intentions to create a romantic relationship between the two characters. Most of Lionel&#x27;s motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery. Glover said he could not determine whether his character is good or bad, so when he is portraying him in season five he tried to present everything as if it was &quot;good&quot;. Glover said he believes Lincoln Cole&#x27;s (Ian Tracey) actions in &quot;Mercy&quot; made Lionel rethink everything his past behavior and his own character. By the end of the fifth season, Lionel has learned that people have a responsibility to each other.

&quot;Smallville&quot; writer and executive producer Brian Peterson said the creative team wanted to remind the audience that Lionel was still the same Lionel Luthor they had come know, so they delayed revealing Lionel&#x27;s usual antics until season six&#x27;s &quot;Promise&quot; in which he blackmails Lana into marrying Lex. Peterson wanted to &quot;slap [the audience] in the face&quot; with a reminder of Lionel&#x27;s former character. Although Lionel blackmails Lana into marrying Lex, John Glover said Lionel was trying to protect Clark, for which he needed Lana&#x27;s help. By the time season six began airing, John Glover realized Lex was starting to become more villainous and that his time on the show would be limited. Glover hoped Lionel would still be able to influence his son as the show progressed; he believed his character would be useless on the show without such influencing abilities. Glover said the conflict between Lex and his father is very positive for the show because Lionel&#x27;s attempt to bond with Lex and the distrust between them &quot;makes drama&quot;.

===Characterization===
John Glover characterizes Lionel as a businessman who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this &quot;rich and powerful businessman&quot; who sees his son as a &quot;wuss&quot; and &quot;fraidy-cat&quot;. It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover said he does not want to simply &quot;twirl [his] mustache&quot;. Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people&#x27;s defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel&#x27;s character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the &quot;sinister&quot; nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or &quot;clinical blue&quot; background. Lionel&#x27;s signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash.

===Relationships===
The relationship between Lionel and his son Lex is strained; it has been likened to the relationship between Norman and Harry Osborn in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film. Glover tried to make Lionel appear as though he is trying to &quot;toughen [Lex] up&quot;. The character is made to &quot;go out of his way, to give [Lex] tests, so [Lex] can prove himself&quot;. Glover sees the character as a rich and powerful businessman who is disappointed in his son. Glover&#x27;s goal for season one was to show Lionel&#x27;s attempts to make Lex tougher; he interprets the character&#x27;s motto in his raising of Lex as &quot;no risk, no rewards&quot;.
Glover believes Lionel has two competing agendas with Lex—for Lex to become his own man and for Lex to follow in his father&#x27;s steps. This becomes frustrating for Lex because Lionel wants his son to be both &quot;loyal follower&quot; and the &quot;best person he can be&quot;. This all plays into Lionel&#x27;s &quot;pretty huge ego&quot;. John Glover believes if Lionel and Lex were not related Lionel would have &quot;destroyed&quot; Lex early on because he views his son as &quot;weak&quot;. Lionel is also bound by the fact that Lex is his heir, although he does not trust Lex. Lionel&#x27;s distrust of Lex partially arises because he believes Lex is a coward. John Glover said: &quot;It&#x27;s not that Lionel is meant to be a foe; it&#x27;s just that the poor boy&#x27;s weak, so Lionel must mold him. Lionel is continually trying to strengthen his son, to teach him. Lex is just a hard student&quot;.

Lionel also has a key relationship with Martha Kent, Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel&#x27;s attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha&#x27;s &quot;goodness&quot; and the attraction is not based on lust. When Lionel is in Martha&#x27;s company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex&#x27;s relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O&#x27;Toole said Martha&#x27;s interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal: &quot;It&#x27;s that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can&#x27;t stop watching it, but at the same time you feel, &#x27;Oh my God, he&#x27;s going to kill me&#x27;&quot;. O&#x27;Toole also said she believes Martha&#x27;s motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character &quot;more of a send-off&quot; than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O&#x27;Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.

Glover believes Martha influenced Lionel to start believing that sacrifice is necessary to make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O&#x27;Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O&#x27;Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.

===Reception===
For his portrayal of Lionel Luthor on &quot;Smallville&quot;, John Glover was nominated for two Saturn Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series. The first came in 2003, following his upgrade to series regular status, and the second in 2004. By season four, one reviewer said Lionel should have left the show after succumbing to his terminal liver disease in season three. Maurice Cobbs of DVD Verdict said Lionel was taking away from the primary characters&#x27; screen time in season four, and the producers should have killed him at the end of season three.

==&quot;Smallville&quot; tie-ins==
===Novels===
Lionel makes his first appearance outside the television series in the Aspect book &quot;Smallville: Strange Visitors&quot;. In this title, Lionel is concerned that confidence trickster Donald Jacobi will draw too much attention to the meteor rocks in Smallville and ruin his plans to use the rocks for experiments. Lionel has the life of Jacobi&#x27;s partner put in jeopardy when he threatens to alert some mobsters who are looking for Lionel. He makes a brief appearance in &quot;Smallville: Dragon&quot;, in which he tells Lex he used Lex&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Renata to get close to Lex to test him for unknown reasons.

==In other media==
===Film=== 
* In Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; and Bryan Singer&#x27;s &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, Lex briefly mentions his father—but not his father&#x27;s name—as the inspiration of Lex&#x27;s real estate schemes. Lex also says that his father was a harsh man who ejected him from the family home. 

* In Zack Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, Lex is named after his father, Alexander Luthor Sr., the founder of LexCorp and an oil and machinery tycoon immigrant from East Germany who died in 2000. When confronting Superman, Lex mentions his father&#x27;s abusive behavior in his childhood. A newspaper article in the film erroneously refers to him as Lionel Luther, like in &quot;Smallville&quot;, though it is unknown if this was a mistake or an intentional nod to &quot;Smallville&quot;.

===Television===
* In the 1988–1992 television series &quot;Superboy&quot;, Lex&#x27;s father appears in season four&#x27;s &quot;Know Thine Enemy&quot; (Part 1), in which Superboy becomes Lex Luthor in a virtual reality and watches Lex grow up with an abusive father; Lex&#x27;s father is unnamed and is portrayed by Edgar Allan Poe IV.

* Lionel Luthor appears in a flashback of the &quot;Supergirl&quot; episode &quot;Luthors&quot;, portrayed by Ian Butcher. He is a billionaire and the founder of his family&#x27;s company LuthorCorp as well as resembling the future Lex Luthor (Jon Cryer) with his baldness. It is revealed that sometime after marrying Lillian (Brenda Strong) and having Lex, Lionel began an affair with a woman named Elizabeth Walsh that would lead to the conception of Lena Luthor (Katie McGrath). Once Lillian discovered the affair, he ultimately chooses to remain with his family. After the death of Lena&#x27;s mother, Lionel takes in his illegitimate daughter but lies to her and the public that his second child is adopted. Lionel favors Lena over Lex due to his love for her mother, leading to tension with his wife and son, especially due to his emotional distance from Lex growing up. Lionel also became an alcoholic later in his life, contributing to his family&#x27;s dysfunction. Lionel died sometime afterwards due to unknown circumstances and Lex inherited his father&#x27;s fortune to lead LuthorCorp for years until his imprisonment. Lena then takes over leadership of LuthorCorp, relocates the company&#x27;s headquarters from Metropolis to National City, and renames it L-Corp, attempting to redeem her family name from Lex&#x27;s actions. When Lena learns her true paternity from Lillian, she becomes determined to restore the Luthor name for both her father and herself.

* Lionel Luthor appears in the &quot;Titans&quot; episode &quot;Conner&quot;, portrayed by Peter MacNeill. This version is almost blind and a former scientist.

Conner works to protect Lionel from the Cadmus team after he gets attacked by one of the soldiers. The next day, Mercy gives Lex a status report while also mentioning that his father is doing alright.

===In comics===
* Before &quot;Smallville&quot;, Lex&#x27;s father either made brief appearances in the &quot;Superman&quot; comics or was mentioned. Lex&#x27;s father first appears in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; #23 (1961), in the story &quot;The Curse of Lena Thorul!&quot;, written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel. In this story, he is named Jules, has disowned his criminal son Lex, and changed the family name to &quot;Thorul&quot;. Jules Thorul and his wife Arlene are later killed in a car accident. 

* In the 1989 graphic novel &quot;Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography&quot;, Lex&#x27;s unnamed father was an alcoholic who lived in the Suicide Slums of Metropolis with his wife and son Lex and regularly abused them. Later, it is revealed and implied that Lex had him killed for his insurance money which then helped him to create LuthorCorp, similar to Lionel Luthor&#x27;s origin story in &quot;Smallville&quot; in which he pulled the same scheme on his parents.

* In the 2004 miniseries &quot;&quot;, Lex&#x27;s father is not a billionaire but immediately puts Lex to work making millions for him after he discovers his son&#x27;s astronomical IQ.

* In the 2007 &quot;Booster Gold&quot; comic book series, an alternate timeline version of Lionel Luthor appears in which he is a travelling salesman who adopts a baby Kal-El and raises him as his own son, favoring him over Lex. After Lionel&#x27;s death, Lex finds out that his brother has superpowers and kills him in a fit of rage and jealousy.

* In &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; (2009), Lionel Luthor is briefly seen in his Smallville farmhouse having a volatile argument with a teenage Lex about the way he treated his wife and Lex&#x27;s mother and what Lex did to his sister Lena.

* In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #6 (March 2010), Lex&#x27;s father (not named) terrorizes Lex and Lena. He dies of a heart attack, leaving Lena in the care of an aunt and causes Lex to leave Smallville. It is later revealed that Lex had caused his father&#x27;s heart attack to cash in a sizable life insurance policy, which he would use as the basis for his fortune, the same plot Lionel used on his own parents in the &quot;Smallville&quot; backstory and what Lex himself used on his parents in &quot;Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography&quot;. 

* In &quot;Blackest Night&quot; #6, Lionel Luthor is revived as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. 

* Lionel Luthor appears with Lex Luthor in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; reality where they tour General Sam Lane&#x27;s facility of aliens.

<doc id="955702" wikidata="Q1498175" url="?curid=955702" title="Doftana prison">
<text>Doftana was a Romanian prison, sometimes referred to as &quot;the Romanian Bastille&quot;. Built in 1895 in connection with the nearby salt mines, from 1921 it began to be used to detain political prisoners, among them Max Goldstein, a revolutionary whose detonation of an explosive device in the Romanian Senate chamber in December 1920 prompted widespread suppression and detention of political radicals, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who was later the Prime Minister of Romania (1952–1955), and the Chairman of the State Council of Romania (1961–1965), and Nicolae Ceaușescu, who went on to be General Secretary of Romanian Communist Party (1965–1989), and the first President of Romania (1974–1989).

The prison is situated close to the village with the same name, in the Telega commune of Prahova County.

==Newspapers &amp; Museums==

From 1924 it is noted that the inmates began to write and edit a newspaper by hand using paper slips and smuggled pencils. It went by various names such as &quot;Doftana Red&quot; and &quot;Bolsheviks Handcuffed&quot;.

During the communist period of Romania just after World War II, it was transformed into a museum, which has since been deserted due to lack of funds.. The composer Alfred Mendelssohn wrote The Destruction of Doftanas, a symphonic poem about it.

Not only Romanian communists were imprisoned here, also captured German and Soviet soldiers and Hungarian civilians.

<doc id="955712" wikidata="Q1973302" url="?curid=955712" title="Necromunda">
<text>Necromunda is a skirmish tabletop war game produced by Games Workshop since 1995. It has been relaunched as Necromunda: Underhive in 2017. In &quot;Necromunda&quot;, players control rival gangs battling each other in the Underhive, a place of anarchy and violence in the depths below the Hive City. As in its parent game &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, &quot;Necromunda&quot; uses 28 mm miniatures (approximately 1:56) and terrain (in this case, the Underhive – a heavily polluted, underground industrial environment).

Necromunda allows players to develop their gangs between battles, gaining experience, gaining and losing new members or equipment, according to a set of rules. Gangs that frequently win games acquire more credits (money) and fewer injuries and so are able to grow throughout a campaign.

&quot;Necromunda&quot; also stands out by having a more three-dimensional table layout, with buildings generally having multiple floors, interconnecting walkways, and bridges. The terrain is constructed to simulate a hive city on the planet Necromunda, a dystopian futuristic city resembling a termite mound many miles high.

== Game setting ==
In the game of &quot;Necromunda&quot;, the eponymous setting is a world covered in polluted ash wastes, the result of thousands of years of heavy industry with no kinds of environmental safeguards whatsoever. Scattered amidst these seas of effluent and unstable continents of compacted dross and ash are between six and nine (the source material is inconsistent) &quot;hive cities&quot;. These are massive man-made structures, reminiscent of termite mounds on a staggering scale. So large that they break through the upper atmosphere and can serve as tethering points for starships, the hive cities are described as housing over a trillion people each.

This purpose of a &quot;hive world&quot; like Necromunda, is to be a manufacturing centre to provide equipment for the boundless legions of the Imperial Guard and Space Marines, as well as lay down new hulls for the Imperial Navy. The hive cities produce billions of tons of manufactured goods daily. In return for these services, the hives are described as being supplied with billions of tons of food and raw ore every day, serviced by bevies of ships that make commutes between the hive world and neighbouring planets that are mining or agricultural worlds.

=== Houses of Hive Primus ===
In the game the population of the hive city is divided into several &#x27;houses&#x27; of genetically distinct people, who apparently do not mix or interbreed, they serve as the various factions for the players to control to play the game. The houses are described as such:

====Orlock====
House Orlock is known as the House of Iron because its foundations lie upon deep ferrous slag pits. This massive resource has led to the largest profession in the house being miners. While not only iron miners, this is their largest export. They have an exclusive contract with House Ulanti (Mad Donna&#x27;s House) for the export of raw materials that they took from House Delaque through questionable means.

The structure of the House is significantly different due to its size. No single rule, but rather groups of families ally to form power structures within Orlock. A figurehead is maintained to make relations with other houses easier and has the secondary effect of keeping House Orlock strong despite its fractious nature. Something of a microcosm of Hive Primus in general. Not only because of its size, but because it is centrally located, Orlock borders all other houses. Along with marriages, most notably the current Lady Ko&#x27;Iron, House Orlock is ideally situated for trade with all other houses. Even Escher has respect for Orlock due to how much power women wield in the house. The notable exception to these good relations is House Delaque who are bitter over the loss of the Ulanti Contract, but they only share a mile-long border. This rivalry makes the employ of Seek and Destroy to Nemo particularly odd.

Due to their familial structure, gangs are usually an extension of that. Gangs members tend to be older and are more likely to be female than most other houses because they are frequently families themselves. This makes gangs better organised and more willing to work with other Orlock gangs than other houses. The downside to this familial bond is when there are Orlock rivalries they are much more bloody than in other houses. As is probably true of most gangs, they are not averse to slaving if the money is right Cardinal Crimson and their garb tends to be classic biker look. Official models and artwork.

From a player perspective, Orlock is considered the &quot;default&quot; house with no notable strengths or weaknesses, with their gangers getting access to Combat, Ferocity, and Shooting skills.

====Cawdor====
House Cawdor is the stronghold of the Cult of Redemption. For this reason, all of the gangers wear masks in public to hide their faces from the &#x27;infidels&#x27; of the other houses, and are known to utilise scavenged equipment due to their background as bone pickers and scavengers. They are known to hunt mutants and heretics to the point of fanaticism (part of the Redemptionist influence) which brings them into conflict with gangs who would utilise them.

From a player perspective House Cawdor is a fast-moving close combat house with the gangsters having access to Combat, Ferocity, and Agility skills.

====Delaque====
Other hivers are justifiably suspicious of House Delaque, who specialise in spying and assassination. The gangers often wear large trench coats, with large internal pockets for concealing weapons and other large items. Most are bald and extremely pale. Many wear visors, goggles, or have light filters implanted into their eyes, sensitivity to light being a common Delaque weakness. Delaque territory is even more dimly lit than the rest of the hive, fitting for people who are shrouded in mystery.

From a player perspective, House Delaque are the ranged specialists, with their gangers having access to Shooting, Agility, and Stealth skills.

====Escher====
Strikingly different from the other houses, the Escher population is almost entirely made up of women. The few men that are there are shrivelled and imbecilic and play no part in the normal affairs of the Escher. Men are held in contempt and pitied by the Escher, especially those of House Goliath who are seen as simple, brutish and unsophisticated.

From a player perspective, House Escher is a fast-moving and hard-to-hit close combat gang with their gangers having access to Combat, Agility, and Stealth skills.

====Goliath====
The domain of House Goliath is situated unfavourably within Hive City and occupies some of the deepest and harshest areas. By way of compensation, the Goliaths are tough and persistent by inclination. They consider the hivers of other Houses to be soft and slack. In truth all hivers are naturally robust, being inured to the toxins and deprivations which they accept unquestioningly as part of normal life. The Goliaths, however, take a stubborn pride in their ability to endure hardship. 
The other Houses see the Goliaths as barbaric, and unpredictable. Goliath institutions such as the fighting pits and the Feast of the Fallen do nothing to dispel the impression of a violent people inimical to their neighbours. Size and strength are seen as the measure of a man. Their style of dress emphasises a preoccupation with physique, featuring weighty chains and spiked metal bracers.

From a player perspective, House Goliath is a slow-moving close combat gang, being the only house to have gangers with access to Strength skills, and also having Combat and Ferocity skills.

====Van Saar====
House Van Saar is renowned for the quality of its technical products. Its technology is no more advanced than that of anyone else, technological progress being almost non-existent throughout the Imperium of Man, but the manufacturing processes are precise and its finished materials are of the highest quality. The Noble Houses pay a premium for Van Saar goods, and as a result, the House is probably the wealthiest in Hive City. The Van Saar are marked out by their tight-fitting bodysuits which help to sustain them in the harsh hive environment. Semi-permeable membranes in the suit reduce the loss of body moisture whilst various spots on the material change color to warn the wearer of airborne toxins and reduce oxygen levels. Older Van Saar are often seen sporting a neatly trimmed beard.
From a player perspective, House Van Saar is the only house whose gangers have access to tech skills - and they back this up with shooting and combat skills.

=== Other groups ===

==== Enforcers ====
The Enforcers are the chief source of law enforcement in the underhive of Necromunda. Modelled closely after the Adeptus Arbites, the Enforcers apply the laws set down by the High Lords of Terra with an iron fist. Equipped with heavy armour and sophisticated weapons and equipment, Enforcer patrol teams quell riots, suppress inter-gang warfare as much as possible, and monitor mercantile trade to ensure compliance with imperial law .

The Enforcers, while maintaining an organisational structure similar to that of the Adeptus Arbites, are a separate force. The Adeptus Arbites enforce Imperial law on a galactic scale, whereas the Enforcers maintain order within the confines of Hive Primus.

From a player perspective, you always have ten enforcers, but only use five in most battles. They are all well equipped and reliable but almost invariably outnumbered.

====The Cult of the Emperor&#x27;s Redemption====
A nod to &quot;Laserburn&quot;—the 15 mm tabletop game &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; evolved from—the Redemptionists have an extreme hatred of mutants and deviants from the Imperial creed. The most dedicated among them take up arms and hunt these mutants and deviants. They often wear red robes decorated with flame motifs and favour incendiary weaponry. House Cawdor lends much support to the cult of Redemption and has gone so far as to adopt it as their official religion. Their favoured weapon is the flamer, as the Redemptionist war cry is &quot;Cleanse with blood and with flame!&quot;

From a player perspective, the Redemptionists are chiefly known for two things; the one-shot flamers they can buy cheaply and put in two-handed weapons and the ability for the Priest leading many such gangs to convert captured enemies.

====Pit Slaves====
Slaves of the Guilder&#x27;s appendages are replaced by industrial tools such as giant saws and drills. When a group of slaves escapes, they already have weapons to help them survive along with experience gained in gladiator-style combat they are often pressed into.

From a player perspective, Pit Slaves are all experienced and expensive, having no cannon fodder. They also all have one of their arms replaced by an expensive close combat weapon.

====Ratskins====
The Ratskin tribes have lived within the underhive for millennia and treat it as a god, generous in its bounty and merciless in its vengeance. They have little to do with the hivers and are rarely encountered, preferring to steer clear of the heathens who desecrate their sacred hive by poisoning its sacred places.

From a player perspective, Ratskins are a fast close combat gang with no heavies to provide covering fire. They are also less affected by attrition than most gangs; injured Ratskins may re-roll the injury table results at the end of the battle, but they must accept the second result.

====Scavvies====
Scavvies are humans with mutations too obvious to hide, banished from normal settlements. In Scavvie gangs, the very dregs of society scrape out an existence robbing guilder caravans, raiding isolated settlements, and just generally scavenging whatever they can to survive. Their bands often include a stable sub-species of mutant, the giant reptilian Scalies. Scavvies have often been known to use bait to lure Plague zombies to attack rival gangs during their raids.

From a player perspective, Scavvies do not get anyone who carries heavy weapons and are not good at ranged attacks in general. On the other hand, the Scalies are the most powerful default close combat troops in the game, and they get a random number of disposable troops, such as plague zombies, for free each battle, providing them with targets that allow the rest of the gang to advance safely.

====Spyre Hunters====
Young nobles from the Spire come down to hunt underhive gangsters and thereby prove their worth in a world of ruthless politics, plotting, and assassination. Spyre gangs are few in number, and equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry (this can include heavily customised power armour). It is reported that they get at least some of their technology from trading with the Tau Empire.

From a player perspective, Spyre Hunters are a very small and extremely well-equipped elite gang and are the only gang that can not replace any casualties they suffer.

====Alternative gangs====
In addition to the gang types supported by the rulebooks, various Games Workshop publications have introduced new groups, sometimes supported by mail-order only model ranges, including Ash Waste Gangsters, Imperial Guard, various Chaos Cult gangs, Genestealer Cults, Ork warbands, and Squat Miners.
==History==
&quot;Necromunda&quot; was spun off from a previous attempt of Games Workshop to popularise a set of rules for low-key skirmish battles in a Hive World setting. &quot;White Dwarf&quot; published such a ruleset between autumn and winter 1990–91 dubbing it &quot;Confrontation&quot;. It was set on the hive world of Necromunda but made no reference to houses and such, instead of concentrating on the various types of gangs: clan warriors from the spires, brat &#x27;poseurs&#x27; from the upper levels which went &#x27;down&#x27; to experience the thrills of lowlife, undercity mutants, diseased scavengers from the toxic wastes and the Adeptus Arbites ever-ready to deal swift and summary &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;-like justice.

The miniatures released for this game were designed by John Blanche. The game background also included some elements later re-used in &quot;Necromunda&quot;, such as the &#x27;spook&#x27; psychic drug, and some which were disregarded, such as the &#x27;caryatids&#x27;, largely unexplained blue-skinned cherubs which were presented as unique and integral to Necromundan life.

Compared to the current &quot;Necromunda&quot;, &quot;Confrontation&quot; had a more complex system for resolving combat, particularly firing—portions of which were similar in style to &quot;Laserburn&quot;, a miniatures game that had influenced &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. In 2003, Games Workshop released a new 148-page gaming sourcebook titled &quot;Necromunda Underhive&quot;.

As &quot;Necromunda&quot; continued to flourish, various characters and &quot;hangers-on&quot; whose entries and stats are available in the various &quot;Necromunda&quot; publications have had models released under Games Workshops&#x27; &quot;ForgeWorld&quot; imprint. Models for &quot;Necromunda&quot; that are for sale at Forgeworld range from unnamed &quot;hive scum&quot; and &quot;dome runners&quot; and other no-names who make a living serving the various gangs of Necromunda; to various characters and &quot;specialty&quot; models, such as the Mercator Slavers Guild, Kal Jericho, and Scabbs, and the Orlock Road Warrior Slade Merdena and his Cyber Mastiff, Macula amongst many others.

===2017 relaunch===
On 13 August 2017, Games Workshop announced that a new edition of the game was in development. The new version, titled &quot;Necromunda: Underhive&quot; was released on 24 November 2017 with gangs Escher and Goliath. More gangs followed in 2018, and now all six major houses are represented. In addition, a range of characters is also available. In March 2019, the Ambot kit was released, giving players the chance to field powerful close combat &#x27;androids&#x27; for the first time.

Since the release of the core &quot;Underhive&quot; release, the game has seen strong reception which has led to continued support for the game. 2018 saw the release of quarterly supplements, referred to as &quot;Gang War&quot;, volumes I - IV (Goliaths and Eschers; Orlock; Van Saar; Cawdor), each one covering a different gang in-depth, as well as expanding trading post options and providing new mission and campaign supplements. In the December 2018 &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, a fifth insert supplement was added to cover off the last core gang, Delaque.

In 2019, a revised version of the Core Rules, as well as an updated consolidation of all the gang war content, was published under a single title &quot;Gangs of the Underhive&quot;. Throughout 2019, Games Workshop continued providing additional supplementation for the game through books that explored additional options, each one including additional gang options, additional Dramatis Personae/Bounty Hunters, and additional campaign options:

* Book of Judgment - Includes new campaign supplements as well as rules for Palanite Enforcers, The Law enforcement arm of Necromunda
* Book of Peril - Includes the Venator Gang rules, new campaign supplements, rules for Psychers/Spykers, and additional Bounty Hunters such as Kal Jericho and Scabbs.
* Book of Ruin - Includes rules for Corpse Grinders, Chaos Helots, and Genestealers. It also covers more campaign content as well as rules for models tainted with Chaos.

In addition to these campaigns and support supplements, Games Workshop would release a second two-player starter box for the game called &quot;Necromunda: Dark Uprising&quot;. The box set saw an ambitious start package for new players which included models for the Palanite Enforcers and Subjugators squaring off against the Corpse Grinder Cult. The starter would also be the first to include a comprehensive 3D plastic terrain kit that allowed players to explore the three-dimensional playscape the game has to offer by including elements such as elevators and stairs. The kit also came with a new &quot;Dark Uprising&quot; campaign book. Much of the contents for the Corpse Grinders and Palanite Enforcers/Subjugators in the campaign module mirrors the content published in &quot;The Book of Ruin&quot; and &quot;The Book of Judgment&quot; published earlier in 2019, but also offered the players a unique campaign that was only available in the box set.

The 2020 release for &quot;Necromunda&quot; began focusing on expansions for the previously established &quot;Core Gangs&quot;, with a planned release for each gang. These books include an extensive history of the gang, including relationships with the various guilds of Necromunda as well as relationships with the higher &quot;noble houses&quot; of Necromunda. In addition to the new books, each book would see releases on both the Games Workshop line and the Forgeworld line to allow players to use models specifically made for the new material in the book.

These books were expected to adhere to a quarterly release, but complications stemming from the global COVID-19 pandemic delayed the development of these volumes. Prior to COVID-19, Games Workshop was able to get the first volume, &quot;House of Chains&quot; into circulation before halting the production of subsequent books. In June 2020, Games Workshop announces that they were restarting the production and development of these books. Below are the currently released books, as well as any further announced ones:

* House of Artifice - Focuses on House Van Saar 
* House of Blades - Focuses on House Escher 
* House of Chains - Focuses on House Goliath, also includes a new playable gang, the Ogryn Slave gang 
* House of Faith - Focuses on House Cawdor 
* House of Iron - Focuses on House Orlock 
* House of Shadow - Focuses on House Delaque 

To further supplement the existing models and rules, &quot;Book of the Outcast&quot; was launched in December 2021, alongside the requisite Tactics cards and models. The book contained a more robust &quot;Psychic Ruleset&quot; as well as a more Dramatis Personae and additional minor subgroups of other gangs. . 

Continuing Releases

Ash Wastes

After releasing supplements for all of the core houses as well as the book of Outcasts, Games Workshop began publishing content othat took players beyond the walls of Hive Primus. Taking players into the Ash wastes outside of the walls of Hive Primus, this backdrop was explored in both a new Box set referred to as &quot;the Ash Wastes&quot; as well as the release of the &quot;Book of the Outlands.&quot; The Book of the Outlands provided players with the official release for the Ash Wastelanders gang as well as rules for both newly released vehicles for navigating the wastes for each gang, but also rules to make your own, whether they be made of kitbashsed materials from other existing kits; or of household components at the discretion of the builder/player. In addition to these details, it also provided players for the &quot;Iron Squat Prospectors&quot; gang, a group of space dwarfs or &quot;Squats&quot; which bridged with the release of the Leagues of Votann army for Warhammer 40,000 which had come out earlier in the same year. 

The Aranthian Cycle and Core Rules Refit 

The Aranthian Cycle, released throughout 2023 was Games workshop&#x27;s first attempt at a large scale campaign. Spanning three books released at different points throughout the year, the Aranthian Cycle focused on the attempted murder of Lord Helmawyr, and the chaos that ensued after. The saga is covered over the course of three titles, each one serving as an &quot;act&quot; in the larger story and including threads for players to follow to accommodate a major narrative event within the world. The Books in the series, in order are &quot;Cinderak Burns&quot;, &quot;The Vaults of Temenos&quot; and &quot;Ruins of Jardlan&quot;. Major plot points include the assassination attempt on Lord Helmawr, the High lord of Necromunda, as well as the arrival of key characters, including several of Helmawr&#x27;s children. In addition to this three-volume campaign, a new core rulebook was released which aimed at amending rules disparities captured in the first Core rules book from 2019, as well as consolidating it with key components captured in the &quot;Gangs of the Underhive&quot; book that was not necessarily captured in the release of the individual gang books. 

Hive Secundus

In 2024, Games workshop took us to the ruins of Hive Secundus, a hive that was once known as a hub of scholarship and accelerated scientific progress. What remains now is a still-smoking ruin after Lord Helmawr ordered it to be razed to the ground and below due to the result of one genesmith tinkering with genestealer DNA which led to a genestealer incursion. As the story goes, the resources and treasures still present in the ruin have attracted the attentions of Spyre hunters, as well as the last remaining heir to the Helmawr dynasty. However, parts of the underhive of secundus remains intact, and the strains of genestealer DNA that survived have been left to evolve and mutate into what is now known as the Malstrain Genestealers, a horrific hybrid of proto-human DNA fused with that of the genestealers.

==Reception==
Mark Donald reviewed &quot;Necromunda&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Donald comments that &quot;It&#x27;s a spawn of the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe and the family resemblance is marked, but this time there&#x27;s a rumble in the concrete jungle. And fortunately, you&#x27;re in the thick of it.&quot;

<text>Alvarelhão is a red wine grape grown in northern Portugal.

==History==
Alvarelhão must have originated in northern Portugal, but little is known of its ancestry. DNA studies have shown some similarity to Esgana Cão.

==Distribution and Wines==

===Portugal===
In Portugal there are 470 hectares of either Alvarelhão or the grape called Brancelho. It is blended into red wine in the Dão region. It is said to be part of the port wine blend in the Douro, although it is not mentioned on the IVDP website as one of the main 11 red grapes of the Douro.

===Spain===
In Spain Alvarelhão is grown as Brancellao, where they also use the synonym of Albarello. It is one of the authorised varieties in the Galician wine regions of Rías Baixas DOP and Ribeira Sacra. Although similar in name, it is different from Albariño.

===United States===
There have been some experiments with the port grapes in California. It is possible that some vines have been misidentified, as the University of California, Davis clone Alvarelhão FPMS 02 has now been confirmed as a Touriga Nacional.

==Vine and Viticulture==
Having evolved in the Dão, the vine is both rough and hardy, having strong defenses against temperature extremes and inclement weather.

==Synonyms==
Alvarelhao, Alvarello, Locaia, Pilongo and Varancelha.

German sources, including :de:Brancelho, refer to a Brancelho grape used in Vinho Verde whose synonyms include Alvarelhão Ceitão, Varancelho and Verancelha. It is not certain that this is the same grape as Alvarelhão.

Spanish synonyms include Brancellao and Albarello.

<text>Space Hulk is a 1993 real-time tactical video game for MS-DOS, Amiga and PC-98. The game was based on Games Workshop&#x27;s 1989 board game of the same name. Set in the fictional &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, the player directs squads of Space Marines, genetically enhanced armoured soldiers, in their missions to protect the human race from deadly aliens. &quot;Space Hulk&quot; was developed and published by Electronic Arts, with support from Games Workshop.

The game takes place aboard huge derelicts known as space hulks. Drifting in and out of the Warp—an alternate dimension used to cross interstellar distances—these vessels are infested with the four-armed Genestealers. Using overhead maps, the player orders the Marine squads, and controls individual Marines via first-person shooter interfaces. The game features a time-limited option to pause the action while enabling the player to continue issuing commands.

&quot;Space Hulk&quot;″s theme of pitting slow and heavily armed Marines against fast, deadly Genestealers produced moments of frantic gameplay and a scary atmosphere for its reviewers, earning positive ratings for the game. A few reviewers, however, felt the game was too difficult and proved to be too frustrating. &quot;Space Hulk&quot; was followed up by &quot;Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels&quot; in 1996.

==Gameplay==
The game features 51 missions that involve exterminations, retrieval of objects, and rearguard actions. A campaign, comprising 21 of these missions played in sequence, centres around a story about a Space Marine investigation of a distress beacon in a region of space threatened by Genestealers. The remaining missions are tutorials designed to help players learn the game and standalone missions. Before a mission, the game briefs the player on the objectives and shows a small map of the operational area. Marines are usually equipped with a gun—the Storm Bolter—for long-range combat, and an energised glove—the Power Fist—for hand-to-hand fighting. For certain missions, the player can customise the squads&#x27; armaments, selecting from 10 other weapons, such as Heavy Flamers for destroying targets and the Chainfist for opening locked doors. In the campaign, Marines who survive a mission gain experience, improving their combat abilities and chances of survival for future missions.
The player&#x27;s Marines begin each mission grouped together at one or two starting points of the operational area, while Genestealers continually enter from marked entry points. Gameplay at this stage takes place between two separate interfaces: the Terminator View Screen, where the player takes direct control of individual Marines, and the Planning Screen, where orders are issued to the Marines by clicking on command icons. The Planning Screen has two maps; the smaller one on the bottom-left shows the operational area and the larger one displays a close-up view of the region selected by the player. Shown on the maps are the continuously updated positions of the Marines and their enemies. The game simulates fog of war by blacking out unexplored areas on the maps and representing unseen Genestealers as blips, unveiling them as Marines come within sight.

Switching to the Terminator View Screen offers a first-person perspective of the mission through the Marines&#x27; eyes. The Screen contains five monitors: a large primary monitor at the bottom and four smaller secondary displays arrayed above. The primary monitor displays the view of the Marine under the player&#x27;s control. The character is moved by pressing the keyboard&#x27;s cursor keys or clicking the directional arrows next to the monitor. The mouse is also used to aim and shoot at targets, although the computer determines if an accurate shot kills the target. The secondary monitors show the views of other squad members. Although the player cannot control the movements of these Marines through these interfaces, he or she can click them to shoot the Marines&#x27; weapons at the centre of their views. However, the player can take full control of a Marine by switching the character&#x27;s view to the primary monitor.

At any time, Marines armed with Storm Bolters and not under the player&#x27;s control assume &quot;Overwatch&quot; mode, automatically firing at obstacles and enemies that come into their paths. Storm Bolters have unlimited ammo, but may jam under sustained firing, rendering the weapon useless for a few seconds until the malfunction is cleared. In melee, the Power Fist is of limited effectiveness against a Genestealer&#x27;s razor-sharp claws, while Marines armed with Lightning Claws or Thunder Hammer &amp; Storm Shield are hand-to-hand specialists who forgo a ranged weapon.

Although the action unfolds in real-time, the player can pause the game by clicking the &quot;Freeze&quot; button and entering &quot;Freeze Time&quot;. During this mode, all units stop moving while a timer runs down; the player can freely issue and modify orders to the Marines. Once the timer is depleted or the Freeze button is clicked again, every unit resumes its movement. The timer for Freeze Time slowly replenishes, as long as the game stays in real-time.

== Synopsis ==

=== Setting ===
&quot;Space Hulk&quot; is a video game based on a 1989 board game of the same name. Set in the fictional &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, the video game tasks the player to take control of genetically enhanced soldiers called Space Marines. As veterans of their Space Marine Chapter who earn the right to wear powered exoskeletons known as Terminator Armor, these Marines embark on missions aboard the eponymous derelict starships that drift in and out of the Warp, an alternate region of space where vast interstellar distances can be traversed in a short time. The vessels are infested with Genestealers, four-armed aliens, who invade worlds encountered in the ships&#x27; paths. Sworn to protect the human race, the Marines aim to eradicate the alien threat.

=== Plot ===

&quot;Space Hulk&quot;″s campaign is mostly exposited through pre-mission briefings. The prologue in the manual says the Dark Angels, a force of Space Marines, had repelled a Genestealer incursion in the Tolevi system many centuries before current events in the game. A Dark Angel hero was leading his men aboard the invading space hulk, &quot;Sin of Damnation&quot;, when it vanished into the warp. The first mission in the campaign sends the player&#x27;s squad to investigate the Tolevi system for a distress call of Dark Angels&#x27; origin. A nest of Genestealers is uncovered on the planet Ma&#x27;Caellia, and the player&#x27;s forces are ordered to destroy the aliens&#x27; Hive Mind. However, there are too many Genestealers, and the Marines are forced to withdraw. Without any other options, the Marines destroy the infestation and all other life forms on the planet through exterminatus with virus bombs—biological weapons of mass destruction. As they are doing so, the &quot;Sin of Damnation&quot; re-enters the system, and the player receives orders to invade the hulk. Aboard the vessel, the player&#x27;s squads destroy the Genestealers&#x27; gene banks and their Patriarch. The end of the campaign tasks the player to control a lone Marine as he goes deep into the hulk to find the source of the distress call.

==Development==
The original &quot;Space Hulk&quot; board game was published by Games Workshop. It was the company&#x27;s third board game that was adapted as a video game; the previous two board games were &quot;HeroQuest&quot; and &quot;Space Crusade&quot;, whose video game adaptations were both published by Gremlin Graphics. The board game version of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; is played between two players, who assume the roles of the Marines and Genestealers. The players take turns moving their pieces to accomplish their objectives; the Marines&#x27; player, however, is given a certain amount of time to finish each of their turns. The game is designed to encourage the two players to adopt different tactics in their play—the slow-moving Space Marines with long-range guns versus the fast-moving Genestealers who fight hand-to-hand.

Conversion of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; into a video game was initiated in 1991 by Electronic Arts, who also managed the project&#x27;s development. Instead of following Gremlin&#x27;s approach and creating exact copies of the board games in digital form, Electronic Arts and Games Workshop opted to develop a video game, based on &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, with features that took advantage of the personal computer&#x27;s technological advancements. The interior walls of the space hulks were rendered by ray tracing, passing much of the graphical work to computers. This method reduced the time needed to introduce new sets of walls into the game from two weeks to twelve hours. Although digital speech was a relatively new technology at the time, the team made use of sound card technologies to produce alien screeches and roars that permeate the hulks, and warning cries from Marines under attack. The game&#x27;s opening tune, &quot;Get Out Of My Way&quot;, was recorded by British hard rock band D-Rok, with Brian May of Queen as guest guitarist. Games Workshop helped Electronic Arts keep the game true to its &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; roots by providing the writers with materials and answers on the fictional universe. The development team created the tutorial missions, but adapted the other missions straight from the board game and the &quot;Deathwing Campaign&quot; expansion set.

Initially released in June 1993 on floppy disks for IBM Personal Computers and their clones that ran DOS, &quot;Space Hulk&quot; was later published for other platforms and media. The CD-ROM version of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; included nine new missions, new cinematic animations, and new digital sound effects and speech (which required a sound card). Unlike the versions that ran on DOS, the Amiga version (published in Autumn 1993) cannot be installed on a hard drive; Amiga users have to swap floppy disks at several points of the game while playing it. In Japan, the game was ported to the NEC PC-9821 by a local video game company, Starcraft. In 1996, Electronic Arts produced a sequel, &quot;Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels&quot;, to &quot;Space Hulk&quot;.

==Reception==

Reviewers noted the atmosphere experienced while playing &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, describing it as similar to the science-fiction film &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986). Aside from the concept of pitting heavily armed soldiers against aliens that looked like H. R. Giger&#x27;s &quot;exo-skeletal nightmares&quot;, &quot;Space Hulk&quot;″s Terminator View Screen was reminiscent of a sequence in the film where a marine lieutenant monitored and ordered his troops as they executed a mission in a dark, dank environment.

Handling slow, cumbersome Marines against fast, deadly Genestealers proved to be intense sessions of panic and fear for the game&#x27;s critics. They were stressed from monitoring several Marines at the same time while Genestealers probed the flanks and sent decoys to lure Marines to their deaths. Despite playing in a well-lit, noisy office, David Upchurch of &quot;The One&quot; said the game &quot;[scared] the pants off&quot; him, and Jeff James of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that because of the combination of &quot;excellent use of digitized sound&quot; and &quot;Genestealers rendered in sickening purple hue&quot;, &quot;More than once I jumped out of my command chair&quot;. A February 1994 survey of space war games in the magazine gave it a grade of B, stating that &quot;graphics are superb and there is gore aplenty&quot;, but comparing non-controlled squad members to &quot;Star Trek&quot; redshirts. A May 1994 survey in the magazine of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game three-plus stars out of five, stating that it was &quot;as authentic as you&#x27;ll find, with great graphics and sound&quot;. &quot;CU Amiga&quot;″s Tony Dillon believed the game was not for those with &quot;a weak heart&quot;, and &quot;Compute!&quot;″s Scott May declared the game &quot;a bug blaster&#x27;s nightmare come true.&quot; The game further evoked a sense of esprit de corps with its monastic-style briefings, according to &quot;Amiga User International&quot;. However, video game journalist Alec Meer remembered the briefings as &quot;one of videogame history&#x27;s greatest atmosphere-spoilers&quot; for their flat deliveries.

Besides its atmosphere, &quot;Space Hulk&quot;″s game mechanics received close attention. Lester Smith of &quot;Dragon&quot; said the video game was an excellent adaptation of its original tabletop form. He praised Electronic Arts for conveying the &quot;bug-hunting experience on its own merits, using the computer&#x27;s strength&quot;, rather than trying to imitate those aspects of the board game. Upchurch, along with Rik Skews of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, agreed, pointing out that the electronic version was better off with the concept of Freeze Time than implementing a recreation of dice rolls and sequence of turns found in the board game. A few reviewers disagreed. Dee and Jay of &quot;Dragon&quot; wanted a &quot;computer game that was faithful to the elements of the board game&quot;, and said the video game&#x27;s design proved too difficult for them; they found controlling five or more Marines in real-time against Genestealers impossible. Similarly, &quot;Amiga Force&quot;″s Mark Smith and Ian Osborne were flustered by having to command several Marines at the same time while they came under sudden attacks from several directions. The Marines&#x27; slow speed were another frustration. Offering another insight, Meer opined the Marines&#x27; slow response was integral to the game&#x27;s atmosphere: made slow and cumbersome by the game&#x27;s design and interface, the Marines&#x27; battles against fast and deadly foes became nerve-wrecking affairs for the player. Likewise, May found the multitasking nature of the game crucial to its intensity. Rob Mead offered an opinion not from a player of the board game in his article for &quot;Amiga Format&quot;. He rated the video game &quot;very good, but not brilliant&quot;, and suggested it would appeal more to aficionados of the board game because such players tend to appreciate attention to detail, planning, and tactics.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Space Hulk&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #38 (1993), giving it a final evaluation of &quot;Excellent&quot; and stated that &quot;even after playing the same scenario time after time (learning new tricks all the while), I kept going back for more. I was never bored and never upset. It&#x27;s that much fun. Besides, once one has entered the &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, frankly, it becomes personal - the Genestealers have killed your brothers-in-arms and it&#x27;s up to you to deliver the payback!&quot;

Amiga reviewers had a common grouse: the frequent disk swaps required were tedious. Regardless, the game&#x27;s tense atmosphere—generated by the combination of game mechanics, use of sounds, and artificial intelligence—provided memorable moments to many reviewers. As one of them—Simon Clays of &quot;Amiga Computing&quot;—put it, &quot;Space Hulk&quot; was &quot;a very difficult strategy-cum-3D dungeon-esque title with plenty of action and gripping play.&quot; May said the game offered &quot;demented&quot; violence, but was &quot;irresistibly exhiliarating when the action erupts in nonstop, heartpounding carnage.&quot; A decade after the game&#x27;s release, several reviewers mentioned &quot;Space Hulk&quot; as a &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; video game worthy of praise. Meer reflected on replaying the game fifteen years after its release, &quot;The panic and terror of facing 90 degrees away from your enemy, and knowing that you can&#x27;t do a damn thing about it before your lower intestine spills onto your feet, is still something pretty special.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, and stated that &quot;if you like a heavy dose of atmosphere and a little strategy mixed in with the action, &quot;Space Hulk&quot; delivers.&quot;

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named &quot;Space Hulk&quot; the 10th best computer game of all time. The editors considered it uniquely high-quality for a board game adaptation, and wrote that &quot;the tension created as you struggle to keep your group alive against increasingly insurmountable odds is incredible.&quot;

<text>Richard Quitevis (born October 7, 1969) known by his stage name DJ Qbert or Qbert, is a Filipino American turntablist and composer who has heavily influenced the History of DJing. He was awarded America&#x27;s Best DJ in 2010, was DMC USA Champion 1991 (solo) and achieved titles as DMC World Champion in 1992 and 1993.

==Early life==
Richard Quitevis was born on October 7, 1969, to Filipino immigrant parents hailing from Bacolod, Negros Occidental and Ilocos Sur. Growing up in San Francisco&#x27;s Excelsior District on Moscow Street, he graduated from Luther Burbank Middle School and in 1987 from Balboa High School. Qbert started playing with records at the age of 15, although he got his first Fisher-Price turntable as a toddler. He was influenced by the street performers and graffiti artists of the local hip hop community in the mid-1980s. It was at Balboa&#x27;s school cafeteria that he first met Mix Master Mike in a DJ battle; the two have been good friends ever since.

==Career==
Qbert started his musical career in a group called FM20 with Mix Master Mike and DJ Apollo in 1990. In New York City when playing a show, FM20 was spotted by Crazy Legs, who invited them to join the Rock Steady Crew. They accepted the offer to join the crew. Going by the name Rock Steady DJs, they then proceeded to take the 1992 Disco Mix Club World DJ Championships (DMC) world title. Qbert was also one of the founding members of the band Invisibl Skratch Piklz. Although there were other turntablist crews before the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, the Skratch Piklz were the first to apply the band concept to turntablism, layering drums, basslines, and scratch solos on top of each other.

Qbert, along with other Skratch Piklz, created a series of videos entitled &quot;Turntable TV&quot;. Now out of print, the first 5 episodes were released on VHS and contained demonstrations, showcases, skits, and other DJ related content.

Qbert&#x27;s solo efforts include 1994&#x27;s &quot;Demolition Pumpkin Squeeze Musik&quot;, and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Wave Twisters&quot;. The latter album was created mainly with samplers and beat machines versus the turntable, and later turned into an animated feature of the same title. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Wave Twisters&quot; movie was somewhat unusual in that the animators and digital artists had to invent images and movements to the pre-recorded music, as opposed to the other way around (Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; was made the same way).

More recently, he has worked with Vestax to develop the QFO, an all-in-one scratching instrument. The QFO combines a turntable with a mixer&#x27;s crossfader. In 2006, he introduced the Qbert turntable cartridge, a model put out by Ortofon.
In May 2009, Qbert launched the Qbert Skratch University, an interactive online learning school and community for DJs through the ArtistWorks website.

At the 2016 edition of the DMC World DJ Championships, DJ Q-Bert was awarded with a DMC Legend jacket.

==Personal life==
In a 2011 interview with the website WeBeVegan.org, Qbert stated that he is a vegan.

==Media appearances==
Qbert&#x27;s music was featured in the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground &quot;and he appeared as himself on the Slam City Jam level. He also appeared as himself in &quot;DJ Hero 2&quot;.

<doc id="955745" wikidata="Q7278000" url="?curid=955745" title="RV-C">
<text>RV-C is a communications protocol based on the Controller Area Network bus. The protocol is used in recreation vehicles to allow house and chassis components to communicate. RV-C is used for control, coordination, and diagnostics, in a multi-vendor environment.

== Development History ==

RV-C was initially developed by the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association. The first formal specification was approved in 2005, and the first RV-C products were marketed at that time. The RVIA has continued to refine and expand the protocol, and in 2008 applied to ISO with the intention of opening the RV-C protocol to the world community.

In 2006 the first RV-C-equipped RVs were sold in America. The leading adopters were Country Coach, Foretravel, Newell Coach, and Western RV. RV-C-compliant components for these RVs were manufactured by Valid Manufacturing Ltd., Automated Engineering Corp, SilverLeaf Electronics, and HWH Corporation.

In 2007, the RVIA hosted a Network Fest at their main industry show. The Fest was an educational event featuring over two dozen RV-C compliant products from 14 exhibitors.

== Protocol Overview ==

RV-C is based on Controller Area Network, and operates at a bus speed of 250 kbit/s. Data is contained in packets consisting of a header and eight data bytes. The header contains an 8-bit Source Address and a 17-bit Parameter Group Number, as well as a few additional bits. The total bus capacity is approximately 2500 data packets per second, although in practice bus loads are much lower.

RV-C is peer-to-peer. Each CAN transceiver on the network requires a unique source address, which can be assigned either dynamically or statically. Data packets are prioritized based on their contents, not the device.

The Application Layer details the Parameter Group Numbers, which uniquely identifies how the contents of the data packet are to be interpreted. The primary work of the RV-C committee is the creation of new Parameter Groups as new components are introduced in the RV marketplace.

To be considered RV-C-compliant, a device must support certain PGNs. These are

* Address Claiming. This is mandatory even for statically-addressed devices.
* Diagnostics. The DM1-RVC PGN provides essential information on the device capabilities and status.
* Request for PGN. When asked for specific data, the device must respond.
* Product ID. This is text data essential for a service technician to identify the device.

A key concept in RV-C is the instance. In an RV, multiple &quot;instances&quot; of a device are common. RV-C handles this using a unique method in which an instance number is assigned to each physical unit of a certain type.

An idea that underlies much of RV-C&#x27;s design is that &quot;every data packet stands alone&quot;. That is, with very few exceptions, all the information necessary to interpret a data packet is contained within that packet. This greatly reduces the memory and speed required for a microprocessor to implement the protocol. In general, the committee has been intent on keeping the cost of implementation to a minimum.

== Relationship to SAE J1939 ==

RV-C draws heavily from the SAE J1939 protocol. The primary differences between J1939 and RV-C are:

* SAE J1939 does not support RV-C&#x27;s &quot;instancing&quot;.
* The main diagnostic message (DM1) has somewhat different formats, due to the need in RV-C for instance identification.
* The SAE J1939 NAME PGN is simplified in RV-C.

<doc id="955751" wikidata="Q6657111" url="?curid=955751" title="Live ball (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, when the ball is alive (or &quot;in play&quot;), the game can proceed. The pitcher may pitch the ball, the batter may attempt to hit such a pitch, baserunners may attempt to advance at their own risk, and the defense may attempt to put the batter or baserunners out.

==Definition==
The ball becomes live when the pitcher is on the pitcher&#x27;s plate ready to pitch; the batter, catcher, and the umpire are all ready; and the umpire calls or signals &quot;Play&quot;.

The ball remains alive until it becomes dead by a number of different occurrences. Thus, the ball often remains alive even after playing action ends. Technically, the ball remains alive between half-innings, though no action can occur after the end of a half-inning until the first pitch of the next half-inning.

==Examples==
Participants must always be alert and attentive when the ball is alive; vigilance can be relaxed when the ball is dead. Thus it is important for players to always know whether the ball is alive. One infamous incident occurred in Game 2 of the 1998 American League Championship Series, which featured the New York Yankees against the Cleveland Indians. With Enrique Wilson on first base and no outs, the Indians&#x27; Travis Fryman laid down a bunt that first baseman Tino Martinez fielded inside the line. Martinez&#x27;s throw to Chuck Knoblauch, covering first base, hit Fryman in the back and caromed 20 feet away.

Instead of chasing down the ball, Knoblauch ignored it to argue with umpire Ted Hendry, claiming interference by Fryman. During the debate, Wilson rounded the bases to score the go-ahead run.

Knoblauch later confessed that he saw the play as a &quot;no-brainer&quot; interference call, and he likely assumed that the ball would become dead. However, this interference call was the very call in dispute, and the umpire saw it differently. The Yankees thus lost that game, but still went on to win the series.

<text>Trousseau () or Trousseau Noir, also known as Bastardo and Merenzao, is an old variety of red wine grape originating in eastern France. It is grown in small amounts in many parts of Western Europe; the largest plantations are today found in Portugal, where most famously it is used in port wine. It makes deep cherry red wines with high alcohol and high, sour candy acidity, and flavours of red berry fruits, often complemented - depending on production - by a jerky nose and an organic, mossy minerality.

==History and pedigree==
Trousseau originated in eastern France where it was once widely cultivated, and DNA profiling has indicated that the variety has a parent-offspring relationship with Savagnin, and that it is a sibling to Chenin blanc and Sauvignon blanc. DNA profiling has likewise shown that Trousseau has been cultivated on the Iberian Peninsula for at least 200 years under several different names, including Bastardo, but it is unknown how it came to be introduced there.

Trousseau gris is a white mutation of Trousseau Noir, occasionally found in Jura and once common in California under the name &#x27;Gray Riesling&#x27;.

Genouillet is the result of a cross between Gouais blanc (Heunisch) and Bastardo.

In 1938 Harold Olmo used Trousseau to pollinate the &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; hybrid Alicante Ganzin to produce the Royalty variety.

Bastardo was crossed with the Georgian variety Saperavi to produce the Bastardo Magarachskii variety used in the Crimea.

==Distribution and Wines==
A little is grown in Argentina and in several regions of Spain, including the Canary Islands.

===Australia===
There are a small number of producers of Trousseau in Australia with plantings in Tasmania, Margaret River in Western Australia (Amato Vino release a small quantity each year in the Jura style) and Barossa Valley, South Australia. A small amount is also grown in eastern Australia under the name Gros Cabernet.

===France===
Trousseau is one of five grape varieties allowed in the Jura wine appellations, but only covers 5% of the Jura vineyards since it requires more sun than other Jura varieties to ripe. It is often used to stiffen blends with the pale Poulsard, which is easier to cultivate. In 2009, there was a total of of Trousseau in France.

===Portugal===
It is part of the blend for port wine and also an important variety for red wines in the Dão. A total of of Trousseau, mostly under the name Bastardo, is cultivated in the vineyards of Portugal. It is also grown in very small quantities in Madeira, and a small number of vintage wines labelled Bastardo were made.

===Spain===
In Spain Trousseau is grown under the names of Merenzao, Bastardo, Bastardo Negro, María Ordoña, Maturana Tinta, Tintilla, and Verdejo Negro. It is an authorised variety in the Galician DOPS of Ribiera Sacra and Valdeorras DOPs in Galicia. It has also been included in Rioja DOCa under the name of Maturana Tinta, but it is listed as a separate variety to Trousseau / Merenzao even though they are genetically indistinct.

===United States===
As in Portugal, it has been historically used to make fortified wines, but nowadays also some single varietal wines. It remains a confidential variety, with only 115.6 tons crushed in 2023 in California.

==Vine and Viticulture==
It needs hot, dry conditions to do well. The name Trousseau (from Old French &quot;trusse&quot;, meaning &quot;a bundle&quot;) is possibly a reference to the shape of the bunch, it looks &#x27;packed up&#x27;.

==Synonyms==
Trousseau is also known under the synonyms Abrunhal, Bastardinha, Bastardinho, Bastardo, Bastardo Do Castello, Bastardo Dos Frados, Bolonio, Capbreton Rouge, Carnaz, Chauche Noir, Cruchenton Rouge, Donzelino De Castille, Estaladiña, Graciosa, Gris De Salces, Gros Cabernet, Maria, Maria Adona, Maria Adorna, Maria Ardona, Maria Ordona, Maturana Tinta, Maturana Tinto, Maturano, Merenzano, Merenzao, Pardinho, Pecho, Pinot Gris De Rio Negro, Roibal, Sémillon Rouge, Tresseau, Triffault, Trousse, Trousseau, Trousseau Gris, Troussot, Trusiaux, Trusseau, Trussiau, Tintilla and Verdejo Tinto.

In the literature, it is often confused with Tressot.

<text>Ministry of Defence St Athan or MOD St Athan (Welsh: Maes awyr Sain Tathan), formerly known as Royal Air Force St Athan, or more simply RAF St Athan, is a large Ministry of Defence unit near the village of St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan, southern Wales.

The base was home to the RAF No. 4 School of Technical Training throughout its life, as well as a major aircraft maintenance unit. St Athan has also been used to house British Army units, including the 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards. At one time it was home to a large collection of historical aircraft.

The only flying unit to operate out of St Athan on a regular basis is the Universities of Wales Air Squadron. This unit is one of fourteen RAF University Air Squadrons, flying Grob Tutors. 2300 Squadron of the Air Training Corps is also located on the Station.

The airfield part of the site was transferred from military to civilian control on 1 April 2019. It is now owned by the Welsh Government and known as Bro Tathan airfield, and is home to Bro Tathan Business Park. MOD St Athan continues to exist, comprising the barracks area which is adjacent to the airfield.

The airbase is a prominent scrapping facility, used by eCube, together with Horizon Aircraft Services (formerly Hunter Flying).

==History==
=== RAF St Athan ===

==== Early days ====
The station officially opened as RAF (Royal Air Force) St Athan on 1 September 1938 and the first unit to take up residence was No. 4 School of Technical Training (4SofTT). In 1939, the station&#x27;s activities were expanded with the arrival of a fighter group pool, the School of Air Navigation, and a maintenance unit.

==== Second World War ====

The UK&#x27;s aircraft interception radar efforts were briefly housed at St Athan in late 1939 and early 1940. Prior to the war they had been located with the rest of the radar research efforts at Bawdsey Manor on the east coast, but with the opening of hostilities they were quickly moved to a tiny civilian airfield, Perth Airport (Scotland) outside Perth. Yet the conditions there entirely unsuited to their efforts. After a short search, St Athan was selected for the AI team while the rest of the researchers stayed in Dundee. When they too found the conditions unsuitable, both teams moved to Worth Matravers in May 1940.

A Special Duty Flight was formed at the station on 14 November 1939 to support the aircraft-borne radar efforts. It was established from the nucleus of the Station Flight which had been established when the researchers were briefly relocated to Scotland. It lasted less than two years, and was re-designated the Telecommunications Flying Unit in early November 1941. By that time it was located at RAF Hurn.

During the Second World War the station had over 14,000 personnel, and was used for training ground and air crew. It was linked to the aircraft storage and maintenance facility at RAF Llandow.

During the war a dummy airfield was built using wood and cardboard a few miles west of the original airfield and successful efforts were made to hide the proper field (supposedly led by Jasper Maskelyne). Aircraft and buildings were made of cardboard and wood and some real, but old tractors were driven around the site. The Germans attacked the dummy field a number of times and it was rebuilt each time.
On 15 July 1940, four bombs failed to explode, 2 of them near assembly sheds. It was unclear to the newly appointed bomb disposal team led by Colonel Stuart Archer GC whether they were dealing with delayed action fuses -then causing major disruptions to vital buildings and airfields or more likely booby-trapped devices. The decision was taken to move the bombs to be detonated elsewhere.

The following units were here at some point:

==== Post war ====
After the war, airmen of the Airframe and Engine trades continued to train at St Athan, but in 1955 this training dispersed to RAF Kirkham and RAF Weeton. 4SofTT then became a Boy Entrant School, with new recruits being trained in engine and airframe mechanics, and armament, electrical and instrument mechanics. It was at this time that approval was given by the Airforce Board of the Defence Council for the formation of 2300 Sqn ATC. Following the demise of the Boy Entrant scheme in 1965, airman training returned to St Athan for the vehicle and general and Airframe, Engine aircraft maintenance trades. 

Between May 1947 and August 1973, St Athan was also home for the Administrative Apprentice Training School, which provided a 20-month training programme for boys who enlisted to become clerks or work in accounting, supply and administration, prior to posting to other RAF units for a 12-year term of service.

During the 1960s, a driving school was established. Recruits that needed to drive (RAF Police, MT (Mechanical Transport) drivers, etc.) were trained in a fleet of Morris Minors, including &quot;Travellers&quot;, and were taught basic maintenance. The driving tests were normally taken in Cardiff and, once students had passed, they were then allowed to train in night and motorway driving, and practise on a skid-pan.

St Athan also became the major RAF maintenance base for Dominie, Vulcan, (minor servicing also from 1980) Victor, Buccaneer, Phantom, Harrier, Tornado, Jaguar, Hawk and VC10 aircraft, originally under direct RAF control, but latterly under the auspices of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA). Highly specialised major servicing of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight&#x27;s Avro Lancaster bomber was also conducted at RAF St Athan.

A new Aircraft Paint Facility of No. 1 Engineering Squadron, RAF St Athan was opened by the Permanent Under Secretary of State, MoD, Sir Michael Quinlan during January 1991.
The site carried out major servicing for VC-10s from February 1992 taking over from Brize Norton, along with third line maintenance for Hawks and Jaguar taking over from RAF Abingdon. The Victor Major Maintenance Unit was disbanded on 1 March 1992. The unit was formed at RAF Marham on 14 September 1988. 

RAF St Athan has been used to house a number of army units throughout its life and, in 2003, the 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards moved from Aldershot to St Athan – the first time they have been based in Wales since they were formed in 1915.

In March 2003 it was confirmed that a new hi-tech maintenance centre would be built, creating 3,300 jobs. Additional jobs would be created by allowing access to the super-hangar by commercial aviation partners. Project Red Dragon would replace RAF St Athan&#x27;s existing repair centre – spread out across the site – and create a new, state-of-the-art facility. In March 2004, however, DARA announced the loss of 550 jobs at St Athan as part of streamlining to make DARA more efficient and better able to compete with the private sector for lucrative aircraft repair contracts, but also because they lost out to a direct RAF bid for a contract to upgrade the air force&#x27;s fleet of ageing Harrier jump jet aircraft.

The MOD later decided that DARA&#x27;s &#x27;fast jets&#x27; and engines businesses would close by April 2007, although the &#x27;large aircraft&#x27; business would continue. On 14 April 2005, the Project Red Dragon super-hangar opened and DARA moved its VC10 operations from its existing &#x27;Twin Peaks&#x27; hangar into the new facility. A 2009 report from the National Audit Office concluded that &quot;The MOD and the Welsh Authorities did not work sufficiently closely during the project. Although they had complementary objectives, there was no common purpose between them, with the MOD interested in securing more efficient repair of fast jets and the Welsh Authorities interested in safeguarding and creating jobs in South Wales. The MOD and the Welsh Authorities did not have a shared understanding of each other’s key assumptions. The Red Dragon project highlights the danger in large and complex projects that involve multiple public bodies of insufficient openness and information sharing.&quot;

=== MOD St Athan ===
In 2006, the Special Forces Support Group was raised at St Athan and the Welsh Guards returned to London. The station was renamed as Ministry of Defence St Athan (MOD St Athan). A large swathe of land was acquired by the Welsh Government and commercial aircraft companies such as ATC Lasham started to operate from buildings such as the former VC10 hangars. DARA steadily drew down their &#x27;fast jet&#x27; and engines operations, closing both by April 2007; the &#x27;large aircraft&#x27; business continued as part of the Defence Support Group (DSG) until its closure in 2012.

In 2009, building work was due to commence on a new defence training academy with its heart at St Athan. This had followed the Defence Training Review, when three companies tendered for two separate contracts, with the Metrix consortium being awarded the contract for package 1 (package 2 was later withdrawn). The Welsh Government then reintroduced its original plans to create an aviation business park, including the site in the St Athan and Cardiff Airport Enterprise Zone. Bruce Dickinson set up Cardiff Aviation Lt. in the former VC10 hangars known as Twin Peaks. In addition, eCube (specialising in scrapping aircraft), together with Horizon Aircraft Services (formerly Hunter Flying) (MRO of military aircraft) took up occupation.

The training to be carried out at St Athan was to be specialist phase 2 and phase 3 engineering courses of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force. They include those courses delivered today within the Defence Colleges of Aeronautical Engineering, Electro-Mechanical Engineering and Communications and Information Systems. Phase 2 training involves initial trade training for the armed forces; phase 3 training involves continuous professional development. In addition, some training of overseas troops in the same disciplines was to be accommodated.

The new academy was expected to create up to 5,000 jobs at St Athan, with a £14 billion investment over 25 years and an estimated £57.4 million spent into the local economy. It was to accept its first intakes in 2012 and was to be fully operational in 2017 when the last of the current training centres closed. However, changes in all these elements of the plans were brought out by anti-Metrix campaigners. Phase 3 training was deleted with reduction to a PFI total of £11 billion, the &#x27;academy&#x27; was downgraded to a Defence Training College, the number of jobs was halved and most disclosed as not created but transferred from other MOD sites. A principal member of the Metrix consortium (the &#x27;blue-chip&#x27; Land Securities Trillium) withdrew, to be replaced by Sodexo. A public inquiry into compulsory purchase of land opened in January 2009 gave opportunity for local communities and Welsh organisations (Cynefin y Werin; Friends of the Earth, Cymdeithas y Cymod, Green Party) to challenge the development. The MOD and Welsh Government accepted the size was cut by more than half, but maintained their demand for the same size of estate for accommodation and support facilities. They also retained the environmentally damaging and costly approach road, though opposed strongly by local communities. Being politically sensitive, the decision on the inquiry was held up for 18 months.

The MOD continued to negotiate the project with the Metrix consortium, but the price rose several times, reaching £14 billion in mid-2009. The decision was delayed till after the 2010 election. Then, on 19 October 2010, the DTR project was cancelled and Metrix UK lost its status as preferred bidder. On 18 July 2011, the Minister announced that MoD Lyneham would instead be used as an integrated training centre.

The last aircraft to be serviced at DSG St Athan, a Vickers VC10, departed the site on 23 February 2012 and the last remaining employees were made redundant.

On 23 February 2016, Aston Martin announced that their new factory to build its DBX crossover model would be built on the airfield at St Athan. Construction of the site would commence in 2017, with a total investment of $280 million and the creation of 750 jobs. The factory will incorporate the Project Red Dragon super-hangar which had cost the British taxpayer £113m. The U.S. state of Alabama, along with two UK sites and a Middle Eastern location, had been on Aston&#x27;s shortlist for the factory. Aston unveiled the DBX at the 2015 Geneva Auto Show; DBX production was to start in 2020 with an output of up to 5,000 units a year envisaged.

The airfield part of the site was transferred from military to civilian control on 1 April 2019. It is now owned by the Welsh Government and known as Bro Tathan airfield, and is home to Bro Tathan Business Park. Bro Tathan North is currently home to the South Wales Aviation Museum. The military continues to have a presence adjacent to the airfield, which is known as MOD St Athan.

In December 2020, the last ever flight of a British Airways Boeing 747-400, registration G-BYGC, landed at St Athan, having departed nearby Cardiff Airport, where it had been stored. This aircraft is painted in the heritage BOAC livery, and will be preserved, along with two of its sister aircraft that were sent to Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, and another which was sent to Cotswold Airport in Gloucestershire.

==Current units==
Units currently based at MOD St Athan include:

Strategic Command

*Special Forces Support Group

== Future ==

=== Relocation of No. 4 School of Technical Training ===
There was an intention to move No 4. School of Technical Training (No. 4 SoTT) from St Athan to MoD Lyneham as the Army (REME) schools that are relocating there carry out similar engineering training functions; however, a decision by 22 Training Group to keep capbadges together (RAF with RAF) seems to have changed the direction of No. 4 SoTT, with it now potentially moving to RAF Cosford to rationalise the Defence College of Technical Training (DCTT) training establishments, a move confirmed in an announcement by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon on 15 September 2015.

In October 2017, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) stated the plans to move No. 4 SoTT were not sufficiently mature to provide a date for the move. The MOD indicated in September 2019 that the intent remains to relocate the school before the lease on its buildings expires in March 2024. The future location and time-frame to relocate the school was yet to be finalised.

==Air accidents==

On 26 August 1993 an ATC civilian instructor was seriously injured and the RAF Volunteer Reserve pilot, Group Captain Roger Sweatman, was killed when their Chipmunk trainer, on an air experience flight, crashed after encountering difficulties during a simulated emergency low-height manoeuvre on take-off. The pilot attempted to recover the aircraft in a reciprocal approach; however, it struck the roof of the engine repair and overhaul squadron hangar and crashed to the ground at the foot of the adjacent hangar. The accident was investigated by an air crash investigation team and was attributed to pilot error.

Just before 1100 GMT on 11 February 2009, two Grob Tutor aircraft flying out of St Athan were involved in a mid-air collision in which two Air Training Corps cadets and their instructors, both RAF pilots, died. With the cause of the incident uncertain, three separate enquiries were undertaken, including one by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. The AAIB investigation report, published on 3 November 2010, concluded that the two aircraft simply failed to see each other due to obstructions on the canopy structure and the relative size and lack of conspicuity of the aircraft. The two cadet passengers were cousins and were named as Katie Jo Davies, 14, and Nikitta Walters, 13; the RAF pilots were named as Flying Officer Hylton Price and Flight Lieutenant Andrew Marsh.

==In media==
The proximity of the BBC production facility at Roath Lock (and previously Upper Boat Studios) makes St. Athan a popular choice for location shooting, and it has appeared in such TV programmes as &quot;Torchwood&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;, and also in the films &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; and &quot;Mr Nice&quot;.

<text>Princeton Theological Seminary (PTSem), officially The Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian Church, is a private school of theology in Princeton, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Established in 1812, it is the second-oldest seminary in the United States, founded under the auspices of Archibald Alexander, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). It is also the largest of ten seminaries associated with the Presbyterian Church.

The seminary operates the largest theological library in the United States and the second largest in the world (after the Vatican in Rome). It maintains a number of special collections, including the Karl Barth Research Collection in the Center for Barth Studies. The seminary also manages an endowment of $1.459 billion in 2022, making it the third-wealthiest institution of higher learning in the state of New Jersey—after Princeton University and Rutgers University. 

Princeton Seminary has been home to many leading biblical scholars, theologians, and clergy among its faculty and alumni. In the 1980s, it enrolled about 900 students, but as of Fall 2023, the seminary enrolls approximately 276 FTE students. While around 26 percent of them are candidates for ministry specifically in the Presbyterian Church, the majority are completing such candidature in other denominations, pursuing careers in academia across a number of different disciplines, or receiving training for other, non-theological fields altogether.

The Seminary holds academic reciprocity with Princeton University as well as the Westminster Choir College of Rider University, New Brunswick Theological Seminary, Jewish Theological Seminary, and the Rutgers School of Social Work.

==History==

The plan to establish a theological seminary in Princeton was in the interests of advancing and extending the theological curriculum. The educational intention was to go beyond the liberal arts course by setting up a postgraduate, professional school in theology. The plan met with enthusiastic approval on the part of authorities at the College of New Jersey, later to become Princeton University, for they were coming to see that specialized training in theology required more attention than they could give. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church established the Theological Seminary at Princeton, New Jersey, in 1812, with the support of the directors of the nearby College of New Jersey, as the second graduate theological school in the United States. The seminary remains an institution of the Presbyterian Church (USA), being the largest of the ten theological seminaries affiliated with the 1.1-million-member denomination.

In 1812, the seminary had three students and Archibald Alexander was its first professor. By 1815 the number of students had gradually increased and work began on a building: Alexander Hall was designed by John McComb Jr., a New York architect, and opened in 1817. The original cupola was added in 1827, but it burned in 1913 and was replaced in 1926. The building was simply called &quot;Seminary&quot; until 1893, when it was officially named Alexander Hall. Since its founding, Princeton Seminary has graduated approximately 14,000 men and women who have served the church in many capacities, from pastoral ministry and pastoral care to missionary work, Christian education and leadership in the academy and business.

The seminary became known during the 19th and early 20th centuries for its defense of Calvinistic Presbyterianism, a tradition that became known as Princeton Theology and greatly influenced Evangelicalism during the period. Some of the institution&#x27;s figures active in this movement included Charles Hodge, B.B. Warfield, J. Gresham Machen, and Geerhardus Vos.

===Liberalism and split===
In response to the increasing influence of theological liberalism in the 1920s and the fundamentalist–modernist controversy at the institution, several theologians left to form the Westminster Theological Seminary under the leadership of J. Gresham Machen.

The college was later the center of the fundamentalist–modernist controversy of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929, the seminary was reorganized along modernist lines, and in response, Machen, along with three of his colleagues: Oswald T. Allis, Robert Dick Wilson and Cornelius Van Til, resigned, with Machen, Allis and Wilson founding Westminster Theological Seminary in Glenside, Pennsylvania. In 1958, Princeton became a seminary of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., following a merger between the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the United Presbyterian Church of North America, and in 1983, it would become a seminary of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) after the merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.

===Ties to slavery===

In 2019, the seminary announced that it would spend $27 million on &quot;scholarships and other initiatives to address its historical ties to slavery&quot;.

=== 2022 President ===
The Rev. Jonathan Lee Walton was announced to become the next president of Princeton Theological Seminary, with his tenure to begin on January 1, 2023. He was the first Black president to be named to the role since the establishment of the seminary in 1812.

==Academics==
Princeton Theological Seminary has been accredited by the Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) since 1938 and by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education since 1968.

===Degree programs===
* Master of Divinity (M.Div.)
* Masters of Arts (MA)
* Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS)
* Master of Theology (Th.M.)
* Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), offered from 1975 to 2005, having been replaced with Ph.D. in Practical Theology
* Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), although the Doctor of Theology was previously awarded
* Dual M.Div./MA in Christian Education with foci in Youth &amp; Young Adults, Teaching Ministry, or Spiritual Development
*Dual M.Div./MSW in partnership with Rutgers School of Social Work

===Libraries===

The Wright Library is a destination for visiting scholars from around the world. The current library building was completed in 2013 and was renamed on October 13, 2021, after Theodore S. Wright, the first African American to graduate from Princeton Theological Seminary. The library has over 1,252,503 bound volumes, pamphlets, and microfilms. It receives about 2,100 journals, annual reports of church bodies and learned societies, bulletins, transactions, and periodically issued indices, abstracts, and bibliographies. The Libraries are:
* Princeton Theological Seminary Library (&quot;The Wright Library&quot;) was opened in 2013 and holds the bulk of the seminary&#x27;s collection. The library is also home to the Center for Barth Studies, the Reigner Reading Room, and special collections including the Abraham Kuyper collection of Dutch Reformed Protestantism and personal libraries of theologians like Ashbel Green, William Buell Sprague, Joseph Addison Alexander, Alexander Balloch Grosart, William Henry Green, Samuel Miller, and B. B. Warfield.
* Speer Library was opened in 1957 and named in honor of the renowned missionary statesman Robert E. Speer. It was closed in late 2010 and was replaced by the new library.
* Henry Luce III Library, dedicated in 1994 and named in honor of a distinguished trustee, Henry W. Luce, has 350,000 volumes and 250 readers. This library merged with Wright Library in 2013.

===Rankings===
Given its status as an autonomous postgraduate institution, Princeton Seminary does not appear in most global or national rankings for universities and colleges. As a graduate school, however, it does see such ranking on occasion. In 2020, it was ranked #53 nationwide – tied with University of Iowa and University of Florida – for the field of history by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. It was also rated at A+ by the American rankings and review company Niche in 2020. The journal &quot;First Things&quot;, an organ of the Institute on Religion and Public Life in New York, ranked Princeton Seminary fifth among American graduate programs in theology, in 2012.

==Student life==
In 2021, 114 degrees were awarded, 52.6% to women, and 47.4% to men.

===Seminary Chapel===

Built in 1834, Princeton Seminary&#x27;s chapel was named to honor Samuel Miller, the second professor at the seminary. It was designed in the Greek Revival style by Charles Steadman, who also designed the nearby Nassau Presbyterian Church. Originally located beside Alexander Hall, it was moved in 1933 toward the center of the campus, its steps now leading down onto the seminary&#x27;s main quad. Miller Chapel underwent a complete renovation in 2000, with the addition of the Joe R. Engle Organ.

On January 18, 2022, members of the Association of Black Seminarians physically removed the sign naming the chapel &quot;Miller Chapel&quot; and held a protest calling for the trustees to rename the chapel because of Samuel Miller&#x27;s direct ties to slavery. On January 25, 2022, the Board of Trustees of Princeton Seminary voted to rename Miller Chapel in light of the protest. &quot;This decision followed thoughtful deliberation by the Board of Trustees, and it is part of their commitment to the ongoing work of confession and repentance that was part of the historical audit on slavery.&quot;

===Navigating the Waters===
In 2011, Princeton Theological Seminary&#x27;s Office of Multicultural Relations and The Kaleidoscope Institute worked together to initiate an effort known as &quot;Navigating the Waters&quot;, a program designed to promote cultural proficiency and diversity competency in faculty, staff, and students.

==Research==
===Center for Barth Studies===

The Center for Barth Studies was established at Princeton Seminary in 1997 and is administered by a board of seminary faculty. The Center sponsors conferences, research opportunities, discussion groups, and publications that seek to advance understanding of the theology of Karl Barth (1886–1968), the German Swiss professor and pastor widely regarded as the greatest theologian of the 20th century. The Karl Barth Research Collection, part of Special Collections in the Princeton Theological Seminary Libraries, supports the scholarly activities of the Center for Barth Studies. The Karl Barth Research Collection is acquiring a collection of writings by and about Karl Barth. Although many volumes are still needed, the Research Collection has already acquired Barth&#x27;s most important works in German and English, several first editions, and an original hand-written manuscript by Karl Barth.

===Abraham Kuyper Center for Public Theology===
The key aspect of the Abraham Kuyper Center for Public Theology is the Abraham Kuyper Collection of Dutch Reformed Protestantism in the library&#x27;s Special Collections, which focuses on the theology and history of Dutch Reformed Protestantism since the nineteenth century and features a sizable assemblage of primary and secondary sources by and about Abraham Kuyper. The center maintains in partnership with the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam an online database of secondary literature about Abraham Kuyper.

The center has also established an annual event organized to award the Abraham Kuyper Prize for Excellence in Reformed Theology and Public Life, during which the recipient delivers an address. The Abraham Kuyper Consultation, a series of further lectures, takes place on the following day.

In 2017, there was a controversy surrounding the plan to award the Kuyper Prize to Tim Keller, then Pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City. A group of students and faculty protested that Keller should not receive the award due to his non-affirming views regarding LGBTQ and women clergy. President Barnes initially defended awarding Keller the prize before changing his position. Keller withdrew himself from consideration for the prize and still delivered his lecture. While drawing support from some quarters, the decision to not award Keller the prize also drew criticism in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Washington Post&quot;.

===Center of Theological Inquiry===
In 1978, Princeton Theological Seminary&#x27;s Board of Trustees established the Center of Theological Inquiry (&quot;CTI&quot;&#x27;) as an independent, ecumenical institution for advanced theological research, &quot;to inquire into the relationship between theological disciplines, [and of these with] ... both human and natural sciences, to inquire into the relationship between diverse religious traditions ..., to inquire into the present state of religious consciousness in the modern world, and to examine such other facets of religion in the modern world as may be appropriate ...&quot; Today, the center has its own board, funding, mission and staff, yet maintains close relations with Princeton Theological Seminary. The present director is William Storrar and the associate director is Joshua Mauldin.

===Journals===

&quot;Theology Today&quot; is a peer-reviewed, quarterly journal of Christian theology founded in 1944.

&quot;Koinonia Journal&quot; is published annually by doctoral students at Princeton Theological Seminary. The publication and its annual forum promote written and face-to-face interdisciplinary discussion about issues in theology and the study of religion. It is distributed to well over 100 libraries worldwide.

&quot;Princeton Theological Review&quot; is a student-run, annual and online journal that exists to serve students within the Princeton Theological Seminary body as well as the wider theological community. It is distributed to well over 100 libraries worldwide.

===Seminary Lectureships===

* Abraham Kuyper Lecture and Prize, held in April. In 2017, Princeton Theological Seminary reversed its decision to award the Kuyper Prize to Tim Keller after a group of alumni voiced their objection to the choice due to Keller belonging to a denomination (Presbyterian Church in America) that ordain neither women nor practicing homosexuals. However, the seminary did allow Keller to deliver the Kuyper Lecture without receiving the Kuyper Prize.

<text>Blaufränkisch (; German for &quot;blue Frankish&quot;) is a dark-skinned variety of grape used for red wine. Blaufränkisch, which is a late-ripening variety, produces red wines which are typically rich in tannin and may exhibit a pronounced spicy character.

The grape is grown across Central Europe, including Austria, Czech Republic (in particular southern Moravia where it is known as &quot;Frankovka&quot;), Germany, Slovakia (where it is known as Frankovka modrá), Croatia, Serbia (&quot;frankovka&quot;), Slovenia (known as &quot;modra frankinja&quot;), and Italy (&quot;Franconia&quot;). In Hungary the grape is called &quot;Kékfrankos&quot; (also lit. blue Frankish) and is grown in a number of wine regions including Sopron, Villány, Szekszárd, and Eger (where it is a major ingredient in the famous red wine blend known as &quot;Egri Bikavér&quot; (lit. Bull&#x27;s Blood) having largely replaced the Kadarka grape). It has been called &quot;the Pinot noir of the East&quot; because of its spread and reputation in Eastern Europe. In America the grape is also known as Lemberger, &quot;Blauer Limberger&quot; or &quot;Blue Limberger&quot; and grown in Pennsylvania, Washington state, Michigan, New Jersey, Idaho, New York, Colorado, Ohio, Virginia. and California,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alpen Cellars - LEMBERGER / BLAUFRANKISH&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA profiling has shown that Blaufränkisch is a cross between Gouais blanc (Weißer Heunisch; male parent) and Blaue Zimmettraube (female parent; the offspring of Blauer Gänsfüsser). Historical sources of grapevine classification have provided very solid evidence that the geographic area of origin of the variety is Lower Styria (today Slovenian Styria). For a long time before the application of DNA analysis, Blaufränkisch was erroneously thought to be a clone of the Gamay grape variety, due to certain similarities in morphology and possibly due to its name &quot;Gamé&quot; in Bulgaria.

The German name Lemberger derives from the fact that it was imported to Germany in the 19th century from Lemberg in Lower Styria in present-day Slovenia and then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. An 1877 export of &quot;Lembergerreben&quot; to Germany has been recorded. The almost identical name Limberger refers to Limburg at Maissau in Lower Austria, where in the late 19th century &quot;ungrafted Limberg Blaufränkisch vines&quot; (&quot;wurzelechte Limberger Blaufränkisch-Reben&quot;) were offered for sale.

==History and origins==

While the first officially documented appearance of Blaufränkisch did not occur until 1862 when the grape was included in a viticultural exposition in Vienna, Austria, it is likely that the grape is much older and has perhaps been around as long as the Middle Ages under a variety of Fränkisch synonyms. The term Fränkisch itself comes from Franconia, the German wine region that includes northwest Bavaria, the northeastern reaches of Baden-Württemberg around Heilbronn-Franken, and parts of southern Thuringia. During the Middle Ages, the wine from this region was highly praised, and grapes that were thought to be capable of producing superior wines were called &quot;Fränkisch&quot; to distinguish them from the less highly prized Hunnic grapes. It is likely that from sometime during this period up until the 1900s, Blaufränkisch (literally &quot;Blue Frankish&quot;) began to be grown in the region.

Despite the close association to Franconia, ampelographers believe that the grape likely originated somewhere in a swath of land stretching from Dalmatia through Austria and Hungary. They base this belief on the proliferation of synonyms originating from these areas as well as DNA evidence showing that the old Hungarian wine grape &quot;Kékfrankos&quot; was, in fact, Blaufränkisch, and that Gouais blanc (Weisser Heunisch) and an unknown grape variety are the parent varieties of Blaufränkisch. Despite its French name, it has been speculated that Gouais blanc has Eastern European origins, with the term &quot;Heunisch&quot; thought to derive from the Huns, and Gouais blanc being confirmed as a parent variety of another old Hungarian wine grape Furmint, but ultimately the exact birthplace of both Gouais blanc and Blaufränkisch are unknown.

The synonyms &quot;Lemberger&quot; and &quot;Limberger&quot; first appeared in literature near the end of the 19th century in relation to the grape&#x27;s believed origins from the Austro-Hungarian cities of Lemberg (today in modern Slovenia) and Limberg (today known as Maissau) in Lower Austria. In 1875, the International Ampelographic Commission in Colmar, France adopted Blaufränkisch as an officially sanctioned name.

==Viticulture==

The Blaufränkisch vine is known as an early budding variety that can be susceptible to early spring frost. It is a late ripening variety, and tends to be planted in warmer vineyard sites. Among the viticultural hazards that Blaufränkisch is most prone to are powdery and downy mildews.

Blaufränkisch is considered a high productive vine capable of producing high yields fairly easily. In some parts of Europe it is not uncommon to see it harvested at . However over-cropping the vine has a tendency to produce thin wines with many green, weedy notes.

==Wine regions==
Today Blaufränkisch is planted across the globe from Japan, the United States and Australia to Germany, Hungary and Austria.

===Austria===

It is possible that Blaufränkisch or a similar forerunner of the grape was already cultivated in regions of present Austria (Lower Austria and Burgenland) in the 10th century. In his 1777 publication &quot;Beschreibung der in der Wiener Gegend gemeinen Weintrauben-Arten&quot;, ampelographer Sebastian Helbling accounted the variety as one of the best red grape varieties of Lower Austria, and used the name &quot;Schwarze Fränkische&quot; for it.

In present-day Austria Blaufränkisch is the second most important red grape variety after Zweigelt, with , representing 6% of all Austrian plantings in 2008. The vast majority of these plantings are in the Burgenland region of eastern Austria. It is particularly common in Mittelburgenland, with planted in 2008, an area sometimes given the nickname &quot;Blaufränkischland&quot;. The Mittelburgenland is considered ideal for the grape due to the dry warm winds from the east across the Pannonian Plain, and the sheltering influence of the hill regions to the north, south and west of the region.

Outside the Burgenland, of Blaufränkisch were planted in the Neusiedlersee region, and were planted in the Neusiedlersee-Hügelland region in the hill country bordering the lake. The wines produced in this region, influenced by the warm moderating climate of the lake, tend to be, as described by wine expert and Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, &quot;richer and more full bodied&quot;, while the clay vineyard soils south of the lake in the Südburgenland tend to produce wines with more spice notes.

In the Carnuntum area located between Vienna and the Neusiedlersee, the slate-based soils near the city of Spitzerberg are also home to some Blaufränkisch plantings.

====Districtus Austriae Controllatus and wine styles====

Within Austria Blaufränkisch is a permitted variety in several &quot;Districtus Austriae Controllatus&quot; (DAC) zones. Producers in the Burgenland tend to delineate light bodied, unoaked Blaufränkisch wines to the &quot;Mittleburgenland DAC Classic&quot;, while labeling more full bodied, oaked styles as &quot;Burgenland DAC Reserve&quot;.

In the Eisnberg DAC of the southern Südburgenland, the grape is grown in iron-rich soils and tends to produce a distinctive varietal style. In the Leithaberg DAC situated in the slate and limestone hills around the Leitha Mountains, Blaufränkisch must make up at least 85% of the blend, with St. Laurent, Zweigelt or Pinot noir permitted to round out the remaining portion. In this cooler climate wine region the Blaufränkisch tends to be, as described by Robinson, &quot;nervy and elegant&quot;.

In Austria, Blaufränkisch tends to produce deeply colored wines with dark fruit aromas, peppery spice notes and moderate to high acidity. Depending on where it is produced the wine can be unoaked, or spend some time aging in the barrel. The unoaked styles tend to be lighter bodied while the oaked versions tend to be fuller bodied.

=== Other European wine regions ===
In Germany, there are of Blaufränkisch, grown primarily in the Württemberg wine region around the town of Stuttgart. Here, where the grape is often known as &quot;Blauer Lemberger&quot; or &quot;Blauer Limberger&quot;, the grape tends to make more light bodied wines with softer tannins than the style typically made in Austria.

Blaufränkisch, known here as &quot;Frankovka&quot;, is the second most widely grown red grape variety in the Czech Republic. It is grown only in the Moravian wine subregions due to its late-ripening nature. Almost 9% of the total vineyard area in Slovakia () is planted to Blaufränkisch, where the grape is more widely known as &quot;Frankovka modrá&quot;. In the city of Bratislava, specifically the suburb of Rača, local wine producers hold an annual wine festival that highlights Frankovka modrá wines from the region as well as examples of Blaufränkisch from around the globe.
In Hungary, the grape is known as &quot;Kékfrankos&quot; (literally &quot;Blue Frankish&quot;) and &quot;Nagyburgundi&quot;. There are more than of the variety planted throughout the country, particularly around Sopron near the Austrian border of Burgenland, and Eger and Kunság in central Hungary. In the Eger region, Kékfrankos has displaced Kadarka in several modern incarnations of Egri Bikaver &quot;(Bull’s Blood)&quot;.

In Slovenia, the grape is known as &quot;Modra Frankinja&quot;. At present, there are 2,759,316 reeds of Blue Frankish that are planted in Slovenia, which grow on almost 700 hectares of wine-growing areas. This represents 4.68 percent of all plantations in the country. The variety of Blue Frankish is spread in two wine-growing regions Podravje and Posavje. It&#x27;s the fourth most common variety of red grapes in Slovenia. 

Blaufränkisch goes by the name &quot;Burgund Mare&quot; in Romania, where most of the variety&#x27;s are located in the southern wine regions of Ștefănești and Dealu Mare. In recent years, plantings of the grape have expanded eastward towards warmer vineyard sites near the Black Sea. In Bulgaria, for many years the Blaufränkisch plantings in the country, known as &quot;Gamé&quot;, were thought to be the Gamay noir grape grown in the Beaujolais wine region of France until DNA evidence proved that it was in fact Blaufränkisch.

In Croatia, the nearly of Blaufränkisch, known as &quot;Frankovka&quot;, represent around 2.7% of all Croatian vineyard plantings. This number is expected to rise, as many plantings previously thought to be a different variety, &quot;Borgonja&quot;, have now been proven by DNA testing to be Blaufränkisch. Most of the Croatian plantings are found in the Kontinentalna Hrvatska (Continental Croatia) region in the northwestern part of the country and on the Istrian peninsula along the Adriatic Sea. In Serbia, most of the plantings of Blaufränkisch are found in the province of Vojvodina.

In Italy, the grape is known as &quot;Franconia Nera&quot;, with planted mostly in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine regions of the Friuli Isonzo and Friuli Latisana &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot;. In Spain, some experimental plantings of Blaufränkisch are found in the Spanish wine region of Málaga and Sierras de Málaga, where a German-descended winemaker is making varietal wines under the synonym &quot;Lemberger&quot;.

===New World wine regions===

In the New World Blaufränkisch is found in the Australian wine region of the Adelaide Hills, where a single grower, Hahndorf Hill, has been growing this variety for the past 20 years to make a full-bodied version of this wine. Other producers in Australia have recently planted Blaufränkisch and will soon be presenting their own versions. In Canada, there are some plantings of the variety in Ontario in the Niagara region, British Columbia wine regions of Vancouver Island, Nova Scotia, and the Okanagan Valley.

The grape can be found across the United States, from the Finger Lakes, Cayuga Lake, Hudson River Region and Long Island AVAs in New York, where it often blended with Cabernet franc, to California, (particularly the Lodi and Temecula Valley AVAs) and Washington State. In Pennsylvania, varietal and blended wines are produced in the Lake Erie (which also includes Ohio and New York) and Lehigh Valley AVAs. The Snake River Valley AVA in Idaho is home to a few hectares of the grape. Blaufränkisch has recently been making strides in New Jersey, specifically in the Outer Coastal Plain AVA, becoming a stand out grape for this region. Additional plantings are found in New Mexico, Virginia in both the Shenandoah Valley and Monticello AVAs at Hazy Mountain&#x27;s two vineyard sites, Rhode Island, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Colorado and the greater Southeastern New England AVA.

In Canada, Lemberger is found in several planting in the Niagara Peninsula DVA.

====Washington Lemberger====

The grape has a long history in Washington State, where it known mostly as Lemberger. Here the grape has been used to produce a variety of styles from light bodied claret-style blends, higher bodied more alcoholic &quot;Zinfandel-like&quot; wines to port style fortified wines. The grape was a favorite of Dr. Walter Clore, the &quot;father of Washington wine&quot;. He encouraged the grape&#x27;s planting throughout the Yakima Valley AVA in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1976, John Williams of Kiona Vineyard in what is now the Red Mountain AVA planted a few hectares that would be used in 1980 to make the first commercial Lemberger wine produced in Washington.

As of 2011 there were of the variety planted throughout the Columbia Valley AVA, including Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA, Champoux Vineyard (which along with Kiona and Red Willow has some of the oldest Lemberger vines in the state) and Destiny Ridge Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, with additional plantings in the Rattlesnake Hills and Columbia Gorge AVAs.

Despite the grape&#x27;s history, winemakers have had a difficult time marketing the grape due to consumers&#x27; association of the name &quot;Lemberger&quot; with the smelly cheese of a similar name. Some winemakers have taken the approach of California winemaker Jed Steele who, in partnership with Chateau Ste. Michelle, makes a Washington Blaufränkisch that he labels under the proprietary name &quot;Blue Franc&quot; to avoid using the names Lemberger or Blaufränkisch which have also not fared well among consumers.

According to wine expert Paul Gregutt, Washington Lembergers are characterized by their &quot;blood red&quot; color, with light peppery spice aromas and flavors of ripe berry fruit.

== Wines and food pairings ==

Blaufränkisch wines have aromas of dark ripe cherries and dark berries, are spicy, have medium tannin levels and sometimes very good acidity. Young wines are deeply fruity and become more velvety, supple and complex with age.

According to wine expert Oz Clarke, well made examples of Blaufränkisch will have notes of red currants and blackberry fruit. The grape does have the potential to have high tannins and acidity levels which can be moderated by harvest decisions and some oak aging. However, Clarke notes that wines from Blaufränkisch can take on too much oak flavoring and come across as excessively oaky. When blended with other varieties, Blaufränkisch often contributes acidity and structure to the blend.

In food and wine pairings, Blaufränkisch/Lemberger are often paired with lamb dishes and grilled meats.

==Offspring and relationship to other varieties==
At one time it was believed that Blaufränkisch was a clone of the Gamay grape of Beaujolais, due in part to the prevalence of the synonym Gamé used in Bulgaria, and perhaps because it was thought that there was a parent-offspring relationship between the two. However, in the 21st century DNA evidence showed that Blaufränkisch was an offspring of Gouais blanc and an unknown parent, making it a half-sibling to Gamay as well as other varieties of grapes which have Gouais blanc as a parent such as Chardonnay, Riesling, Elbling, Aramon noir, Grolleau noir, Muscadelle and Colombard.
Blaufränkisch is a parent to Zweigelt, the most widely planted red grape in Austria, from a crossing with St. Laurent (also known as &quot;Sankt Laurent&quot;) done in 1922 by Dr. Fritz Zweigelt at the Klosterneuburg research facilities in Vienna. This same Blaufränkisch x Sankt Laurent pairing was used to produce the Czech/Slovak grape André. Dr. Zweigelt also crossed Blaufränkisch with Blauer Portugieser to produce Blauburger, with August Herold using the same pairing to produce Heroldrebe in 1929 at the Weinsberg research center in Baden-Württemberg. Also at Weinsberg, Blaufränkisch was crossed with Dornfelder to produce Acolon, and with Cabernet Sauvignon to produce both Cabernet Cubin and Cabernet Mitos in 1970.

In 1951 researchers at the Szent István University in Hungary crossed Blaufränkisch with Kadarka to produce Rubintos. Two years later they crossed the grape with Muscat Bouschet, (an offspring of Petit Bouschet), to produce Magyarfrankos.

In 1986 Blaufränkisch was crossed with Regent at a research facility at Geilweilerhof to produce Reberger.

<text>The Royal Gurkha Rifles (RGR) is a rifle regiment of the British Army, forming part of the Brigade of Gurkhas. Unlike other regiments in the British Army, RGR soldiers are recruited from Nepal, which is neither a dependent territory of the United Kingdom nor a member of the Commonwealth.

==History==

The regiment was formed as the sole Gurkha infantry regiment of the British Army following the consolidation of the four separate Gurkha regiments in 1994:
* 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)
* 6th Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles
* 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles
* 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles

The amalgamations took place as follows:
* 1st Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles; formed by the consolidation of the 1st Bn, 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles and 1st Bn, 6th Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles.
* 2nd Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles; formed by renaming the 1st Bn, 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles.
* 3rd Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles; formed by renaming the 1st Bn, 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles.

The 3rd Battalion was consolidated with the 2nd Battalion in 1996 as part of run down of British forces in Hong Kong.

The Gurkhas in general and the direct predecessors of the Royal Gurkha Rifles in particular are considered to be among the finest infantrymen in the world, as is evidenced by the high regard they are held in for both their fighting skill, and their smartness of turnout on parade.

In December 1995, Lieutenant-Colonel Bijaykumar Rawat became the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, the first Nepalese to become a battalion commander in the RGR. He oversaw the departure of the battalion from Hong Kong just before that city&#x27;s transfer to Chinese control, and the battalion&#x27;s relocation to Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Church Crookham in 1996.

Twice during its most recent Brunei posting the 2nd Battalion was deployed as the Afghanistan Roulement Infantry Battalion, while the 1st Battalion deployed as part of 52 Infantry Brigade in late 2007. During this tour, Cornet Harry Wales (Prince Harry) was attached for a period to the 1st Battalion as a Forward Air Controller.

Under Army 2020, the regiment was intended to provide two light role battalions, rotating between Brunei and the UK, with their higher unit as 11th Infantry Brigade. However, in June 2015, the 2nd Battalion, then based in the UK, was reassigned to form part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, in the air assault infantry role.

In 2018, the UK Government announced that it intended to recruit more than 800 new posts to the Brigade of Gurkhas. Approximately 300 of these are planned for the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which was to see the formation of a new battalion planned for the specialist infantry role. On 11 March 2019, the Minister for the Armed Forces confirmed that the 3rd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles would be reestablished, with recruitment starting in 2019. The battalion was reformed on 31 January 2020, to be based initially at Shorncliffe before moving to Aldershot. However, following the revised &quot;Future Soldier (British Army)&quot; reorganisation, the formation of the 3rd Battalion was cancelled, with instead a number of independent companies established to reinforce units across the British Army. The first formed unit, Coriano Company, was subsequently followed by a second, Falklands Company, which was attached to 2nd Battalion, The Rangers.

==Organisation==
At any one time, one battalion is based at the British garrison in Brunei as part of Britain&#x27;s commitment to maintaining a military presence in Southeast Asia.

Meanwhile, the other battalion is based at Sir John Moore Barracks, Shorncliffe, near Folkestone in Kent as part of 4th Light Brigade Combat Team, and is available for deployment to most areas in Europe and Africa.

1 RGR and 2 RGR rotate between Brunei and Folkestone, typically every 3 years.

Coriano Company and Falklands Company operate as part of the Army Special Operations Brigade providing training, mentoring and operational support for indigenous forces in partner nations, and is based in Aldershot Garrison. A third special operations company was formed in September 2024, becoming the first Gurkha unit to be stationed in Northern Ireland.

===Training companies===
In addition to the operational battalions, three further units are cap badged as Royal Gurkha Rifles:
* Gurkha Company (Sittang)
* Gurkha Wing (Mandalay)
* Gurkha Company (Tavoleto)

These three are formed as operational training units at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the Infantry Battle School and the Land Warfare Centre, to provide opposing forces for realistic battle simulation.

===Gurkha clerks===
Prior to 2011, administrative support for the entire Brigade of Gurkhas was provided by specially trained personnel called Gurkha clerks, who wore the cap badge of the Royal Gurkha Rifles. In June 2011, the Gurkha clerks were amalgamated into a single company sized unit called the Gurkha Staff and Personnel Support Company (GSPS), which was incorporated as part of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps. As with the other Gurkha support units (Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Engineers, Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Signals, Queen&#x27;s Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment), the GSPS received its own cap badge based on the badge of its parent corps.

==Ranks==

Upon joining the British Army the RGR&#x27;s predecessor regiments adopted British rank titles (e.g. sergeant and corporal) instead of the Indian Army names used before (e.g. havildar and naik). Similarly, the regiments&#x27; Viceroy Commissioned Officers, who were neither commissioned officers nor non-commissioned officers but filled most of the junior officer positions in a battalion, had their titles changed to (King&#x27;s) Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Officer (QGO), e.g. lieutenant (QGO), captain (QGO), major (QGO) instead of the Indian Army ranks of jemadar, subedar, and subedar-major. At the same time, some RGR Gurkha officers had a Queen&#x27;s Commission; they often had a (GCO) suffix after their rank.

Subsequently, on 17 June 2008, the London Gazette published a Supplement that effectively abolished the QGO system by listing every serving QGO officer with their new commissioned rank (e.g. captain (QGO) became captain); the (QGO) and (GCO) suffixes disappeared. Thus, serving Gurkhas, who previously would have become QGO, are now given a British commission and described as &quot;Late Entry.&quot; Direct entry officers can be either British or Nepali (occasionally); they follow the normal British Army training for all direct entry infantry officers. A significant addition to the normal direct entry training for British RGR officers is that they will carry out Nepali language training in Nepal, which culminates in a month-long hike through the Nepalese countryside both to practise their language skills and learn about the country from which their soldiers are recruited.

==Notable soldiers==
Corporal Dip Prasad Pun of the 1st battalion (1 RGR) was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for an act of bravery during the War in Afghanistan in 2010. He alone defended his outpost against a force of up to 12 Taliban fighters. He fired more than 400 rounds, 17 grenades, and one mine. He resorted to fighting with his machine gun tripod after his ammunition had run out.

<doc id="955764" wikidata="Q4790988" url="?curid=955764" title="Aristides (horse)">
<text>Aristides (1872–1893) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse that won the first Kentucky Derby in 1875.

In 1875, the Derby was raced at a mile and a half, the distance it would remain until 1896, when it was changed to its present mile and a quarter. Aristides also had a relative racing in the first Kentucky Derby in 1875.

==Lineage==
A chestnut Thoroughbred with a white star and two hind stockings, Aristides was bred by H. Price McGrath and foaled in 1872. He was sired by the great English stud Leamington, which made him a half brother to another great sire, Hall of Famer Longfellow, who, during his racing career, was called &quot;King of the Turf&quot;. McGrath did not consider Aristides first rate, though his dam (Sarong) was by one of the United States&#x27; greatest sires, Lexington, whose bloodline went back to Glencoe and Hall of Famer Boston.

Aristides (named for his breeder&#x27;s good friend and fellow horse breeder, Pennsylvanian Aristides Welch, who owned Erdenheim Stud and had imported Leamington into the United States) was foaled late in the season and was small, never standing taller than about 15 hands. His stablemate the bay Chesapeake, also sired by Lexington, was expected to do well at the races.

Price McGrath was born to poverty in Jessamine County, Kentucky, and had gone west for the great California Gold Rush. He did well enough to open a gambling house in New York. In a single night, he won $105,000, which allowed him to return to Kentucky and establish a stud farm.

Both Aristides and Chesapeake were born and bred on the McGrathiana Farm in Fayette County, Kentucky, a short distance from Lexington.

==Kentucky Derby==
===African-American success===
Fifteen horses were entered in the first Kentucky Derby, two of them fillies. The track was fast, the weather was fine, and 10,000 people were in attendance. Aristides was one of two horses entered by Price McGrath. The other was Chesapeake. Both horses wore the green and orange silks of H. P. McGrath. Trained by future Hall of Famer Ansel Williamson, an African American, Aristides was ridden by Oliver Lewis, also African-American. McGrath expected the smaller speedball Aristides to be the &quot;rabbit&quot;. He was to go out front fast and force the pace so that Chesapeake, considered the better McGrath horse, could stalk the front runners, and, when they and Aristides tired, come from behind to win.

===The race===
Just as McGrath had planned, Aristides broke in front and took the lead, but McCreery quickly overtook him near the end of the first quarter. Aristides fought back to lead again, followed by McCreery, Ten Broeck, Volcano, and Verdigris. Chesapeake, meanwhile, was almost the last to break and was not doing much at the back of the pack. As the &quot;rabbit&quot;, Aristides kept increasing his lead until there was virtually no chance that Chesapeake could catch up. Aristides&#x27;s jockey, Oliver Lewis, knowing he was not supposed to win, looked to owner McGrath, who waved him on. Both Volcano and Verdigris challenged Aristides in the stretch, but Aristides won by a length and took the $2850 pool. Ten Broeck finished fifth and Chesapeake eighth.

The &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; wrote: &quot;It is the gallant Aristides, heir to a mighty name, that strides with sweeping gallop toward victory...and the air trembles and vibrates again with the ringing cheers that followed.&quot;

==Further races, stud career, breeding record and death==

Aristides, again ridden by Oliver Lewis, came in second in the Belmont Stakes, the race that today is the third race in the Triple Crown of American Thoroughbred horse racing. He also took the Jerome Handicap, the Withers Stakes, the Breckinridge (beating Tom Ochiltree), and a match race over Ten Broeck. He came in second in the Thespian Stakes and the Ocean Hotel Stakes and was third in the Travers Stakes.

On May 10, 1876, Aristides set the fastest time on record for two and an eighth miles at 3:45 1/2 at Lexington, Kentucky. Ten Broeck finished second in this race for four-year-olds.

Aristides raced 21 times with 9 wins, five places, and one show.

Aristides died on June 21, 1893, at the fairgrounds in Chicago. He was sold twice in the two weeks preceding his death. In 1988, the Aristides Stakes was inaugurated at Churchill Downs to honor him. A life-sized bronze statue of Aristides by Carl Regutti stands in the Clubhouse Gardens as a memorial.

==Honors==
In 2024 Aristides was selected for induction into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame by its Historic Review Committee.

<text>Boal is a name given to several varieties of grape cultivated in Portugal, notably in the production of medium-rich fortified wines from Madeira Island. On many wine labels of Madeira wine, the variety&#x27;s name is anglicized as Bual. Bual from Madeira is typically less sweet than that from Malmsey, but more sweet than Sercial or Verdelho. The vines are also common in Portugal and Spain, where the fruit is used in the same way for fortified wines.

==Madeira Boal==
Most of the Boal grown on Madeira is more fully known as Boal Cachudo (a synonym for the Spanish variety Doña Blanca, though the two may be different grapes), which has been shown by DNA profiling to be identical to the Malvasia Fina grown in the Douro valley.

==Notable Boal==
Buckingham Palace holds 25,000 bottles of wine, the oldest being a bottle of bual from 1815.

<text>Jay Chang Joon Kim (; born March 27, 1939) is a Korean-American politician and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California. He was the first Korean American to be elected to the United States Congress.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Jay Kim was born in 1939 in Keijō, Keiki-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan (now Seoul, South Korea). His Korean name, Kim Chang Joon, roughly translates to &quot;golden splendid law.&quot; During the Korean War, his home was destroyed. He immigrated to the United States in 1961. After attending a community college, Kim transferred to the University of Southern California, where he earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in civil engineering. He later earned a doctorate in political science from Hanyang University.

In 1976, Kim started JAYKIM Engineers, a firm that specializes in designing highways and water reclamation projects. He built the business into a firm of 130 employees, with offices in three western states. Kim is an engineer, registered in five western states. JAYKIM Engineers was recognized as one of the top 500 design firms in the country.

==Political career==

===Local politics===
Kim was elected to the city council of Diamond Bar, a newly incorporated suburb of Los Angeles, in 1990 and was elected mayor the following year.

===U.S. House of Representatives (1993–1999)===
Kim was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992 as a Republican from the newly created 41st District, making him the first Korean American elected to the United States Congress.

Kim came under scrutiny for campaign donations, eventually pleading guilty to accepting $230,000 in illegal donations, which amounted to one-third of all donations to his 1992 campaign. At the time, it was a record for campaign violations.

In 1998, he lost the primary election to Gary Miller, with whom he had once served on the Diamond Bar City Council. Miller also won the general election and held the seat until he was elected to the 31st Congressional District in 2012. Kim sought to win election in the 42nd District in 2000. He was defeated in the primary by Elia Pirozzi, who in turn was defeated by incumbent Joe Baca.

==Recent activities==
In recent years, Kim has focused on improving relations and business opportunities between the U.S. and South Korea. He has served as chairman of The Washington Korean-American Forum think tank since 2007. As chairman of Kim Changjoon US-Korea Foundation, he uses his political and professional experience to help develop political leadership in South Korea. The Kim Changjoon Politics and Economy Academy in Korea educates and encourages small business owners to go abroad by providing global market skills and professional knowledge.

With the election of President Park Geun-hye in 2013, Kim was appointed to the National Economic Advisory Council to help small business seek opportunities in the global market. Kim has stated that his &quot;position in both the United States and Korea allows me to encourage economic development between our nations, and the new free-trade agreement lets companies… flourish in new markets.&quot; However, Park was also convicted on public corruption and influence peddling charges, and on 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison in South Korea.

Kim also regularly contributes articles to &quot;The Korea Times&quot;, &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot;, and &quot;The Korea Economic Daily&quot;, and is the honorary Ambassador of Gyeonggi Province.

2021 PyeongChang Peace Forum

The &quot;2021 PyeongChang Peace Forum&quot; took from February 7 to the 10th at the Alpensia Convention Center in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province. On the morning of February 6, one day ahead of the Peace Forum&#x27;s opening ceremony, it had the first Korea-U.S. Leaders Peace Strategy Dialogue session. 
This 1st Korea-U.S. Leaders Peace Dialogue was organized by the Jay Kim Foundation with Gangwon-do, and it was chaired by Professor Kim Woo-sang of Yonsei University. Members of the National Assembly, including Ahn Min-Suk, Lee Sang-min, Hong Young-Pyo from the Majority Party, and Lee Myung-Soo from the People Power Party, participated as a panel. From the U.S. side, the former U.S. Congressman Jay Kim attended the event, and former U.S. Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez and former Congressman Bart Gordon from the Democratic Party attended virtually.
Korean-American Republican Congresswoman Young Kim and Congressman Ami Bera, a Member of the East Asia Pacific subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee, were unable to attend the forum virtually due to a busy schedule, so instead they sent a video clip of congratulatory remarks hoping for the success of the 1st Peace Forum.
A total of six members of the Korea National Assembly and the United States Congress attended the forum to discuss the current status and importance of the South Korea-U.S. alliance, as well as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the importance of the peace exchange with North Korea through sports. Each of them gave five-minute presentations on the topic and discussed various solutions and methods in-depth. 
This event, which will be held every year as part of the PyeongChang Peace Forum, will be expected to contribute to the South Korea-U.S. alliance and a successful Korean Peninsula peace process.

Interview with Gangwon Ilbo on February 7

On the 6th of February, right before the 2021 PyeongChang Peace Forum was held, both former and current Party Members from Korea and the United States gathered at the Alpensia in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province to discuss peace strategies for the Korean Peninsula. This meeting was organized by former US Congressman Jay Kim. Although he was born and raised in Seoul, Kim has a special attachment to Gangwon-do and was appointed as the Honorary Governor of Gangwon-do in 2016. On the 7th of February, at the start of the 2021 Pyeongchang Peace Forum, Gangwon Ilbo (Gangwon-do&#x27;s No.1 newspaper) interviewed Kim while he was spending all his efforts for discussing possible measures for peace for the Korean peninsula.
During the interview with Gang Won Ilbo, Kim presented his idea that Gangwon Winter Youth Olympics&#x27; stimulation would support the Inter-Korean Exchange Plans. He also presented that North Korea&#x27;s current economic difficulties make for a golden time for US-North Korea dialogue, and the U.S. Strategic Perseverance Policy will bring about North Korean Ballistic Missile Provocation. Kim stated, &quot;Peace is not made with words, but made with strength, through consistent efforts for strengthening the alliance between Korea-U.S.&quot;

Article on LA JoongAng Daily Newspaper on February 12

This New Year&#x27;s Eve (Lunar New Year, 2021), former Congressman Jay Kim donated to a charity run by Happy Village (an NGO operated by LA&#x27;s JoongAng Daily newspaper) to serve hot rice cake soups to 300 older people living alone in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="955784" wikidata="Q483421" url="?curid=955784" title="Meluhha">
<text>&#x27; or &#x27; ( ) is the Sumerian name of a prominent trading partner of Sumer during the Middle Bronze Age. Its identification remains an open question, but most scholars associate it with the Indus Valley Civilisation.

==Etymology==
Asko Parpola identifies Proto-Dravidians with the Harappan Culture and the Meluhhan people mentioned in Sumerian records. In his book &quot;Deciphering the Indus Script.&quot; Parpola states that the Brahui people of Pakistan are remnants of the Harappan culture. According to him, the word &quot;Meluhha&quot; derives from the Dravidian words &quot;mel&quot; (&quot;elevated&quot;) and &quot;akam&quot; (&quot;place&quot;). Parpola also relates Meluhha with Balochistan, which he calls the &quot;Proto-Dravidian homeland&quot;. He also relates Meluhha with the transient word Mleccha, a Vedic word used to mean &quot;barbarian&quot; and used by the incoming Aryan speaking population for the native Harappan population.

Another piece of possible evidence that points to the people of Meluhha as being Proto-Dravidian is the fact that sesame oil believed to be exported to Mesopotamia by the Harappans, was known as &quot;ilu&quot; in Sumerian and &quot;eḷḷu&quot; in Akkadian. One theory is that these words derive from the Dravidian word for sesame (&quot;eḷḷ &quot; or &quot;eḷḷu&quot;). However, Michael Witzel, who associates IVC with the ancestors of Munda speakers, suggests an alternative etymology from the para-Munda word for wild sesame: &quot;jar-tila&quot;. Munda is an Austroasiatic language

==Trade with Sumer==


Sumerian texts repeatedly refer to three important centers with which they traded: Magan, Dilmun, and Meluhha. The Sumerian location of Magan is now accepted to be the area currently encompassing the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Dilmun was a Persian Gulf civilization which traded with Mesopotamian civilizations, the current scholarly consensus is that Dilmun encompassed Bahrain, Failaka Island and the adjacent coast of Eastern Arabia in the Persian Gulf.

===Inscriptions===
In an inscription, Sargon of Akkad (2334–2279 BCE) referred to ships coming from Meluhha, Magan and Dilmun. His grandson Naram-Sin (2254–2218 BCE) listing the rebel kings to his rule, mentioned &quot;(..)ibra, man of Melukha&quot;. In an inscription, Gudea of Lagash () referred to the Meluhhans who came to Sumer to sell gold dust, carnelian, etc. In the Gudea cylinders, Gudea mentions that:

In cylinder B, XIV, he mentions his procurement of &quot;blocks of lapis lazuli and bright carnelian from Meluhha&quot;.

Meluhha is also mentioned in mythological legends such as &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot;:

There are no known mentions of Meluhha after 1760 BCE.

====&quot;Meluhha dog&quot;====
In one of his inscriptions, Ibbi-Sin mentions that he received as a tribute from Marhasi a Meluhha red dog:

The qualifier used to describe the dog is , which can be read either &quot;red&quot; as an adjective, or &quot;speckled&quot; as an intransitive verb, and interpretations vary based on these two possible meanings.

It is thought that this &quot;red dog&quot; could be a dhole, also called &quot;Asiatic red dog&quot;, a type of red-colored dog native to southern and eastern Asia.

====Meluhhan trading colony in Sumer====
Towards the end of the Sumerian period, there are numerous mentions in inscriptions of a Meluhha settlement in southern Sumer near the city-state of Girsu. Most of the references seem to date to the Akkadian Empire and especially the Ur III period. The location of the settlement has been tentatively identified with the city of Guabba. The references to &quot;large boats&quot; in Guabba suggests that it may have functioned as a trading colony which initially had direct contact with Meluhha.

It seems that direct trade with Meluhha subsided during the Ur III period, and was replaced by trade with Dilmun, possibly corresponding to the end of urban systems in the Indus Valley around that time.

===Artifacts===
Several Indus seals with Harappan script have been found in Mesopotamia, particularly in Ur, Babylon and Kish. Still, the archeological record for the existence of the trade with the Indus civilization in Mesopotamia is meager. According to Andrew Robinson:

====Animal figurines====
Various figurines of exotic animals in gold or carnelian are thought to have been imported from Meluhha. Many such statuettes have been found in Mesopotamian excavations. The carnelian statuette of an Asian monkey was found in the excavation of the Acropolis of Susa, and dated to circa 2340–2100 BCE. It is thought that it may have been imported from India. It is now in the Louvre Museum, reference Sb5884.

===Maritime materials trade===
Specific items of high volume trade are timber and specialty wood such as ebony, for which large ships were used. Luxury items also appear, such as lapis lazuli mined at a Harappan colony at Shortugai (modern Badakhshan in northern Afghanistan). In the 1980s, important archaeological discoveries were made at Ras al-Jinz (Oman), located at the easternmost point of the Arabian Peninsula, demonstrating maritime Indus Valley connections with Oman, and the Middle East in general.

==Conflict with the Akkadians and Neo-Sumerians==

According to some accounts of the Akkadian king Rimush, he fought against the troops of Meluhha, in the area of Elam:

Gudea too, in one of his inscriptions, mentioned his victory over the territories of Magan, Meluhha, Elam and Amurru.

==Identification with the Indus Valley==
Most scholars suggest that &quot;Meluhha&quot; was the Sumerian name for the Indus Valley Civilisation. Finnish scholars Asko and Simo Parpola identify &quot;Meluhha&quot; (earlier variant &quot;Me-lah-ha&quot;) from earlier Sumerian documents with Dravidian &quot;mel akam&quot; &quot;high abode&quot; or &quot;high country&quot;. Many items of trade such as wood, minerals, and gemstones were indeed extracted from the hilly regions near the Indus settlements. They further claim that &quot;Meluhha&quot; is the origin of the Sanskrit word &quot;mleccha&quot;, meaning &quot;barbarian, foreigner&quot;.
Early texts, such as the Rimush inscription describing combat against Meluhha troops in the area of Elam circa 2200 BC, seem to indicate that Meluhha is to the east, suggesting either the Indus valley or India. However, much later texts, such as the &quot;Rassam cylinder&quot; documenting the military exploits of King Assurbanipal of Assyria (668–627 BC), long after the Indus Valley civilization had ceased to exist, seem to imply that &quot;Meluhha&quot; is to be found in Africa, in the area of Egypt.

There is sufficient archaeological evidence for the trade between Mesopotamia and the Indian subcontinent. Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of Harappa were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay seal impressions with cord or sack marks on the reverse side testify. A number of these Indian seals have been found at Ur and other Mesopotamian sites.

The Persian-Gulf style of circular stamped rather than rolled seals, also known from Dilmun, that appear at Lothal in Gujarat, India, and Failaka Island (Kuwait), as well as in Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade network, which G.L. Possehl has called a &quot;Middle Asian Interaction Sphere&quot;. What the commerce consisted of is less sure: timber and precious woods, ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, and luxury goods such as carnelian and glazed stone beads, pearls from the Persian Gulf, and shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for silver, tin, woolen textiles, perhaps oil and grains and other foods. Copper ingots, certainly, bitumen, which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia, may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and chickens, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia—all these have been instanced.

==&quot;Meluhha&quot; as Meroe, in the 14th–2nd centuries BCE==

&quot;Meluhha&quot; appears in EL-AMARNA letters, as a place at Kush/Nubia, near Egypt (EA70, EA95, EA108 ,EA112, EA117, EA132, EA133). 
In the Assyrian and Hellenistic eras, cuneiform texts continued to use (or revive) old place names, giving a perhaps artificial sense of continuity between contemporary events and events of the distant past. For example, Media is referred to as &quot;the land of the Gutians&quot;, a people who had been prominent around 2000 BC.

&quot;Meluhha&quot; also appears in these texts, in contexts suggesting that &quot;Meluhha&quot; and &quot;Magan&quot; were kingdoms adjacent to Egypt. In the Rassam cylinder, Ashurbanipal writes about his first march against Egypt: &quot;In my first campaign I marched against &quot;Magan&quot; and &quot;Meluhha&quot;, and Taharqa, king of &quot;Musur&quot; (Egypt) and &quot;Kûsu&quot; (&quot;Kingdom of Kush&quot;, ie Nubia), whom Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, the father who begot me, had defeated, and whose land he brought under his sway.&quot; In this context, &quot;Magan&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;Muṣur&quot; (ancient name of Egypt) and &quot;Meluhha&quot; as &quot;Meroe&quot; (capital of Nubia).

In the Hellenistic period, the term was used archaically to refer to Ptolemaic Egypt, as in an account of a festival celebrating the conclusion of the Sixth Syrian War, or in reference to the campaigns of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in Egypt (&quot;Antiochus the King marched triumphantly through the cities of Meluhha&quot;).

These references do not necessarily mean that early references to &quot;Meluhha&quot; also referred to Egypt. Direct contacts between Sumer and the Indus Valley had ceased even during the Mature Harappan phase when Oman and Bahrain (Magan and Dilmun) became intermediaries. After the sack of Ur by the Elamites and subsequent invasions in Sumer, its trade and contacts shifted west and Meluhha passed almost into mythological memory. The resurfacing of the name could simply reflect cultural memory of a rich and distant land, its use in records of Achaemenid and Seleucid military expeditions serving to aggrandize those kings. This kind of re-attribution of archaic geographical terms was a regular occurrence during the 1st millennium BCE.

<doc id="955788" wikidata="Q316952" url="?curid=955788" title="Hattori Hanzō">
<text>or &quot;Second Hanzō&quot;, nicknamed , was a famous samurai of the Sengoku era, who served the Tokugawa clan as a general, credited with saving the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu and then helping him to become the ruler of united Japan. He is often a subject of various portrayals in modern popular culture.

Hanzō was known as an expert tactician and a master of sword fighting, and was included in cultural sobriquet as one of Tokugawa&#x27;s 16 divine generals (&quot;Tokugawa jūrokushinshō&quot;).

He became known as the &quot;Second Hanzō&quot;. He would later earn the nickname because of the fearless tactics he displayed in his operations; this moniker also distinguished him from Watanabe Hanzō (Watanabe Moritsuna), who is nicknamed .

== Biography ==
Hattori Hanzō was born the son of , the &quot;First Hanzō&quot;, a minor samurai in the service of the Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) clan. His real name was . Despite being born in Mikawa Province (now Iga-chō, Okazaki, Aichi), he often paid visits to Iga Province, home of the Hattori clan. At the age of 15, his first battle was a nighttime attack during the siege of Uto castle in 1557.

In 1561, Hanzō served Tokugawa Ieyasu (who at the time was still called Matsudaira Motoyasu) and has great contribution with Ieyasu&#x27;s rise to power, helping the future shogun bring down the Imagawa clan. After Imagawa Ujizane had held Tokugawa&#x27;s wife and son as hostages, Hanzō made a successful hostage rescue of Tokugawa&#x27;s family at Kaminogo castle in 1562. 

In 1563, a major incident occurred which involved Hanzō. The Ikkō-ikki followers had rebelled in Mikawa and fought against Ieyasu. Moreover, the majority of the Tokugawa clan&#x27;s vassals were followers of the Ikko sect. Honda Masanobu and most of the vassals joined the Ikko Ikki and began to take hostile action against Ieyasu. During that time, Hanzō, who was also a follower of the Ikkō-ikki, instead kept his loyalty to the Tokugawa clan and supported Ieyasu to fight the rebels.

In 1569, Hanzō went on to lay siege to Kakegawa castle against the Imagawa clan.

From 1570 to 1573, Hanzō served with distinction at the battles of Anegawa and Mikatagahara respectively; it was during this conflict that Hanzō received the nickname &quot;Oni no Hanzō&quot;. According to the &quot;Kansei Chōshū Shokafu&quot;, Hattori Hanzō rendered meritorious service during the Battle of Mikatagahara and became commander of an Iga unit consisting of one hundred fifty men. He captured a Takeda spy named Chikuan, and when Takeda&#x27;s troops invaded Totomi, Hanzō counterattacked with only thirty warriors at the Tenryū River. He and Watanabe Moritsuna performed with exceptional skill with their spears. This prompting Moritsuna to gain a nickname of &quot;Yari no Hanzō&quot; (Spear Hanzo) while Hanzō being nicknamed as &quot;Oni no Hanzō&quot;, (Hanzō the demon).

In 1575, he married the daughter of fellow military commander Nagasaka Nobumasa. His son would be born around a year later.

In 1579, After Matsudaira Nobuyasu was accused of treason and conspiracy by Oda Nobunaga and was ordered to commit seppuku by his father, Ieyasu, Hanzō was called in to act as an official to assist the seppuku procession, but he refused to take the sword on the blood of his own lord. Ieyasu valued his loyalty after hearing of Hanzō&#x27;s ordeal and was noted to have said &quot;Even a demon can shed tears&quot;.

In 1580, another incident involving Hanzō and the Hattori clan occurred. During that time, a military commander of the Oda clan was staying in Hamamatsu Castle in preparation to assist the Oda-Tokugawa alliance to attack Takatenjin Castle, which belonged to the Takeda clan&#x27;s forces. However, a friction happened between the commander of the castle with a Tokugawa retainer over a trivial matter. Hanzō was trying to resolve the matter. However, the Ōgaki clan&#x27;s retainers who were on the side of the castle commander attacked Hanzo, which caused the members of Hattori clan to fight them back, resulting in casualties on both sides. As a result of this incident, the Ōgaki clan demanded Hanzō to be held responsible executed. Ieyasu, then manage to trick the Oda clan by pretending to arrest Hanzō at first. Then as Ieyasu allowed Hanzō to escape from his prison in Hamamatsu castle along with his wife and children. After that, Ieyasu deceived the Ōgaki clan by presenting them with a head of someone else, while claiming it was Hanzō&#x27;s head.

=== Journey through Iga province ===
In the middle of June 1582, after the Honnō-ji incident, Tokugawa Ieyasu escaped from Sakai to return into Mikawa, in order to prevent capture from Akechi Mitsuhide and his troops. Ieyasu had only 34 companions with him, including Hanzō. The journey in which they took was particularly dangerous due to the existence of &quot;Ochimusha-gari&quot;, or &quot;samurai hunting&quot; gangs. Ieyasu and his party, therefore, chose the shortest route back to the Mikawa Province by crossing through the Iga Province, which differed in many versions according to primary sources such as the records of &quot;Tokugawa Nikki&quot; or &quot;Mikawa Todai-Hon&quot;:

* The &quot;Tokugawa Nikki&quot; theory stated that Ieyasu took the roads to Shijonawate and Son&#x27;enji, then followed the Kizu stream until they spent a night in Yamaguchi castle. The next day, they reached a stronghold of the Kōka ikki clan of Tarao who allowed them to take refuge for the night. Then in the last day, Ieyasu&#x27;s group used a ship from Shiroko to reach Okazaki Castle. However, The &quot;Tokugawa Nikki&quot; theory is doubted by modern historians, since it was not actually the shortest route for Ieyasu to reach Mikawa from his starting position at Sakai, while on the other hand, it was also considered a very risky path due to the existence of Iga ikki clans which were hostile to the Oda and Tokugawa clans.
* The &quot;Mikawa Toda-Hon&quot; stated that Ieyasu went north from Ogawadate, crossed Koka, and entered Seishu Seki from Shigaraki, passed through Aburahi and entered Tsuge in Iga. This theory was championed by modern Japanese historians such as Tatsuo Fujita from Mie University, who had expressed doubts about the credibility of the story regarding Hattori Hanzō&#x27;s ninja helping Ieyasu, given that the story does not appear until the 18th century during the rule of Tokugawa Yoshimune. Some people claiming to be descendants of Kōka ikki clans also supported this route theory, and before they reached Kada pass where they could be escorted by the Kōka clan Jizamurai, Ieyasu mostly depended on his high-rank vassals for his protection, particularly the four Shitennō generals, rather than the popular theory about the help of &quot;Iga ninja&quot; clans.

Regardless of which theory is true, historians agreed that the trek ended at Kada (a mountain pass between Kameyama town and Iga). Tokugawa&#x27;s group suffered a last attack by the &quot;&#x27;ochimusha-gari&quot; outlaws at Kada pass where they reached the territory of the Kōka ikki clan of Jizamurai who were friendly to the Tokugawa clan. The Koka ikki samurai assisted Ieyasu to eliminate the threats of raiders and escorted them until they reached Iga Province, where they were further protected by other allied clans from Iga ikki which accompanied the Ieyasu group until they safely reached Mikawa. 

Portuguese missionary Luís Fróis had recorded in his work &quot;History of Japan&quot;, that during this journey, Tokugawa retainers such as Sakai Tadatsugu, Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and many others fought their way out against the raids and harassments of &quot;ochimusha-gari&quot; outlaws during their march escorting Ieyasu, while sometimes also paying bribes of gold and silver to those which they could negotiate with. Matsudaira Ietada recorded in his journal, &quot;Ietada nikki&quot; (家忠日記), that the escorts of Ieyasu had suffered around 200 casualties during their journey due to the raids from bandits and outlaws.

=== Further service under Tokugawa clan ===
According to Iga&#x27;s history book (伊賀者由緒書) compiled during the Edo period, the Iga clan ninja which Hanzō hailed from never missed a single battle which involved the Tokugawa clan, from the Battle of Izu Nirayama in 1582, to the Summer Siege of Osaka in 1615.

In late June 1582, a triangle conflict which was dubbed as the Tenshō-Jingo war broke out between the Tokugawa clan, Uesugi clan, and Hōjō clan. Hanzō participated in this conflict on the side of Tokugawa Ieyasu as he deployed his forces in various forts in the Kōfu basin against Ujinao, who camped his army in the area of present-day Hokuto city. Hanzō led the Iga clan warriors to Katsuyama castle (Kamisone-cho, Kofu city), Misakuchi castle, and Kotohirayama castle (Misakuchi-cho, Kofu city), where he monitored the Nakamichi road connecting Kai and Suruga. At the same time, a Tokugawa army detachment from the Iga Province commanded by Hanzō invaded Saku District, where they were also aided by Shinano local samurai warriors from the Tsugane clan led by Ōbi Sukemitsu. In early September, Hanzō and Sukemitsu launched a night attack on Egusuku castle (also known as Shishiku castle) and successfully captured it, under the cover of heavy rain. Later, he also took the Sanogoya castle in Izu Province under cover of heavy rain. Hanzō was praised by Ieyasu for this achievement.

In 1584, Hattori Hanzō continued to serve Ieyasu at the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute. During this battle, Hanzo marched to Ise commanding 100 warriors of Iga and Kōka ninja as reinforcements from Matsugashima Castle. His troops used rifles in defending the castle from the attacking Toyotomi forces.

In 1590, Hattori Hanzō participated in the Odawara campaign, where he led a troops of he led 50 members of Negoro-shū, a group of mercenaries using firearms that originated in Kii Province. After this conflict, Hanzō was awarded 8,000 &quot;koku&quot; of domain for his service. By the time Ieyasu relocated to Kantō region, Hanzō was given an additional 8,000 &quot;koku&quot; worth of domain, along with the command of 30 &quot;yoriki&quot; officers and 200 civil officials.

In 1597, Hanzō died on 2 January, succumbing to an unspecified illness.

== Legacy ==
Hanzō&#x27;s reputation as a samurai leader who commanded a 200-men strong unit of Iga warriors has grown to legendary proportions. Tales of Hattori&#x27;s exploits often attributed various supernatural abilities, such as teleportation, psychokinesis, and precognition.

After his death in 1597, Hattori Hanzō was succeeded by his son, whose name was also Masanari (third Hanzō), though written with different kanji (正就 instead of 正成). He was given the title &quot;Iwami no Kami&quot; (石見守) and his Iga men would act as guards of Edo Castle, the headquarters of the government of united Japan. &quot;Hanzō&quot; is actually a name passed down through the leaders of the Hattori family, meaning his father was also called Hanzō and so was his successor. Indeed, there were at least five people known as Hattori Hanzō throughout history.

To this day, artefacts of Hanzō&#x27;s legacy remain. Tokyo Imperial Palace (formerly the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s palace) still has a gate called Hanzō&#x27;s Gate (Hanzōmon), and the Hanzōmon subway line which runs from Hanzōmon Station in central Tokyo to the southwestern suburbs is named after the gate, where his house was once located. The neighbourhood outside Hanzō&#x27;s Gate is known as Wakaba, but before 1943 was named Iga-chō (&quot;Iga Town&quot;). Hanzō&#x27;s remains now rest in the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Yotsuya, Tokyo. The temple also holds his favourite spear and ceremonial battle helmet. The spear, originally 14 &quot;shaku&quot; (424 cm) long, 7.5 kg in weight, and given to him by Ieyasu, was donated to the temple by Hanzō as a votive offering, but was damaged during the bombing of Tokyo in 1945. Some of his other belongings are still in relatively good condition and can be viewed, but most other weapons, armour, and letters of commendation were lost due to a fire in Edo castle in 1606 that burned down his former quarters, the removal of his son from military command, and the chaos of the Siege of Osaka.

=== Modern and popular culture ===

As a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Hanzō was more popularly known in modern era as archetypical ninja figure and is featured in many fictional works. However, Hanzō was not featured in the first ninja boom of the Taishō era (1912-1926), as during that era, the ninja archetype figure in fictional works were more dominated by Sarutobi Sasuke and Kirigakure Saizō. Hanzō only started to gain his acknowledgement as legendary ninja in fictional works in the 1950s in various mediums such as novels, manga, anime, Japanese television drama, movies, and theatre of Japan. Important works in the process of creating &quot;Ninja Hattori Hanzo&quot; reputation include Shibata Renzaburo&#x27;s &quot;Akai Kageboshi&quot; (1960) and Yamada Futaro&#x27;s short story &quot;Ninja Hattori Hanzo&quot; (1964). The former portrays Hanzō as a central character who is deeply involved with the protagonist and runs through the story. The latter is a work that shows that &quot;Hattori Hanzo&quot; does not refer to a specific person, but is a name that is passed down.

<text>The Cherokee Strip of Kansas, in the United States, was a disputed strip of land on the southern border of the state.

==Description==
In 1825 the Osage Nation was given a reservation in eastern Indian territory in what is now Kansas. In the Treaty of New Echota, May 23, 1836, the northern border of the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s land was set as the southern border of the Osage lands. When Congress passed the Kansas–Nebraska Act on May 30, 1854, it set the southern border of the Kansas Territory as the 37th parallel north. It was thought at the time that the Osage northern border was also the 37th parallel.

The Cherokees immediately complained, saying that it was not the true boundary and that the border of Kansas should be moved north to accommodate the actual border of the Cherokee land.

The situation languished during the troubles in Kansas leading up to the Civil War. In the 1866 Cherokee Reconstruction treaty, the Cherokee agreed to cede, in trust to the United States, such portion of their land that is in present-day Kansas. A commission was set up to survey the disputed land. The survey, approved December 11, 1871, found that the border was &quot;off by 2.46 miles&quot; (3.96 km). The strip in question ran from the Neosho River to the 100th meridian and amounted to .

Under terms of Article 17 of the Treaty of 1866, the land was to be sold &quot;at not less than $1.25 an acre&quot; ($3.09/ha) for the first year and then offered for sale at local land offices. The first year were sold, and the balance of was turned over to land offices during the summer of 1879. As required, the proceeds were placed in the United States Treasury subject to order of the Cherokee national council.

<text>Macabeo, also called Viura or Macabeu (, ), is a white variety of wine grape.

It is widely grown in the Rioja region of northeastern Spain, the Cava producing areas south of Barcelona, and the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France. Spanish plantations stood at nearly in 2015, making it the second most grown white grape variety in Spain. In France, plantations accounted for in 2007.
Since 2009, some Macabeo is grown in Israel.

==Styles and winemaking==

The grape is mostly used to make mildly acidic and young white wines mostly suitable for early consumption or blending with other varieties, both red and white. 
Some of the most pleasurable examples of the variety are planted along the Pyrenees, where it is used to produce highly saline and textural white wine. 

It is often the main grape of white Rioja and is sometimes blended in small amounts with Tempranillo and red Garnacha, both in unoaked and oaked versions. It was introduced in Rioja after the phylloxera epidemic, where it largely replaced Malvasia and Garnacha blanca, partially because of the ability of its wines to better withstand oxidation. Some producers of white Rioja make superior wines (Reserva and Gran Reserva) subjected to extended ageing that can span decades, resulting in a highly distinctive and aromatic wine.

Macabeo (or Macabeu, as it is known in Catalan) is traditionally blended with Xarel·lo and Parellada to make cava, the best-known sparkling wine of Spain, and it is also used on its own in varietal wines. It is also used in the base spirit used to create Obsello Absinthe.

<text>Palomino Fino is a white grape widely grown in Spain and South Africa, and best known for its use in the manufacture of sherry. It is also grown in the Douro region of Portugal where it is used for table and fortified wines.

==Wine regions==

In Spain, the grape is split into the sub-varieties Palomino Fino, Palomino Basto, and Palomino de Jerez, of which Palomino Fino is by far the most important, being the principal grape used in the manufacture of sherry. The wine formed by fermentation of the grape is low in both acidity and sugar which, whilst suitable for sherry, ensures that any table wine made from it is of a consistently low quality, unless aided by acidification. It is the fourth most common white grape variety grown in Spain, with in 2015. There are substantial plantings in Andalusia for sherry production, and it is also widely grown on the Canary Islands, and in Galicia.

In France, it is referred to as Listán, and in South Africa as Fransdruif or White French. It is also found in Australia and California where it is also used mainly to produce fortified wines. The grape was once thought to be the Golden Chasselas, a grape grown in California. The wine-must has tendency to oxidise quickly, a characteristic that can be ignored when used for sherry production.

<text>Rondinella is an Italian wine grape variety. Almost all of the total global growing area of is in the Veneto region of northern Italy, and the grapes are used in wines from the Valpolicella and Bardolino wine regions. Rondinella always appears in these wines blended with Corvina (which DNA evidence has shown to be a parent variety), as a secondary constituent along with Corvinone and Molinara. The grape has rather neutral flavors but is favored by growers due to its prolific yields. The vine is very resistant to grape disease and produces grapes that, while they do not necessarily have high sugar levels, do dry out well for use in the production of Valpolicella straw wine styles such as Recioto and Amarone.

<doc id="955843" wikidata="Q1593374" url="?curid=955843" title="William McGonagle">
<text>William Loren McGonagle (November 19, 1925 – March 3, 1999) was a United States Navy officer who received the Medal of Honor for his actions while in command of the when it was attacked by Israel in the Eastern Mediterranean on June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War.

After accepting a commission in the United States Navy in 1944, McGonagle held various assignments before taking command of the &quot;Liberty&quot; in 1966. In June 1967 the &quot;Liberty&quot; was sailing in international waters in the Eastern Mediterranean when it was attacked by the Israel Defense Forces, injuring McGonagle, killing and injuring other members of his crew, and severely damaging the ship. He maintained control of the ship until help arrived, and after healing from his wounds was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on the &quot;Liberty&quot; in 1967. He continued his navy career, holding several more positions until retiring in 1974. When he died in 1999 he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors a short distance from the graves of some of his crew who were killed during the attack.

==Naval career==
McGonagle was born November 19, 1925, in Wichita, Kansas. After attending secondary school, McGonagle attended the University of Southern California in which he participated in the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Program. In June 1947, he accepted a commission in the navy as an ensign. He was assigned to the destroyer and after that was posted to the minesweeper from 1947–1950. During the Korean War he served on the minesweeper during the extensive operations that earned him and the other members of the crew a Presidential Unit Citation. From 1951 to 1966, he was assigned to various positions ashore and afloat, including commands of the fleet tug from 1957 to 1958 and the salvage ship from 1961 to 1963.

McGonagle took command of the in April 1966. On June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War between Israel and her Arab neighbors, the &quot;Liberty&quot; was attacked by Israeli forces while sailing in international waters in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Israeli government claims to this day that they thought that the ship was an Egyptian vessel. Israel relentlessly attacked the &quot;Liberty&quot; with jets, helicopters, and motor torpedo boats. McGonagle was severely wounded during the first air attack and although the bridge had sustained heavy damage he stayed and directed the defense of the ship, refusing to leave his post for medical attention. As the Israeli fighters continued their attack he maneuvered his ship, directed its defense, supervised the control of flooding and fire, and saw to the care of the casualties. Captain McGonagle remained at his battle station and continued to command his ship for more than 17 hours. It was only after rendezvous with a United States destroyer that he relinquished personal control of the &quot;Liberty&quot; and permitted himself to be removed from the bridge. The combined air and sea attack killed 34 crew members including naval officers, seamen, two Marines, and a civilian, wounded 171, and severely damaged the ship. Although the ship had a 39 ft (12 m) wide by 24 ft (7.3 m) high hole and a twisted keel from a torpedo impact, the crew kept the ship afloat, and were able to leave the area under their own power. When the damage to the ship was assessed 821 rocket, shell, and machine-gun holes were found in the ship&#x27;s hull.
The Medal of Honor was presented to him, in secret, at the Washington Navy Yard by the Secretary of the Navy, rather than at the White House by the President. This represents the only time a Medal of Honor recipient was awarded in such a manner. After being promoted to captain in October 1967 and recovering from his wounds he was given command of the new ammunition ship . He then served as commanding officer of the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Unit at the University of Oklahoma before retiring from active duty in 1974.

==Death and legacy==

For several decades following the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident, he refused to publicly comment on the attack. He made occasional appearances with his surviving crew, such as on the 24th anniversary of the attack (in 1991) in a reunion at the White House. During his later years, including during the White House reunion, he suffered from cancer. On the 30th anniversary of the attack (in 1997), during a reunion held at Arlington National Cemetery, he finally called for an investigation and denounced Israel’s mistaken identity claim: “I think it’s about time that the state of Israel and the United States government provide the crew members of the Liberty and the rest of the American people the facts of what happened, and why…the &quot;Liberty&quot; was attacked 30 years ago today. For many years I have wanted to believe that the attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot; was pure error. It appears to me that it was not a pure case of mistaken identity. It was, on the other hand, gross incompetence and aggravated dereliction of duty on the part of many officers and men of the state of Israel.”

On March 3, 1999, he died in Palm Springs, California, and, following services at the Post Chapel at Fort Myer, Virginia, he was buried with full military honors on April 9, 1999, at Arlington National Cemetery with members of his USS &quot;Liberty&quot; crew in attendance. His grave can be found in section 34, lot 208 map grid U/V 11 near the common gravesite of six other members of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; crew.

==Awards and honors==


===Medal of Honor citation===

The President of the United States of America, authorized by an Act of Congress, June 11, 1968, has awarded, in the name of Congress, the Medal of Honor to


Captain McGonagle’s Medal of Honor citation does not list the nationality of the military forces which attacked his ship. This omission is highly unusual and was allegedly due to a supposed cover-up by the incumbent presidential administration, although this remains highly contentious.

===Other honors===
A Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to McGonagle for Veterans Day in 1999, recognizing him as one of five Medal of Honor recipients from the Southern California desert area.

The Captain William L. McGonagle Branch Medical/Dental Clinic was dedicated at Naval Security Group Activity Northwest, Chesapeake VA, on December 5, 1997. This is believed to be one of the few times in history a U.S. Naval building has been dedicated in honor of a living sailor.

<text>2C-N (2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrophenethylamine) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin.

==Chemistry==
The full name of the chemical is 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrophenyl)ethanamine.

Salts of 2C-N have a bright yellow to orange color due to the presence of the nitro group, unlike all other members of the 2C family in which the salts are white.

==Synthesis==
2C-N is synthesized by the mixed acid nitration of 2C-H using sulfuric acid and nitric acid.

==Dosage==
In his book &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, Shulgin lists the dosage range as 100-150 mg. 2C-N is generally taken orally, and effects typically last 4 to 6 hours.

==Effects==
Shulgin accounts his experiences after ingesting 2C-N:
(with 120 mg) This came on very fast--I was aware of it within a half hour, and it got as far as it would go by an hour. There are similarities to MDMA, but missing is the benign anti-stress component. I am light-headed, and there just might be a little eye wiggling. And then it dropped right off to nothing within a couple of hours.

(with 150 mg) There may have been some visual changes, I&#x27;m not sure. But the talking was extremely easy. If there were no other things to use, this would be excellent, but there are other compounds available. This doesn&#x27;t have too high a priority.

(with 150 mg) Am I enjoying it? Not exactly, but I am in a good mood. There is not the light-filled energy that some other materials can provide. By six hours, pretty much baseline. Strange material, but okay. Final score: body +3, mind +2, barely.

==Legal status==

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016, 2C-N is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

===United States===
In the United States, 2C-N is a Schedule 1 controlled substance.

===United Kingdom===
2C-N and most (possibly all) other compounds featured in PiHKAL are illegal drugs in the United Kingdom.

<text>John Greg Ganske (born March 31, 1949) is an American politician, plastic surgeon, and retired U.S. Army reserve lieutenant colonel from Iowa. He served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for U.S. Senator from Iowa in 2002.

==Early life and education==
Ganske was born in New Hampton, Iowa to parents Victor and Mary Jo Ganske. He earned honors in wrestling in high school, and was an American Field Service exchange student to Costa Rica in 1966.

He graduated from the University of Iowa with a B.A.with honors in political science and general science in 1972. In 1976, Ganske graduated from the University of Iowa School of Medicine, and subsequently completed a general surgery residency in 1982 at the Oregon Health Sciences Center and a plastic and reconstructive surgery residency at Harvard in 1984, training under Nobel Laureate Dr. Joe Murray.

== Career ==
Ganske worked as a plastic surgeon in Des Moines until he challenged veteran Democratic Congressman Neal Smith in 1994. Ganske campaigned in a cream 1958 DeSoto (Smith having won his first congressional race in that year), playing songs from that era. Ganske was also helped by the 1990s round of redistricting. Smith had previously represented a district that was more or less coextensive with the Des Moines metropolitan area, but redistricting had pushed it into southwestern Iowa, an area Smith did not know and that did not know him. In one of the biggest upsets in recent congressional history, Ganske defeated Smith by six points, largely by running up large margins in southwestern Iowa.

Ganske was nearly defeated for reelection in 1996, but was reelected with little difficulty in 1998 and 2000. He was considered a relatively moderate Republican, which played well in a district dominated by traditionally-Democratic Des Moines.

After the 2000 round of redistricting, much of the 4th district was shifted into the 5th district, which created a district that covered all of western Iowa. However, Ganske&#x27;s home city of Des Moines was drawn into the 3rd district, represented by Democrat Leonard Boswell. Rather than running for reelection, Ganske ran for the United States Senate against incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin. He easily won the Republican nomination, but lost to Harkin by 10 points. Following that election, he resumed his practice in Des Moines.

== Personal life ==
During medical school, Ganske met and married his wife, Corrine Mikkelson.

<text>The Archbishop of Canterbury is the &quot;Primate of All England&quot;, effectively serving as the head of the established Church of England and, symbolically, of the worldwide Anglican Communion. Before the Reformation, the archbishop served as a prelate of the Catholic Church.

== History ==
From the 6th century to the 16th century, the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the Bishops of Rome, the Popes. Eighteen such pre-Reformation archbishops have been canonised by the Catholic Church. During the English Reformation, the English Church broke away from the authority of the pope, at first temporarily, later permanently, recognising only the English monarch as a source of superior temporal authority.

In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the nomination procedure of the archbishop and other bishops. At various times the nomination was made by the Canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the English monarch, or the Pope. Since the Reformation, the church is explicitly a state church and nomination is legally that of the British crown; today it is made in the name of the monarch by the prime minister of the United Kingdom, from a shortlist of two selected by the Crown Nominations Commission, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee.

Today the archbishop has four main roles:
*They are the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury, which covers the east of the County of Kent and the extreme north-east of Surrey. Founded by Augustine of Canterbury in 597, it is the oldest bishopric in the English church. The main duties of this role are delegated to the suffragan Bishop of Dover (who in this capacity is called the &quot;Bishop in Canterbury&quot;).
*They are the metropolitan bishop of the Province of Canterbury, encompassing 30 dioceses in the southern two-thirds of England. The remaining 14 dioceses in the north of England fall within the Province of York, under the authority of the archbishop of York. Four dioceses in Wales were under the Province of Canterbury until they were transferred to the dis-established Church in Wales in 1920.
*As &quot;Primate of All England&quot;, they are the chief &quot;religious&quot; figure in the Church of England (senior to the archbishop of York, who is styled the &quot;Primate of England&quot;). The British sovereign is the supreme governor of the Church of England.
*As symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, the archbishop is recognised as &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;) of all Anglican primates.

==Heraldry==
Much heraldry relating to archbishops of Canterbury is displayed in the church of St Mary-at-Lambeth in London, near to Lambeth Palace the London seat of the archbishops.

==List of archbishops==
===Old English period===
===After the Norman conquest===
===After the Elizabethan Settlement===
==Assistant bishops==
Those who have assisted the diocesan archbishop have included:

Two coadjutors – called Bishop of St Martin&#x27;s — to Saxon archbishops:
*1035–1038: Eadsige, who succeeded as Archbishop
* (d.): Godwin
Lanfranc declared that appointments to that See would cease, and the Bishop of Rochester would deputise instead.

*1044–1048 (res.): Siward, coadjutor-archbishop/suffragan bishop, probably titular Bishop of Uppsala
*15 July 1469?: Henry, consecrated to the titular see of Ioppe
*1469: Thomas Scrope, absentee Bishop of Dromore and assistant Bishop of Norwich (1450–1477)
*1480: William Westkarre, Prior of Mottisfont, titular bishop of Zeitun and assistant Bishop of Winchester (1457–1486)
*1526–?: Thomas Chetham was consecrated titular bishop of Sidon on 19 January 1526 to serve as an assistant to the Archbishop of Canterbury and became an assistant to the Bishop of London in 1553

Modern assistant bishops have included:
*1928–1939 (d.): Arthur Knight, Rector of Lyminge and former Bishop of Rangoon
*1935–1941 (ret.): Edward Bidwell, Vicar of Sellindge and former Bishop of Ontario
*1942–1955 (ret.): Basil Roberts, Warden of St Augustine&#x27;s College and former Bishop of Singapore
*1960–1961 (res.): Denis Hall, Vicar of Thornton Heath and former Assistant Bishop on the Niger
*1994–1997 (res.): David Evans, Gen. Sec. of SAMS and former Bishop in Peru

==Notes==
* All start dates are consecration dates, unless otherwise noted.
* All end dates are death dates, unless otherwise noted.
* He was not consecrated until 15 January 1245.

<text>Rotberger is a wine grape variety. Its parentage is not known with certainty but it is thought to be from a cross of Trollinger and Riesling grapes. Dr. Heinrich Birk (1898-1973) produced the cross at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1928. It is used to produce fruity, early maturing light red wines in cool-climate areas. It is often best drunk when young and can be used to produce a rosé or sparkling wine. It has no relationship with the Rotburger variety bearing a nearly similar name which is also known as Zweigelt.

Production of rotberger is quite small and primarily limited to Austria, Canada, Germany, and Liechtenstein.

Local programming was produced and broadcast from Radio Forth&#x27;s Edinburgh studios on weekdays from 6-10a.m., presented by Gregor Runciman and Lynsey Gibson.

===News and sport===
Radio Borders broadcast local news bulletins hourly from 6a.m. to 7p.m. on weekdays and from 7a.m. to 1p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines were broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, including sports reports. Traffic bulletins were presenter-led and broadcast at 20 and 40 minutes past the hour between 6 and 9a.m. as well as between 4 and 7p.m.

Local news bulletins were produced in conjunction with Radio Forth&#x27;s newsroom in Edinburgh and Metro Radio&#x27;s newsroom in Newcastle.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio were carried overnight with bespoke networked Scottish bulletins at weekends, produced from Radio Clyde&#x27;s newsroom in Clydebank.

<text>The jaculus (or iaculus, pl. &quot;jaculi&quot;, meaning &quot;thrown&quot; in Latin) is a small mythical serpent or dragon. It can be shown with wings and sometimes has front legs. It is also sometimes known as the javelin snake.

==In Greek mythology==
It was said that the jaculus hid in the trees and sprang out at its victims. The force of it launching itself at the victim led to the association with javelins. Pliny described it as follows: &quot;The jaculus darts from the branches of trees; and it is not only to our feet that the serpent is formidable, for these fly through the air even, just as though they were hurled from an engine.&quot;

Lucan also describes the attack of the jaculus in the &quot;Pharsalia&quot;. He explains that it is the wound caused by the jaculus hitting the victim that causes death. The jaculus does not kill with venom.

This is similar to Malagasy folklore concerning the fandrefiala, identified with &quot;Ithycyphus miniatus&quot;, a small snake with v-shaped markings on its head resembling a speartip. After carefully plotting its trajectory with the aid of thrown leaves, the fandrefiala is said to hurl itself at potential victims with enough force to break a metal pot; the impact of this collision inevitably proves fatal to both snake and target.

A &quot;jaculus&quot; is also found in the Old Norse romance &quot;Yngvars saga viðfǫrla&quot;. Here it is actually said to be an extremely large dragon (&quot;dreki&quot;). See Olson, Emil, ed. &quot;Yngvars saga viðfǫrla&quot; &quot;Jämte ett bihang om Ingvarsinskrifterna&quot;. Copenhagen: S. L. Møllers, 1912, p. 42.

The &quot;iaculus&quot; is described as a &#x27;javelin-snake,&#x27; or a snake that flies from trees, in the medieval Aberdeen Bestiary.

==In the Renaissance==

Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s notebooks mention an Iaculus who leaps from trees and impales its victims.

==In popular culture==

*One of the units available in the 1999 turn-based strategy game &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III&quot; from Fortress towns is the Jaculus-like Serpent Fly and its upgraded Dragon Fly form.
*Jaculi are briefly mentioned in &quot;&quot;, as &quot;Serpens volucer&quot;. Signs of the Jaculus are impaled prey, and pools of pink dung.
*In &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, the monster &quot;Mecha Phantom Beast Jaculuslan&quot; is partly based on a Jaculus.

<text>Gallaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis.

== Description ==
The Romans named the northwest part of Hispania or the Iberian Peninsula &quot;Gallaecia&quot; after the Celtic tribes of the area the Gallaeci or Gallaecians.

The Gallaic make their entry into written history in the first-century epic &quot;Punica&quot; of Silius Italicus on the First Punic War:




 (Book III pp. 344–347)

&quot;Rich Gallaecia sent its youths, wise in the knowledge of divination by the entrails of beasts, by feathers and flames—who, now crying out the barbarian song of their native tongue, now alternately stamping the ground in their rhythmic dances until the ground rang, and accompanying the playing with sonorous &quot; (a was a small type of shield used in the region).
Gallaecia, as a region, was thus marked for the Romans as much for the Gallaeci&#x27;s &quot;castros&quot;, a system of hillforts, as it was for the lure of its gold mines. This culture extended over present day Galicia, the north of Portugal, the western part of Asturias, the Bierzo, and Sanabria and was distinct from the neighbouring Lusitanian culture to the south according to the classical authors Pomponius Mela and Pliny the Elder.

At a far later date, the mythic history that was encapsulated in &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; credited Gallaecia as the point from which the Gaels sailed to conquer Ireland, as they had Gallaecia, by force of arms.

== History ==
=== Pre-Roman Gallaecia ===
Strabo in his &quot;Geography&quot; lists the people of the northwestern Atlantic coast of Iberia as follows:
... then the Vettonians and the Vaccaeans, through whose territory the Durius [Douro] River flows, which affords a crossing at Acutia, a city of the Vaccaeans; and last, the Callaicans, [Gallaicans] who occupy a very considerable part of the mountainous country. For this reason, since they were very hard to fight with, the Callaicans themselves have not only furnished the surname for the man who defeated the Lusitanians [meaning Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus, Roman general] but they have also brought it about that now, already, most of the Lusitanians are called Callaicans.
=== Roman Gallaecia ===
After the Punic Wars, the Romans turned their attention to conquering Hispania. The tribe of the &quot;Gallaeci&quot; 60,000 strong, according to Paulus Orosius, faced the Roman forces in 137 BC in a battle at the river Douro (, , , ), which resulted in a great Roman victory, by virtue of which the Roman proconsul Decimus Junius Brutus returned a hero, receiving the agnomen &quot;Callaicus&quot; (&#x27;conqueror of the Callaicoi&#x27;, a Gallaecian tribe inhabiting the southernmost region of Gallaecia by the mouth of the Douro), his campaign followed the Atlantic coast all the way to the river Limia, but no further than the river Miño. This campaign was largely a punitive one, in the context of the aftermath of the Lusitanian wars, as the capital of the Callaici (Portus Cale) was only definitively occupied by Marcus Perpena in 74 BC. 

Further incursions in southern Gallaecia, included Publius Licinius Crassus&#x27;s campaign of 96–94 BC.

The first incursion into Northern Gallaecia happened in 61 BC, during Julius Caesar&#x27;s consulship, a largely naval-based campaign across the entire Northern Hispanic coastline, defeating the Gallaecians a battle near Brigantium.

The final conquest of Gallaecia happened during the Cantabrian Wars, fought under the Emperor Augustus from 26 to 19 BC. The resistance was appalling: collective suicide rather than surrender, mothers who killed their children before committing suicide, crucified prisoners of war who sang triumphant hymns, rebellions of captives who killed their guards and returned home from Gaul.

For Rome, Gallaecia was a region formed exclusively by two —the and the —and was distinguished clearly from other zones like the Asturica, according to written sources:

*Legatus iuridici to per ASTURIAE ET GALLAECIAE.
*Procurator ASTURIAE ET GALLAECIAE.
*Cohors ASTURUM ET GALLAECORUM.
*Pliny: ASTURIA ET GALLAECIA

In the 3rd century AD, Diocletian created an administrative division which included the of Gallaecia, Asturica, and possibly Cluniense. This province took the name of Gallaecia since it was the most populous and important zone within the province. In 409, as Roman control collapsed, the Suebi conquests transformed Roman Gallaecia (convents Lucense and Bracarense) into the Kingdom of Galicia (the recorded by Hydatius and Gregory of Tours).

=== Later Gallaecia ===

On the night of 31 December 406 AD, several Germanic barbarian tribes, the Vandals, Alans, and Suebi, swept over the Roman frontier on the Rhine. They advanced south, pillaging Gaul, and crossed the Pyrenees. They set about dividing up the Roman provinces of Carthaginiensis, Tarraconensis, Gallaecia, and Baetica. The Suebi took part of Gallaecia, where they later established a kingdom. After the Vandals and Alans left for North Africa, the Suebi took control of much of the Iberian Peninsula. However, Visigothic campaigns took much of this territory back. The Visigoths emerged victorious in the wars that followed, and eventually annexed Gallaecia.

After the Visigothic defeat and the annexation of much of Hispania by the Moors, a group of Visigothic states survived in the northern mountains, including Gallaecia. In Beatus of Liébana (d. 798), &quot;Gallaecia&quot; became used to refer to the Christian part of the Iberian peninsula, whereas &quot;Hispania&quot; was used for the Muslim one. The emirs, preferring to focus on the task of consolidation of conquered territory, ultimately never expanded into these highly defended mountains, which the Romans before them also had taken generations to incorporate.

In Charlemagne&#x27;s time, bishops of Gallaecia attended the Council of Frankfurt in 794. During his residence in Aachen, he received embassies from Alfonso II of Gallaecia, according to the Frankish chronicles.

Sancho III of Navarre in 1029 refers to Bermudo III of León as .

<doc id="955934" wikidata="Q5010727" url="?curid=955934" title="Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland">
<text>Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland formerly CFM is an Independent Local Radio station based in Carlisle, England, owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Cumbria and South West Scotland. 

On 3 April 2023, almost 30 years to the day after launching as the station rebranded to Greatest Hits Radio with the previous breakfast show host Robbie Dee began presenting the 1pm - 4pm afternoon show, until the closure of the Carlisle studios on Friday 27 September 2024.

As of March 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 75,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==
The station was launched by its original owners, Border Television at 8am on 14 April 1993 when managing director and breakfast show host John Myers played &quot;The Best&quot; by Tina Turner as its first song.

Originally CFM only broadcast from their Caldbeck mast to Carlisle on and Penrith, from the top of Beacon Hill, on . In September 1995, they also started transmitting to West Cumbria from their transmitters at Broughton Moor () and Whitehaven ().

From its launch, the station broadcast from premises adjacent to the ITV Border studios in Durranhill, Carlisle. In April 2010, CFM moved to a new base at Atlantic House in Kingstown, Carlisle.

In 2005, Emap bought CFM and branded it as one of its Big City Network of stations. Three years later, Emap was bought by Bauer.

Previously, CFM has won numerous industry awards including the Radio Academy&#x27;s North West Station of the Year 2005 and Emap Station of the Year 2006. In May 2013, CFM became the first radio station to broadcast from a nuclear reprocessing site at Sellafield, West Cumbria.

CFM was one of two stations within the Hits Radio Network that did not broadcast on DAB (the other being Radio Borders based in Galashiels). This was due to the lack of local DAB multiplexes in Cumbria. However, in May 2019, Ofcom announced plans to advertise three local multiplexes in Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland. Bauer made the sole application to Ofcom to run the North &amp; West Cumbria DAB Multiplex, stating that they planned to place CFM as well as other Bauer owned stations on it, alongside BBC Radio Cumbria. In December 2019, Ofcom confirmed that the multiplex licence would be awarded to Bauer Digital Radio, with the multiplex originally expected to begin transmission in late 2020. However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this had been pushed back to 1 December 2021.

On 1 December 2021, the DAB Multiplex for North and West Cumbria was switched on (the subsequent multiplex for South Cumbria and North Lancashire owned by MuxCo was also switched on but does not carry the same stations as the Bauer owned one), and CFM along with a number of other Bauer owned radio stations as well as BBC Radio Cumbria began broadcasting for the first time on DAB in the area.

On 26th September 2024 it was announced that the Carlisle studios will be closing on Friday 27th September and the local afternoon show will end. Instead the station will take the National afternoon show as the Breakfast Show broadcast from Liverpool counts as a local show, this ends all locally broadcast programming on this station.

== Network programming approval == 

In March 2021, it was announced that Bauer had received approval for full networking in North West England. It was hinted that CFM may move from its Carlisle studios to Bauer&#x27;s Radio City Liverpool studios in the Radio City Tower, or the network&#x27;s Manchester headquarters. It was also expressed that Bauer may reduce CFM&#x27;s local programming to the minimum legal requirement of 3 hours per day.

On 21 April 2022, Bauer announced that local programming outside weekday breakfast would be replaced with further networked output from Hits Radio. Local news bulletins and traffic updates were not affected.

On 26 September 2024, Bauer announced that its remaining local programme presented by Robbie Dee would be ending on 27 September due to the closure of the station’s Carlisle studios on the same day. The last remaining local programme ended at 4:00pm on the same day. The move marked the official end of all local programming for the station as all programming for the station comes from the Greatest Hits Radio network.

==Programming==

Networked programming originates from Bauer&#x27;s studios in Manchester, Liverpool, London, Birmingham and Glasgow. 

Local programming was produced and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Carlisle studios on weekdays from 1-4pm until the closure of the Carlisle studios on 27 September 2024. 

===News===
Bauer&#x27;s Manchester newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am-7pm on weekdays and from 7am-1pm on weekends. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked bulletins on weekend afternoons, usually originating from Bauer&#x27;s Manchester newsroom.

<doc id="955945" wikidata="Q3354729" url="?curid=955945" title="Operation Igloo White">
<text>Operation Igloo White was a covert United States joint military electronic warfare operation conducted from late January 1968 until February 1973, during the Vietnam War. These missions were carried out by the 553rd Reconnaissance Wing, a U.S. Air Force unit flying modified EC-121R Warning Star aircraft, and VO-67, a specialized U.S. Navy unit flying highly modified OP-2E Neptune aircraft. This state-of-the-art operation utilized electronic sensors, computers, and communications relay aircraft in an attempt to automate intelligence collection. The system would then assist in the direction of strike aircraft to their targets. The objective of those attacks was the logistical system of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) that snaked through southeastern Laos and was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese).

==Establishment of Igloo White==
The idea of a system to interdict North Vietnamese infiltration into South Vietnam had been proposed in the years before 1965 and finally led to the construction of a defensive barrier system including electronic sensors, which is best known as the McNamara Line, on January 13, 1967, when President Johnson authorized the construction. The defensive barrier system project had many cover name changes, such as Practice Nine until 14 June 1967, Illinois City (June 1967), Dye Marker (September 1967), Muscle Shoals (September 13, 1967) and finally Igloo White (June 1968). When the air-supported subsystem in eastern and central Laoshe was added in 1967, the project was named Muscle Shoals. In June 1968, when the program was renamed Igloo White, it consisted of three components: 
* Munitions and sensing devices which were placed across and along suspected routes of infiltration to detect and impede enemy foot or vehicular movement;
* Orbiting aircraft which received signals from these sensors, amplified them, and retransmitted them; 
* An Infiltration Surveillance Center (ISC) which received the transmitted signals from the aircraft and analyzed them to produce reliable tactical information for planning and interdiction operations.

The Igloo White system was originally expected to impede enemy infiltration through the use of minefields and aid in determining when mine reseeding was necessary. Sensors were also to be used along trails and roads to provide real-time target information for 3 tactical airstrikes. By July 1968, the munitions had proved to be relatively ineffective, and the use of sensors to obtain reconnaissance information was rapidly becoming the principal objective of the Igloo White system.

==Effective implementation==

&quot;Igloo White&quot; was rushed into service during the Battle of Khe Sanh and successfully passed its first operational test. Combined with Operation Commando Hunt in 1969, the system served as the keystone of the U.S. aerial interdiction effort of the Vietnam War.

In spite of costing between $1 and $1.7 billion to design and build, and an additional billion dollars per year to operate over the five-year life of the operation and, while containing some of the most sophisticated technology in the Southeast Asia theater, the effectiveness of &quot;Igloo White&quot; still remains in question.

==Development==
As early as June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s special military representative, had become interested in the prospect of erecting a physical barrier to halt the increasing infiltration of PAVN materiel (and later, manpower) through their Laotian logistical corridor and into the border regions of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He then held talks with the deputy director of the Pentagon&#x27;s Office of Special Operations, Edward G. Lansdale, who convinced him that a better solution to the infiltration dilemma would be the creation of mobile units to attack the infiltrators.

After the initiation of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When that failed as a strategy, the aerial effort was redirected to serve as an anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B. Johnson on 11 November 1968.

As early as 1966 Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara had become disenchanted with &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;. In January McNamara was presented with a working paper by the American academic Roger Fisher, who proposed a less costly physical and electronic barrier that would be located in South Vietnam. It was to consist of a long, wide barrier that would stretch from the South China Sea south of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), across the Laotian frontier and on to the border of Thailand. The physical barrier itself would be supported by electronic sensors and extensive minefields. Fisher estimated that it would take approximately five U.S. divisions to erect and defend the system.

The Joint Chiefs and CINCPAC turned down the concept, believing that it would consume the efforts of too many troops and create a logistical nightmare. McNamara, however, was intrigued. Ignoring the military chiefs, he approached the Institute for Defense Analyses and requested that it fund a study of the concept. The project was then handed over to the Jason Division (also referred to as the Jason Group or Jason Committee), a group of 67 scientists who were to study and develop the technology necessary to make the physical/electronic barrier feasible. The group concentrated its efforts in three key areas: communications; data processing and display; and sensor development. On 15 September 1966, McNamara made Army General Alfred D. Starbird the head of the newly formed Defense Communications Planning Group (DCPG), which was to oversee the implementation of the program. The barrier concept was then given the designation &quot;Practice Nine&quot;. The DCPG&#x27;s original mission profile, as of September 1966, was simply to implement the anti-infiltration system devised by the Jason Division. The original plan foresaw the deployment of both a physical barrier in addition to an air-supported barrier using various electronic sensors.

In June 1967 the barrier project, by then referred to as the Strong Point Obstacle System (or SPOS) was renamed &quot;Illinois City&quot;, which lasted for a month before the program was redesignated &quot;Dyemarker&quot;. On 6 July, groundbreaking ceremonies were conducted for the command center of the operation. Construction work was completed three months later. The new Infiltration Surveillance Center (ISC) was located at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, nine miles (14 km) west of Nakhon Phanom city on the banks of the Mekong River. The first commander of the unit was Air Force Brigadier General William P. McBride, whose superior was the deputy commander of the Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force at Udon Thani, Thailand. From its creation the ISC (and the operations conducted from it) was known as Task Force Alpha.

On 8 September 1967, the electronic portion of &quot;Dyemarker&quot; was divided and the aerial, sensor-based portion was designated &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot;. On 1 June 1968, the aerial portion was redesignated &quot;Igloo White&quot;. That name became the most associated with the program though various elements received a number of separate codenames. All resources for &quot;Dyemarker/Muscle Shoals&quot; were redesignated &quot;Duck Blind&quot; in April 1968, and in June 1968 &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot; outright became &quot;Duel Blade&quot;. In October 1968 &quot;Duck Blind&quot; was changed to &quot;Duffel Bag&quot;.

In mid-1968, the physical barrier concept was pushed aside after the North Vietnamese overran the Lang Vei Special Forces camp and besieged Khe Sanh. The barrier concept was reduced to an aerial, sensor-based electronic interdiction program that was to be conducted in Laos.

== Sensors and Weapons ==

The Defense Communications Planning Group&#x27;s research and development program created an advanced technological system. &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot; would consist of three interdependent parts. First, there were air-dropped, battery-powered acoustic and seismic sensors. The camouflaged sensors were to be dropped in strings at predetermined geographical points along the PAVN logistical network. Once emplaced, they would serve as tripwires to any movement or activity along the system.

The first sensors utilized by the program were Air-Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detector (ADSID), which had been developed from devices then in use in underground mapping for the oil industry. The device could sense vertical earth motion by the use of an internal geophone and could determine whether a man or a vehicle was in motion at a range of and respectively. The first acoustic sensors were developed from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Project &quot;Jezebel&quot; anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys, which recorded and processed sound by the utilization of an audio spectrum analyzer. The first model of seismic detectors (Phase I) outshone their contemporary acoustic types in the quality and quantity of the information they reported. The Phase I models of both the acoustic and seismic sensors were only available for operation in a continuous mode, which meant that under normal conditions, their lithium batteries would function for approximately 30 days.
The Acoustic Seismic Intrusion Detector (ACOUSID), combined the operations of both seismic and acoustic devices, with the added ability to transmit sound from a built-in microphone. The ACOUSID had three switchable detection modes: in the C mode, a line spectrum detector determined the presence of enemy vehicles and had an effective range of ; an I Mode which was activated by sounds picked up by its internal microphone and could detect personnel at a range of ; and a B Mode that combined both of the above abilities and operated in a continuous real-time mode of 40 activations per hour with a battery life of 30 days.

The sensors reported their data via radio frequency channels ranging upward from 162 megahertz (MHz) to 174 MHz on the very high frequency band. 31 channels were assigned to each type of sensor with a 375 kHz separation between each channel. Every channel contained 27 identification codes or addresses which could be set in the field prior to emplacement. Thus, a total of 837 individual sensors (27x31) could be deployed at any one time without signal duplication in a single operational zone. 
The deployment of gravel mines and the Wide-Area Anti-Personnel Mine System became integral parts of the operation. Other weapons were specifically developed or otherwise became associated with the campaign as well. These notably included the BLU-31/B and Mk 36 air-dropped mines, BLU-43/B and BLU-44/B landmine system (&quot;Dragontooth&quot;), the BLU-72/B fuel-air explosive (&quot;Pave Pat&quot;), and the BLU-52/A chemical bomb (filled with bulk CS-2 powder). Anti-vehicle operations in support of &quot;Muscle Shoals/Igloo White&quot; were designated &quot;Mud River&quot;, while anti-personnel operations received the codename &quot;Dump Truck&quot;.

PAVN personnel moving on foot through the trail system would be detected by the detonation of air-sown, aspirin-sized, wide-area gravel mines, which would activate the sensors. Subsequent bomb damage assessment missions and hand emplacement of sensors and mines in support of &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot; would be carried out by the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG). A number of hand emplaced units were developed for this role, including the MICROSID and MINISID, and a device designed to work with either called MAGID, a magnetic detector, designed to be triggered by amounts of metal as small as an infantry rifle.
The sensors were designed for air deployment by either of two means. The first was by parachute, which would hang the devices in trees, where they appeared to be part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which would drive the spike-shaped device into the ground like a lawn dart, burying all but their antennae, which were designed to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.

The second phase of sensor development improved the older models by providing for non-continuous operation as directed by the ISC. They also had the capability of carrying out three separate reporting functions: to report current information (transmitting noises or earth tremors); to keep silent, but to count impulses and respond when queried; or to remain in constant operation like the Phase I models. Their batteries also provided the ability to operate for approximately 15 days longer than the Phase I models (45 days).

During late 1969, Phase IV sensors began to be deployed in-theater. These had a greater number of available communications channels, which allowed the seeding of a larger sensor field without fear of signal interference. By 1971–1972 a new sensor with a commandable microphone (COMMMIKE III) and another with a vehicle ignition detector (EDET III, which could detect the unshielded ignition systems of gasoline engines) were introduced. In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, and the engine detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.

==Analysis of sensor results==

The sensor transmitters would relay their data to the second element of the system, an orbiting EC-121R aircraft of the Air Force&#x27;s 553rd Reconnaissance Wing, based at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base. The EC-121s would then relay the collected information via a radio link at 2200 to 2300 MHz to Nakhon Phanom. At Task Force Alpha, the last of the three components in the system, the intelligence data (from a variety of sources, not just the sensors) would be entered, collated, retrieved, and stored by two IBM 360/40 (later two 360/65) computers. Technicians at the center controlled the system from a variety of video displays that were also linked to the computers.

Analysts at the center concentrated on such arcane topics as pathway predictions, delay intervals, route segments, and choke points. The computers analyzed sensor data and compiled intelligence information and then made predictions as to where and when a particular PAVN truck convoy would be geographically located. According to author John Prados, the system functioned &quot;exactly like a pinball machine... in truth, the mavens of the electronic battlefield became pinball wizards&quot;.

The effectiveness of the system was determined not by how long a sensor would last in the field, but by the adequacy of coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, only as good as the human analysts and operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.

The sensors were delivered to the target areas by U.S. Navy OP-2 Neptunes of VO-67 or by U.S. Air Force helicopters, both based at Nakhon Phanom. Due to increasing PAVN anti-aircraft artillery defences encountered in southeastern Laos, delivery in high-risk areas of the trail system was handed over from the Neptunes to Air Force F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers that had been specially equipped for the missions.

U.S. strike aircraft were directed to predicted target areas by a variety of means. The first was for the ISC to relay target information to an airborne battlefield command and control center (ABCCC), which then routed bombers to a forward air control aircraft (FAC). The FAC then led the strike to the target. During inclement weather or complete darkness, aircraft could still attack the trail by utilizing either MSQ-77 Combat Skyspot (a radar-directed system) or LORAN (a radio-directed navigational system).

As the program (and PAVN air defences) evolved, so did the relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too vulnerable and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.

== Operations in Laos ==

On 25 November 1967, &quot;Muscle Shoals&quot; began to undergo field testing and evaluation in southeastern Laos. This process was stopped by the battle of Khe Sanh, when an estimated three PAVN divisions approached, and then surrounded the Marine outpost in western Quang Tri Province adjacent to Laos. The U.S.
commander in Vietnam, General William C. Westmoreland, ordered Task Force Alpha to support the aerial effort to defend the base (Operation Niagara). On 22 January, the first of 316 sensors were implanted around and near Khe Sanh in 44 strings by Navy squadron VO-67. 

Although the Marine Direct Air Support Center was at first reluctant to trust the sensors (which in fact replaced ground patrolling), they were soon convinced of their utility. The Marines credited 40 percent of intelligence available to the Khe Sanh fire support coordination center to the sensors. General Westmoreland was ecstatic about Task Force Alpha&#x27;s contribution to the victory at Khe Sanh. He had been one of the few high-ranking military officers that had supported the barrier concept since its planning stages.

With the conclusion of aerial operations around Khe Sanh and the close out of the Marine base, the focus of &quot;Igloo White&quot; (as the operation was redesignated in June) turned once again to Laos. On 15 November 1968, the Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force had inaugurated Operation Commando Hunt, a series of continuous interdiction operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail that would continue until the end of American participation in the war. For the next four years &quot;Igloo White&quot; and &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; would be interlinked in the anti-infiltration effort.

With the advent of &quot;Igloo White&quot;/&quot;Commando Hunt&quot;, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. Armed reconnaissance – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That is not to say the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force was not about to surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh&#x27;s headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also under the control of the Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.

The only exception to this arrangement was Operation Commando Bolt, a real-time, LORAN-based technique which utilized sensor strike zones derived from predicted target locations. These missions were coordinated by Task Force Alpha&#x27;s &quot;Sycamore&quot; control center against targets that passed through strike modules (four strings of three to six sensors each). Air controllers at &quot;Sycamore&quot; then directly delivered the correct course, altitude, and speed necessary for the strike aircraft to deliver their ordnance to the correct coordinates.

There were some initial problems with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, there were so many aircraft piling up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.

The North Vietnamese response to the threat posed by the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system.

== Operations in South Vietnam ==
While the electronic barrier program in Laos became the most visible part of the anti-infiltration program, the physical barrier project in South Vietnam was largely abandoned after 1968 in favor of mobile operations. The SPOS outlined in the original &quot;Dyemarker&quot; plan envisioned a virtual defensive wall stretching from the South China Sea to Dong Ha Mountain. The plan called for a fence, a line of twin steel apron and barbed steel tape, an anti-personnel mine field, a passive sensor detection system, and another line of twin steel apron and barbed steel tape, to &quot;trace&quot; this path, providing a physical obstacle to enemy infiltration. Observation posts and towers would line the route, and six specifically designed strong points would be constructed, with associated battalion base areas. A combined force of a single US Marine Corps Regiment and a single ARVN Regiment were to man these positions.

The 3rd Naval Construction Battalion designed fighting and living bunkers for the route, presenting them for tests and evaluation 1968, both in CONUS and in Vietnam. Also, 28 January 1968, COMUSMACV provided its own guidance for the planned creation of the ARVN &quot;Dyemarker&quot; Regiment. COMUSMACV envisioned a Regiment of 5 4-company Battalions and an Armored Cavalry Squadron. On 30 January, COMUSMACV informed the commander of III MAF of their proposed mission to augment the proposed ARVN force manning the barrier. The ARVN 2nd Regiment, of its 1st Infantry Division became earmarked for the barrier mission.

On 29 October 1968, work was stopped on the physical SPOS barrier, by that time redesignated as &quot;Duel Blade&quot;, under MACV Planning Directive 10–67, citing changes in the overall force posture, both enemy and friendly. The physical barrier would be replaced by the revised &quot;Duel Blade&quot; plan of active resistance utilizing air strikes, artillery and naval bombardment and mobile reaction forces. Base sites already constructed or under construction were to be used as support bases for the revised operation plan.

== Other applications ==

Though Igloo White&#x27;s primary focus was monitoring traffic along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the DCPG&#x27;s mission had been expanded to include sensors for a &quot;wide range of tactical applications,&quot; as well as, a &quot;Ground Tactical System&quot; in 1968. The Ground Tactical System was envisioned as a tool for ground commanders in defending fire bases and other secured areas against attack, and was eventually employed around Khe Sanh. It was also noted that the US border patrol was testing the sensor equipment as a method of protecting US continental borders. Sensor equipment was deployed by July 1969 in South Vietnam for the purposes of countering boobytrapping and mining teams. A total of 56 sensors were diverted to the problem as a test, with testimony that vehicle losses were reduced by 50 percent in the first month.

== Conclusion ==
The stated goal of the American aerial interdiction campaigns was to force Hanoi to pay too high a price in blood to make the continued support of its goals in South Vietnam tenable. In this effort, the U.S. failed. Not only were the PAVN/NLF able to continue their efforts, but they managed, under a deluge of ordnance, to launch two major offensives (the Tet Offensive in 1968 and the &quot;Nguyen Hue Offensive&quot; [known in the West as the Easter Offensive] in 1972) and a counteroffensive (against Operation Lam Son 719 in 1971). The key to the failure of the American strategy was that the anti-infiltration campaigns targeted supplies and transportation (both of which were imported), instead of manpower. The price in casualties for the PAVN/NLF was high, but it was a price that Hanoi was able and willing to pay.

Chief among the criticisms leveled against the system was its failure to detect the build-up to PAVN&#x27;s 1972 &quot;Nguyen Hue Offensive&quot;. This cast doubt not only on the trustworthiness of the sensors, but on the adequacy of the entire system. The headquarters of the Pacific Air Force launched an investigation of the apparent failure and reported that &quot;our estimates were in error.&quot; The report went on to state, however, that the lapse was not the result any failure of the sensors themselves, but the Air Force&#x27;s false assumption that the trail net had adequate coverage.
The interdiction campaigns were also expensive. &quot;Igloo White&quot; cost around one billion dollars per year to operate. The cost of the bombing operations that the sensors supported amounted to approximately 18.2 million dollars per week. Those costs did not include the hundreds of aircraft lost during the interdiction campaigns or the crews that manned them.

Scholars today remain divided on the merits of the electronic barrier system and the efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable due to the fact that the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.

By the 1990s, new historical research (especially by Air Force historians Earl Tilford, Bernard Nalty, and Jacob Van Staaveren) and the publications of the Military Institute of Vietnam finally opened new perspectives on aerial interdiction during the Vietnam War. The Seventh Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks had been destroyed or damaged by air strikes during its tenure (with nineteen thousand of these occurring during Command Hunt V 1970–1971). While the North Vietnamese only imported 6,000 trucks into North Vietnam between 1968 and 1970 (for all of their operations), imports increased dramatically in 1971, though these also seem to have been as a result of the planned 1972 offensive. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started down the trail was destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to be altered in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.

Thomas C. Thayer, chief of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for four years during the war, believed that only about one-twentieth of the cargo imported into the north moved southward on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and that more than two-thirds eventually reached the battlefields in the south. More recently however, a new study by Air Force historian Eduard Mark established a correlation between trucks imported into North Vietnam during the war and those that were claimed by the American pilots as destroyed. Access to communist Vietnamese archives to scholarly research may add to the true effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the American electronic and aerial effort.

<doc id="955956" wikidata="Q603970" url="?curid=955956" title="Online Certificate Status Protocol">
<text>The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate. It is described in RFC 6960 and is on the Internet standards track. It was created as an alternative to certificate revocation lists (CRL), specifically addressing certain problems associated with using CRLs in a public key infrastructure (PKI). Messages communicated via OCSP are encoded in ASN.1 and are usually communicated over HTTP. The &quot;request/response&quot; nature of these messages leads to OCSP servers being termed &quot;OCSP responders&quot;.

Some web browsers (e.g., Firefox) use OCSP to validate HTTPS certificates, while others have disabled it. Most OCSP revocation statuses on the Internet disappear soon after certificate expiration.

Certificate authorities (CAs) were previously required by the CA/Browser Forum to provide OCSP service, but this requirement was removed in August 2023, instead making CRLs required again. Let&#x27;s Encrypt has announced that OCSP services will be shut down on August 6, 2025.

== Comparison to CRLs ==
* Since an OCSP response contains less data than a typical certificate revocation list (CRL), it puts less burden on network and client resources.
* Since an OCSP response has less data to parse, the client-side libraries that handle it can be less complex than those that handle CRLs.
* OCSP discloses to the responder that a particular network host used a particular certificate at a particular time. OCSP does not mandate encryption, so other parties may intercept this information.

== Basic PKI implementation ==
# Alice and Bob have public key certificates issued by Carol, the certificate authority (CA).
# Alice wishes to perform a transaction with Bob and sends him her certificate.
# Bob, concerned that Alice&#x27;s private key may have been compromised, creates an &#x27;OCSP request&#x27; that contains Alice&#x27;s certificate serial number and sends it to Carol.
# Carol&#x27;s OCSP responder reads the certificate serial number from Bob&#x27;s request. The OCSP responder uses the certificate serial number to look up the revocation status of Alice&#x27;s certificate. The OCSP responder looks in a CA database that Carol maintains. In this scenario, Carol&#x27;s CA database is the only trusted location where a compromise to Alice&#x27;s certificate would be recorded.
# Carol&#x27;s OCSP responder confirms that Alice&#x27;s certificate is still OK, and returns a signed, successful &#x27;OCSP response&#x27; to Bob.
# Bob cryptographically verifies Carol&#x27;s signed response. Bob has stored Carol&#x27;s public key some time before this transaction. Bob uses Carol&#x27;s public key to verify Carol&#x27;s response.

An OCSP responder (a server typically run by the certificate issuer) may return a signed response signifying that the certificate specified in the request is &#x27;good&#x27;, &#x27;revoked&#x27;, or &#x27;unknown&#x27;. If it cannot process the request, it may return an error code.

The OCSP request format supports additional extensions. This enables extensive customization to a particular PKI scheme.

OCSP can be vulnerable to replay attacks, where a signed, &#x27;good&#x27; response is captured by a malicious intermediary and replayed to the client at a later date after the subject certificate may have been revoked. OCSP allows a nonce to be included in the request that may be included in the corresponding response. Because of high load, most OCSP responders do not use the nonce extension to create a different response for each request, instead using presigned responses with a validity period of multiple days. Thus, the replay attack is a major threat to validation systems.

OCSP can support more than one level of CA. OCSP requests may be chained between peer responders to query the issuing CA appropriate for the subject certificate, with responders validating each other&#x27;s responses against the root CA using their own OCSP requests.

An OCSP responder may be queried for revocation information by delegated path validation (DPV) servers. OCSP does not, by itself, perform any DPV of supplied certificates.

The key that signs a response need not be the same key that signed the certificate. The certificate&#x27;s issuer may delegate another authority to be the OCSP responder. In this case, the responder&#x27;s certificate (the one that is used to sign the response) must be issued by the issuer of the certificate in question, and must include a certain extension that marks it as an OCSP signing authority (more precisely, an extended key usage extension with the OID {iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) keyPurpose(3) ocspSigning(9)})

== Privacy concerns ==
OCSP checking creates a privacy concern for some users, since it requires the client to contact a third party (albeit a party trusted by the client software vendor) to confirm certificate validity. This third party could thus track what websites the client is accessing. OCSP stapling is a way to verify validity without disclosing browsing behavior to the CA.

== Criticisms ==
OCSP-based revocation is not an effective technique to mitigate against the compromise of an HTTPS server&#x27;s private key. An attacker who has compromised a server&#x27;s private key typically needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position on the network to abuse that private key and impersonate a server. An attacker in such a position is also typically in a position to interfere with the client&#x27;s OCSP queries. Because most clients will silently ignore OCSP if the query times out, OCSP is not a reliable means of mitigating HTTPS server key compromise.

The MustStaple TLS extension in a certificate can require that the certificate be verified by a stapled OCSP response, mitigating this problem. OCSP also remains a valid defense against situations where the attacker is not a &quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; (code-signing or certificates issued in error).

The OCSP protocol assumes the requester has network access to connect to an appropriate OCSP responder. Some requesters may not be able to connect because their local network prohibits direct Internet access (a common practice for internal nodes in a data center). Forcing internal servers to connect to the Internet in order to use OCSP contributes to the de-perimeterisation trend. The OCSP stapling protocol is an alternative that allows servers to cache OCSP responses, which removes the need for the requestor to directly contact the OCSP responder.

== Browser support ==

There is wide support for OCSP amongst most major browsers:
* Internet Explorer is built on the CryptoAPI of Windows and thus starting with version 7 on Windows Vista (not XP) supports OCSP checking.
* All versions of Mozilla Firefox support OCSP checking. Firefox 3 enables OCSP checking by default.
* Safari on macOS supports OCSP checking. It is enabled by default as of Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion). Prior to that, it has to be manually activated in Keychain preferences.
* Versions of Opera from 8.0 to the current version support OCSP checking.
However, Google Chrome is an outlier. Google disabled OCSP checks by default in 2012, citing latency and privacy issues and instead uses their own update mechanism to send revoked certificates to the browser.

== Implementations ==

Several open source and proprietary OCSP implementations exist, including fully featured servers and libraries for building custom applications. OCSP client support is built into many operating systems, web browsers, and other network software due to the popularity of HTTPS and the World Wide Web.

<text>K&#x27;Nex is a construction toy system created by Joel Glockman. It was first introduced in America in 1992. K&#x27;Nex is designed and produced by K&#x27;Nex Industries Inc. of Hatfield, Pennsylvania. K&#x27;Nex was purchased by Florida-based company Basic Fun! in 2018.

The toy&#x27;s building system consists of interlocking plastic rods, connectors, glocks, gears, wheels, and other components, which can be assembled to form a wide variety of models, machines, and architectural structures. While K&#x27;Nex is designed for children ages 5–12, a bigger version, Kid K&#x27;Nex, is aimed towards children 12 and younger.

==History==
The first K&#x27;Nex Box was launched in the U.S. market in 1993. Original models with moving parts had a handcrank to make things move, but soon, gears and motors allowed models to move on their own.

The company&#x27;s products were sold at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, starting in early October 1992. By 2011, K&#x27;Nex was distributed in over 25 countries, including the United States.

In 2018, all of K&#x27;Nex&#x27;s assets were purchased by Basic Fun!, a Florida-based toy company. The acquisition was valued at around $21 million.

In 2024, Basic Fun filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company will use bankruptcy proceedings to repay its creditors while remaining in operation. Basic Fun emerged from bankruptcy on November 1, 2024.

==Pieces==
The basic K&#x27;Nex pieces used to make models include rods, connectors, and bricks. Basic K&#x27;Nex pieces are made out of polyoxymethylene plastic.

==Display models and exhibits==
Concordia University&#x27;s Engineering and Computer Science Association (ECA) has erected models of a Space Shuttle, the Sears Tower, the Eiffel Tower, Habitat 67, and mazes out of K&#x27;Nex. The U.S. Space and Rocket Center held a Guinness Book of World Records Award for the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest K&#x27;Nex Sculpture&quot; and also has a huge space shuttle and rocket in their gift shop in Huntsville, Alabama. The Guinness World Record for &quot;World&#x27;s Largest K&#x27;Nex Sculpture&quot; was broken in 2014 by a team in the UK with a 13.38-meter-long K&#x27;Nex replica of the Bloodhound 1600 km/h Supersonic Car. K&#x27;Nex also has a traveling exhibit, K&#x27;Nex: Build Thrill Rides, that visits schools and museums across the country.

==Computer games==
&quot;K&#x27;NEX The Lost Mines: Adventure Begins&quot;, was released in 1998 by EAI Interactive for Windows 95, and &quot;Virtual K&#x27;Nex&quot; was also released in 1998 by Fox Interactive for Windows 3.x.

<doc id="955962" wikidata="Q5136854" url="?curid=955962" title="Clyde 1">
<text>Clyde 1 is an Independent Local Radio station based in Glasgow, Scotland, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Glasgow and West Central Scotland. 

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 747,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

== History ==
Clyde 1 was born out of the compulsory transmission splitting enforced by the UK regulators in the 1990s, developing the FM frequency into Radio Clyde into a Top-40 format radio station.

The development of live-streaming and digital radio led to a widening of the station&#x27;s potential audience through carriage on the station&#x27;s website and Bauer Radio&#x27;s DAB multiplex in Glasgow.

The station&#x27;s Freeview carriage came as a consequence of the closure of stable-mate 3C by the station&#x27;s then-owners, and resulted in UK-wide coverage until it was removed on 30 October 2008.

==Events==
Clyde 1 used to hold an event called &quot;Clyde 1 Live&quot; at the SECC in Glasgow.
The event included some of the many artists which are broadcast on the station, past events have featured Calvin Harris, Labrinth, Jessie J, Olly Murs, The Sugababes, Amelia Lily, Pixie Lott, Mcfly, Lawson, Cover Drive, Matt Cardle, Gary Barlow, John Newman, The Vamps and also Dappy.

On 5 February 2024, it was announced that &quot;Clyde 1 Live&quot; would return to celebrate the station&#x27;s 50th anniversary. This event took place on 31 May 2024 at the OVO Hydro, with 12,500 people in attendance. Clyde 1 presenter George Bowie performed one of his GBX sets, with fellow presenters Cassi Gillespie and Callum Gallacher performing DJ sets as well. Acts included Texas, Tom Walker, Amy Macdonald, Emeli Sandé, Callum Beattie and Nathan Evans.

==Programming==
The majority of programming - local and networked - is produced and broadcast from Radio Clyde&#x27;s studios in Clydebank, however some networked output originates from Forth 1 in Edinburgh, Tay FM in Dundee and sister station Hits Radio in Manchester. The station also opts out of some networked output to broadcast additional local programming, including sports coverage and specialist music shows.

The station&#x27;s local presenters include George Bowie (&quot;Bowie at Breakfast&quot;/&quot;The GB Xperience&quot;), Garry Spence, Grant Thomson, Steven Mill and Cassi Gillespie (&quot;Bowie at Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Sunday afternoons&quot;).

===News and sport===
Clyde 1 broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6a.m. to 7p.m. on weekdays and from 7a.m. to 1p.m. at weekends. Headlines are broadcast on the half hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside sport and traffic bulletins.

The Clydebank newsroom also produces bespoke national Scottish bulletins at weekends with Sky News Radio bulletins carried overnight. Radio Clyde&#x27;s head of news and sport is Lorraine Herbison, who is also Bauer&#x27;s head of news for its Scottish stations.

Sports coverage airs under the &quot;Superscoreboard&quot; banner and includes live match reports during the season and a magazine show on weekday evenings. It is presented by Gordon Duncan and features regular panellists Hugh Keevins and Gordon Dalziel.

<text>Moloko () were an English-Irish electronic music duo formed in Sheffield, England, consisting of vocalist Róisín Murphy and producer Mark Brydon. Blending elements of electronica and dance music, they are best known for their UK top 10 singles &quot;The Time Is Now&quot; (2000) and &quot;Familiar Feeling&quot; (2003), as well as the 1999 Boris Dlugosch remix of &quot;Sing It Back&quot; which became an international hit.

==History==

=== Formation and success (1994–2000) ===
Murphy had no prior professional singing experience when Moloko was formed, while Brydon had previously worked on music as a producer with musicians such as Boy George and Cabaret Voltaire on releases from the 1990s. In 1994, the two met at a party in Sheffield, where Murphy approached Brydon with the chat-up line, &quot;Do you like my tight sweater? See how it fits my body!&quot; Its first sentence became their debut album&#x27;s title, recorded while the pair had begun dating. The name Moloko comes from the narcotic-filled milk drink, Moloko Plus, in the Anthony Burgess novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, based on the Russian word for milk, &quot;&quot; (&quot;moloko&quot;).

The group signed to Echo Records and released their single &quot;Where Is the What If the What Is in Why?&quot; The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Do You Like My Tight Sweater?&quot; was released in 1995. The group toured with Pulp following the release. The single &quot;Fun for Me&quot; was featured prominently on the &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; soundtrack and received radio airplay and strong MTV rotation. It reached number four in the US Dance chart. In 1997, their cover of &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; featured on the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot;.

After Moloko finished the tour, they built a home studio and recorded their second album, titled &quot;I Am Not a Doctor&quot;, which was released in 1998 in the United Kingdom. Though the album was unsuccessful, reaching only number 64 in the UK Albums Chart, a Boris Dlugosch remix of &quot;Sing It Back&quot;, the third single from the album that originally failed to reach the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart, was a huge hit, reaching number four in the UK chart and number one in the US Dance Chart. Moloko toured in support of the album, opening for Garbage in UK and Ireland in January and February 1999. 

Their third album &quot;Things to Make and Do&quot; was released in the year 2000 and reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. The first single, &quot;The Time Is Now&quot; was their biggest hit, charting at number two in the charts. They started touring as a full band along with percussionist Paul Slowly, keyboardist Eddie Stevens, and guitarist Dave Cooke.

=== &quot;Statues&quot; and disbandment (2003–2004) ===
Their 2003 album &quot;Statues&quot; produced two hit singles, &quot;Familiar Feeling&quot;, which reached number ten in the UK, and &quot;Forever More&quot;, which reached number 17. Brydon and Murphy ended their romantic relationship in 2002, just before they began work on the album. Murphy toured without Brydon for eighteen months in support of the album throughout 2003 and 2004. The concert at the Brixton Academy, recorded on 22 November 2003, was released on the live DVD &quot;11,000 Clicks&quot; in 2004. Following the tour, the group disbanded.

=== Post-disbandment (2004–present) ===
Following the disbandment, both Murphy and Brydon began solo careers, with the former releasing her first solo album, &quot;Ruby Blue&quot;, in 2005. 

On 22 May 2006, the band announced their greatest hits album &quot;Catalogue&quot;, including the unreleased track &quot;Bankrupt Emotionally&quot;, released on 17 July. The same year, Murphy and Brydon, along with long-time Moloko guitarist Cooke, briefly interrupted their hiatus to play a select number of acoustic radio performances.

In 2016, Moloko digitally reissued their remixes on the compilation &quot;All Back To the Mine&quot;, split into two volumes and comprising a total of 68 tracks.

In 2019, the four Moloko albums were remastered and reissued on vinyl.

Since the band&#x27;s disbandment, Murphy has performed several Moloko songs on her solo tours and live performances. However, she has stated in several interviews that she has no intention of reuniting with Brydon.

==Style==
Moloko&#x27;s music has been described as alternative dance, dance-pop, experimental pop, dance-punk and electropop. Heather Phares of AllMusic described the sound of their debut album similar to that of Portishead and Massive Attack with elements of dance, funk, and trip hop, while noting the group had &quot;a sense of humour and sass unique to Moloko.&quot;

<text>The Bank of East Asia Limited, often abbreviated to BEA, is a Hong Kong public banking and financial services company headquartered in Central, Hong Kong. It is currently the largest independent local Hong Kong bank, and one of two remaining family-run Hong Kong banks, with the other being Dah Sing Bank. It continues to be run by the 3rd and 4th generations of the Li family.

It was incorporated as a publicly listed bank in Hong Kong on 14 November 1918, and officially opened for business on 4 January 1919, by a group of local Hong Kong Chinese businessmen who &quot;not only understood modern banking, but the needs of modern Chinese business.&quot; Essentially, it aimed to serve local Hong Kong citizens and businesses who were currently underserved by the large British banks and small, unorganized, and often unincorporated local Hong Kong moneylenders. By the 1930s, BEA was considered the most influential local Hong Kong bank in the city.

==History==

=== Origins, and until 2008 ===
BEA was co-founded in Hong Kong on 14 November 1918 and officially opened for business on 4 January 1919. The idea of a local Hong Kong bank to blend East and West, essentially by embracing the style of a Chinese, family-run bank but also adopting modern accounting and banking methods, came from Kan Tong-po (). Kan had the necessary banking background but needed the financial support of the Li brothers (Li Koon-chun and Li Tse-fong) and the sociopolitical support of Sir Shouson Chow, who would become co-founders, along with several other prominent local Hong Kong Chinese businessmen, including Fung Ping Shan ().

While Kan later sold his stake in the bank in the run-up to Hong Kong&#x27;s handover, the Li family&#x27;s influence in the bank continues to run deep today, with Sir David Li (3rd generation) being chairman, and his sons Adrian Li and Brian Li (4th generation) being co-CEOs.

BEA expanded rapidly internationally after opening. In 1920, just one year after the bank&#x27;s official opening, BEA opened its first branches outside of Hong Kong, in Shanghai and Ho Chi Minh City. In 1952, BEA opened its Singapore branch, located in Raffles Place at 60 Robinson Road. BEA would later enter the North American market in 1991 (though operations would later be sold to Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in January 2010), and mainland China in 1992.

The late 1930s to 1940s were tough on the bank, as the Second Sino-Japanese War and later Japanese occupation of Hong Kong resulted in heavy losses, with many of BEA&#x27;s assets seized. Even after the war, the Chinese Civil War and later the United Nations embargo on China negatively affected Hong Kong&#x27;s economy, and as a result, BEA.

In 1965, Hong Kong experienced a city-wide banking crisis which saw other local Hong Kong banks suffer bank runs and hostile takeovers, such as Hang Seng Bank. BEA, however, was undisturbed but became much more conservative thereafter.

In 1984, after the Sino-British Joint Declaration, BEA refused to follow the lead of many leading firms at the time to move their headquarters overseas, and instead decided to double down and reaffirm their &quot;Hong Kong roots&quot;.

Traditionally more focused on internal growth rather than external acquisitions, in 1995, BEA made its first acquisition when it acquired United Chinese Bank (), with the merger being completed in 2001. BEA also acquired First Pacific Bank in 2000, and that merger was completed in 2002.

=== 2008 to 2018 ===
On 24 September 2008, BEA experienced a serious test in the form of the worst bank run in its history. BEA had to issue a statement to counter &quot;malicious rumours&quot; about its stability, as queues of customers seeking to withdraw funds formed outside some of its Hong Kong branches. It condemned the rumour mongers, declaring that it had sufficient funds to meet customers&#x27; requests, and noting that its capital adequacy ratio was above the industry average, at 14.6 percent. A statement by Joseph Yam, the then chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, dismissed the rumour and strongly supported the bank, adding that funds would be made available to the bank if required but that no request had been made. Earlier in the week, the bank had been forced to restate its previous half-year&#x27;s earnings downwards by nearly 12 percent after it was revealed that one of its staff had conducted unauthorised trades and then buried the losses.

In October 2015, BEA entered into agreement with Sinopac Securities to sell BEA Wealth Management Services (Taiwan) Limited and Tung Shing Holdings Company Limited. BEA chairman and CEO David Li said that the disposals would allow BEA to rationalise its securities business in Greater China region. There was no disclosure of the transaction amount involved in this sales.

As the banking sector and BEA continued to face challenges, BEA launched a 3-year cost-cutting plan in the beginning of 2016 to save HKD 700 million by 2018, by reducing dividend payouts, controlling costs, and trimming assets. The saving target was about 8% of its cost base in 2015. It was expected that 40% of savings coming from business alignment, 25% from restructuring middle to back offices, and remaining via branch automation and streamlining. By June 2016, BEA already slashed 180 jobs and closed down 22 securities brokerages outlets. Other key assets sold during this period of cost cutting included its holdings in Tricor, a professional services firm to private equity firm Permira for HKD 6.47 billion (profit of HKD 3.1 billion), and various consumer finance assets to China moneylender QL Finance for HKD 1.08 billion.

On 29 June 2018, after 34 years of being a constituent of the Hang Seng Index, BEA was cut during the quarterly review of Hang Seng Index composition, effective 10 September 2018. The index said that the Bank of East Asia did not meet the turnover and market capitalisation minimums.

In late 2018, BEA began to venture into investment banking by setting up a debt capital markets team based in Hong Kong.

=== Since 2019 ===
BEA began 2019 by celebrating its centennial on 2 January 2019, with a reception at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre attended by various business and political leaders from Hong Kong.

On 1 July 2019, David Li stepped down as CEO after 38 years (but still retaining his Chairmanship), and was replaced by his sons Adrian and Brian Li as co-CEO&#x27;s.

BEA faced a difficult 2019, with loan writedowns in China and unprecedented scale of protests in Hong Kong affecting business.

==Business segmentation==
BEA trades through the following segments:

*Corporate banking
*Personal banking
*Wealth management
*Insurance and retirement benefits
*Treasury markets
*China
*International divisions

==Headquarters==
From 1918 to 1920, the bank was headquartered in 2 Des Voeux Road Central, in Central, Hong Kong. In 1920, the bank moved its headquarters to the 29-storey Bank of East Asia Building (東亞銀行大廈) located at 10 Des Voeux Road Central, standing between New Henry House and The Landmark.

The Bank of East Asia Building has had multiple rebuilds over the years:

* First generation (1920 to 1933) 
* Second generation (1935 to 1980)
* Third generation (1982 to present)

==Mainland China operations==
Bank of East Asia began its mainland China business in 1992, and in 2007, was among the 4 foreign banks approved by China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) to establish a locally incorporated bank, the Bank of East Asia (China) Ltd (BEA China).

On 20 May 2008, BEA became a foreign bank that issued yuan-denominated debit cards in mainland China, taking advantage of the recent removal of a key restriction on foreign banks&#x27; retail business in the country. The bank issued the debit cards jointly with China UnionPay, the country&#x27;s only bankcard network operator. The company claimed that the launch of debit cards would help attract retail banking customers by giving them greater convenience in accessing their deposits. In addition, it offers direct Alipay payment support and issues credit cards (RMB-denominated UnionPay credit cards in 2008, and more recently Visa-branded US dollar-denominated cards in April 2011).

BEA currently operate one of the most extensive networks in mainland China for a foreign bank.

BEA operates overseas in several locations serving expatriate Hong Kong residents.

BEA operates overseas branches in the following countries and markets:

*Macau
*Malaysia
*Singapore
*Taiwan
*United States

==Disputes and incidents==

===Elliott Management===
Hedge fund activist investor Elliott Management filed a lawsuit against BEA in July 2016 in Hong Kong court over a share placement transaction. Elliott Management, which held 7% of listed shares of BEA, had included majority of the bank&#x27;s directors, its CEO and chairman in the lawsuit. The transaction in question was on BEA&#x27;s issuance of new shares to Japan&#x27;s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) in 2015. Elliott cited &quot;allegations of unfairly prejudicial conduct&quot; and &quot;alleged serious corporate governance failings&quot;. Elliott hoped to secure a declaration from the court that these placements were passed by BEA for &quot;an improper purpose&quot; and looked for an order requiring BEA to lift the contractual restrictions that would prevent SMBC and Caixa, another strategic investor on BEA, from reducing their stakes on BEA.

In response, BEA applied to have Elliott&#x27;s petition against them struck out. This case was heard by Mr Justice Jonathan Harris from 17 to 19 July 2017.

=== 2019–20 Hong Kong protests ===
During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, several BEA outlets were accidentally targeted as protestors vandalized mainland-linked business. Protestors later spray-painted &quot;Sorry&quot; at the vandalized branches, after they realized BEA is locally run and owned.

<text>Forth 1 is an Independent Local Radio station based in Edinburgh, Scotland, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Edinburgh, Lothian, Fife and Falkirk.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 383,000 listeners according to RAJAR. 

==History==

Radio Forth was launched on 22 January 1975 by current chairman Richard Findlay. His opening speech included &quot;This, for the very first time is Radio Forth&quot;. Steve Hamilton was the first on-air presenter, hosting the breakfast show.

In 1990, Forth was forced to create a new station on its AM frequency. Before this, Radio Forth was broadcast as a single station on both FM and AM frequencies. The FM station was renamed Radio Forth RFM (later simplified to Forth FM) with Donny Hughes broadcasting the first Breakfast Show from the newly revamped Studio F in Forth House. The new AM station became &quot;Max AM&quot; which was later renamed &quot;Forth AM&quot; to match its sister station.

In 2000, both stations were relaunched as &quot;97.3 Forth One&quot; and &quot;1548 Forth 2&quot;. Forth 2 was redesigned as an adult contemporary music station while Forth One continued to play Top 40 songs for the 35s and under.

Radio Forth was owned by Scottish Radio Holdings until 3 June 2005 when British media group EMAP took over. In January 2008, EMAP Radio was sold to Bauer and the radio division was renamed Bauer Radio. Ownership changes have led to more networked programming on the station.

On Friday 17 June 2022, Forth 1 broadcast from their studios at Forth House for the final time. During the breakfast show at 7.45 the station played a farewell montage before walking to their new studios at St James Quarter where the first link was broadcast just after 8am. The first song played from the new studios was &#x27;New Emotion&#x27; by The Time Frequency.

On 6 January 2025, Forth 1’s breakfast show expanded, replacing MFR, Northsound 1 and Tay FM’s separate local breakfast shows.

==Programming==
Local programming &#x27;Boogie in the Morning&#x27; is produced and broadcast from Radio Forth&#x27;s Edinburgh studios based within St James Quarter shopping centre from 6am-10am Monday-Friday. The station also produces networked programming on Saturday mornings - &quot;Boogie and Arlene, also The Big Saturday Football Show with Steven Mill &amp; Ewen Cameron and Sunday Evenings with Micky Gavin and Garry Spence every weekday on Drivetime. &quot;

Forth 1 also airs networked programming from Clyde 1 in Glasgow and Hits Radio in London &amp; Manchester.
===News ===
Forth 1 broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am to 7pm on weekdays and from 7am to 1pm at weekends. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside sport and traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked Scottish bulletins at weekends, produced from Radio Clyde&#x27;s newsroom in Clydebank.

<doc id="955995" wikidata="Q2260684" url="?curid=955995" title="Before These Crowded Streets">
<text>Before These Crowded Streets is the third studio album by the American rock band Dave Matthews Band. It was released on April 28, 1998, through RCA Records. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, his last collaboration with the group until 2012&#x27;s &quot;Away from the World&quot;. Recording took place at The Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, California and Electric Lady Studios in New York.

Taking its title from a line in &quot;The Dreaming Tree&quot;, the album marked a shift in the band&#x27;s sound, having darker themes and textures and more complex arrangements. Certain songs see the band apply polyrhythms and Middle-Eastern scales. Numerous guests are featured on the album, including Béla Fleck, Alanis Morissette and the Kronos Quartet. Additionally, guitarist Tim Reynolds guests on every track; he would later join the band as a full-time member. Lyrically, the album tackles both personal and socio-political themes, such as war in &quot;The Last Stop&quot; and the slaughter of Native Americans in &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot;.

&quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; was a critical and commercial success. The album debuted at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 421,000 units in its first week of release and knocking the &quot;Titanic&quot; soundtrack from the top of the chart after a run of 16 consecutive weeks at number one. Three singles were released from the album—&quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot;, &quot;Stay (Wasting Time)&quot;, and &quot;Crush&quot;—all of which received varying levels of commercial success.

==Background==

At the end of many tracks on the album, there are &quot;musical interludes&quot; most of which consist of small jams or outtakes not developed into full songs:

*A clip in which LeRoi Moore is heard answering his cell phone follows &quot;Rapunzel.&quot;
*A clip of flute music follows &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water.&quot;
*A string passage by the Kronos Quartet serves as a segue from &quot;Halloween&quot; to &quot;The Stone.&quot;
*An outtake featuring Bela Fleck and Alanis Morissette follows &quot;The Stone.&quot;
*A clip of &quot;Doobie Thing,&quot; an early DMB instrumental song, follows &quot;The Dreaming Tree.&quot;
*A clip of &quot;Anyone Seen the Bridge?&quot;, a live show transition song, and a short excerpt of &quot;Deed is Done,&quot; an unreleased song from the previous tour, follows &quot;Pig.&quot;
*A clip now referred to as &quot;The Last Stop Reprise&quot; follows &quot;Spoon.&quot;

===Excluded songs===
Songs that were recorded during the sessions, but were not included on the final cut:
*&quot;Help Myself&quot; – Licensed for the &quot;Scream 2&quot; soundtrack in lieu of &quot;Halloween&quot;, which the band decided was too good to leave off the album.
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Burn the Pig&quot; – Evolved into &quot;Pig&quot; during the sessions.
*&quot;Get in Line&quot;
*&quot;MacHead&quot;
*&quot;#40 (Always)&quot;

====MacHead====
&quot;MacHead&quot; was a song recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions, but it was never completed, so did not make the album. Producer Steve Lillywhite named the song, claiming it sounded like a cross between the sound of Paul McCartney and Radiohead. The song&#x27;s existence is only known from an image on the 1999 fan calendar with a list of the working titles of the other songs on this album and from an alleged meeting in which Jake Vigliotti claims to have heard said recording.

Some fans familiar with the idea of &quot;MacHead&quot; speculated it had been developed, renamed, and added to the band&#x27;s catalog. They speculate that &quot;MacHead&quot; developed into &quot;Bartender&quot;, which debuted in January 1999 at a Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds concert just months after the April &#x27;98 release of Before These Crowded Streets. In November 2009, Jake Vigliotti claims to have heard 6 different demo takes of &quot;Machead&quot; from an early 1997 recording session for the album, effectively confirming its existence to the fan community.

In a 2010 interview with Cali from CBS Radio, Stefan Lessard was asked to give his thoughts on Machead. He replied that &quot;Machead&#x27;s this little number that I believe was the last song to possibly make it on &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; and I think there&#x27;s a recording I have of it somewhere. So it&#x27;s just finding a recording of it and listening to it and that&#x27;s on our homework list.&quot; Although as of July 2024, no official recording has surfaced, a demo recording has leaked and has been spread among fans.

==Reception==
&quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Writing for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, J. D. Considine stated that with the album, the band had &quot;improved on every level&quot;, praising the writing, playing and ambition of the arrangements. Additionally, he praised the band for integrating many guests on the album and for &quot;broadening [their] palette&quot;. Mark Weingarten, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, highlighted the tracks &quot;Rapunzel&quot; and &quot;The Stone&quot; in particular for their &quot;vertiginous polyrhythms and serpentine riffs that dart around Matthew&#x27;s clenched vocals, yet always manage to lock into an enjoyable groove.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that despite the &quot;songwriting remain[ing] a problem&quot; and finding Matthews&#x27; lyrics occasionally &quot;embarrassing&quot;, the album&#x27;s &quot;sonic daring results in the most satisfying album they&#x27;ve yet recorded.&quot; Another retrospective review came from &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Jason P. Woodbury, who wrote that it &quot;remains DMB&#x27;s most experimental album, a crossroads in the band&#x27;s history&quot; and stated that it &quot;explores the uneasy zone between celebratory anthems and grim lamentations&quot;.

<text>Gonepteryx rhamni, commonly named the common brimstone, is a butterfly of the family Pieridae. It lives throughout the Palearctic zone and is commonly found across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Across much of its range, it is the only species of its genus, and is therefore simply known locally as the brimstone. Its wing span size is . It should not be confused with the brimstone moth &quot;Opisthograptis luteolata&quot;.

The brimstone relies on two species of buckthorn plants as host plants for its larvae; this influences its geographic range and distribution, as these plants are commonly found in wetlands. The adult brimstone travels to woodland areas to spend seven months overwintering. In spring when their host plants have developed, they return to the wetlands to breed and lay eggs. Both the larval and adult forms of the common brimstone have protective coloration and behaviour that decreases their chances of being recognised and subsequently preyed upon.

The adult common brimstone has sexual dimorphism in its wing coloration: males have yellow wings and iridescence while females have greenish-white wings and are not iridescent. This iridescence is affected by environmental factors.

==Taxonomy==
It was first described and published in Linnaeus&#x27;s book, the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758.

Brimstone is an old name for sulphur, the colour which matches the colour of the male&#x27;s wings.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The common brimstone can be commonly found throughout the Palearctic. Individuals have been seen from western Europe to east Asia. The high mobility of this butterfly allows it to search widely for new host plant locations and expand its range. While the geographic distribution of the adult is larger than that of its host plant, its range is nevertheless limited by the presence of host plants due to the needs of its larval stage.

The common brimstone uses various environments for different stages of its life cycle. The butterfly inhabits wetlands during mating and breeding season, as they provide ideal areas for oviposition due to an abundance of host plants like the alder buckthorn. The common brimstone prefers laying eggs on younger host plants with late bud-bursts that are isolated from other plants in the area and exposed to both open space and sun. During the winter, adult brimstones travel to woodlands to hibernate, as they provide ideal overwintering sites with shelters such as evergreen foliage and holly. The common brimstone has an appearance that is highly similar to the leaves of these plants, so during hibernation it can remain hidden. In other seasons, habitat selection is also affected by the abundance of nectar as a food source for adult brimstones.

== Food resources ==
=== Caterpillar ===
Larval brimstones appear to feed on only two plant sources: the alder buckthorn (&quot;Frangula alnus&quot;) and the common buckthorn (&quot;Rhamnus carthartica)&quot;. This influences the distribution of the adult brimstone, as the presence of these two buckthorn species is necessary for the survival of their offspring.

=== Adult ===
Unlike their larval forms, which are specialised for particular host plants, adult brimstones are not specialised nectar feeders. The common brimstone heavily feeds on the nectar of several flowering species including knapweed (&quot;Centaurea jacea&quot;) and scabious (&quot;Knautia arvensis&quot; and &quot;Succisa pratensis&quot;). However, brimstones have also been observed feeding on the nectar of coltsfoot (&quot;Tussilago farfara&quot;) in April and May and have been recorded gathering nectar from many other species of flowers. Adult food plant availability is another factor that is important for habitat selection.

== Parental care ==
=== Oviposition ===
The common brimstone is univoltine, meaning that it lays one generation of eggs each year. There are several ideal characteristics of the particular host plants chosen for oviposition. Adult brimstones lay eggs on the underside of the leaves of the two species of host plants, where they are less conspicuous. The high mobility of &quot;G. rhamni&quot; enables the butterflies to find even the most isolated host plants in an area, which are more ideal for their offspring. Eggs are more likely to be deposited on outlying plants, leading to reduced vulnerability as fewer predators are attracted to these plants. Another factor is damage; undamaged plants indicate the absence of other eggs, as brimstone larvae leave holes in the leaves of the plants on which they feed. Since predators and parasites are attracted to damaged plants through chemical or visual signals, less damage leads to greater offspring survival since eggs are less likely to be detected. Plants exposed to both sunlight and the open lead to reduced chances of predation and parasitism as well, and are more accessible to adult butterflies. Larvae can also benefit from decreased host plant defences; juvenile plants and plants with late bud-bursts produce fewer toxic defence chemicals, as resources are directed more towards plant growth.

== Life cycle ==
The common brimstone is one of the longest-living butterflies, with a life expectancy ranging from 10 months to a year. Due to its hibernation and life cycle, it has one generation per year. Development from the laid egg to the emergence of the imago is approximately 50 days. However, the adult brimstone spends a large portion of its life in an overwintering state. The brimstone is highly mobile, feeding and travelling to regions ideal for hibernation during the late summer and fall, and returning to regions ideal for mating and egg-laying during the spring.

=== Egg ===
Adult common brimstones lay eggs singly on the underside of buckthorn leaves. The eggs are around 1.3 mm tall, and are spindle-shaped in appearance. The eggs change colour over time, initially having a greenish-white colouration, then progressively darker shades of yellow, and finally brown before hatching.

=== Caterpillar ===
The larvae of the common brimstone undergo five instars, initially having a length of 1.7 mm in the first instar and reaching up to 34.9 mm in length when fully grown. The caterpillars have a green colouration with white hairs and dark tubercules across its length. When they first hatch, they move to the top side of the leaves and eat them, leaving characteristic hole patterns in their host plants. During the day, they feed and then rest in the open, lying still on the midrib of leaves, where their colouration makes them difficult to distinguish.

=== Pupa ===
Pupation occurs over approximately two weeks. The pupae are 22.2-23.8 mm in length and have the appearance of a curled leaf, with pointed ends and bulges in the middle. The pupae are secured to stems and leaves using silk; a cremastral hook attaches to a silk padding, and a length of silk secures the pupae around its middle. The pupae have a primarily green colouration, but right before adult emergence for males, the wing areas turn yellow.

=== Adult ===
Adults emerge during the summer, from June to August, and continue to feed until September. The common brimstone hibernates for the next seven months of winter, remaining inactive until April, where they then emerge and proceed to reproduce and lay eggs. Adult brimstones are highly abundant for several months after their emergence from overwintering. The common brimstone has sexual dichromism, with males having a sulphur yellow wing colouration and females having a greenish-white wing colouration. Additionally, males have iridescent dorsal wings that change in colour and appearance under ultraviolet light, while females do not. Both males and females have orange spots in the discoidal cell of each wing, pink head and antennae, and a thorax covered in white hair.
== Migration ==
The common brimstone undergoes some regional migration between hibernation and breeding areas throughout the year, as seen in the different chemical composition of butterflies across varying seasons and regions. In general, there is movement towards wetlands to reproduce. After the eggs hatch, develop, and pupate, newly hatched adult butterflies emerge and disperse locally into both woodlands and wetlands to overwinter. Butterflies travel to the woodlands for overwintering, and no mating appears to occur within these habitats. Overwintering also occurs in the wetlands, where the host plant alder buckthorn is abundant. After emerging from overwintering, adult brimstones that were previously in the wetlands are joined by those that hibernated in woodlands, and the population breeds and lays eggs.

The environmental conditions of a particular year also affect migration, as seen in the elevational migrations of the common brimstone. Uphill migration is potentially influenced by habitat limitations, such as a lack of the forest cover that is required during overwintering. Brimstones travel to higher elevations for greater forest cover and reduced exposure to higher temperatures during their activities. Downhill migration is influenced by the need for larval resources such as host plants during breeding seasons - the butterflies travel to lower elevations in search for regions containing these plants, with adults commonly returning to the areas where they had been bred due to their long lifespan.

== Enemies ==
=== Predators ===
Like most woodland Lepidoptera, &quot;G. rhamni&quot; is preyed upon by many species of birds and wasps. Both larvae and adult brimstones fall victim to predation and use means such as protective coloration and mimicry to avoid this fate.

=== Parasites ===
The common brimstone has two recorded species of parasites: the braconids &quot;Cotesia gonopterygis&quot; and &quot;Cotesia risilis&quot;. These two species of parasitoid wasps are completely specialised for &quot;G. rhamni&quot;, possibly due to the wide distribution of the butterfly and the host plants in its habitats. The broad presence of its host allows the wasps to be host-specific. The wasps are primarily associated with the presence of the food plant &quot;Frangula alnus&quot; due to its association with their host.

== Protective colouration and behaviour ==

Both the larval and adult common brimstone exhibit cryptic colouration, meaning they match the colour of their habitats. Larvae are so difficult to see due to this colouration that they can remain in the open undetected. When not eating, the caterpillars remain still in a position alongside the midrib of leaves, making them even more difficult to spot. Adult brimstones are leaf-mimics, as they share similarities in shape, colour, and pattern to leaves. This allows them to blend in with their surroundings during vulnerable times like diapause (hibernation). When picked up, the butterflies become rigid and hide their legs from view in order to decrease their chances of being recognised.

== Genetics of colour patterns ==
=== Pigmentation and structural coloration ===
Variation in coloration of Lepidoptera wings is caused by different structural and pigment components. These differences cause light to scatter in different ways, leading to the different colours. In the common brimstone, wing scales scatter light incoherently due to ovoid-shaped structures called beads that contain pigments. Due to these pigments, the beads absorb short wavelength light and scatter longer wavelengths outside of the pigment absorption spectrum, such as light in the complementary wavelength range.

Through chemical extraction and analysis, two possible pigments have been identified that may contribute to the common brimstone&#x27;s wing coloration. Xanthopterin is responsible for the sulphur yellow colour of the male wings since it absorbs in the violet range. Leucopterin was extracted from the white wings of females. The difference in wing pigmentation contributes to the distinct iridescence patterns of males and females. Iridescence occurs due to visualised changes in coloration from the scattering of ultraviolet light. A male-only pattern of coloration due to this iridescence is seen exclusively under ultraviolet light, since females absorb light on the ultraviolet spectra. The presence of exclusively leucopterin in female wings explains the lack of iridescence in female common brimstones, since leucopterin absorbs only in the ultraviolet range. Therefore, the wings do not reflect and consequently do not scatter any ultraviolet light like male wings do.

In males, iridescence is indicated in that the wing pattern appears to visually change depending on the position of the ultraviolet light shone onto the wing. At some angles, a male pattern is seen, while at other angles, a female lack of pattern is seen. This is referred to as the &quot;gynandromorphic effect&quot;. This demonstrates that the pattern appears to be optical, rather than pigmental, as the effect is only seen at certain angles and distances of light and changes with positions. If it were pigmental, these changes would not cause differences in iridescence.

The structural coloration of the male dorsal wings is affected by environmental factors. There is an increase in ultraviolet coloration coverage with increasing temperature, increasing precipitation, and decreasing latitude. This has been possibly attributed to several factors, such as the greater abundance and quality of resources in areas with these environmental conditions. Other possibilities include a better ability to assimilate resources as an indication of male mate quality. Because ultraviolet coloration is energetically expensive to develop, it could signal high male quality.

== Mating ==
After the common brimstone emerges from hibernation, it travels towards habitats that contain larval host plants and mates. The brimstone is primarily monandrous, as demonstrated by the presence of usually only a single spermatophore in females throughout the mating season. Pairs are formed after the butterflies have engaged in a dalliance flight for a period of time. When a pair settles to mate, they do not take flight during copulation and remain paired for a long time of up to forty-eight hours.

== Physiology ==
=== Vision ===
The common brimstone appears to have an innate preference for certain colours in nectar plants – red and blue inflorescences are common in heavily used nectar sources in some regions. &quot;G. rhamni&quot; also has a stronger reliance on visual indications such as colour compared with other butterfly species, which rely more on odour.

=== Olfaction ===
The common brimstone has an antennal response to the floral scent compounds of nectar plants, where neural activity in antennal olfactory receptors occurs in the presence of certain compounds. Research suggests that there are antennal olfactory receptors for phenylacetaldehyde and the terpene compounds oxoisophoroneoxide, oxoisophorone, and dihydrooxoisophorone, as these compounds elicited some of the strongest electrophysiological responses whether they were presented in natural or synthetic mixes of floral compounds. Additionally, these two compounds are present in the largest quantities in the nectar plants utilised by the brimstone, indicating that scent detection could be important for detecting food sources. This would contribute to more efficient foraging in adult butterflies, as odour could act as a cue for finding and distinguishing nectar plants, allowing more energy to be utilised for other activities such as reproduction.

=== Diapause ===
The adult common brimstone overwinters for seven months, remaining hidden and motionless throughout its hibernation. While both sexes have similar egg to adult development times, they differ in the times that they reach sexual maturity. The reproductive development of males begins just after pupal emergence, and continues during hibernation, which indicates that males may not be able to reproduce until after overwintering. For females, eggs remain undeveloped as the butterflies overwinter, and no reproductive development occurs until after emergence from hibernation.

The sexes also differ in times of emergence after overwintering. Emergence is correlated with temperature and hours of sunlight; a certain amount of both is necessary for the butterfly to emerge from hibernation and therefore influences when diapause ends. Males emerge earlier than females, as they are more willing to fly in lower temperatures than females. Since the common brimstone most closely follows monandrous mating patterns, males may emerge earlier to increase the number of mating chances and therefore reproductive success, as older males have had more time to develop and therefore have a greater advantage. In contrast, females emerge late due to the late seasonal development of host plants such as the alder buckthorn, since these plants are necessary for egg-laying. Female emergence is correlated with host plant development.

== Conservation ==
As of 2010, &quot;G. rhamni&quot; does not appear to have a threatened conservation status according to IUCN standards. However, the butterfly has experienced significant population and distribution reduction in areas such as the Netherlands, where its numbers have declined to the point that based on IUCN criterion, it has reached endangered species status. The causes of this population decline are not fully determined, but there are several possible factors. Since the common brimstone is univoltine, it may have difficulties adapting to changing environmental conditions compared to species that have multiple generations a year. For example, there has been a decrease in suitable overwintering environments for the butterflies, with open woodland decreasing in favour of more urban areas. Nitrogen pollution, declining nectar supplies, and rapid ecological changes have also been suggested as other hypothetical factors. Concerns have been raised about the possible future increase of this population decline, but the butterfly mostly does not appear to be a conservation concern due to its widespread and common geographic presence.

<text>Northsound 1 is an Independent Local Radio station based in Aberdeen, Scotland, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Aberdeenshire and North East Scotland.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 117,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==

Until Northsound Radio&#x27;s establishment, the only local radio output available to listeners in the North East of Scotland was a regional opt-out from the BBC at Beechgrove, which broadcast specialist music programmes for a couple of hours a week along with some opt-out regional news coverage. When a commercial radio franchise for Aberdeen, Peterhead and the surrounding areas was advertised by the then-regulator, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, a group of local businessmen applied under the consortium of &quot;North of Scotland Radio Ltd&quot; and won the franchise. 

After a change of name, &quot;Northsound Radio&quot; commenced broadcasting at 6am on 27 July 1981 from its original studios in an old schoolhouse on Kings Gate, near Anderson Drive in the city. Originally, the station was broadcast from 6am to 8pm each day on 1035 kHz (290 metres) and 96.9 FM (VHF).

For a two-year period from 1994, the station was the main sponsor of Aberdeen Football Club, with the logo appearing on the players&#x27; shirts.

On 9 January 1995, Northsound Radio was renamed Northsound 1 and Northsound 2 was established as a classic hits station using the station&#x27;s AM frequency. Both stations have since started broadcasting on DAB radio and online.

=== Free concerts ===
From 1997 until 2007, Northsound held free music concerts in Aberdeen almost bi-annually. Northsound delivered its first major outdoor event when the Tall Ships arrived in Aberdeen, which called &quot;Free at the Quay&quot;. Following its success, &quot;Free 2000&quot; was staged at the Queen’s Links at Aberdeen Beach followed by &quot;Free at the Dee&quot; at Duthie Park.

Due to the numbers attending, Northsound decided to move the event to Hazlehead Park and the event was renamed to simply &quot;Free 2007&quot;. More than 30,000 people attended &quot;Free 2007&quot; which saw Beverley Knight, McFly, Shayne Ward, Booty Luv, MacDonald Brothers, Ali Love, Unklejam and others perform free.

Northsound has also been sponsors and organisers of Aberdeen&#x27;s free Hogmanay street party when they were staged in the city, where performers such as Sandi Thom, Travis and Amy MacDonald have played to large crowds.
==Programming==
The entirety of the station&#x27;s programming, barring one weekend show is networked; produced and broadcast from Clyde 1 in Clydebank, Forth 1 in Edinburgh and Hits Radio in London &amp; Manchester.

The last remaining local programming strand which consisted of just weekday breakfast was axed in December 2024.

===News and sport===
Northsound 1 broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am to 7pm on weekdays and from 7am to 1pm at weekends. Headlines are broadcast on the half hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside sport, traffic and business bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with networked Scottish bulletins at weekends, produced from Radio Clyde&#x27;s newsroom in Clydebank.

Extended sports coverage airs under the &quot;Superscoreboard&quot; banner on Saturday afternoons.

==Notable DJs ==

*Nicky Campbell - now a BBC journalist and television presenter.
*Alan Fisher - worked at the station as a reporter/newsreader and is now a senior correspondent with the global news channel, Al Jazeera English based in the United States.
*Robin Galloway - later became a continuity announcer and newsreader for Grampian Television. He now currently presents the breakfast show on Pure Radio in Glasgow &amp; Tayside.

<text>Kurt Robin McKinney is an American actor and martial artist. McKinney played Jason Stillwell in the 1986 martial arts film &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender&quot;.

== Early years ==
A native of Louisville, Kentucky, McKinney graduated from Ninth and O Christian School in 1980 and attended the University of Louisville for one year. After that, he gained acting experience in local commercials and films while supporting himself by selling cars for Neil Huffman Dodge. Encouraged by people&#x27;s comments, he left Louisville to go to Hollywood.
He began martial arts at age 12 with Taekwondo, but later trained in Kickboxing.

==Acting==
===&quot;No Retreat, No Surrender&quot;===
McKinney&#x27;s film debut came playing Jason Stillwell in 1985 martial arts film &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender&quot;, (Kurt McKinney was 22 years old when he did that movie) which also starred Jean-Claude Van Damme, J.W. Fails and Tai Chung Kim. The movie grossed $5 million at the US box office (and spawned two sequels). Although this success was moderate compared to similar movies of the time, such as the &quot;Rocky&quot; series, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; series, or even &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;, it remains a cult classic film to many people around the world. 1987&#x27;s &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender 2&quot; was originally intended to be a direct sequel to this film, but safety concerns over filming in Cambodian jungles persuaded Van Damme to back out of the project, and he convinced McKinney to do the same.

===TV series===
Early in his career, McKinney had guest starring roles on series such as &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; (1985–86), &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; (1987) and &quot;ALF&quot; (1986). He accepted his first contract role in a TV series. He appeared as the first Ned Ashton on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

===Films and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;===
After departing &quot;General Hospital&quot;, McKinney starred in the 1993 TV film &quot;Sworn to Vengeance&quot; and the unrelated 1996 feature &quot;Sworn to Justice&quot;.

His second contract role in a TV series was also his longest, appearing as Matt Reardon in the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1994 to 2000 and 2005 to 2009, when the series was canceled.

During his first stint in &quot;Guiding Light&quot; he filmed a minor role in 1999 film &quot;Pop&quot;. McKinney left the soap in 2000 and continued to appear in minor roles in relatively obscure independent films, including 2000&#x27;s &quot;Cupid &amp; Kate&quot;, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Supertalk&quot;, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Bending All the Rules&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Savage Faith&quot;.

Shortly before his return to &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 2005, reprising the role of Matt Reardon, McKinney commented in an interview that he had been busy doing several independent films in recent years saying &quot;you&#x27;ll probably never see which is unfortunately where so many of those end up.&quot;

==Personal life==
McKinney is married to Maronda McKinney, the former Maronda Buchta, whom he met when both were 18. They have a son, Cole Madsen, and a daughter, Madison Taylor.

<text>The Seattle Police Department (SPD) is the principal law enforcement agency of the city of Seattle, Washington, United States. It is responsible for the whole city except for the campus of the University of Washington (which is under the university&#x27;s police department).

Law enforcement in Seattle began with the election of John T. Jordan as town marshal in 1869. The SPD was officially organized on June 2, 1869, predating the incorporation of Seattle by the territorial legislature in December. Today it has a number of specialty units including SWAT, bike patrol, harbor patrol, motorcycles, and a variety of detective units.

The SPD has been under federal oversight since 2012, when policy and procedural reforms were instituted after a United States Department of Justice investigation found that SPD officers routinely used excessive force. 

Patrolmen are represented by the Seattle Police Officers&#x27; Guild in labor negotiations.

== Command structure ==

* Chief of Police: Shon Barnes
* Deputy Chief: Eric Barden 
* Chief Operating Officer: Brian Maxey
* Assistant Chief of Operations: Todd Kibbee
* Assistant Chief of Investigations: Tom Mahaffey
* Assistant Chief of Professional Standard: Lesley Cordner
* Assistant Chief of Metropolitan: Interim Daniel Nelson
* Assistant Chief of Special Operations: Tyrone Davis
* General Counsel and Executive Director of Analytics and Research: Attorney Rebecca Boatright
* Executive Director of Human Resources: Mike Fields
* Executive Director of Administration: CAO Valarie Anderson
* Executive Director of Budget and Finance: Angela Socci
* Executive Director of Strategic Initiatives: Heather Marx
* Chief of Staff: Jamie Tompkins, formerly of Q13 Fox News

== Rank structure and insignia ==

Sergeant Major Arnold &quot;Arny&quot; McGinnis (retired in 2012) is the only known SPD member to hold the rank.*

=== Promotions ===
After three years in patrol, officers can become candidates to transfer to a wide variety of specialty units and are also eligible to attend a weeklong detective school. After five years as a police officer, they can take a promotional examination. Every other year, civil service tests are administered for promotions. Tests are given for the rank of sergeant, lieutenant, and captain. Assistant and deputy chiefs are appointed by the chief from the management ranks. Officers may be promoted to sergeant after five years of experience with the department and passing the sergeant&#x27;s exam. Lieutenants must have at least three years&#x27; experience as sergeants, and captains must have at least three years&#x27; experience as lieutenants. A bachelor&#x27;s degree may substitute for one year of experience but can only be used for one promotional exam.

== History ==


The Seattle police force was established in 1869 with the election of John T. Jordan as the first town marshal. In 1883, the town marshal position was disestablished and replaced by an appointed position: the chief of police. By 1896, there were 43 police officers and 60,000 residents.

Officer David Sires was the first officer to be killed in the line of duty in 1881. The man accused of killing Sires, along with two other men accused of murder, were lynched by a mob of Seattleites in January, 1882. This event, along with the Anti-Chinese Race Riots of 1886 were associated with significant investment by the city into the police department. 

The State of Washington prohibited alcohol in 1916. Police Lieutenant Roy Olmstead began a bootlegging operation while employed by the police department. In March 1920, he was arrested by Federal prohibition agents and was fired from his job with the department. After being fired, he continued to run a very profitable rumrunning business. Relying on bribery of police officers, Olmstead was able to avoid most conflict until his arrest in 1924. He was convicted in 1926 with twenty others in one of the first cases that used telephone wiretaps. Olmstead&#x27;s case made it to the supreme court, where his conviction was upheld. He was released in 1931 and pardoned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935.

In June 1924, Bertha Landes served as acting mayor while Edwin J. Brown was out of the city to attend the Democratic National Convention. In a newspaper story, Police Chief William Severyns said that the department had at least a hundred corrupt officers. Mayor Landes ordered the chief to fire one hundred officers. When he refused, Landes fired him. Mayor Brown rushed back to the city to reverse Mayor Landes&#x27; actions. Following Landes term as acting mayor, she became the first elected female mayor of Seattle in 1926. Mayor Landes was a strict enforcer of anti-vice law and was critical of the SPD. Quickly thereafter, Chief Severyns described to the &quot;Seattle Union Record&quot; several cases of police brutality. One report included questioning suspects in a rowboat in Lake Washington with a heavy weight tied around their necks. This was one of the first official accounts of police corruption and brutality in the city.

In July 1935, the city council held hearings on the many gambling and prostitution dens in the city. The police chief claimed he had no knowledge of such activities in the city. Councilman Fred Hamley walked with the chief onto Fourth Avenue to an establishment that featured a roulette wheel and handed him an ax. The chief remained in office.

In 1943, after many cases of soldiers returning to bases from Seattle with sexually transmitted diseases, the federal government threatened to take over policing in the city and enforce laws on prostitution and sex-work. After this, Chief Kimsey began a crackdown on prostitution. 

In the autumn of 1947, police Chief George Eastman reassigned the police captain in charge of suppressing illegal alcohol sales after complaints such establishments were running openly. The chief took no steps to otherwise discipline the man.

In November 1969, police Chief Frank Ramon retired after accusations that he had tried to stifle an investigation into gambling and government corruption.

On June 21, 1974, a Seattle Police helicopter on its way to a shooting collided with a Cessna plane near Boeing Field. Both officers on board and both civilians in the plane were killed.

In 1987, the Seattle Police Department created the modern mountain bike patrol units, paving the way for cities across North America to follow.

In 2011, the United States Justice Department found that the department had engaged in a pattern of constitutional violations in its use of force.

In 2012, the rank of &quot;Sergeant Major&quot; was created and bestowed upon then-Sergeant Arnold &quot;Arny&quot; McGinnis. Sergeant Major McGinnis started working at the Seattle Police Department in 1962, holding the rank of police officer. He retired in July 2012 at the age of 75, reaching fifty years of service to the city of Seattle. He is the only member of the SPD known to hold the rank.

On May 19, 2014, Kathleen O&#x27;Toole was nominated to serve as Chief of the Seattle Police Department and was officially appointed on June 23, 2014. In 2015, O&#x27;Toole and others in the department developed and implemented a data-oriented policing strategy called &quot;Agile Policing Strategy&quot;, influenced by agile manufacturing. The approach was developed to increase the responsiveness or agility of the department to address crime and disorder problems through the real-time surfacing, visualization, analysis, and sharing of data across all necessary operational units of the police department. Organizationally, this was accomplished through the SPD&#x27;s Real Time Crime Center, established in July 2015 using a combination of asset forfeiture funds and a federal government grant, which houses the technology, analytical support and command structure.

===2020 George Floyd protests ===
On Sunday May 31, 2020, the department blockaded the streets around the East Precinct which was located at the intersection of 12th Ave E and E Pine. They did this before a protest march approached the precinct. The march moved on after a short while. On Monday June 1 a much larger group of thousands marched from Westlake Plaza to the intersection of 11th Ave E and E Pine where the street was blockaded. This day the march did not move on. After several hours the police ordered the group to disperse. When they did not they tear gassed the protestors. A similar gathering formed the next night. This was also ordered to disperse and tear gassed. 
On June 3, Mayor Jenny Durkan lifted the curfew that had been in effect since May 30.
On June 5, Mayor Durkan banned the use of tear gas for 30 days without the approval of the Police Chief.
On Saturday June 6, the police again used pepper spray and non-tear gas explosives to try to disperse demonstrators. Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant said “The police had come prepared to inflict violence without provocation.” By this time protestors had coalesced around demands of defunding of the police department by at least 50 percent, an expansion of investments in black and brown communities, and releasing all protestors. 
Nightly protests continued until June 7 when the crowd was again dispersed by flash bangs and tear gas, which the police said was in response to protesters throwing projectiles at officers. On Monday June 8 the police boarded up the precinct and withdrew from the building. Later that night residents declared &quot;Free Capitol Hill&quot;.

On June 17, 2020, King County Labor Council delegates voted to expel the Seattle Police Officers Guild from the organization, following a demand pushed by many protesters.

On August 11, 2020, it was announced that Police Chief Carmen Best would retire, effective September 2, 2020. Deputy Chief Adrian Z. Diaz succeeded Best in an interim capacity and was appointed to the permanent position on September 20, 2022.

In January 2024, the City settled a lawsuit brought by 50 protesters who were injured during the protests for $10 million.

On May 30, 2024, former King County Sheriff Sue Rahr was appointed Interim Police Chief by Mayor Bruce Harrell. Rahr was appointed to replace Chief Adrian Diaz, who was removed and reassigned to other special assignments within the SPD. Diaz was removed after he was named by at least six SPD officers in lawsuits against the department alleging discrimination. Rahr will only spend a few months in the role and is not interested in holding the position regularly. Instead, she will collaborate with former SPD Chief Kathleen O’Toole to compile a list of qualified semi-finalist candidates for public review. Diaz was fired in December of 2024.

== Controversies and misconduct ==
=== Before 2000 ===
In June 1901, Police Chief William L. Meredith was forced to resign by a Seattle City Council investigation that found he had taken bribes and allowed illegal gambling operations to flourish. Meredith then ambushed one of his accusers in a local drugstore with a shotgun and pistol. It went badly for him and he was killed by John Considine, his intended victim.

In 1911, Police Chief Charles W. Wappenstein was ousted by a reform-minded mayor. He was convicted on state charges related to bribery, prostitution, and other vices. In December 1913, Governor Ernest Lister granted him a pardon. He died in 1931.

In January 1967, the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; ran a series of stories revealing a long-standing and widespread culture of corruption in the police department. Gambling dens, illegal bars and gay clubs were forced to pay protection to the local patrolman who kept half and passed to his sergeant who in turn kept half and passed the remainder along.

Former homicide detective, Earl “Sonny” Davis, was accused of stealing at least $11,400 on Oct. 1, 1996, from the belongings of an elderly man, Bodegard Mitchell, who was fatally shot by police during a standoff at a South Seattle apartment. Davis&#x27; ex-partner, Cloyd Steiger, testified he saw Davis pocket a bundle of cash - which Steiger initially believed to be about $100 - while the two were searching the apartment for evidence. Steiger further testified Davis asked him if he had a problem with taking money, referred to it as a &quot;squad thing&quot;.

In 1999, Seattle hosted the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference. The Seattle Police Department was criticized for failing to properly prepare for protest activity involving over 100,000 protesters that disrupted the conference. While the majority of protestors were not violent, some assaulted delegates and police, and destroyed property. The protest soon devolved into a riot. In response, SPD used chemical agents and less-lethal weapons in an attempt to restore order. News footage of this response and of the rioting was broadcast worldwide. No protesters or police officers were injured seriously enough during the riot to require hospitalization. Chief Norm Stamper resigned amid the scrutiny of police response to the event.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, riots broke out downtown during the Mardi Gras celebrations. The riots resulted in one death, more than 70 hospitalizations, and 21 arrests.

In July of the same year, Officer Jess Pitts stopped a group of 14 Asian-American students and instructors for jaywalking in the International District. The students alleged that Pitts lined them up against a wall and detained them for around 45 minutes while repeatedly asking if they spoke English. An instructor Andrew Cho claimed that another officer on the scene Officer Larry Brotherton said to him &quot;I&#x27;ve been to your country before, when I was in the Army&quot;, incorrectly assuming Cho was Vietnamese. Only one student was issued a citation, which was later dismissed. The student&#x27;s attorney noted that because she said to Pitts &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t have stopped us if we had blond hair&quot; and was the only one issued a citation, this showed that the ticket was issued in response to her antagonizing the officer, rather than for jaywalking. The Office of Police Accountability (OPA) later sustained a single allegation of unprofessionalism against Pitts.

The Seattle Police Officers&#x27; Guild membership later overwhelmingly passed a vote of no confidence in Chief Gil Kerlikowske, citing a double standard where Officer Pitts, a beat officer, was publicly criticized for the jaywalking incident but upper-level personnel were not held responsible for failures in handling the Mardi Gras riots.

Former detective Dale Nixdorf resigned after an OPA investigation sustained a complaint claiming that he sexually harassed and assaulted a woman who sought help after a domestic violence incident in 2003. According to a lawsuit filed in 2006, Nixdorf was assigned to drive her home and install one of the department&#x27;s temporary alarm systems after the incident. Over the next couple weeks, Nixdorf allegedly called and visited her home repeatedly, claiming to be checking on the security system while making sexually aggressive comments and asking for sex each time. The lawsuit also claimed that Nixdorf grabbed her buttocks and forced her to fondle him over his jeans.

On May 22, 2009, SPD officer and hostage negotiator Eugene Schubeck shot Nathaniel Caylor in the face. Police were responding to a report that Caylor was suicidal and had locked himself in his apartment with his son. Caylor was speaking to Schubeck from his patio, and was shot when he attempted to re-enter his apartment. In June 2015, the resulting use-of-force lawsuit was settled for $1.975 million, the largest such settlement in the city&#x27;s history.

=== 2010s ===
In August 2010, SPD officer Ian Birk shot and killed Native American woodcarver John T. Williams. Subsequent grand jury findings on the level of threat posed by Williams were inconclusive but an internal review of the shooting by the SPD&#x27;s Firearms Review Commission found the shooting &quot;unjustified&quot; and cited Birk&#x27;s tactical mishandling of the confrontation as being responsible for Williams&#x27; death. Birk resigned from the department, though prosecutor Dan Satterberg declined to file charges, prompting a protest by Williams&#x27; family and supporters.

In 2010, detectives from SPD&#x27;s Gang Unit ordered two Latino men suspected of committing a crime to lie on the ground, where they were kicked and verbally assaulted; the incident was captured on a bystander&#x27;s cellphone video. The police let the men go soon afterwards; the video prompted protests over racial tensions and a police department internal investigation. Several officers were suspended without pay and/or demoted, but not criminally charged. A civil lawsuit by one of the two men has been filed. It was settled later in 2012 for $100,000.

In December 2011, the SPD was subject to a U.S. Department of Justice investigation that found officers had violated the 14th Amendment and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The DOJ found that SPD officers engaged in a pattern of excessive use of force that violated the Constitution as well as Federal law. Furthermore, the regular invocation of the &quot;Garrity v. New Jersey&quot; protection was found to have reduced the department&#x27;s ability to supervise the use of force and hinder investigations. A spokesman for the SPD indicated they will fully comply with the DOJ inquiry to avoid a federal lawsuit. In late July 2012, the city and Department of Justice reached a settlement that included improved oversight, training and reporting.

On 6 October 2012, Officer Eric Faust beat a man he was attempting to detain. In September 2013, as a result of an internal investigation, the department suspended Faust for eight days without pay.

On 13 July 2013, the department fired Lieutenant Donnie Lowe due to misconduct characterized as domestic violence and dishonesty.

On 30 July 2013, Officer John Marion, threatened a reporter who was observing a number of policemen making an arrest. An internal investigation of Marion&#x27;s behavior confirmed his actions. He was given a single day of unpaid suspension.

In August 2013, the city agreed to pay two brothers $38,500 for a case of abuse. The two men claimed they were targeted by Officer Michael Waters because he was upset at how they had treated him at a local bar. According to the claim, Waters and his partner used the pretext of looking for two bank robbers to humiliate and assault the two men. Although the city agreed to settle the matter, neither officer was punished and they continue on the force.

In January 2014, Detective David Blackmer plead guilty to stalking his mistress after she threatened to reveal their relationship to his wife. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail. An internal police investigation was then launched to determine whether he should be fired.

In July 2014, Officer Cynthia Whitlatch arrested William Wingate, a black pedestrian who had a golf club that he was using as a cane. She falsely claimed that Wingate had swung his cane at her and he was charged with obstruction and harassment and spent a night in jail. When video showed he had done nothing to provoke the officer, the police department apologized in January 2015. Whitlatch was later fired by Chief O&#x27;Toole.

In March 2015, Officer Peter Leutz was fired after an investigation found that he sent three women he met on duty over 100 text messages in pursuit of romantic relationships. In a written letter to Leutz, Police Chief Kathleen O&#x27;Toole wrote that he engaged in &quot;serious and repeated abuse of authority, and an unsettling pattern of behavior, some of it directed at women who [he] knew from the outset, or learned early on, may have been especially vulnerable given turmoil in their personal lives.&quot;

In November 2016, Officer Adley Shepherd was fired after he punched a drunk, handcuffed woman who kicked him while he was putting her into the back of his police car. An arbitrator on the Disciplinary Review Board later attempted to reduce the firing to a 15-day suspension, but was overruled by a King County Superior Court judge. The case was again appealed to the Court of Appeals which upheld the previous ruling, writing that the arbitrator&#x27;s decision to overturn Shepherd&#x27;s firing &quot;sends a message to officers that a violation of a clear and specific policy is not that serious if the officer is dealing with a difficult subject, losing patience, or passionate in believing that he or she did nothing wrong — however mistaken that belief may be.&quot;

In March 2017, a duffel bag in the South Precinct was found containing a handgun reported stolen in 1990.

In May 2018, Officer Matthew Kerby drove to a West Seattle house in search of a man who allegedly drove away from a minor collision. When he found that the man was not home, he falsely told a woman at the home that the man had been involved in a hit-and-run in which a woman involved might not survive. This led to a chain of events which culminated in the man&#x27;s suicide in June of that year. Kerby was later suspended for six days without pay.

In July 2018, officers Kenneth Martin and Tabitha Sexton were fired after an October 2017 incident in which they shot 27 rounds into a fleeing car in Eastlake.

In October 2018, Sergeant Frank Poblocki was demoted to officer after he sat for 40 minutes outside the workplace of a man who cursed him and called him names. Witnesses say he referred to this behavior as community policing.

In February 2019, the city agreed to pay Alonzo Price-Holt $100,001, as well as $58,989 in attorney fees, to settle a federal lawsuit that alleged excessive use of force by Officer Zsolt Dornay. Footage from the holding cell shows Officer Dornay tackling Price-Holt, who had his hands handcuffed behind his back. Dornay was also given 30 days of unpaid leave as a result of the incident. Dornay had previously been convicted of drunk driving.

=== 2020s ===

In January 2020, Officer Duane Goodman was fired for his Instagram posts, which a report by the Office of Police Accountability described as using &quot;extreme profane language&quot; and posts that ranted against &quot;illegal immigration&quot; and &quot;appeared to endorse violence&quot; against Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The department contacted the U.S. Secret Service, who interviewed Goodman, after he captioned an image of a package bomb with the message, &quot;I don&#x27;t condone sending package bombs but god it would be nice for Killary and Anti-cop Obama to finally STFU! Maybe Obama will stop lying and claiming the good economy is from him.&quot;

In February 2020, Officer Todd Novisedlak was fired after an investigation by the OPA which cited his physically abusing his ex-girlfriend, his marijuana use, and his repeatedly making discriminatory and derogatory remarks against others based on race, sexual orientation, and gender. This follows a 2015 court case, settled by the city, in which a man was jailed for a week after a kidnapping victim &quot;positively identified&quot; a license photograph, shown to her by Novisedlak, of a man with the same name as one of the suspects.

In the same month, it was reported that Lieutenant Sina Ebinger, who led the city&#x27;s Navigation Team, used the city contractor which clears encampments to remove personal garbage from her home. An investigation by the Office of Police Accountability found that in addition to using city resources for personal benefit, she told investigators several different versions of her story and deleted her entire text and browsing history and phone log. After the OPA findings were released, she retired from the department in lieu of termination.

In May 2020, during the George Floyd protests in Washington state, while Seattle police were attempting to detain looters, a white suspect was restrained with an officer&#x27;s knee on his neck for 13 seconds while bystanders urged the officer to stop. This continued until a second officer intervened to push the first officer&#x27;s knee to the suspect&#x27;s back. This was documented on video. George Floyd himself had died after being restrained with a knee on his neck during an arrest. According to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, further video footage showed that the same Seattle officer had just used his knee on the neck of another white looting suspect.

In June 2020, a Federal Judge in Seattle ordered local police to stop using tear gas, pepper spray, stun grenade, &quot;rubber bullets&quot;, and other force against non-violent protestors, finding that the Seattle Police had used excessive force against demonstrators, violating their right to free speech.

An investigation by the South Seattle Emerald in July 2020 found that at least eight SPD officers violated department policy and possibly election law by registering to vote at their precinct address, as opposed to their residential address. After the OPA investigation concluded, five officers (including the Seattle Police Officers Guild president Mike Solan) received written reprimands or 1 day suspensions.

Police union president Mike Solan faced calls for him to resign after falsely claiming that the January 6 United States Capitol attack was at least partially the fault of Black Lives Matter and other left-wing activists in early January 2021. At least two SPD officers who attended the riot or the preceding rally were placed on administrative leave. SPD officers Alexander Everett and Caitlin Rochelle, a married couple, were later fired after an OPA investigation found that they trespassed onto Capitol grounds during the attack.

In September 2021, the city of Seattle settled a lawsuit for $250,000 after officers entered the home of a 74-year-old man during a 2019 welfare check, held him at gunpoint, and forcefully arrested him. A previous OPA investigation into the incident had concluded that allegations of excessive force were unfounded and consistent with department policy.

An OPA investigation released in January 2022 revealed that during the George Floyd protests in June 2020, SPD officers faked radio chatter about armed Proud Boys heading toward the area that would later be known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). According to OPA Director Myerberg, this &quot;improperly added fuel to the fire and could have had dire results.&quot; The investigation did not sustain allegations against any officers identified in the radio transmissions but instead against two supervisors who had already left the department. This revelation followed several other instances of misinformation from the department during the 2020 protests, such as claims of extortion in the CHOP area and a SPD tweet claiming pictured candles were improvised explosives thrown by protesters at police.

In April 2022, the Seattle Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released a report that found that the OPA routinely dismissed complaints against officers who violated the mask mandate by calling it a systemic issue to be addressed by the department rather than a matter for individual discipline. None of the 98 mask-related allegations reviewed by the OIG were sustained by OPA, even as officers repeatedly violated the mandate. The report also noted that the department was previously fined $5,400 in February 2021 by the Washington Department of Labor and Industries for mask violations but was forced to drop the case after officers used tactics to prolong OPA investigations into the allegations.

In October 2021, Twitter user @WhiteRoseAFA posted a thread that linked an anonymous Twitter account to Officer Andrei Constantin and listed screenshots of several offensive tweets from the account including posts that celebrated violence against protesters, taunted a grieving mother, and stated George Floyd &quot;got justice&quot;. Constantin was fired from the department in September 2022 after the ensuing OPA investigation concluded. In the disciplinary action report explaining the termination, Police Chief Adrian Diaz also pointed to Constantin&#x27;s history of disciplinary issues, including two suspensions, as contributing to the determination.

An OPA investigation issued in August 2022 alleged that an SPD commander brought window blinds, a sleeping cot, and a mattress to the office and would regularly sleep in his office while on duty. He resigned from the department before he could be disciplined and declined to be interviewed for the investigation.

In January 2023, Officer Kevin Dave, responding to an overdose call, struck and killed 23-year-old student Jaahnavi Kandula as she was crossing Dexter Avenue in a marked crosswalk on Thomas Street. The department did not confirm that Kandula had died until 18 hours after the collision and declined to provide information about the involved officer or the speed at which he was driving. A department spokeswoman stated that the officer would not be reporting to his next shift but would instead take a &quot;release day&quot; following a &quot;traumatic or upsetting&quot; event. Documents obtained by local outlet Publicola later revealed that the officer was driving 74 MPH in an area with a 25 MPH speed limit immediately before the collision. In September 2023, SPD released body camera footage showing Seattle Police Officer Daniel Auderer discussing Kandula&#x27;s death one day after she died; he stated: &quot;she&#x27;s dead&quot;, laughs, then says: &quot;it&#x27;s a regular person ... just write a check, $11,000, she was 26 anyway, she had limited value.&quot; Auderer, who is also the Vice President of the Seattle Police Officers&#x27; Guild, made the comments while talking on a call to Mike Solan, President of the Seattle Police Officers&#x27; Guild. Later in September 2023, the department had Auderer &quot;administratively reassigned to a non-operational position&quot;. He was later fired, according to an internal email sent to the department. 

In July 2023, a lawsuit related to the 2020 George Floyd protests surfaced video captured on police body-worn camera in SPD&#x27;s East Precinct showing a &quot;Trump 2020&quot; flag prominently displayed in a precinct break room, along with a mock tombstone marking the death of Damarius Butts, a 19-year-old Black man killed by the department in 2017. The department speculated that the tombstone was taken from protests commemorating victims of police brutality and placed on a shelf for storage.

In September 2023, &quot;The Stranger&quot; published an audio recording of Officer Burton Hill using racist slurs and sexist language at his elderly Chinese-American neighbor. He was later placed on administrative leave after the police chief listened to the audio recording.

In November 2023, a lawsuit filed against the city of Seattle alleged that Seattle police officers broke down a woman&#x27;s door and entered with guns drawn while responding to a crisis call for a different building.

In May 2024, a video uploaded to Instagram showed two officers repeatedly beating a man on his stomach with batons, with force described by the person who took the video as excessive.

== Sidearm ==
A majority of SPD officers carry semi-automatic pistols of various make and caliber. The SPD authorizes numerous pistols for carry, including ones made by Glock, Smith &amp; Wesson, Springfield Armory, Inc., Heckler &amp; Koch, Walther, Beretta, SIG-Sauer and Ruger. The most common sidearm chosen by officers of the SPD are various Glock models, such as the Glock Model 17 in 9mm, Model 22 in .40 S&amp;W, and the Model 21 in .45 ACP. The compact Glock Model 19 in 9 mm and Model 23 in .40 are also used by officers.

However, while the majority of officers carry semi automatics, double-action revolvers produced by Smith &amp; Wesson, Ruger, Colt and Taurus are also authorized for carry, in .38 Special, .357 Magnum and .45 ACP.

AR-15s and shotguns are also issued to patrol officers after additional required qualification(s). Specialty units including SWAT utilize select fire suppressed rifles (typically an AR variant), HK MP5 SMG&#x27;s, shotguns and sniper weapon systems.

== Bike Unit ==

The SPD&#x27;s Bike Unit was the first mountain bike unit in the United States.

In 2005, the department started testing the use of BlackBerry PDAs with bike patrol officers. These PDAs allowed officers on the streets access to police records when the use of regular mobile data computer is not available.

== Seattle Metropolitan Police Museum ==
The Seattle Metropolitan Police Museum was a museum in the city&#x27;s Pioneer Square neighborhood. Founded in 1997, it was dedicated to the history of the Seattle Police Department and of law enforcement in the Seattle metropolitan area. It claimed to be the largest police museum in the western United States until its closure in 2017 due to safety concerns because of the ongoing waterfront tunnel project.

==List of chiefs==
The 1869 City Charter created the position of marshal to act as the primary law enforcement officer of the city. The position was an elected one, with terms lasting a single year.

In 1883, an amendment to the city charter disestablished the position of marshal and established the new elected position of chief of police. The Freeholders City Charter of 1890 established a five-member Board of Police Commissioners that oversaw the police department&#x27;s operations. Under this charter position of chief of police no longer was elected, but rather was appointed by the commission. The commission was chaired by the mayor. The Freeholders City Charter of 1896 disestablished the Board of Police Commissioners and granted the Mayor authority to appoint and to remove chiefs of police. An amendment in 1936 stipulated that chiefs were to be appointed for five year terms. However, the superseding new Freeholders City Charter adopted on March 12, 1946 did not specify a term length.

<doc id="956028" wikidata="Q7975267" url="?curid=956028" title="Wave 105">
<text>Wave 105 was an Independent Regional Radio station based in Fareham, England, owned and operated by Bauer. It broadcast to South Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, West Sussex, Wiltshire, and Dorset.

As of December 2023, the station had a weekly audience of 405,000 listeners according to RAJAR and over 5 million listening hours, making it one of the most listened to regional radio stations in the UK and the most popular station in its transmission area.

In February 2024, Bauer Media announced that the station would be rebranded as [[Greatest Hits Radio]] on 28 March 2024, and be merged with Greatest Hits Radio South. It will retain opt outs for breakfast in the interim.

Most former Wave 105 presenters including Steve Power, Mark Collins, Tony Shepherd, Andy Jackson, Gary Parker, Tim Allen, Selina Ross and Kate Weston can be heard on Nation Radio South.

==History==
Wave 105 began broadcasting on 14 June 1998. It was based in a studio complex at Segensworth East, on the outskirts of Fareham, and broadcast on 105.2 MHz (South Hampshire, Isle of Wight, West Sussex, East Dorset and Wiltshire), as well as on DAB digital radio via the South Hampshire and Dorset multiplexes, and online.

News was provided by Wave 105&#x27;s in-house local newsroom in conjunction with Sky News Radio. In recent years, the station shared a music playlist and many features with Cornwall-based sister station Pirate FM.

On 19 September 2022, the Bournemouth and Poole relay of Wave 105 on 105.8 FM was replaced by a relay of Greatest Hits Radio Dorset, following approval from the broadcast regular OFCOM.

===Greatest Hits Radio rebrand===
On 27 February 2024, station owners Bauer announced Wave 105 would be rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio South Coast from March 2024, as part of a wider relaunch involving 17 local radio stations in England and Wales.

Most of the station&#x27;s local programming was replaced with networked output - including weekday shows with Ken Bruce and Simon Mayo - although Greatest Hits Radio retains regional breakfast and afternoon shows, hosted by Rick Jackson and Mark Collins, alongside hourly local news bulletins throughout the day - and travel updates, provided on breakfast and drivetime shows by INRIX. 

However, the regional shows only lasted six months and by Christmas 2024, both Rick Jackson and Mark Collins were moving on with Bauer preferring a GHR national feed across the frequencies. Jackson moved to BBC Radio Solent and Collins joined the majority of his ex-Wave 105 colleagues at Nation Radio South, which had itself re-branded to an all regional format with local presenters and travel information.

These shows are broadcast on the current DAB multiplexes and to match this area on FM, will also be broadcast on 105.2FM, 105.8FM (Poole), 97.2FM (Dorchester &amp; Weymouth), 96FM (Bridport), 97.4FM (Shaftesbury) and 96.6FM (Blandford Forum). 

Under the current licence conditions, revised in August 2022, the station is required to produce a minimum of three hours of local programming on weekdays and can share all programming with sister stations in the South of England.

The rebrand led to a number of redundancies and all presenters&#x27; freelance contracts were placed under review.

Wave 105 ended regular broadcasting at 10pm on Thursday 28 March 2024, following a short tribute programme produced by the station&#x27;s head of production Tim Allen. The final song played under the brand was &quot;Say Hello Wave Goodbye&quot; by Soft Cell.

The station was formally relaunched as Greatest Hits Radio at 10am the following morning.
== Ownership ==
Owned by media company Bauer, Wave 105 was initially created by a group of private investors under the name of The Radio Partnership. The station was then sold to Kelvin MacKenzie&#x27;s Wireless Group. The Wireless Group eventually sold Wave 105 to Scottish Radio Holdings (SRH) who were acquired by EMAP in 2005.

== Awards ==
In 2023, Wave 105 was nominated for &quot;Station of the Year&quot; at the ARIAS, the leading radio industry awards in the UK. In 2004, Wave 105 won the NTL Commercial Radio Station of the Year award in the category for stations with a potential audience of over one million listeners.

<text>Clyde 1 Ayrshire, formerly West FM, is an Independent Local Radio station based in Glasgow, Scotland, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Ayrshire and South West Scotland.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 105,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==Programming==
Regional programming is produced and broadcast from Clyde 1 at its studios in Clydebank, weekdays 6-10am for &quot;Bowie At Breakfast&quot;. At all other times, the station airs networked programming from Forth 1 in Edinburgh, Tay FM in Dundee as well as Hits Radio in London and Manchester.

On Monday 10 July 2017, West FM ceased broadcasting from Ayr and moved its studio output to Clyde 1&#x27;s Clydebank studios. The station retained its local breakfast, albeit presented from Clydebank, with news, sales and charity staff based in Prestwick.

In August 2024, it was announced that after 27 years of the West FM name, the station would be rebranded to &#x27;Clyde 1 Ayrshire&#x27; from 16 September 2024 and share all output with Clyde 1 whilst retaining local news, weather and travel bulletins.

===News and Sport===
Clyde 1 Ayrshire broadcasts local news bulletins hourly. Headlines are broadcast on the half hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside sport and traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked Scottish bulletins at weekends, produced from Radio Clyde&#x27;s newsroom in Clydebank.

<text>Live at Red Rocks 8.15.95 is an album by the Dave Matthews Band, released on October 28, 1997. It was recorded live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado on August 15, 1995. The album is known on the Internet by the abbreviation L@RR. The band&#x27;s performance was during the third consecutive year at which they had played at the venue (although in 1993 only as a warm up for The Tragically Hip / The Samples.). Guitarist Tim Reynolds guested with the band during the entire show. Most of the songs featured were from the band&#x27;s most recent album &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;. &quot;Ants Marching,&quot; &quot;Satellite,&quot; &quot;Seek Up,&quot; &quot;Recently,&quot; and &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; originally appeared on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Remember Two Things&quot;, while &quot;Proudest Monkey,&quot; &quot;Two Step,&quot; &quot;Lie in Our Graves,&quot; and &quot;Drive In Drive Out&quot; would not appear as studio recordings until the release of &quot;Crash&quot; in 1996. &quot;#36&quot; was later reworked into the song &quot;Everyday,&quot; which was included on the album of the same name in 2001. Also included is the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;All Along the Watchtower.&quot;

&quot;Live at Red Rocks&quot; was the first of many live releases by the Dave Matthews Band. Before this release, live concerts were only available as bootleg recordings, which lacked audio mixing and remastering. Despite being a live release, the album was very successful during its release, hitting #3 on the album charts, and selling over two million copies. This release has so far been the band&#x27;s most successful live release. Due to its popularity, the band went on to release numerous other live albums, including another from Red Rocks, &quot;Weekend on the Rocks&quot; featuring highlights from a four-night stand at Red Rocks in 2005.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio Edinburgh, Lothians &amp; Fife (formerly Forth 2) is an Independent Local Radio station based in Edinburgh, Scotland, owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Edinburgh, The Lothians, Fife and Falkirk.

As of December 2023, the station has a weekly audience of 108,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==
Radio Forth was launched on 22 January 1975 by its then managing director the late Richard Findlay. His opening speech included &quot;This, for the very first time is Radio Forth&quot;. Steve Hamilton was the first on-air presenter, hosting the breakfast show.

In 1990, Forth was forced to create a new station on its AM frequency. Before this, Radio Forth was broadcast as a single station on both FM and AM frequencies. The FM station was renamed Radio Forth RFM, with Donny Hughes broadcasting the first Breakfast Show from the newly revamped Studio F in Forth House. The station became known as Forth FM in 1993. The new AM station became &quot;Max AM&quot; which was later renamed &quot;Forth AM&quot; to match its sister station.

In 2000, both stations were relaunched as 97.3 Forth One and 1548 Forth 2. Many changes occurred at this time including new presenters and a new jingles package. Forth 2 was redesigned as an adult contemporary music station while Forth One continued to play Top 40 songs for the 35s and under.

Radio Forth was owned by Scottish Radio Holdings until 23 June 2005 when British media group EMAP took over. In January 2008, EMAP Radio was sold to Bauer. The radio division was renamed Bauer Radio.

A new programming schedule was introduced on Monday 15 June 2009, consisting mostly of programming simulcast with Bauer&#x27;s other AM stations in Scotland – Clyde 2 from Glasgow, Northsound 2 from Aberdeen, Tay 2 from Dundee and West Sound AM from Ayr. Forth 2 local programming was then restricted to breakfast shows, news bulletins and some specialist programming although the station also produced networked output on weekday evenings and Sunday mornings.

On 3 June 2013, station owners Bauer Radio announced Forth 2 would axe its remaining local programming with the weekday breakfast show, presented by Bob Malcolm, replaced with a networked show hosted by Robin Galloway from Monday 1 July 2013 across Bauer&#x27;s network of AM stations in Scotland. The station became part of the Bauer City 2 network on Monday 5 January 2015.

On 17 June 2022, Forth 2 along with sister station Forth 1, moved into new studios in St James Quarter, Edinburgh, after leaving their long term home in Forth House.

On 12 November 2023, it was announced that the station would cease broadcasting on medium wave before the end of the year, but would continue on DAB.

==Programming==

Much of the station&#x27;s programming was produced in Greatest Hits Radio&#x27;s studios in Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Some output is produced from GHR&#x27;s Birmingham, London and Manchester studios and broadcast on both networks in Scotland and England.

===News===
Forth 2 broadcast local news bulletins hourly from 6am to 7pm on weekdays and from 7am to 1pm at weekends. Headlines were broadcast on the half hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside sport and traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio were carried overnight with bespoke networked Scottish bulletins at weekends, produced from Radio Clyde&#x27;s newsroom in Clydebank.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio North East Scotland is an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire on DAB digital radio and online. Owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network of classic hit music stations in England, Scotland and Wales, carrying networked programmes originating mainly from Glasgow and Manchester 24 hours a day, featuring local news and traffic bulletins.

The station relaunched as &quot;Greatest Hits Radio North East Scotland&quot; on 3 April 2023.

As of December 2023, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 37,000, according to RAJAR.

==History==
Northsound 2 was established on 9 January 1995 as a sister station to Northsound Radio, which was renamed Northsound 1 at the same time, and broadcast using the older station&#x27;s AM frequency.

On 3 June 2013, station owners Bauer Radio announced that Northsound 2 would axe its one remaining local programme, the weekday breakfast show which was presented by John McRuvie, and replace it with a networked show hosted by Robin Galloway from Monday 1 July 2013 across all of Bauer&#x27;s network of AM stations in Scotland. The station became part of the Bauer City 2 network (since rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio) upon its launch on Monday 5 January 2015.

On Tuesday 3 April 2018, Northsound 2 ceased broadcasting on AM and became a digital-only station on DAB and online. It is the first commercial radio station in Scotland - and the first of Bauer&#x27;s local stations - to cease analogue broadcasting in favour of a digital switchover.

==Programming==

The vast majority of the station&#x27;s programming is produced at Greatest Hits Radio&#x27;s studios in Birmingham, London and Manchester studios and broadcast on both networks in Scotland and England, with the only Scotland-wide show being the breakfast show which comes from Glasgow. No programming originates from within its transmission area.

<text>The Royal Gibraltar Regiment is part of British Forces Gibraltar for the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, which historically, along with Bermuda, Halifax, Nova Scotia (prior to the 1867 Confederation of Canada which resulted in the British Army withdrawing from those colonies of British North America which joined the new dominion, other than small garrisons protecting Royal Naval facilities, and the 1905 closure of the Royal Naval yards at Halifax and Esquimalt), and Malta, had been designated an Imperial fortress rather than a colony. It was formed in 1958 from the Gibraltar Defence Force as an infantry unit, with an integrated artillery troop. The regiment is included in the British Army as a defence engagement force.

==History==

===18th century===
The earliest verifiable historical evidence of local civilians enrolled to defend Gibraltar dates to 24 June 1720 and, by 1755, an armed organisation of local men were mounting guard on the picket line from Bayside to Devil&#x27;s Tower to prevent soldiers from the garrison deserting across to the enemy.
These men were known as the Genoese Guard and were disbanded at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

During the Great Siege of Gibraltar, 160 local labourers volunteered to take part in the action during the night of 26/27 November 1781. They were tasked with following the advancing troops and assisting in the dismantling and demolition of the Spanish batteries, magazines and trenches.

===19th century===
During the Sudan Campaign 100 local men were deployed by the commissariat as transport drivers, known as &quot;Los Carreteros Del Rey (The King&#x27;s Cart Drivers)&quot;. The expedition was involved in several battles with the Dervishes. During a parade held in Gibraltar, the cart drivers were awarded the Egyptian War Medal with a clasp bearing the title &#x27;Suakin 1885&#x27;.

===20th century===
During the Second Boer War, in 1900, a group of Gibraltarians offered to form a &quot;Local Corps of Volunteers&quot;. The suggestion was made that some of the Volunteers might be organised as a Rifle Corps. However, the war was over before the Corps was formed.

====World War I====
During World War I, a group of local rowing club members volunteered to take up arms. Such was the interest that soon some 400 Gibraltarians joined. One of their tasks was to act as stretcher bearers for the many casualties arriving on hospital ships from Gallipoli. The wounded were taken to the Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar and a number of temporary hospitals. The volunteers obtained recognition from the governor, General Sir Herbert Miles, on 3 July 1915. Addressing the volunteers at Wellington Front, the governor said that the Corps had &quot;come into being not because of any official demand but as a result of their patriotic fervour and of their love and respect for the Crown&quot;.

The Corps was based at Orange Bastion, with its headquarters on the ground floor of what is now City Hall. Later, the group moved to Wellington Front. The volunteers were divided into four rifle companies, A, B, C and D: each was commanded by a captain, with two subalterns, one sergeant major, four sergeants, eight corporals, two buglers and about 80 men. The first commanding officer was Major G B Roberts of the Royal Engineers. During the war, the Corps provided reinforcement to assist in the defence of the Rock. The Corps was disbanded on 1 February 1920.

====World War II====
In 1938, the Governor, General Sir Edmund Ironside, formed a Territorial Artillery unit to help man the anti-aircraft guns on Gibraltar. The Volunteers paraded for the first time on 28 April 1939. Just before the outbreak of the war, more volunteers were called for and men were allocated to the 4th and 27th Coast Batteries of the Royal Artillery as well as to the Royal Signals, Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps.

On 2 September 1939, the Gibraltar Defence Force was mobilised. The Heavy Anti Aircraft section was attached to 19 AA Battery Royal Artillery and deployed with two 3 inch guns to the Admiralty oil tanks, on the east side of the Rock.
They fired their first shots in anger on 7 July 1940 and from then on they were often in action against Vichy French and Italian planes, engaging German planes later in the war. They shot down their first enemy aircraft on the night of 20 August 1940. The entry in the unit&#x27;s War Diary reads as follows:
Early in 1944, the force was reconstituted under the Defence Force Ordinance 1943. The majority of volunteers were placed on the reserve list, with other sections disbanded.

===Post war===
On 30 August 1958, the permanent cadre and the reserve of the Gibraltar Defence Force was formed into the Gibraltar Regiment. The regiment then had a dual role, being organised as an infantry battalion with four rifle companies and an artillery troop manning the coastal guns. This organisation was to remain in force until 1971. With the departure of the last gunner unit in 1958, the regiment was issued with four 25 pounder (88 mm) guns and took over the responsibilities of firing Royal Gun Salutes.

On 25 September 1971, the regiment was presented with its first colours. At a ceremony held at the Grand Parade, the Governor, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Varyl Begg, presented the regiment with its colours on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. On the same day, the regiment was granted the Freedom of the City of Gibraltar by the Mayor of Gibraltar, Alfred Vazquez, during a ceremony outside the House of Assembly.

The artillery battery was named Thomson&#x27;s Battery on 15 September 1973 in honour of the late Sir Willie Thomson OBE JP; and, in December 1975, Thomson&#x27;s Battery was issued with three 105mm L5 Pack Howitzers. Following Operation Corporate, the Ministry of Defence decided, in line with its policy of modernisation and commonality of equipment, to re-equip the regiment with new weapons. In late 1982, six 105mm L118 light guns guns replaced the three howitzers and eight Blowpipe surface-to-air missile units replaced the four L40/70 AA Guns.
On 1 April 1991, the regiment was reorganised into an all-infantry unit and took over the duties of the resident infantry battalion. The re-roled regiment consisted of a headquarters company (Thomson&#x27;s Bty), a military band and three rifle companies of which G and I companies were regular and B Company (and the band) consisted of TA soldiers.

On 1 July 1998, the Duke of Kent presented the regiment with its new colours.

===21st century===
The regiment has supplied officers and men for the conflicts in Northern Ireland, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. It is in these theatres that members of the regiment have been decorated with two Bronze Stars and a Military Cross. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment signed up to the Armed Forces Act 2011 to bring it in line with British Armed Forces. It was signed by Governor of Gibraltar Ed Davis (Royal Marines officer) on board in 2018 along with Fabian Picardo and Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster.

On 31 March 2022 the Royal Gibraltar Regiment was presented with New Colours by HRH Earl of Wessex at Windsor Castle.

==Structure==

Initially a reserve force, on the withdrawal of the British Army garrison from the territory in 1991, the regiment was reorganised into an all-infantry unit and took over the duties of the resident battalion. The re-roled regiment consisted of a headquarters company (Thompson&#x27;s Battery) and three rifle companies of which B Company is the reserve element with the others being made up of regular soldiers. As of 2023, the regiment was reported to have a strength of 235 personnel, meaning that most component companies and platoons were understrength. Component elements of the regiment consisted of:

* HQ Company (Thomson&#x27;s Battery, Regular) - made up currently of the Artillery Troop (L118 105mm light guns), Motor Transport Platoon, Signals Wing, Catering Platoon and Clothing Stores.
* G Company (Regular) – comprises three regular rifle platoons.
* I Company (Regular) – a regular rifle company, but also holds the regiment&#x27;s specialists when fully manned. These are:
** 2 × recce sections,
** 5 × sniper pairs,
** 2 × machine gun sections,
** 2 × assault pioneer/soldier sections,
** 2 × high-assurance search teams,
** 2 × low-risk search teams,
** The regiment&#x27;s explosive ordnance disposal teams (EOD)
* B Company (Reserves) consists of three rifle platoons. It also provides two sharpshooter pairs, two machine gun sections and one low-risk search team.

==Role==

The regiment undertakes army ceremonial tasks in Gibraltar as it is the only major unit based there. It is responsible for the ceremonial guard of the Governor at his residence the Convent, and performing the ceremony of the keys twice a year and the King&#x27;s Birthday Parade in Casemates Square, as well as any other Guards of Honour. In March 2001, for the first time, the regiment mounted the guard at Buckingham Palace. In addition to this, the regiment has fired three 62 Gun Royal salutes at the Tower of London on the occasion of the Birthday of Her Majesty the Queen, a duty normally carried out by the Honourable Artillery Company. The regiment resumed both roles in April 2012 and returned to London once again in March 2022 for public duties.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio Tayside &amp; Fife (formerly Tay AM and Tay 2) is an Independent Local Radio station based in Dundee, Scotland, owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. It is broadcast in Dundee, Perth and Tayside.

As of December 2023, the station has a weekly audience of 35,000 listeners, according to RAJAR.

==History==
Radio Tay commenced broadcasting on 17 October 1980, in Dundee and 14 November 1980 in Perth with Gerry Quinn presenting the first show from the studios. In early years, the station broadcast only from 6am-8pm daily.

On 9 January 1995 the station split its services/frequencies to become Tay AM and Tay FM. Both stations are now also broadcast on DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting – i.e. Digital Radio) and over the internet via their respective websites. 

Tay AM broadcast on 1161 AM in Dundee and 1584 AM in Perth, and was more oriented around older music than its sister station Tay FM, playing more classic hits from the past few decades, along with some of the more easy listening of modern-day offerings.

A new programming schedule was launched on 15 June 2009 introducing which introducing networked programming across Bauer&#x27;s AM network. Tay AM retained its locally produced and presented breakfast and specialist evening shows (Tay AM was the only station to opt out of the network in the evenings, so they could continue to broadcast their heritage specialist shows), some weekend output, and Ally Ballingall&#x27;s weekday mid-morning show, which was broadcast across Scotland from Radio Tay&#x27;s Dundee studios. Outwith these times, programming was simulcast from other stations in the Scottish AM network.

On 3 June 2013, station owners Bauer Radio announced Tay AM would replace its weekday breakfast show beginning on 1 July 2013 with a networked show hosted by Robin Galloway across Bauer&#x27;s network of AM stations in Scotland. Local news &amp; traffic bulletins were retained with some networked programming broadcast from Tay AM&#x27;s Dundee studios.

In January 2015, Tay AM was renamed Tay 2 and became part of the Greatest Hits Radio network in Scotland and Northern England.

In January 2023, Bauer announced that, on the 3rd of April, it would be rebranding Tay 2- along with several other Scottish stations in the Greatest Hits network- to &quot;Greatest Hits Radio&quot; to match stations in England and Wales.

On 12 November 2023, it was announced that the station would cease broadcasting on medium wave before the end of the year, but would continue on DAB.

==Programming==
Most of Tay 2&#x27;s programming was carried from Greatest Hits Radio&#x27;s network of locally branded Scottish stations with some off-peak output also carried from GHR&#x27;s sister network in England. Most of the output originates from the studios of Clyde 2 in Clydebank, Forth 2 in Edinburgh and Greatest Hits Radio&#x27;s Birmingham, Nottingham, London and Manchester studios. Occasional programming was produced and broadcast from MFR 2 in Inverness, Northsound 2 in Aberdeen and West Sound in Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway.

<text>Sonatane Tu&#x27;akinamolahi Taumopeau Tupou, Lord Taumoepeau-Tupou of Toula and Kotu (born 14 March 1943, in Nukuʻalofa, died 13 August 2013) was a diplomat from the Kingdom of Tonga. Lord Taumoepeau-Tupou had been the foreign minister of Tonga since 24 August 2004, though his appointment was not announced until 2 September 2004. He had also been Minister of Defense since April 2005 till his death.

Taumoepeau-Tupou was Tonga&#x27;s third foreign minister, after King George Tupou V (at that time: Tupoutoʻa Lavaka), and most recently Prince Ahoeitu Unuakiotonga Tukuaho (at that time: Lavaka Ata Ulukālala). Taumoepeau-Tupou was a career diplomat. He had previously been Tonga&#x27;s first ambassador to the United Nations after Tonga joined the United Nations in September 1999. During his tenure at the United Nations he was also accredited as Tonga&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States and High Commissioner to Canada.

On 1 May 2009, he relinquished his position as a Cabinet Minister, to take up more diplomatic positions.

== Early life ==

Taumoepeau-Tupou was born in Nukualofa, Tonga to Samiuela Ma&#x27;afu Tupou and Lu&#x27;isa Ma&#x27;ume&#x27;afo&#x27;ou Taumoepeau. He was raised by Tevita Fa&#x27;ahivalu Taumoepeau and &#x27;Ainise Kilinalivoni Tongilava. He attended primary school in Nukuʻalofa and Neiafu on Vava&#x27;u and continued his secondary education at Newington College, Stanmore, Sydney in 1953–1962, where he was known as Tom Tu&#x27;a. He later received his B.Sc. degree in Political Science from the University of Hawaii, under a scholarship from the East-West Center.

He married &#x27;Amelia Latuniua Ahome&#x27;e, the youngest daughter of the Noble &#x27;Ahome&#x27;e and Heu&#x27;ifanga Veikune. They had four children, and one of his daughters, Princess Marcella Kalaniuvalu-Fotofili (known previously as Lady Kalaniuvalu-Fotofili) married the son of Princess Mele Siu&#x27;ilikutapu Kalaniuvalu-Fotofili (eldest daughter of Sione Ngū Manumataongo and Princess Melenaite Tupoumoheofo Veikune) and Prince Kalaniuvalu-Fotofili (whom was formerly known as Lord Kalaniuvalu-Fotofili).

== Career ==

He joined the Tongan Civil Service in 1969 as an assistant secretary in the prime minister&#x27;s office. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Tonga Defence Services in 1971 and was posted to the Tonga High Commission in London as a First Secretary in 1973. In 1977 he re-joined the prime minister&#x27;s office as an assistant secretary and was seconded to the Palace Office, where he was promoted to deputy secretary in 1978 and also appointed secretary to the Tongan Defence Board.

He was promoted to secretary for foreign affairs in 1979 and in 1983 he was posted as Tonga&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and concurrently appointed as ambassador to the then European Community and the European Commission as well as to Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the then Soviet Union and the United States of America.

In 1986 he returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In 1999 he was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and Permanent Representative of Tonga to the United Nations and further appointed concurrently as Tonga&#x27;s Ambassador Extraordinary and Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States and Tonga&#x27;s High Commissioner to Canada before being recalled to take up his ministerial appointments.

Since his appointment as Foreign Minister Taumoepeau-Tupou was also appointed as Tonga&#x27;s Acting defence minister on 22 April 2005 following the sudden death of Colonel &#x27;Aloua Fetu&#x27;utolu Tupou. He was also appointed as the Acting Governor of Vava&#x27;u following the death of the Hon. ʻAkauʻola.

In June 2009, Taumoepeau-Tupou became Tonga&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, a position that has concurrent accreditation as Tongan Ambassador to the United States, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela, and Tongan High Commissioner to Canada. He presented his credentials as Ambassador to the United States of America on 22 February 2010. He presented his credentials as High Commissioner to Canada on 19 May 2010.

On 28 March 2011, he was created a Tongan life peer by King George Tupou V with the noble title of Lord Taumoepeau-Tupou of Toula and Kotu.

==Controversy==
In April 2010, a 3-year Royal Land Commission investigation headed by Lord Fielakepa as chairman investigated corrupt land dealing, and implicated that Taumoepeau-Tupou had acted unethically in his role as Acting Governor of Vava&#x27;u. The final land commission report stated &quot;that the Acting Governor Tu&#x27;a Taumoepeau has a lot of explaining to give&quot; and recommended that Government investigate the whole background to the registration and the involvement of the then Acting Governor Tu&#x27;a Taumoepeau in these dealings.

<text>Scottish Radio Holdings (SRH) was a Scottish media company which owned 22 radio stations, and around 30 local newspapers in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

==History==

SRH had its origins in the 1970s when Glasgow was awarded the third licence for a commercial station in the UK. As a result, in 1973 Radio Clyde began broadcasting. Unlike the two existing commercial stations (both in London), Radio Clyde was an immediate success. This was helped in part by strong financial backers that included Sean Connery and Jackie Stewart.

In 1991 laws controlling the ownership of commercial stations were relaxed. Clyde merged with Radio Forth to form SRH and immediately floated on the London Stock Exchange.

In 1995 it acquired Morton Newspapers which owned around 20 newspapers in Northern Ireland. Since then SRH expanded operations by acquiring further publications in Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.

SRH had a network of 22 stations when it was acquired by rival media group Emap on 21 June 2005. The newspaper titles published by SRH, collectively known as &quot;Score Press&quot;, was sold to Johnston Press for £155million. The group&#x27;s newspaper interests were sold off as were the firm&#x27;s radio operations in the Republic of Ireland. SRH&#x27;s UK radio operations were integrated into those of Emap with the two SRH-owned Vibe FM stations becoming Kiss 101 and Kiss 105-108. The group&#x27;s FM stations in Scotland formed a local version of the Big City Network which Emap were already operating in England. Emap also took on SRH&#x27;s AM stations in Scotland, Wave 105 on England&#x27;s south coast, and two stations in Northern Ireland from SRH.

In December 2007, Emap announced that their consumer media interests including radio stations would be sold to Hamburg based Bauer Media Group.

<text>Remember Two Things is the first full-length album release by the Dave Matthews Band. It was released independently through the band&#x27;s own Bama Rags label on November 9, 1993. The album received wider release with a reissue by RCA Records on June 24, 1997, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2002. Consisting of live tracks interspersed with studio recordings, the album contains many songs that have remained setlist staples for the band.

==Overview==

&quot;The Song That Jane Likes&quot; is named after Matthews&#x27; younger sister. In concert, he often prefaces the song by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a little sister named Jane. This is the song that Jane likes.&quot;

All songs are live recordings except for &quot;Minarets&quot; and &quot;Seek Up&quot; (and, on reissues, &quot;Pay for What You Get&quot; and &quot;Typical Situation&quot;), which were recorded in-studio. &quot;I&#x27;ll Back You Up&quot; and &quot;Christmas Song&quot; are acoustic performance by Matthews and Tim Reynolds; all other songs feature the entire band. Matthews has been cited as saying that &quot;I&#x27;ll Back You Up&quot; was recorded in a closet near a bathroom, and the version on the album is the one &quot;with no flushing sounds in it.&quot;

&quot;Ants Marching&quot; and &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; were recorded at The Muse in Nantucket, Massachusetts, on August 17, 1993. &quot;Recently&quot; was recorded at The Flood Zone in Richmond, Virginia on August 10, 1993.

&quot;Ants Marching&quot; and &quot;Satellite&quot; later appeared on the 1994 album &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, while &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; appeared on its 1996 follow-up, &quot;Crash&quot;.

==Packaging==
The album cover art is an autostereogram that, when focused on correctly, shows a person&#x27;s hand displaying a peace sign. It was created by two former UVA students in Charlottesville: Rick Kwiatkowski and Jeff Smith. The general consensus among Dave Matthews Band fan websites is that the two things referred to in the title are &quot;love your mother&quot; and &quot;leave only footprints&quot; as well as the two fingers displayed in the aforementioned cover.

==Track listing==
All songs written by David J. Matthews, except &quot;The Song That Jane Likes&quot; written with Mark Roebuck.


Notes: &quot;Ants Marching&quot; includes an excerpt from &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; (Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith).

Following &quot;Christmas Song&quot; is a hidden track with an outro to &quot;Seek Up&quot;, followed by the ambient sounds of a thunderstorm and crickets.

<text>Bocaue , officially the Municipality of Bocaue (), is a municipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 141,412 people.

Among its tourist attractions are a town museum located near the municipality&#x27;s center and the town&#x27;s river festival celebrated on the first Sunday of every July. The river festival is in commemoration of the Holy Cross of Wawa, believed to be miraculous by the town&#x27;s predominantly Roman Catholic population.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name comes from the Old Tagalog word &quot;Bukawe&quot;, which refers to a type of long bamboo (&quot;Schyzostachyum lima&quot;).

==History==
Bocaue was first established by Franciscan missionaries as a barrio and visita of Meycauayan in 1582 and as a town on April 11, 1606, under the advocacy of San Martin de Tours. It was the first town to be granted independence from the old Meycauayan that was then a very large town comprising the present territories of Meycauayan City, Marilao, Santa Maria, San Jose del Monte City, Obando, and Valenzuela City.

After the Philippine–American War, the Philippine Commission was established, part of whose functions was the reorganization of Philippine municipalities and provinces. In 1903, Bulacan province reduced the number of towns from 26 to 19. The town of Balagtas merged with Bocaue, with the former serving as the seat of government from October 8 to November 20 before it was transferred to the latter. Bocaue later regained its independence and was reestablished as a town in 1911.

During the Bocaue River Festival of July 2, 1993, around 500 people rode the &quot;floating pagoda&quot; for the Holy Cross of Wawa way beyond the boat&#x27;s capacity and caused the boat to sink, killing more than two hundred people. Despite the lives lost, no one has been made accountable for the tragedy. This incident became known as the Bocaue Pagoda Tragedy.

On the morning of December 31, 2007, ten fireworks stores burned in Barangay Turo, causing a series of explosions within the area and injuring 7 people.

==Geography==
Bocaue is north-east of Manila if reached via the MacArthur Highway and is from Malolos City. It is at the mid-southwestern portion of Bulacan. Its land area is 3,187 hectares or 31.87 km2 (12.31 sq mi).

The town is bounded on the north by the municipality of Balagtas and a portion of the municipality of Santa Maria; by the municipalities of Marilao and Obando on the south; a larger portion of Santa Maria on the east; a portion of the municipality of Bulakan on the extreme southwestern side; and a portion of Balagtas on the western side.

Bocaue is traversed by the Bocaue River, a continuation of the confluence of Santa Maria River and San Jose River and a few other minor rivers and creeks, all of which are distributaries of the Angat drainage basin. The main source of Angat River and the Angat drainage basin, as well as their distributaries, is the Sierra Madre mountain range. Along these rivers are many man-made fish ponds used for raising and farming fish like bangus and tilapia.

Bocaue, along with Balagtas, Guiguinto, and Pandi, was once known as comprising the 2nd district of Bulacan. The grouping would later be known as the 5th district of Bulacan. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, Bocaue is part of Manila&#x27;s built-up area which reaches San Ildefonso in its northernmost part. The Bocaue River runs through most of the municipality.

The Feast of the Holy Cross of Wawa is a festival held on the first Sunday of July, observed in honor of the Holy Cross of Wawa (Mahal na Krus sa Wawa), a relic believed to have saved the life of an old woman drowning in the Bocaue River. The main feature of this fiesta is the Pagoda, a gaily decorated structure riding on a huge bangka, which glides along the town river carrying people from all walks of life.

Other religious denominations in the town include Iglesia ni Cristo, Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, Methodist, Aglipayan, Adventist, Baptist, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The town&#x27;s major industry is fireworks-making, which has earned it the tag &quot;Fireworks Capital of the Philippines&quot;. Among the prominent firecracker stores in Bocaue is Eat Bulaga Fireworks, owned by fireworks maker Rommel Eustaquio and named after &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot;, the longest-running noontime variety program in the Philippines.

<text>Samuel Lewis Navarro (born 15 July 1957, in Panama City) is a Panamanian businessman who served as the First Vice President and foreign minister from 2004 to 2009 during the administration of President Martín Torrijos.

Lewis was elected First Vice President of the Republic of Panama for the period 2004-2009 by popular vote on May 2, 2004. He took oath on September 1 together with President Martín Torrijos and Second Vice President Rubén Arosemena. On the same day, Lewis also became the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was elected to the first Vice Presidency of the Republic on the ballot propositions of &quot;Patria Nueva&quot;, a political program endorsed by the Revolutionary Democratic Party and the Popular Party, advocating more employment, more production and zero corruption.

He studied business administration at prestigious academic institutions in the United States, earning a BA from Georgetown University in 1979 and an MBA from American University in 1981, both in Washington, D.C.

==Family life==

Samuel Lewis was born into a family with a tradition of public service, particularly in the international field. His great-grandfather, Samuel Lewis García de Paredes (1871–1939), as well as his grandfather, Samuel Lewis Arango (1901–1972), and his father, Gabriel Lewis (1929–1996), all held the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs of Panama before him.

Samuel Lewis is married to Anagrethel González, and they have two children. He was previously married to Mariela Delvalle, the daughter of former President Eric Delvalle and has two more children.

==Business career==
Samuel Lewis began his business career in his family&#x27;s company Empaques de Colon, where he became the general manager and president. He went on to work for other corporations, including the ELE Group, a packaging company with investments in Central America, the Caribbean and Mexico; Northsound Corporation, engaged in the production and distribution of bananas; and Red Crown Corporation, the biggest Central American company operating with regional capital dedicated to growing and selling pineapples to markets in Europe and North America. He is also the President of Calder International, a real estate company involved in housing development projects in Panama City. Since 1981 he has been a member of the board of directors of eleven industrial, real estate, farming and investment companies.

At the same time, he has participated in business organizations such as the Industrial Guild of Panama; the Panamanian Association of Business Executives (APEDE in Spanish); the Panamanian Association of Exporters (APEX in Spanish); the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce; the American Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Panama (AMCHAM); The Young Presidents&#x27; Organization, and the Gabriel Lewis Galindo Foundation, dedicated to promoting education in Panama.

==Political career==

Lewis&#x27; participation as a citizen concerned with the defense of the interests of his country in the international field was demonstrated by his work as Special Ambassador of Panama (1994–1999) and his voluntary service in organizations and public bodies such as the Advisory Committee of the Panama Canal (1994–1999), the National Council on Foreign Affairs (1999–2003) and the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal Authority (1998–2002). The latter state institution, wholly run by Panama since December 31, 1999, is responsible for the management of the waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Finally, his involvement in partisan politics started in 1993, when he founded the Solidarity Party, of which he was the Vice President from 1993 to 2003. He resigned from it to contribute as an independent citizen to finding solutions to the serious social, political and moral problems facing the Panamanian nation.

<doc id="956071" wikidata="Q616902" url="?curid=956071" title="Windows domain">
<text>A Windows domain is a form of a computer network in which all user accounts, computers, printers and other security principals, are registered with a central database located on one or more clusters of central computers known as domain controllers. Authentication takes place on domain controllers. Each person who uses computers within a domain receives a unique user account that can then be assigned access to resources within the domain. Starting with Windows Server 2000, Active Directory is the Windows component in charge of maintaining that central database. The concept of Windows domain is in contrast with that of a workgroup in which each computer maintains its own database of security principals.

==Configuration==

Computers can connect to a domain via LAN, WAN or using a VPN connection. Users of a domain are able to use enhanced security for their VPN connection due to the support for a certification authority which is gained when a domain is added to a network, and as a result, smart cards and digital certificates can be used to confirm identities and protect stored information.

===Domain controller===
In a Windows domain, the directory resides on computers that are configured as domain controllers. A domain controller is a Windows or Samba server that manages all security-related aspects between user and domain interactions, centralizing security and administration. A domain controller is generally suitable for networks with more than 10 PCs. A domain is a logical grouping of computers. The computers in a domain can share physical proximity on a small LAN or they can be located in different parts of the world. As long as they can communicate, their physical location is irrelevant.

===Integration===
Where PCs running a Windows operating system must be integrated into a domain that includes non-Windows PCs, the free software package Samba is a suitable alternative. Whichever package is used to control it, the database contains the user accounts and security information for the resources in that domain.

==Active Directory==
Computers inside an Active Directory domain can be assigned into organizational units according to location, organizational structure, or other factors. In the original Windows Server Domain system (shipped with Windows NT 3.x/4), machines could only be viewed in two states from the administration tools; computers detected (on the network), and computers that actually belonged to the domain. Active Directory makes it easier for administrators to manage and deploy network changes and policies (see Group Policy) to all of the machines connected to the domain.

==Workgroups==

Windows Workgroups, by contrast, is the other model for grouping computers running Windows in a networking environment which ships with Windows. Workgroup computers are considered to be &#x27;standalone&#x27; - i.e. there is no formal membership or authentication process formed by the workgroup. A workgroup does not have servers and clients, and hence represents the peer-to-peer (or client-to-client) networking paradigm, rather than the centralized architecture constituted by Server-Client. Workgroups are considered difficult to manage beyond a dozen clients, and lack single sign on, scalability, resilience/disaster recovery functionality, and many security features. Windows Workgroups are more suitable for small or home-office networks.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance was awarded from 1991 to 2011, alongside the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Previously, a single award was presented for Best Rap Performance.

In 2003, this award was split into separate awards for Best Female Rap Solo Performance and Best Male Rap Solo Performance. In 2005, it was again presented as a single award.

As of 2012, the award was permanently discontinued due to a major overhaul of Grammy categories. Since 2012, all solo and duo/group rap performances has been shifted to the revived [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]] category.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released from October a year and a half prior to September the previous year.

<doc id="956078" wikidata="Q258750" url="?curid=956078" title="India Arie">
<text>India Arie Simpson (sometimes styled as india.arie) (born October 3, 1975) is an American singer and songwriter. Her debut album, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot;, was released in 2001, and she has since released six more studio albums. Arie has sold over five million records in the US and ten million worldwide, and has won four Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, including Best R&amp;B Album.

==Background==
India was born in Denver, the daughter of Joyce and Ralph Simpson. Her musical skills were encouraged by both parents in her younger years. Her mother is a former singer (she was signed to Motown as a teenager and opened for Stevie Wonder and Al Green) and has become Arie&#x27;s stylist. She has an older brother named J&#x27;On and younger sister Mary A Martin of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Arie is African-American, and according to a DNA analysis, she descends from the Mende people of Sierra Leone, the Kru of Liberia and the Fula of Guinea-Bissau.

After Arie&#x27;s parents divorced, her mother moved the family to Atlanta when India was 13. Arie&#x27;s had taken up a succession of musical instruments throughout her schooling in Denver. But her interest in the guitar, while attending the Savannah College of Art and Design, led to a personal revelation about songwriting and performing. &quot;When I started tapping into my own sensitivity, I started to understand people better. It was a direct result of writing songs&quot;, she said at the press release of her debut album, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot;.

Co-founding the Atlanta-based independent music collective Government Earthseed (Government was the collective artists&#x27; name and Earthseed was their independent label name), her one-song turn on a locally released compilation led to a second-stage gig at the 1998 Lilith Fair. In 1999, a Universal/Motown music scout signed her and made an introduction to former Motown CEO Kedar Massenburg. Arie resided in New York City for over a decade, before moving back to Atlanta to focus on her career and music. .

Named to Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s &quot;SuperSoul100&quot; list of visionaries and influential leaders, India.Arie performed Songversation during 2017 motivational cruises.

==Career==
Arie released her debut album &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; on March 27, 2001. The album was met with positive reviews and commercial success. &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; debuted at number ten on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number three on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Within months, without the concentrated radio airplay that typically powers pop and rap albums, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling 2,180,000 copies in the U.S. and 3,000,000 copies worldwide.
The album was also certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry
and platinum by Music Canada. The album was promoted with the release of the lead single &quot;Video&quot;. &quot;Video&quot; attained commercial success peaking at 47 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and becoming her highest-charting song in the region to date. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Brown Skin&quot; failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but it became her highest-charting single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 29.

Arie performed a duet with rock singer-guitarist John Mellencamp on the song &quot;Peaceful World&quot; for his 2001 album &quot;Cuttin&#x27; Heads&quot;. While Arie and the album were nominated for seven Grammy awards in 2002, they won no awards, losing in five of seven categories to Alicia Keys.

<text>Warda Al-Jazairia (; born Warda Mohammed Ftouki (); 22 July 1939 – 17 May 2012) was an Algerian singer. She was well known for her Egyptian Arabic songs and music. Her name was sometimes shortened to just Warda ( meaning &quot;rose&quot;) or as &quot;The Algerian rose&quot; in the Arab world.

==Early life==

Warda Ftouki was born in Paris on July 22, 1939. Her father, Mohammed Ftouki, was an Algerian from Souk Ahras, and her mother was Lebanese. She was the youngest of five children.

Warda began singing in the 1950s. She made her debut at the Tam-Tam, a cabaret owned by her father Located on rue Saint-Séverin, in the Latin Quarter, it is home to many famous stars of Arabic song, such as Safia Chamia and Farid El Atrache.

=== The TAM-TAM: Warda&#x27;s first stage ===

Mohammed Ftouki opened the in 1951 acrostic of &quot;Tunisia - Algeria - Morocco&quot;, at a time when several other establishments of the kind appeared such as El Djazaïr, El Koutoubia, Baghdad...
An establishment which had quickly become very successful. Farid al-Atrash had sung there. Salim Al Hillali, the other souk-ahrassien, had sung there every night for years.
Receptacles and laboratories of modern Arab singers, these cabarets are also meeting places for the diasporas where ideas circulate, genuine places of expression of thought. Thus, during the War of Liberation, the Tam-Tam became a secret address of the French Federation of the FLN, as a cache of weapons. Indeed, &quot;Le Tam-Tam&quot; was linked to the headquarters of the MTLD, the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Freedoms, the political party for Algerian independence. The cabaret adjoined the MTLD headquarters and was under police surveillance. Mohammed Ftouki was subsequently denounced and imprisoned.

Following his release, he went into exile in Beirut with his family and devoted himself to the artistic training of his children, in particular Warda and Messaoud, a percussionist and composer. Both Warda and her brother&#x27;s talents thrived thanks to the devoted efforts of their father.
Mohammed Ftouki died in Cairo in 1961 where he is buried.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===

At the age of 11, Warda sang in a show hosted by Ahmed Hachlaf, which was broadcast on Paris Inter. In 1950, she recorded her first record for Pathé-Marconi.

In 1956, after the outbreak of the Algerian war, weapons intended for the FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front) were discovered by the police in her father&#x27;s cabaret. The establishment was closed, and their family expelled. They made plans to move to Hamra, a district of Beirut known for its nightlife. However, her mother died before they could arrive.

Warda sang in Beirut&#x27;s cabarets. In 1959, at a casino in Aley, she met the composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab, who taught her the art of classical singing and adapted the poet Ahmed Shawqi&#x27;s qasida &quot;Bi-Omri Kullo Habbitak&quot; for her. This led to her introduction to the Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, who suggested that she be cast in a pan-Arab opera and perform the song &quot;Al Watan Al Akbar&quot; by Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Warda recorded it, as did other singers such as Abdel Halim Hafez and Fayza Ahmed. The Egyptian director of musicals, Helmy Rafla, signed her to a contract, enabling her to pursue a musical and film career in Egypt. She appeared in two of Rafla&#x27;s films, &quot;Almaz We Abdo El-Hamouly&quot; and &quot;Amirat al-Arab.&quot;

===Career interruption===

Warda&#x27;s father died in 1961. After independence, she went to Algeria for the first time and married an officer who forbade her to sing. She took a ten-year hiatus from music, instead choosing to raise her children. She had a daughter named Widad and a son named Riad, who was named after the composer Riad Al Sunbati.

===Return to singing===

In 1972, at the request of Algerian president Houari Boumédiène, Warda took part in the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Algeria&#x27;s independence by performing in Algiers with an Egyptian orchestra.

Following that performance, Warda and her husband divorced by mutual consent, and she decided to resume her career. She returned permanently to Egypt, where she married the composer Baligh Hamdi. She enjoyed great popularity and had the opportunity to work with the greatest Arab composers, such as Helmi Bakr, Riad Al Sunbati, Sadok Thraya, Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Mohammed Al-Mougi, and Sayed Mekawy. Egyptian president Anwar Sadat banned her from performing in Egypt because a song from her repertoire, &quot;Inkan el-Ghala Yenzad&quot;, praised the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The ban was lifted thanks to the intervention of his wife Jehan.

In 1979, Warda returned to France to give a recital at the Olympia.

===Since the 1990s===

In 1990, Warda divorced her second husband, who died in Paris three years later. Her career went into eclipse as new musical styles emerged. However, she was able to return to the forefront due to her popular performances of songs by the composer Salah El-Sharnoubi, such as &quot;Harramt Ahebak&quot;, &quot;Batwanes Beek&quot;, and &quot;Ya Khsara&quot;.

She began to develop health problems, which kept her away from the stage. In 1996, she underwent heart surgery, which was followed by a liver transplant in the early 2000s.

In 1999, a &quot;best of&quot; compilation called &quot;Nagham El-Hawa&quot; was released, which featured her most popular songs. Her last studio album was recorded in 2001.

Warda visited Lebanon in the 2000s to perform at the Baalbeck International Festival. She sang there in 2005 and again in 2008, attracting nearly 3,000 spectators. That same year, she travelled to Algeria and gave various concerts in Djemila, at the Casif Theatre in Sidi Fredj, and at the 4th International Festival. In 2009, Warda took part in the opening night of the 2nd Pan-African Festival in Algiers. She also performed in Morocco during the 8th edition of the Mawazine, where she sang in front of 30,000 people. One of her last concerts took place in Lebanon in September 2011.

==Political engagement==

The first song Warda recorded in the 1950s was a patriotic Algerian song. She later sang songs celebrating the struggle and independence of Algeria, such as Saïdouna Ila El Djibal, Min baide (From afar), Aid El Karama (The Festival of Dignity), Soummam and Biladi Ouhibouki. Before her death, the singer made a video-clip entitled Mazal wakfin (We are still standing), celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of independence.

==Death and aftermath==
Warda died on 17 May 2012 at her home in Cairo following a cardiac arrest that occurred during her sleep. She was 72 years old. Her body was flown back to her homeland, Algeria, and she was given a state funeral. She was buried on 19 May in the &quot;Martyrs&#x27; Square&quot; of the El Alia Cemetery in Algiers, which is reserved for national heroes.

Her death interrupted the filming of the music video for the song &quot;Eyyam&quot;, directed by Mounes Khammar. In May 2013, the music video was presented to the press. The sequences featuring the missing singer were digitally inserted using the animation technique, rotoscoping. The song, which was composed by Bilal Zain and written by lyricist Mounir Bou Assaf, was recorded in 2009.

==Legacy==
===Musical style and posterity===
The musicologist Daniel Caux considered Warda to have possessed all the qualities necessary for a singer from the Arab world. He emphasized the accuracy of her intonation, her sense of rhythm and her mastery of nuances, in particular, which he thought enriched her singing. According to Caux, Warda succeeds in combining power and delicacy.

Warda was one of the few singers renowned throughout the Arab world, from the Maghreb to the Mashriq. She is considered a &quot;diva&quot; of Arab song, in the same way as Umm Kulthum, Sabah, and Fairuz. Her repertoire includes more than 300 songs. During her career, Warda has sold tens of millions of albums.

===Tributes===

On 10 March 2018, the Ensemble Mazzika in Paris paid tribute to Warda in a concert at the Cabaret Sauvage.

On 30 November 2019, a concert in tribute to Warda was organised by the Ensemble Mazzika and the Lebanese singer Ranine Chaar at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris.

On 2021, The Arab World Institute in Paris pays tribute to &quot;The Arab World Divas&quot;, among them, Warda. The exhibition displays the greatest female Arab artists in the 20th century, legendary artists, timeless icons, all the actresses and singers who took part in the evolution of the post-war Arabic societies and who remain references idolized by everyone.

Warda was a gourmet cook, and did not let being a Muslim stand in the way of using wine in cooking. She told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Akhbar, at her home overlooking the Nile, she loved: &quot;Cooking, looking after my beloved cats and listening to old songs.&quot;

==Distinctions==
In November 2004, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Algerian Revolution, Warda was awarded the El-Athir Medal of the Order of National Merit. In 2009, she was made Commander of the Moroccan Order of Ouissam Alaouite on the instructions of King Mohammed VI, and the Wali of Rabat gave her the keys to the city. In 2012, she was appointed by the French President to the rank of Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters.

In 2012, the singer was named by President Nicolas Sarkozy to the rank of Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

In 2021, the singer was included in the list of 318 Heroes of Diversity appointed by the government of President Emmanuel Macron. The singer was one of 251 men and 67 women, representative of &quot;territorial diversity&quot;, who may inspire future street names or public buildings in France. Among the nominees are great names from literature, art, politics and science, including Emile Zola, Guillaume Apollinaire, Dalida, Serge Gainsbourg, Léopold Sédar Senghor, Salvador Dalí, Pablo Picasso and Emir Abdel Kader.

<doc id="956085" wikidata="Q458564" url="?curid=956085" title="Darius Kasparaitis">
<text>Darius Kasparaitis (born October 16, 1972) is a Lithuanian–American former professional ice hockey defenceman. He mainly played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Pittsburgh Penguins, Colorado Avalanche, and New York Rangers. He is a four-time Olympian and three-time medalist, winning one gold medal, one silver medal, and one bronze medal. He received the title of Honoured Master of Sports of the USSR in 1992 and was inducted into the Russian and Soviet Hockey Hall of Fame in 2016. His 28 career Olympic games is a record among Russian national team&#x27;s players.

==Playing career==
Kasparaitis left Lithuanian SSR for Russian SFSR at age 14 after training with Aleksey Nikiforov to play ice hockey at a higher level. Kasparaitis played his first game for Dynamo Moscow, one of the premier teams in the Soviet Union, at the age of 16 during the 1988–89 season, and won the Soviet League championship with them in 1992. He was drafted by the New York Islanders with the fifth overall pick in the first round of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft. Kasparaitis played for the New York Islanders, Pittsburgh Penguins, Colorado Avalanche, and New York Rangers.

Kasparaitis was known for his aggressive physical playing style and led his teams in hits several times, including his rookie season, in 1992–93 NHL season with the New York Islanders. On November 17, 1996, Kasparaitis was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. While playing for the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1998 Kasparaitis made a hard hit on Eric Lindros that knocked Lindros out of action for 18 games. On March 19, 2002, he was traded to the Colorado Avalanche at the trade deadline, where he spent the remainder of the 2001–02 NHL season. Kasparaitis eventually wound up with the New York Rangers when he was signed on July 2, 2002. During the 2005–06 season, he served as an alternate captain of the Rangers, along with Jaromír Jágr and Steve Rucchin, as the Rangers had no captain.

Because the Lithuanian national ice hockey team was relatively weak and had not ever played in major competitions, Kasparaitis chose to represent Russia in official events. In December 2005, Kasparaitis was chosen to represent Russia in the 2006 Winter Olympics. At the start of the 2006–07 season, Kasparaitis was replaced as an alternate captain with the Rangers by newly acquired Brendan Shanahan. He was waived by the New York Rangers on January 24, 2007 and subsequently demoted to the Rangers&#x27; affiliate in Hartford.

Kasparaitis was once again waived by the Rangers prior to the 2007–08 season. On November 3, 2007, the Rangers announced that Kasparaitis had been loaned to SKA St. Petersburg of the then-Russian Superleague (RSL), now the KHL. The deal was made possible due to a lack of a transfer agreement between Russia and North America at the time. However, the Rangers retained his NHL rights.

Kasparaitis left an enduring impression with Ranger fans with the team salute that he created. After every Rangers home win, Kasparaitis would direct the players to center ice and have the whole team follow in saluting the fans by raising their sticks in the air before departing the ice. The tradition is still carried on by the Rangers for every home win. He continued to play for SKA Saint Petersburg in the 2008–09 season. In 26 games, he contributed a single assist.

In the 2009–10 season, he did not play due to an injury and eventually announced his retirement at the conclusion of the season. Since his retirement he has attempted to become eligible to represent Lithuania internationally, which he finally did in 2018, playing for the team in the World Ice Hockey Championships Division 1B.

==International play==
Kasparaitis first had international experience at the 1990 European Junior Championships. He contributed to the gold medal-winning team by recordings six points (including one goal). The following year, he competed in the 1991 World Junior Championships. He recorded seven points (including one goal) as the Soviet junior team won the gold medal. In August 1991, he joined the Soviet Union senior team and played in two exhibition games against Sweden.

Kasparaitis won a gold medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics as a member of the United Team, and after the Olympics, he played for the Russian national team. He made his first appearance for Russia on 12 April 1992 in a friendly match against Sweden. In the same year, Kasparaitis participated in the 1992 World Championships and the Russian national team finished in fifth place. In 1996, he competed in two international competitions, the 1996 World Championships and the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, finishing fourth in both. In 1998, he participated in the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he reached the final and won a silver medal.

Four years later, Kasparaitis played in his third Olympics at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He scored a goal in the bronze medal match against Belarus to help Russia win the bronze medal. Two years later, he competed in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and recorded two assists in eight games. In 2006, he competed in his last Olympics, the 2006 Winter Olympics, and had two assists in eight games, while the Russian team finished in fourth place.

In 2018, Kasparaitis played for Lithuania national team in the 2018 IIHF World Championship Division I.

==Playing style==

Kasparaitis played the game in the mold of a hard-hitting stay-at-home defenceman, a playing style which in Kasparaitis&#x27;s case also included a substantial amount of agitation. In his rookie season in the NHL in 1992–93, he had already earned a reputation as a pesky player; one hockey pundit at the time wrote that he &quot;shows an unusual lack of respect and deference for established NHL stars.&quot; One such star was Pittsburgh Penguins captain Mario Lemieux; in Game 6 of the Patrick Division finals during the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs, Kasparaitis was &quot;in Lemieux&#x27;s face&quot; for much of the game, at one point giving him a glove to the face and eventually earning a 2-minute elbowing penalty.

During the 1997–98 season, while a member of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Kasparaitis decked Philadelphia Flyers captain Eric Lindros along the boards with a hard and straight hit to the chest, a hit which left Lindros with a concussion and held him out of the game for over a month. The two players later became teammates and friends when Kasparaitis signed with the New York Rangers for the 2002–03 season, with Lindros himself helping to pitch the Rangers as the right destination for Kasparaitis by calling him at midnight on July 1, 2002.

During the 2005–06 NHL season, while playing for the New York Rangers, Kasparaitis had run-ins with New Jersey Devils right winger Grant Marshall, with Kasparaitis delivering a shoulder to the head of Marshall which concussed the New Jersey winger on January 22, and Marshall retaliating on March 4 by sucker-punching Kasparaitis in the head. Marshall stated he had &quot;zero respect&quot; for Kasparaitis. Kasparaitis on the other hand said he was in complete control of his emotions, and that he would not allow his game to become a distraction to his own team.

==Post-retirement==
On June 19, 2010, Kasparaitis signed as the assistant coach for SKA Saint Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). The contract expired on December 22, 2010.

In early 2015, Kasparaitis co-founded the Verzasca Group, a Florida-based real estate development company, of which he holds the title as president. The company is named after the Verzasca river in Switzerland, because of the &quot;transparency that the firm strives to bring to both its investors and its development partners.&quot; Later in the year, the company had gained approval on two residential projects in the Miami area.

==Personal life==
Kasparaitis holds dual Lithuanian and United States citizenship. He is the father of six children. He has a daughter by his first wife, Irina. Kasparaitis&#x27;s current wife, Lisa, is a Swedish designer based in Stockholm and Miami. From 2009 to 2011, he lived in Sweden. They have twin daughters, who were born in Sweden, and three sons.

<doc id="956089" wikidata="Q15728844" url="?curid=956089" title="Marburgvirus">
<text>The genus Marburgvirus is the taxonomic home of &quot;Marburg marburgvirus&quot;, whose members are the two known marburgviruses, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV). Both viruses cause Marburg virus disease in humans and nonhuman primates, a form of viral hemorrhagic fever. Both are select agents, World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogens (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogens, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agents, and are listed as Biological Agents for Export Control by the Australia Group.

==Use of term==
The genus &quot;Marburgvirus&quot; is a virological taxon included in the family &quot;Filoviridae&quot;, order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. The genus currently includes a single virus species, &quot;Marburg marburgvirus&quot;. The members of the genus (i.e. the actual physical entities) are called marburgviruses. The name &quot;Marburgvirus&quot; is derived from the city of Marburg in Hesse, West Germany (where Marburg virus was first discovered), and the taxonomic suffix &quot;-virus&quot; (which denotes a virus genus). Even though the virus was named after the city of Marburg, Dr. Ana Gligić, lead virologist at a laboratory in Belgrade, was first who managed to isolate the virus.

==Previous designations==
Until 1998, the family &quot;Filoviridae&quot; contained only one genus, &quot;Filovirus&quot;. Once it became clear that marburgviruses and ebolaviruses are fundamentally different, this genus was abolished and a genus &quot;Marburg-like viruses&quot; was established for marburgviruses. In 2002, the genus name was changed to &quot;Marburgvirus&quot;, and in 2010 and 2011 the genus was emended.

==Genus inclusion criteria==
A virus that fulfills the criteria for being a member of the family &quot;Filoviridae&quot; is a member of the genus &quot;Marburgvirus&quot; if
* its genome has one gene overlap
* its fourth gene (&quot;GP&quot;) encodes only one protein (GP1,2) and cotranscriptional editing is not necessary for its expression
* peak infectivity of its virions is association with particles ≈665 nm in length
* its genome differs from that of Marburg virus by &lt;50% at the nucleotide level
* its virions show almost no antigenic cross reactivity with ebolavirions

==Genus organization==
==&quot;Marburg marburgvirus&quot;==
The species was introduced in 1998 as &quot;Marburg virus&quot;.

Because of easy confusion with its virus member Marburg virus, the species name was changed to &quot;Lake Viktoria marburgvirus&quot; in 2005.

In 2010, it was proposed to change the name to &quot;Marburg marburgvirus&quot;, and this proposal was accepted in early 2012 by the ICTV.

&quot;Marburg marburgvirus&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Lake Victoria marburgvirus&quot;) is a virological taxon (i.e. a man-made concept) included in the genus &quot;Marburgvirus&quot;, family &quot;Filoviridae&quot;, order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. The species has two virus members, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV). The members of the species (i.e. the actual physical entities) are called Marburg marburgviruses. The name &quot;Marburg marburgvirus&quot; is derived from the city of Marburg in Hesse, West Germany (where Marburg virus was first discovered), and the taxonomic suffix &quot;marburgvirus&quot; (which denotes a marburgvirus species).

==Species inclusion criteria==
A virus that fulfills the criteria for being a member of the genus &quot;Marburgvirus&quot; is a member of the species &quot;Marburg marburgvirus&quot; if it has the properties of marburgviruses (because there is currently only marburgvirus species) and if its genome differs from that of Marburg virus (variant Musoke) by &lt;30% at the nucleotide level.

<text>Between the Buttons is the fifth British and seventh American studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 20 January 1967 in the UK and 10 February in the US. Reflecting the band&#x27;s brief foray into psychedelia and baroque pop balladry during the era, the album is among their most eclectic works; multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones frequently abandoned his guitar during the sessions in favour of instruments such as organ, marimba, dulcimer, vibraphone, kazoo, and theremin. Keyboard contributions came from two session players: former Rolling Stones member Ian Stewart (piano, organ) and frequent contributor Jack Nitzsche (piano, harpsichord). &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; would be the last album produced by Andrew Loog Oldham, who had, to this point, acted as the band&#x27;s manager and produced all of their albums.

As with prior albums, the American and British versions contained slightly different track listings. The American version of &quot;Between the Buttons&quot;, which includes &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; and &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, is on the 2003 and 2012 versions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; reached number 3 on the British album charts and number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart.

==Recording and background==
On the previous album, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, Brian Jones introduced a large number of different instruments to the recording sessions, a trend he continued on this album. Jones only contributed electric guitar on one track apiece on the American release and the British version. Bill Wyman plays bass on all except three tracks (which instead feature Richards on bass), and drummer Charlie Watts and lead singer Mick Jagger appear on all tracks. Piano duties were split by two session players: original Rolling Stones member Ian Stewart and frequent contributor Jack Nitzsche.

Early sessions for the album occurred between 3 August 1966 and the 11th at Los Angeles&#x27; RCA Studios during the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1966 American Tour. David Hassinger was the engineer for the album. Several songs were worked on; the backing tracks of six songs that would appear on the album were recorded, as were those of &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Driving Your Plane?&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?&quot;, released as a single in late September. During this time, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys was invited down to RCA Studios during the recording of &quot;My Obsession&quot;, which remains one of his favourite Rolling Stones songs.

The band returned to London, and sessions continued at IBC Studios from August 31 to September 3. &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?&quot; was completed and released on 23 September before the Stones embarked on their seventh British tour, which lasted into early October and was their last UK tour until 1971.

The second block of recording sessions for &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; began on 8 November at the newly opened Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes, London, alternating between Olympic and Pye Studios until 26 November. During this time, the bulk of the album was completed, including vocal and other overdubs on the previously recorded backing tracks and mixing. &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; was also completed.

Around the same time, producer Andrew Loog Oldham was also preparing the US-only live album &quot;Got Live If You Want It!&quot;, a contractual requirement from London Records that contained live performances from their recent British tour as well as studio tracks overdubbed with audience noise. After that album&#x27;s release on 10 December, a final overdubbing session for &quot;Buttons&quot; was held at Olympic Studios on 13 December 1966 before Oldham took the tapes back to RCA Studios in Hollywood for final mixing and editing.

The album was recorded using four-track machines, with tracks of the initial sessions mixed down in order to free the tracks for use as overdubs. Mick Jagger felt this process lost the clarity of the songs, commenting during an interview that &quot;we bounced it back to do overdubs so many times we lost the sound of it. [The songs] sounded so great, but later on, I was really disappointed with it.&quot; He commented further: &quot;I don&#x27;t know, it just isn&#x27;t any good. &#x27;Back Street Girl&#x27; is about the only one I like.&quot; In an interview with &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, he even called the rest of the album &quot;more or less rubbish.&quot;

&quot;Between the Buttons&quot; would be the last album wholly produced by Oldham, with whom the Stones fell out in mid-1967 during the recording sessions for &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;.

==Artwork==
The photoshoot for the album cover took place in November 1966 on Primrose Hill in North London. The photographer was Gered Mankowitz, who also shot the band photos for the cover of &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;. The shoot took place at 5:30 in the morning following an all-night recording session at Olympic Studios. Using a homemade camera filter constructed of black card, glass and Vaseline, Mankowitz created the effect of the Stones dissolving into their surroundings. The goal of the shoot was, in Mankowitz&#x27;s words, &quot;to capture the ethereal, druggy feel of the time; that feeling at the end of the night when dawn was breaking and they&#x27;d been up all night making music, stoned.&quot; 

The cover photo was shot at the Primrose Hill viewpoint in the misty early-morning sunlight, looking west. Brian Jones&#x27; dishevelled and gaunt appearance disturbed many of his fans, and critic David Dalton wrote that he looked &quot;like a doomed albino raccoon.&quot; &quot;Brian [Jones] was lurking in his collar&quot;, Mankowitz commented years later. &quot;I was frustrated because it felt like we were on the verge of something really special, and he was messing it up. But the way Brian appeared to not give a shit is exactly what the band was about.&quot; Outtakes from this photo session were later used for the cover and inner sleeves of the 1972 ABKCO compilation release &quot;More Hot Rocks (Big Hits &amp; Fazed Cookies)&quot;.

The back cover of &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; is dominated by a six-panel cartoon accompanied by a rhythmic poem drawn by drummer Charlie Watts. When Watts asked Oldham what the title of the album would be, he told him it was &quot;between the buttons&quot;, a name Jagger came up with after noticing the shiny buttons on Watt&#x27;s shirt. On the album cover itself, the band name and album title appear on the buttons on Watts&#x27; overcoat. Often difficult to see, this text was included blown up on a hype sticker affixed to original US pressings and would also be added to the bottom corners of the artwork for several CD and LP reissues.

== Marketing and sales ==
&quot;Between the Buttons&quot;, like many British long-players of the era, differed between its UK and US versions. The UK edition (in the form Oldham and the Stones intended it) was issued on 20 January 1967 (Mono, LK 4852; Stereo, SKL 4852) on Decca Records, concurrently with a separate single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; b/w &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;. As was common in the British record industry at the time, the single did not appear on the album. &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; reached number three in the UK. In the US, the album was released by London Records in early February 1967 (mono, LL 3499; stereo, PS 499). &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; and &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; were slotted onto the album while &quot;Back Street Girl&quot; and &quot;Please Go Home&quot; were removed (these would be included on the following US odds-and-ends release, &quot;Flowers&quot;, in June 1967). With &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; reaching number one, &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; shot to number two in the US, going gold.

In August 2002, both editions of &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; were reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records. Almost all reissues of the album since 1968 have been in stereo; in 2016, the album&#x27;s mono release was reissued on CD, vinyl, and digital download as part of &quot;The Rolling Stones in Mono&quot;. While most reissues have used the US track listing to maximise profit by featuring the two hit singles, the UK version was re-issued by ABKCO in 2003 on 180-gram vinyl in the US.

== Critical reception and legacy ==

&quot;Between the Buttons&quot; was called &quot;among the greatest rock albums&quot; by Robert Christgau, who later included it in his &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). He also wrote of the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;40 Essential Albums of 1967&quot;: &quot;[T]his underrated keeper is distinguished by complex rhymes, complex sexual stereotyping, and the non-blues, oh-so-rock-and-roll pianos of Ian Stewart, Jack Nitzsche, Nicky Hopkins, and Brian Jones.&quot; 

AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger hailed it as one of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;strongest, most eclectic LPs&quot;. In a retrospective review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne called the album &quot;a cheeky set of sardonic Swinging London vaudeville rock&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Christopher Walsh wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s brimming with overlooked gems, the band delivering a captivating blend of folky, Beatles-esque pop and tough bluesy rockers.&quot; 

Tom Moon wrote in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) that the album was &quot;lighter and thinner&quot; than &quot;Aftermath&quot; and, &quot;having belatedly discovered pop melody, Jagger and Richards were suddenly overdosing on the stuff.&quot; Music scholars Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon observed baroque pop and music hall on the album. Jim DeRogatis included &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; in his 2003 list of the essential psychedelic rock albums.

In 2003, the American version of &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; was ranked number 355 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, and re-ranked number 357 in 2012.

==Use in other media==

In a scene in Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, the character Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) plays &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; on a record player. She cues up the track &quot;She Smiled Sweetly&quot;, which is followed by &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;. (&quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; appears on the US release of the album, though it does not follow &quot;She Smiled Sweetly&quot; in the track order.)

<text>Century Radio was the brand name of a group of Independent Local Radio stations in England. The brand was developed with the launch of 100-102 Century Radio in North East England in 1994, with John Myers as managing director and John Simons as programme director. The brand grew when Myers launched 106 Century FM for the East Midlands, and further when 105.4 Century Radio was launched in North West England in 1998. Ocean FM used the Century format, but not the brand.

The group was initially owned by Border Radio Holdings until 2000, when Capital Radio Group took over the brand. When the larger GCap Media acquired the group in 2005, they were forced to sell the Nottingham-based &quot;106&quot; station to Chrysalis Group for competition reasons. GMG Radio, with Myers and Simons as senior executives, bought the stations in 2006. They were rebranded Real Radio to conform to the branding and network programming of the other stations in the Real Radio network that Myers had developed since in 2000.

The stations were very successful using their &#x27;radio you just have to sing along to&#x27; format, but later RAJAR figures showed a decline in market reach and market share.

The head offices were based at Salford Quays, along with the studios of Century&#x27;s north west station, 105.4 Century Radio. In addition, the building also accommodates GMG Radio&#x27;s sales division, and has completed building work to fit in sister station Smooth Radio and newly launched Rock Radio.

==History==

It was established by John Myers and John Simons of Border Radio Holdings, a subsidiary of Border Television. The brand was later expanded to two further stations in North West England and the East Midlands.

In 2000, ownership of the stations was transferred to Capital Radio Group, when Capital Radio Group bought Border Television. The buy-out was largely seen as Capital attempting to gain control of Century and its three regional licences, especially when Border Television itself was rapidly sold on to Granada Media Group.

Under the ownership of Capital the stations were subtly rebranded from &quot;Century Radio&quot; to &quot;Century FM&quot;. There was also a transfer away from the sixties, seventies, eighties, and nineties music format, which clashed with Capital&#x27;s Capital Gold brand to a more modern music format. The south-coast based Ocean FM also took the &quot;Century Format&quot; but did not take the Century brand name.

With the merger of Capital and GWR in 2005, the Century brand became part of GCap Media, however, the terms of the merger forced the sale of 106 Century FM to Chrysalis Group. Under the ownership of Chrysalis Group, 106 Century FM relaunched as Heart 106 at Midnight on Friday 26 August 2005. Later in 2005, Ocean FM also began to move away from the Century format dropping Century branding, straplines, and networked programming for a more individual approach.

Finally, on 18 October 2006, it was announced that the two remaining Century stations had been sold to GMG Radio. Perhaps ironically, GMG Radio was run by Myers and Simons who created the original Century brand in 1994.

In December 2006, Century Digital ceased broadcasting on Sky Digital channel 0113 and was replaced with theJazz.

Century Digital was replaced by Real Radio on DAB, a GMG Radio brand, in London on 23 March 2007, leaving Birmingham as the only area with Century Digital available, it finally closed a few days later. In 2008, Century FM changed its name to Century Radio and adopted a new logo, matching that of sister station Real Radio. On 31 March 2009, after over 14 years of using the Century name, Century Radio was renamed Real Radio to fit in with the branding and network programming of the other stations in the Real Radio network.

<text>Joel W. Gibb (born 28 January 1977) is a Berlin-based Canadian artist and singer-songwriter who leads the &quot;gay church folk&quot; group The Hidden Cameras. He was born in Kincardine, Ontario.

==Career==
His first involvement with the music scene was as editor of a fanzine devoted to independent bands, &quot;Glamour Guide for Trash&quot;. He also hosted a college radio show at CFRE-FM in Mississauga, Ontario. At the same time, he was writing his own songs and, in 2001, he released some of his recordings under the name The Hidden Cameras on his own independent record label EvilEvil, a CD entitled &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;.

He then gathered together a group of musicians to perform his work, playing everywhere from art galleries to churches to porn theatres to parks. Along the way, the band grew to include up to thirteen members, including a string section, choir and go-go dancers, its audience growing at the same time.

In 2003 the Hidden Cameras were signed to Rough Trade, a well-known British record label who released the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Smell of Our Own&quot; the same year. They began to tour North America and Europe extensively. In 2004, the album &quot;Mississauga Goddam&quot; was released, followed by &quot;The Arms of His &#x27;Ill&#x27;&quot; on the California label Absolutely Kosher Records. The album &quot;Awoo&quot; came out in 2006 on Rough Trade Records, EvilEvil and Arts &amp; Crafts, and the fifth studio album, &quot;&quot;, was released 22 September 2009 on the Arts &amp; Crafts label. All The Hidden Cameras releases to date have been produced by Joel Gibb. In 2007, solo recordings by Gibb were released on the tribute to Arthur Russell compilation EP, &quot;Four Songs by Arthur Russell&quot;. On 21 January 2014, &quot;Age&quot;, the sixth studio album by The Hidden Cameras, was released.

Gibb exhibits his artwork in various galleries and has been included in group shows in the past at the Tate Modern, among others. His work comprises drawings and banners, both of which are featured on The Hidden Cameras CDs and records. He also shows the videos he has directed for The Hidden Cameras. In 2007, Joel Gibb made his New York gallery debut at Sunday L.E.S. (now Horton Gallery).

In 2008, Joel Gibb made his acting debut, alongside Jena von Brücker, Mark Ewert, Calvin Johnson, Jen Smith, and Vaginal Davis, as one of the stars of the film &quot;The Lollipop Generation&quot;, directed by G.B. Jones. The film also features music by The Hidden Cameras.

Two of his song lyrics, &quot;He Is the Boss of Me&quot; and &quot;A Miracle&quot;, appear in John Barton and Billeh Nickerson&#x27;s 2007 anthology &quot;Seminal: The Anthology of Canada&#x27;s Gay Male Poets&quot;.

Gibb contributed to R.E.M.&#x27;s album &quot;Collapse into Now&quot;, with backing vocals on the track &quot;It Happened Today&quot;.

In 2012, Gibb provided guitar and harmony vocals on the Pet Shop Boys song &quot;In His Imagination&quot;.

Gibb currently lives in Berlin. At one point, Gibb lived in Mississauga, Ontario.

<doc id="956106" wikidata="Q5331908" url="?curid=956106" title="Ebolavirus">
<text>The genus Ebolavirus (- or ; - or ) is a virological taxon included in the family &quot;Filoviridae&quot; (filament-shaped viruses), order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. The members of this genus are called ebolaviruses, and encode their genome in the form of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. The six known virus species are named for the region where each was originally identified: &quot;Bundibugyo ebolavirus&quot;, &quot;Reston ebolavirus&quot;, &quot;Sudan ebolavirus&quot;, &quot;Taï Forest ebolavirus&quot; (originally &quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire ebolavirus&quot;), &quot;Zaire ebolavirus&quot;, and &quot;Bombali ebolavirus&quot;. The last is the most recent species to be named and was isolated from Angolan free-tailed bats in Sierra Leone. Each species of the genus &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; has one member virus, and four of these cause Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans, a type of hemorrhagic fever having a very high case fatality rate. The Reston virus has caused EVD in other primates. &quot;Zaire ebolavirus&quot; has the highest mortality rate of the ebolaviruses and is responsible for the largest number of outbreaks of the six known species of the genus, including the 1976 Zaire outbreak and the outbreak with the most deaths (2014).

Ebolaviruses were first described after outbreaks of EVD in southern Sudan in June 1976 and in Zaire in August 1976. The name &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; is derived from the Ebola River in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), near the location of the 1976 outbreak, and the taxonomic suffix &quot;-virus&quot; (denoting a viral genus). This genus was introduced in 1998 as the &quot;Ebola-like viruses&quot;. In 2002, the name was changed to &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; and in 2010, the genus was emended. Ebolaviruses are closely related to marburgviruses.

== Structure ==
Ebolavirus is a filamentous, enveloped virus within the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; which also contains rabies and measles viruses. This order is characterized by non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA (-ssRNA) genomes that are surrounded by a helical nucleocapsid. Filoviruses encode seven different proteins that include: NP (nucleoprotein), VP35 (part of the polymerase complex), VP40 (matrix protein), GP (glycoprotein spike), VP30 (transcription activator), VP42 (second matrix protein), and L (RdRp). Of these proteins, GP and NP proteins are crucial for viral entry and replication.

GP is the protein responsible for pathogenic differences among ebolaviruses. GP encodes two glycoproteins, one of which is sGP (soluble glycoprotein) which has a role in Ebola pathogenesis. Research has suggested that sGP is able to subvert the host immune response increasing the EBOV pathogenesis.

NP contains both the filoviral genome and the antigenome. NP oligomerization is responsible for the NC (helical nucleocapsid) formation which allows the -ssRNA genome to be protected against host cell degradation by endonucleases and host immune response. NP is also shown to recruit host cell proteins to facilitate virus transcription and replication within the cytoplasm.

==Hosts==
Researchers have found evidence of Ebola infection in three species of fruit bat. The bats show no symptoms of the disease, indicating that they may be the main natural reservoirs of the Ebolavirus. It is possible that there are other reservoirs and vectors. Understanding where the virus incubates between outbreaks and how it is transmitted between species will help protect humans and other primates from the virus.

The researchers found that bats of three species – Franquet&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Epomops franqueti&quot;), the hammer-headed bat (&quot;Hypsignathus monstrosus&quot;) and the little collared fruit bat (&quot;Myonycteris torquata&quot;) – had either genetic material from the Ebola virus, known as RNA sequences, or evidence of an immune response to the disease. The bats showed no symptoms themselves.

The Bombali ebolavirus (BOMV) was isolated from the little free-tailed bat (&quot;Chaerephon pumilus&quot;) and the Angolan free-tailed bat (&quot;Mops condylurus&quot;) in Sierra Leone.

==Entry pathway==
The entry pathway that the virus uses is a key step in its cycle. Several pathways have been suggested for Ebolavirus such as phagocytosis and clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis. However, Nanbo et al. (2010) and Saeed et al. (2010) independently proved that neither of these pathways is actually used.

They discovered that Ebolavirus uses macropinocytosis to enter the host cells. Induction of macropinocytosis leads to the formation of macropinocytosis-specific endosomes (macropinosomes), which are large enough to accommodate Ebola virions. This discovery was proven by the fact that Ebolavirus co-localizes with sorting nexin 5 (SNX5), which consists of a large family of peripheral membrane proteins that associate with newly formed macropinosomes. Also, blocking the macropinocytosis pathway has been proven to stop Ebolavirus from entering the cells. Four different macropinocytosis specific inhibitors were tested: cytochalasin D (depolymerizing agent), wortmannin (Wort), LY-294002 (both are inhibitors of PI3K) and EIPA (5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride), an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger specific for pinocytosis.

Then, internalized EBOV particles are transported to late endosomes and, there, co-localization with GTPase Rab7 (marker of late endosomes) is observed. Mutation of both Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases additionally inhibits viral entry. After trafficking to late endosomes, Ebola virus binds the intracellular receptor Neimann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and the viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane, allowing the virus to release its genome into the cytoplasm.

== Treatment ==
The main reason that there are not many available treatments is that Ebola is such a severe virus, with a 90% fatality rate. It can only be explored in a BSL-4 laboratory which is very selective. In order for it to be studied more widely, BSL-2 laboratories have been able to use systems that are substitutes for the actual infectious virus. Scientists have used pseudo types that have the same glycoprotein on the surface that is used for entry into the host cell. They also use noninfectious Ebola-like particles as a replacement system to study.

The search for a vaccine for Ebola began immediately after it was first discovered in 1976. There are currently only two FDA approved drugs. In October 2020 Immazab was officially approved and in December 2020, Ebanga was also officially approved. The difference between the two treatments is that Immazeb uses three monoclonal antibodies whereas Ebanga only has one monoclonal antibody. Both of these treatments are designed to attack the glycoprotein in order to prevent the virus from entering a new host cell and replicating. Besides these two drugs, there is more general treatment care such as managing symptoms that are caused by Ebola such as vomiting, fever, diarrhea, and any pain.

==Taxonomy notes==
According to the rules for taxon naming established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the name of the genus &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; is always to be capitalized, italicized, never abbreviated, and to be preceded by the word &quot;genus&quot;. The names of its members (ebolaviruses) are to be written in lower case, are not italicized, and used without articles.

==Genus inclusion criteria==
A virus of the family &quot;Filoviridae&quot; is a member of the genus &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; if
* its genome has several gene overlaps
* its fourth gene (&quot;GP&quot;) encodes four proteins (sGP, ssGP, Δ-peptide, and GP1,2) using cotranscriptional editing to express ssGP and GP1,2 and proteolytic cleavage to express sGP and Δ-peptide
* peak infectivity of its virions is associated with particles ≈805 nm in length
* its genome differs from that of Marburg virus by ≥50% and from that of Zaire ebolavirus by &lt;50% at the nucleotide level
* its virions show almost no antigenic cross reactivity with marburg virions

==Classification==

The genera &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; and &quot;Marburgvirus&quot; were originally classified as the species of the now-obsolete genus &quot;Filovirus&quot;. In March 1998, the Vertebrate Virus Subcommittee proposed in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to change the genus &quot;Filovirus&quot; to the family &quot;Filoviridae&quot; with two specific genera: &quot;Ebola-like viruses&quot; and &quot;Marburg-like viruses&quot;. This proposal was implemented in Washington, D.C., as of April 2001 and in Paris as of July 2002. In 2000, another proposal was made in Washington, D.C., to change the &quot;-like viruses&quot; to &quot;-virus&quot; resulting in today&#x27;s &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; and &quot;Marburgvirus&quot;.

Five characterised species of the genus &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; are:

;Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) : Also known simply as the &quot;Zaire virus&quot;, ZEBOV has the highest case-fatality rate, up to 90% in some epidemics, with an average case fatality rate of approximately 83% over 27 years. There have been more outbreaks of &quot;Zaire ebolavirus&quot; than of any other species. The first outbreak took place on 26 August 1976 in Yambuku. Mabalo Lokela, a 44‑year-old schoolteacher, became the first recorded case. The symptoms resembled malaria, and subsequent patients received quinine. Transmission has been attributed to reuse of unsterilized needles and close personal contact. The virus is responsible for the 2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak, the deadliest &quot;Filovirus&quot; outbreak to date.

; Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) : The Sudan ebolavirus, like ZEBOV, emerged in 1976; it was at first assumed to be identical with ZEBOV. SUDV is believed to have broken out first amongst cotton factory workers in Nzara, Sudan (now in South Sudan), in June 1976, with the first case reported as a worker exposed to a potential natural reservoir. Scientists tested local animals and insects in response to this; however, none tested positive for the virus. The carrier is still unknown. The lack of barrier nursing (or &quot;bedside isolation&quot;) facilitated the spread of the disease. The average fatality rates for SUDV were 53% in 1976, 65% in 1979, and 53% in 2000.

; Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) : This virus was discovered during an outbreak of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) in crab-eating macaques from Hazleton Laboratories (now Fortrea) in 1989. Since the initial outbreak in Reston, Virginia, it has since been found in nonhuman primates in Pennsylvania, Texas, and Siena, Italy. In each case, the affected animals had been imported from a facility in the Philippines, where the virus has also infected pigs. Despite its status as a Level‑4 organism and its apparent pathogenicity in monkeys, RESTV did not cause disease in exposed human laboratory workers.

; Taï Forest ebolavirus (TAFV): Formerly known as &quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire ebolavirus&quot;, it was first discovered among chimpanzees from the Tai Forest in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Africa, in 1994. Necropsies showed blood within the heart to be brown; no obvious marks were seen on the organs; and one necropsy displayed lungs filled with blood. Studies of tissues taken from the chimpanzees showed results similar to human cases during the 1976 Ebola outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan. As more dead chimpanzees were discovered, many tested positive for Ebola using molecular techniques. The source of the virus was believed to be the meat of infected western red colobus monkeys (&quot;Procolobus badius&quot;) upon which the chimpanzees preyed. One of the scientists performing the necropsies on the infected chimpanzees contracted Ebola. She developed symptoms similar to those of dengue fever approximately a week after the necropsy, and was transported to Switzerland for treatment. She was discharged from hospital after two weeks and had fully recovered six weeks after the infection.

; Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV): On November 24, 2007, the Uganda Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of Ebola in the Bundibugyo District. After confirmation of samples tested by the United States National Reference Laboratories and the CDC, the World Health Organization confirmed the presence of the new species. On 20 February 2008, the Uganda Ministry officially announced the end of the epidemic in Bundibugyo, with the last infected person discharged on 8 January 2008. An epidemiological study conducted by WHO and Uganda Ministry of Health scientists determined there were 116 confirmed and probable cases of the new Ebola species, and that the outbreak had a mortality rate of 34% (39 deaths).

==Evolution==
Rates of genetic change are 8*10−4 per site per year and are thus one fourth as fast as influenza A in humans. Extrapolating backwards, Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus probably diverged several thousand years ago. A study done in 1995 and 1996 found that the genes of Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus differed by about 55% at the nucleotide level, and at least 67% at the amino acid level. The same study found that the strains of Ebolavirus differed by about 37–41% across the nucleotide level and 34–43% across the amino acid level. The EBOV strain was found to have an almost 2% change in the nucleotide level from the original 1976 strain from the Yambuki outbreak and the strain from the 1995 Kikwit outbreak. However, paleoviruses of filoviruses found in mammals indicate that the family itself is at least tens of millions of years old.

==Genus organization and common names==

The genus &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; has been organized into six species; however, the nomenclature has proven somewhat controversial, with many authors continuing to use common names rather than species names when referring to these viruses. In particular, the generic term &quot;Ebola virus&quot; is widely used to refer specifically to members of the species &quot;Zaire ebolavirus&quot;. Consequently, in 2010, a group of researchers recommended that the name &quot;Ebola virus&quot; be adopted for a subclassification within the species &quot;Zaire ebolavirus&quot; and that similar common names be formally adopted for other &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; species. In 2011, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) rejected a proposal (2010.010bV) to formally recognize these names, as they do not designate names for subtypes, variants, strains, or other subspecies level groupings. As such, the widely used common names are not formally recognized as part of the taxonomic nomenclature. In particular, &quot;Ebola virus&quot; does not have an official meaning recognized by ICTV, and rather they continue to use and recommend only the species designation &quot;Zaire ebolavirus&quot;.

The threshold for putting isolates into different species is usually a difference of more than 30% at the nucleotide level, compared to the type strain. If a virus is in a given species but differs from the type strain by more than 10% at the nucleotide level, it is proposed that it be named as a new virus. , none of the &quot;Ebolavirus&quot; species contain members divergent enough to receive more than one &quot;virus&quot; designation.

== Research ==
A 2013 study isolated antibodies from fruit bats in Bangladesh, against Ebola Zaire and Reston viruses, thus identifying potential virus hosts and signs of the filoviruses in Asia.

A recent alignment-free analysis of Ebola virus genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of three short DNA sequences that appear nowhere in the human genome, suggesting that the identification of specific species sequences may prove to be useful for the development of both diagnosis and therapeutics.

<text>Retro Studios, Inc. is an American video game developer and subsidiary of Nintendo based in Austin, Texas. The studio is best known for its work on the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series and has contributed to several other Nintendo-developed projects, such as &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot;.

Retro was founded on September 21, 1998, as an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg, hoping to create games for the upcoming GameCube aiming at an older demographic. The company began work on four games, all of which were canceled once Retro focused their resources on &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, the first &quot;Metroid&quot; game developed outside Japan. The success of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; led Retro to work on three sequels and later to become involved with reviving the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series with &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot;.

==History==

===1998–2002: Founding and &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;===

Retro Studios was founded on September 21, 1998, as an alliance between Nintendo and industry veteran Jeff Spangenberg. Spangenberg subsequently launched the company from his home on October 1, using funds he generated with his previous ventures, including Iguana Entertainment. Nintendo saw an opportunity for the new studio to create games for the upcoming GameCube targeting an older demographic, in the same vein as Iguana Entertainment&#x27;s successful &quot;&quot; series for the Nintendo 64. Retro began with 4 key people in late 1998 and opened an office in Austin, Texas in early 1999 with a staff of 25 people, including several former Iguana employees. Despite not having access to GameCube development kits, the studio immediately began work on four projects for the GameCube: an action adventure game named &quot;MetaForce&quot;, a vehicular combat game with the working title &quot;Car Combat&quot; (also known as &quot;Thunder Rally&quot;), an American football simulator named &quot;NFL Retro Football&quot;, and role-playing game &quot;Raven Blade&quot;. By the time development began, the studio had already grown in size to 120 employees. The company continued to grow during production, eventually peaking at over 200 employees.

The working environment was chaotic, with development getting behind schedule, and Nintendo executives complaining on how the games turned out. In 2000, producer Shigeru Miyamoto visited the studio. He was disappointed by the games except for their demonstration of the &quot;MetaForce&quot; game engine, which led Miyamoto to suggest that Retro could use the engine to develop a new game in the &quot;Metroid&quot; series. Shortly before the 2000 Nintendo Space World conference, Nintendo granted Retro the license to create &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and Retro shifted all development resources from &quot;MetaForce&quot; to the new game.

Retro eventually canceled development of their other projects to focus solely on &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. In February 2001, the company ended development of both &quot;NFL Retro Football&quot; and &quot;Thunder Rally&quot;, laying off about 20 employees. Although Retro demonstrated &quot;Raven Blade&quot; at E3 in 2001, the development team was plagued by technical setbacks. In July 2001, Retro canceled the project, retaining only nine team members to work on &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. Notably, artist Android Jones served as lead concept artist on the development of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;.

On May 2, 2002, Nintendo secured $1 million worth of Retro Studios stock from Spangenberg, and reclassified the company as a first party developer and division of Nintendo. Steve Barcia, the founder of Simtex, replaced Spangenberg as president of the company.

During the final nine months of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;&#x27;s development, Retro&#x27;s staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach their final milestone. Despite its troubled production cycle and initial skepticism from fans, the game was released on November 17, 2002, in North America to universal critical acclaim and commercial success, selling over two million units worldwide.

===2003–2009: The &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; trilogy===

After the critical and commercial success of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, Nintendo asked Retro Studios to produce a sequel. The developers decided against recycling the features of the first game while creating &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot;, and instead used new sound models, weapon effects, and art designs. A multiplayer component was also added to the game. In April 2003, Steve Barcia left the company. Michael Kelbaugh, who had worked with Nintendo for over 15 years, was appointed president, a job he retains to this date. Retro tried to include some extras, such as a hidden version of &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, but were halted by the short development time. Producer Kensuke Tanabe later revealed in an interview that the game was just about thirty percent complete three months before the strict deadline Nintendo had set for a release in the 2004 holiday season. The critical reception for &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot; was very positive, but earned some criticism on the game&#x27;s high difficulty. Sales for &quot;Echoes&quot; were lower than the first &quot;Prime&quot;, with a total of 800,000 units.

Retro Studios was then put to produce the next game in the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; series, &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot;. Retro intended to give &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; larger environments than &quot;Echoes&quot;. The developers were also interested in using the WiiConnect24 feature to provide additional content for the game that would be accessible from the Internet. Retro announced that &quot;Corruption&quot; would be the final chapter of the &quot;Prime&quot; series and would have a plot &quot;about closure, told against the backdrop of an epic struggle&quot;. After the Wii Remote was revealed, Nintendo demonstrated how &quot;Metroid Prime 3&quot; would take advantage of the controller&#x27;s special abilities with a version of &quot;Echoes&quot; modified for the Wii and shown at the Tokyo Game Show in 2005. Originally envisioned as a launch game for the Wii in November 2006, &quot;Corruption&quot; suffered many delays, but eventually being released in August 2007 generally positive reviews, and over 1.60 million copies sold worldwide.

While Retro was busy with the &quot;Prime&quot; sequels, they had to pass on the Nintendo DS game &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot;. The eventual developer, Nintendo Software Technology (NST), worked closely with Retro to design the game&#x27;s art and characters to make sure that they fit into the overall Metroid series.

===2010–present: &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series, &quot;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&quot;, and other projects===
In April 2008, Retro saw the departure of three key developers, designer Mark Pacini, art director Todd Keller, and principal technology engineer Jack Mathews, who went on to form their own company, Armature Studio. Around the same time, Shigeru Miyamoto asked fellow producer Kensuke Tanabe to recommend a studio that could develop a new &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game, and Tanabe recommended Retro. Kelbaugh had worked on the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series during his years at Nintendo of America, and had interest in continuing with the franchise. Retro accepted the task, and thus started development of &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot;. Similar to &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;, the game was developed with the intention to invoke nostalgic feelings in the player with its art style and sound, while trying to provide them with new gameplay experiences. &quot;Returns&quot; employs fully polygonal 3D graphics with three times the amount of textures and polygons that &quot;Corruption&quot; offered, and over the course of six months, two thirds of the game&#x27;s tools and engine had to be rewritten by the programmers. Development accelerated at the outset of 2010, and the project was just &quot;beginning to cohere as a game&quot; around the time of E3, when it was officially announced to the press. Although the game was set for release in autumn that year, the team still had 70 levels to create or refine.

At E3 2011, it was announced during Nintendo&#x27;s Developer Roundtable that Retro Studios would be involved in the development of &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot; for Nintendo 3DS. At first, Retro would contribute assets to developing one of the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;-themed levels, but the number evolved to the stage design of sixteen tracks in the late stages of development, as the Nintendo EAD crew started working on other projects and the game would not be finished before the December 2011 deadline.

In 2012, it was revealed that Retro Studios had received a Wii U development kit, and was reportedly working on a Wii U game. Miyamoto has said he would like to work with Retro Studios in an installment for &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;; however, he says that the current game Retro Studios was working on is not related to &quot;Zelda&quot;. At E3 2012, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé told IGN in an interview that Retro is currently &quot;hard at work&quot; on an untitled project for the Wii U.

On February 28, 2014, Kensuke Tanabe announced that Retro Studios was working on a new game, which CEO Michael Kelbaugh declared had been in development for a few months since &quot;Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze&quot; was finished. In August 2015 however, during an interview about &quot;Metroid Prime: Federation Force&quot;, Tanabe said that he was not quite sure about what Retro Studios was working on, leaving the impression that he was no longer involved with their unannounced project.

Nintendo announced &quot;Metroid Prime 4&quot; at E3 2017, showing only the logo. Shortly after the announcement, Bill Trinen, Director of Product Marketing at Nintendo of America, confirmed that &quot;Prime 4&quot; would not be developed by Retro Studios, the studio that developed the previous &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; games, but would be produced by Kensuke Tanabe, the producer of the previous games. In 2018, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; reported that &quot;Prime 4&quot; was being developed by Bandai Namco Studios in Singapore. However, in a video released on January 25, 2019, Nintendo EPD general manager Shinya Takahashi announced that &quot;Metroid Prime 4&quot; had been delayed, and that development had been restarted with Retro Studios. Takahashi said that development under the previous studio had not met Nintendo&#x27;s standards. Nintendo&#x27;s shares fell by 2.8 percent in the week following the announcement.

<text>Heart North East is a regional radio station owned and operated by Global as part of the Heart network. It broadcasts to North East England.

==History==
===Century Radio===
Century Radio was the first regional station for North East England and also was the first to use the Century brand, which followed a &#x27;personality&#x27; format, mixing speech and music. The station was originally based beside the Tyne Bridge in Gateshead, before relocating to Team Valley in 2008 to share a building with fellow GMG Radio stations, Smooth Radio and Rock Radio. The station was originally called Century Radio, before changing its name to Century FM then reverting to the original name in 2008.

The station was set up by Border Television, with John Myers as managing director and John Simons as programme director. Myers presented the breakfast show under the pseudonym of John Morgan. The first song played on air was &quot;A Star is Born&quot;.

A &#x27;listener&#x27;s club&#x27; was formed, with parties at locations around the region attended by the station&#x27;s presenters. The Jingling Gate in Stanley, County Durham was the most common location, but other events were held at the Stadium of Light and the Dolphin Centre in Darlington.

Late-night phone-in presenter Mike &#x27;The Mouth&#x27; Elliott once caused controversy by walking out during his show. Elliot took an extended break after this controversy, during which time he appeared in the film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; as boxing coach George Watson. He was also fired in January 2000 when bosses claimed that he was intoxicated on air. However, Elliott claims that he was &quot;stoned out of his tree&quot; on Benylin while trying to fight off a heavy cold. He was reemployed when Capital Radio took over the station.

Ex-Metro Radio presenter Steve Colman&#x27;s highly marketed introduction to the breakfast show was very unpopular, and he was sacked after just three weeks in August 1996. It was revealed that audiences had decreased rapidly, and businesses had threatened to pull their advertising. Colman later joined Smooth North East.

Jeff Stephenson replaced Myers as managing director, and John Caine replaced Simons. Simons left the station for Talksport, and Myers left Gateshead to concentrate on setting up 105.4 Century FM in Salford and relaunching 106 Century FM in Nottingham.

Border sold the Century brand to GCap Media, and Myers left the group to head GMG Radio, where he set up the similar Real Radio network. Simons rejoined Myers to establish the Real and Smooth FM regional stations. In October 2006 GMG Radio acquired the Century brand from GCap.Wayback Machine Paul Smith, a former BBC and commercial radio producer, then joined Century as Programme Controller, and Sales Director Debbie Bowman was promoted to managing director. Smith left the company after the current Programme Director Kevin Howard joined the company in September 2007.

===Real Radio===
On 18 December 2008 it was announced that Century Radio would be re-branded as Real Radio from 30 March 2009.

The station has previously broadcast extensively on football, a passion in the north east, and had a particularly close relationship with both Newcastle United and Middlesbrough. The station began its association with the game with the 1994 launch of &#x27;The Big Mal Football Phone-In&#x27; hosted by Teesside presenter Dave Roberts and ex-manager Malcolm Allison. The station then signed an exclusive radio rights deal with Middlesbrough FC with Roberts and Allison joined by local BBC broadcaster Ali Brownlee and the resultant &#x27;Roberts &amp; Brownlee Show&#x27; was born.

Two famous ex-players for local sides, Malcolm Macdonald, who played for Newcastle United and Bernie Slaven, who played for Middlesbrough, presented the &quot;Legends Football Phone-In&quot; on weekday evenings, alongside ex-Sunderland player Eric Gates, and latterly, FA Cup Final 1973 winner Micky Horswill. Live match commentaries on Newcastle United and Sunderland matches aired until the end of the 2010–11 season. The &quot;Legends Football Phone In&quot; was dropped following the end of the 2011–12 season. The phone-in later moved to Star Radio North East and several community radio stations but was axed within a year.

===Heart===
On 25 June 2012, it was announced Global (the owner of stations such as Capital and Heart) had bought GMG Radio. The former GMG stations, including Real Radio, were placed under a hold separate company known as Real and Smooth Limited.

As of 5 November 2012, the station&#x27;s local programming consisted of a daily breakfast and weekday drivetime shows from Newcastle upon Tyne with most non-peak output broadcast from Salford Quays.

On 6 February 2014, Global announced it would be rebranding all Real Radio stations as Heart. Real Radio North East began a gradual transition to the Heart branding on 24 March 2014. The Real Radio branding was phased out a month later ahead of a full relaunch as Heart North East on 6 May 2014. Around the time of the rebrand, the station&#x27;s audience share was 3.8% (as of June 2014).

Gary Philipson and Lisa Shaw presented their final breakfast show in December 2014 after almost five years at the station. Justin Lockwood and Kelly Scott were promoted from the drivetime show and replaced the duo. Heart Gloucestershire presenter Tom Campbell joined inturn to takeover from Lockwood and Scott.

In May 2015, Heart North East moved to new studios at new studios at Wellbar Central in Newcastle city centre, shared with sister station Capital North East and Communicorp-owned Smooth North East.

In February 2019, following OFCOM&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Global announced it would replace Heart North East&#x27;s local breakfast and weekend shows with networked programming from London.

Breakfast presenters Justin Lockwood and Kelly Scott, alongside drivetime presenter Tom Campbell left the station in May 2019, with the latter joining wrestling-centric YouTube channel Cultaholic.

From 3 June 2019, the station&#x27;s regional output consisted of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside regional news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

As of 24 February 2025 all programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;Heart Drive&quot;, presented each weekday by JK and Kelly Brook.

<text>The Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps is a corps in the British Army responsible for many of its general administrative services, named for the Adjutant-General to the Forces (now the Commander Home Command). As of 2002, the AGC had a staff of 7,000 people.

==History==
The corps was formed on 6 April 1992 through the amalgamation of several separate services:

* Army Legal Corps
* Corps of Royal Military Police
* Military Provost Staff Corps
* Royal Army Educational Corps
* Royal Army Pay Corps
* Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps
* Staff clerks from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps
* Clerks from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.

In October 2022, to celebrate the Corps&#x27; 30th anniversary, a parade was held in Winchester, in the presence of The Duchess of Gloucester, Deputy Colonel in Chief.

== Organisation ==
The AGC is organised into the following branches:

===Staff &amp; Personnel Support (SPS) Branch===
The SPS branch provides specialist HR, Finance, Accounting and ICT support to the British Army, during peacetime and on operations. Its personnel serve alongside and administer every unit in the British Army. The branch also provides clerical support to headquarters at all levels including various departments of the MOD Head Office in Whitehall and the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) at Northwood working alongside counterparts in the Royal Navy and RAF, as well as in divisional and brigade headquarters and at unit and sub-unit level through Land Forces. In addition to HR, administrative and clerical support, the SPS Branch also maintains the Army Welfare Service, where its small cohort of Army Welfare Workers - trained social and occupational welfare specialists - provide therapeutic support to Army personnel and their families.

In 2011, Gurkha clerks and administrative personnel who, up to that point, had served under the Royal Gurkha Rifles cap badge, were brought into a single unit titled the Gurkha Staff and Personnel Support Company (GSPS Coy). Following the traditions of the Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Engineers, Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Signals and the Queen&#x27;s Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment, the GSPS Coy has a cap badge that combines elements of both its parent corps (the AGC) and the Brigade of Gurkhas, of which it is a constituent alongside the other Gurkha units in the British Army.

===Provost (AGC Pro) Branch===
The AGC Pro unifies two former services which, while no longer independent, retain their identities and cap badges. The Royal Military Police (RMP) is the Army&#x27;s police force, while the Military Provost Staff (MPS) provides guards for military prisons. The newly formed Military Provost Guard Service (MPGS) is also part of this branch.

===Educational and Training Services Branch===
The ETS Branch has the responsibilities of the former Royal Army Educational Corps, it is an all officer branch with around 400 serving members. In 2006 the former RAEC cap badge of a &#x27;fluted flambeau with five flames, with crown and scroll&#x27; was reintroduced, with &#x27;ETS&#x27; replacing &#x27;R.A.E.C.&#x27; on the scroll.

===Army Legal Services===
The ALS Branch provides legal advice to all levels of the Army. It retains the cap badge of the former Army Legal Corps. Prior to its amalgamation into the AGC, it was an independent corps in its own right. Its personnel are all qualified lawyers and commissioned officers.

=== CRHQ ===
Almost all corps of the British Army contain a CRHQ (Central Reserve Headquarters) which oversee training for the corps along with controlling specialist units and formations. The Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps currently maintains two specialist pools:

* CRHQ Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps Educational Training and Services Specialist Pool
* CRHQ Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps Staff and Personnel Support Specialist Pool

==Museum of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps==
The Museum of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps is based at Peninsula Barracks in Winchester. It is one of several regimental museums that are part of Winchester&#x27;s Military Museums.

<doc id="956124" wikidata="Q3421611" url="?curid=956124" title="Heart North West">
<text>Heart North West is a regional radio station owned and operated by Global as part of the Heart network. It broadcasts to North West England.

== Overview ==

===Century Radio (1998–2009)===
The station opened as Century Radio on 8 September 1998 as the second Century station in the country (the first being Gateshead-based 100-102 Century Radio). Owned and operated by Border Television, Century was founded by managing director John Myers, who had also established the north east station four years earlier. Like the first station, Myers also presented the breakfast show under the pseudonym John Morgan.

The station&#x27;s launch was the subject of an episode of a BBC Two fly-on-the-wall documentary &quot;Trouble at the Top,&quot; mainly following Myers. The episode, entitled &quot;Degsy Rides Again&quot;, showed Myers&#x27; attempts to train lunchtime phone-in host Derek Hatton, a controversial local ex-politician who had never before presented on radio. Myers was not confident enough in Hatton for him to appear on pre-launch publicity, although his show &quot;The Degsy Debate&quot; performed well at the first RAJAR. Also amongst its launch presenters was controversial shock jock Scottie McClue.

The documentary also covered the station&#x27;s acquisition of exclusive commentary rights for Manchester United F.C.&#x27;s games. They remained United&#x27;s official radio partner for almost a decade until selling the rights to Xfm Manchester for the 2007–08 season.

Myers left the group to head GMG Radio, overseeing the launch of the similar Real Radio brand. Capital Radio bought the Century network, and was subsequently acquired by GCap Media. GMG Radio acquired the Century stations in October 2006, reuniting Myers and John Simons (programme director on the original Gateshead station) with the brand.

===Real Radio (2009–2014)===
Century was re-branded as Real Radio on Monday 30 March 2009.

On 15 October 2012, Real Radio announced the station would increase its amount of networked programming. Weekday daytime shows, from 10am to 4pm and presented by Darren Parks and Debbie Mac, were networked across all Real Radio stations on Monday 5 November 2012 with further networked shows introduced at the weekend.

===Heart (2014–)===
On 25 June 2012 it was announced Global (the owner of stations such as Capital and Heart) had bought GMG Radio. The former GMG stations, including Real Radio, continued to operate separately as &#x27;Real and Smooth Limited&#x27; until 1 April 2014.

On 6 February 2014, Global announced it would be rebranding all Real Radio stations as Heart. Real Radio North West began a gradual transition to the Heart branding on 24 March 2014 and phased out the Real Radio branding on Sunday 20 April 2014. On 1 May 2014, local programming moved from Laser House in Salford to nearby Exchange Quay, sharing facilities with sister stations Capital Manchester and XFM Manchester. The full relaunch as Heart North West took place at 6am on Tuesday 6 May 2014.

On 12 June 2017, local programming moved from Salford to new studios at the XYZ building in the Spinningfields district of Manchester City Centre. Heart North West shares facilities with its sister station Capital Manchester and Lancashire and two Communicorp-owned stations, Smooth North West and Radio X 90s.

====Consolidation====
On 26 February 2019, Global announced sister station Heart North Lancashire &amp; Cumbria would close and merge with Heart North West.

On 3 June 2019, following further deregulation, local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London. Regional output was reduced to a three-hour drivetime show on weekdays, plus localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

All four of Heart North West&#x27;s presenters, including breakfast presenters Joel Ross and Lorna Bancroft and weekend presenter Faye Bamford, left the station.

====End of regional programming====
As of 24 February 2025 all programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;Heart Drive&quot;, presented each weekday by JK and Kelly Brook.

==News==
Global&#x27;s Manchester hub broadcasts hourly localised news bulletins from 0600–1900 on weekdays and from 0600–1200 at weekends, with headlines on the half hour during breakfast and drivetime shows.

Separate bulletins are produced for the North West of England and the licence area previously served by Heart North Lancashire &amp; Cumbria.

* Rich Clarke (now at Heart South)

<doc id="956126" wikidata="Q5593800" url="?curid=956126" title="Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance was an honor presented to female recording artists at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 and the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 for quality rap solo performances. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

In 1991, the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Best Rap Solo Performance category. In 2003, the category was split into two to recognize Female and Male Rap Solo Performances. The categories remained separated by gender until 2005 when they were combined into the genderless category originally called Best Rap Solo Performance. American artist Missy Elliott won the award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance both years it was presented.

==Background==
In 1991, the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance category. The category name remained unchanged until 2004 when it was split into separate categories for Female and Male Rap Solo Performance. The categories remained separated by gender for one additional year. In 2005, they were merged into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance. Female rapper MC Lyte has campaigned for the reinstatement of the female-specific category and believes that: &quot;it destroys [hip-hop] culture to not have the perspective of a woman&quot;. Bill Freimuth, Recording Academy Vice President of Awards, claimed that the category was eliminated because &quot;[there] wasn&#x27;t enough competition essentially, due to the lack of the number of releases in that category&quot;. Black Entertainment Television (BET) executive Stephen Hill cited a similar reason for the elimination of the female categories by the BET Hip Hop Awards and VH1&#x27;s Hip Hop Honors, reflecting a lack of female representation in the hip hop music scene for several years. As of 2011, the category name has not changed since 2005.

==Recipients==
For the 45th Grammy Awards (2003), Best Female Rap Solo Performance nominees included: Charli Baltimore for &quot;Diary...&quot;, Missy Elliott for &quot;Scream a.k.a. Itchin&#x27;&quot;, Eve for &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, Foxy Brown for &quot;Na Na Be Like&quot;, and Lauryn Hill for &quot;Mystery of Iniquity&quot;. Baltimore was shocked when she learned of her album&#x27;s nomination because she thought that it did not meet eligibility requirements. Elliott was also nominated for Best Short Form Music Video, along with Knoc-turn&#x27;al and Dr. Dre, for &quot;Knoc&quot;. The award was presented to Elliott at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though not broadcast on television.

Nominees for the 46th Grammy Awards included: Da Brat for &quot;Got It Poppin&#x27;&quot;, Elliott for &quot;Work It&quot;, Lil&#x27; Kim for &quot;Came Back for You&quot;, MC Lyte for &quot;Ride Wit Me&quot;, and Queen Latifah for &quot;Go Head&quot;. In addition, Elliott was nominated for: Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for &quot;Under Construction&quot;, Best Song Rap for &quot;Work It&quot;, and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Gossip Folks&quot; (featuring Ludacris), for a total five nominations. Lil&#x27; Kim was also nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Down&quot; (with Christina Aguilera) and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Magic Stick&quot; (featuring 50 Cent). The award was presented to Elliott for &quot;Work It&quot;, whose music video was awarded Video of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards.

Elliott won the award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance both years it was presented. Prior to the female and male categories, she received the award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 2002 for &quot;Get Ur Freak On&quot;. This marked the second time a female had received the award for Best Rap Solo Performance (Queen Latifah was presented the honor for &quot;U.N.I.T.Y.&quot; at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995). In 2007, following the return to the genderless category, Elliot was nominated for the song &quot;We Run This&quot;.
