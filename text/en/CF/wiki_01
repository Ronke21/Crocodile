<text>George Bull (25 March 1634 – 17 February 1710) was an English theologian and Bishop of St David&#x27;s.

==Life==
He was born, 25 March 1634, in the parish of St Cuthbert, Wells, and educated in the grammar school at Wells, and then at Blundell&#x27;s School in Tiverton under Samuel Butler. Before he was fourteen years old he went into residence at Exeter College, Oxford, where he became a friend of Thomas Clifford. In 1649, his tutor Baldwin Ackland refused to take the engagement, and together they left the university and settled at North Cadbury in Somerset.

He then studied under William Thomas, rector of Ubley and a puritan divine; Bull, however, was more influenced by his son Samuel Thomas, who directed Bull to read Richard Hooker, Henry Hammond, and Jeremy Taylor. On leaving Thomas, Bull applied to Robert Skinner, the ejected bishop of Oxford, for episcopal ordination, and was ordained by him deacon and priest the same day, aged 21. After his ordination he took the small living of St George&#x27;s, near Bristol. Bull, like Robert Sanderson and others, used the church prayers, which he knew by heart, without the book. He used to spend two months every year at Oxford and on his way there and back he visited Sir William Master of Abbey House, Cirencester. He met in this way the rector Alexander Gregory, whose daughter Bridget he married on Ascension Day, 1658. William Master performed the ceremony of marriage according to the form prescribed in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, although that usage was forbidden under penalty at the time. In the same year he was presented to the rectory of Siddington St Mary&#x27;s, near Cirencester, through the influence of Lady Pool, the lady of the manor. In 1659 the rectory at Siddington became one of the many places of meeting at which the friends of the exiled dynasty assembled to concert measures for the Restoration of Charles II of England.

In 1662 he was presented to the vicarage of Siddington St Peter&#x27;s by Lord Clarendon, at the request of William Nicholson, bishop of Gloucester. This was a contiguous parish, and he held it with Siddington St Mary&#x27;s; the two villages together did not contain more than thirty families. Bull was rector of Siddington for twenty-seven years, and encountered opposition from dissenting parishioners. After the publication of the &quot;Defensio&quot; (1685), dedicated to Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham who had presented him in 1678 to a prebend at Gloucester, Bull was given the rectory of Avening. In 1686 he was appointed by Archbishop William Sancroft to the archdeaconry of Llandaff; and John Fell managed him the degree of D.D. at Oxford, though he had never taken any previous degree.

After the 1688 Glorious Revolution he was placed on the commission of peace, and continued to act as a magistrate until he was made a bishop, in connection with the Society for the Reformation of Manners. In March 1705 Bull was appointed bishop of St David&#x27;s, but he was aged and infirm. He started to tour his diocese, but illness detained him at Brecknock, where he resided: his son-in-law, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Powell went as his commissioners, and during the whole period he was failing. He died 17 February 1710, and was buried at Brecknock. His life was written by Robert Nelson.

== Theology ==
Bull has a high place among Anglican theologians, and as a defender of the doctrine of the Trinity was held in high esteem even by Roman Catholic controversialists in Europe. 

He had an Arminian theology. He adopted an anti-Calvinist stance both in &quot;Defensio&quot; and &quot;Harmonia Apostolica&quot;.

==Works==
He wrote four major theological treatises in Latin, one on justification and three on the Trinity. The Latin works were collected and edited by John Ernest Grabe in 1703, with a preface and annotations by the editor, in one volume folio. These works have been translated into English at various times. A translation of the &quot;Harmonia Apostolica&quot; was made by Thomas Wilkinson of Great Houghton in 1801. The &quot;Harmonia&quot;, &quot;Examen Censurae&quot;, &quot;Defensio&quot;, and &quot;Judicium&quot; formed part of the &quot;Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology&quot; published at Oxford 1842-55. The &quot;Opinion of the Catholic Church&quot;, a translation of the &quot;Judicium&quot;, was published with a memoir of Bull&#x27;s life by Thomas Rankin in 1825, and a full edition of all the works of Bull (including the sermons and Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;) revised by Edward Burton was published, in seven volumes, at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in 1827.

===The &quot;Harmonia Apostolica&quot;===
He wrote his first book, the &quot;Harmonia Apostolica&quot;, in an attempt to reconcile the apparent discrepancies between St Paul and the &quot;Epistle of James&quot; on the relationship of faith and good works in Christian justification. He advocated the principle that Paul the Apostle ought to be interpreted by St James, not St James by St Paul, on the ground that St James wrote later, and was presumed acquainted with St Paul&#x27;s teaching. Bishop George Morley wrote a pastoral letter to his clergy against Bull; Thomas Barlow lectured against him at Oxford; Thomas Tully wrote an answer, in which he is said to have been assisted by Morley and Barlow; Charles Gataker, son of Thomas Gataker, Thomas Truman and John Toombes, nonconformists, also wrote against him. The &quot;Harmonia Apostolica&quot; was published in 1669-70, and his &quot;Examen Censures&quot; (his reply to Gataker), and his &quot;Apologia pro Harmonia&quot; (his reply to Barlow) in 1675.

===The &quot;Defensio&quot;===
His advocacy of the necessity of good works caused his adversaries to insinuate that he was a Socinian. His move onto the polemical ground of trinitarianism was therefore prompted by the need to clarify his position, in &quot;Defensio Fidei Nicaenae&quot; (1685). It was finished in 1680, but was turned down by three publishers. It appeared with the backing of William Jane, and John Fell who subsidised the cost of publication. It was stylish and well received, with praise from Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet. The context was that Petavius and Simon Episcopius, to take two examples, denied that the ante-Nicene Church Fathers held the same doctrines as those which were established at the Council of Nicaea. Bull took upon himself to prove that they did, and concentrated on the opinions of the ante-Nicene fathers, excluding other controversies.

A substantial excerpt from the &quot;Defensio Fidei Nicaenae&quot; was reprinted by Abbé Migne in his seventh volume devoted to Origen in the &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot; (vol. XVII)

===Further trinitarian works===
Bull&#x27;s next work, the &quot;Judicium Ecclesiae Catholicae&quot; (1694), supplements the &quot;Defensio&quot;. Episcopius held that the Nicene fathers did not consider a belief in our Lord&#x27;s true and proper divinity as an indispensable term of catholic communion; Bull wrote the &quot;Judicium&quot; to prove that they did. His last work on the trinitarian question, entitled &quot;Primitiva et Apostolica Traditio&quot;, was directed against the opinion of Daniel Zwicker, that Christ&#x27;s divinity, preexistence, and incarnation were inventions of early heretics.

===Other works===
He wrote also &quot;Corruptions of the Church of Rome&quot;. Robert Nelson, Bull&#x27;s pupil and biographer, had sent Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet a copy of the &quot;Judicium&quot;. Bossuet was pleased with this work also, and Bull had congratulations from the clergy of France for defending the divinity of Christ. The &quot;Corruptions&quot; was Bull&#x27;s reply to Bossuet&#x27;s wondering aloud why Bull was not a Catholic. It reached a fourth edition in 1714, and was translated into Italian. &quot;A Companion to Candidates for Orders, or the Great Importance of the Priestly Office&quot; was published after his death, in 1714. His son Robert published his sermons after his death, twenty in number.

<text>The S3 ViRGE (Video and Rendering Graphics Engine) graphics chipset was one of the first 2D/3D accelerators designed for the mass market.

Introduced in 1996 by then graphics powerhouse S3, Inc., the ViRGE was S3&#x27;s first foray into 3D-graphics. The S3/Virge was the successor to the successful Trio64V+. ViRGE/325 was pin compatible with the Trio64 chip, retaining the DRAM-framebuffer interface (up to 4MB), and clocking both the core and memory up to 80 MHz. In Windows, Virge was benchmarked as the fastest DRAM-based accelerator of the era. The VRAM-based version, ViRGE/VX, was actually slower in lower resolutions, but had a faster RAMDAC to support high-resolution modes not available on the 325.

==Support==
Part of S3&#x27;s marketing plan for the ViRGE included the &quot;S3D&quot; standard, stating that members of the ViRGE family carried the &quot;S3D Graphics Engine&quot;. Games that supported ViRGE directly put this logo on their box so owners of the 3D card would know that it would run as well as possible on their computer. And, despite its lackluster 3D-speed, the ViRGE did receive some &quot;S3D&quot; enhanced games, due in large part to the brand prestige S3 carried in this period. Some examples of the ViRGE-enhanced versions were: &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot;, &quot;Descent II&quot;, &quot;Monster Truck Madness&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider,&quot; &quot;MechWarrior 2&quot;, &quot;FX Fighter Turbo&quot;, &quot;Terracide&quot;, &quot;POD&quot;, &quot;Incoming&quot;, and &quot;Jedi Knight&quot;.

==Performance==

With the successful launch of the Sony PlayStation home game-console, pressure was on the PC market to incorporate hardware that could compete in the area of realtime 3D graphics rendering, something that software-based host-CPU rendering could not do well on its own. That is, main-CPU software-based rendering could render realtime 3D graphics—as demonstrated by games like &quot;Descent&quot;, which used only the main CPU and standard VGA hardware to render full-screen 3D video with 6-degrees-of-freedom motion in real time—but the resolution, polygon count, and quality of shading, smoothing, etc. were not competitive with dedicated 3D rendering hardware. While the market demand was clearly present, realtime 3D graphics rendering was new and unfamiliar territory for S3 and many of its hardware competitors. With a sizable chunk of ViRGE&#x27;s hardware real-estate already devoted to other key functions (such as the VGA-controller, 2D/BITBLT engine, RAMDAC, PCI and memory interface), and the need to serve traditional 2D applications, the resulting 3D functionality was both limited and slow.

When performing basic 3D-rendering with only texture mapping and no other advanced features, ViRGE&#x27;s pixel throughput was somewhat faster than the best software-optimized (host-based CPU) 3D-rendering of the era, and with better (16bpp) color fidelity. But when additional rendering operations were added to the polygon load (such as perspective-correction, Z-depth fogging, and bilinear filtering), rendering throughput dropped to the speed of software-based rendering on an entry-level CPU. 3D-rendering on the high-end VRAM based ViRGE/VX (988) was even slower than the less expensive ViRGE/325, due to the VX&#x27;s slower core and memory clock rates. The upgraded ViRGE/DX and ViRGE/GX models did improve 3D rendering performance, but by the time of their introduction they were still unable to distinguish the ViRGE family in an already crowded 3D market.

Outside of 3D rendering, ViRGE was a solid performer in familiar tasks as DOS VGA and Microsoft Windows. Here, S3&#x27;s substantial experience in high-performance Windows acceleration showed, with ViRGE benchmarking near the top among competing DRAM-based VGA cards. In OEM PC markets, ViRGE sold well as a direct replacement to S3&#x27;s highly successful Trio/64 family. The ViRGE family delivered faster Windows acceleration in the same physical footprint as its predecessor.

The introduction of competing hardware, 3dfx&#x27;s Voodoo Graphics and Rendition&#x27;s Verité, and game titles such as Id Software&#x27;s popular &quot;Quake&quot; engine, resulted in an industry-wide shakeout. S3, along with other previously well-established VGA vendors in the PC market, were unable to adapt to the rapidly evolving PC 3D graphics market, being relegated to sell into market segments where 3D graphics functionality was unimportant. Although the ViRGE sold well in the OEM market, poor Direct3D performance and lack of OpenGL support prevented the ViRGE from competing in the more lucrative 3D graphics segment.

==Variants==
Between its birth in 1995 and retirement near the year 2000, the ViRGE family received regular upgrades. The ViRGE/DX boosted the performance of the original ViRGE/325 by improving perspective correction and implementing a full-speed trilinear filter. The ViRGE/GX added support for more modern SD/SGRAM. The ViRGE/GX2 was one of the first VGA chipsets to support AGP, although the level of support extended little beyond electrical compliance. Substantial use of AGP&#x27;s feature-set would have to wait until the Savage 3D.

The ViRGE was ultimately replaced by the Savage 3D in S3&#x27;s top-end graphics segment in 1998, which lacks support for the S3D API. However, at least one derivative (Trio3D) of the ViRGE remained in production even after the discontinuation of the Savage 3D.

<text>Thomas Burnet ( – 27 September 1715) was an English theologian and writer on cosmogony.

==Life==
He was born at Croft near Darlington in 1635. After studying at Northallerton Grammar School under Thomas Smelt, he went to Clare College, Cambridge in 1651. There he was a pupil of John Tillotson. Ralph Cudworth, the Master of Clare, moved to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1654, and Burnet followed him. He became fellow of Christ&#x27;s in 1657, M.A. in 1658, and was proctor in 1667.

Burnet took employment travelling with Lord Wiltshire, son of Charles Paulet, 6th Marquess of Winchester, and through Tillotson as tutor to Lord Ossory, grandson of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. The influence of the Duke of Ormonde, one of the governors, secured his appointment in 1685 to the mastership of Charterhouse . Burnet took part in the resistance offered to James II&#x27;s attempt to make Andrew Popham a pensioner of the Charterhouse. At two meetings held by the governors 17 January and Midsummer day 1687, the king&#x27;s letters of dispensation were produced, but, in spite of the efforts of George Jeffreys, a governor, the majority refused compliance.

After the Glorious Revolution Burnet became chaplain in ordinary and Clerk of the Closet to William III (until 1695). He received no clerical preferment and lived quietly in the Charterhouse, where he died on 27 September 1715, and was buried in the chapel.

==Works==

===&quot;Sacred Theory of the Earth&quot;===
Burnet&#x27;s best known work is his &quot;Telluris Theoria Sacra, or Sacred Theory of the Earth&quot;. The first part was published in 1681 in Latin, and in 1684 in English translation; the second part appeared in 1689 (1690 in English). It was a speculative cosmogony, in which Burnet suggested a hollow earth with most of the water inside until Noah&#x27;s Flood, at which time mountains and oceans appeared. He calculated the amount of water on Earth&#x27;s surface, stating there was not enough to account for the Flood. Burnet was to some extent influenced by Descartes who had written on the creation of the earth in &quot;Principia philosophiae&quot; (1644), and was criticised on those grounds by Roger North. The heterodox views of Isaac La Peyrère included the idea that the Flood was not universal; Burnet&#x27;s theory was at least in part intended to answer him on that point.

Burnet&#x27;s system had its novel features, as well as those such as the four classical elements that were very traditional: an initially ovoid Earth, a Paradise before the Flood that was always in the spring season, and rivers flowing from the poles to the Equator. Herbert Croft published criticism of the book in 1685, in particular accusing Burnet of following the Second Epistle of Peter rather than the Book of Genesis. During the 1690s John Beaumont and Johann Caspar Eisenschmidt picked up on Burnet&#x27;s ideas. They engendered a great deal of controversy at the time, and Burnet defended himself against selected critics, John Keill and Erasmus Warren.

Isaac Newton was an admirer of Burnet&#x27;s theological approach to geological processes. Newton even wrote to Burnet, suggesting the possibility that when God created the Earth, the days were longer. However, Burnet did not find this explanation scientific enough. Lengthening the days would require an intervention on God&#x27;s part. Burnet tightly held the belief that God created the world and all its processes perfectly from the start. He wrote:
We think him a better Artist that makes a Clock that strikes regularly at every hour from the Springs and Wheels which he puts into the work, than he that hath so made his Clock that he must put his finger to it every hour to make it strike.

===&quot;The Ancient Doctrine Concerning the Origin of Things&quot;===
Some of the views expressed in this work, also known as &quot;Archaeologiae Philosophicae sive Doctrina Antiqua de Rerum Originibus&quot; (1692), were so unacceptable to contemporary theologians that he had to resign his post at Court. In this he considered whether the fall of man was a symbolic event rather than literal history.

===&quot;On the State of the Dead and of the Resurrection&quot;===
Burnet&#x27;s treatise &quot;De Statu Mortuorum et Resurgentium&quot; was published posthumously in 1720. In Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; III p. 99 Gibbon made reference to Burnet&#x27;s &quot;De Statu Mortuorum et Resurgentium&quot; noting that Burnet &quot;exposes the inconveniences which must arise&quot;, if souls &quot;possess a more active and sensible existence&quot;. Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol and Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, criticised Gibbon and claimed that Burnet&#x27;s views were exactly the opposite.

==Influence==
Burnet&#x27;s work had an influence on Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He is quoted at the beginning of the 1817 edition of his &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

The ridge Dorsa Burnet in the Ocean of Storms on the Moon was named after him.

<text>John Hill Burton FRSE (22 August 1809 – 10 August 1881) was a Scottish advocate, historian and economist. The author of &quot;Life and Correspondence of David Hume&quot;, he was secretary of the Scottish Prison Board (1854–77), and Historiographer Royal (1867–1881).

==Life==

Burton was born in Aberdeen on 22 August 1809, the son of William Kinninmont Burton (&quot;d&quot;. 1819), a lieutenant in the army, and Elizabeth (&quot;d&quot;. 1848), daughter of John Paton of Grandholm, Aberdeenshire, He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Marischal College. After graduating, he moved to Edinburgh with his widowed mother and his sister, the educational reformer Mary Burton. He studied for the Bar, being admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1831. In 1832/3 the address of &quot;J.H. Burton advocate&quot; was given as 12 Fettes Row, in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. However, he had little practice, and in 1854 was appointed Secretary to the Prison Board of Scotland, and in 1877 a Commissioner of Prisons.

He became at an early period of his life a contributor to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and other periodicals, and in 1846 published a life of David Hume, which attracted considerable attention, and was followed by Lives of Lord Lovat and Lord President Forbes. He began his career as a historian by the publication in 1853 of &quot;History of Scotland from the Revolution to the Extinction of the last Jacobite Insurrection&quot;, to which he added (1867–70) &quot;History of Scotland from Agricola&#x27;s Invasion to the Revolution&quot;, in 7 vols., thus completing a continuous narrative. Subsequently, he published a &quot;History of the Reign of Queen Anne&quot; (1880). Other works of a lighter kind were &quot;The Book-Hunter&quot; (1862), and &quot;The Scot Abroad&quot; (1864). Burton&#x27;s historical works display much research and a spirit of candour and honesty, and have picturesque and spirited passages, but the style is unequal, and frequently lacks dignity. Nevertheless, he was one of the first historians to introduce the principles of historical research into the study and writing of the history of Scotland.

Burton died at his then home, Morton House on the southern edge of Edinburgh. He is buried in Dalmeny churchyard with his infant daughter Rose (1857–1858), to the north-east of the church, the stone cross being partly obscured by a large yew tree on its south side which screens it from the centre of the churchyard. The monument to his first wife, Isabella and their joint children is in Dean Cemetery and this bears a fine portrait head of Burton in high relief sculpted by William Brodie.

In 1901 it was publicly revealed that he supplied all the commentaries to the 240 architectural illustrations by Robert William Billings in &quot;The Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland&quot;, a work published in four volumes between 1845 and 1852, which contained 240 illustrations, with explanatory text. The work was a great success and has been reprinted several times, in 1899, 1900, 1901, 1908, 1909, 2008, 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

==Family==
On 23 July 1844, at Edinburgh, John Hill Burton married Isabella, daughter of David Lauder, a Captain in the Perthshire Militia, by his wife Janet Patrick. Isabella died in 1850, aged 40. Their daughter, Matilda Lauder &quot;Mattie&quot; Burton (1848–1928) married Dr William Lennox Cleland (1847–1918) on 21 June 1877. He was a noted surgeon in South Australia and for many years served as Director of Adelaide&#x27;s Parkside Lunatic Asylum, and as Colonial Surgeon (South Australia).

Burton married again, in 1855, Katherine, daughter of Cosmo Innes, the antiquarian. She was an author in her own right, who gave birth the next year to engineer W. K. Burton. They had nine children in total. Another of their children, Mary Rose Hill Burton, was a notable artist. A further son, Cosmo Innes Burton (1862–1890) was a short-lived but noteworthy chemist and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

<text>A book series is a sequence of books having certain characteristics in common that are formally identified together as a group. Book series can be organized in different ways, such as written by the same author, or marketed as a group by their publisher.

==Publishers&#x27; reprint series==

Reprint series of public domain fiction (and sometimes nonfiction) books appeared as early as the 18th century, with the series &quot;The Poets of Great Britain Complete from Chaucer to Churchill&quot; (founded by British publisher John Bell in 1777).

In 1841 the German Tauchnitz publishing firm launched the &quot;Collection of British and American Authors&quot;, a reprint series of inexpensive paperbound editions of both public domain and copyrighted fiction and nonfiction works. This book series was unique for paying living authors of the works published even though copyright protection did not exist between nations in the 19th century.

Later British reprint series were to include the &quot;Routledge&#x27;s Railway Library&quot; (George Routledge, 1848–99), the &quot;Oxford World&#x27;s Classics&quot; (Oxford University Press, from 1901), the &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Library&quot; (J. M. Dent, from 1906), the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; (Penguin Books, from 1945) and the &quot;Penguin English Library&quot; (from 1963).

Reprint series were also published in the United States, including the &quot;Modern Library&quot; (Boni &amp; Liveright, from 1917), in Germany, including the &quot;Universal-Bibliothek&quot; (Reclam, from 1867), and in most other countries of the world.

==Fiction books==

A novel sequence is a set or series of novels which share common themes, characters, or settings, but where each novel has its own title and free-standing storyline, and can thus be read independently or out of sequence. A novel sequence contains story arcs or themes that cross over several books, rather than simply sharing one or more characters.

Fictional series typically share a common setting, story arc, set of characters or timeline. They are common in genre fiction, particularly crime fiction, adventure fiction, and speculative fiction, as well as in children&#x27;s literature.

Some works in a series can stand alone—they can be read in any order, as each book makes few, if any, reference to past events, and the characters seldom, if ever, change. Many of these series books may be published in a numbered series. Examples of such series are works like The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and Nick Carter.

Some series do have their characters go through changes, and make references to past events. Typically such series are published in the order of their internal chronology, so that the next book published follows the previous book. How much these changes matter will vary from series to series (and reader to reader). For some, it may be minor—characters might get engaged, change jobs, etc., but it does not affect the main storyline. Examples of this type include Tony Hillerman&#x27;s Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn books. In other series, the changes are major and the books must be read in order to be fully enjoyed. Examples of this type include the Harry Potter series.

There are some book series that are not really proper series, but more of a single work so large that it must be published over two or more books. Examples of this type include &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; volumes or the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series by Stephen King.

Some authors make it difficult to list their books in a numerical order when they do not release each work in its &#x27;proper&#x27; order by the story&#x27;s internal chronology. They might &#x27;jump&#x27; back in time to early adventures of the characters, writing works that must be placed before or between previously published works. Thus, the books in a series are sometimes enumerated according to the internal chronology rather than in publication order, depending on the intended purpose for the list. Examples of this series include works from the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, where the fifth book published, &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, is actually set during the time of the first book, and the sixth book published, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; is actually set long before the first book. This was done intentionally by C. S. Lewis, a scholar of medieval literature. Medieval literature did not always tell a story chronologically.

===Definitions===
There is no useful, formal demarcation between novel sequences and multi-part novels. Novels that are related may or may not fall into a clear sequence. It is also debatable whether a trilogy is long enough and whether its parts are discrete enough to qualify as a novel sequence.

For example, the Barchester novels of Anthony Trollope are only loosely related, although they contain a recurring cast of characters; his political novels about the Pallisers have a tighter connection and dynamic. A strict definition might exclude both.

===History===
With precedents such as Madeleine de Scudéry&#x27;s magnum opus, Artamène, the novel sequence was a product of the nineteenth century, with James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s works appearing in the 1820s, and Anthony Trollope&#x27;s Barchester books in the 1850s. In French literature, Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s ambitious &quot;La Comédie humaine,&quot; a set of nearly 100 novels, novellas and short stories with some recurring characters, started to come together during the 1830s. Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; cycle is a family saga, a format that later became a popular fictional form, going beyond the conventional three-volume novel.

A roman-fleuve (French, literally &quot;river-novel&quot;) is an extended sequence of novels of which the whole acts as a commentary for a society or an epoch, and which continually deals with a central character, community or a saga within a family. The river metaphor implies a steady, broad dynamic lending itself to a perspective. Each volume makes up a complete novel by itself, but the entire cycle exhibits unifying characteristics.

The metaphor of the roman-fleuve was coined by Romain Rolland to describe his 10-volume cycle &quot;Jean-Christophe&quot;. In the preface to the seventh volume, &quot;Dans la maison&quot; (1908/1909) he wrote: &quot;When you see a man, do you ask yourself whether he is a novel or a poem? ... Jean-Christophe has always seemed to me to flow like a river; I have said as much from the first pages.&quot;

The term has subsequently been applied to other French novel sequences, particularly of the years between the world wars, notably:
*Marcel Proust, &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (1908–22)
*Georges Duhamel, &quot;Vie et aventures de Salavin&quot; (1920–32) and &quot;Chronique des Pasquier&quot; (1933–45)
*Roger Martin du Gard, &quot;The Thibaults&quot; (1922–40)
*Jules Romains, &quot;Les Hommes de bonne volonté&quot; (1932–47)
*Louis Aragon, &quot;Cycle du monde réel&quot; (1933–51)
*Jacques Chardonne, &quot;Les Destinées sentimentales&quot; (1934–36)
The 19th-century predecessors may be distinguished as being rather &quot;family sagas&quot;, as their stories are from the perspective of a single family, rather than society as a whole.

Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; has come to be regarded as a definitive &quot;roman fleuve&quot;. Today, however, its seven volumes are generally considered to be a single novel.

Proust&#x27;s work was immensely influential, particularly on British novelists of the middle of the twentieth century who did not favour modernism. Some of those follow the example of Anthony Powell, a Proust disciple, but consciously adapting the technique to depict social change, rather than change in high society. This was a step beyond the realist novels of Arnold Bennett (the &quot;Clayhanger&quot; books) or John Galsworthy.

===Twentieth century===
The twenty-novel Aubrey-Maturin series by the English author Patrick O&#x27;Brian has been called perhaps the best-loved &quot;roman fleuve&quot; of the twentieth century: &quot;[an] epic of two heroic yet believably realistic men that would in some ways define a generation&quot;.

===Development of the novel sequence===
Although sequences of genre fiction are sometimes not considered to be &quot;romans-fleuves&quot;, novel sequences are particularly common in science fiction and epic fantasy genres.

The introduction of the preconstructed novel sequence is often attributed to E. E. Doc Smith, with his &quot;Lensman&quot; books. Such sequences, from contemporary authors, tend to be more clearly defined than earlier examples. Authors are now more likely to announce an overall series title, or write in round numbers such as 12 volumes. These characteristics are not those of the classical model forms, and become more like the franchises of the film industry.

Notable nonfiction book series for the general public have included:
* Architecture: &quot;Pevsner Architectural Guides&quot;
* Biography: &quot;The Republic of Letters&quot;; &quot;Great Lives&quot;
* History: &quot;History of the Great War&quot;
* Science: &quot;New Naturalist Library&quot;
* Self Instruction: &quot;Teach Yourself&quot;
* Sport: &quot;Badminton Library&quot;
* Travel: &quot;Murray&#x27;s Handbooks for Travellers&quot;; &quot;Blue Guides&quot;

==Academic and scholarly publications==

In scholarly and academic publishing, scientific and non-fiction books that are released serially (in successive parts) once a year, or less often, are also called a series. (Publications that are released more often than once a year are known as periodicals.) The connection among books belonging to such a series can be by discipline, focus, approach, type of work, or geographic location. Examples of such series include the &quot;Antwerp Working Papers in Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile&quot;, &quot;Garland Reference Library&quot;, &quot;Canterbury Tales Project&quot;, &quot;Early English Text Society&quot;, and &quot;Cambridge Companions to Music&quot;.

== Compared with editorial collection ==

Book series can be compared with editorial collection, a type of serial publication which is common in the Romance-speaking world, especially in France. Although the two are similar in many ways, book series and editorial collection differ because books in a series generally have a common subject, character, or universe; in other words, a set of volumes that are related to each other by certain thematic elements. While books in a collection do not necessarily have a common subject, or a specific order, but with a certain affinity in the content of books (collections on art, on religion, on science...), as well as in the format, spine and page layout, even grammage, number of pages and style of typeface.

<doc id="937082" wikidata="Q1072342" url="?curid=937082" title="Moraine Lake">
<text>Moraine Lake is a snow and glacially fed lake in Banff National Park, outside the village of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada. It is situated in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, at an elevation of approximately . The lake has a surface area of .

The lake, being fed almost completely by snow-melt and glacial-melt, does not reach its crest until middle to late June. When it is full, it reflects a distinctive shade of azure blue. The unique colour is due to the refraction of the blue end of the spectrum of sunlight off the rock sediment deposited in the lake on a continual basis in summer by the surrounding glaciers. The lake is completely created by nature and has not been dammed, drained, or otherwise altered by humans in any way, other than the visitor services which are strictly controlled by the National Park. 

The road to Moraine Lake is only open during the summer months (June-Sep). Since 2023, Parks Canada has closed it to personal vehicles year-round with only Park shuttles, public transit and commercial operators allowed to access the road. Visitors can also bicycle or walk the road, which is 10 km / 6 miles long one-way.

==Tourism==

===Hiking trails===
The area around the lake has several walking/hiking trails that are, from time to time, restricted. The trail most commonly taken by tourists is The Rockpile Trail, which is along the actual moraine. The trail is approximately long, with an elevation change of . The view of the lake from the top of the rockpile is one of the most photographed locations in all of Canada. That view of the mountains behind the lake in Valley of the Ten Peaks is known as the &quot;Twenty Dollar View&quot;, as Moraine Lake was featured on the reverse side of the 1969 and 1979 issues of the Canadian twenty dollar bill; see . The area often experiences congestion due to the high level of tourism.

Along the same trail-head, the Consolation Lakes trail starts, which is approximately 3 kilometres long, with an elevation change of . Upon reaching Consolation Lakes hikers may continue along to the upper lake, which is not visible from the end of the lower lake. There is, however, no clearly marked trail, and can often be a scramble over large rocky areas.
Near the canoe docks of Moraine Lake Lodge there is another trailhead. This trail-head is the start of two trails, one of which branches out into four different trails - so there are in total, five trails starting at that trail-head (Moraine Lake Lakeshore Trail, Eiffel Lake, Wenkchemna Pass, Larch Valley, and Sentinel Pass). The Lake Louise &amp; Yoho Map provides information on these trails.

===Mountaineering routes===
The Neil Colgan Hut can be reached in 8 to 12 hours climbing the Perren Route from Moraine Lake.

=== Road access ===
In 2023, Parks Canada announced that personal vehicles would no longer be allowed on the road year-round. Visitors would need to use the Parks Canada Shuttle, public transportation, or a private operator to access the lake. People with disabilities are exempt if they have a permit, and the road is also still accessible by bike and foot. The agency said that the move was necessary because parking could not accommodate the surging traffic, with only a &quot;very small percentage&quot; of cars being allowed on the road in 2022 and the rest having to be turned away. It also noted how having to turn away so many vehicles was creating a safety hazard, with staff being confronted and harassed by disgruntled visitors.

<doc id="937084" wikidata="Q3666710" url="?curid=937084" title="Lady Charlotte Bury">
<text>Lady Charlotte Susan Maria Bury (née Campbell; 28 January 1775 – 1 April 1861) was an English novelist, who is chiefly remembered in connection with a &quot;Diary illustrative of the Times of George IV&quot; (1838).

==Early life==
Lady Charlotte Susan Maria Campbell was the daughter and the youngest child of Field Marshal John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll, and his wife the former Elizabeth Gunning; Elizabeth was the second daughter of John Gunning, of Castle Coote, County Roscommon, and the widow of James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton. Lady Charlotte was born at Argyll House, Oxford Street, London. In her youth she was noted for her personal beauty and charm, which made her one of the most popular persons in society. She was interested in &quot;belles-lettres&quot;, and knew the literary celebrities of the day, including the young Walter Scott. It was at one of her parties that Scott met &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis. At the age of twenty-two she anonymously published a volume of poems.

==Marriage==
She married on 14 June 1796 Colonel John Campbell (eldest son of Walter Campbell of Shawfield, by his first wife Eleanora Kerr), who, at the time of his decease in Edinburgh on 15 March 1809, was Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs. By this marriage she had nine children, of whom, however, only two survived her, Lady A. Lennox and Mrs. William Russell. Lady Charlotte Campbell married secondly, on 17 March 1818, the Reverend Edward John Bury (only son of Edward Bury of Taunton); they had two daughters. Bury received from University College, Oxford, his B.A. in 1811 and M.A. 1817. He assumed the position of rector in Litchfield, Hampshire, in 1814 and died at Ardencaple Castle, Dumbartonshire, in May 1832, aged 42.

==Lady-in-waiting to Caroline of Brunswick==
After Lady Charlotte had been widowed in 1809, she was appointed a Lady-in-Waiting in the household of Caroline of Brunswick, Princess of Wales. It is believed that she kept a diary, in which she recorded the foibles and failings of the princess and other members of the court. The diary was later published anonymously, and the identity of its author was revealed in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; by Lord Brougham; Lady Charlotte was rumoured to have received a thousand pounds from the publisher.

==Literary career==
After her marriage to Bury, she made various contributions to light literature; some of her novels were very popular, although now almost forgotten. When the &quot;Diary illustrative of the Times of George IV&quot; appeared in two volumes in 1838, with a further two volumes being added in 1839. it was thought to bear evidence of a familiarity with the scenes depicted which could only be attributed to Lady Charlotte. It was reviewed with much severity, and attributed to her ladyship by both the &quot;Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;Quarterly Reviews&quot;. The diary was a big success and several editions sold out in a few weeks. The charge of the authorship was not denied, and no one else has claimed to have written the diary, which public libraries began to catalogue under Lady Charlotte&#x27;s name. Volume 3 of the &quot;Diary&quot; was discovered by William Michael Rossetti to contain an encounter with William Blake; a rare description of the poet and artist from a contemporary.

==Disputed authorship==
There are many instances in the diary that call into question the identification of Campbell as the author, chiefly on page 339 of volume one where the diarist writes the paragraph quoted below. &quot;All goes gloomily for the Princess. Lady Charlotte Campbell told me, she regrets not seeing all these curious personages ; but, she said, the more the Princess is forsaken, the more happy she is at having offered to attend her at this time. This is very amiable in her and must be gratifying to the Princess.&quot; This paragraph clearly indicates that the diarist was a close acquaintance of Lady Charlotte, but not Lady Charlotte herself.

In a paragraph on Page 133 of volume 3 the diarist writes,
&quot;Lady C. hints that Mr. Brougham intends to restrict the Princess of Wales to thirty thousand pounds, and to employ the remainder in paying the debts ; and that the salaries of all her attendants must be diminished. Lady C. says she told him how herself and Lady C. Campbell were situated, and only desired him to do what he considered to be most just and equitable by all the household.&quot;
This indicates that Henry Brougham&#x27;s identification in the Edinburgh Review of Campbell as the author of the &quot;Diary Of The Times of George IV&quot; was wrong and may have been intentional to disguise the identity of the diarist, whose true identity he surely must have known.

==Death==
Lady Charlotte died at 91 Sloane Street, Chelsea, on 31 March 1861. She was curiously described in her death certificate at Somerset House as &quot;daughter of a duke and wife of the Rev. E. J. Bury, holding no benefice.&quot;

==Works==
The following is believed to be a complete list of Lady Charlotte&#x27;s writings; many of them originally appeared without her name, but even at that time there does not seem to have been any secret as to the identity of the writer:

<doc id="937085" wikidata="Q1049652" url="?curid=937085" title="Castlereagh Highway">
<text>Castlereagh Highway is a state highway located in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. From north to south the highway traverses South West Queensland and the North West Slopes, Orana, and Central West regions of New South Wales.

The highway is part of the Great Inland Way linking Sydney and Cairns, and provides all-weather access to rugged black opal country of Lightning Ridge.

Castlereagh Highway was named after the Castlereagh River, which it parallels for most of its journey north from Gilgandra.

==Route==
Castlereagh Highway commences at an intersection with Carnarvon Highway, south of , Queensland, and heads in a south-westerly direction via Dirranbandi to Hebel, where it crosses the state border with New South Wales just beyond and continues in a southerly direction, past Lightning Ridge to Walgett, where it crosses the Barwon and Namoi Rivers and meets the Gwydir and Kamilaroi Highways. Continuing south through Coonamble, the highway crosses the Castlereagh River and meets the Oxley and Newell Highways in Gilgandra. It continues in a south-easterly direction through Dunedoo, sharing a short concurrency with Golden Highway, continues through the regional centres of Gulgong and Mudgee, through Ilford and the junctions of Bathurst-Ilford Road and Bylong Valley Way, before eventually terminating at an interchange with Great Western Highway at Marrangaroo, north-west of Lithgow.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB, later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 55 was declared from the intersection with Great Western Highway near Marrangaroo, via Ilford, Mudgee, and Gulgong to Craboon (and continuing northwards via Coolah eventually to the intersection with Oxley Highway at Mullaley), Main Road No. 56 was declared from Walgett, via Coonamble to Gilgandra (and continuing southwards via Dubbo, Forbes, Cowra, Yass and Canberra eventually to the intersection with Queanbeyan-Braidwood Road, today Kings Highway, at Queanbeyan), and Main Road No. 205 was declared from Craboon via Dunedoo to Mendooran (and continuing northwards via Tooraweenah to Coonamble), on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to Trunk Roads 55 and 56 and Main Road 205 on 8 April 1929. Trunk Road 77 was later declared from the intersection with Oxley Highway at Gilgandra via Mendooran and Dunedoo, to Trunk Road 55 at Craboon, on 16 March 1938.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, declared State Highway 18 on 16 March 1938, from the intersection with State Highway 11 (later known as Oxley Highway) at Gilgandra via Coonamble and Walgett to the state border with Queensland near Brenda; with the declaration of State Highway 17 (later known as Newell Highway) on the same day, the northern end of Trunk Road 56 was truncated to meet State Highway 17 at Forbes, as a result. State Highway 18 was named Castlereagh Highway on 12 May 1954, after the Castlereagh River, with the river named in honour of Lord Castlereagh.

The alignment north of Lightning Ridge was altered on 17 June 1959 to meet the state border with Queensland at Hebel via Angledool, instead of via Brenda. In December 1982, a 15 kilometre deviation opened south of Mudgee as part of the Windamere Dam project.

The Roads &amp; Traffic Authority, succeeding the New South Wales DMR in 1989, extended the highway declaration south from Gilgandra via Dunedoo and Mudgee to Marrangaroo on 3 October 1997, subsuming Main Road 77 (previously Trunk Road 77). The southern end of Main Road 56 (previously Trunk Road 56) was truncated to meet State Highway 18 east of Craboon, as a result.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Castlereagh Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 18, from the state border with Queensland at Hebel to the intersection with Oxley Highway in Gilgrandra, then from the intersection with Newell Highway in Gilgandra to the intersection with Golden Highway in Dunedoo, then from the intersection with Golden Highway near Craboon to the interchange with Great Western Highway at Marrangaroo.

Within New South Wales, the highway was signed National Route 55 in 1974 from Gilgandra to Walgett, and State Route 86 south of Gilgandra; National Route 55 was extended north from Walgett to the border with Queensland in 1983. Queensland however signed Carnarvon Highway as National Route 55 between 1983 and 1997 rather than Castlereagh Highway, causing a major discrepancy for many years in that National Route 55 met the border at Hebel but abruptly begun again over east along the border at Mungindi. The Queensland Road Department changed this in 1997 and signed National Route 55 over the border north to St George, and eventually to Charters Towers in later years. With both states&#x27; conversion to the newer alphanumeric system between 2005 and 2013, its route number was updated to route A7 between Rolleston and Roma and A55 between Roma and the state border for the highway within Queensland in 2005, and eventually along the remaining highway within New South Wales as route B55 in 2013.

==Upgrades==
The Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, last updated in March 2022, includes the following project for Castlereagh Highway.

===Carnarvon Highway intersection upgrade===
A project to upgrade the intersection with Carnarvon Highway at a cost of $3.4 million was completed in mid-2022. This project was targeted for &quot;early works&quot; by the Queensland Government.

<text>&quot;Beep, beep&quot; is onomatopoeia representing a noise, generally of a pair of identical tones (beeps) following one after the other, often generated by a machine or device such as a car horn. It is commonly associated with the Road Runner (commonly interpreted as &quot;meep meep&quot;) in Looney Tunes cartoons featuring the speedy-yet-flightless bird and his constant pursuer, Wile E. Coyote. &quot;Beep, Beep&quot; is the name of a 1952 Warner Bros. cartoon in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series.

== Road Runner cartoons ==
Chuck Jones, the creator of Road Runner, has stated that this sound, the only way the Road Runner can harm the Coyote, was inspired by hearing a Doppler-like effect as background artist Paul Julian imitated a car horn when he could not see where he was going. Julian voiced the various recordings of the phrase used throughout the Road Runner cartoons, although on-screen he was uncredited for his work. Although commonly quoted as &quot;meep meep&quot;, Warner Bros., the current owner of all trademarks relating to the duo, lists &quot;beep, beep&quot; as the Road Runner&#x27;s sound, along with &quot;meep, meep.&quot; According to animation historian Michael Barrier, Julian&#x27;s preferred spelling of the sound effect was either &quot;hmeep hmeep&quot; or &quot;mweep, mweep&quot;.

In 1978, Warner Bros. recycled the Road Runner&#x27;s &quot;beep, beep&quot; sound for its television series, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, which featured a tiny robot-on-wheels named Rover who makes the &quot;beep, beep&quot; sound on occasion. It only appeared in the second-season episode &quot;I.R.A.C. is Missing&quot;.
So popular was the image of road-burning speed inspired by the Road Runner, that Plymouth (a division of Chrysler) named one of their V8-powered &quot;muscle car&quot; models after the cartoon bird. The car was fitted with Road Runner decals and a horn that made the well-known &quot;beep, beep&quot; sound when activated.

The Road Runner cartoon also later became associated with Time Warner&#x27;s Road Runner cable internet service.

In comic books, the Road Runner&#x27;s actual name was given as &quot;Beep Beep&quot;. In the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;, Homer Simpson meets a character – not Julian – named June Bellamy (herself a tribute to voice actress June Foray), who says she recorded the sound of the Road Runner. She comments, &quot;They only paid me to say [meep] once. Then they doubled it up on the soundtrack.&quot;

== The Playmates ==
&quot;Beep, Beep&quot; (&quot;The Little Nash Rambler&quot;) was a song which utilized the &quot;beep, beep&quot; sound in a tempo-changing novelty record recorded by the Playmates in 1958. The record became a #4 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 record chart for twelve weeks. The lyrics tell the story of how the beep-beep horn of the &quot;Little Nash Rambler&quot; following close behind the driver of a Cadillac infuriates him into going ever faster—but the Rambler driver keeps pace with the Cadillac, in order to yell out of his window to the Cadillac driver in the final line of the song, &quot;Hey, buddy, how can I get this car out of second gear?&quot;

<text>Lolita Lebrón (November 19, 1919 – August 1, 2010) was a Puerto Rican nationalist who was convicted of aggravated assault and other crimes after carrying out an armed attack on the United States Capitol in 1954, which resulted in the wounding of five members of the United States Congress. She was released from prison in 1979 after being granted clemency by President Jimmy Carter. Lebrón was born and raised in Lares, Puerto Rico, where she joined the Puerto Rican Liberal Party. In her youth she met Francisco Matos Paoli, a Puerto Rican poet, with whom she had a relationship. In 1941, Lebrón migrated to New York City, where she joined the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, gaining influence within the party&#x27;s leadership.

In the early 1950s, the Nationalist Party began a series of revolutionary actions, including the 1950 Jayuya Uprising against American presence on the island. They conducted these attacks to protest the false and misleading claims by the United States government and Luis Muñoz Marín that Puerto Rico would no longer be dominated by the United States. As part of this initiative, Pedro Albizu Campos ordered Lebrón to organize attacks in the United States, focusing on locations that were &quot;the most strategic to the enemy.&quot; Lebrón led a group of nationalists that attacked the United States House of Representatives in 1954.

She was convicted, found guilty and incarcerated as a result. Lebrón remained imprisoned for 25 years, until 1979 when Jimmy Carter issued commutations to the group involved in the attack. After their release in 1979, the group returned to Puerto Rico, where supporters of Puerto Rican independence received them warmly. During the following years, Lebrón continued her involvement in pro-independence activities, including the protesting the existence of a United States Navy base at Vieques. Her life would be subsequently detailed in books and a documentary. On August 1, 2010, Lebrón died from complications of a cardiorespiratory infection.

==Early life==
Lebrón (birth name: Dolores Lebrón Sotomayor ) was one of five siblings born in Lares, Puerto Rico to Gonzalo Lebrón Bernal and Rafaela Soto Luciano; the other four children were Aurea, Augusto, Gonzalo Jr. and Julio. Lebrón was raised in &quot;Hacienda Pezuelas&quot; in Pezuela, a barrio in Lares. Gonzalo Lebrón worked as the hacienda&#x27;s foreman earning a salary of $30 a month. The owner allowed to live in a &quot;small house&quot; and also permitted the family to plant produce.

In Pezuela, Lebrón began her education in a small community school. Early in her life, Lebrón contracted pneumonia when she accidentally fell into a gutter that was full of water. As a consequence of this illness, she grew with a frail body and was unable to keep up with the constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue. She developed an introverted and contemplative personality, often spending time admiring nature around the hacienda.

From Pezuela the family moved to Mirasol, also in Lares, where Gonzalo Lebrón administered a hacienda owned by Emilio Vilellas. There Lolita received a better education and attended a local public school. When Lebrón completed the sixth grade she attended the &quot;Segunda Unidad Rural&quot;, a middle school located in Bartolo, an adjacent barrio. She concluded her formal public school education in the eighth grade.

Lebrón had uncommonly good looks and when she was a teenager won first place in the annual &quot;Queen of the Flowers of May&quot; beauty contest held in Lares. Although her father was an atheist, Lebrón was baptized in the Catholic faith when she was fourteen years as were her other siblings. During the baptism celebration she met Francisco Matos Paoli, who became her first boyfriend. Paoli and Lebrón wrote letters to each other in which they exchanged the poetry which they wrote. According to Jossianna Arroyo, Lolita wrote &quot;more mystical poetry, centered on what she called &#x27;visions&#x27; filled with religious symbolism.&quot; Paoli&#x27;s family opposed their relationship because they considered Lebrón a &quot;jíbara&quot; (peasant). Her father also opposed this relationship and ordered her to stop writing Paoli. However, they both continued to write each other until Paoli moved out of the city.

Lebrón eventually moved to San Juan, where she studied sewing and continued her correspondence with Paoli. She felt duty bound to return to Lares because her father was severely affected by tuberculosis. The family was forced to abandon the house in the hacienda, but Ramón Santiago later provided them with a new house.

Lebrón took upon herself the responsibility of taking care of her father. She would travel to a nearby town to buy medicines for her father, which she gave him every seventy minutes. For seven days she didn&#x27;t sleep or eat while taking care of him. Following his death, Lebrón began supporting herself by weaving clothes.

==Political activism==
Although Lebrón was a member of the Liberal Party from a young age, she didn&#x27;t display any interest in politics. However, her posture changed after March 21, 1937, when a group of militants from the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party were killed during a peaceful protest which became known as the Ponce massacre. Lebrón who was eighteen years old at the time, developed a nationalistic ideology following this event. During this timeframe, Lebrón had a relationship with a local engineer, following the advice of her family. When she was twenty-one years old she gave birth to her first daughter Gladys, who was left in Rafaela Luciano&#x27;s custody after Lebrón was separated from her husband and moved to New York City. After she arrived in New York City, she started to experience problems finding employment, mostly because she did not fully understand English. Lebrón worked as a seamstress in several factories. She was fired from some of her jobs because she was considered a &quot;rebel by her bosses&quot; after she protested against the discrimination which she witnessed against Puerto Rican workers. This influenced her nationalistic views even further and she eventually established contact with members of the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement. She enrolled at George Washington College, where she studied for two years during her free time from work. She married again when she was twenty-two years old and gave birth to her second child, whom she would send to Puerto Rico to live with her mother, a year later. Lebrón decided to divorce her husband because she felt that he was oppressing her. In 1943, there was a massive migration of Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico to New York, composed mostly of seeking employment. Lebrón grew increasingly frustrated when she observed how they were forced to live in poverty, under social decadence, and prejudice, and she increased her work within nationalist circles. In 1946, she formally became a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, following the advice of a friend. During this time she developed an admiration for the Party&#x27;s president Pedro Albizu Campos, studying and memorizing his biography and ideals. After joining the party, Lebrón inadvertently included some of her own initiatives within the organization&#x27;s ideals, these were influenced by socialist and feminist ideals. Seeking more involvement in society and politics for women, new economic systems and social reforms that would protect women and children. Her constant involvement in the party&#x27;s affairs earned her several high-ranking positions, among them those of secretary, vice-president, and executive delegate of its delegation in New York.

On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD) and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill that day. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948.

Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, the only non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.

On November 1, 1950, following a series of uprisings in Puerto Rico which included the Jayuya Uprising and the Utuado Uprising which culminated in a massacre, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola invaded Harry S. Truman&#x27;s residence, carrying a letter written by Albizu Campos and addressed to Truman. A shootout erupted between the duo and the guard stationed there, killing Torresola. Collazo was badly injured but survived and was sentenced to death by an American jury. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party claimed that their goal was to &quot;draw attention to the fact of Puerto Rico&#x27;s continued colonial status&quot;, while the American government and media treated it as an assassination attempt. Following the sentence, Lebrón quickly joined the &quot;Committee for Oscar Collazo&#x27;s defense&quot;, participating in numerous public manifestations which eventually led to a presidential commutation. On July 25, 1952, the official name of Puerto Rico was changed to &quot;Estado Libre Associado&quot; (commonwealth of the United States) as a constitution was promulgated by Luis Muñoz Marín, the islands&#x27; first elected governor. In 1954, Lebrón received a letter from Albizu Campos, in which he declared his intention to order attacks on &quot;three locations, the most strategic to the enemy&quot;.

==Assault on the House of Representatives==
===Attack preparations===
Albizu Campos had been corresponding with 34-year-old Lebrón from prison and chose a group of nationalists who included Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andres Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to the leadership of the Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued. Lebrón decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault. She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding that a single attack on the House of Representatives would be more effective. The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the &quot;Conferencia Interamericana&quot; (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.

===The attack===
On the morning of March 1, Lebrón travelled to Grand Central Terminal, where she rendezvoused with the rest of the group. Once they arrived at the United States Capitol, Rafael Cancel Miranda suggested that the attack should be postponed because it was late and rainy. Lebrón responded, &quot;I am alone&quot; and continued towards the building&#x27;s interior. The group followed, considering the attack a coup d&#x27;état, the most important revolutionary act in the history of the Puerto Rican independence movement, the fourth uprising after the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot;, the &quot;Intentona de Yauco&quot; and the Jayuya Uprising. The other members of the group seemed serene and optimistic while rushing towards the legislative chamber.

When Lebrón&#x27;s group reached the visitor&#x27;s gallery above the chamber in the House, they sat while the representatives discussed Mexico&#x27;s economy. Shortly thereafter, Lebrón gave the order to the other members, the group quickly recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer; then Lebrón stood up and shouted &quot;¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!&quot; (&quot;Long live a Free Puerto Rico!&quot;) and unfurled the flag of Puerto Rico. The group opened fire with semi-automatic pistols. Lebrón claimed that she fired her shots at the ceiling, while Figueroa&#x27;s pistol jammed. Some 30 shots were fired (mostly by Cancel, according to his account), wounding five lawmakers; one representative, Alvin Morell Bentley from Michigan, was seriously wounded in the chest. Upon being arrested, Lebrón yelled, &quot;I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!&quot;.

===Trial and imprisonment===
Lebrón and her group were charged with attempted murder and other crimes. She was imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution for Women in Alderson, West Virginia. The trial began on June 4, 1954, with judge Alexander Holtzoff presiding over the case, under strict security measures. A jury composed of seven men and five women was assembled, their identities kept secret from the media. 
The prosecution was led by Leo A. Rover, as part of this process 33 witnesses testified. Ruth Mary Reynolds, the &quot;American/Puerto Rican Nationalist&quot; and the organization which she founded &quot;American League for Puerto Rico&#x27;s Independence&quot; came to the defense of Lebrón and the three other Nationalists. Lebrón and the other members of the group were the only defense witnesses, as part of her testimony she reaffirmed that they &quot;came to die for the liberty of her homeland&quot;. As part of her 20-minute speech to the jury at her trial, Lebrón stated that she was &quot;being crucified for the freedom of my country.&quot;

During the early part of their trial she remained calm, complaining through her lawyers alleged disrespect for the flag while it was being produced as evidence. She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might have suffered from mental instability while committing the deed. On June 16, 1954, the jury found all four defendants guilty. On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebrón learned of her son&#x27;s death minutes before the sentence was to be announced. She was quiet at the beginning of the hearing, but at one point, unable to contain herself, she became hysterical. Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible. In Lebrón&#x27;s case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on her behavior.

Back at the prison, she went into shock upon receiving official notice of her son&#x27;s death and did not speak for three days. On July 13, 1954, the four nationalists were taken to New York, where they pleaded not guilty to the charges of &quot;trying to overthrow the government of the United States&quot;. One of the witnesses for the prosecution was Gonzalo Lebrón Jr., who testified against his sister. On October 26, 1954, judge Lawrence E. Walsh found all the defendants guilty of conspiracy and sentenced them to six additional years in prison.

Lebrón was sentenced to a fifty-year prison term. Lebrón stated the first two years in prison were the most difficult, having to deal with the deaths of her son and mother. Communication with her siblings was non-existent. Lebrón refused to accept letters from her sister because only letters written in English were permitted in the prison. Communication with the outside world was not allowed then. Later it was granted after several inmates went on a hunger strike that lasted three and a half days. Due to her participation, Lebrón was not allowed to perform work outside of her cell for some time, although she was eventually allowed to work at the . While in prison, a group of judges offered her parole in exchange for a public apology, which she indignantly rejected.

After completing the first 15 years of the sentence, Lebrón&#x27;s social worker told her that she could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal, as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics, and the United States&#x27; use of the atomic bomb. Following this, the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them, and focus her attention in studying, as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón&#x27;s interest in religion grew. Lebrón&#x27;s daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.

==Later years, death and legacy==

In 1979 President Jimmy Carter commuted the sentences of Lolita Lebrón, Irvin Flores, and Rafael Cancel Miranda after they had served 25 years in prison. Andrés Figueroa Cordero was released from prison earlier because of a terminal illness. Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló publicly opposed the commutations granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Lebrón received a heroine&#x27;s welcome by her supporters upon her return to her motherland. Lebrón married Sergio Irizarry Rivera and continued to participate in pro-independence activities. The couple had met while she was in prison, when the Nationalist Party ordered him to monitor her health. Their marriage took place eight years after they had met. They moved into a small house in Loiza. The house possessed few distinctive traits, mostly composed of religious iconography and a large flag of Puerto Rico in the living room.
In 1979, Lolita Lebrón, Irvin Flores, Rafael Cancel Miranda and Oscar Collazo were recognized as the embodiment of the directive of their teacher Albizu Campos to exercise valor and sacrifice before representatives of fifty-one countries at the International Conference in Support of Independence for Puerto Rico, held in Mexico City.

That same year Lebrón and her group were awarded the Order of Playa Girón in Cuba. The Order of Playa Girón is a national order conferred by the Council of State of Cuba on Cubans or foreigners.

On May 22, 2000, she erroneously filed charges of verbal assault against Nívea Hernández, the mother of then-Puerto Rico Senator Kenneth McClintock who subsequently served as Minority Leader, and later President, of the Senate of Puerto Rico and now serves as Secretary of State, after a discussion ensued between her and an unidentified woman at a pharmacy in San Juan. The case was reported after an employee of the establishment identified the instigator as Hernández, who was recuperating from surgery at the moment and died two months later.

She continued to be active in the independence cause and participated in the protests against the United States Navy&#x27;s presence in Vieques. Lebrón appeared as a witness at the &quot;International Tribunal on Violations of Human Rights in Puerto Rico and Vieques&quot; held on November 17–21, 2000, on the island of Vieques. According to the local newspaper &quot;El Vocero&quot;, her audience applauded when Lebrón said at the end of her deposition &quot;I had the honor of leading the act against the U.S. Congress on March 1, 1954, when we demanded freedom for Puerto Rico and we told the world that we are an invaded nation, occupied and abused by the United States of America. I feel very proud of having performed that day, of having answered the call of the motherland&quot;. On June 26, 2001, Lebrón was among a group of protesters that were arrested for trespassing in the restricted area in Vieques. On July 19, 2001, she was sentenced to 60 days of prison on the charge that she was trespassing on Navy property. Lebrón had already served 23 days in jail since her June arrest, leaving her to serve 37 additional days. Less than two years after Lebron&#x27;s Vieques protest, on May 1, 2003, the U.S. Navy left Vieques and turned over its facilities to the government of Puerto Rico. Following this, she continued her participation in other pro independence activities.

On September 5, 2005, the couple was transported to a hospital, after a fire affected part of their house, causing $14,000 in material losses.

Lebrón was among the political leaders that opposed the Democratic Party&#x27;s primary that took place on June 1, 2008. The group anticipated a low voter turnout in the event, while declaring that Puerto Rico &quot;deserves sovereignty&quot;. On June 10, 2008, Lebrón suffered a fracture in her hip and a wrist after accidentally falling in her house. She underwent corrective surgery at a San Juan hospital. A film inspired by Lebrón&#x27;s life was being considered in 2009, with actress Eva Longoria. but was never produced.

Between 2008 and 2010, Lebrón was hospitalized multiple times, the first being due to a fall that fractured her hip and an arm, requiring surgery. On September 18, 2009, she suffered a notable relapse due to a cardio respiratory infection. Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory manner and issued a press release in appreciation for the public&#x27;s support. Complications from this episode of bronchitis, however, persisted throughout 2010, leading to her death on August 1, 2010. Multiple public figures, who support independence or free association for Puerto Rico, immediately lamented Lebrón&#x27;s death, praising her activism. Her life was eulogized in some European papers.

=== Legacy ===
Among the homages received by Lebrón are paintings, books and a documentary. Mexican artist Octavio Ocampo created a poster of Lebrón, which was exhibited at the Galería de la Raza in San Francisco, California. In Chicago&#x27;s Humboldt Park, there is a mural depicting Lebrón among other well known Puerto Ricans. In addition to these works, Lebrón became a popular subject in silkscreen art. One such work that has garnered a lot of attention is Linda Lucero’s work &quot;Lolita Lebrón: ¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!&quot; The artist was interested in learning about political prisoners being held in the United States, and Lebrón stood out to her as a potential subject for a poster regarding the formation of a community. Furthermore, as a resident of San Francisco’s Mission District, a region whose Latino population featured only a small percent of Puerto Ricans, Lucero’s decision to depict Lebrón was unexpected, and perhaps reflected the “internal colony” thesis. One of the most often discussed elements of the work is that Lebrón, typically regarded as a white woman by Puerto Ricans, is rendered in burnt sienna to highlight her brown skin. The poster is perceived as portraying Lebrón as a contemplative, suffering figure, who some scholars regard as embodying a &quot;racialized colonial subject who suffers at the hands of an imperial power&quot;. This artistic portrayal of Lebrón contrasts the common interpretation of the US press’ portrayal of her as a femme fatale. This work became widely recognized, and is today housed in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

Another silkscreen representation of Lebrón, also in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, is &quot;Lolita Lebrón, Puerto Rican Freedom Fighter&quot;by Marcos Dimas. In contrast to Lucero’s suffering Lebrón, or the media’s description of her as a terrorist, with headlines such as “When terror wore lipstick,” Dimas represents a portrayal of Lolita Lebrón that scholars regard as “heroic,” showing her in three-quarter profile with her eyes defiantly raised and staring ahead in determination, repeated four times in the same color palette on the poster, and declaring her as a “Puerto Rican Freedom Fighter”. Beyond art, writer, director and film producer Judith Escalona is planning to make a film about Lebrón&#x27;s life.Federico Ribes Tovar published a book titled &quot;Lolita la Prisionera&quot;.

There is a plaque, located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Lebron&#x27;s name is on the first line of the third plate.

Among the books that include the story of Lebrón are &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets&quot; by Irene Vilar (Lebrón&#x27;s granddaughter), translated by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as &quot;A Message from God in the Atomic Age&quot;). The author criticizes her grandmother as &quot;a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it.&quot; It also documents the death of Lebrón&#x27;s only daughter (Vilar&#x27;s mother) as suicide. Irene Vilar began to write the novel in a psychiatric hospital in Syracuse, New York.

Lebrón&#x27;s granddaughter, Vilar, may have had a slight change of heart after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. She recalled her grandmother&#x27;s wisdom in that she often said that if Puerto Ricans could feed themselves they could have their country. Vilar appealed for donations of seeds (farmers had lost everything), and received &quot;so many we didn&#x27;t know what to do with them&quot; so she started the &quot;Resilience Fund&quot; with Tara Rodriguez Besosa. She felt they had to work quickly to save farms and farmer&#x27;s livelihoods.

<text>Gale Cincotta (December 28, 1929 – August 15, 2001), a community activist from the Austin neighborhood of Chicago, led the national fight for the US federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) of 1975 and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977. The CRA requires banks and savings and loans to offer credit throughout their entire market areas and prohibits them from targeting only wealthier neighborhoods with their lending and services, a practice known as redlining. She was a co-founder with Shel Trapp of the National People&#x27;s Action in Chicago, a coalition of some 300 community organizations throughout the United States, and served as its executive director and chairperson from 1973 until her death in 2001.

==Background==
Cincotta was born Aglaia Angelos on December 28, 1929 in Chicago, Illinois, an only child. Her father was Greek and her mother was Latvian, and they ran Greek restaurants. Her parents were Socialists, and Cincotta grew up around political talk in her father&#x27;s restaurant. She grew up in Garfield Park, and stayed on Chicago&#x27;s West Side. In school, although she was punished for it, Cincotta described herself as ethnically American. Cincotta left school after tenth grade, and married a gas station owner. At age 16, she moved to Austin, Chicago with her new husband, Roy Cincotta. Cincotta had her first child at seventeen, and had six sons total. In 1952, Cincotta made the decision to send her children to Chicago Public Schools, and as they matriculated, she became increasingly displeased with the quality of their education. Her sons were not learning to read, classrooms were overcrowded, and textbooks were worn and outdated. Cincotta learned that the school system was spending $250 per student per year in Austin, compared with $650 per student in other schools. She joined the Parent-Teacher Association to work to improve conditions in the school and in the city.

== Activism ==
In Austin, Chicago in the 1960s, real estate agents, colloquially called &quot;panic peddlers,&quot; encouraged white homeowners to sell before their property values fell, or before banks stopped lending to homeowners in the area, a practice called redlining. Cincotta became aware that the quality of the schools was tied to the real estate values in the area. Her activism branched from direct involvement with her children&#x27;s schools to local movements for fairer financial practices. She led protests against unfair landlords and saw results. Through her community organizing work in the mid-1960s, Cincotta met with community organizers, including Shel Trapp, who would become her partner in activism. Cincotta and Trapp founded the Organization for a Better Austin (OBA), and Cincotta served as various committee chairs before serving as president of OBA for two years. In 1972, Cincotta, Trapp, and Anne-Marie Douglas founded the National Training and Information Center (NTIC), and laid the foundations of National People&#x27;s Action (NPA). Also in the early 1970s, Cincotta took a position with the Metropolitan Area Housing Alliance. This job allowed Cincotta to support her family after her husband died in 1976.

Cincotta became known for her community organizing style. As the director of NPA, in addition to using formal channels of communication to reach politicians and bureaucrats, she organized &quot;hits.&quot; &quot;Hits&quot; were confrontational protests outside of the offices, headquarters, and sometimes private residences of those in conflict with NPA. According to a statement by the NTIC, &quot;At protests, Ms. Cincotta would alternately schmooze and threaten her targets, until they conceded the meetings she demanded.&quot; NPA led the national push for the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), which Cincotta and Trapp helped draft. According to Senator William Proxmire, HMDA &quot;would never have become a law but for the research and local organizing activity undertaken by NPA.&quot; The culmination of Cincotta&#x27;s activism was the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977. Through her roles with the NTIC and NPA, Cincotta pushed for the passage of the CRA, and earned the appellation &quot;Mother of the CRA.&quot;

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Cincotta to the National Commission on Neighborhoods. In the late 1980s, she served on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp&#x27;s National Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. Of Cincotta, Kemp said she was &quot;one of the most substantive and knowledgeable leaders in low- and moderate-income housing that I have met in the country.&quot; In 1994, Cincotta became a member of Fannie Mae&#x27;s Housing Impact Advisory Council, and in Chicago, she was on the Community Investment Advisory Council of the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Cincotta is well known for her flamboyant activism. In 1970, to protest inadequate pest control in Austin, Cincotta led a group of 100 protesters to nail a rat to the ward alderman&#x27;s office door. In 1980, Cincotta was responsible for placing Saturday Night Live&#x27;s Land Shark above the entrance to the Federal Reserve Bank (to imply the bankers were loan sharks), and red tape strung around the building (to symbolize redlining). This move prompted the bank chairman Paul Volcker to meet with Cincotta.

DePaul University Special Collections and Archives holds a collection of notes, research, and publications about Gale Cincotta. The collection was created by Michael Westgate and Ann Vick-Westgate while writing &quot;Gale Force: Gale Cincotta, the Battles for Disclosure and Community Investment&quot;, about Cincotta and her activism in Chicago.

== Awards ==
In 1985, Cincotta received the Chicago Commission on Human Rights Award, and Cincotta was named one of the &quot;Ms.&quot; Foundation Women of the Year. Cincotta also won the first Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago Neighborhood Partnership Award.

<text>Arthur Vidrine (December 20, 1896 - December 20, 1955) was a physician from Ville Platte, the seat of Evangeline Parish in south Louisiana, who was best known for having operated on Democratic U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long Jr., after Long was shot on September 8, 1935, in the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge, presumably by another young physician, Carl A. Weiss.

A veteran of World War I, Vidrine was educated at Tulane University in New Orleans, the University of Oxford (where he was a Rhodes Scholar), and at hospitals in London and Paris. Then Governor Long first appointed Vidrine superintendent of Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Then in May 1931, Long named Vidrine dean of the newly established Louisiana State University Medical School in New Orleans.

After Senator Long was shot, Vidrine performed an operation to repair two small wounds in the colon. He then sutured the abdomen closed. Two surgical experts who had been called from New Orleans to operate on Long were delayed by an automobile accident. Vidrine was later criticized by other doctors for having failed to recognize a kidney wound that caused internal bleeding and which ultimately led to Long&#x27;s death. However, due to the lack of technology at the time, it was easier to make that mistake. He also operated under extreme pressure and was unable to operate well with the added stress of such a high profile patient.

Vidrine left New Orleans due to the mishap and resided in Ville Platte, Louisiana with his family. He now has one remaining child of 3, his eldest daughter and child. His family moved back to New Orleans while he lived in Ville Platte, visiting each other often.

==History==

In 1917, the then Diwan of Mysore, Sir M. Visvesvaraya, felt the need to have an engineering college in the state as the College of Engineering, Guindy and College of Engineering, Pune were unable to accommodate enough students from Mysore State.

He started the college in 1917 in Bangalore as a School of Engineering with 20 students in Civil and Mechanical Engineering branches in the PWD building. S V Setty was a founding professor. It was the fifth engineering college to be started in India and the first one in the Mysore State. In 1965, the name of the college was changed to University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE), after the founder. For the first time in India, a department of Electrical Engineering was established in UVCE in 1921.

UVCE had been affiliated to Bangalore University since 1964. Dr. Venugopal K R, UVCE alumni, Principal UVCE and Vice Chancellor Bangalore University was the Special Officer to the Government of Karnataka for Trifurcating Bangalore University. He submitted the report on 26 March 2015 for restructuring Bangalore University into Bangalore University, Bengaluru City University and Bengaluru North University and UVCE to be carved out as Centre of Excellence on the model of Indian Institute of Technology. UVCE was granted autonomy by a bill tabled in Karnataka assembly and now UVCE is an autonomous institution with effect from 25 March 2022 with the UVCE Act 2021.

<doc id="937117" wikidata="Q6217174" url="?curid=937117" title="Johannesburg freeways">
<text>Johannesburg is heavily dependent upon freeways for transport around the city due to its location 1,500 metres above sea level, far from the coast or any major bodies of water. There are 10 freeways in the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area: the N1, N3, N12, N14, N17, R21, R24, R59, M1 and M2. In addition, three new freeways are planned: the G5, G9 and G14. Freeways are sometimes called highways or motorways colloquially.

The Johannesburg Ring Road that circles the city is formed by the N1 (Western Bypass), N3 (Eastern Bypass) and N12 (Southern Bypass). The N14 connects the West Rand with Pretoria. The N17 connects the Johannesburg Central Business District and southern parts of the city with Springs on the East Rand and the province of Mpumalanga. The R21 connects the East Rand and OR Tambo International Airport with Pretoria. The R24 connects central Johannesburg to the airport. The R59 connects Johannesburg with Vereeniging in the Vaal Triangle. The M1 runs the length of the city north–south, from Soweto to Buccleuch, where it becomes the N1. The Johannesburg-Pretoria highway is also called the Ben Schoeman Highway and is part of the N1. The M2 runs the length of the central part of the city east–west, from Germiston to Main Reef Road (R41 Road) in Crown, just south-west of the Johannesburg Central Business District.

The N1 (Ben Schoeman Highway) between Johannesburg and Pretoria is now becoming severely overloaded. Reports suggest that the road carries 180,000 vehicles a day between the two cities. The road is heavily congested as traffic enters Johannesburg in the mornings and leaves at night, as many people work in Johannesburg but live in Pretoria. As a result, the Gauteng Provincial Government has put in motion plans to alleviate heavy traffic congestion, which is likely to worsen. One plan that was partially completed before South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the Gautrain: a rapid rail system with a north–south line between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and an east–west line between OR Tambo International Airport and Sandton. The east–west line opened in June 2010, just before the World Cup.
The north–south line opened from Pretoria to Rosebank in August 2011; after delays caused by excessive water seepage in a major tunnel, the Rosebank–Johannesburg section opened in July 2012.

== Planned Freeways ==
The Star and Engineering News report that three new freeways have been planned for Johannesburg:

* The PWV9, linking the northern part of Johannesburg with the western part of Pretoria, aligned along the existing R80 axis known as the Mabopane Freeway. It will run parallel to the N1 and will intersect with the N14.
* The PWV5, which will link the R21 with the new PWV9, crossing the N1 at the Olifantsfontein interchange.
* The PWV14 will provide a new link between the existing M2 and OR Tambo International Airport via Germiston.

In addition, there were plans afoot to extend the N17 from its end in Johannesburg South, to Krugersdorp, which would have allowed motorists to traverse the metropolitan area in under an hour in free-flowing traffic.

<doc id="937118" wikidata="Q4739183" url="?curid=937118" title="Mei Pass">
<text>Mei Pass () is a strategic site around north of Nanxiong in Guangdong, China. It is situated in the Meiling Mountains () and forms the boundary between the provinces of Jiangxi and Guangdong.

The site of Mei Pass has been significant since the Qin dynasty (221BCE206CE) and its name probably dates from this early period. It was part of one of the five transport routes from the Yangtze valley to Nanhai in present-day Guangzhou. During the Tang (618907), the site was variously called Qin Pass () and Hengpu Pass (). In 716, the Chancellor Zhang Jiuling constructed a wide road through the pass as part of the trade route along the Gan River. Of the old gallery road, Zhang wrote:
&lt;poem&gt;Formerly, an abandoned road in the east of the pass, 
Forbidding in the extreme, a hardship for men.
An unswerving course: you clambered aloft 
On the outskirts of several miles of heavy forest,
With flying bridges, clinging to the brink
Halfway up a thousand fathoms [] of layered cliffs?&lt;/poem&gt;

During the Song dynasty (9601279), fortifications were constructed on the pass and the characters representing Mei Pass were carved on it. The Tang road was improved with brick paving. The surviving fortifications have the words &quot;Majestic pass of Nanyue&quot; () carved on the northern side and &quot;First pass of Lingnan&quot; () carved on the other side. (Both Nanyue and Lingnan are alternative names for Guangdong.)

Until recent decades, Mei Pass was an important thoroughfare for the overland trade south to Guangdong, as well as a militarily significant boundary. In 1928, Mao Zedong attempted to cross the pass from Jiangxi into Guangdong. In the 1930s, the Communist commander Chen Yi spent three years in the vicinity of Mei Pass fighting a protracted guerilla war against Kuomintang encirclement.

Mei Pass has been designated as a Cultural Relic Protection Unit by the provincial authorities and draws small numbers of domestic tourists. Around of the Tang road and most of the Song fortifications are still extant. Most tourists visit in winter, when the plum blossoms are in full bloom.</text><links>

<doc id="937122" wikidata="Q593044" url="?curid=937122" title="Louis-Philippe Pigeon">
<text>Louis-Philippe Pigeon, (February 8, 1905 – February 23, 1986) was a Canadian lawyer, academic, and puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

==Early life and education==
Pigeon was born in Henryville, Quebec in 1905, the son of Arthur Pigeon and Maria Demers. He studied law at the Université Laval and obtained an LL.L in 1928, winning the Governor General&#x27;s gold medal. Called to the Bar of Quebec the same year, he settled in Quebec City.

==Legal career==
Pigeon began his legal career in 1928 with the firm of St-Laurent, Gagné, Devlin et Taschereau, headed by Louis St-Laurent, future Prime Minister of Canada. He practised with the firm until 1935. In 1940, he became law clerk of the Legislature of Quebec. He held that position for four years before joining the law firm of Germain, Lapointe, Thibaudeau et Roberge.

==Academic career==
Pigeon taught civil law and constitutional law part-time at the Université Laval for fifteen years, beginning in 1938. One of his students, William Tetley, subsequently a legal academic himself, records that Pigeon was a generalist who also had deep specialist knowledge of various areas of the law. For instance, Pigeon was once asked on a moment&#x27;s notice to fill in for an absent lecturer on civil procedure. He walked into the class-room and gave a masterful lecture on the issue, without any preparation time.

Tetley also gives an interesting glimpse of Professor Pigeon&#x27;s conduct of his class. Pigeon was apparently famous for not allowing questions from students, preferring simply to lecture. Tetley only remembered this approach being challenged on one occasion:

It was [a] hot day and we sat packed together in rows in a small room, with the windows closed. Someone either Jean Bienvenue (later a Quebec Cabinet Minister and Judge of the Superior Court) or Philippe Casgrain (later senior partner of the giant national law firm of Fraser Milner Casgrain) or Gaby Lapointe (flamboyant and famous criminal lawyer) put his hand up to ask a question. We all drew in our collective breath at such audacity and Pigeon was also very surprised. Finally Pigeon said &quot;oui&quot; in his very high pitched voice and the student said &quot;Puis-je poser une question?&quot; [&quot;May I ask a question?&quot;] Pigeon reflected and said &quot;oui&quot; and the student said &quot;Puis-je ouvrir la fenêtre?&quot; [&quot;May I open the window?&quot;] Pigeon reflected again and said &quot;non&quot; and that was the end of the Prof. Pigeon’s version of the Socratic method for the day.

The next day the same student raised his hand, we students were doubly astounded and Pigeon delayed, being himself quite suspicious. Eventually he said &quot;oui&quot; and the student asked &quot;Puis-je réitérer ma question de hier?&quot; [&quot;May I repeat my question from yesterday?&quot;] Pigeon replied &quot;non&quot; in his high pitched voice and that was the beginning and end of the Pigeon’s Socratic method for the year and no doubt thereafter.

Tetley also records that Pigeon was instrumental in René Lévesque&#x27;s failure to complete his law degree. Lévesque, at that time in third year, had been caught smoking in Pigeon&#x27;s class. He refused to apologise to Pigeon, as was the requirement at the time, and left the study of law for journalism.

Over his career spanning fifty years, Pigeon was the author of numerous major publications on legal matters. Many of his writings still serve as standard legal reference works.

Pigeon&#x27;s teaching notes for constitutional law are archived under the title &quot;Cours de droit constitutionnel : Notes de cours de Mtre Louis-Ph. Pigeon,&quot; at the Bibliothèque et archives nationales du Québec. His text on statutory interpretation was a standard work on the subject, published in both French and English.

==Government advisor==
From 1940 to 1944, Pigeon was law clerk for the Legislature of Quebec. Following the defeat of the Liberal government of Adélard Godbout in the 1944 general election, Pigeon continued to act as an informal advisor to Godbout, as recollected by Tetley:

Hudon [the Dean of Law at Laval], a Conservative and adviser to Prime Minister Duplessis, was a rival of Pigeon, who was a Liberal and the adviser to Adélard Godbout, the Liberal Leader of the Opposition. During question period in the National Assembly (then known as the Legislative Assembly), Hudon would stand behind the green curtain on the left side of the Speaker&#x27;s Chair and advise Duplessis, when a particular question of the Opposition was difficult. Pigeon stood behind the same curtain on the other side and fed questions and advice to Godbout. When the question period was over, the two adversaries — Hudon and Pigeon — would walk out arm-in-arm, complaining audibly about the state of politics and politicians.

Pigeon also acted as a legal adviser to Georges-Émile Lapalme, leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, then to the Premier of Quebec, Jean Lesage, from 1960 to 1966.

==Professional organizations==
Pigeon was active in the Jeune Barreau du Québec, becoming secretary in 1935, and president the following year. In 1936, he was both a bencher of the Barreau du Québec, and a delegate to the Conseil général du Barreau.

Pigeon was president of the Société d&#x27;études juridiques de Québec in 1947–48. From 1963 to 1967, Pigeon was the chairman of the National Council on the Administration of Justice. He served as vice-president of the Canadian Bar Association in 1965–1966, vice-president of the Uniform Law Conference of Canada in 1966–1967, and President of the Conseil national d&#x27;éthique professionnelle, also in 1966–1967.

==Supreme Court of Canada==
On September 21, 1967, Pigeon was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. He served on the Court for twelve years.

Pigeon retired from the Court on February 8, 1980, his 75th birthday, when he reached the mandatory retirement age.

==Later life==
Justice Pigeon was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1980, following his retirement. He was appointed an Officer of the Order nationale du Québec in 1985.

From 1980 onwards, Pigeon was a visiting professor at the Civil Law Section of the Faculty of Law at the University of Ottawa. He also acted as Director of the Graduate Studies Program in legislative drafting at the University of Ottawa.

He died on February 23, 1986, at the age of 81.

<text>St George is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Balonne, Queensland, Australia. It is the administrative centre for the Shire of Balonne.

In the , the locality of St George had a population of 3,130 people.

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
The present township of St George was founded on the boundaries of three Aboriginal groups, the Mandandanji to the north, the Kooma to the south-west and the Bigambul to the south-east.

These people of the Balonne River fished with hoop nets and hunted ducks and marsupials for meat. They supplemented their diet with the small native melons that grew in abundance in the area, and with yams dug out from the flats along the riverbanks. Their funeral rites consisted of constructing an elevated bark platform on which the deceased would be placed, with fires lit underneath to smoke and preserve the corpse. The mummified remains would then be wrapped in bark and possum cloaks and carried with care by the relatives until they were deposited in a hollow of a tree. Surrounding trees were marked and decorated.

=== British colonisation ===
In 1845, pastoralist squatters John Gordon Town and Christopher Bagot entered the vicinity looking for land to take up for cattle. The local Commissioner for Crown Lands, Roderick Mitchell conducted an expedition along the Balonne River later that year, taking the name for the river from the Aboriginal residents.

In 1846, the site where the town of St George now stands was Major Thomas Mitchell&#x27;s Camp VIII of his expedition into northern Australia. He noticed the natural rocky ford across the Balonne River on St George&#x27;s Day, 23 April, thereby naming the site St George&#x27;s Bridge. He directed his second-in-charge Edmund Kennedy to construct a cattle depot there while he explored further north. Kennedy and his stockmen remained at St George&#x27;s Bridge for around a month.
In 1847, the first cattle stations were established: Burgorah (also known as Warroo, owned by Robert Fitzgerald and managed by Patrick Brennan); Boombah (owned by Henry Dangar and managed by George Hazard); Gulnarbar (owned by George and Anthony Loder, and managed by William Clay); and Wagoo (also known as Wachoo or Culpa, owned by William Ogilvie Jnr, and managed by Robert Hazard).

Conflict with the local Aboriginal people over land and the killing of cattle ensued with around 40 Aboriginal people and up to nine whites being killed on Burgorah in 1849, Patrick Brennan being wounded in the leg by a spear. Aboriginal men later counter-attacked the stockmen on Burgorah, forcing them to flee to the nearby Boombah property, where Dangar&#x27;s men were able to reinforce and arm both the stockmen and members of a rival Aboriginal clan. Upon returning to Burgorah, they slaughtered the resident Aboriginal people, burying around 70 of their corpses in a large pit.

In 1852, sweeps by the paramilitary Native Police began in the area. Sergeant Richard Dempster with property managers Patrick Brennan and others, shot at least five Aboriginal people on Wagoo. Later that year, a detachment under Lieutenant George Fulford drove the free Aborigines into the &quot;back country&quot;. Some Aboriginal people were allowed to remain on the properties to be utilised as labourers and prostitutes. These were called &quot;station blacks&quot; and by 1855 there were around 40 remaining on Burgorah and 200 at Boombah.

By 1862, Burgorah and Gulnarbar were being utilised as a temporary Native Police barracks where Aboriginal prisoners were tied to trees and flogged, and occasionally shot dead. Lieutenant John Marlow and his troopers made a final sweep of the region in 1862, destroying Aboriginal camps and pursuing them as far as Angellala Creek where he &quot;dispersed&quot; them after a brief battle.

=== Township of St George ===
The township of St George was gazetted upon a portion of the Burgorah run in March 1864 with the first 59 parcels of land offered for sale a month later.

Andrew Nixon was contracted in 1890 by the Queensland government to build a timber bridge across the Balonne River at St George&#x27;s Bridge. This was completed in 1892 and later replaced by the current Andrew Nixon bridge and Jack Taylor Weir in 1953.

The first St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in 1874; it is now known as the old parish hall.
On 3 May 1959 the new St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was blessed and opened.

The Balonne Beacon newspaper was published in St George from 2 January 1909 to 29 December 1954. The St. George Standard and Balonne Advertiser newspaper was published from 1878 - 1879 and 1902 - 1904.

=== Floods ===

The town was severely affected by flooding in March 2010, which peaked at 13.5 metres, and again in December 2010 - January 2011.

Flooding once again occurred in February 2012, and about 2000 residents were mandatorily evacuated on 4 and 5 February to evacuation centres in Dalby and Brisbane. A temporary levee was built in St George on the morning of 5 February (Sunday). The Balonne River reached a height of 13.85 metres on Tuesday 7 February.

The reserve was established in 2024 as a partnership between Queensland&#x27;s Environment Department, Gunggari Native Title Aboriginal Corporation and Gunggari native title holders, Glencore mining company, and the Wombat Foundation. Fifteen of the wombats were relocated from Epping Forest National Park in early June 2024.

=== Richard Underwood Nature Refuge ===

The Richard Underwood Nature Refuge (RUNR) is also near St George, and is home to 18 wombats. The area, which lies along the banks of the Balonne River, was gazetted in 2008 as wombat habitat, and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) took on the lease in October 2023. The landowners are Ed and Gabrielle Underwood. It is also home to much other wildlife, including &quot;at least 15 other species of native mammals, 12 species of amphibians, 31 species of reptiles, and at least 83 species of birds&quot; . The refuge is completely fenced, to expel feral cats and other predators. Vegetation includes eucalypts such as silver-leaved ironbark and poplar box, along with white cypress pine and belah trees. Native grasses such as mulga mitchell grass and feathertop wiregrass grow at ground level.

<text>CHAN-DT (channel 8), branded Global British Columbia or Global BC (formerly British Columbia Television or BCTV), is a television station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, serving as the West Coast flagship of the Global Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Corus Entertainment, the station has studios on Enterprise Street (across from the Lake City Way SkyTrain station) in the suburban city of Burnaby, which also houses Global&#x27;s national news headquarters. Its transmitter is located atop Mount Seymour in the district municipality of North Vancouver.

==History==
The station first signed on the air at 4:45 p.m. on October 31, 1960. Founded by Art Jones&#x27; Vantel Broadcasting, it originally operated as an independent station. It acquired several programs from CTV upon that network&#x27;s launch on October 1, 1961; it would eventually join the network formally in 1965.

The station operated from a temporary studio housed at 1219 Richards Street in Downtown Vancouver, until its full-time studio facility at 7850 Enterprise Street in Burnaby was opened in 1962. Soon after the station&#x27;s launch, CHAN began installing relay transmitters across the province, and now reaches 96% of British Columbia. Through its over-the-air signal, CHAN also reaches an American audience in neighbouring Whatcom County, Washington.
In 1963, local entrepreneur Frank Griffiths, owner of radio station CKNW (980 AM), purchased CHAN-TV from Vantel, along with nearby CBC affiliate CHEK-TV (channel 6) in the Vancouver Island city of Victoria, from its original owner, David Armstrong. At that point, CHEK began airing a few CTV programs, usually scheduled at different times than when CHAN aired them. It would become a full-time CTV affiliate in January 1981, but maintained a shuffled schedule. Griffiths&#x27; Western Broadcasting Communications later sold a minority share of the station to Selkirk Communications, before buying back full control in 1989.

In 1986, BCTV set up a fully functional broadcast studio pavilion at the Vancouver Expo 86, whose theme was transportation and communication. The BCTV pavilion allowed visitors to see, and participate, in every step of how a television station operates, as well as how newscasts and television shows were produced. The pavilion was also used by the station for coverage of the Expo, and by visiting journalists.

As early as 1971, CHAN unofficially began using the brand &quot;BCTV&quot;. In 1973, BCTV became CHAN&#x27;s official on-air branding, which remained in use until 2001, when it adopted the &quot;Global BC&quot; brand. The &quot;BCTV&quot; brand was retained for its local newscasts until February 2006. However, the &quot;BCTV&quot; brand became so firmly established in the province that many people still call the station by that name today.

===Hostility to CTV===
CHAN was CTV&#x27;s third-largest affiliate, and by far the largest in Western Canada. As such, it was one of the backbones of the CTV network for many years and one of the network&#x27;s most successful affiliates. However, it was always somewhat hostile toward CTV. Management believed that the network&#x27;s flagship station, CFTO-TV in Toronto, had too much influence over the network. In particular, CHAN felt CFTO received favouritism in the production of CTV&#x27;s Canadian programming in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Nonetheless, until 1997, CHAN bought the provincial rights to several popular series from CFTO&#x27;s parent company, Baton Broadcasting. However, tensions were exacerbated that year when Baton won a licence to operate a new television station in Vancouver, CIVT-TV (channel 32), and immediately moved much of CHAN&#x27;s stronger programs there. Baton won controlling interest in CTV soon after channel 32&#x27;s launch, and it became an open secret that CIVT would eventually replace CHAN as the CTV station for the Vancouver market.

CHAN had signed a long-term contract with CTV several years earlier that would not expire until 1999, but was extended to 2001. However, the sign-on of CIVT meant that CHAN could only air CTV&#x27;s base schedule of 40 hours of programming per week. The station had to fill the schedule with its local newscasts and lower-profile programming supplied by parent company Western International Communications. A small amount of CHUM Limited-produced programs also aired on CHAN at times during the period from 1997 to 2001, including &quot;CityLine&quot;.

===The affiliation shakeup of 2001===

On June 6, 2000 WIC&#x27;s stations were purchased by Canwest Global Communications, which owned the Global Television Network. As a result, CHAN was due to become the Global outlet for all of British Columbia. Although Global already owned a station in Vancouver, CKVU-TV (channel 10), it opted to sell CKVU to CHUM Limited and move its affiliation to CHAN. By this time, CHAN operated a network of over 100 transmitters covering almost all of the province, and had been the province&#x27;s dominant news station for three decades. In contrast, CKVU operated only three transmitters covering the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.

CHAN-TV&#x27;s affiliation agreement with CTV expired on September 1, 2001, sparking a major shakeup in British Columbia television:
*The CTV affiliation, jointly held by CHAN and sister station CHEK, moved to CIVT, which became a CTV O&amp;O station that branded for a short time as &quot;BC CTV&quot; (later revised to &quot;CTV British Columbia&quot;). Both switches left CTV dependent on cable and satellite coverage to reach the rest of the province, as CTV has refused to set up rebroadcasters in the rest of the province. CHAN retained the rights to &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, which was carried by CTV in all of its other O&amp;O markets, until the talk show ended its run in 2011.
*The Global affiliation, held by CKVU, moved to CHAN, which became the network&#x27;s new O&amp;O under the &quot;Global BC&quot; brand. CKVU meanwhile adopted the &quot;ckvu13&quot; brand and briefly became an independent station carrying CHUM-supplied programming, some of which had aired the previous season on KVOS-TV (channel 12) in Bellingham, Washington. The station became a Citytv owned-and-operated station (the eventual television system-turned-network&#x27;s first expansion outside of Toronto) several months later, after the sale to CHUM was approved.
*Most of CHAN&#x27;s former WIC-supplied programming, which migrated to Canwest&#x27;s newly launched CH system, moved to CHEK (where other WIC programs already aired). The station was rebranded &quot;CH Vancouver Island&quot;; it was later renamed &quot;CHEK News&quot; in 2007 as part of CH&#x27;s rebranding to E! and to simply &quot;CHEK&quot; in 2009 following the demise of the E! system.
*Religious station CHNU (channel 10; later a Joytv station, now an independent station), launched two weeks later, and a CHUM-owned NewNet station in Victoria, CIVI-TV (channel 53), launched just over two weeks after that.

==Programming==
For the most part, CHAN does not deviate much from the Global schedule. Some programs carried on Global&#x27;s daytime schedule in other markets – primarily library programs from Corus Entertainment&#x27;s specialty channels – are not cleared on CHAN in order to make room for the station&#x27;s various local news programs.

In February, the station broadcasts the annual Variety &quot;Show of Hearts&quot; telethon.

===Selected former non-network programs===
* Vancouver based &quot;NWA All Star Wrestling&quot; (1962–1989) 
* &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, aired weeknights at 12:37 a.m. from February 1994 to August 1995
* &quot;280-JOCK&quot; followed &quot;News Hour Final&quot; at 12:05 a.m. until it was cancelled in late 1994, which pushed back &quot;Late Show&quot; to 12:37 a.m. for several months.
* &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, aired weeknights at 12:07 a.m. from August 1995 to August 2001
*As CHUM Limited held the rights to this program throughout the rest of the country, when CIVI-TV launched in nearby Victoria, British Columbia, the broadcast rights transferred over to that station.
*&quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; (1986–2011) aired at 4 p.m. on CHAN because the station owned the provincial television rights to this show, dating back to its days as a CTV affiliate. In every other market in which CTV owned a station, that network owned the local rights to &quot;Oprah&quot;.

===News operation===
CHAN-DT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and five hours on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among Global&#x27;s television stations (either owned-and-operated or affiliated), as well as among all Canadian television stations (after the drastic reduction of Hamilton, Ontario&#x27;s CHCH-DT total weekly news programming due to budget cuts in December 2015).

The station&#x27;s Burnaby studios also serve as the production facilities for Global&#x27;s Vancouver-based English national evening newscast &quot;Global National&quot; and the Shaw Multicultural Channel Mandarin national evening newscast &quot;Global National Mandarin&quot; (2012–2016). Unlike most Global stations that carry midday newscasts, CHAN airs its noon newscast seven days a week.

The station&#x27;s newscast schedule is very similar to that of an affiliate of the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) in the United States, although as Global lacks a national morning news program, CHAN&#x27;s weekday morning newscast runs a length similar to that of many Fox and other news-producing non-Big Three U.S. stations.

CHAN&#x27;s news operation is well respected in the industry. Ever since the station first aired an hour-long newscast in the 1960s, a major part of the station&#x27;s cash flow has gone into its news department, and it has garnered high ratings and major awards since then. The station&#x27;s 6 p.m. &quot;News Hour&quot; broadcast has been the highest-rated local newscast in the province for many years, as well as the most-watched in all of Canada.

The station&#x27;s on-air news style was even used as an inspiration for Ted Turner&#x27;s CNN, as both use the newsroom as a backdrop during the broadcast. The current newsroom was constructed in 1975; it was rebuilt in the early 1990s, moving the studio out of the newsroom, but keeping it as a backdrop, and was later remodeled in 2001 and 2006.

Starting in the early 1990s, CHAN harboured ambitions of producing an early evening national newscast from its studios. In fact, several newscast pilots were produced at CHAN, suggesting the network was seriously considering such a move. However, that newscast never materialized; instead, CHAN began producing &quot;Canada Tonight&quot;, which aired on most WIC-owned stations beginning in 1993.

Two versions were produced: one for British Columbia itself, hosted by CKNW radio commentator Bill Good (who later went to CTV&#x27;s current Vancouver O&amp;O station, CIVT-TV, and retired in December 2010) and a national version, hosted by Tony Parsons, who also anchored CHAN&#x27;s nightly news program, the &quot;News Hour&quot;. When Canwest purchased CHAN, the stories that were once sourced from CTV&#x27;s other affiliates throughout the country were replaced by stories sourced from Global&#x27;s affiliates.

From 2001, when the station became &quot;Global BC&quot;, the news department underwent a minor retitling as &quot;BCTV News on Global&quot;. CHAN opted to keep the &quot;BCTV&quot; name for its newscasts, since that brand was still very well respected in the province; it also wanted to keep CIVT from using the name itself, as it contained the letters &quot;CTV&quot;. In addition, CHAN became the headquarters for Global&#x27;s national news centre and the production facility for a new national newscast, &quot;Global National&quot; (which is currently anchored by former CTV and NBC correspondent Dawna Friesen on weeknights and on weekends by Robin Gill; originally anchored beforehand by Kevin Newman), thus fulfilling its longstanding dream of producing a national newscast. The program is broadcast live-to-tape from Vancouver at 5:30 p.m. (Pacific Time Zone), airing locally prior to the 6 p.m. &quot;News Hour&quot; broadcast.

The &quot;BCTV&quot; brand was finally discontinued when Global introduced its new logo and on-air identity on February 6, 2006; CHAN&#x27;s newscasts were rebranded as &quot;Global News&quot; (with its overall branding changing to &quot;Global BC&quot;) at this point. In 2006, Global struck an agreement with the Canadian Traffic Network to supply the station with a Robinson R44 news helicopter with gyroscopic camera mounts. The helicopter is branded as &quot;Global 1&quot; – the same designation used for the news helicopters used by other Global stations – which is shared with CKNW, and is the second news helicopter in Vancouver (after that used by CIVT).

On December 16, 2009, Tony Parsons anchored his final newscast at CHAN after 34 years as anchor of the &quot;News Hour&quot;. It was expected that he would remain until after the 2010 Winter Olympics, but left much earlier than expected for unknown reasons. Parsons joined CHEK as anchor of its 10 p.m. newscast on March 15, 2010, and also began anchoring the evening newscasts at CBC Television O&amp;O CBUT (channel 2) on April 12, 2010, remaining at both stations until his retirement in 2013.

CHAN began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition on September 20, 2010 (Dawna Friesen was named anchor of &quot;Global National&quot; on that same date); the station debuted a new graphics package as well as an HD-ready virtual set two weeks later on October 4, which utilized the same set with minor changes to the desk. CHAN-DT uses Betacam SP analogue videotape for all of its local advertisements and for pre-recorded segments within its newscasts; however, the station is slowly moving to a digital format for video production. MPEG-2 transmission is used on nearly all non-local broadcasts.

On January 11, 2012, Shaw Media filed a license application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) – which was approved on July 20, 2012 – to launch a Category B digital-only specialty service that would serve as a British Columbia-focused news channel operated by CHAN-DT and utilizing its news staff. The channel, which was given the name Global News: BC 1, launched on March 14, 2013. It became the fourth regional news channel in Canada and the first outside of Ontario (joining Toronto-based 24-hour services CP24 and the now-defunct City&quot;News Channel&quot;, and Hamilton-based independent station – and former CHAN sister station under their prior Canwest ownership – CHCH-DT, which carries a heavy local newscast schedule along with some entertainment programming).

On August 27, 2012, CHAN-DT expanded its weekday morning newscast to four hours, with the addition of a half-hour at 5 a.m. (making it only the second Canadian station with a pre-5:30 a.m. morning newscast, after CHCH-DT), the 5 to 6 a.m. hour of the newscast was re-titled as the &quot;Early Morning News&quot;; in addition on September 2, 2012, the station also expanded its Sunday morning newscast to three hours with the addition of an hour at 7 a.m. The expansions of CHAN&#x27;s morning newscasts were part of a benefits package that was included as a condition of the sale of the Global Television Network to Shaw Communications.

Since August 19, 2024, due to cutbacks by Corus, the newscasts of Kelowna sister station CHBC-DT have been hubbed from CHAN-DT. The newscasts feature contributions from local reporters.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CHAN has been broadcasting in digital since April 11, 2008, on UHF channel 22. On June 29, 2011, CHAN-DT increased its effective radiated power (ERP) from 8.3 kW to its post-transitional allotment of 40 kW. CHAN&#x27;s primary Vancouver transmitter was the station&#x27;s only one required to go digital by the transition deadline.

CHAN shut down its analogue signal, over VHF channel 8, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22, using virtual channel 8. The station&#x27;s electronic program guide began functioning properly on January 28, 2012.

On October 15, 2012, CHAN-DT&#x27;s transmitters in Kelowna, Penticton and Vernon were converted to digital signals. These were the station&#x27;s first rebroadcast transmitters to be converted to digital as part of Shaw&#x27;s efforts to convert all of its television transmitters to digital by 2016.

===Transmitters===
Note that the transmitters in Kelowna and the surrounding area (CHKL-TV) are &quot;in addition&quot; to CHBC-DT, a co-owned separate Global station in Kelowna that originates its own local evening newscasts, but which carries Global BC&#x27;s programming at virtually all other times. CHAN is the last owned-and-operated station of the three major Canadian broadcast networks (CBC, CTV and Global) in the Vancouver market to still operate rebroadcasters throughout most of the province.

<text>Australia has sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games, as well as every Winter Olympics except 1924–32 and 1948. In 1908 and 1912
Australia competed with New Zealand under the name Australasia.

==History==
Australia has been represented at every Summer Olympics. New Zealander Leonard Cuff, an athletics administrator, organised with both Baron Pierre de Coubertin and head of the English Amateur Athletics Federation Charles Herbert, for Australasia to be represented at the first International Olympic Committee meetings in 1894. While it was initially thought that no Australian (or New Zealand) athlete would be able to compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics, Edwin Flack, an Australian accountant and amateur athlete working in London, was able to obtain leave and travelled to Athens, where he won Gold in the 800 and 1500 metres, representing Australia. Australia and New Zealand were represented by Australasia at the IOC until 1920, although the two nations competed as individual entities at the 1908 and 1912 games. From 1920 onwards, they competed as separate nations. 

Australia became the first country in the Southern Hemisphere to host the games, hosting the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, before hosting the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Australia is due to host the Summer Olympics for the third time at the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane. 

While Australia had frequently overachieved at the Summer Olympic Games, this came to a halt at the 1976 Olympic Games. After winning at least five gold medals and seventeen total medals at every Olympics since 1956, Australia won zero gold medals and only five medals in total. This was the first time Australia had not won Gold since the 1936 Summer Olympics. It caused an uproar in Australia, and the government-funded Australian Institute of Sport was subsequently founded in 1981. Since the formation of the AIS, Australia has finished with less than 20 medals only once, in 1988, and has won at least three gold medals at every Summer Olympics since, holding an average of 11 gold medals per Games.

While Australia has focused largely on the Summer Olympics, Australia has been represented at the Winter Olympics since 1936 with Ken Kennedy the first Australian Winter Olympian and sole representative. Kennedy competed in the Speed skating in all four events, with a best finish of 29th in the 500 metres. It would take until 1952 for the next representatives, starting an unbroken attendance streak. Despite this long history, it took until the 1994 Winter Olympics to win its first medal: Bronze in the Men&#x27;s 5000 metre relay. After Zali Steggall won Australia&#x27;s first individual medal in the Women&#x27;s Slalom at the 1998 Winter Olympics, the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia was founded, leading to Australia&#x27;s first Winter Olympic gold medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics with Steve Bradbury winning the Men&#x27;s 1000 metres and Alisa Camplin winning the Women&#x27;s aerials.

=== Timeline of participation ===

=== Australia at the Winter Olympics ===


=== Medals by summer sport ===

=== Medals by winter sport ===

These totals do not include 11 medals recognised by the Australian Olympic Committee: 10 medals (3 gold, 4 silver and 3 bronze) won by Australians competing for the combined Australasia team in 1908 and 1912 (8 by individuals, 1 by an exclusively Australian team and 1 by a combined team) and 1 bronze medal won in tennis by Edwin Flack in 1896. The AOC therefore recognises Australia as having won 611 medals at the Summer Olympics (185 gold, 196 silver and 230 bronze).

== Medals by individual ==

This is a list of people who have won at least three Olympic gold medals for Australia, based upon data from the International Olympic Committee. Medals won in the 1906 Intercalated Games are not included. It includes top-three placings in 1896 and 1900, before medals were awarded for top-three placings.

* People in bold are still active competitors

Dale Begg-Smith and Torah Bright are the most successful Australian athletes at the Winter Olympics, with one gold medal and one silver each (Steven Bradbury, Alisa Camplin, and Lydia Lassila all won one gold and one bronze medal). Emma McKeon is the most prolific athlete at a single games, winning 7 medals (4 gold, 3 bronze) at the 2020 Olympics. While Lauren Jackson never won a gold medal, she is the only Australian to win medals in five different Olympics.

==Summary by sport==

=== Swimming ===

Australia first competed in swimming at the 1900 Games, with Frederick Lane competing in two events and winning gold medals in both. The sport would become a strength of the nation, which (as of the 2024 Games) has the second-most gold and second-most total medals behind the United States.

===Athletics===

Australia first competed in athletics at the inaugural 1896 Games, with 1 athlete (Edwin Flack) competing in 3 events and winning two of them.

===Canoeing===

As of the 2024 Games, half of Australia’s gold medals in canoeing have been won by sisters Jessica Fox and Noemie Fox.

=== Cycling ===
=== Rowing ===
=== Sailing ===
=== Skateboarding ===
Keegan Palmer won a gold medal - Australia’s first skateboarding medal in the Men’s Park event at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. At the 2024 Paris Olympics both Keegan Palmer and Arisa Trew both won gold at the respective Men and Women’s Park events.

===Tennis===

Australia first competed in tennis at the inaugural 1896 Games, with one player competing in men&#x27;s singles and, as part of a mixed team, in men&#x27;s doubles. Edwin Flack lost in the first round of the singles, but paired with George S. Robertson to earn bronze in the doubles. The mixed team medal is not credited to Australia. The first tennis gold medal won by Australia was by the Woodies in men&#x27;s doubles in 1996; the pair also won Australia&#x27;s only silver medal in the sport four years later. In 2024, Matthew Ebden and John Peers won the men&#x27;s doubles, providing Australia with its second gold medal in tennis.

<text>Lithgow is a town in the Central Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia and is the administrative centre of the City of Lithgow local government area. It is located in a mountain valley named Lithgow&#x27;s Valley by John Oxley in honour of William Lithgow.

Lithgow is on the Great Western Highway, about west of Sydney, or via the old mountain route, Bells Line of Road, from Windsor. At June 2021 Lithgow had an urban population of 11,197.
Lithgow is surrounded by a varied landscape characterised by seven valleys which include national parks, one of which, the Blue Mountains National Park, is a World Heritage Area. The Wollemi National Park is home to the Jurassic-age tree the Wollemi Pine, which was found growing in a remote canyon in the park.

==Location==

The city sits on the western edge of the sandstone country of the Blue Mountains and is usually considered the first true country town west of Sydney. Immediate surrounding areas include the old mining hamlet of Vale of Clwydd and Oakey Park, a famous iron and steel village, of which fiery night scenes have been depicted in many paintings, as well as large areas of bush and state forest. The next city to the west is Bathurst, away.

Lithgow is in the NSW State electorate of Bathurst, while federally it is part of electorate of Calare. Lithgow is the western terminus for the electric section of the Main Western railway line from Sydney. It is home to the Zig Zag Railway.

==History==

The mountainous terrain of the Blue Mountains and the expense of building long tunnels required the construction of the Lithgow Zig Zag between 1866 and 1869. The line was opened as far as Bowenfels, just to the west, in 1869, but Lithgow station was not opened until 1877. Although it was superseded in 1910 by more modern engineering methods, including ten tunnels, parts of the Zig Zag have been developed into a popular tourist attraction. Following a period of industrialisation in the late 1860s and 1870s, the town of Lithgow boomed during the 1880s, and it was incorporated as a borough in 1889.

The town situated in the centre of a coal mining district and there is one coal-powered power station nearby. It is the site of Australia&#x27;s first commercially viable steel mill, the ruins of which are open for inspection at &quot;Blast Furnace Park&quot;. Due to the abundance of coal and relative proximity to Sydney, in the areas surrounding Lithgow is one of the largest power stations in NSW, the Mount Piper Power Station. The Wallerawang Power Station closed in 2014 and was subsequently demolished. The Lithgow Power Station was operational from 1928 to 1964.

<doc id="937142" wikidata="Q1407706" url="?curid=937142" title="Darkover Landfall">
<text>Darkover Landfall is a science fiction novel in the &quot;Darkover&quot; series by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley. It was originally published in 1972 by DAW Books. It has since been republished several times and is included as part of the &quot;Darkover: First Contact&quot; omnibus. According to Bradley&#x27;s obituary, the events of this book take place at the end of the 21st century.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; concerns the crew and colonists of a spaceship that is forced to crash land on Cottman IV, an inhospitable planet in orbit around a red giant. The crew become accidental colonists when the ship loses contact with Earth and they realize rescue is impossible. The book introduces surnames, religious and cultural themes that echo throughout the &quot;Darkover&quot; series of books. This series spans millennia, as the ship&#x27;s descendants populate the world and develop unique cultures and psi abilities. Though &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; is not the first book written in the series, in the Darkover timeline its events are the beginning for all that follows.

==Reception==
Of this book, J. John Jones, writing for &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, notes that &quot;&quot;Landfall&quot; has been a disappointment for some women. I&#x27;ve read reviews by some feminist critics who have vilified the work, expecting something more radical, apparently, from a woman writer. I still find her ideas provocative. No doubt some women are offended by the roles of planned breeding that her women characters portrayed. Still, stimulating rage is one way to effect social change so you might suppose that her works still gave some impetus for social change even with the roles that her women characters portray in this imagined society&quot;.

==Major characters==
* Captain Harry Leicester
* Rafael MacAran, one of the ship&#x27;s officers
* Camilla Del Rey, one of the ship&#x27;s officers
* Ewen Ross, medical officer
* Judith Lovat, biologist
* Father Valentine, order of St. Christopher of Centaurus

<text>Stormqueen! is a science fantasy novel by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley, part of the &quot;Darkover&quot; series. Originally published in 1978, it was republished in 2002 as part of the &quot;Ages of Chaos&quot; omnibus.

&quot;Stormqueen!&quot; occurs two hundred years prior to &quot;Two To Conquer&quot;, in the period of Darkover&#x27;s history known as the Ages of Chaos. The underlying theme of &quot;Stormqueen!&quot; is a breeding program, undertaken over centuries, to produce stronger &quot;laran&quot; gifts, resulting in individuals like Dorilys and Allart, whose gifts are potentially lethal.

Though it is mentioned as an aside, this book contains the moment in the Darkovan timeline when the Ridenow of the Dry Towns overtake the Serrais domain, merging into Ridenow of Serrais.

==Plot summary==
Lady Aliciane of Rockraven, &quot;barragana&quot; to Mikhail of Aldaran, dies giving birth to a daughter, Dorilys. In childhood, Dorilys is discovered to have weather-related &quot;laran&quot;, causing storms and lightning with her childish temper tantrums.

Allart Hastur leaves Nevarsin Monastery, where he has lived for six years, learning to live with a form of &quot;laran&quot; that causes him to experience premonitions of multiple futures. He meets Cassandra Aillard, the woman his family intends him to marry. He believes that any children they might conceive will cause her death. To avoid this fate, they become celibate tower workers at Hali.

Lord Rakhal Aldaran of Scathfell arrives with his son at Castle Aldaran. Scathfell wishes ensure that his son Darren marries Dorilys, who is now eleven. At the handfasting, Darren judges her to be much older than he has been told, and attempts to force her into sexual relations. Dorilys&#x27; self-protective &quot;laran&quot; strikes Darren dead. Scathfell swears vengeance. Dorilys&#x27; half-brother Donal is sent to acquire assistance from Hali Tower for Dorilys.

Damon-Rafael Hastur of Elhalyn, Allart&#x27;s brother, arrives at Hali and asks him to undertake a diplomatic mission to Aldaran. Donal Delleray also arrives, asking assistance for Dorilys. Allart and Renata accompany Donal back to Aldaran.

After working with Dorilys for a day, Renata warns Aldaran that while Donal has weather-related &quot;laran&quot;, Dorilys has the gift in a lethal form. She also asserts that Dorilys has already used her ability three times to kill someone she feared.

Renata attempts to teach Dorilys control, over both her behavior and her &quot;laran&quot; abilities. She, Allart, Donal and Dorilys use gliders to reach the fire watch tower. Dorilys explains that she can see the past, present and future of the fire; that Donal has the same ability with storms. Renata learns that Dorilys has the ability to draw power from the magnetic fields of planet.

To circumvent demands made by his brother, Lord Aldaran betroths his daughter, Dorilys to her half-brother, Donal. Donal, who has fallen in love with Renata, objects, but cannot alter his foster-father&#x27;s will. Donal and Dorilys are married on Midwinter Night.

Allart uses his gift of seeing multiple futures, but is overcome by visions of death and destruction. He teleports his wife, Cassandra, from Hali Tower, for her protection. He is warned by workers at Hali that Damon-Rafael, his brother, will march on Aldaran, to claim Cassandra for himself.

About a week later, Rakhal of Scathfell, who has joined forces with Damon-Rafael Hastur, demands that Aldaran give over Dorilys to be married to one of Scathfell&#x27;s sons. When Aldaran refuses, the castle is besieged with laran-based weapons, including clingfire. Dorilys is able to avert the attack. After several more attacks, Lord Aldaran decides to use Dorilys&#x27; powers at full force against the attacking army, despite the warnings of Allart and the others.

Allart&#x27;s brother Damon-Rafael sends word demanding that Allart hand over Cassandra. After attempting to reason with his brother, Allart telepathically shows him the future he will bring to Darkover if he steals Cassandra and crowns himself king. Rather than be the cause of such a future, Damon-Rafael kills himself.

At the feast following the victory, Dorilys realizes that Donal does not love her; rather he is in love with Renata. Acting out of temper, she blasts Donal, killing him instantly. Renata gets Dorilys under control and drugs her. Renata seeks Donal in the Overworld, but instead meets Dorilys as she might have been, self-controlled and emotionally mature. Dorilys tells Renata she must never again awaken, that her power is too dangerous. Renata leaves the Overworld and creates a force field around Dorilys. Her body is interred at Hali.

In a later Darkover novel, &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, set some hundreds or thousands of years later, a delegation that goes to retrieve the Sword of Aldones from Hali sees &quot;behind a rainbow of colors... a bier where lay a woman&#x27;s body ... she had slept there or lain there in unchanging, incorruptible death for thousands of years&quot;.

<text>The National Day of Spain () is a national holiday held annually on 12 October. It is also traditionally and commonly referred to as the Día de la Hispanidad (Hispanicity, Spanishness Day), commemorating Spanish legacy worldwide, especially in Hispanic America.

The National Day of Spain is the day of celebration on which the Spanish people commemorate the country&#x27;s history, recognize and appreciate achievements, reconfirm their commitment to the nation&#x27;s future. The day celebrates unity and fraternity, and also shows Spain&#x27;s ties with the international community.

Spanish law declares 

National Day of Spain commemorates the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus for Spain on 12 October 1492. The date is a key point for Spain&#x27;s overseas influence and legacy to the world and to the Americas in particular. It symbolizes Spain&#x27;s vast, common heritage with today&#x27;s American countries, which made up the Spanish Empire, the first global power in world history.

12 October is also the official Spanish language day, the Feasts of both Our Lady of the Pillar and the Virgin of Zapopan as well as the Day of the Spanish Armed Forces.

12 October is also an official holiday in much of Hispanic America, though under varying names (Día de la Hispanidad, Día de la Raza, Día del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural, Día de la Resistencia Indígena, etc.). To varying degrees, these holidays celebrate the historical and cultural ties among Hispanic American countries, ties between them and Spain, and their common Hispanic and pre-Hispanic indigenous American heritage. Furthermore, on the second Monday in October, the United States celebrates Columbus Day/ Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day.

==Observance==

National Day of Spain is a holiday throughout the entire country, so all central (national) government&#x27;s and autonomous communities&#x27; (provincial) institutions and administration offices are closed on that day, as are banks and stores. National Day is celebrated in Spain through numerous public and private events organized throughout the country to praise the nation&#x27;s heritage, history, society and people. The festivity is also celebrated by Spanish communities worldwide. Solemn acts of tribute to the national flag take place at different locations in Spain and abroad. The most important by far is the one held in the capital, Madrid, along with the Armed Forces parade. Other tribute, cultural, religious and vindicative parades and demonstrations are also organized by participants from civil society across Spain.

==Origins and evolution==

The distant origin of the holiday is to be found in the Roman Catholic tradition of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s apparition &quot;in flesh and blood&quot; in Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza&#x27;s name under the Roman Empire) to Apostle Saint James the Greater in AD 40 where a temple was built by the river Ebro, the first in the world dedicated to the cult of Saint Mary. Pilgrimage to Zaragoza to venerate Our Lady of the Pillar started in the early 8th century. Together with Saint James in Compostela, the spirituality of Christians in the Iberian Peninsula has centered around Our Lady of the Pillar for centuries.

On 27 May 1642 the city of Zaragoza designated Our Lady of the Pillar as a symbol of Hispanidad (Hispanicity), and the date became a feast in commemoration of the appearance of La Virgen del Pilar in the city.

In 1730, Pope Clement XII allowed the feast of Our Lady of the Pillar to be celebrated all over the Spanish Empire from then on.

On 23 September 1892 the queen regent of Spain, Maria Christina of Austria, promulgated a Royal Decree in San Sebastián, as proposed by the Prime Minister, Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, declaring 12 October 1892 a national day in commemoration of the 4th centenary of the discovery of America.

The preamble of that decree states the government had &quot;considered appropriate to explore the position of all the American countries and Italy, as homeland of Columbus, to see if, by joint agreement, that commemoration could be vested with greater importance.&quot;

The preamble continues pointing out that &quot;most governments of America have already adhered to the idea in principle, like that of the United States as well as those of the Hispanic American republics, with few exceptions, maybe because of temporary circumstances, which shall probably not prevent an unanimous resolution, and, for its part, the Government of his S.M. the King of Italy has also welcomed the invitation in the most cordial and satisfactory way.&quot; It is further stressed the opportunity of &quot;perpetuating&quot; such a commemoration as a National Day of Spain.

Hispanicity was celebrated again in Spain from 1935, when the first festival was held in Madrid. The day was known as &quot;Día de la Hispanidad&quot; (&quot;Day of Hispanicity&quot;), emphasizing Spain&#x27;s connection to the international Hispanic community.
Hispanicity linked to the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar as historical background and symbol of the National Day of Spain are well expressed in a 1939 letter addressed by an Argentinian donor, Doña Soledad Alonso de Drysdale, to the Spanish government regarding the fundraising to complete the building of the last two of four towers of the Cathedral of the Pillar:

from the original:


In 1981, soon after the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, the national day is renamed &quot;Fiesta Nacional de España y Día de la Hispanidad&quot; by Royal Decree On 7 October 1987, the reference to Hispanidad is discarded and the name is changed again to &quot;Fiesta Nacional&quot;. 12 October became one of two national celebrations, along with Constitution Day on December 6.

Spain&#x27;s &quot;national day&quot; had moved around several times during the various regime changes of the 20th century. Establishing it on the day of the international Discovery of America celebration was part of a compromise between conservatives, who wanted to emphasize the status of the monarchy and Spain&#x27;s history, and the left-winged parties, who wanted to commemorate Spain&#x27;s burgeoning democracy with an official holiday. While the manifest ties of Spain with Hispanic America are not questioned, the removal of the Hispanidad from the name of the national festivity aims to avoid any controversy regarding the conquest, influence and rule of the Americas by Spain during the imperial period.

The participation of the Armed Forces in the celebration of National Day was established in 1997 by Royal Decree, which regulates the commemoration and tribute acts to be performed by the Armed Forces on National Day of Spain. It actually transfers the most relevant acts of the Armed Forces Day, traditionally celebrated separately in springtime, to 12 October. This measure aimed, on the one hand, to integrate in the same festivity all the historic and cultural elements of the Spanish nation, and on the other hand, to enhance the identification of the Armed Forces with the Spanish society whom they serve. Other civic-military events are also organized around 12 October, including military training and exhibitions, cultural and sport events, aiming to facilitate the citizens to get a better knowledge of the Armed Forces.

==Celebrations==

Public and civil society celebrations of the National Day are numerous and of different natures. Solemn Acts of Tribute to the National Flag take place in different locations of Spain. The most important is the one traditionally held in the capital, Madrid, along with the Armed Forces and State Security Forces parade. Other tribute and vindicative parades and demonstrations are also organized by figures from civil society across Spain.

While the reference to &#x27;Hispanidad&#x27; was removed from the official name of the festivity, the tradition of somehow celebrating this phenomenon is observed in Spain as it is celebrated by Hispanic peoples worldwide. Celebrations emphasizing the discovering of America and the pioneering efforts and contributions of Spain in America and to the world through centuries, from the world exploration to the Spanish influence and shaping of Hispanic American societies, are traditionally held.

Officially commemorated until 1987, &quot;Dia de la Hispanidad&quot; has continued to be spontaneously celebrated by Spanish people with both a cultural and a religious dimension. It celebrates Hispanic diversity, brotherhood, common heritage and cultural ties between Hispanic countries.

===Tribute to the Flag and Armed Forces Parade===
The celebration traditionally includes a parade of the Spanish Armed Forces (military) and the State Security Forces (law enforcement), usually held in Madrid, attended by high institutional and political representatives including the King of Spain, head of state and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, together with the Royal Family, the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the Cortes Generales and faction leaders of its chambers, and the President of the Supreme Court and General Council of the Judiciary, members of the cabinet, deputies and senators of the Cortes and other representatives of the central government and the governments of the autonomous communities of the state. Political and institutional delegations from other guest countries, including military forces participating in the parade, also attend the event. The parade expresses the commitment of the Armed and the State Security forces to society and their contribution to the wider international community. The parade is held in one of the capital&#x27;s big plazas, in recent parades the marching contingents are assigned the Paseo de la Castellana for the parade as a marching route.

The most important role is usually reserved for the Spanish flag. For several consecutive years, the Spanish Air Force aerobatics parachute demonstration unit has performed a jump carrying a massive Spanish flag to land in front of the Royal dais where the King, as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, who serves as the event&#x27;s chief guest of honor, is present together with the Queen and members of the Royal Family, the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Defense Staff. Then the tribute to the national flag follows, with its raising while the national anthem, the &quot;Marcha Real,&quot; is performed. Then, tribute is paid to the soldiers who gave their lives for Spain which is followed by a civil-military parade with mobile column and flypast segment, which usually includes a display by the Spanish Air and Space Force&#x27;s aerobatics team, the &quot;Patrulla Águila&quot;.

The Armed Forces Parade is one of the most widely attended events in Spain, with thousands of citizens gathering along the parade route, where they can show their affection to the Royal Family, Armed Forces and to the State Security forces as they march past the dais.

As for many other public events, the 2020 Armed Forces Parade was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country and substituted by a civil-military institutional act in the Royal Palace&#x27;s court where the Tribute to the Spanish flag could be paid followed by a short parade and a tribute to all actively fighting the pandemic.

The parade is broadcast by state-owned Televisión Española and is livestreamed online to millions around the world.

==== Expanded summary of the parade ====
At 9 am the Guardia Real&#x27;s Honours Battalion forms up at the front of the royal dais where members of the Cabinet, deputies and senators of the Cortes, federal and regional government representatives, military attaches and veterans are assembled. Formed up with the regimental band of the Guard in companies, the guards of honour, in full dress with shakos and rifles, await the arrival of the King and Queen.

At 10 am, in the presence of the Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and Chief of Defense Staff, the Royal Family arrives. As the &quot;Marcha Real&quot; is played by the Guard Band, the guard battalion presents arms and a 21-gun salute is fired. As the music ends, the guard battalion orders arms. After this, the guard commander informs the King that the guard battalion has been formed for the ceremonial segment of the ceremony, and the King and Queen inspects the guard of honour battalion to music by the band. As the music stops, the royal party takes its leave of the guard and proceeds to the dais to meet other representatives of the federal government and regional leaders. As the party returns the Chief of Defense Staff takes his leave to ask for permission to begin the parade and ceremony before returning to the dais.

Following this the Parachute Team of the Air and Space Forces performs a freefall jump on to the parade grounds.

===Spanish culture===

An expression of the rich cultural diversity of Spain, National Day is celebrated through numerous public and private events to praise the nation&#x27;s heritage, history, society and people. People dressed in traditional regional or historic costumes as well as folk, classical and modern music concerts and street shows are unavoidable features of the celebrations. Spanish American communities in Spain also participate in parades, displaying their national colors and their countries&#x27; typical garments marching along to the sound of their respective upbeat folk tunes.

12 October is an Open Doors Day in many museums and historical sites. 

For some years since 2010, Spanish Language Day was also celebrated on 12 October by the United Nations, but was later moved to 23 April to commemorate the anniversary of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; death on that day.

===Religious dimension===
The Spanish legacy has a strong religious component expressed with the traditional celebration of the Day of Our Lady of the Pillar, &quot;Mother of the Hispanic Peoples&quot; and very popular in Spain; and of the Our Lady of Guadalupe, &quot;Queen of the Hispanidad&quot; who enjoys a high popularity in Hispanic America, both festivities being held as well on 12 October.

Our Lady of the Pillar (la Virgen del Pilar) is patroness saint of both the autonomous community of Aragon and its capital, the city of Zaragoza as well as of the Guardia Civil (Spanish Civil Guard) and the Spanish Navy submarine force among others. It commemorates the coming of the Virgin Mary to Zaragoza in AD 40, according to tradition, her only apparition while she was still alive and the first to the Hispanic people. Since the religious feast day coincides with the discovery of the Americas (12 October 1492), Pope John Paul II praised El Pilar as &quot;Mother of the Hispanic Peoples&quot; during both his visits to the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar.

12 October, also popularly known in Spain as &quot;Día del Pilar&quot; (Day of the Pillar), attracts many people from other Spanish regions to Zaragoza, where the traditional &quot;Ofrenda de flores a la Virgen&quot; (Offering of flowers to the Virgin Mary), a massive parade with broad social participation, including from Hispanic American communities, takes place all day long. Every nation of Hispanic colonial origin has donated national vestments for the fifteenth-century statue of the Virgin, which is housed in the chapel of the cathedral.
Another relevant symbol of Hispanic heritage both in Spain and in Hispanic America is the cult of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which feast is celebrated in Extremadura on the Día de la Hispanidad, on 12 October each year, since she holds the title of Queen of Hispanicity since 1928. The origin of this religious tradition is the Christian legend of the apparition of the Blessed Mother to a shepherd in the 14th century indicating the place to find a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary carved by Luke the Evangelist buried centuries ago by local clergymen to prevent any damage of it from the Moorish invaders. The Monastery later built on the site where the statue was found soon became the most important place of pilgrimage in Castile and fair rich.

The Catholic Monarchs met in the Monastery with Columbus in June 1492, which resulted in the Monarchs&#x27; authorization of the exploration endeavor and the dispatch of the first Royal injunctions to organize the &quot;voyage into the unknown.&quot; In 1493, Columbus went back to the Monastery to thank Our Lady of Guadalupe for his successful first voyage. On his second, he baptized a newly found Caribbean island as Guadalupe, in honor to the Spanish Virgin. This, together with the fact that many Spanish explorers came from Extremadura, and the utmost popularity of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Castile, are the reason behind the spread of the worship throughout America and her canonical coronation as Queen of Hispanicity.

<doc id="937165" wikidata="Q2336057" url="?curid=937165" title="Gulgong">
<text>Gulgong is a 19th-century gold rush town in the Central Tablelands and the wider Central West regions of the Australian state of New South Wales. The town is situated within the Mid-Western Regional Council local government area. It is located about north west of Sydney, and about 30 km north of Mudgee along the Castlereagh Highway. At the , Gulgong had a population of .

Today, much of the 19th-century character of the town remains, contributing to its appeal as a tourist destination. Of special interest is the Prince of Wales Opera House, a survivor with a rich history.

An attraction of note is the &quot;Gulgong Pioneer Museum&quot;, which has a huge collection of thematically-displayed exhibits, ranging from kitchen utensils to complete buildings that have been relocated to a &quot;street&quot; on the site. Apart from tourism and hospitality, local industries include wine production, wool, wheat growing and coal mining.

Yarrobil National Park is located north west of Gulgong.

==History==
The name &quot;Gulgong&quot; is derived from the word used by the traditional inhabitants, the Wiradjuri, for &quot;deep waterhole&quot;.

Lieutenant William Lawson passed through the area in November 1820 and again in 1821 and reported good grazing land in the region. This prompted the brothers George and Henry Cox, sons of William Cox, to take up land to the south of the Gudgegong River, while Lawson applied for land grants to the north. Others soon followed, taking up land with river frontage along the Gudgegong. Among the first to take formal possession was Richard Rouse who was granted land in 1825 by Governor Brisbane.

Gulgong came into existence after gold was discovered at Red Hill in 1870. The township was surveyed in August 1870. By the end of that year there were 800 people on the diggings, which yielded over 32 tons of gold in the 1870s. The population had increased to 12,000 by the time the British author Anthony Trollope visited in October 1871.
The population of the town reached 20,000 in 1873. The Gulgong gold field was one of the last to be developed as &quot;poor man&#x27;s diggings&quot;, that is by individuals without substantial capital investment. During the height of the gold rush in the 1870s, Gulgong had 67 pubs (it now has four).

Novelist and bush poet Henry Lawson lived briefly in Gulgong as a child in the early 1870s, while his father sought instant wealth as a miner. A montage of goldrush-era Gulgong street scenes was used as a backdrop to the portrait of Lawson on the first Australian ten dollar note (which was in use from 1966 until replaced by a polymer banknote in November 1993). The town and its surrounding district feature in Lawson&#x27;s fiction, especially in &quot;Joe Wilson and His Mates&quot;.

Gulgong is believed to be one of the primary locations in Thomas Alexander Browne&#x27;s &quot;The Miner&#x27;s Right&quot; which he wrote under the pseudonym Rolf Boldrewood
. Australia&#x27;s first novelist of note, Browne was police magistrate in the period 1871-81 and many of his characters have been matched to Gulgong goldfields identities. He once hosted English author Anthony Trollope, who later recorded his impressions of Australia and New Zealand (1875).

In 1872, Henry Beaufoy Merlin took photographic images on glass-plate negatives of many buildings in Gulgong — with owners, tenants and passers-by — and of gold mines and miners, creating a unique record of life, in the town and its surroundings, at the time of the gold rushes. These images of Gulgong form part of the Holtermann Collection. 

A nearby area on the state register is known as the Talbragar fossil site, containing sometimes excellently preserved specimens of plants, fishes, invertebrates and a previously unknown spider. In addition, a site known as McGraths Flat about 25 miles northwest of Gulgong contains a recently discovered cache of Miocene era fossils.

<doc id="937167" wikidata="Q301691" url="?curid=937167" title="Common Romanian">
<text>Common Romanian (), also known as Ancient Romanian (), or Proto-Romanian (), is a comparatively reconstructed Romance language evolved from Vulgar Latin and spoken by the ancestors of today&#x27;s Romanians, Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, Istro-Romanians and related Balkan Latin peoples (Vlachs) between the 6th or 7th century AD and the 10th or 11th centuries AD. The evidence for this can be found in the fact that Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian share with each other their main language innovations comparative to Vulgar Latin on one hand, and distinctive from the other Romance languages on the other, according to Romanian linguist Marius Sala.

== History ==

The Roman occupation led to a Roman-Thracian syncretism, and similar to the case of other conquered civilisations (see, for example, how Gallo-Roman culture developed in Roman Gaul) led to the Latinization of many Thracian tribes which were on the edge of the sphere of Latin influence, eventually resulting in the possible extinction of the Daco-Thracian language, but traces of it are still preserved in the Eastern Romance substratum. From the 2nd century AD, the Latin spoken in the Danubian provinces starts to display its own distinctive features, separate from the rest of the Romance languages, including those of the western Balkans (Dalmatian). The Thraco-Roman period of the language is usually delimited between the 2nd century (or earlier via cultural influence and economic ties) and the 6th or the 7th century. It is divided, in turn, into two periods, with the division falling roughly in the 3rd to 4th century. The Romanian Academy considers the 5th century as the latest time that the differences between Balkan Latin and western Latin could have appeared, and that between the 5th and 8th centuries, the new language, Romanian, switched from Latin speech, to a vernacular Romance idiom, called . The nature of the contact between Latin and the substrate language(s) is considered to be similar to the contact with local languages in other parts incorporated in the Roman Empire and the number of lexical and morpho-syntactic elements retained from the substrate is relatively small despite some ongoing contact with languages closely related to the original substrate, Albanian for example.

In the ninth century, Proto-Romanian already had a structure very distinct from the other Romance languages, with major differences in grammar, morphology and phonology and already was a member of the Balkan language area. It already contained around a hundred loans from Slavic languages, including words such as (body, flesh), as well as some Greek language loans via Vulgar Latin, but no Hungarian and Turkish words, as these peoples had yet to arrive in the region.

In the tenth century or some earlier time, Common Romanian split into two geographically separated groups. One was in the northern part of the Balkan peninsula and the other one was in the south of the peninsula where the Aromanian branch of Common Romanian presumably was spoken. This is sometimes considered the upper end of the language, leading into the separate Eastern Romance languages period. A different view holds that Common Romanian, despite the early split of Aromanian, continued to exist until the thirteenth or fourteenth century when all the southern dialects became distinct from the northern one. 

According to the theory, it evolved into the following modern languages and their dialects:
* Romanian language (sometimes called Daco-Romanian to distinguish it from the rest of the Eastern Romance languages)
* Aromanian (sometimes called Macedo-Romanian)
* Megleno-Romanian (also sometimes called Macedo-Romanian)
* Istro-Romanian

== Early attestation ==

Referring to this time period, of great debate and interest is the so-called episode. In Theophylactus Simocatta Histories, ( 630), the author mentions the words . The context of this mention is a Byzantine expedition during Maurice&#x27;s Balkan campaigns in 587, led by general Comentiolus, in the Haemus, against the Avars. The success of the campaign was compromised by an incident during a night march:

Nearly two centuries after Theophylactus, the same episode is retold by another Byzantine chronicler, Theophanes Confessor, in his Chronographia ( 810–814). He mentions the words [; &quot;turn, turn brother&quot;]:

The first to identify the excerpts as examples of early Romanian was Johann Thunmann in 1774. Since then, a debate among scholars had been going on to identify whether the language in question is a sample of early Romanian, or just a Byzantine command (of Latin origin, as it appears as such–&quot;torna&quot;–in Emperors Mauricius Strategikon), and with used as a colloquial form of address between the Byzantine soldiers. The main debate revolved around the expressions ( – Theopylactus) and ( – Theophanes), and what they actually meant.

An important contribution to the debate was Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s first noticing in 1905 of the duality of the term in Theophylactus text: the shouting to get the attention of the master of the animal (in the language of the country), and the misunderstanding of this by the bulk of the army as a military command (due to the resemblance with the Latin military command). Iorga considers the army to have been composed of both auxiliary () Romanised Thracians—speaking (the &quot;language of the country&quot;/&quot;language of their parents/of the natives&quot;) —and of Byzantines (a mélange of ethnicities using Byzantine words of Latin origin as official command terms, as attested in the Strategikon).

This view was later supported by the Greek historian A. Keramopoulos (1939), as well as by Alexandru Philippide (1925), who considered that the word should not be understood as a solely military command term, because it was, as supported by chronicles, a word &quot;of the country&quot;, as by the year 600, the bulk of the Byzantine army was raised from barbarian mercenaries and the Romanic population of the Balkan Peninsula.

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, many Romanian scholars consider it a sample of early Romanian language, a view with supporters such as Al. Rosetti (1960), Petre Ș. Năsturel (1956) and I. Glodariu (1964).

In regards to the Latin term (an imperative form of the verb ), in modern Romanian, the corresponding or descendant term now means &quot;pour&quot; (a conjugated form of the verb – &quot;to pour&quot;). However, in older or early Romanian, the verb also had the sense of &quot;to return or come back&quot;, and this sense is also still preserved in the modern Aromanian verb and in some derived words in modern Romanian (for example: &quot;înturna&quot; &quot;return, turn&quot;, &quot;răsturna&quot; &quot;turn over, knock down&quot;)

== Development == 

=== From Latin ===

The comparative analysis of Romance languages shows that certain changes that occurred from Latin to Common Romanian are particular to it or shared only with a limited number of other Romance languages. Some of these changes are:
*reorganization of the Latin vowel system - Common Romanian followed a mixed scheme, with the back vowels following the Sardinian scheme but the front vowels following the Western Romance scheme. This produces a six-vowel system (contrast the Sardinian five-vowel system and Western Romance seven-vowel system).
*resistance to palatalization:
**the palatalization of , which appeared as early as the 2nd–3rd centuries AD, resulted in or in intervocalic position and as in word-initial position or after a consonant, without giving rise to a new phoneme.
**the palatalization before a front vowel ( before ), dated around the fifth century in general, did not occur around this time in Common Romanian (and Dalmatian), and took place after the delabialization of ( &lt; ), the degemination of , , , and the diphthongization of Proto-Romance to .
*the surviving diphthong was retained and later underwent diaeresis.
*resistance to syncope - Common Romanian kept all the syllables from the Latin word.
*absence of lenition - it retained the intervocalic stops intact. It also showed greater conservatism toward deletion.

==== Common features to the four dialects ====

Collectively described as languages of the Eastern Romance subgroup from a synchronic, contemporary perspective Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian are descendants of the same proto-language from a historical, diachronic point of view.

Of the features that are found in all four dialects, inherited from Latin or subsequently developed, of particular importance are:

* appearance of the mid central vowel (written as &quot;ă&quot; in standardized Romanian);
* growth of the plural inflectional ending &quot;-uri&quot; for the neuter gender;
* analytic present conditional (ex: Daco-Romanian &quot;aș cânta&quot;);
* analytic future with an auxiliary derived from Latin &quot;volo&quot; (ex: Aromanian &quot;va s-cãntu&quot;);
* enclisis of the definite article (ex. Istro-Romanian &quot;câre – cârele&quot;);
* nominal declension with two case forms in the singular feminine.
Comparatively, the dialects show a large number of loanwords from Slavic languages, including loanwords from Slavic languages spoken before the 9th century, at the stage before Aromanian, Daco-Romanian, and Megleno-Romanian separated. Of these words a few examples are:
* *bōrzdà (Aromanian: &quot;brazdã&quot;, Daco-Romanian: &quot;brazdă&quot;, Istro-Romanian: &quot;bråzda&quot;, Megleno-Romanian: &quot;brazdă&quot;);
* *nevěsta (Aromanian: &quot;niveastã&quot;, Daco-Romanian: &quot;nevastă&quot;, Istro-Romanian: &quot;nevęstę&quot;, Megleno-Romanian: &quot;niveastă&quot;);
* *sìto (Aromanian: &quot;sitã&quot;, Daco-Romanian: &quot;sită&quot;, Istro-Romanian: &quot;sitę&quot;, Megleno-Romanian: &quot;sită&quot;);
* *slàbъ (Aromanian: &quot;s(c)lab&quot;, Daco-Romanian: &quot;slab&quot;, Istro-Romanian: &quot;slåb&quot;, Megleno-Romanian: &quot;slab&quot;).

Substrate words are preserved at different levels in the four dialects. Daco-Romanian has 89, Aromanian 66. Megleno-Romanian 48, and Istro-Romanian 25.

<text>Senglea ( ), also known by its title Città Invicta (or Civitas Invicta), is a fortified city in the South Eastern Region of Malta. It is one of the Three Cities in the Grand Harbour area, the other two being Cospicua and Vittoriosa, and has a population of approximately 2,720 people. The city&#x27;s title Città Invicta (lit. invincible city) was given because it managed to resist the Ottoman invasion at the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. The name Senglea comes from the Grand Master who built it Claude de la Sengle and gave the city a part of his name. While Senglea is the 52nd most populated locality on the island, due to its incredibly small land area, it is the 2nd most densely populated locality after Sliema.

In Senglea, locals speak the Cottonera dialect.

Senglea was part of a town named Birmula. When the order of St John came to Malta they planned to build 3 cities from this land. It started from Senglea, then Vittoriosa and Cospicua. The rest of the land was named Cottonera and it was surrounded with the Cottonera lines.

==History ==
During the time of the Knights of St. John, Senglea was also used as a hunting area, and was known as &quot;L&#x27;Isola di San Giuliano&quot;.

In 1311 St. Julian&#x27;s church or chapel was founded in Isola. This was the first building to be constructed on what later became Senglea. On 8 May 1552 the foundation stone of Fort St. Michael was laid. Work on the fort, which was designed by Architect Pedro Pardo, was completed in 1553. Construction of walled town Senglea took place during the following decade. The area, which had until the 1550s been known as Isola di San Giuliano or Isola di San Michele, was given city status by Grand Master Claude De La Sengle and was named after him.

Senglea played an important role in the Great Siege of Malta in 1565 and remained unconquered. The city was given the title &quot;Civitas Invicta&quot; (meaning &quot;Unconquered City&quot;) by Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette. In 1581 Senglea became a Parish dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady. The donation of the statue of Our Lady, popularly known as &quot;Il-Bambina&quot;, is estimated to have occurred in 1618. Thousands of inhabitants of the city were killed in a plague epidemic in 1676.

In 1798, Senglea was involved in the blockade against French forces, who were ousted from Malta in 1800. The city narrowly escaped being hit by another plague in 1813; a statue of Our Lady was erected in the city&#x27;s centre as a sign of gratitude.

The parish church was bestowed with the title of Basilica by Pope Benedict XV in 1921. Senglean-born Ignazio Panzavecchia was elected as the first Prime Minister of Malta in the first Self Government Constitution in the same year. Because of his ecclesiastical status he decided not to take up the position. Following Panzavecchia&#x27;s refusal Joseph Howard was appointed as Prime Minister.

During the Second World War Senglea suffered heavy bombardments which devastated most of the city and killed many of its citizens. On 16 January 1941 a blitz by the Luftwaffe on HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, docked at the nearby Corradino, caused 21 fatalities and destroyed most of the city&#x27;s buildings including the Basilica. King George VI visited the devastated city on 20 June 1943.

The newly built Basilica was consecrated by Archbishop Sir Mikiel Gonzi on 24 August 1957. The following day the Basilica resumed its normal functions after almost 16 years and the statue of Marija Bambina was placed inside its new &quot;temple&quot; amongst huge celebrations.

Pope John Paul II visited Senglea in May 1990. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Luftwaffe bombing of the city, a monument which honours the local victims of both World Wars was unveiled besides the Basilica on 5 September 1991. The first Local Council of Senglea was formed after an election on 3 March 1994. The first mayor of the city was Stephen Perici.

The Italian city of Cassino became a twin city with Senglea in 2003. In 2010 Senglea won a European Destinations of Excellence award for aquatic tourism.

==Culture==
Senglea is particularly famous for the statue of Jesus Christ the Redeemer (&quot;Ir-Redentur tal-Isla&quot;), located in the oratory of the basilica which is dedicated to the birth of the Virgin Mary (&quot;Marija Bambina&quot;).

Senglea also has a statue dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus, which is often referred to as &quot;Il-Madonna tan-Nofs&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Our Lady of the Centre&quot;. It was originally erected in the city centre during the time of the plague, as gratitude, for being the only town not contaminated.

The local band club is currently named &quot;Socjeta&#x27; Filarmonika La Vincitrice&quot;. The city&#x27;s semi-professional football team Senglea Athletic was formed in 1934 to replace the defunct Senglea United side.

==Population==
With an area of just over half a square mile, Senglea is Malta&#x27;s smallest locality. It is also its most densely populated. Around the start of the 20th century, Senglea had more than 8200 people, making it the most densely populated town in Europe. At the time, Senglea, as well as Cospicua, were the centre of Malta&#x27;s elite and intelligentsia. The Second World War rapidly altered its social structure as many left to take refuge in outlying towns and countryside, never to return. In recent years, rehabilitation of the Cottonera Waterfront as a yacht marina has spurred a lot of interest from foreign expatriates and businessmen. A March 2011 estimate put its population at 2,964. Its population stood at 2,821 as of March 2013, and this decreased to 2,784 in March 2014.

==Transport==
Senglea is linked to the capital city of Valletta by a network of bus services. Prior to their introduction in the early 20th century, the cities were connected by boat services. In July 2011, following the introduction of a new bus network by Arriva, boats between the two locations were restarted in response to complaints that bus journeys were too slow.

<doc id="937170" wikidata="Q458299" url="?curid=937170" title="Walgett, New South Wales">
<text>Walgett is a town in northern New South Wales, Australia, and the seat of Walgett Shire. It is near the junctions of the Barwon and Namoi Rivers and the Kamilaroi and Castlereagh Highways. In 2016, Walgett had a population of 2,145.

In the 2016 census, there were 6,107 people in the Walgett Local Government Area. Of these 52.9% were male and 47.1% were female. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 29.4% of the population. Walgett takes its name from an Aboriginal word meaning &#x27;the meeting place of two rivers&#x27;. The town was listed as one of the most socially disadvantaged areas in the State according to the 2015 Dropping Off The Edge report.

==History==

The area was inhabited by the Gamilaroi (also spelt Kamilaroi) nation of Indigenous peoples before European settlement.

Yuwaalayaay (also known as &quot;Yuwalyai, Euahlayi, Yuwaaliyaay, Gamilaraay, Kamilaroi, Yuwaaliyaayi&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuwaalayaay country. It is closely related to the Gamilaraay and Yuwaalaraay languages. The Yuwaalayaay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Balonne, including the town of Dirranbandi as well as the border town of Goodooga extending to Walgett and the Narran Lakes in New South Wales.&quot;&quot;

A post office was gazetted for &quot;Wallgett on the Barwin River&quot; in 1851 and the town sites were surveyed in 1859. The district would have been occupied prior to this by squatters and their livestock.
The town of Walgett was proclaimed on 20 March 1885. The surveyor Arthur Dewhurst mapped the town, naming three streets after British Prime Ministers: Fox (main street—Castlereagh Highway), Pitt and Peel. Arthur Street was named after another surveyor. Walgett Courthouse was built in 1865.

Walgett was a port in the late 19th century for paddle steamers that plied the Murray-Darling river system. The first steamer reached Walgett in 1861 and travelled to the town regularly until c.1870.

Euroka Station, 10 miles (16 km) south of the town on the Castlereagh Highway, was purchased by Fred Wolseley in 1876 and was the site of the invention of the Wolseley Shearing Machine. The machine was tested at Bourke in 1888 on 184,000 sheep and eventually revolutionised the shearing industry.

Walgett&#x27;s history includes the Freedom Rides in the mid-1960s. The Freedom Riders, consisting in the main of Sydney university students, including Charles Perkins, arrived in Walgett on 15 February 1965. They protested outside the Walgett RSL Club because they had been told the club was refusing to admit Indigenous ex-servicemen. They also picketed a ladies&#x27; dress shop (Sheehan&#x27;s), protesting the fact that the proprietor would not allow Indigenous women to try on dresses. After their protests the Freedom Riders left town and headed for Narrabri, when a short distance from Walgett their bus was allegedly forced off the road by a car driven by a local farmer. This event led to Walgett, the Freedom Riders and the plight of Indigenous Australians receiving national and international media attention.

==Population==

According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 2,145 people in Walgett.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 43.4% of the population. 
* 81.0% of people were born in Australia and 84.3% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were Anglican 31.4%, Catholic 26.7% and No Religion 19.9%.

==Climate==

Walgett has a hot, semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) with hot to very hot summers and mild to cool winters with occasional frosts. Summer temperatures frequently rise above , and a maximum temperature of was recorded on 3 January 1903, which is one of the hottest temperatures recorded in the state. The annual rainfall is fairly low, at which falls fairly evenly throughout the year; however, summer rainfall usually falls as heavy but infrequent downpours associated with thunderstorms; winter rain is usually very light, but can last for days at a time.

In December 2018 amidst drought, the Barwon River at Walgett ceased flowing, reduced to a series of stagnant pools. Bore water from the Great Artesian Basin being used by the town was of questionable quality in relation to the Australian drinking water guidelines, leading to concerns of usage within the town.

==Crime==
The town, like many other remote communities, has problems with crime linked to the abuse of alcohol and other drugs. As a result, many businesses have metal shutters to protect their premises from street crime.

The suspected murder of 31-year-old mother-of-two Roxlyn Margaret Bowie occurred in June 1982 when she vanished from her Walgett family home. A 2014 coronial inquest did not determine the cause of death, and her body has not been located. A one million dollar reward was offered in December 2018 for information leading to the identity of her killer. Her husband was arrested in late 2019 and charged with her murder.

On the night of 9 December 1994, nurse Sandra Hoare was abducted from the Peg Cross Ward of the Walgett District Hospital by Vester and Brendan Fernando, and forced to walk to a nearby sporting field where she was raped by both men. She was then forced to walk further to the perimeter of the nearby Walgett aerodrome where she was murdered by Vester Fernando using a machete to sever her neck in a near-decapitation. Both men were arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Brendan was later stabbed and killed by Vester in Lithgow Correctional Centre in an apparent revenge attack for giving evidence against him prior to and during their trials. Vester Fernando&#x27;s life sentence was compounded by his conviction for murdering his accomplice.

==Economy==
It is a regional hub for wool, wheat and cotton industries. It is the gateway to the New South Wales opal fields at Lightning Ridge to the north and The Grawin to the west. The main crop farmed in the district is wheat; however, the drought has caused an increase in the farming of lucerne and other good hay crops.

==Sport==

Walgett has a strong rugby league culture, and former St. George Dragons player Ricky Walford, whom the town&#x27;s Rugby league ground is named after, played for Walgett Juniors. Walgett is the home of the Walgett Dragons and Newtown Wanderers rugby league clubs, both of which compete in the Barwon Darling Rugby League. The Dragons made eight consecutive grand finals from 2012 to 2019, winning the 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2019 premierships. The Wanderers have not enjoyed the same level of success as of yet, but are a competitive side within the competition.

The Walgett Rams is the local rugby union side in the Western Plains Rugby Union competition. 

The predominant summer sport of the town is cricket. The local competition consists of teams from Walgett, Cumborah, Lightning Ridge, Collarenebri and Goodooga.

The Walgett and District Sporting Club provides facilities for tennis, golf and lawn bowls. The original Tennis Club was situated on the south side of the town in the mid- to late 1960s and 1970s prior to merging with the Bowling Club to become the Walgett District Sporting Club. Likewise, the original Golf Club that was situated on river country some eight kilometres to the west of the town, also merged with the Sporting Club on the north edge of the town allowing the golf course to be re-established along the Namoi River adjacent to the club house proper. The greens are sand and oil as opposed to conventional grass.

The local college hosts two major football carnivals each year. The Ricky Walford Shield and the Neville Thorne Shield are knockout rugby league competitions held in August by the primary school and the high school respectively.

The Walgett Aero Club was established in the town in 1958 with a club house and hangar built at the aerodrome with support from the Walgett Shire Council. The club&#x27;s first two aircraft purchased in its first years were DH-82 Tiger Moths – registrations VH-BAR and VH-WON carrying the name of the nearby Barwon River. As the club progressed and thrived with the appointment of a chief flying instructor in the early 1960s, it eventually modernised its fleet to include the likes of Cessna 172, Cessna 150 and Piper Comanche 210 aircraft. In 2008 the club celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, and continues to be a prosperous part of the transport and aviation hub of the far north of the state.

==Education==

The pre-school, primary school and high school were re-structured in 2003 into the Walgett Community College. The college is a unique educational institution, and gave birth to the successful Yaama Maliyaa group that won several national awards in Young Achievers Australia in 2005.

==Media==

Walgett publishes a weekly newspaper called the &quot;Walgett Spectator&quot; that has been in continuous production since the 1800s, despite a fire razing the business premises in 1903.

Outback Radio 2WEB broadcasts around the area on 104.3FM.

==References in popular culture==

The fictional character Betty in the sitcom &quot;Hey Dad..!&quot; was from Walgett.

Banjo Paterson wrote two poems featuring Walgett – &quot;A Walgett Episode&quot; and &quot;Been There Before&quot;. In &quot;Been There Before&quot; Paterson relates the story of a visitor to the town who is down on his luck and who makes a wager that he can throw a stone from one bank of the river to another. The locals who know that stones of a reasonable mass are a rarity along the banks think they have fooled the visitor. However while...

::&quot;The yokels laughed at his hopes o&#x27;erthrown,&quot;
::&quot;And he stood awhile like a man in a dream;&quot;
::&quot;Then out of his pocket he fetched a stone,&quot;
::&quot;And pelted it over the silent stream—&quot;
::&quot;He had been there before: he had wandered down&quot;
::&quot;On a previous visit to Walgett town.&quot;

Paterson could not decide on which river the town lies. In the former poem he correctly says &quot;Walgett, on the Barwon side&quot;, whereas in the latter he says &quot;The Darling River, at Walgett town&quot;. The Darling River is formed at Brewarrina, much further west than Walgett, from the confluence of the Barwon and Culgoa Rivers.

The Barwon-Darling River system is described as the Barwon River from Mungindi to where it joins the Culgoa River near Brewarrina then becomes the Darling River flowing to the Menindee Lakes.

Walgett lies on the Namoi River, which skirts the east and north-east of the town from where it eventually joins with the Barwon River some five kilometres north-west of the town. The Namoi River rises on the west slopes of the Moonbi Range and Great Dividing Range near Niangala at the convergence of the Macdonald River and Boundary Creek, and flows generally west, joined by 27 tributaries, including the Peel, Manilla and Mooki rivers, before reaching that confluence with the Barwon River.

<text>Leonard Edward Read (September 26, 1898 – May 14, 1983) was the founder of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE), one of the first free market think tanks in the United States. He wrote 29 books and numerous essays, including &quot;I, Pencil&quot; (1958).

==Business career==

After a stint in the United States Army Air Service during World War I, Read started a grocery wholesale business in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which was initially successful but eventually went out of business. He moved to California where he started a new career in the tiny Burlingame Chamber of Commerce near San Francisco. Read gradually moved up the hierarchy of the United States Chamber of Commerce, finally becoming general manager of the Los Angeles branch, the U.S.&#x27;s largest, in 1939.

==Libertarian activism==

During this period his views became progressively more libertarian. Apparently, it was in 1933, during a meeting with William C. Mullendore, the executive vice president of Southern California Edison, that Read was finally convinced that the New Deal was completely inefficient and morally bankrupt. Read was also profoundly influenced by his religious beliefs. His pastor, Reverend James W. Fifield Jr., was minister of the 4,000-member First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, of which Read was also a board member. Fifield ran a &quot;resistance movement&quot; against the &quot;social gospel&quot; of the New Deal, trying to convince ministers across the country to adopt libertarian &quot;spiritual ideals&quot;. During the period when he worked for the Chamber of Commerce, Read was also deeply influenced by more secular figures, such as Albert Jay Nock, and later by Ayn Rand and the economists Ludwig von Mises and Henry Hazlitt.

In 1945, Virgil Jordan, the President of the National Industrial Conference Board (NICB) in New York, invited Read to become its executive vice president. Read realized he would have to leave the NICB to pursue full-time the promotion of free market, limited government principles. He resigned as a result.

One donor from his short time at NICB, David M. Goodrich, encouraged Read to start his own organization. With Goodrich&#x27;s aid, as well as financial aid from the William Volker Fund and from Harold Luhnow, Read and Hazlitt founded the Foundation for Economic Education in 1946, which, in turn, helped to inspire Friedrich Hayek to form the Mont Pelerin Society the following year. For a period in the 1940s, Rand was an important adviser, or &quot;ghost&quot;, as they called it, to Read.

In 1950, Read joined the board of directors for the newly founded periodical &quot;The Freeman&quot;, a free market magazine that was a forerunner of the conservative &quot;National Review&quot;, to which Read was also a contributor. In 1954, Read arranged for the struggling magazine to be transferred to a for-profit company owned by FEE. In 1956, FEE assumed direct control of the magazine, turning it into a non-profit outreach tool for the foundation.

Read received an Honorary Doctoral Degree at Universidad Francisco Marroquín in 1976. He continued to work with FEE until his death in 1983.

<text>The Bombardier Challenger 600 series is a family of business jets developed by Canadair after a Bill Lear concept, and then produced from 1986 by its new owner, Bombardier Aerospace.

At the end of 1975, Canadair began funding the development of LearStar 600, and then bought the design for a wide-cabin business jet in April 1976.
On 29 October, the programme was launched, backed by the Canadian federal government, and designed to comply with new FAR part 25 standards.

In March 1977, it was renamed the Challenger 600 after Bill Lear was phased out, and the original conventional tail was changed for a T-tail among other developments.
The first prototype was rolled out on 25 May 1978, and performed its maiden flight on 8 November.
The flight test program saw a deadly crash on 3 April 1980, but Transport Canada approved the CL-600 type certification on 10 August 1980.

In 1986, Canadair was close to bankruptcy and was bought by Bombardier.
The jet was later stretched into the Bombardier CRJ regional airliner, introduced on 19 October 1992, and the longer range Global Express, introduced in July 1999.
The 500th Challenger was rolled out in May 2000, and the 1000th was delivered to NetJets in December 2015.
By October 2018, 1,066 aircraft had been built.
The Challenger is a low-wing jet powered by two turbofans mounted in aft fuselage pods, with a supercritical wing and a stand-up cabin with two seating sections.

The original Lycoming ALF 502 turbofans were replaced by a pair of General Electric CF34s on the CL-601, which also gained winglets, and first flew on 10 April 1982.
Subsequent variants have updated systems, avionics, and higher weights.

==Development==
===Origins===

Around 1974, American aviation inventor Bill Lear conceptualised the LearStar 600, a low-wing, long-distance business jet, which was powered by a pair of Garrett TFE731-1 geared turbofan engines and equipped with a supercritical wing. Lear lacked the capabilities to launch such an aircraft, thus sought out other agencies to collaborate with to both produce and sell it, including the Canadian aerospace manufacturer Canadair. According to authors Ron Picklet and Larry Milberry, Canadair&#x27;s top management were of the opinion that Lear&#x27;s concept was sketchy at best. Lear did not have an expert grasp of aeronautical engineering; so far, he had only been able to pay an American aeronautical consultant to undertake very preliminary design explorations.

Following a study, contrasting the proposed Learstar against rivals such as the Lockheed Jetstar, Dassault Falcon 50, and Grumman Gulfstream II, Canadair decided to give its backing to the idea near the end of 1975. According to aerospace industry publication &quot;Flight International&quot;, the programme was viewed by many Canadians as a step towards developing a privately driven high-technology aviation industry that would compete at a global level. Perhaps more importantly, the Canadian government had issued a demand that Canadair become self-sufficient, thus the company wanted to depend less upon subcontracting arrangements with other firms, such as France&#x27;s Dassault Aviation and America&#x27;s Boeing, or providing support packages for existing aircraft for which they had already ended production, such as the CF-5 fighter. Canadair felt a need to prove its ability to independently develop original high-tech projects at this time.

Canadair planned to use Lear&#x27;s name and skills at self-promotion to secure extensive financial guarantees for a business-jet project from the Canadian federal government. This proved an effective choice: Future Prime Minister Jean Chrétien specifically refers to the effect of personal contact with Lear on his decision to direct financial support to Canadair&#x27;s program. At the time of these events, Chrétien was successively president of the Treasury Board, minister of Industry, Trade, and Commerce, and minister of Finance, in the Canadian government. Due to the use of letters of comfort, the extent of the ministry&#x27;s financial commitments for Canadair could be kept from parliament and the public for several years. These financial guarantees were later used as an academic example of insufficient monitoring and lax controls in government support of industry.

In April 1976, Canadair acquired the LearStar 600 concept. By then it was long, and wide, and capable of a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of . As an executive jet, it had sufficient capacity for 14 passengers. In a freighter configuration, it had a 3,400 kg (7,500 lb) payload capacity, loaded and unloaded through a forward door. As a commuter airliner, it could seat up to 30 passengers in a 2–1 seating configuration. Canadair developed the design into a large airframe, furnished with a new supercritical wing design, new avionics and engines, as well as for compliance with new FAR part 25 standards. The configuration was frozen in August and a 1/25 model was tested in the National Aeronautical Establishment transonic wind tunnel. Reportedly, in excess of 1,800 hours of wind tunnel testing were performed upon the supercritical wing alone.

===Launch===
Backed by the federal government, the programme was launched on 29 October 1976 with firm orders and deposits for 53 aircraft. Within the next two years, roughly 2,500 employees were involved in designing the aircraft. Changes to the original Learstar configuration had been made on the run up to the launch, such as the conventional tailplane being substituted for a T-tail counterpart after the former was found to be in the path of the engine&#x27;s exhaust flow, the relocation of fuel storage to the wings, and multiple increases of the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight. Following disagreements over the direction of the programme, Bill Lear was phased out of involvement. In March 1977, the aircraft was renamed the Challenger 600. Reportedly, following his disassociation with the venture, Lear referred to Canadair&#x27;s revised design as &quot;Fat Albert&quot;. Following Lear&#x27;s death in May 1978, Canadair paid an estimated $25 million to his estate for his contribution to the programme.

Due to the expansion of the design, the original powerplant configuration became untenable. Engine manufacturer Lycoming proposed developing a new model, the Lycoming ALF 502L, which Canadair&#x27;s design team accepted for the enlarged Challenger, and around which drew up its general arrangement. The type&#x27;s wide cargo door had been designed in response to the needs of FedEx, the type&#x27;s original launch customer, having placed an order for 25 aircraft. FedEx had experienced problems with the General Electric CF34 engines, and favoured the Lycoming ALF 502D, instead. Those later had delivery troubles and lacked performance. Reportedly, FedEx converted most of its orders into the Challenger&#x27;s stretched version, intending to carry up to 12,500 lb of freight at a time using them. FedEx ultimately opted to cancel its orders due to the US Airline Deregulation Act, and the specific aircraft that were already in production were sold to other customers instead.

By the spring of 1977, Canadair had received over 70 firm orders and had begun constructing three prototypes. A $70 million loan was borrowed from European sources to help finance the programme, which lessened the financial burden on the Canadian government. A full-scale fuselage mockup was displayed at the 1977 Paris Air Show before a European and North American tour. 106 were sold by the end of 1977. In late 1977, in the face of criticism that the project would not be capable of producing an aircraft fulfilling the performance guarantees made, Canadair officials had commented that they expected the first flight to occur in 1978, and that initial deliveries had been scheduled to begin during September 1979. &quot;Flight International&quot; noted that even prior to the prototype&#x27;s first flight, the type had already made a noticeable impact upon the competition, including the launch of the Cessna Citation III and Grumman Gulfstream III.

By early March 1978, the first prototype was almost finished and the assembly of the two other had debuted. Destined to control handling qualities and test flight performance, it was formally rolled out on 25 May 1978. 116 orders were confirmed 19 months after go-ahead. By this point, production jigs allowing for a production rate of up to seven Challengers per month had been established, ready for quantity production to proceed. Airframe structural testing began in February 1979. Operational test cycling started in December 1979, simulating 72,638 flight hours by February 1985, while its predicted lifetime was 30,000 hours.

===Flight test phase===

On 8 November 1978, the prototype aircraft took off for its maiden flight from Montreal, Quebec. The flight test and certification program were conducted at Mojave Kern County Airport instead of Canada due to better weather. The second and third prototypes first flew during 1979. A test flight on 3 April 1980 in the Mojave Desert resulted in disaster. The aircraft crashed due to the failure of the release mechanism to detach the recovery chute after a deep stall, killing one of the test pilots. The other test pilot and the flight test engineer parachuted to safety.

The CL-600-1A11 type certification was approved by Transport Canada in August 1980, and by the US Federal Aviation Administration in November 1980.

The program cost was C$1.5 billion (US$ billion at the time).

===Further development===
In 1980, the first production model of the Challenger series, the CL-600, entered service with end customers. Early marketing of the type by Canadair typically contrasted the more spacious cabin offered by the Challenger against its competitors, which typically had more narrow fuselages, and therefore cramped conditions, as well as the type&#x27;s fuel economy. By 1982, while only 10 aircraft had entered service, the company had begun publicising a new model of the aircraft, the CL-601, which was to be powered by a pair of General Electric CF34 turbofan engines in place of the original models’ Lycoming units. On 10 April 1982, the CL-601 performed its maiden flight. According to &quot;Flight International&quot;, the decision to adopt the CF34 engine for the new model was responsible for generating a substantial boom in Challenger sales.

According to &quot;Flight International&quot;, the slow initial sales of the Challenger heavily contributed to the near-bankruptcy of Canadair, which was only avoided by the purchase of the company by Bombardier in 1986. Bombardier elected not only to continue production of the type, but also to finance the development of new models and derivatives. This choice was aided by Canadair&#x27;s design decision to enable the Challenger to be readily stretched from the onset. As of October 2018, the best-selling variant of the Challenger series has been the CL-604, which was launched in 1995. The 500th aircraft was rolled out in May 2000. The 1000th, a 650, was delivered to NetJets in December 2015.

According to &quot;Flight International&quot;, the Challenger 600 has been a foothold in the market for Bombardier, allowing them to more easily develop further business jets, such as the Bombardier Global Express. Another direct derivative of the Challenger series has been the Bombardier CRJ100 series, a larger regional airliner. The publication commented that the Challenger family &quot;appears to have a solid future&quot;, observing a production rate of two aircraft per month throughout 2018.

==Design==

The Challenger is a twin-engined business jet, described by &quot;Flight International&quot; as being a &quot;miniaturised twinjet airliner in every respect&quot;. While the Challenger is generally similar in configuration to previous aircraft of its type, some of its features stand out; for example, a widened fuselage allows a &quot;walk-about cabin&quot;. The Challenger was also one of the first business jets to be designed with a supercritical wing. The wing was referred to by Canadair as being one of the aircraft&#x27;s most advanced features. It is also capable of performing short takeoffs while maintaining the speed and comfort levels normally associated with larger jetliners.

The Challenger&#x27;s wing has been referred to as being a modified NACA symmetrical aerofoil. Akin to other supercritical wings, it features a rounded leading edge, an inverted camber, a blunt trailing edge and scalloping of the underside. The twin-spar wing box structure spans the entire length of the wing and is compartmentalised to form five internal fuel tanks; these tanks can accommodate up to 14,661 lb of fuel, nearly half the aircraft&#x27;s empty weight.

The skins of the wings are produced using large milling machines, which in 1978 were claimed to be superior to anything else in North America. Many elements, such as the flaps, ailerons, and leading edge, feature conventional construction. Several parts, including the wing/fuselage fairing, flap shrouds, and wingtips, are moulded out of Kevlar, as are other elements of the aircraft.

The original CL-600 Challenger was powered by two Lycoming ALF 502L turbofan engines, which were developed specifically for the Challenger. Subsequent models adopted other powerplants, including the General Electric CF34 engine. The engines are mounted on the rear fuselage close to the aircraft&#x27;s tail, providing smooth airflow to the engines even when flown at high angles of attack, although this was in a lower position than the original LearStar concept had placed them to mitigate unfavourable pitch control characteristics. The engines are fitted with thrust reversers to decrease landing distances. An auxiliary power unit is also present for starting the engines and providing air conditioning within the cabin while on the ground.

The fuselage comprises three sections — the nose, centre, and tail — which are manufactured separately in their own jigs and joined later on in the production process. It has been designed to be pressurised at a maximum differential of 9.3 lb/sq in. Various cutouts are present across the fuselage to accommodate features such as a large main door on the port side of the aircraft forward of the wing, multiple regulation-compliant emergency exits, a baggage hatch on the port-side aft of the wing, and numerous windows.

The fuselage diameter was designed to accommodate an unobstructed cabin floor, a cabin height of 6 ft 1 in in the centre section, and space for the wing box, underfloor integral fuel tanks, air ducts, and various control cabling. It was also designed to easily accommodate Canadair&#x27;s early plans to stretch the fuselage, for which equal-length plugs are installed fore and aft of the centre section to greatly increase the Challenger&#x27;s capacity.

Various avionics are present in the Challenger. As standard, the CL-600 is furnished with a dual-channel Sperry SPZ-600 automatic flight control system, incorporating a flight director and air data computers; more typical to larger commercial aircraft, this system is certifiable for conducting Category 3A automatic landings. The flight control system features significant redundancy, including three individual hydraulic systems; even with complete failure and the loss of one actuator, a viable level of assisted control over the key flight surfaces remains present. Weather radar and Marconi-built solid-state instrument displays are supplied as standard, as well as a Collins-built radio set; optional long-range, radio-based equipment, such as a HF radio set and VHF navigational aids can be installed.

In a standard executive aircraft configuration, the cabin is divided between the forward galley, and two seating sections, which are typically fitted with a four-chair club section followed by either a conference grouping area or divans, along with a lavatory at the aft end. The chairs are fully reclining and can swivel, while the divans can serve as sleeping accommodation. Early examples feature luxuries such as telephones, lighting controls, and stereo systems; foldaway tables attached to the cabin walls were also installed, along with a pair of wardrobes, one fore and one aft, for storing hand luggage and other small items.

<text>Chester William David Brown (born 16 May 1960) is a Canadian cartoonist. Brown has gone through several stylistic and thematic periods. He gained notice in alternative comics circles in the 1980s for the surreal, scatological &quot;Ed the Happy Clown&quot; serial. After bringing &quot;Ed&quot; to an abrupt end, he delved into confessional autobiographical comics in the early 1990s and was strongly associated with fellow Toronto-based cartoonists Joe Matt and Seth, and the autobiographical comics trend. Two graphic novels came from this period: &quot;The Playboy&quot; (1992) and &quot;I Never Liked You&quot; (1994). Surprise mainstream success in the 2000s came with &quot;Louis Riel&quot; (2003), a historical-biographical graphic novel about rebel Métis leader Louis Riel. &quot;Paying for It&quot; (2011) drew controversy as a polemic in support of decriminalizing prostitution, a theme he explored further with &quot;Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus&quot; (2016), a book of adaptations of stories from the Bible that Brown believes promote pro-prostitution attitudes among early Christians.

Brown draws from a range of influences, including monster and superhero comic books, underground comix, and comic strips such as Harold Gray&#x27;s &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;. His later works employ a sparse drawing style and flat dialogue. Rather than the traditional method of drawing complete pages, Brown draws individual panels without regard for page composition and assembles them into pages after completion. Since the late 1990s Brown has had a penchant for providing detailed annotations for his work and extensively altering and reformatting older works.

Brown at first self-published his work as a minicomic called &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; beginning in 1983; Toronto publisher Vortex Comics began publishing the series as a comic book in 1986. The content tended towards controversial themes: a distributor and a printer dropped it in the late 1980s, and it has been held up at the Canada–United States border. Since 1991, Brown has associated himself with Montreal publisher Drawn &amp; Quarterly. Following &quot;Louis Riel&quot; Brown ceased serializing his work to publish graphic novels directly. He has received grants from the Canada Council to complete &quot;Louis Riel&quot; and &quot;Paying for It&quot;.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Chester William David Brown was born on 16 May 1960 at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He grew up in Châteauguay, a Montreal suburb with a large English-speaking minority. His grandfather was history professor Chester New, after whom Chester New Hall is named at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. He has a brother, Gordon, who is two years his junior. His mother had schizophrenia, and died in 1976 after falling down the stairs while in the Montreal General Hospital.

Though he grew up in a predominantly French-speaking province and had his first mainstream success with his biography of French-speaking Métis rebel leader Louis Riel, Brown says he does not speak French. He said he had little contact with francophone culture when he was growing up, and the French speakers he had contact with spoke with him in English.

Brown described himself as a &quot;nerdy teenager&quot; attracted to comic books from a young age, especially ones about superheroes and monsters. He aimed at a career in superhero comics, and after graduating from high school in 1977 headed to New York City, where he had unsuccessful but encouraging interviews with Marvel and DC Comics. He moved to Montreal where he attended Dawson College. The program did not aim at a comics career, and he dropped out after a little more than a year. He tried to find work in New York, but was rejected again. He discovered the alternative comics scene that was developing in the early 1980s, and grasped its feeling freedom to produce what he wanted. At 19 he moved to Toronto, where he got a job in a photography lab and lived frugally in rooming houses.

===Toronto (1979–1986)===
At around twenty, Brown&#x27;s interests moved away from superhero and monster comic books towards the work of Robert Crumb and other underground cartoonists, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine, and Will Eisner&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;A Contract with God&quot; (1978). He started drawing in an underground-inspired style, and submitted his work to publishers Fantagraphics Books and Last Gasp; he got an encouraging rejection when he submitted to Art Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; magazine. He became friends with film archivist Reg Hartt, and the two unsuccessfully planned to put out a comics anthology called &quot;Beans and Wieners&quot; as a showcase for local Toronto talent.

In 1983 Brown&#x27;s girlfriend Kris Nakamura introduced him to the small-press publisher John W. Curry (or &quot;jwcurry&quot;), whose example inspired the local small-press community. Nakamura convinced Brown that summer to print his unpublished work as minicomics, which he did under his Tortured Canoe imprint. The sporadically self-published &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; lasted seven issues as a minicomic. Brown soon found himself at the centre of Toronto&#x27;s small-press scene. While he found it difficult at first, Brown managed to get the title into independent bookstores, the emerging comic shops, and other countercultural retailers, and also sold it through the growing North American zine network. &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; had respectable sales through several reprintings and repackaging.

Brown and a number of other cartoonists featured in a show called Kromalaffing at the Grunwald Art Gallery in early 1984. He had become a part of Toronto&#x27;s avant-garde community, along with other artists, musicians and writers, centred around Queen Street West. In 1986, at the urging of Brown&#x27;s future friend Seth, Vortex Comics publisher Bill Marks picked up &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; as a regular, initially bimonthly comic book. Brown quit his day job to work full-time on &quot;Yummy Fur&quot;.

===Vortex and &quot;Ed the Happy Clown&quot; (1986–1989)===

Starting publication in December 1986, the first three issues of &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; reprinted the contents of the seven issues of the earlier minicomic, and Brown quit his job at the copy shop. Brown began to weave together some of the earlier unrelated strips into an ongoing surreal black comedy called &quot;Ed the Happy Clown&quot;. The bizarre misfortunes of the title character include being inundated in the faeces of a man unable to stop defaecating, being chased by cannibalistic pygmies, befriending a vengeful vampire, and having the head of his penis replaced by the head of a miniature Ronald Reagan from another dimension.

A counterpoint to the at-times blasphemous &quot;Ed&quot; serial, Brown also began to run straight adaptation of the Gospels, beginning with the Gospel of Mark in a subdued style. What appeared a natural target of satire for the author of &quot;Ed&quot; was instead a continuing attempt of Brown&#x27;s to find what he really believed, having been raised a Christian Baptist. The adaptations later continued with the Gospel of Matthew and the apocryphal &quot;The Twin&quot; from the Gnostic text &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, and Brown went through periods of agnosticism and Gnosticism.

The offensive content of &quot;Ed&quot; caused it to be dropped by one printer, and is suspected to be behind Diamond Comic Distributors&#x27; decision to stop distributing &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; starting with issue #9. After &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; announced they would be investigating the issue, Diamond started distributing it again.

In 1989 the first &quot;Ed&quot; collection appeared, collecting the &quot;Ed&quot; stories from the first twelve issues of &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; with an introduction by &quot;American Splendor&quot; writer Harvey Pekar and drawn by Brown. At this point, Brown had grown to lose interest in the &quot;Ed&quot; story as he gravitated toward the autobiographical approach of Pekar, Joe Matt, and Julie Doucet, and the simpler artwork of Seth. He brought &quot;Ed&quot; to an abrupt end in &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; #18 to turn to autobiography.

===Autobio and &quot;Drawn &amp; Quarterly&quot; (1990–1992)===

The 19th issue of &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; began his autobiographical period. First came the strip &quot;Helder&quot;, about a violent tenant in Brown&#x27;s boarding house, followed by &quot;Showing &#x27;Helder&#x27;&quot;, about the creation of &quot;Helder&quot; and the reactions of Brown&#x27;s friends to the work-in-progress. With &quot;Showing &#x27;Helder&#x27;&quot; Brown breaks from his earlier syle by giving the panels no borders and arranging them organically on the page—a style that was to characterize his work of this period. He found his friends were uncomfortable with his writing about their lives, and soon turned to his adolescence for source material.

Brown began the first installment of what was to become the graphic novel &quot;The Playboy&quot; in &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; #21, under the title &quot;Disgust&quot;. The revealing, confessional story tells of the teenage Brown&#x27;s feelings of guilt over his obsessive masturbating over the Playmates of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, and the difficulties he had relating to women even into adulthood. Critical and fan reception was strong, though it drew some criticism from those who saw it glorifying pornography. &quot;Playboy&quot;″s publisher Hugh Hefner wrote Brown a letter of concern that Brown could feel such guilt in a post-sexual revolution world. It appeared in a collected edition titled &quot;The Playboy&quot; in 1992.

Around this time, Brown had become friends with the cartoonists Seth and Joe Matt. The three became noted for doing confessional autobio comics in the early 1990s, and for depicting each other in their works. In 1993, they did an interview together in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;″s autobiographical comics issue. Seth had joined the new Montreal-based comics publisher Drawn &amp; Quarterly, which had also started publishing Julie Doucet. D&amp;Q&#x27;s Chris Oliveros had been courting Brown to join as well, but Brown had felt loyal to Bill Marks for giving him his first break. When his contract came up in 1991, however, Oliveros offered Brown nearly double the royalty he was getting from Vortex. Brown moved to D&amp;Q starting with &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; #25.

===Vancouver and &quot;Underwater&quot; (1992–1997)===
In 1992, Brown began a relationship with musician Sook-Yin Lee, and in 1993 moved to Vancouver to be with her. He stayed there with her until 1995, when Lee began as VJ at MuchMusic in Toronto, and the two moved back there together.

Brown moved away from autobio after the conclusion of &quot;Fuck&quot;, and for his next major project, Chris Oliveros convinced him to change the title, believing the title &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; was no longer a fitting one for the direction that Brown&#x27;s work had taken, and that the title made the book harder to sell. His next work, &quot;Underwater&quot;, would appear under its own title, while continuing the Gospel of Matthew adaptation as a backup feature.

&quot;Underwater&quot; was an ambitious work. Its lead character, Kupifam, was an infant who was surrounded by an encoded gibberish-like language, which she comes to understand in bits and pieces. Fans and critics gave the series a lukewarm reception, with its glacial pacing and obscure narrative. Eventually, Brown came to feel he had gotten in over his head with the scope of the project. In early 1998, he decided to leave it in an unfinished state.

Partway through the series, in 1996, Brown and Lee broke up. They continued to live with each other, and have continued to be close friends. Brown came to decide that he no longer wanted to have exclusive relations with women, but also realized he lacked the social skills to pick up girls for casual sex. He spent the next few years celibate.

===Louis Riel and frequenting of prostitutes (1998–2003)===

Brown&#x27;s father died in 1998 as he was putting together his collection of short strips, &quot;The Little Man&quot;. He lost interest in &quot;Underwater&quot;, and had been reading about Métis resistance leader Louis Riel, and decided he wanted to do a biography on him. He wanted to do it as an original graphic novel, but Chris Oliveros convinced him to serialize it first. Drawn &amp; Quarterly put out the ten issues of &quot;Louis Riel&quot; from 1999 until 2003, and with help from a CAD$16,000 grant from the Canadian Council for the Arts, the finished annotated collection appeared in 2003, to much acclaim and healthy sales. In Canada it became a bestseller, a first for a Canadian graphic novel.

In 1999, after three years of celibacy, Brown decided he would start frequenting prostitutes. His open nature prevented him from hiding this fact from his friends, and the fact soon became widely known. After completing &quot;Louis Riel&quot;, he embarked upon another autobiographical graphic novel that would detail his experiences as a john. This time, the work would not be serialized, and would wait until 2011 to be published as &quot;Paying for It&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Brown moved out from the place he shared with Lee and got himself a condominium, where he lived by himself, and was free to bring prostitutes home. Around this time, Joe Matt moved back to the US, and Seth moved to Guelph, Ontario, breaking up the &quot;Toronto Three&quot;.

===Libertarianism and &quot;Paying for It&quot; (2004–present)===

While reading up on issues surrounding Louis Riel, Brown became increasingly interested in property rights. His reading eventually took him to believe that countries with strong property rights prospered, while those without them did not. This path gradually led him to espouse the ideology of libertarianism. He joined the Libertarian Party of Canada and ran as the party&#x27;s candidate in the riding of Trinity—Spadina in Toronto in the 2008 and 2011 federal elections.

During the long wait between &quot;Louis Riel&quot; and &quot;Paying for It&quot;, Brown allowed Drawn &amp; Quarterly to reprint &quot;Ed the Happy Clown&quot; as a serial comic book, with explanatory notes that were becoming both more common and more detailed in Brown&#x27;s work. In 2007 Brown provided six weeks worth of strips to Toronto&#x27;s &quot;NOW&quot; magazine as part of the &quot;Live With Culture&quot; ad campaign. The strip features a male zombie and a living human girl participating in various cultural activities, culminating in the two going to a movie theatre to watch Bruce McDonald&#x27;s yet-unmade &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; adaptation.

Brown&#x27;s next graphic novel, &quot;Paying for It&quot;, came out during the 2011 election, in which he was running. Again he finished with the help of a Canada Council grant. It was a polemic promoting the decriminalization of prostitution, and attracted praise for its artistry and bare-all honesty, and criticism for its subject matter and Brown&#x27;s perceived naïveté as he brushes aside concerns about human trafficking and dismisses drug addiction as a myth. At about this time, Brown finally stated he didn&#x27;t intend to finish his Gospel of Matthew, which had been on hiatus since 1997.

In 2016 Brown followed up &quot;Paying for It&quot; with &quot;Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus&quot;, made up of adaptations of stories from the Bible that Brown believes promote pro-prostitution attitudes among early Christians, and argues for the decriminalization of prostitution. Brown declared his research determined that Mary, mother of Jesus, was a prostitute, that early Christians practised prostitution, and that Jesus&#x27; Parable of the Talents should be read in a pro-prostitution light. Brown describes himself as a Christian who is &quot;not at all concerned with imposing &#x27;moral&#x27; values or religious laws on others&quot; and believes that Biblical figures such as Abel and Job &quot;find favour with God because they oppose his will or challenge him in some way&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Religion===

Brown was brought up in a Baptist household, and in his early twenties he began adapting the Gospels. Brown later said that this &quot;was a matter of trying to figure out whether even believed the Christian claims—whether or not Jesus was divine&quot;. During this time, Brown went through periods where he considered himself an agnostic then a gnostic. Since then, Brown has consistently described himself as religious, but has alternated between periods of identifying as a Christian and simply believing in God. As of 2016, Brown describes himself as a Christian.

===Politics===

In the 1980s Brown expressed sympathy for left-wing politics, although he has stated his understanding of politics was not deep. He considered himself an anarchist until, while researching &quot;Louis Riel&quot;, he became interested in issues of property rights, especially influenced by his reading of Tom Bethell&#x27;s &quot;The Noblest Triumph&quot;, a book which argues that the West owes its prosperity to having established strong property rights. Brown thus gained an interest in libertarianism—a belief that government should protect property rights (although, he says, not copyrights), and otherwise should mostly keep out of people&#x27;s lives. After attending a few meetings of the Libertarian Party of Canada, he was asked to run for Parliament, and collected the 100 signatures necessary to appear on the ballot.

Brown ran as the Libertarian Party&#x27;s candidate for the riding (or constituency) of Trinity—Spadina in the 2008 federal election. He came in fifth out of seven candidates. He stood in the same riding for the same party in the 2011 Canadian federal election, coming in fifth out of six candidates. The 2011 election coincided with the release of &quot;Paying for It&quot;, in which Brown talks about his frequenting prostitutes. He was worried his promotion of that topic in the media would make the Libertarian Party uncomfortable with having him run, but his official Party agent and the Ontario representative assured him that, as libertarians, they believed in individual freedom, and would continue to support his candidacy.

===Personal relations===

A longtime friend of fellow cartoonists Joe Matt and Seth, Brown has been regularly featured in their autobiographical comics over the years, and collaborated with them on various projects. The three were often mentioned together, and have been called &quot;the Three Musketeers of alternative comics&quot; and the &quot;Toronto Three&quot;, forming &quot;a kind of gutter rat pack trying to make it through their drawing boards in 1990s Toronto&quot;. Brown dedicated &quot;The Playboy&quot; to Seth, and &quot;Paying for It&quot; to Matt. Seth dedicated his graphic novel &quot;George Sprott&quot; to Brown (&quot;Best Cartoonist, Best Friend&quot;).

Brown had a long-term relationship with the musician, actress and media personality Sook-Yin Lee from 1992 until 1996. She is depicted in several of his comics. He moved to Vancouver for two years to be with her, and moved back to Toronto with her when she became a VJ for MuchMusic. He also drew the cover for her 1996 solo album &quot;Wigs &#x27;n Guns&quot;. Brown&#x27;s relationship with Lee is the last boyfriend/girlfriend relationship he had, as he explains in &quot;Paying for It&quot;. They remain good friends, and Brown has contributed artwork to her productions as recently as 2009&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Carnivore&quot;.

==Work==

===Thematic subjects===

Throughout his early years as a cartoonist he mostly experimented with drawing on the darker side of his subconscious, basing his comedy on free-form association, much like the surrealist technique Automatism. An example of such methods in Brown&#x27;s work can be found in short one-pagers where he randomly selects comic panels from other sources and then mixes them up, often altering the dialogue. This produced an experimental, absurdist effect in his early strips.

Brown first discusses mental illness in his strip &quot;My Mother Was A Schizophrenic&quot;. In it, he puts forward the anti-psychiatric idea that what we call &quot;schizophrenia&quot; isn&#x27;t a real disease at all, but instead a tool our society uses to deal with people who display socially unacceptable beliefs and behaviour. Inspired by the evangelical tracts of Jack T. Chick, Brown left Xeroxes of these strips at bus stops and phone booths around Toronto so its message would reach a wider audience. It first appeared in &quot;Underwater&quot; #4, and is also reprinted in the collection &quot;The Little Man&quot;.

Brown&#x27;s Louis Riel book was inspired by the alleged mental instability of Riel, and Brown&#x27;s own anarchist politics, and he began his research for the book in 1998. Over the course of researching for the book, he shifted his politics over the course of several years until he was a libertarian. Regarding anarchy, Brown has said, &quot;I&#x27;m still an anarchist to the degree that I think we should be aiming towards an anarchist society but I don&#x27;t think we can actually get there. We probably do need some degree of government.&quot;

===Art style===

Brown&#x27;s drawing style has evolved and changed a lot throughout his career. He&#x27;s been known to switch between using Rapidograph pens, dip pens, brushes, pencils and markers for his black-and-white cartooning, and has used paints for some colour covers (notably in &quot;Underwater&quot;).

====Working method====

Brown does not follow the tradition of drawing his comics by the page – he draws them one panel at a time, and then arranges them on the page. In the case of his acclaimed graphic novels &quot;The Playboy&quot; and &quot;I Never Liked You&quot;, this allowed him to rearrange the panels on the page as he saw fit. In the case of &quot;I Never Liked You&quot;, this resulted in a different page count in the book collection than was in the &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; serialization. The panels were slightly rearranged again when the &quot;New Definitive Edition&quot; of &quot;I Never Liked You&quot; was released in 2002. Brown depicted himself making comics in this way in the story &quot;Showing Helder&quot; in &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; #20 (also collected in &quot;The Little Man&quot;). Despite drawing his panels individually, he says his &quot;brain doesn&#x27;t tend to think in terms of one image at a time&quot;, so that he has difficulty coming up with one-image covers.

He has used a number of different drawing tools, including Rapidograph technical pens, markers, crowquill pens and ink brushes, the latter of which he has called his favourite tool, for its &quot;fluid grace&quot;. For much of &quot;Ed the Happy Clown&quot;, he had artwork printed from photocopies of his pencils, which was faster for him than inking the work, and produced a more spontaneous feel, but in the end he turned away from this method, feeling it was &quot;too raw&quot;.

====Drawing influences====

In an interview with Seth, Brown says his earliest childhood cartoon was an imitation of Doug Wright&#x27;s &quot;Little Nipper&quot;. He frequently mentions Steve Gerber as amongst his foremost influences of his teenage years. From about the age of 20, Brown discovered the work of Robert Crumb and other underground artists, as well as class comic strip artists such as Harold Gray, whose influence is most evident in Brown&#x27;s &quot;Louis Riel&quot;.

Brown often talks of contemporaries Seth, Joe Matt and Julie Doucet&#x27;s influence on his work, especially during his autobiographical period. He also had been reading the &quot;Little Lulu Library&quot; around this time, and credit&#x27;s the cartooning of &quot;Little Lulu&quot; John Stanley and Seth with his desire to simplify his style during this period.

The stiff, stylized look of Fletcher Hanks&#x27; comics, reprints from Fantagraphics of which Brown had been reading around the time, was the primary influence on the style Brown used in &quot;Paying for It&quot;.

===Series===

===Books===

===Title changes===

Many of his books have undergone title changes, sometimes at the behest of his publisher, sometimes without his permission. &quot;Ed the Happy Clown: the Definitive Ed Book&quot; was given the &quot;Definitive&quot; title, despite the fact that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to put that as the subtitle of the second edition. Vortex did it for marketing reasons.&quot; &quot;The Playboy&quot; was originally titled &quot;Disgust&quot; and then &quot;The Playboy Stories&quot;, and &quot;I Never Liked You&quot; was called &quot;Fuck&quot; (the German translation retains that title). &quot;Underwater&quot; was originally intended to appear in &quot;Yummy Fur&quot;, but Brown&#x27;s new publisher felt they could attract more readers with a different title. &quot;Paying for It&quot; carries the sense of a double entendre that Brown dislikes–he would have preferred to call the book &quot;I Pay for Sex&quot;.

===Illustration===

Brown has also done a certain amount of illustration work. In 1998, he did the cover to Sphinx Productions&#x27; &quot;Comic Book Confidential #1&quot;; in 2005 he did the cover to &quot;True Porn 2&quot; from Alternative Comics; and he illustrated the cover for Penguin Books&#x27; Deluxe Classics edition of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; by D. H. Lawrence. Brown illustrated the cover to the 11 July 2004, issue of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, an issue whose theme was graphic novels. He has done the cover for Sook-Yin Lee&#x27;s 1996 solo album &quot;Wigs &#x27;n&#x27; Guns&quot; (to which he also contributed lyrics for one song), and the poster for her film, &quot;Year of the Carnivore&quot;.

===Collaborations===
Brown provided the illustrations for the story &quot;A Tribute to Bill Marks&quot; in Harvey Pekar&#x27;s &quot;American Splendor&quot; #15 in 1990, and &quot;How This Forward Got Written&quot; in &quot;The New American Splendor Anthology&quot; in 1991.

He inked Seth&#x27;s pencils for the story &quot;Them Changes&quot; in Dennis Eichhorn&#x27;s &quot;Real Stuff&quot; #6 in 1992, and shared artwork duties with Sook-Yin Lee on the story &quot;The Not So Great Escape&quot; in &quot;Real Stuff&quot; #16 in 1993.

He also inked Steve Bissette&#x27;s pencils for the story &quot;It Came From ... Higher Space!&quot; in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;1963&quot; #3 in 1993.

A jam piece with Dave Sim was included in the &quot;Cerebus World Tour Book&quot; in 1995.

==Recognition==

Over the years, Brown has received four Harvey Awards and numerous Harvey and Ignatz award nominations. The autobiographical comics from &quot;Yummy Fur&quot; placed on the &quot;Comics Journal&quot;″s list of the 100 best comics of the century. Brown was inducted into the Canadian Comic Book Creator Hall of Fame, on 18 June 2011, at the Joe Shuster Awards in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Brown was one of the cartoonists to appear in the first volume of Fantagraphics&#x27; two-volume &quot;The Best Comics of the Decade&quot; (1990. ).

<text>The &quot;Darkover&quot; series is a collection of science fiction-fantasy novels and short stories written by Marion Zimmer Bradley. The series is set on the planet of Darkover, where a group of humans have been stranded and have developed their own unique culture and society. The books focus on the conflicts between the human settlers and the native population of Darkover, as well as the struggles of the various factions on the planet. The series is known for its complex world-building and exploration of themes such as gender, sexuality, and mental illness.
Occasionally, Bradley collaborated with other authors, and she also edited and published Darkover stories by other authors in a series of anthologies. After Bradley&#x27;s death, the series was continued, mostly by Deborah J. Ross with the permission of the Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Works Trust.

Commenting on the significance of the &quot;Darkover&quot; series, science fiction author Baird Searles said that the books were &quot;destined to be &quot;The Foundation&quot; of the 1970s&quot;.

In the introduction to &quot;The Ballad of Hastur and Cassilda&quot; by Bradley in the anthology &quot;Red Sun of Darkover&quot;, Bradley writes that the literary antecedents of this ballad are &quot;obscure&quot; and arose &quot;before &quot;Darkover&quot; was &quot;Darkover&quot;&quot;. The antecedents are &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; (1895) by Robert W. Chambers and perhaps J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lay of Beren and Lúthien&quot;, found in the first book of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Bradley adapted many names from &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; into her books and stories, often using them differently, e. g. the name of a city might become the name of a person. Chambers borrowed some terms in &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; from the writings of Ambrose Bierce.

In her essay (perhaps a transcribed interview) called &quot;A Darkover Retrospective&quot;, Bradley mentions reading the works of H. Rider Haggard, Talbot Mundy, Robert W. Chambers, and Sax Rohmer, but that she did not begin writing fantasy until she became acquainted with the science-fiction/fantasy of C. L. Moore and Henry Kuttner, apparently when she was in her middle teens and realized that she would never be an opera singer. She wrote, among other things, &quot;about a ruling caste of telepaths which I named Seveners&quot;. By the time she was in college this had turned into an &quot;hugely sprawling novel&quot; called &quot;The King and the Sword&quot;.

In that book, the Comyn (although called &quot;the Seveners&quot;) were much the same as in later novels, with specific telepathic gifts. The seven families were the same, except the Altons were called the Leyniers and the Aillards were called the &quot;Marceau of Valeron&quot;, a name that Bradley changed after hearing of the book &quot;Skylark of Valeron&quot; by E. E. Smith, whom she admired.

Bradley was unable to sell &quot;The King and the Sword&quot;, even after she cut it down to &quot;500 manuscript pages&quot; and &quot;located the whole thing on an imaginary planet with a red sun&quot; in a &quot;Galactic Empire&quot;. However, she kept writing and eventually sold &quot;a shameless pastiche of a [Henry] Kuttner story&quot;, &quot;Falcons of Narabedla&quot;, to Ray Palmer, who had revived a magazine called &quot;Other Worlds&quot;. Palmer then accepted &quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot; for publication, but it was the version that had previously been called &quot;The King and the Sword&quot;. It is not the version published by Ace Books in &quot;1961 [sic, 1962] or thereabouts&quot;.

The first Darkover novel to be published was &quot;The Planet Savers&quot; in 1958, originally, Bradley thinks, in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Bradley wrote it when she was exploring the idea of multiple personalities, after reading &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; and some other stories that dealt with the concept. She says: &quot;So that a deeply repressed Terran Medic, Jay Allison, discovered himself in the personality of his repressed alternate who calls himself Jason&quot;. She placed the story on the planet she had created for &quot;The King and the Sword&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot;.

Bradley then published &quot;Seven from the Stars&quot; and &quot;The Door Through Space&quot;, also published as &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;. The latter is expressly said by Bradley to draw on the material that might be called &quot;Darkovan&quot;: &quot;&quot;The Door Through Space&quot; was a kind of replay of the old &quot;The King and the Sword&quot;&quot;. About the former, she does not say, but here is the number seven again.

Don Wollheim, who edited Ace Books, bought &quot;The Planet Savers&quot; for a reprint, through Bradley&#x27;s agent, Scott Meredith. Wollheim wanted another novel to print with it. Since Ray Palmer had never printed &quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot;, or paid Bradley for it, Bradley demanded that he either do that or return the manuscript to her. He returned it. Bradley rewrote it and sent it to Wollheim, who accepted it and the two novels became an Ace Double.

&quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award, to Bradley&#x27;s astonishment. She agrees with critics who say it is &quot;juvenile&quot;. She also says that later, when Don Wollheim wanted another science fiction book, she wrote a juvenile novel purposely: &quot;Star of Danger&quot;.

Bradley, on demand from publishers and fans, later created a backstory, amounting to an entire history of &quot;Darkover&quot;. As noted below, this history was not always self-consistent.

===Origins of the Chieri===
Bradley says that &quot;Yeats’ &quot;Irish Fairy and Folk Tales&quot; [sic, perhaps &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot;] and books by James Stephens&quot; probably suggested to her a race of non-humans like the &quot;Irish faery folk of Gaelic legend&quot;. After she read Tolkien, the &quot;chieri&quot; became more like Tolkien&#x27;s elves, but Bradley conceived of them as ambiguously sexed. She says this idea may have derived from Theodore Sturgeon, who wrote stories about legendary people who &quot;could appear as men to a woman, or as women to a man&quot;. Another influence was Maeterlink’s &quot;Pelleas and Melisande&quot;: she thought of Melisande as a lost fairy who could not find her way home.

After she wrote &quot;Star of Danger&quot;, Bradley began a science fiction novel about colonists who encountered these faery people, the &quot;chieri&quot;, one of which she had included in &quot;Star of Danger&quot;. This novel chronicled &quot;the attempts of this lost and alien race to interbreed with humans.&quot; She says it was not dissimilar to a novel by Vercors. She also says it was garbage and threw it all into the wastebasket before it had a good working title.

Bradley then realized that the &quot;chieri&quot; were a unisex race, sometimes male and sometimes female. She decided that the issue of sexuality was too difficult to handle in the current milieu of science fiction. She says, &quot;I had no desire to write the kind of story which would have to be published as pornography&quot;. In &quot;1970 or so&quot; she went to a science fiction convention (Boskone) and discussed writing with Anne McCaffrey.

Bradley told McCaffrey that she was tired of science fiction and wanted to write Gothics. She did not like the avant-garde novels she had lately read. In response to a question from McCaffrey, she answered that no, she had not read Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and she did not intend to. McCaffrey gave Bradley her own copy of that book, and Bradley read it and was &quot;spellbound&quot;. Walter Breen, after reading it himself, told Bradley: &quot;Now you can write that story about the &quot;chieri&quot; that you thought you couldn&#x27;t write&quot;.

Bradley then had the idea to write &quot;The World Wreckers&quot;. Edmond Hamilton had been called &quot;The ol&#x27; world wrecker&quot; because he destroyed planets, galaxies and even universes in his books. Norman Spinrad had written &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, but Bradley thought there must be more subtle ways to wreck a world, such as interfering with a fragile ecology. She also saw this book as the end of the &quot;Darkover&quot; series; a way to end it, like &quot;tossing Sherlock Holmes off the cliff at the Reichenbach Falls&quot;.

However, Bradley realized that she needed one fairly explicit sex scene to make the human-&quot;chieri&quot; interaction work. Don Wollheim reluctantly told her to go ahead, although he demanded that she use no profanity (which was not her intention anyway), and she demanded in return that he would not change it without consulting her. Bradley claims that the scene, which &quot;shocked some people and pleased others&quot;, was the first time the issue of homosexuality (not to mention sex-changing) had been dealt with directly in science fiction, and says, &quot;I managed to become something like science fiction&#x27;s token homosexual!&quot;

After the success of &quot;The World Wreckers&quot;, Don Wollheim was more willing to publish material that would have been considered controversial before. In particular, Bradley mentions &quot;How Are the Mighty Fallen&quot; by Thomas Burnett Swann. But every time Bradley said that the &quot;Darkover&quot; series was ended, friends, fans and casual readers objected, &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t do that!&quot;

==Themes==
Several themes are explored by Bradley at length within the books of the series. Psychic powers, treated as a science, are a theme that places the books firmly within the category of science fiction, even in the books that do not have &quot;Terrans&quot;, spaceships, or the &quot;Galactic Empire&quot;. They can also be called fantasy, because psychic powers appear to be &quot;out and out magic&quot;. Other themes are feminism, sexism, the roles of women in society, the roles of men in society, racism, social division (the Comyn nobility and the non-Comyn &quot;commoners&quot;), xenophobia and the clash of cultures, sexual taboos, fate and the horrors of war.

===Feminism===
According to Nasrullah Mambrol, &quot;though Bradley did not call herself a feminist, she was both criticized and applauded by those who have&quot;.

Bradley received much criticism for her book &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; because of the way the women of the incipient colony were treated. When the colonists realized that their spaceship would never fly again, the scientists said that for any colony to survive with a founding population of only a few hundred and no real hope of immigration, the greatest amount of genetic diversity must be maintained. That meant that women must have as many children as possible, by as many men as possible, and every child that survives is needed. The experts believed that miscarriages and infant deaths would be greater on a planet unlike Earth, although of course, this idea is unproven. Bradley was particularly criticized for the scene in which Camilla Del Rey is forbidden to have an abortion, although she wants one, because the child is needed for the colony&#x27;s survival.

In Bradley&#x27;s comment for the book: &quot;&quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; stirred up a furor because some outraged feminists objected to the stand I took in the book, that the survival of the human race on Darkover could, and should, be allowed to supersede the personal convenience of any single woman in the group. I have debated this subject ad nauseam in the fanzines, and I absolutely refuse to debate it again, but to those who refuse to accept the tenet that &quot;Biology is Destiny&quot;, I have begun to ask them to show me a vegetarian lion or tiger before they debate the issue further&quot;.

The notion of women as &quot;brood mares&quot; (and similar expressions) pervades the novels. Women have few rights, even at the time that the colony is found by the Terran Empire some thousands of years later, because they are still perceived as the bearers of children. The Comyn women are supposed to have children at least until they produce a male heir; the exception to this is in the Aillard Domain, where the head of the Domain runs in the female line. Most males who are not Comyn have similar ideas about the need for a male heir.

In the fictional Darkover world, the Renunciates may be the author&#x27;s reaction to this sexism. The Renunciates call themselves by that name because they renounce all loyalty to their clan or family and swear never to have a child because a man wants one. Bradley&#x27;s first novel in the Renunciates series, &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, describes the Renunciates and their principles, and begins with the rescue of a woman who is held against her will by a chieftain of the Dry Towns. Thus Bradley answered the criticisms that arose after the publication of &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;. Critics of the earlier work called &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot; a feminist novel; Joanna Russ placed it on a list of feminist utopias.

===Racism===
Racism as a concept is unknown on Darkover, because there are no races. All Darkovans are fair-skinned and have blue or grey eyes, except a few: for example, Marguerida Alton, who is the granddaughter of a &quot;chieri&quot;, has golden eyes. Brown-eyed Terrans are casually said to have &quot;animal eyes&quot;. This epithet is also applied to Lew Alton, who is Comyn, a member of the Alton clan, and a powerful telepath who possesses the Alton Gift. He has a Terran mother and his eyes are brown. Lew has a &quot;problem with identity&quot; that he never solves.

In &quot;City of Sorcery&quot;, Cholayna Ares, a dark-skinned Terran woman (actually from Alpha Centauri), is asked more than once if her dark skin is the result of a disease. There is no overt racism; Darkovans are simply curious because they have never seen anyone like her before. Bradley handles this issue with sensitivity and at times, wry and ironic humor, having Cholayna&#x27;s Darkovan friends (who are Renunciates) become outraged at the question.

This theme overlaps with &quot;Clash of Cultures&quot; because some Darkovans express a dislike for Terrans without giving a reason other than they have &quot;different ways&quot;.

===Clash of cultures===
Bradley says that the clash of cultures, Darkovan v. Terran, that she strengthened when rewriting &quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot;, was a &quot;theme of all the early &quot;Darkover&quot; novels&quot;.

According to Linda Leith, the opposition between the Terran and Darkovan civilizations is a theme of &quot;nearly all&quot; Darkover fiction. This opposition has the following pairs of contrary elements:

These contrary elements, as indicated, place Terra to Darkover in a relation of the same type as maleness to femaleness. While there are &quot;cross-overs in the fictions between the two columns&quot;, the general linking of Terra with the items in the first column and &quot;Darkover&quot; with the ones in the second enables the reader to &quot;understand what lies behind some of Bradley&#x27;s limitations as a writer&quot;. Neither society is presented as a utopia, Bradley seems confused about the value of each, and she &quot;is unable to make up her mind whether it is desirable for Terran influence to triumph once and for all&quot;.

Leith says that the opposition of cultures has an &quot;impressive simplicity&quot;. The Terrans are technologically advanced, liberal and imperialist. Darkover is non-technological (as far as the Terrans know) and feudal. The rational, scientific, and utilitarian Terran society, aimed at efficiency and practicality, placed on Darkover, which lacks these qualities, creates tension.

First, these two opposing cultures prove to have more in common than one suspects at first. Second, the contact between them brings about growth or a maturing process in each of them. Leith expresses the meaning of this cultural clash as &quot;to grow or to mature ultimately means to accept the element that has hitherto been missing, in short to reconcile the opposites in oneself&quot;. As an example, in &quot;The Forbidden Tower,&quot; Callista, a virgin untouchable Keeper who has renounced all family ties for the sake of being a Keeper, becomes Andrew&#x27;s wife. Damon&#x27;s challenge of the Tower norms and the rules that Keepers must follow helps Callista free herself from her rigid training. In addition, Andrew Carr must accept Darkovan culture and the fact that his relationship with Damon must be a closer one than Terran culture would allow.

The &quot;hope&quot; (Bradley&#x27;s hope, or the hope of the books) is that the opposites will merge and grow. In other books, Bradley creates more characters capable of crossing the gap between cultures, some of whom have mixed Terran-Darkovan parentage, or were removed from Darkover at a young age (Jeff Kerwin in &quot;The Bloody Sun&quot;), or Terrans who are able to join Darkovan society. 

Leith&#x27;s opinion is that Darkover is presented as weak compared to the Terran Empire. Darkover is the society that changes in response to Terran pressure, and it slowly but surely becomes less Darkovan.

===Fate===
In &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot; there is a brief mention, or appeal, to the theme of fate. In later books, both Darkovan and not Darkovan, Bradley explores her ideas in greater depth. In &quot;The Shattered Chain&quot;, Peter Haldane, a Terran, looks exactly like Rohana Ardais&#x27;s son, except for the lack of a sixth finger. When attempting Haldane&#x27;s rescue, disguised as a Renunciate on Rohana&#x27;s advice, Magdalen Lorne meets Jaelle, who is a Renunciate and Rohana&#x27;s niece. Jaelle is the one person who can expose Magda as a fake, because Magda claims to have the same oath-mother, which Jaelle knows is a lie. The remedy for masquerading as a Renunciate is to take the Renunciate&#x27;s oath and make the lie come true. Rohana does not think this is all coincidence; Bradley suggests there is a higher power at work.

Bradley often implies that fate is at work when a character uses the Darkovan proverb, &quot;The world will go as it will, not as you or I will have it&quot;, which appears in nearly all the &quot;Darkover&quot; books.

==Consistency==
Bradley says, in &quot;A Darkover Retrospective&quot;, that she does not really like &quot;series books&quot;. She also claims, &quot;I am simply not up to the kind of planning and long-range forethought that a &quot;series&quot; demands&quot;, such as Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Future History&quot; series. She mentions a fellow novelist who has a grand scheme worked out for 2000 years into the future, and every book must fit into the scheme. She thinks that is &quot;horrible&quot;.

Bradley says: &quot;So these are the ground rules for the Darkover books, series or not; every one is complete in itself, and I do not assume that the reader has read, or will ever read, any other book in the series&quot;. As an example of what she avoids, Bradley cites Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;Amber&quot; series, which led her to believe that it was soon to be resolved when she was reading it, but then it wasn&#x27;t. Another example is the cliffhanger ending of one of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s Barsoom books, &quot;where at the very end of the book the heroine ... was stolen away and popped into some kind of giant wheel with cubicles which moved at a fixed rate&quot; and &quot;John Carter and his sidekick were left staring at the giant wheel until the next book&quot;.

&quot;Also&quot;, Bradley says, &quot;... whenever consistency from book to book threatens to impair the artistic unity of any single book as a unit in itself, inter-book consistency will be relentlessly sacrificed... If I perpetuate anything in a Darkover book which I think could be altered for the better, I simply write it in the next book the way I think it ought to have been all along... I can&#x27;t imagine why readers should be bothered by this kind of thing&quot;.

In &quot;A Note from the Author&quot;, published with &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, Bradley says that she wrote the novels &quot;as they occurred to me&quot; instead of in &quot;strict chronological order&quot; and that, as a result, the chronologically earlier novels were written after the later ones, and were more mature. When she wrote &quot;The Heritage of Hastur&quot; she decided she would not be &quot;locked into&quot; the immature concepts of &quot;The Sword of Aldones&quot;, which she had &quot;dreamed up at the age of fifteen&quot;. She rewrote it as &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;.

Although the books written between 1958 and 1995 were intended to be stand-alone stories in accord with Bradley&#x27;s &quot;ground rules&quot;, with the publication of &quot;Exile&#x27;s Song&quot; the story was continued from book to book with &quot;The Shadow Matrix&quot; and &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot;. Adrienne Martine-Barnes was the uncredited co-author of these books. {The dedication of the ebook edition of Exile&#x27;s Song say &quot;For Adrienne Martine-Barnes, who created the character Margaret Alton, and worked on this book with me.&quot; Further, the copyright page of the ebook editions of &quot;The Shadow Matrix&quot; and &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot; both list Adrienne Martine-Barnes as co-copyright holder, along with Ms. Bradley.} . This broke Bradley&#x27;s &quot;ground rules&quot;. Bradley was at that time approaching the end of her life; she died in 1999, the same year that the third book of this &quot;trilogy&quot; was published.

==Chronology==
This Darkover chronology uses the time period designations first provided by the author as &quot;A Readers Guide to Darkover&quot; in &quot;The Heirs of Hammerfell&quot; (1989). Some of these time periods overlap, particularly the Ages of Chaos and the Hundred Kingdoms eras. It&#x27;s occasionally the case that the official readers guide places a book in one era, but internal plot evidence places it in another (or both). Additionally, Bradley was not particularly sympathetic to her fans&#x27; need to organize the books into a consistent chronology, and the timeline evidence from one book to another is sometimes in conflict. Commenting on this problem, Bradley wrote, &quot;I have fiercely resisted any attempt to impose absolute consistency, straightforward chronology, or anything but the most superficial order on the chronicles of Darkover&quot;. Furthermore, in the introduction to the &quot;Between the Ages&quot; section of &quot;Sword of Chaos&quot;, Bradley concedes, &quot;chronology in the Darkover novels was never my strong point anyway&quot;, after humorously quoting an old rhyme about a centipede who did not know &quot;which leg moved after which&quot;.

Bradley herself recommended that the books be read in the order in which they were written, rather than the Darkovan chronological order, as her writing style changed considerably over her career.

In &quot;The Planet Savers&quot;, Jason Allison says that the city of Carthon is 5000 years old (pg. 24). In &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;, the final sentence suggests that 2000 years elapsed between the colonization and rediscovery by the Terran Empire. In &quot;Sharra&#x27;s Exile&quot;, published in 1981, Lew Alton says, in the Prologue, &quot;Travel among the stars has strange anomalies; the enormous interstellar distances play strange tricks with time... The elapsed time on Terra was something like three thousand years. Yet elapsed time on Darkover was somehow more like ten thousand...&quot; This is but one example of inconsistency.

===The Founding===
At the end of the 21st century, Earth sends colony ships out to the stars. One of these ships becomes disabled and crash-lands on Darkover, the fourth planet in a red giant solar system. Unable to repair their ship and equally unable to make contact with Earth, the survivors establish a colony.

The colonists are primarily Celts and Spaniards, and this mix is reflected in the resultant blended culture. Bradley uses a standard &quot;lost colony&quot; trope: to maintain the available gene pool and maximize the chances of colonial survival, the colonists intermarry extensively and produce as many children with as many different partners as possible. Psychic and psionic abilities are acquired through interbreeding with the indigenous people, the &quot;Chieri&quot;.

Bradley is silent about the developments that followed the first generation of the colony, and does not make clear how many years intervene between the founding and the Ages of Chaos. The novels &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; and &quot;Rediscovery&quot; suggest that at least 2000 years have passed between the founding of the colony and Earth&#x27;s recontact. The last sentence of &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot; states, &quot;But Earth knew nothing of them for 2,000 years&quot;, but as Lew Alton says (above) the time on Darkover was perhaps 10,000 years.

* &quot;The Tower at New Skye&quot;, Priscilla W. Armstrong, &quot;Leroni of Darkover&quot;

===The Ages of Chaos===
Bradley&#x27;s books constantly refer back to the Ages of Chaos, but few books are actually set in this era. In this era, the descendants of the original colonists have organized themselves into a feudal-type society, with &quot;laran&quot; (psionic) abilities as the determiner of which individuals are part of the aristocracy and which are commoners. This period is marked by incredible creativity, the development of &quot;laran&quot;-based technology and weaponry, and the creation of the system of Towers, where those with exceptional &quot;laran&quot; abilities are housed and trained. All of these dominate political and social life. However these developments are accompanied by a period of nearly constant civil war, in which the Darkovans seem determined to exterminate themselves. Walter Breen&#x27;s &quot;The Darkover Concordance&quot; indicates that the Ages of Chaos period begins about a thousand years after the colonization of the planet and lasts a full thousand years.

Books describing this era: 
* &quot;Stormqueen!&quot; (1978 - by Marion Zimmer Bradley)
* &quot;Thunderlord!&quot; (2016 - by Deborah J. Ross)

===The Hundred Kingdoms===
Many of Bradley&#x27;s books, and a large number of the short stories, are set at the tail end of the &quot;Ages of Chaos&quot;, in a period she called the &quot;Hundred Kingdoms&quot;. The distinction between The Ages of Chaos and The Hundred Kingdoms is not well-defined, creating controversies about the chronology. By this era, the &quot;laran&quot; breeding programs had been abandoned, and the many small principalities were beginning to consolidate into the seven domains that survived into Darkover&#x27;s modern era. Bradley&#x27;s innovation, the adoption of &quot;The Compact&quot;, is a turning point in the development of Darkover&#x27;s social order. The Compact, promulgated by the recurring historical character Varzil the Good, bans all weapons that can be used without bringing the user into equal danger, effectively banning &quot;laran&quot; weapons, but allowing swords and knives. The Hundred Kingdoms may be read as commentary on the use of weapons of mass destruction in Earth&#x27;s own endless conflicts.

===Recontact (Against the Terrans: The First Age)===
Eventually Darkover is rediscovered by the Terran Empire, which establishes a spaceport, first at Caer Donn, and later at Thendara, the only large city on Darkover. This re-contact takes place a little more than 2,000 years after the events described in &quot;Darkover Landfall&quot;.

===Modern Darkover===
At the conclusion of &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot;, Bradley describes the Terrans abandoning their foothold on Darkover, and the restoration of Comyn control over the government. Books after &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Sun&quot; therefore fall in their own category, which the publisher is calling Modern Darkover.

* &quot;The Laran Gambit&quot; (2022 - written by Deborah J. Ross)

===The Renunciates===
In the introduction to &quot;Free Amazons of Darkover&quot;, Bradley wrote that her Renunciates have become &quot;the most attractive and controversial of my creations&quot;. The Guild of Oath-Bound Renunciates, called Free Amazons and &quot;com’hi letzii&quot; in earlier books, were women who had opted out of Darkover’s traditional gender-based roles, including marriage, obligations to clan, and the expectation of male protection.

The origins of this guild during the Hundred Kingdoms era are described in &quot;Two to Conquer&quot; as the merger between the Sisterhood of the Sword, a military-mercenary guild, and the Priestesses of Avarra, a cloistered order that offered medical and other care to women, primarily abused women. Towards the end of &quot;Two to Conquer&quot;, Carlina di Asturien comes to believe that the two guilds need to work together for the benefit of all women on Darkover. Bradley acknowledged a Patricia Matthews fan story as the origin of the Sisterhood of the Sword, and described the Priesthood of Avarra as a counterforce.

Bradley noted that most of the fan fiction she received was inspired by the Renunciates, that she had met individuals who had taken Renunciate-style names or were attempting to live in women&#x27;s communes inspired by the Renunciate guildhouses.

Books in the world of the Renunciates:

===Darkover anthologies===
In addition to novels, Bradley edited and published twelve short story anthologies in collaboration with other authors, known as the &quot;Friends of Darkover&quot;. The period of cooperative collaboration, which started in 1970, ended abruptly in 1992, when Bradley&#x27;s interaction with a fan rendered the novel &quot;Contraband&quot; legally unpublishable. The anthologies are now out of print owing to the publisher&#x27;s concerns regarding the ownership of the copyrights of the individual stories.

The stories in the anthologies stand apart from the novels and do not necessarily fit into the chronology above.

In the 1990 anthology, &quot;Domains of Darkover&quot;, Bradley stated that the only short stories that she considered part of the official &quot;Darkover&quot; canon, were those by herself, Diana L. Paxson and Elizabeth Waters, and a single story by Patricia Floss, &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot;. All of the other short stories published either in the anthologies or in fanzines she considered unofficial.

== Proposed TV series ==
A TV series based on the &quot;Darkover&quot; books was announced in 2012, and was to be produced by Ilene Kahn Power and Elizabeth Stanley. According to Deborah J. Ross, co-writer with Marion Zimmer Bradley on several Darkover novels and editor of related anthologies, the proposed series has been scrapped.

<doc id="937193" wikidata="Q237754" url="?curid=937193" title="Anna Amalia, Abbess of Quedlinburg">
<text>Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia (9 November 1723 – 30 March 1787) was an early modern German composer and music curator who served as princess-abbess of Quedlinburg. She was a princess of Prussia as the daughter of Frederick William I of Prussia and the sister of Frederick the Great.

== Early life (1723–1755) ==

Princess Anna &quot;Amalia&quot; of Prussia was born on 9 November 1723 in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia as the 12th child and 7th daughter of King Frederick William I (1688–1740) and his wife, born Princess Sophia Dorothea of Hanover (1687–1757). She had 13 siblings, 10 of whom survived infancy, including the future Frederick the Great (1712–1786). The Prussian royal children were raised in Berlin, where they lived in the Royal Palace (&quot;Königliches Schloss&quot;; today Berlin Palace/&quot;Berliner Schloss&quot;), but they also regularly spent time in the king&#x27;s favourite residence, a &quot;jagdschloss&quot; (&quot;hunting lodge&quot;) in Königs Wusterhausen.

Amalia was musically inclined, just like Crown Prince Frederick, but her formal instruction was only possible after the death of their abusive father who considered music to be decadent. Frederick William had an unpredictable temper, often dragging her across a room by her hair in a rage. Amalia&#x27;s childhood was overshadowed by her father: described as an uneducated, unpolished and spartan soldier, he was an alcoholic whose favourite hobby was smoking pipes with commoners, an extremely pious and narrow-minded Calvinist who loved his wife and was faithful to her, but behaved violently towards his whole family, courtiers, and anyone who upset him.

He preferred a simple life and only enjoyed German food and culture, detesting everything French. He thought that women are for breeding only and have to be completely submissive to their husbands. On the other hand, Queen Sophia Dorothea was a well-educated and ambitious woman who enjoyed theatre and balls and loved French culture and fashion. She entrusted the care of her children to a French staff, to which the king could not object as French was the language of international diplomacy. Music became Amalia&#x27;s secret consolation. She was first taught by Crown Prince Frederic with the support of their mother, and learned to play the harpsichord, the flute, and the violin.

The king was especially cruel to the crown prince as he considered his passion for music, literature and French culture unmanly. After many beatings and much humiliation, Frederick attempted to flee to their mother&#x27;s family in England in 1730, but was captured and court-martialed. For her part in the escape attempt, the king almost beat his eldest daughter Princess Wilhelmine (1709–1758) to death. Amalia was 7 years old at the time. In May 1740, Frederick William II died and Amalia&#x27;s eldest brother succeeded him as Frederick II.

=== Suggested marriage (1743–1744) ===
After Prince Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp (1710–1771) was elected heir of the childless king of Sweden, Frederick I in 1743, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden pursued an alliance. A marriage was suggested between the new Swedish crown prince and either Amalia or her elder sister Louisa Ulrika (1720–1782). Their brother King Frederick thought that Louisa Ulrika was too ambitious to be a good queen in a relatively powerless monarchy as Sweden was then in the Age of Liberty (1720–1772), a period of parliamentary governance. He described Amalia as mild and good-hearted and thus more suitable for the role. It has been suggested that he believed that Amalia would be easier to control as a Prussian agent in the Swedish court. However, the Swedish envoy preferred Louisa Ulrika, and she was married by proxy in July 1744.

== Abbess, composer, and music curator (1755–1787) ==

In 1755, after the death of the previous abbess, Duchess Marie Elisabeth of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp (1678–1755), Amalia was elected princess-abbess of the Free Secular Imperial Abbey of Quedlinburg (German: &quot;Kasierlich Freie Weltliche Reichsstift Quedlinburg&quot;), which made her a wealthy and influential woman with the right to sit and speak in the Imperial Diet. She spent most of her time in Berlin and devoted herself to music, becoming known as a patron and composer. In 1758, she started studying music theory and composition from Johann Kirnberger(1721–1783), a student of Johann Sebastian Bach.

She achieved modest fame and is most known for her chamber music, including trios, marches, cantatas, songs, and fugues. Her favourite among her own compositions was the passion cantata &quot;Der Tod Jesu&quot; (&quot;The Death of Jesus&quot;), based on a poem by Karl Wilhelm Ramler. Only a few of her works have survived and she may have destroyed many of her own compositions, as she described herself as very timid and self-critical. More compositions by her may surface as a result of the 2000 discovery of the archives of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin in Kyiv which had been lost since World War II.

Amalia also collected music, preserving over 600 volumes by Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Georg Philipp Telemann, Carl Heinrich Graun and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, among others. Her library was split between East Germany and West Germany after World War II and reunited after the German reunification of 1990. Today it is housed in the Berlin State Library.

Princess-abbess Anna Amalia died on 30 March 1787 at the age of 63 and was buried in Berlin Cathedral. She was succeeded by her niece, Princess Sophia Albertina of Sweden (1753–1829).

=== Selected compositions ===

==== Sonata in F Major (for Flute and Basso Continuo) (1771) ====
I. Adagio, II. Allegretto, III. Allegro ma non troppo

Her flute sonata is maybe Amalia&#x27;s most well-known composition. It has a duration of about 11 minutes.

==== Harpsichord Concerto in G major ====
I. Allegro, G minor, II. Andantino, C major, III. Allegro, G major

The concerto is scored for solo harpischord, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, and strings. It is written for a chamber orchestra and can be played with as few as one person per part, with a duration of around 13 minutes. It has a well-integrated solo part, and the second movement is mainly orchestral. The finale resembles a minuet with a trio featuring wind solos.

==== Divertimento in B-flat major (circa 1780) ====
I. Adagio, B-flat major, II. Allegro, B flat major

The &quot;divertimento&quot; shows a possible influence by Mozart and might be the first chamber music featuring a clarinet. It opens with a &quot;tutti&quot; part and is then led by the viola.

Based on the title page of the Divertimento (from IMSLP.org), it was actually composed by Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel

<doc id="937198" wikidata="Q141441" url="?curid=937198" title="Paraguay at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Paraguay competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s ninth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of its partial support to the United States boycott.

Comité Olímpico Paraguayo sent the nation&#x27;s largest delegation to the Games since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona due to the presence of the men&#x27;s football team. A total of 23 athletes, 21 men and 2 women, competed only in athletics, football, rowing, and swimming. The Paraguayan team featured two notable female athletes: javelin thrower Leryn Franco, who aspired to be one of the most beautiful women to compete at the Olympics because of her professional career as a model and beauty contestant, and single sculls rower Rocio Rivarola, aged seventeen, who later became the nation&#x27;s first ever female flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Paraguay left Athens with its first Olympic silver medal from the men&#x27;s football team, following its defeat against Argentina with a score of 0–1 in the final match of the tournament.

==Medalists==


==Athletics==

Paraguayan athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

<doc id="937202" wikidata="Q1001654" url="?curid=937202" title="Lightning Ridge, New South Wales">
<text>Lightning Ridge is a small outback town in north-western New South Wales, Australia. Part of Walgett Shire, Lightning Ridge is situated near the southern border of Queensland, about east of the Castlereagh Highway. The Lightning Ridge area is a centre of the mining of black opal and other opal gemstones.

==Indigenous inhabitants==
The traditional owners of the land around Lightning Ridge are the Yuwaalaraay people. Yuwaalayaay (also known as &quot;Yuwalyai, Euahlayi, Yuwaaliyaay, Gamilaraay, Kamilaroi, Yuwaaliyaayi&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuwaalayaay country. It is closely related to the Gamilaraay and Yuwaalaraay languages. The Yuwaalayaay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Balonne, including the town of Dirranbandi as well as the border town of Goodooga extending to Walgett and the Narran Lakes in New South Wales.&quot;&quot;

After they were displaced by the establishment of colonial pastoral stations, many Yuwaalaraay people stayed on as labourers, but were increasingly dispersed in the early 20th century. In 1936, several indigenous families living at a local government settlement were forced to move to the Brewarrina settlement.

==European settlement==
By the mid 1800s, British colonialists settled in the area, initially using the land for pastoral activities.

The name Lightning Ridge is said to have originated when in the 1870s, some passers-by found the bodies of a farmer, his dog, and 200 sheep, which had been struck by lightning.

Europeans did not discover the potential for opal mining in Lightning Ridge until the late 1800s. In 1905, the first shafts were dug, with the unique Black Opal soon attracting attention of fossickers in established mining towns such as White Cliffs. Charlie Nettleton an early pioneer in the area, walked from White Cliffs to see the Black Opal, walking back to White Cliffs the following year with Jack Murray to develop a market and selling black opals to Ted Murphy, who later became the first resident opal buyer in Lightning Ridge. Nettleton, now regarded as the founder of the black opal industry, is commemorated with a life-sized bronze statue, the &quot;Spirit of Lightning Ridge&quot;; it is located in the town at 7 Morilla Street.

==Population==
At the 2001 census, the town had a population of 1,826, of whom 344 (18.8%) were Indigenous Australians. The population is said to be highly variable, as transient miners come and go over time. Prior to the 2004 public inquiry into the functioning of Walgett Shire, it worked on the basis that about 7,000 people were in the town, but the enquiry found that this estimate was not supported by the 2001 census and contrasted with the 1,109 people who voted in the town at the local government elections in 2004. At the 2006 census, the population of Lightning Ridge had increased to 2,602 people.

By the 2016 census the population had fallen slightly to 2,284, with a median age of 51. 
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 22.7% of the population. 
* About 69.2% of people were born in Australia, with other top countries of birth being England 1.9%, Germany 1.5%, and the Philippines 1.4%. 
* Around 79.1% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for languages other than English included Serbian 2.4%, German 1.2%, and Croatian 0.9%. 
* The most common responses for religion were no religion 29.3%, Anglican 22.1%, and Catholic 18.7%. Christianity was the largest religious group reported overall (62.9%).

The town was listed as one of the poorest places in the state according to the 2015 &quot;Dropping Off The Edge&quot; report.

==Climate==
Lightning Ridge has a hot semiarid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification.

==Activities==
The Lightning Ridge Opal and Gem Festival takes place yearly. The town has a five-star Olympic pool, which features a diving complex, a rock climbing wall, and water theme park that operates during the summer holidays. Parts of the pool are protected by shade, and the complex has barbecue facilities. The Ella Nagy Youth Centre opened in 2000; it features a skatepark. Until 2011, Lightning Ridge hosted an annual goat race in the town&#x27;s main street and a rodeo on the Easter long weekend. Goats were harnessed and driven by children, much like harness racing in equine sports. The goat races were accompanied by wheelie-bin races, and horse racing the following day.

Local football team the Lightning Ridge Redbacks play in the Group 15 Barwon Darling Rugby League competition. 

Lightning Ridge is home to the St George Serbian Orthodox Church with a travelling priest from Brisbane attending several times a year to conduct mass.

==Arts==

Some artists have settled in and around Lightning Ridge. One of the most famous local Australian painters is John Murray, who brings the impressions of the Outback, often in a situation with man or fauna onto the canvas.

==Fossils==
Lightning Ridge is an important paleontological site, with opalised fossils dating back to the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago, deriving from the Griman Creek Formation. The site is especially important as a source of fossils of ancient mammals, which, at that time, were small creatures living in a world dominated by dinosaurs. The fossils are sometimes opalised and discovered by opal miners. Important discoveries at Lightning Ridge include the ancestral monotremes &quot;Kollikodon ritchiei&quot; and &quot;Steropodon galmani&quot;. In June 2019, a new species of dinosaur, &quot;Fostoria dhimbangunmal&quot; was described from fossils retrieved from Lightning Ridge. The plant-eating species lived at least 100 million years ago. It is the most complete dinosaur fossil to be found preserved as opal.

==Fossicking==
Since August 1992 when the Mining Act 1992 commenced, fossicking licences have not been required for fossicking in New South Wales.

Under the terms of this act, fossicking may now be carried out anywhere in the state providing these conditions are met:

*No other act or law applies which would prevent it
*The landholder&#x27;s consent is obtained
*The consent of any public or local authority having the management, control, or trusteeship of the land is obtained
*The titleholder&#x27;s consent is also obtained, where the location is covered by a current title under the Mining Act 1992 (This title may be an exploration licence, assessment lease, mining lease, mineral claim or Opal Prospecting Licence).

==Water==
Lightning Ridge has an abundance of hot water from a bore spring into the Great Artesian Basin and offers two hot-water pools for bathing. The public can tap mineral water at a hose in Harlequin Street. The Hot Artesian Bore Baths and Nettletons Shaft, on McDonald&#x27;s Six Mile Opal Field, have been placed on the Register of the National Estate.

== Media ==
The town is serviced by three radio stations. Opal FM on 89.7 MHz, Outback Radio 2WEB on 90.5 MHz and 2CUZ FM on 96.1 MHz.

&quot;The Western Herald&quot; is published on a weekly basis (every Thursday) year-round, except during a short break at Christmas and covers local Lightning Ridge Stories.

==Notable residents==
Australian comedian, actor and television presenter Paul Hogan claimed to be from Lightning Ridge to improve his chances to appear on Australian talent contest &quot;New Faces&quot;, but was actually born in the suburbs of Sydney. As the myth helped drive tourism to Lightning Ridge, Hogan has avoided correcting the record.

Tyrone Lindqvist of Rüfüs Du Sol grew up in Lightning Ridge.

A legitimate native of Lightning Ridge is current Australia women&#x27;s rugby union international Bella McKenzie.

<text>&quot;Someplace Good&quot; is a song in the album &quot;Eclectic Alternative&quot; produced by Bad Ass Music. Its popularity surged greatly in Hong Kong because it is used as a background music in the comedy, &quot;To Catch the Uncatchable&quot;, made by TVB.

The song&#x27;s sad feeling and the drama&#x27;s unexpected sorrowful ending amplified each other greatly, leaving a deep impression on the audience. 
Following the end of the show (22 August 2004), some Hong Kong-based Internet forums questioned the origin of the song, which was finally found a few days later. However, the album was impossible to obtain in Hong Kong, leaving a lot of people disappointed. In 2006, the American TV Channel AMC used the song as an interlude promoting movies shown on its network.</text><links>

<doc id="937210" wikidata="Q944752" url="?curid=937210" title="Fable (2004 video game)">
<text>Fable is an action role-playing video game, the first in the &quot;Fable&quot; series. It was developed for the Xbox, Windows, and Mac OS X platforms by Big Blue Box Studios, a satellite developer of Lionhead Studios, and was published by Microsoft Studios. The game shipped for the Xbox in September 2004. An extended version of the game, Fable: The Lost Chapters, was released for the Xbox and Windows in September 2005. A port of the game for Mac OS X, created by Robosoft Technologies and published by Feral Interactive, was released in March 2008 after a delay of more than two years due to licensing issues.

Taking place in a fantasy world called Albion, players control an unnamed hero who joins the Heroes Guild after losing his family during a bandit attack on his hometown. Upon leaving the guild, the player is given a choice to decide whether the hero should live up to his name, or guide him on a path of darkness. 

Originally developed under the name &quot;Project Ego&quot;, &quot;Fable&quot;″s development involved more than 150 people. The game&#x27;s music was composed by Russell Shaw, with the opening title theme written by Danny Elfman. The game&#x27;s release was widely anticipated, due in part to Lionhead co-founder Peter Molyneux&#x27;s enthusiastic hype of the game. The game was originally in development for the Dreamcast, but shifted to the Xbox after the Dreamcast was discontinued. Through Xbox Live, Fable supported the Live Aware feature. &quot;Fable&quot; is now supported again on the replacement Xbox online servers called Insignia.

&quot;Fable&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics for the quality of its gameplay and execution, though the failure to include many promised features was noted. &quot;Fable&quot; was the top-selling game of September 2004 and sold more than two million units by 2006. The game was followed by two sequels, &quot;Fable II&quot; in 2008, &quot;Fable III&quot; in 2010 and a reboot in development by Playground Games. &quot;Fable Anniversary&quot;, a high-definition remake of the game that includes &quot;The Lost Chapters&quot;, was released for the Xbox 360 and Windows in February 2014.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Fable&quot; is a role-playing video game where players control their character from a third-person perspective. The main character, known as The Hero of Oakvale, can interact with people and objects as well as battle foes. The goal of &quot;Fable&quot; is to complete missions called quests that advance the game&#x27;s plot, but &quot;Fable&quot; also features optional quests and allows players to pursue actions not directly tied to story completion.

Most quests are acquired at a central location, known as the Heroes&#x27; Guild; required quests are marked with a gold symbol and advance the game&#x27;s story, while optional quests are coloured silver and can be completed in any order. Some quests allow players to pick sides and aid either evil characters, such as bandits, or good characters, such as traders and guardsmen. Players can also boast after accepting a quest, wagering some of the quest&#x27;s reward gold in exchange for a larger return if the player accomplishes their bet, such as sustaining no damage or undertaking the quest naked. Gold, which can be used to buy weapons and items, and renown, which affects the way townspeople react to the Hero. Heroes also earn trophies of their victories, which can be displayed to large groups of townspeople to earn more renown.

In addition to fighting with melee weapons (such as swords and maces) and ranged weapons (longbows and crossbows), Heroes can learn and use spells to empower their abilities, ward off damage, or harm foes. As players complete quests or defeat enemies, they gain general experience as well as experience based on whether they used melee attacks, ranged weapons, or magic; these bestow Strength, Skill, and Will experience, respectively. Experience can be spent at a platform in the Heroes&#x27; Guild to level up attributes. General experience can be used to modify all groups of attributes. Strength experience can only be used to modify three attributes: Physique, Health, and Toughness. The same applies to Skill which can only modify Speed, Accuracy, and Guile. Will can be used to upgrade player&#x27;s total magic power or to learn and upgrade spells which are broken into three groups, Attack Spells, Surround Spells, and Physical Spells. The experience the main character gains can be multiplied during combat through the combat multiplier. As the character successfully hits an enemy, his combat multiplier increases. If the character is hit by the enemy, the combat multiplier drops down to the next multiple of five, or zero if below five.

&quot;Fable&quot;″s game world is dotted with towns where recreational activities not related to combat can be undertaken. Enterprising Heroes can buy trade items such as beer kegs or grain sacks and sell them at other towns for profit. Towns are also prime locations to buy clothing, weapons, or other items. Many towns have houses for sale, which the Hero can buy, furnish, or lease to tenants for gold. Heroes may woo and marry men or women in each town.

===Alignment===

In &quot;Fable&quot;, a player&#x27;s Hero has a measure of good or evil alignment based on the Hero&#x27;s actions. Good deeds award good points, which produce a positive alignment, while committing evil acts adds evil points, producing a negative alignment. Killing monsters or saving villagers are acts of good, whereas killing innocents, breaking laws, or abusing a spouse will accumulate evil points. Consuming certain foodstuffs can also affect the Hero&#x27;s alignment; for example, eating tofu will earn the hero positive points, while eating crunchy chicks (because crunchy chicks are assumed to be still alive) will earn evil points. The player may also pray at the temples of Avo and Skorm. Donations to the Temple of Avo will result in good points, while &quot;gifts&quot; to the Chapel of Skorm will result in evil points. The alignment affects not only the responses of non-player characters around the Hero, but also the appearance of the Hero himself. A Hero with a strongly positive alignment will feature a halo and a shaft of sparkling light above his head, butterflies fluttering around him and lighter features. An evil Hero emits a red haze from around his legs, draws flies, has glowing red eyes and grows horns.

Other actions besides alignment affect the Hero. Eating too much causes the character to gain weight,
while drinking excessive amounts of beer causes Heroes to become sick and vomit. Clothing, which provides defence in combat situations, also changes the Hero&#x27;s attractiveness or scariness as well as alignment in some cases, and townspeople&#x27;s reactions to the Hero accordingly. Bright clothing makes the character look more noble to the townspeople, and thus cause them to praise and respect him. Dark clothing causes the character to seem evil or threatening to townspeople and cause them to fear him. Heroes can be further customised via hairstyles, facial hair, and tattoos. The Hero&#x27;s attributes also affect appearance; high levels of Strength increase brawn, high levels of skill increase height, and high-level spells create glowing arcane patterns on the Hero&#x27;s body.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
&quot;Fable&quot; takes place in Albion, a patchwork of city-states with lawless stretches of plains and forest between them. The entire land was once led by an ancient royal bloodline, bestowed with the title of Archon, referred to as the &quot;Old Kingdom&quot;. The first Archon&#x27;s rule was peaceful and prosperous, but the source of his power was an ancient and powerful sword (the Sword of Aeons) that gradually began to corrupt him and, eventually, his entire kingdom. By the time the events of the game take place, the world has slowly deteriorated from the days of the Old Kingdom. One of the most prominent institutions of Albion is the Heroes&#x27; Guild. The Guild is a centre of learning and training for Heroes, renowned mercenaries that are active in all parts of Albion. Heroes are hired as thieves, soldiers, guards, rescuers, and protectors; the Guild makes no moral judgement on the actions of its Heroes.

===Plot===

On his sister&#x27;s birthday, a young boy&#x27;s village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy&#x27;s father and abducting his mother and sister. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy and recruits him to be trained as a Hero at an academy called the Heroes&#x27; Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero&#x27;s surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.

Later on in the Hero&#x27;s life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/roommate back in the Guild—Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.

The Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero&#x27;s childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack, having once more kidnapped Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades&#x27; death.

Depending on the Hero&#x27;s alignment and the player&#x27;s choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.

In &quot;The Lost Chapters&quot; special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword &quot;Avo&#x27;s Tear&quot;, a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack&#x27;s mask to trap Jack&#x27;s soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask—being consumed by Jack in the process—or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.

==Development==

&quot;Fable&quot; was the first game developed by Big Blue Box, a satellite studio of Peter Molyneux&#x27;s Lionhead. Dene and Simon Carter, Big Blue Box&#x27;s founders, stated that their first project would have to meet several criteria in order to be accepted by game publishers, but that they weren&#x27;t interested in producing a generic title. To offset the costs of running a fledgling studio, Molyneux proposed Lionhead &#x27;satellites&#x27;, where Big Blue Box would receive the technology and support of Lionhead so that Big Blue Box could focus on making the game. After some difficulty in finding a willing publisher, Big Blue Box was offered a contract by Microsoft. According to the Carters, they wanted to create a role-playing game like no other:
The world would be a breathtakingly beautiful place filled with waterfalls, mountains, dense forests, populated with compelling and convincing characters with real personality, people who actually reacted to what you did. We wanted to give the player control of a hero who would adapt to the way they played, who would age, become scarred in battle, who could get tattoos, wear dreadlocks and a dress if the player was so inclined. We wanted each and every person who played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell. And we called it &quot;Thingy.&quot;

Early in &quot;Fable&quot;″s development, the game had many titles from &quot;Wishworld&quot; to &quot;Project Ego&quot;.

The game took roughly four years to create, with a team of around 70 developers working on it. The main ideas that constituted the entire development of &quot;Fable&quot; were that the hero visually reflects his experience and that the world reacts in a manner appropriate to the player&#x27;s actions.

Peter Molyneux aggressively promoted &quot;Fable&quot;, at one point stating that &quot;it&#x27;s gonna be the best game ever&quot;.

&quot;Fable&quot; previews noted that the somewhat absurd humour and atmosphere of the game, which &quot;GamePro&quot; called &quot;Terry Pratchett or Piers Anthony fantasy&quot; was far different from what was seen on contemporary RPGs.

With the exception of the title theme, &quot;Fable&quot;″s music was composed by Russell Shaw, who had previously worked on Molyneux games such as &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; and &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;. The job for composing &quot;Fable&quot;″s theme music was given to Danny Elfman. Elfman noted in an interview that Hollywood composers did not typically cross over to video game work, in part because many game developers wanted a synthesised score that sounds like an orchestra, instead of the real thing. At Elfman&#x27;s insistence, the developers used a small orchestra, which Shaw noted was much more of a challenge than previous projects: &quot;There are more people involved (even without considering the orchestra), and the complexities of any music interactivity are brought to the fore.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Fable&quot; was expanded and re-released as &quot;Fable: The Lost Chapters&quot; for Xbox and Windows PC platforms in September 2005. The game was later ported to Mac OS X by Robosoft Technologies and published by Feral Interactive on 31 March 2008.

&quot;The Lost Chapters&quot; features all the content found in the original &quot;Fable&quot;, as well as additional new content such as new monsters, weapons, alignment-based spells, items, armour, towns, buildings, and expressions, as well as the ability to give children objects. The story receives further augmentation in the form of nine new areas and sixteen additional quests. Characters such as Briar Rose and Scythe, who played only minor roles in the original game, are now given more importance and are included in certain main and side quests. Other character-based augmentations include the voice of the antagonist, Jack of Blades, sounding deeper, harsher and more demonic, and the ability to uncover (and resolve) the murder mystery of Lady Grey&#x27;s sister.
The updated edition of the game also applied fixes for certain glitches, such as the &quot;dig glitch&quot;, in which the protagonist would move backward each time he used the shovel, pushing him through solid objects and sometimes trapping him.

===Sales===
&quot;Fable&quot; was a commercial success upon release, selling 375,000 copies during its first week, and 600,000 copies in the first month. Sales rose to 1.4 million copies by March 2005. By July 2006, its Xbox version had sold 1.5 million copies and earned $58 million in the United States alone. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 29th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. The game has sold around three million copies worldwide.

==Reception==
&quot;Fable&quot; received positive reviews from both audiences and critics. The original Xbox version of the game has an aggregate critic score of 85% at both Metacritic and GameRankings. The game won more than fifty awards, and became the Xbox&#x27;s fastest-selling game up to that time. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Fable&quot; with outstanding achievement in &quot;Original Musical Composition&quot; and &quot;Character or Story Development&quot;, as well as nominations for &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming&quot; and outstanding achievement in &quot;Game Design&quot; and &quot;Gameplay Engineering&quot;. 

&quot;Fable&quot;″s combat was praised. Staff from &quot;1UP.com&quot; complimented the multiple approaches to combat which the publication stated made the game more a mini-game of its own: &quot;Combat becomes its own minigame, with the goal not solely to beat a foe, but to beat it with skill and get the most from every fight. Slaughter becomes irrelevant, and the fights never become tedious.&quot;

Though pointing out several flaws in the game such as bland character designs, Marc Saltzman of &quot;USAToday.com&quot; stated that the game &quot;should satisfy you with its incredible depth, open-ended game play, and a solid story that gets even better about half-way through the adventure&quot;. &quot;Fable&quot; has been praised for its concept of free will and having consequences for the Hero&#x27;s actions. Other aspects of the game positively received included the game&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek characters and what &quot;The Observer&quot; called a &quot;very British sense of humour, in the style of Monty Python or Douglas Adams&quot;.

The short length of the main plot was criticised by reviewers, but many overlooked this due to the much larger array of side quests available to the player.
One of the complaints that arose upon the release of &quot;Fable&quot; was the fact that it failed to include features that Peter Molyneux had mentioned while the game was still in development. One of the features that were not included in the game&#x27;s release was the Hero&#x27;s ability to have children despite the fact that Molyneux had previously mentioned that the Hero&#x27;s own children would be significant in the game. Molyneux reacted to these complaints by means of a public apology posted on the official Lionhead forums, on which he said: &quot;If I have mentioned any feature in the past [that], for whatever reason, didn&#x27;t make it as I described into &quot;Fable&quot;, I apologise.&quot; This issue was addressed in &quot;Fable II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, both of which include the ability to have children.

The PC and Xbox versions of &quot;Fable: The Lost Chapters&quot; were also well-received, with slightly lower Metacritic and GameRankings averages than the original title. Reviewers such as Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that the addition of new content helped prevent the game from becoming stale. &quot;1UP.com&quot; previewed the game and found that the additive content didn&#x27;t redefine &quot;Fable&quot;, but helped bulk up the available quests, addressing the complaint of how short the original &quot;Fable&quot; was. &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; judged &quot;The Lost Chapters&quot; on PC as surpassing its console predecessor.
In 2005, a Microsoft Game Studios representative stated that &quot;Fable&quot; would be among the franchises that would appear on the next-generation Xbox 360. Sequels &quot;Fable II&quot; and &quot;Fable III&quot; were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.
===&quot;Fable Anniversary&quot;===

Lionhead Studios announced &quot;Fable Anniversary&quot;, a remastered version of &quot;Fable: The Lost Chapters&quot;, for release on the Xbox 360 later in 2013. It features overhauled graphics and audio, a new save system and incorporates Achievements. &quot;Fable Anniversary&quot; was in full development for 15 months. The game featured graphical upgrades in many areas over the original most notably; native widescreen support, higher polygon count, larger textures, specular maps, normal maps, improved lighting, improved shadows, and a larger draw/detail distance.

It was released on Steam on 12 September 2014 and includes mod support. Upon release, it garnered mixed reviews. Many reviewers praised the new graphics, but bemoaned that old bugs from the previous version of the game had not been fixed, including freezing at a very frequent cadence. It received 68% on the review aggregation website Metacritic.

<text>Banshay (, ) is a weapon-based martial art from Myanmar focusing primarily on the sword, staff and spear. Influenced by both Indian and Chinese sources, it is closely related to similar Southeast Asian systems such as Thai krabi krabong, Cambodian kbach kun boran and Malay silat.

Banshay makes extensive use of the dha (sword) in pairs. Sword-fencing demonstrations and performances often begin with a pre-fight war dance in which the swordsman spins one or two swords very close to the body without cutting themselves.

There are 37 sword forms. Sword training is conducted with the weapon still sheathed. Traditionally when a master first presents the student with a sword, the scabbard would be fixed on so that the trainee is discouraged from killing opponents. Under extreme conditions when the sword must be unsheathed, the scabbard may be broken with a rock or other object.

<text>Naban (, ) is a traditional form of grappling from Myanmar. Naban is integrated into other fighting styles instead of existing as a separate martial art. Originally based on Indian wrestling, it is practiced primarily in rural areas. Naban is especially popular among the Kachin and Chin tribes that have Himalayan origins. Techniques include joint locks, strikes to pressure points, palm strikes, foot strikes and chokeholds. Any part of the opponent&#x27;s body is a legal target.

<text>Dirranbandi is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Balonne, Queensland, Australia. The locality is on the border of Queensland with New South Wales. In the , the locality of Dirranbandi had a population of 610 people.

== Geography ==
Dirranbandi is on the Castlereagh Highway and the Balonne River. It is notable for the population variations each year as seasonal workers come to work on the extensive cotton fields. Due to the low annual rainfall, irrigation is used extensively.

== History ==
Gamilaraay (also known as Gamilaroi, Kamilaroi, Comilroy) is an Aboriginal language from south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales. The Gamilaraay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Balonne Shire Council, including the towns of Dirranbandi, Thallon, Talwood and Bungunya as well as the border towns of Mungindi and Boomi extending to Moree, Tamworth and Coonabarabran in NSW.

Yuwaalaraay (also known as &quot;Yuwalyai, Euahlayi, Yuwaaliyaay, Gamilaraay, Kamilaroi, Yuwaaliyaayi&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuwaalaraay country.

The town reserve was surveyed in March 1885 by surveyor Claudius Buchanan Whish. He is believed to have named the town using an Aboriginal word, meaning either &quot;broken forest country&quot; or &quot;chorus of frogs at night&quot;. The name may be derived from a Yuwaaliyaay dialect placename, &quot;Dhurrunbandaay&quot;, relating to &quot;dhurrun.gal&quot; (&quot;hairy caterpillars&quot;) and &quot;baanda-y&quot; (&quot;move in single file&quot;).

<doc id="937220" wikidata="Q13582468" url="?curid=937220" title="Lerdrit">
<text>Lerdrit, Muay Lert Rit or, Leert Rit (มวย Muay: boxing, fighting เลิศ leert: superior, excellent ฤทธิ์ rit: formidable force, colossal power) is the generic name attributed to the set of principles and fighting techniques employed by Siamese warriors for centuries on Southeast Asian battlefields. This form of Muay has been used primarily by the Royal Thai Army’s Palace Guard, the Capital’s Defense Corps, war elephants’ Defense Units and Special Infantry Corps. Siamese Lert Rit was based on a clever combination of the Nine Natural Weapons (Nawarthawooth), i.e., hands, feet, knees, elbows and head, which were used to attack and defend. It was also based on the four ancestral strategies used by Special Infantry Corps: Tum (throwing to the ground), Tap (crush), Chap (grab), Hak (break the joints). Muay of today is a traditional martial art born from the ancestral precepts of Siamese warriors, adapted to the self-defence needs of modern practitioners, regardless of their physical characteristics and the conditions under which its techniques are applied. However, several Western martial arts practitioners have developed modern adaptations that combine elements of Muay Thai with those of other martial arts which they now market as Muay Boran. 

== Technical features ==
Leert Rit fighting strategy places great emphasis on close range striking, executed using hard body parts such as: the heel and outside edge of the hands, the legs (heel, shin bone), the knees, the elbows and the skull. The trainee is trained to hit and quickly take the opponent down, so as to efficiently apply a pin or a finishing move. The vital points of the body are identified from the first training sessions, in order to train students to attack with ease and to swiftly defend the weakest areas of one’s anatomy.

Practice emphasizes powerful short range attacks that employ the Nine Natural Weapons; body conditioning is included in every training session and is designed to increase bone density and muscle and tendon strength, making the trainee’s body stronger. Thai style grappling (Muay Pram) is the core practice for every Muay student: working out with non-compliant training partners is mandatory in order to learn how to fight at close range. All Muay students are trained to apply holds, strikes, take downs and finishing moves at a very short distance from the opponent. Psycho-physical stress is generated in a controlled environment, so as to reproduce conditions of real-life aggression.

<doc id="937221" wikidata="Q2285540" url="?curid=937221" title="Sikaran">
<text>Sikaran is a Filipino Martial Art that involves hand and mostly foot fighting.
As Sikaran is a general term for &quot;kicking&quot; which is also used as the name of the kicking aspects of other Filipino Martial arts, this article discusses the distinct art which is specifically practiced in the Rizal province that focuses almost exclusively in kicking.
==Definition==
Sikaran comes from the root word &quot;sikad&quot; which means &quot;kick&quot; in Tagalog, Capampangan (e.g. &quot;sikaran daka&quot; - &quot;I&#x27;m going to kick you&quot;), as well as Cebuano (e.g. &quot;sikaran tika&quot;).

==History==
Sikaran is a simple but intense martial art game that originated from the town of Baras, in the province of Rizal. According to the forefathers of Baras, it had been practiced long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines in the 16th century.

It is noted that like most Filipino martial arts, Sikaran has no written history as traditional Filipino knowledge is passed orally from generation to generation.

Like many Filipino martial arts styles, it has been endangered as it does not have as many practitioners as the more mainstream martial arts. Like Modern Arnis, in the mid-20th century, it had to adapt certain structural aspects of the more well known art of karate like the belting system, choreographed forms or katas and uniforms to make it more appealing other Filipinos and be more accepted internationally.

==Fighting Style==

Sikaran has its own distinct kicking styles. The signature &quot;Biakid&quot; kick is executed by pivoting to the back in a complete turn, much like a spinning hook kick or a reverse round house in other martial arts styles and targets the side or back of the head while the practitioner is in mid to punching range.

The degree of effectiveness subscribes to two classifications: &quot;panghilo&quot; (paralyzing blow) and &quot;pamatay&quot; or lethal kick. Obviously, the first aimed at less vital parts of the physique, while the target of the second includes the heart, neck, head, groin, and spine, all highly vulnerable parts.

Footage from the Last Man Standing UK TV series episode on Sikaran (YouTube link, uploaded by the Sikaran group featured) shows how the style practiced in the province is done differently from Korean Taekwondo and Japanese Karate. There have been questions on the art of Sikaran as being native to the Philippines or being borrowed from Karate and Tae Kwon Do, but as can be seen in the Last Man Standing footage, to the farmers watching the sport and cheering on the sidelines, it is simply an ordinary sight common to their particular village, much like Sabong (cockfighting) is in the rest of the Philippines.

==Sport==
Sikaran utilizes only the feet as a rule for sport, and the hands are only used for blocking, leg sweeps and throwing an opponent is also a part of the martial art. The player uses his legs 90% of the time and his hands 10%, and only for blocking or parrying blows. Violation of this injunction, especially in tournaments, is grounds for disqualification.

The entry of Sikaran in tournaments, particularly those of international calibre, presaged certain modifications, if innovations, of its original rules, like the setting of a time limit and widening of the fighting area into twice the size required of the original arena, and the wearing of armor for safety reasons as it is played full contact and bare-chested with no armour or groinguard in the original province, as the Filipino martial artists from more modest areas generally had no such access to Western accessories.

==Global Expansion==
Sikaran began growing globally after the participation in International Martial Arts tournaments in the middle to late 1960s, as a result of which four senior practitioners, including Martial Law era activist hero Nestor Principe, were recruited to teach the art in Malaysia.

Over the last several decades Sikaran has spread across the globe where Filipino practitioners have established schools. Global locations include America, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Canada.

The most well known organisations include but are not limited to the World Sikaran Arnis Brotherhood, Global Sikaran Federation.

The World Sikaran Arnis Brotherhood was founded by Melton C. Geronimo who was a former Lt. COL of the Philippine Air Force and Mayor of Baras. He received his Grand Master ship from the Asian Karate Association (composed of Japan, Korea, China and the Philippines) in 1966. He is often credited for modernising the curriculum to include the karate inspired belting systems and forms.

Hari Osias Banaag is the founder of the Global Sikaran Federation and is a diplomat for the Traditional game. Hari Osias Bannag is known for his expansion of the style globally and efforts to differentiate it from other martial art styles. He recently attended and was warmly received at the UNESCO Collective Consultation Meeting on the Preservation and the Promotion of Traditional Sports and Game (TSG) and is an appointed member of Ad hoc Advisory Committee Traditional Sports and Games, UNESCO(TSG)Ref

Sikaran and its hybrid styles (Sikaran Kickboxing and the Australian variant Saboong Kickboxing) should not be confused with Kali-Sikaran which is a modern Filipino Martial art, that is not related to the style originating from Rizal. Kali-Sikaran is more closely related to the other weapons based variants of Filipino Martial Arts.

Whilst Sikaran participants have shown good results in Tae Kwon Do, Sikaran and kickboxing competitions in the past, in recent years some practitioners have ventured into MMA and have mixed the style with other martial arts and is an exciting evolution of the sport.

<text>The Viljandi Folk Music Festival is a music festival in Estonia with a central focus on European folk music. It is traditionally held during the last weekend of July, when the otherwise quiet city of Viljandi is completely transformed as the small city center is suddenly flooded with people. The main attraction of the festival is the friendly atmosphere. Over 25,000 people attend the concerts every year, but many more just come to take part in the festivities. As such, it is the largest annual music festival in Estonia, and one of the largest folk music festivals in Europe.

<text>Yding Skovhøj in Horsens municipality, Jutland is one of Denmark&#x27;s highest points. 

==Features==
Its height is above sea level when the height of one of the Bronze Age burial mounds built on the top of the hill is included. If these man-made structures are ignored the hill&#x27;s highest point is at , which is lower than Denmark&#x27;s highest natural point, Møllehøj at . Ejer Bavnehøj is Denmark&#x27;s third highest natural point at .

Yding Forest covers the hill. Within the forest there are three Bronze Age burial mounds. &quot;Høj&quot;, from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot;, can be translated to mean hill or mound. The highest point is the central mound. The eastern burial mound is high and the western one is high.

==History==
Ejer Bavnehøj had been measured as the highest point in Denmark in the mid-nineteenth century but in 1941 new measurements established that the top of one of Yding Skovhøj&#x27;s burial mounds was higher. This started a heated discussion about whether man-made structures could be counted as part of Denmark&#x27;s highest point which finished with Professor N.E. Nørlund defining the highest point as being the highest natural point, without including the height of man-made piles of earth. As Ejer Bavnehøj was higher than the highest natural point of Yding Skovhøj it was then regarded as being Denmark&#x27;s highest point until February 2005 when researchers discovered that in reality Møllehøj was slightly taller.

<text>Elka Graham (born 20 October 1981), now known by her married name Elka Whalan, is an Australian former competition swimmer who swam in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2004 Athens Olympics. Graham specialised in the 200-metre and 400-metre freestyle events, also swimming the 800-metre freestyle. She represented Australia at numerous international meets, including the Pan Pacific Championships, World Swimming Championships in 2001 and 2003, and the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

She was a member of Australia&#x27;s 4×200-metre freestyle relay team that finished first at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, only to be disqualified when she and the rest of the relay team jumped into the pool to celebrate before all the other teams in the final had finished.

In 2007, she claimed that she was offered performance-enhancing drugs from another member of the Australian swimming team before the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, but refused to name the person.

Graham retired from swimming in May 2006 and is now involved in the media, modelling and corporate speaking. She is married to athlete Thomas Whalan and has four kids.

<text>Kamilaroi Highway is a state highway located in the north-western region of New South Wales, Australia, and links via and to . The highway is named after the Kamilaroi Indigenous Australian people who live in the area.

==Route==
The highway begins at the intersection with Mitchell Highway at Bourke, and heads in an easterly direction through Brewarrina and Walgett to meet Newell Highway in northern Narrabri. It recommences from the intersection with Newell Highway in southern Narrabri and continues in a south-easterly direction via Gunnedah and Quirindi to eventually terminate at the intersection with New England Highway just north of Willow Tree.

Approximately north of Boggabri is a spectacular landmark called Gin&#x27;s Leap, known in the days of Cobb and Co as &quot;The Rock&quot;. It is said that a young Aboriginal girl, being pursued by white settlers on horseback, jumped to her death rather than be raped and shot like others in her family.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB, later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 68 was declared from Bourke via Brewarrina to Walgett (and continuing northwards via Collarenabri and Mogil Mogil to the state border with Queensland, and westwards via Louth, Wilcannia, Menindee and Pooncarrie to Wentworth), Main Road No. 126 was declared from Quirindi via Gunnedah and Boggabri to Narrabri (and continuing northwards via Bellata and Moree to Boggabilla), and Main Road No. 127 was declared from Narrabri to Wee Waa (and continuing west via Pilliga to Walgett) on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to Trunk Road 68 and Main Roads 126 and 127 on 8 April 1929. 

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, later declared Trunk Road 72 from Narrabri via Boggabri to the intersection with State Highway 11 (Oxley Highway) in Gunnedah (and continuing north via Bellata to Moree) on 18 July 1933; the northern end of Main Road 126 was truncated to meet State Highway 11 at Gunnedah, but these declarations were altered only 3 months later, when the southern end of Trunk Road 72 was extended to terminate at the intersection with State Highway 9 (New England Highway) just north of Willow Tree, subsuming Main Road 126, on 17 October 1933; Main Road 126 was re-declared from the intersection with Trunk Road 72 in Quirindi to the intersection with State Highway 9 at Wallabadah. Main Road 343 was declared on 26 September 1933 between Wee Waa and Burren Junction. Trunk Road 72 was permanently truncated at Narrabri when State Highway 17 (later Newell Highway) was declared on 16 March 1938. Main Road 619 was declared on 16 August 1978 between Burren Junction and Walgett.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Kamilaroi Highway was declared as State Highway 29 on 12 February 1999, from the intersection with New England Highway at Willow Tree to the intersection with Oxley Highway at Gunnedah, then from Gunnedah via Boggabri to the intersection with Newell Highway at Narrabri, then from Narrabri via Wee Waa to the intersection of Castlereagh Highway northeast of Walgett, then from Walgett via Brewarrina to the intersection with Mitchell Highway in Bourke, subsuming Trunk Road 72 and Main Roads 343 and 619; the eastern end of Trunk Road 68 was truncated to meet Mitchell Highway at Bourke, and the northern end of Main Road 127 was truncated to meet Kamilaroi Highway at Wee Waa. The highway today, as Highway 29, still retains this declaration.

Kamilaroi Highway was signed National Route 37 in 1974, between Willow Tree and Narrabri - later extended west to Bourke when the highway was declared in 1999 - but poorly signed west of Walgett. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B51 between Willow Tree and Narrabri, unallocated between Narrabri and Walgett, and route B76 between Walgett and Bourke.

===Brewarrina Bridge===
The wrought-iron Brewarrina Bridge over the Barwon River was officially opened on 7 December 1888. The main span is 16.8 metres in length and there are four approach spans on each side, all approximately 9 metres in length. The overall length is 91 metres and the bridge has a single lane 4.5 metres wide. The roadway is carried on cross-girders covered with timber deck. It is the second oldest lift bridge in New South Wales, and has been assessed as being of State significance. The bridge was damaged in 2000 and is now closed to vehicular traffic, and used as a pedestrian bridge only.

<text>Reidgotaland, Reidgothland, Reidgotland, Hreidgotaland or Hreiðgotaland was a land mentioned in Germanic heroic legend (mentioned in the Scandinavian sagas as well as the Anglo-Saxon Widsith) usually interpreted as the land of the Goths. 

==Etymology and Location==
Oddly, &quot;hreiðr&quot; can mean &quot;bird&#x27;s nest&quot; and perhaps it was a kenning for the Goths tradition of moving and &quot;nesting&quot; in new territories, but &quot;hreið-&quot; is also a name-prefix meaning &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;eager&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, &quot;famous&quot;, &quot;noble&quot;. Another possibility is that it was originally &quot;reið&quot; &quot;ride, journey&quot; (see Raidô). The use of the prefix is simple as the same tribal name was used for the Gutes of Gotland. The identification of the territory varies between the sources. This is the list of meanings given by Nordisk familjebok:

# The Island of Gotland.
# Götaland.
# The land of the Goths, i.e. Gothiscandza and their later territories. In Hervarar saga, it was the same as Oium and bordered the land of the Huns from which it was separated by Myrkviðr.
# The territories of the Goths in southern Europe, according to Anglo-Saxon sources.
# Denmark and Sweden (according to Snorri&#x27;s Edda it was the earthly kingdom of Odin).
# Denmark.
# Jutland.

The second edition of Nordisk familjebok explains that Hreidgoths was originally applied to the Ostrogoths in south-eastern Europe. It appears as hraiþkutum &quot;hręiðgotum&quot; on the Rök Stone in Östergötland. In Hervarar saga, the name &quot;Hreiðgotaland&quot; is applied to the territories of the Ostrogoths in south-eastern Europe. In Widsith, the traveller has been with the &quot;Hreðgotum&quot;, ruled by Eormanrīc, historic king of the Goths. In Snorri&#x27;s Edda, it is either applied to Jutland or to Scandinavia as a whole, while the islands are called &quot;Eygotaland&quot;. In the Legendary sagas however, Eygotaland is used only for the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea.

<doc id="937238" wikidata="Q3160900" url="?curid=937238" title="James Allen (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Sir James Allen (10 February 1855 – 28 July 1942) was a prominent New Zealand politician and diplomat. He held a number of the most important political offices in the country, including Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was also New Zealand&#x27;s Minister of Defence during World War I.

==Early life==
Allen was born in Adelaide, Australia. After his mother&#x27;s early death, his father took him to Dunedin, New Zealand, where the family resided for several years. In either 1861 or 1862, however, Allen and his brother were given into the care of an uncle in Somerset, England. Shortly afterwards, Allen&#x27;s father also died, leaving him an orphan.

Despite this rather turbulent beginning to his life, Allen made a good start. After first attending Clifton College in Bristol (having won a scholarship to do so), he gained admittance to St John&#x27;s College at Cambridge University. He graduated with a BA in 1877. Shortly afterwards, Allen decided to return to Dunedin, where he had inherited a significant amount of property from his father.

In Dunedin, Allen was highly successful, serving on the City Council and even playing for the Otago provincial rugby team. He left for England once again in 1883, studying at the Royal School of Mines for several years. When he returned to Dunedin, he established a presence in Otago&#x27;s coal and gold mining industries.

==Early parliamentary career==





In 1887, Allen decided to enter national politics, standing in the Dunedin East seat as a conservative opponent to Robert Stout, the Premier. Few expected a first-time challenger to defeat the Premier, but amazingly, Allen did just that. Allen&#x27;s own tenure as MP for Dunedin East was short, however, as he was himself voted out of office at the next (1890) election. In 1892, however, Allen returned to Parliament after winning a by-election in the rural Otago electorate of Bruce, which he held until he retired in 1920.

Gradually, Allen developed a reputation as a solid performer in Parliament. He lacked the skills at oratory of some of his contemporaries, and was often seen as humourless and uncharismatic. But he was nevertheless considered dependable, reasonable, and practical. He was sometimes cited as a possible leader for Parliament&#x27;s conservative faction, but when the conservatives eventually came together to found the Reform Party, the more charismatic William Massey became leader instead.

==Ministerial career==
When Reform won the 1911 election, Massey became Prime Minister and Allen was elevated to Cabinet. His primary responsibilities were finance, education, and defence in the Reform Government, and he was very active in all three portfolios. As Minister of Finance, he attempted (with only a limited degree of success) to curtail the spending of the outgoing Premier, Joseph Ward, believing strongly in the need to reduce New Zealand&#x27;s overseas borrowing. As Minister of Education, he was responsible for legislation that guaranteed statutory funding for universities. As Minister of Defence, he encouraged New Zealand&#x27;s development of naval and air capabilities independent of the United Kingdom, and worked to improve the quality of compulsory military training. He also reversed the previous government&#x27;s policy of opposing close defence co-operation with Australia.
In World War I, Allen was a major figure in New Zealand&#x27;s war effort, playing a very significant organisational role. His reforms of the military training programme were widely credited with allowing a rapid deployment of New Zealand forces, including the forces which invaded and occupied Samoa (then a territory of Germany). In August 1915, a war-time coalition government was formed, and Allen lost his finance and education roles to members of the erstwhile Opposition, but he continued to play a significant role. Towards the end of the war, when both Massey (the Prime Minister) and Ward (the Leader of the Opposition) travelled overseas for meetings and conferences, Allen was Acting Prime Minister - in total, he spent nearly two years in this role. The stress of his many responsibilities during the war was considerable, and was only worsened when his son was killed in the ill-fated landing at Gallipoli. Allen was appointed an Officer of the Legion of Honour in February 1922 when he was High Commissioner in London.

==Subsequent activities==
After the war, the coalition government collapsed, and James Allen once again became Minister of Finance. In October 1919, he was made the first Minister of External Affairs, a new ministerial portfolio that was created to administer New Zealand&#x27;s newly acquired League of Nations Mandate Samoa. He took up these posts reluctantly, describing himself as weary of politics. In 1920, he resigned from Parliament to take up a position as New Zealand&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. He also represented New Zealand at the League of Nations, taking a prominent part in the League&#x27;s Permanent Mandates Commission.

After returning to New Zealand, Allen became active in a number of organisations. Reflecting his long-held interest in the Pacific Islands, which had been stimulated by a number of visits in the course of his political career, he was a prominent member of the Institute of Pacific Relations, whose New Zealand branch he chaired from its formation in 1926 until late 1937. He was active in All Saints&#x27; Church, Dunedin and also vice-president of the Bible-in-Schools League, reflecting a cause which he had controversially championed while Minister of Education.

On 1 June 1927, Allen was appointed to the Legislative Council, the (now-abolished) upper house of Parliament. The Legislative Council was considerably more sedate than the lower house, and Allen was not overly stressed by its activities. At the end of his first term in 1934, he was reappointed (until 1941).

Allen retired from public life in 1938, and died in Dunedin on 28 July 1942.

==Honours and awards==
Allen was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1917 New Year Honours, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1926 New Year Honours. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935.

<doc id="937243" wikidata="Q985135" url="?curid=937243" title="Giddha">
<text>Giddha () is a popular folk dance of women in the Punjab region. The dance is often considered derived from the ancient dance known as the ring dance and is just as energetic as bhangra; at the same time it manages to creatively display feminine grace, elegance and flexibility. It is a highly colourful dance form which has spread to all regions of India. Women perform this dance mainly at festive or social occasions. The dance is accompanied by rhythmic clapping, with a typical traditional folk song performed by elder women in the background.

Giddha varies from other forms of traditional Punjabi dance in that it does not require the two-headed barrel &quot;dhol&quot; drum to be performed. Instead, women stand in a circle formation and clap rhythms. A lead woman will recite a &quot;boli&quot; (lyrics) with a refrain that the entire circle then repeats. The whole form of a giddha song is worked through in this call and response form. Giddha details stories of women&#x27;s lives, including sexuality.

==History==

Giddha is said to be originated from the ancient ring dance which was dominant in Punjab. Giddha displays a traditional mode of performing Punjabi femininity, as seen through dress, choreography, . Since the Partition of India in 1947 and the division of Punjab into West Punjab (Pakistan) and East Punjab (India), folk dances of Punjab on both sides of the border have been consolidated, staged, and promoted as iconic expressions of Punjabi culture. While the form of giddha was not seriously affected by Partition, Gibb Schreffler writes that it has been classified as the women&#x27;s dance counterpart to the male form bhangra, despite that not entirely being the case.

As Punjabi dance forms became codified in the 1960s-onward, bhangra and giddha competitions have become popular throughout Punjab and the Punjabi diaspora. Punjabi dance forms have also spread through collegiate-level dance troupes in Punjab since the 1960s and in South Asian student groups in the US, UK, and Canada since the 1990s.

==Dress code==
Traditionally, women used to wear salwar kameez and Ghagra in bright colours and jewellery. The attire is completed by dressing the hair in two braids and folk ornaments and wearing a tikka on the forehead.

<doc id="937244" wikidata="Q116201" url="?curid=937244" title="Georges-Louis Le Sage">
<text>Georges-Louis Le Sage (; 13 June 1724 – 20 November 1803) was a Genevan physicist and is most known for his theory of gravitation, for his invention of an electric telegraph and his anticipation of the kinetic theory of gases. He was a contributor to Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

== Life and education ==
Le Sage was born in Geneva, his father, a descendant of Théodore Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné, was Georges-Louis Le Sage from Couches in Burgundy, and his mother Anne Marie Camp. His father, who was the author of many papers on various subjects, occupied his son of his own studies early, including the works of the Roman poet Lucretius at the age of 13. According to Pierre Prévost and some notices of Le Sage, the education by his parents in his early years was very strict, and Le Sage reacted to this by isolating himself and with meditation on various subjects. Contrary to his father, who allegedly only accepted facts and had little interest in generalisation, Le Sage was primarily interested in general and abstract principles.

Le Sage took the first regular education at the college of Geneva, where he was friendly connected with Jean-André Deluc. Besides philosophy, he studied mathematics under Gabriel Cramer, and physics under Jean-Louis Calandrini. Later he decided to study medicine in Basel, where he also gave private lessons in mathematics. Here, Le Sage also met Daniel Bernoulli, whose work on the kinetic nature of gases was very influential to him. Then Le Sage left Basel and continued to study medicine in Paris. After he came back to Geneva, Le Sage tried to work as a physician, but it was denied because his father was a native from France. There, he was friendly connected with Charles Bonnet.

Against the will of his father Le Sage devoted his life to mathematics and, in particular, a search for the mechanisms of gravity. He tried to become a professor for mathematics in Geneva, but he couldn&#x27;t get the position.

Although Le Sage published few papers in his life, he had extensive letter exchanges with people like Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Paolo Frisi, Roger Joseph Boscovich, Johann Heinrich Lambert, Pierre Simon Laplace, Daniel Bernoulli, Firmin Abauzit, Lord Stanhope etc..

He gave private lessons in mathematics, and his pupils, including La Rochefoucauld, Simon Lhuilier, Pierre Prévost, were deeply impressed by his personality. He was a correspondent of the Paris Academy of Science and also became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Le Sage died at the age of 79 in Geneva.

== Character and health ==
Le Sage described his manner of thinking and working by saying:

I have been born with four dispositions well adapted for making progress in science, but with two great defects in the faculties necessary for that purpose. 1. An ardent desire to know the truth; 2. Great activity of mind; 3. An uncommon (justesse) soundness of understanding; 4. A strong desire for precision and distinctness of ideas; 5. An excessive weakness of memory; 6. A great incapacity of continued attention.

Le Sage also suffered from insomnia, and as a result of this he often was unable to work for days. Additionally, in 1762 he had an accident which left him nearly blind.

To compensate the weakness of his memory, he wrote his thoughts on playing cards – over 35000 cards are still lying in the library of Geneva. As a consequence of his mental disposition, many of his papers remained unfinished and unpublished. For example: his main work on Gravitation; a history of theories of gravitation; a treatise on final causes; a biographical note on Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. However, some of them were posthumously published by his pupil Pierre Prévost.

== Telegraph ==
In 1774 he realised an early electric telegraph. The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the alphabet and its range was only between two rooms of his home.

== Kinetic Theory ==
Le Sage also tried to explain the nature of gases. This attempt was appreciated by Rudolf Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell wrote: &quot;His theory of impact is faulty, but his explanation of the expansive force of gases&quot; [i.e., pressure] &quot;is essentially the same as in the dynamical theory, as it now stands.&quot;
Le Sage also clearly pointed out, that he was not the first one who described such a mechanism, and referred to Lucretius, Gassendi, Hermann and Bernoulli.

== Gravitation ==

=== History ===
In his early youth Le Sage was strongly influenced by the writings of the Roman poet Lucretius and incorporated some of Lucretius&#x27; ideas into a mechanical explanation of gravitation, which he subsequently worked on and defended throughout his life. Le Sage wrote in one of his cards, that he developed the basic features of the theory, which was later called Le Sage&#x27;s theory of gravitation, already in 1743. Then on 15 January 1747 Le Sage wrote to his father:

Eureka, Eureka. Never have I had so much satisfaction as at this moment, when I have just explained rigorously, by the simple law of rectilinear motion, those of universal gravitation, which decreases in the same proportion as the squares of the distance increase.

The first exposition of his theory, &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;origine des forces mortes&quot;, was created by him in 1748, but was never published. In 1756 one of Le Sage&#x27;s expositions of the theory was published, and in 1758 he sent a more detailed exposition of the theory to another competition of the Academy of Sciences. In this paper, entitled &quot;Essai de Chymie Méchanique&quot;, he tried to explain both the nature of gravitation and chemical affinities. He shared the prize with one other entrant, but his theory of cohesion never gained acceptance, and only the gravitational portion of the theory was found to be of interest by a few of his contemporaries, including Euler. The exposition of the theory which became accessible to a broader public was &quot;Lucrèce Newtonien&quot; (&quot;The Newtonian Lucretius&quot;), in which the correspondence with Lucretius&#x27; concepts was fully developed. Another exposition of the theory was published from Le Sage&#x27;s notes posthumously by Prévost in 1818, and was called &quot;Physique Mécanique de George Louis Le Sage&quot;, but it does not contain anything which was not published in the earlier papers.

=== Le Sage&#x27;s predecessors ===
Le Sage was not the first to propose what is now called &quot;Le Sage&#x27;s theory of gravity&quot;. Those who had described the theory previously include Fatio, Cramer, and Redeker. The extent to which Le Sage was influenced by these predecessors is a matter of controversy.

==== Fatio ====
The theory now called &quot;Le Sage&#x27;s theory of gravity&quot; was originally proposed in the 1690s by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a friend of Sir Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens. Fatio was a well-known Swiss personage, and the kinetic theory of gravitation was his most notable scientific contribution, to which he devoted much of his life. Le Sage said that he heard of Fatio for the first time through his father, because his father had heard the prophecies of the cevénots (camisards), and told him that Fatio was among those prophets. Le Sage&#x27;s father was well acquainted with the scientific fields in which Fatio worked, and he tutored Le Sage in the sciences. Nevertheless, Le Sage later claimed that his father never told him that Fatio had created a theory of gravitation essentially identical to his own. (Le Sage also admitted that he had a pathologically bad memory, so it is unclear if his recollection is accurate.) In any case, Le Sage stated that he knew nothing of Fatio&#x27;s theory until he was informed by his teacher Gabriel Cramer in 1749.

A few years after Fatio&#x27;s death (which occurred in 1753), Le Sage began trying to acquire Fatio&#x27;s papers to – according to his own words – rescue them from oblivion, and also for a treatise he planned to write on the history of theories of gravitation. One of Fatio&#x27;s papers was sent to Le Sage by Abauzit in 1758, and other papers were acquired by Le Sage in 1766, 1770 and 1785. He also started a biographical note on Fatio, although he did not complete it, and he tried without success to publish some of Fatio&#x27;s papers. The Geneva manuscripts were deposited in the library of Geneva by Prévost after Le Sage&#x27;s death and are still there.

Le Sage wrote to Lambert in 1768: &quot;Nicolas Fatio de Duillier had created a theory in 1689, which is so similar to mine, that it only differed in the elasticity, which he has given his intensely agitated matter&quot;. There he outlined the great similarity of the theories, but incorrectly claimed that Fatio assumed elastic collisions, even though the loss of speed of the gravitational corpuscles was explicitly stressed by Fatio as a crucial element of his theory. Le Sage sent in a letter to Boscovich the beginning of Fatio&#x27;s Latin poem (modeled on Lucretius) on the subject of his theory of gravitation, and told him that he wanted to publish it, but Boscovich did not agree, arguing that it would be too hard for most people to understand if it is published in Latin.

Le Sage was worried about the possibility that people might think he had gotten the idea for the gravitation theory from Fatio, because he went to the trouble of making a &quot;certificate&quot;, and having it signed by the mathematician Pfleiderer and the astronomer Mallet (two friends of Le Sage), stating that, except for a copy made by Abauzit in 1758, Le Sage saw no papers of Fatio before 1766, and in these papers there was nothing which was not developed by Le Sage in a more detailed way.

In the &quot;Physique Mécanique&quot; published by Prevost after Le Sage&#x27;s death, Fatio is mentioned in connection with the net structure of matter, but it goes on to claim that he (Le Sage) had developed the idea of the net structure already in 1763, before he was in possession of Fatio&#x27;s original papers. However, according to Zehe&#x27;s description of the Abauzit manuscript from 1758, this paper contains Fatio&#x27;s description of the net structure of matter. In the same paper, Le Sage repeated the incorrect claim that Fatio assumed &quot;elastic&quot; collisions – and therefore did not really provide a valid explanation of gravity. Zehe attempted to account for Le Sage&#x27;s puzzling claims that Fatio assumed &quot;elastic&quot; collisions by speculating that Le Sage must not have studied Fatio&#x27;s papers very closely.

In general, Le Sage and Prévost claimed that Le Sage&#x27;s theory was superior to that of Fatio, but a more recent and detailed analysis of Fatio&#x27;s paper by Zehe shows that it is Fatio&#x27;s theory which is more developed.

==== Gabriel Cramer, Franz Albert Redeker ====
According to Le Sage, after creating his first essay on gravitation, he was informed in 1748 by Firmin Abauzit about a very similar theory of Gabriel Cramer, who happens to have been Le Sage&#x27;s teacher in Geneva. In later years Le Sage responded in two different ways to charges that his ideas on gravitation were only the result of studying Cramer&#x27;s papers. First, he argued that his first essay was written before he knew of the theories of his predecessors. Second, he argued that even if he knew about Cramer&#x27;s theory, it makes no difference, because Cramer&#x27;s theory is too vague and scientifically not valuable. Le Sage did, however, accuse Cramer of plagiarising Fatio&#x27;s theory. (Fatio himself had made the same accusation.)

In 1751 Le Sage also became aware of Franz Albert Redeker&#x27;s theory. Le Sage began to write a history of theories of gravitation, in which he intended to describe the theories of Fatio and Redeker, but he never finished it.

==== Summary ====
Although Le Sage acknowledged that he was not the first one to propose such a theory, he always said that he was the first one who ever drew all consequences from the theory, even after coming into possession of Cramer&#x27;s, Fatio&#x27;s and Redeker&#x27;s papers. For example, in his &quot;Lucrece Newtonien&quot; (1782) Le Sage did not mention any of his predecessors by name. He merely stated that it was &quot;likely&quot; such a simple idea had occurred to others previously, but if so, they had &quot;presented it in a vague and ill-assured fashion&quot;. He went on to ask rhetorically why none of these supposed predecessors (of whom he professes to have no definite knowledge) &quot;pushed these consequences to their conclusion and communicated their research&quot;. He suggested that the answer was that they had no clear view of the subject, had not firmly grasped the principles of the theory, had allowed themselves to be seduced by specious sophisms, had bowed to the authority of great names, or had &quot;lacked sufficient love of truth or courage of their convictions to abandon easy pleasures and exterior advantages in order to devote themselves to researches at the time difficult and little welcome.&quot;.

Prévost praised his friend Le Sage for &quot;scrupulously giving credit to his predecessors in all of his writings&quot;. However, although he sometimes referred to those predecessors, he often spoke in a derogatory way about them – see his comments in &quot;Lucrece Newtonien&quot;, and his appraisal of Cramer as too vague and scientifically not valuable. Lord Kelvin and Aronson repeated Prevost&#x27;s praise, based only on Prevost&#x27;s account.

<text>Prof Bernhard Studer HFRSE (August 21, 1794May 2, 1887), was a 19th-century Swiss geologist.

==Biography==

He was born at Buren an der Aare near Bern in Switzerland on 21 August 1794.

He was educated to become a clergyman, but his interests later switched to sciences. In 1815 he became a teacher of mathematics at the gymnasium in Bern, and during the following year, began studying geology at University of Göttingen as a pupil of Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann. He subsequently furthered his education at Freiburg, Berlin and Paris.

In 1825 he published his first major work, &quot;Beyträge zu einer Monographie der Molasse&quot;. Later on, he commenced his detailed investigations of the western Alps, and published in 1834 his &quot;Geologie der westlichen Schweizer-Alpen&quot;. In the same year, largely through his influence, the University of Bern was established and he became the first professor of geology. His &quot;Geologie der Schweiz&quot; in two volumes (1851–1853), and his geological maps of Switzerland, prepared with the assistance of Arnold Escher von der Linth, are high points of his research. In 1850 he was elected a Foreign Member of the Geological Society of London.

In 1859 he organized the geological survey of Switzerland, being appointed president of the commission, and retaining this position until the end of his life. It was remarked by Jules Marcou that Studer was present at the first meeting of the &quot;Société helvétique des sciences naturelles&quot; at Geneva on October 6, 1815, and remained a member during 72 years. In 1864, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London, in 1879. In 1882, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>Veerle Casteleyn (born 6 March 1978, in Vlaanderen, Belgium) is a Belgian musical theatre performer and ballerina.

==Biography==
Casteleyn trained at the De Koninklijke Balletschool van Antwerpen in Belgium, and during her training, she was in various plays such as:

*&quot;Joint Venture&quot;
*&quot;Initiate&quot;
*&quot;Fanfare&quot;
*&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (short piece)
*&quot;Self Made&quot;

After leaving school, she performed in various shows in Belgium such as:

*&quot;Annie&quot;
*&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;
*&quot;Cats&quot;
*The Sound of Music (revival)

In 1997, Casteleyn moved to London to play the role of Jemima in the 1998 video production of &quot;Cats&quot;. After the video, she took on several roles as part of the swing in the West End&#x27;s production of &quot;Cats&quot;. Soon after, she started to perform as Jemima on a regular basis; she also understudied the roles of Victoria and Rumpleteazer. After &quot;Cats&quot;, she joined the UK tour of &quot;Carousel&quot; as Louise. After the tour was over, Casteleyn went back to her homeland of Belgium and performed as Fredrika in the European tour of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;.

In 2002, Casteleyn landed the role of Julia in the Belgian production of the French hit, &quot;Roméo et Juliette: de la Haine à l’Amour&quot; (appropriately renamed &quot;Romeo en Julia: van Haat tot Liefde&quot;). It was her first lead role and her first time releasing a CD with her voice on it.

After &quot;Romeo en Julia&quot;, Casteleyn starred as Chava in the Straight From the Heart production of Fiddler on the Roof. After a short hiatus, she moved on to television, becoming a cast member on the Belgian TV show &quot;De Wet volgens Milo&quot; as Sonja, an intern at a law firm. At the end of 2005, she took part in the Belgian version of the Czech musical &quot;Dracula&quot;, as a part of the ensemble.

In 2006, Casteleyn was a part of the ensemble in the Antwerp production of the ABBA song-inspired musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;. On 9 August, she began rehearsals for the new Dutch production of &quot;Cats&quot;, in which she was a swing member (1st cover for Electra, 1st cover for Sylvani aka Jemima, and 2nd cover for Victoria). She took over the role of Jemima full-time in the summer of 2007. &quot;Cats&quot; premiered in Rotterdam in October, and toured the Netherlands until October 2007.

In 2010, she was part of the ensemble in the Belgian production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;.

After &quot;Oliver!&quot; she started rehearsals for the Musical Droomvlucht, which had World-Premiere on the 09.10.2011. She currently works as a dance teacher in Sint-Niklaas.

<text>Ilfov () is the county that surrounds Bucharest, the capital of Romania. It used to be largely rural, but, after the fall of Communism, many of the county&#x27;s villages and communes developed into high-income commuter towns, which act like suburbs or satellites of Bucharest. The gentrification of the county is continuing, with many towns in Ilfov, such as Otopeni, having some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the country.

The county has experienced rapid demographic growth in the 21st century, being the fastest growing Romanian county between 2011 and 2021.

==History==
Most of today&#x27;s Ilfov County used to be covered by Codrii Vlăsiei, a thick forest, but there were several Dacian settlements, most important being Argedava, on the right bank of the Argeș River in what is now Popești, which was the capital of king Burebista.

The thick forests were useful for retreat during the migration age because they were not easy to cross on horseback. In fact, the name of the forest means &quot;the Forests of the Vlachs&quot; (Romanians), a name given by the Slavs who inhabited the nearby plains.

The county was named after the Ilfov River and it appears for the first time in a 1482 donation act of voivode Vlad Călugărul to the monastery of Snagov. In earliest documents, it was known as &quot;Elhov&quot;. The name is of Slavic origin (&quot;&quot;, alder; &quot;&quot;, possessive suffix), referring to a river which flowed through an alder forest.

==Administrative divisions==


The county has 8 towns and 32 communes. The largest settlements by population are Popești-Leordeni, Voluntari, Chiajna, Bragadiru, Pantelimon, Buftea, Otopeni. These are the only settlements with more than 20.000 residents. Unlike most other areas of Romania, the population in Ilfov County is increasing, as many of the settlements here are seen as suburbs of Bucharest and are increasingly attracting upper-class families. At the 2022 census, 45.19% of the county&#x27;s population was defined as urban.

Popești-Leordeni is the largest settlement in Ilfov county, with a population of 53,431 at the 2021 census (representing an increase of 31,536 people since 2011, this being the largest population increase of any settlement in Romania between 2011 and 2021).

Voluntari is the second largest settlement, with a population of 47,366 at the 2021 census. It has experienced rapid population growth in recent years. There were serious debates about the city level awarded to Voluntari in 2004, as it is alleged that it was given in regard to the city&#x27;s political affiliation, rather than population, development or any other objective features. Despite this, Voluntari did have a population of 30,000 at that time, and many other localities with this population have been given city-status in the past.

Chiajna is the third largest settlement in Ilfov county, and one of the fastest growing localities in Romania, with its population having increased from 29,329 people in 2011 to 43,588
people in 2022, according to the Romanian population census.

Buftea is associated with the cinema of Romania; as the film studios MediaPro Pictures are located in Buftea.

Otopeni was transformed into a town under the communist regime, as part of Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s systematization policy, with semidetached houses being replaced by four-storey blocks of flats.

Before 1972, Ilfov County used to be one of the largest counties of Romania, but parts of it were added to neighbouring counties and nowadays it is the smallest (excluding the city of Bucharest, which has a special status). Between 1981 and 1997, it was called &quot;Sectorul Agricol Ilfov&quot; and it was not a separate county, but subordinate to the capital.

Ilfov County is the only county that has its capital outside of its territorial area, in Bucharest, which is not part of the actual county. Initially, right after the 1968 reform of the public administration in communist Romania, Ilfov was a larger county, that comprised its present-day territory, the entire Giurgiu County, Bucharest and the western parts of Călărași and Ialomița counties. Later during the communist period, its territory was reduced to its current size and it became one of the sectors of Bucharest. It became again a county in 1997, when its capital was designated to be Bucharest.
However, in 2005, some plans were proposed that would merge Bucharest with 90 other communes located to up to 40 km outside the city, in Ilfov County and other nearby counties into a &quot;metropolitan area&quot; of Bucharest, similar to Greater London. As of 2011, these plans did not happen, while a debate on the general administrative division of Romania was under way.

==Historical county==

Historically, the county was located in the southern part of Greater Romania, in the southern part of the historical region of Muntenia, around and in the south of Bucharest. During the interwar years, the county, which contained the city of Bucharest, was the most populous county in Romania. Currently the territory of the county is divided among Bucharest, the current Ilfov County, Dâmbovița County, Ialomița County, Călărași County, and Giurgiu County. It was bordered to the north by the counties of Prahova and Dâmboviţa, to the west by Vlașca County, to the east by Ialomița County, and to the south by Durostor County.

===Administration===

The county included the cities of Bucharest and Oltenița, and originally seven administrative districts (&quot;plăși&quot;):

#Plasa Băneasa, headquartered at Băneasa (with 39 villages)
#Plasa Bolintin, headquartered at Bolintin (with 38 villages)
#Plasa Budești, headquartered at Budești (with 31 villages)
#Plasa Fierbinți, headquartered at Fierbinți (with 51 villages)
#Plasa Oltenița, headquartered at Oltenița (with 25 villages)
#Plasa Sărulești, headquartered at Sărulești (with 54 villages)
#Plasa Vidra, headquartered at Vidra (with 28 villages)

Subsequently, the county established three more districts:

<text>Arnold Escher von der Linth (8 June 1807 in Zürich12 July 1872) was a Swiss geologist, the son of Hans Conrad Escher von der Linth (1767–1823).

He made the first ascent of the Lauteraarhorn on 8 August 1842 together with Pierre Jean Édouard Desor and Christian Girard, and guides Melchior Bannholzer and Jakob Leuthold.

He studied geology and other sciences in Geneva, where one of his teachers was Nicolas Theodore de Saussure, and in Berlin as a student of Leopold von Buch and Alexander von Humboldt. In 1856 he became professor of geology at the &quot;École Polytechnique&quot; in Zürich and established the Geological Institute there. His researches led him to be regarded as one of the founders of Swiss geology.

With Bernhard Studer, he was the first to systematically explore the geology of the Swiss Alps and its neighboring regions (eastern Switzerland, Vorarlberg, Tyrol, Piedmont and Lombardy). Also with Studer, he produced a highly acclaimed geological map of Switzerland (1853).

In particular, his scientific liaison with the Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison (1792–1871) made him a contributor to the discovery of the Silurian system, and the first systematic description of sedimentary rocks and their index fossils.

He was the author of &quot;Geologische Bemerkungen über das nordliche Vorarlberg und einige angrenzenden Gegenden&quot; (Geological observations on the northern Vorarlberg and some adjacent areas), published at Zürich in 1853.

<text>The Seine River is a river in Kenora, Rainy River and Thunder Bay Districts in northwestern Ontario, Canada. It flows from Lac des Mille Lacs to Rainy Lake.

The river was an important route in the days of the fur trade. Gold was discovered along the river near the end of the 19th century and several mining operations established in the area. In 1943, a section of the river was diverted near Steep Rock Lake to gain access to a large iron ore deposit under the lake. That mine has since been closed. The river is used for recreational canoeing and kayaking.

==Course==

===Upper reaches===
The river flows west out of the northwest arm of Lac des Mille Lacs in Thunder Bay District over the Lac des Mille Lacs Dam, owned by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) and operated by the Valerie Falls Limited Partnership (Brookfield Renewable Power) (See Lac des Mille Lacs Dam). It flows through Mosher lake, takes in the left tributary Firesteel River and briefly flows through the southeast corner of Kenora District. The river turns southwest into Rainy River District, heads over the Long Rapids and Camp Six Rapids, takes in the left tributary Mercutio River, tumbles over the Islands Falls, reaches Bradshaw Lake and flows into the Marmion Lake and reservoir, where it takes in four right tributaries.

According to Barnes, the Upper Seine River was a &quot;prime gold area.&quot; Key mines included the Harold Lake Mine (1894-1896), the Hammond Reef Mine (1894-1922), and the Sawbill Mine (1897-1899).

===Seine River Diversion===
===Lower reaches===
Below Steeprock Lake, the river takes in the major left tributary Atikokan River and the minor left tributary Caribus Creek, then takes in the outflow from the Seine River Diversion on the right. It flows west over the Boyce Rapids, takes in the right tributary Eye River, passes through the Chubb Narrows and Banning Narrows, and reaches Calm Lake. The lake is controlled at the west end by the Calm Lake Dam and generating station (10 MW), built in 1926 and operated today by Abitibi-Consolidated Hydro. The river heads out of the lake southwest over the Manitou Rapids into Fin Bay on Laseine Lake. This lake is controlled at the west end by the Sturgeon Falls Dam and generating station (8 MW), also built in 1926 and also operated today by Abitibi-Consolidated Hydro.

The river heads west, is crossed by Ontario Highway 11, passes the community of Seine River Village (post office established in 1895 on the right bank, and reaches its mouth at Seine Bay on Rainy Lake.

Gold was discovered in the area by J.S. Campbell in 1893, which resulted in the Golden Crescent Mine. Other notable mines included the Foley Mine (1897-1898), the Gold Star Mine, and the Olive Mine (1897-1909). However, most of the mines in the area closed down with the collapse of the gold rush from 1903 to 1904.

<text>Mount Lindesay Highway is an Australian national highway located in Queensland. The highway runs southwest from Brisbane, where it leaves Ipswich Road in the suburb of Moorooka (as Beaudesert Road to the Logan Motorway), to the Queensland – New South Wales border and is in length. For most of its length it is roughly aligned with the Sydney–Brisbane rail corridor. At its southern end these transport routes take different passes over the Scenic Rim into the Northern Rivers region. It is designated National Route 13.

==State-controlled road==

Mount Lindesay Highway is a state-controlled road, subdivided into two sections for administrative and funding purposes. Section 25A is a regional road, while section 25B is part regional and part district. The sections are:

* 25A – Drewvale to Beaudesert
* 25B – Beaudesert to Mount Lindesay

==Route==
Mount Lindesay Highway commences at the intersection with Ipswich Road in Moorooka and heads in a southerly direction sign-posted as Beaudesert Road, through Brisbane&#x27;s southern suburban fringes, where it then crosses Logan Motorway. It continues south sign-posted as Mount Lindesay Highway through Jimboomba and Beaudesert, and onwards through the Scenic Rim region through Rathdowney, where the northern end of Lions Road tourist drive begins. South of Rathdowney the highway becomes very winding as it climbs the McPherson Range passing Mount Chinghee National Park, Mount Barney National Park and Border Ranges National Park on the way. The highway officially ends at the state border with New South Wales, where it continues south eventually to Casino and Grafton as Summerland Way.

==History==

Until the 1950s, the highway formed part of the main traffic route between Brisbane and Sydney. The coastal route (now the Pacific Highway) was not favoured due to the large number of ferry crossings of the wide coastal rivers, the frequency and severity of flooding of these rivers and the consequent poor state of much of the road for extended periods, and its steep, winding nature as it crossed the intermediate hills between each river valley.

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB, later Transport for NSW). Great Northern Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 9) on 8 August 1928, running from North Sydney via Hornsby, Peat&#x27;s Ferry, Gosford, Swansea, Newcastle, Maitland, Singleton, Tamworth, Armidale, Glen Innes, Tenterfield and Woodenbong to the border with Queensland; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 9 on 8 April 1929. This was renamed New England Highway, through Queensland on 14 February 1933, and a month later through New South Wales on 14 March 1933, running from Hexham, Maitland, Singleton, Tamworth, Armidale, Glen Innes, Tenterfield, Woodenbong and Beaudesert to Brisbane.

In November 1949, a sealed road was opened through Cunninghams Gap, linking south-western Brisbane to Warwick, to eventually supplant the route via Mount Lindesay as the main Brisbane-Sydney traffic route as far south as Tenterfield. As a result, New England Highway was re-routed through Warwick along the route that was then known in Queensland as the Lockyer-Darling Downs Highway on 11 August 1954. Against the wishes of the Beaudesert Shire Council and the Woodenbong Chamber of Commerce, the former alignment of New England Highway from Tenterfield through Beaudesert to Brisbane was re-declared Mount Lindesay Highway, after Mount Lindesay, the residue of a solidified magma core, that is part of the Mount Warning volcanic area and is situated in the western extreme of Border Ranges National Park. The NSW Department of Main Roads (which had succeeded the New South Wales MRB in 1932), declared the New South Wales section as State Highway 24, from Tenterfield via Legume and Woodenbong to the state border with Queensland.

The New South Wales section of Mount Lindesay Highway, which still included unsealed portions, was eventually de-gazetted as a highway by NSW Department of Main Roads on 23 December 1981 due to very low traffic volumes, it was renamed Mount Lindesay Road and re-declared as Main Road 622. This left the Queensland section as the only surviving part of the highway. Within New South Wales, Summerland Way was consequently extended north 9.4 km along the alignment of the former highway to meet the Queensland end of the highway at the state border, and the eastern end of Mount Lindesay Road was truncated at the intersection with Summerland Way just east of Woodenbong.

Between 2007 and 2009 of the highway in the Logan City local government area was upgraded. As well as providing dual carriageways, the work included building service roads so that local traffic does not have to travel on the main carriageways, thereby reducing congestion.

<text>Jules Marcou (April 20, 1824 – April 17, 1898) was a French-Swiss-American geologist.

==Biography==
He was born in Salins, in the &quot;département&quot; of Jura, in France. He was educated at Besançon and at the Collège Saint Louis, Paris. After completing his studies, he made several trips through Switzerland to recover his health. These travels led him to devote himself to natural science. During these travels, he met Jules Thurmann (1804–1855), who introduced him to Louis Agassiz.

During 1845, he worked with Thurmann on a geological survey of the Jura mountains. He was appointed assistant of the mineralogical department of the Sorbonne in 1846, and also classified its collection of fossils. During this time, he conducted geological investigations in various parts of Europe. In 1847 he went to North America as traveling geologist for the &quot;Jardin des Plantes&quot;, charged with studying the United States and the English possessions in North America. The next year, he joined Agassiz in Boston, and accompanied him to the Lake Superior region, visiting the copper mines of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Lake Huron, and Niagara. After six months, he returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and sent minerals he had collected to Paris.

In January 1849, Marcou directed his attention to the geology of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Later he crossed the Allegheny Mountains, visiting the Mammoth Cave and other localities, and then traversed Canada. He returned to Europe for a short time in 1850. In 1853 he published a &quot;Geological Map of the United States, and the British Provinces of North America&quot;. In 1853 he was hired by the United States government to serve as a geologist for the Pacific Railroad Survey along the 35th parallel, one of a series of explorations of the American West to find possible routes for a transcontinental railroad. In this role he became the first geologist to cross the United States. He subsequently made a geological section extending from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean.

In 1855 he became professor of geology and palaeontology at the polytechnic school of Zürich, but relinquished this office in 1859. His &quot;Lettres sur les roches du Jura et leur distribution géographique dans les deux hémisphères&quot; (published 1857...1860) included one of the earliest proposals that a land bridge had once existed between the Old World and New World.

In 1861 again returned to the United States, when he assisted Louis Agassiz in initiating the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and was in charge of its palaeontological division from 1860 to 1864. Subsequently, he devoted himself to scientific research until 1875, when he again began service for the United States government, and accompanied the Wheeler Survey to Southern California.

== Personal life and death ==
Jules Marcou married Jane Belknap of Boston in 1850. They had two children. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1898 and was interred there in Mount Auburn Cemetery.

<text>Yuan Mei (; 1716–1797) was a Chinese poet of the Qing Dynasty. He was often mentioned with Ji Yun as the &quot;Nan Yuan Bei Ji&quot; ().

==Biography==

===Early life===
Yuan Mei was born in Qiantang (, in modern Hangzhou), Zhejiang province, to a cultured family who had never before attained high office. He achieved the degree of &quot;jinshi&quot; in 1739 at the young age of 23 and was immediately appointed to the Hanlin Academy (). Then, from 1742 to 1748, Yuan Mei served as a magistrate in four different locations in Jiangsu. However, in 1748, shortly after being assigned to administer part of Nanjing, he resigned his post and returned to his hometown to pursue his literary interest.

===Literary career===

In the decades before his death, Yuan Mei produced a large body of poetry, essays and paintings. His works reflected his interest in Chan Buddhism and the supernatural, at the expense of Daoism and institutional Buddhism - both of which he rejected. Yuan is most famous for his poetry, which has been described as possessing &quot;unusually clear and elegant language&quot;. His views on poetry as expressed in the () stressed the importance of personal feeling and technical perfection. In his later years, Yuan Mei came to be called &quot;Mister Suiyuan&quot; (). Among his other collected works are treatises on passing the imperial examinations and on food.

Throughout his lifetime, Yuan Mei travelled extensively throughout southern China, visiting Huangshan, Guilin, Tiantai, Wuyi and other famous mountains. On some of those visits, Yuan kept journal entries, representative of which is the &quot;You Guilin zhu shan ji&quot; (&quot;Record of tours of the mountains of Guilin&quot;). He also accepted students. Since he admired women&#x27;s poetry, he also took several female students and helped them publish their work under their own names.

=== Beliefs and women&#x27;s literacy ===
Yuan was opposed to the strict moral and aesthetic norms of his day and valued creativity and self-expression. He advocated for women&#x27;s literacy. Yuan was both famed and criticized for his Sui Garden where women would gather to compose and recite poetry. Two of Yuan&#x27;s sisters enjoyed praise for their literary talent.

== Wonder tales ==

His anthology of supernatural tales, the &quot;Zi buyu&quot; ( lit. &quot;What the Master does not Speak of&quot;, i.e., &quot;Censored by Confucius&quot;) was first published 1788, and later retitled &quot;Xin Qi xie&quot; (; &quot;New wonder tales from Qi&quot;). It contained some 747 tales, followed by a sequel anthology.

The work is classified under the &quot;biji&quot; fiction genre), but they are anecdotes collected over many years, purporting to be actual events recorded by the author.

== Gastronomic work ==

The food writer Fuchsia Dunlop has described Yuan as &quot;China’s Brillat-Savarin,&quot; and Endymion Wilkinson called him one of the four classical gastronomes. In a time when the taste among his contemporaries was for opulence and exotic display, Yuan stood for the &quot;orthodox&quot; style. &quot;Nowadays,&quot; he wrote, &quot;at the start of the feast the menu is about a hundred feet long&quot;. This is &quot;mere display, not gastronomy&quot;. After one such dinner Yuan returned home and cooked congee to appease his hunger. He instructed cooks &quot;do not fuss with the natural state of the food just to show that you are a clever cook. Bird&#x27;s nest is beautiful -- why shape it into balls?&quot; Yuan criticized his contemporary Li Liweng&#x27;s magnolia pudding as &quot;created by artifice&quot;. Yuan also resented what he regarded as the corruption of Chinese food by Manchu cooks. The appeal of Manchu cooking was in their stews and roasts, while Chinese cooked broths and soups, but when Manchus serve Chinese dinners and Chinese serve Manchu food, &quot;we lose our originality&quot; and we &quot;toady to each other&quot;.

Yuan published his recipes and thoughts on cooking in his 1792 gastronomic manual and cookbook The Way of Eating. A complete and annotated translation was published in 2019.

<text>The Retiro Park (Spanish: , literally &quot;Good Retreat Park&quot;), also known as Buen Retiro Park or simply El Retiro, is one of the largest city parks in Madrid, Spain. The park belonged to the Spanish monarchy until 1868, when it became a public park following the Glorious Revolution. The park is located at the edge of the city centre, near both the Puerta de Alcalá and the Museo del Prado, and covers . It has gardens, monuments, galleries, an artificial lake, and event-hosting venues. In 2021, Buen Retiro Park became part of a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site that also includes Paseo del Prado.

==History==
In 1505, the Jeronimites monastery was moved to a new Isabelline Gothic-style building at the present-day site of the Church of Saint Jerome the Royal. The royal family had a retreat built as part of the new church. King Philip II (ruled 1556–1598) moved the Spanish court to Madrid in 1561. Philip had the Retiro enlarged under the direction of his architect Juan Bautista de Toledo, who also formally laid out tree-lined avenues. 

The gardens were extended in the 1620s, when Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, gave the king several tracts of adjacent land for the court&#x27;s recreational use. Olivares, with the king&#x27;s permission, drew up plans for a royal residence far more grand than the existing villas, which had been built for Roman nobles. Although this second royal residence was to be built in what were then outlying areas of Madrid, it would also be in an ideal location, not far from the existing alcázar. In the 1630s, the palace buildings were constructed under the supervision of the architects Giovanni Battista Crescenzi and Alonso Carbonell. Two of the buildings remain today: the Casón del Buen Retiro, which served as a ballroom, and the Hall of Realms. 

The Count-Duke of Olivares commissioned the park in the 1630s. It was designed by Cosimo Lotti, a landscaper and engineer who had previously worked on the layout of the Boboli Gardens. The layout of the gardens were defined by key water features, including the great pond, the great canal, the narrow channel, and the chamfered (or bellflower) pond. Buen Retiro became the center of Habsburg court life for much of the Spanish Golden Age. During the reigns of Philip IV and Charles II, several plays were performed in the park for the royal family and the court.


The gardens were initially neglected after the death of Philip IV in 1665, but have been restored and changed on many occasions. Philip V ordered the creation of a parterre, the only French-style garden in the complex. During the reign of Ferdinand VI, Buen Retiro was the setting for Italian operas. Charles III () ordered the replacement of the old walls with wrought-iron railings. The Buen Retiro Palace was used until the era of Charles III. Juan de Villanueva&#x27;s Astronomical Observatory was built during the reign of Charles IV (). 

Most of the palace and its gardens were destroyed during the Peninsular War (1807–1814) when the troops of the First French Empire built the Citadel of Madrid on park grounds. The park went through many changes during Queen Isabella II&#x27;s reign. More trees were planted and previously unplanted areas were landscaped. In 1868, when Queen Isabella was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, the gardens became publicly-owned.

In 1883, the park hosted the Exposición Nacional de Minería. 14 hectares of the park served as fairgrounds of the 1887 Philippines Exposition, which included a human zoo. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Monument to Alfonso XII of Spain, designed by José Grases Riera, was built next to the pond. Countless statues, fountains and commemorative monuments have filled the park, converting it into an open-air sculpture museum. New gardens were created during the 1930s and 1940s, attributed to Chief Gardener Cecilio Rodriguez, who also built the rose garden.

==Features==

Close to the northern entrance of the park is the (Retirement Pond), a large artificial pond. Nearby is the monument to King Alfonso XII, featuring a semicircular colonnade and an equestrian statue of the monarch on top of a tall central core.

The (Rose Garden) is an early 20th-century feature inspired by the Bagatelle rose garden in the Bois de Boulogne. 
Beside the roses stands the Fountain of the Fallen Angel, erected in 1922, whose main sculpture &quot;El Angel Caído&quot; is a work by Ricardo Bellver (1845–1924) inspired by a passage from John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which represents Lucifer falling from Heaven. It is claimed that this statue is the only known public monument of Satan. The few remaining buildings of the Buen Retiro Palace, including Casón del Buen Retiro and the Salon de Reinos, now house museum collections. The Casón has a collection of 19th- and 20th-century paintings, including art by the Spanish painter Joaquín Sorolla.

Since assuming its role as a public park in the late 19th century, Buen Retiro Park has been used as a venue for various international exhibitions. Several themed buildings have remained as a testament to such events, including the Mining Building, popularly known as the Velázquez Palace (1884) by architect Ricardo Velázquez Bosco, who designed the &quot;Palacio de Cristal&quot; (Crystal Palace), a glass pavilion inspired by The Crystal Palace in London, undoubtedly the gardens&#x27; most extraordinary building. Built along with its artificial pond in 1887 for the Philippine Islands Exhibitions, the Palacio de Cristal was first used to display flower species indigenous to the archipelago. The landscape-style gardens in the former &quot;Campo Grande&quot; are also a reminder of the international exhibitions that have taken place here in the past.

The Paseo de la Argentina, also known as &quot;Paseo de las Estatuas&quot; (Statue Walk), is decorated with some of the statues of kings from the Royal Palace, sculpted between 1750 and 1753. There are art galleries in the Crystal Palace, &quot;Palacio de Velázquez&quot; and &quot;Casa de Vacas&quot;. Also in the Retiro Park is the Forest of Remembrance (), a memorial monument to commemorate the 191 victims of the 2004 Madrid train bombings.

==Activities==

Every Sunday from late May through early October, the Banda Sinfónica de Madrid gives free midday concerts from the bandstand in the park near the Calle de Alcalá. Manuel Lillo Torregrosa composed &quot;Kiosko del Retiro&quot; for this bandstand. The park features an annual Book Fair where people can drop off or sell their used books, magazines, or newspapers. Events throughout the year include concerts, firework shows, and holiday festivals, and cultural events.

Retiro Park has specific outdoor exercise areas for young and old people. The elderly exercise area includes stretching equipment and bicycle pedals. The youth area includes bars for triceps dips, pull-ups, and sit-ups, as well as large stones that locals have brought to use as weights.

Around the Retiro Pond lake, many puppet shows, street performers, and fortune tellers perform. Rowboats can be rented to paddle around the Estanque, and horse-drawn carriages are available. Retiro is home to multiple city-managed sports courts and several playground areas. The inside of the Palacio de Cristal has been modified to include a stone slide. Major paths and walkways in the park are used by families, runners, bikers and rollerbladers.

<doc id="937279" wikidata="Q7810879" url="?curid=937279" title="To Catch the Uncatchable">
<text>To Catch the Uncatchable (棟篤神探) is a 25-episode TV drama series produced by TVB of Hong Kong, which stars Dayo Wong as the genius (albeit physically weak and with asthma) CID Mok Tsok Tung (莫作棟) and Ada Choi as Vivi Lee Wai Wai (李慧慧), an insurance agent, with Marco Ngai and Michael Tong as major background characters.
The title of the series is of Cantonese word-play and innuendo (the title itself means &quot;The Hilarious God Detective&quot;), and the series itself sets itself apart from other TVB comedies before it thanks largely to the comedic stylings of Dayo Wong, plus new styles of acting and directing and camera work, different styles of plots unheard of before in comedies, and a surprisingly tragic conclusion. The conclusion was met with mixed reception with many complaining it was too upsetting for a comedy. An alternate ending featuring a happy ending was later released.

==Plot==
The drama is centered around the exploits of Detective Mok (Wong) unmasking murderer that seemingly related somehow to either his &quot;rival&quot; Vivi (Choi). or getting critical inspiration from unorthodox sources, such as old television programs that his mother (whose face is not seen until later into the series) starred in, which Mok then translates in his investigative work...sometimes to the chagrin of Vivi, who often finds herself at the butt of Mok&#x27;s investigations.

Thanks to these machinations, Vivi concludes that Mok is the source of her bad luck, which of course leads to her becoming suspected of a number of the murders. However, besides Mok, Vivi has a few thorns of her own: the despicable rival agent and lady-killer Romeo Lo Mat-au (羅密歐, derisively called 蘿蔔歐 &quot;lo bak au&quot;, which is a derogatory term for Japanese people) by Vivi (played by Marco Ngai), and a clueless smitten admirer in her personal trainer Jim (played by Michael Tong).

As the plot goes on, the couple found out they are, in fact, in love with each other. In later episodes, Mok was rendered unconscious by a murderer using a glass bottle which, coincidentally happened to Jim Jim. Reviving a month later because the blood clot moved, he proposed to Vivi right away. Later, his friend Dr. Yu (played by Hu Fung/胡楓) revealed to him that the blood clot in his brain is moving to a spot that will kill him instantly without any forewarning, unlike Jim Jim, whose clot moved to a safe spot, a bit of news that Mok decided to hide the fact as to keep everyone happy.

In the last episode, while taking a wedding photo with Vivi, Mok spotted a thief sneaking into another&#x27;s bag and decided to rush out and chase the thief. After chasing the thief, Mok finally caught a thief for the &quot;first&quot; time in his career. After handing the criminal to his colleagues on duty, he told Vivi that he will be returning in 5 minutes on the phone.

In the original ending of the show, after he hung up, he falls down looking towards the sky seemingly happy. Scenes of memories and sorrow background music &quot;Someplace Good&quot; kicks in, with the show ending with the wedding photo of the couple turning black and white with Mok slowly fading away, leaving Vivi alone in the photo, which implies that Mok had died after falling down.

This ending received a large amount of feedback; in which one side praised it for its groundbreaking, unorthodox dour ending in a comedy drama, in contrast to TVB&#x27;s usual endings (also known as the &quot;happily-ever-after-plus&quot; ending.) The other side criticized it for the unexpectedly dour ending in a comedy drama, which was too sharp of a contrast to the lightness of the series.

The latter opinion won out after they flooded newspapers, internet forums and newsgroups, and TVB claims that it is an original unedited ending, in which Mok still falls down but managed to get back to the photo shoot, albeit pensively. The alternate ending was shown on 27 August 2004 in local entertainment programme TVB Starbiz (娛樂大搜查), and was not included in any subsequent releases overseas.

The original reports of a sequel for To Catch the Uncatchable suggest that the 2005 Women On the Run (窈窕熟女) is the sequel, despite Women on the Run not being touted as such. Women on the Run has almost none of the original cast from TCTUC in it.

==Characters==

===Mok Cheok Tung (莫作棟)===
A clever yet frail CID of the Hong Kong police force, he uses unorthodox methods and picks up on the strangest of clues that somehow ends up a) involving Vivi in the case and b) busting the correct criminal, sometimes ahead of his boss, the befuddled Inspector- Sze Ko But, whose name rhymes with &quot;stupid&quot;. Also, Inspector Gadget. Although he was supposed to marry Vivian during the final episode, he was caught up in catching a criminal but started wheezing and supposedly died. The last scene was a montage of Vivian taking wedding pictures by herself and Tung disappears from their wedding photo.

===Vivian Lee (李慧慧)===
The &quot;female strongperson&quot; as described by Mok, in the beginning she truly believes that Mok is the one who causes all of her miseries, especially when many of the cases Mok solves during the series somehow involves her, which causes her coworkers to gossip behind her back and attract the unwanted attention of Lo Mat-au, whom she later enjoys a victory before falling to almost certain defeat after Lo&#x27;s promotion.

During the series, she ends up falling for the man she began despising for the miseries he allegedly were causing her, and the two tie the knot. However, the ending of the series proves inconclusive as to how long they lasted. She ends up marrying Mok.

===Romeo (Lo Mat-Au)/Daikon (lo bak-au)(羅密歐)===
Vivi&#x27;s rival project manager at the Universal Insurance Company; a cunning and conniving man who charms his way into someone&#x27;s good books before stabbing them into the back to claim the riches for himself. With female clients he charms them, and after he fails to replace Simon as District Manager, he charms the Acting District Manager (Vivi) whilst trying to slight her in front of her chargers, which backfires as Vivi cleverly counters each and every move which frustrates him to no end.

Romeo is often called &quot;lo bat-tau&quot; by Vivi, which literally means &quot;daikon head&quot;, but it is often used as a derogatory term for Japanese people.

However, after some clever maneuvers, Romeo finally ends up convincing the Boss to demote Vivi from her position to be replaced by him. But in the end his big ego does him in, for he was caught by Mok (who was undercover and in drag) for distributing illegal substances in a drag bar to his wealthy Mainland clients. As a result of the bad press, Romeo was fired and was never heard from again.

===Jim Jim (詹霑)===
A physical trainer born in Toronto, the character played by Michael Tong develops unrequited feelings for Vivi in the series when himself, Mok and Vivi end up training in the same gym. He was initially unaware of Vivi&#x27;s complete disregard for his feelings, which is caused by Vivi&#x27;s inability to express to Jim Jim directly that she has no feelings for him.

<doc id="937299" wikidata="Q707126" url="?curid=937299" title="George Julius Poulett Scrope">
<text>George Julius Poulett Scrope FRS (10 March 1797 – 19 January 1876) was an English geologist and political economist as well as a Member of Parliament and magistrate for Stroud in Gloucestershire.

While an undergraduate at Cambridge, through the influence of Edward Clarke and Adam Sedgwick he became interested in mineralogy and geology. During the winter of 1816–1817 he was at Naples, and was so keenly interested in Vesuvius that he renewed his studies of the volcano in 1818; and in the following year visited Etna and the Lipari Islands. In 1821 he married the daughter and heiress of William Scrope of Castle Combe, Wiltshire, and assumed her name; and he entered the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1833 as MP for Stroud, retaining his seat until 1868.

Meanwhile he began to study the volcanic regions of central France in 1821, and visited the Eifel district in 1823. In 1825 he published &quot;Considerations on Volcanos&quot;, leading to the establishment of a new theory of the Earth, and in the following year was elected FRS. This earlier work was subsequently amplified and issued under the title of &quot;Volcanos&quot; (1862); an authoritative text-book of which a second edition was published ten years later. In 1827 he issued his classic &quot;Memoir on the Geology of Central France, including the Volcanic formations of Auvergne, the Velay and the Vivarais&quot;, a quarto volume illustrated by maps and plates. The substance of this was reproduced in a revised and somewhat more popular form in &quot;The Geology and Extinct Volcanos of Central France&quot; (1858). These books were the first widely published descriptions of the Chaîne des Puys, a chain of over 70 small volcanoes in the Massif Central.

Scrope was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1867. Among his other works was the &quot;History of the Manor and Ancient Barony of Castle Combe&quot; (printed for private circulation, 1852).

==Biography==

===Early life===
On 10 March 1797, George Julius Thomson was born in London to &quot;John Thomson of Waverley Abbey, Surrey, and his wife, Charlotte&quot; and was baptized under this name a few months later. John Thomson was the head of a successful trading firm (one source alluded that it was Roehampton and Austin Friars, London) that had dealings with Russia. His wife, Charlotte, was the daughter of well-to-do Doctor John Jacob of Salisbury.

George was the second son of John and Charlotte. Charles was the firstborn. The two brothers maintained a close friendship until Charles&#x27; &quot;untimely death&quot; in a riding accident in Canada. George and Charles cooperatively wrote Charles&#x27; autobiography.

Not much has been documented about George&#x27;s early and teen years, and his personal letters were left to his nephew Hugh Hammersley, but have been misplaced or destroyed. The sources reviewed by this researcher almost exclusively began with the circumstances of Thomson&#x27;s birth and then resumed at his entry to Harrow at roughly thirteen years of age.

===Education===
Thomson received his education at Harrow School, a privately funded public school in the Harrow district of London.

After Harrow, Thomson was accepted to and enrolled at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1815. After a year he left Pembroke because he found that its science departments were lacking courses of interest to him. To sate his scientific appetite, he transferred to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1816. Also, during this year Thomson &quot;acquired the additional name Poulett, which his father had recently adopted from an earlier and aristocratic branch of his family.&quot;

Once at St. John&#x27;s, Thomson was introduced to Professors Edward Daniel Clarke and Adam Sedgwick who &quot;gave him his lifelong interest in geology.&quot; At the time these men were in the early stages of their careers, Clarke having been made the first professor of mineralogy within the field of geology at St. John&#x27;s; Sedgwick being known for his attention to detail and his naming of certain sections of the geologic time scale including the Cambrian. Thomson received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1821 in geology, after having performed several years of fieldwork in continental Europe.

===Social life===
After a comfortable courtship, Thomson was married to Emma Phipps Scrope on 22 March 1821. She was the heiress of William Scrope (phonetically Scroop) of Castle Combe, Wiltshire, which is north-east of Bath. She was also the great-granddaughter of Sir Robert Long, 6th Baronet. After a Royal Grant he assumed the name and arms of Scrope, in lieu of Thomson. The newly renamed George Poulett Scrope and his wife resided at Castle Combe Manor House, which the Scrope family had owned since the fourteenth century. Emma had been disabled after a riding accident soon after the marriage, and no children were born of their union. Scrope had extensive alterations made to the 17th-century house and established formal gardens in the grounds.

During the marriage, George Poulett Scrope kept a mistress, an actress known as Mrs. Grey, in a comfortable existence in London. Around the year 1838 their son was born, whom they called Arthur Hamilton. Scrope sent his illegitimate son to Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford for his education, eventually securing a commission for him. In 1856, Emma and George formally adopted Arthur as their son.

After Emma&#x27;s death in 1866, Scrope sold Castle Combe and moved to Fairlawn, near Cobham, Surrey. The following year he married Margaret Elizabeth Savage, who was forty-four years his junior. Both Margaret Scrope and Arthur survived him.

===Study of volcanoes===
During the time he attended St. John&#x27;s College, Scrope had his first real experiences with what would become his geologic specialty – volcanoes – and what would be called igneous petrology. During the winter break of 1817 through 1818, George went on a vacation with his mother and father in Italy. In Naples he explored Mount Vesuvius and other areas of volcanism in the region.

In 1825, Scrope became a secretary, jointly with Sir Charles Lyell, of the Geological Society of London. His later results from Auvergne were published for his 1826 election to the Royal Society. In 1853, Scrope was instrumental in the formation of and became the first president of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, contributing heavily to its magazine.

&quot;[The] experience [in Naples] first aroused his lifelong fascination with volcanoes&quot; and soon after his marriage to Emma Phipps he went on a series of expeditions in Auvergne, France, Southern Italy, the Pontine Islands, Eifel, and other areas of notable current or past volcanism. Scrope was present during the great Vesuvian eruption of 1822 which he deemed, according to his &quot;Geology and Extinct Volcanos of Central France&quot;, &quot;by far the most important eruption of Vesuvius that ha[d] occurred during this century.&quot;

Upon his return to England Scrope wrote, in an effort &quot;to put [his] views clearly before the world as a contribution to sound knowledge and a step towards the demolition of ... errors still prevalent&quot; in the theories related to volcanism and Neptunism. This work, &quot;Considerations on Volcanoes&quot;, written in 1825, &quot;is regarded as the earliest systematic treatise on volcanology [and] the first attempt to frame a ... theory of volcanic action and ... show the part ... volcanoes have played in the Earth&#x27;s History.&quot;

At the time of publication, however, &quot;Considerations&quot; was not very well received. Scrope commented in his &quot;Geology and Extinct Volcanos&quot; that Sir Charles Lyell wrote his first essay in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; for May 1827 reviewing the work, and was one of the few who gave it any public praise. Scrope couldn&#x27;t resist giving Lyell a little barb when he commented on Lyell&#x27;s career as a critic as following &quot;the path of geological generalisation which he has since so successfully pursued.&quot; Despite its initial poor reception, &quot;Considerations&quot; did help spark the curiosity of numerous other scientists and sent ripples in the Wernerian theory.

According to Abraham Gottlob Werner, the first phase of the Earth&#x27;s development featured a great global ocean. This ocean was hot, steamy, and full of suspended sediment that eventually precipitated and formed bedrock. After this, the global ocean supposedly cooled and settled to such a degree that it began to subside and eventually conform to match the features seen today. During this time of subsidence, mountains were left behind as artifacts of erosion or a similar mechanism.

Scrope was not satisfied with this explanation of the presence and formation of rocks. He and many of his contemporaries were probably disturbed by the sense of utter finality, the idea that the earth was in a stage of winding down and would see no further development or change. George spent much time performing research locally and discussing the matter with colleagues.

In 1827, Scrope published his research from Auvergne in central France in his &quot;Geology and Extinct Volcanos of Central France&quot;. This work contained meticulously detailed drawings of basaltic column clusters, numerous panoramic views of valleys, and cross-sections of sedimentation and other types of stratigraphy. The work reads as a moving narrative, giving a very detailed road-map of analyzed data through the region.

In response to the release of this work, Sir Charles Lyell spearheaded an expeditionary force soon after to corroborate Scrope&#x27;s findings and help build a case against Neptunism. After the group of natural philosophers returned, Lyell and Murchison confirmed the validity of Scrope&#x27;s arguments. With the weight of their respective reputations and their findings behind him, Scrope ensured that &quot;Werner&#x27;s doctrine of the aqueous precipitation of basalt received from this work its death-blow.&quot; Scrope wrote later in his &quot;Geology and Extinct Volcanos&quot; that &quot;The Wernerian notion ... has since that date never held up its head.&quot;

Since his beginnings as a geologist, George Poulett Scrope fostered a number of friendly relationships with some well-known natural philosophers. On his voyage and during the years since, Charles Darwin sent some letters to Scrope, checking certain geological observations and calculations he made, and made other general geology and scientific (in our modern terms) queries. These documents are mentioned by numerous sources, but were unavailable for review by this researcher.

During the mid-1820s, George Poulett Scrope came upon the greatest friendship of his life. Despite, and perhaps because of, Charles Lyell&#x27;s objective appraisals of Scrope&#x27;s first and certain subsequent works, the pair forged a strong friendship that lasted for the rest of their lives. While Lyell&#x27;s uniformitarianist views were not to George&#x27;s liking, he found solace in Professor Huxley&#x27;s theories.

One author described the early nineteenth century, the time of George Poulett Scrope and Charles Lyell&#x27;s early careers, as an &quot;intellectual &#x27;reign of terror&#x27;&quot; which was the &quot;consequence of the unreasoning prejudice and wild alarm excited by the early progress of geological inquiry.&quot; Most attempts to explain the past using current processes as a reference was, rather than through calm argument, met by social stigma and intolerance. This can be seen by the treatment of Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Earth,&quot; Hall&#x27;s meticulously kept records and experiments, and Playfair&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations.&quot; These arguments had &quot;come to be inscribed in a social Index Expurgatorius [and] might have seemed to be consigned to total oblivion.&quot; The writer of Scrope&#x27;s Obituary in the Royal Society&#x27;s Proceedings believed that &quot;science is indebted for boldly encountering and successfully overcoming this storm of prejudice ... [Scrope and Lyell] accomplish[ed] the removal of geology from the domain of speculation to that of inductive science.&quot;

Based on Scrope&#x27;s various arguments, he became a Huttonian in that he did believe that causes in operation currently were able to have produced past geological changes – the present is a key to explaining the past. He rejected aqueous origins and Von Buch&#x27;s elevation-crater theory – which held that craters were caused by the buckling of the crust below them.

Because the friendship of Scrope and Lyell featured a &quot;freedom of intercourse&quot; it was of great value to the pair in fighting conventional thought and its errors. Lyell wrote favourable reviews of several of Scrope&#x27;s papers during the 1820s and 1830s, lending some of his considerable influence. Upon the release of Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, on parts of which he had extensive correspondence with Scrope, George was &quot;committed the congenial task of applying and driving home [their arguments].&quot; To this end, the first and second volumes of &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; were introduced by &quot;appreciative and discriminative notices in the Quarterly [Review]&quot; which were written by his friend Scrope. The third edition of the series was also favourably reviewed by Mr. Scrope.

===Political career===
Around the year 1821, Scrope was made a magistrate and was affected with the hardships of the agricultural laborer. &quot;Thenceforth his interest in economic and political affairs, tho [sic] it did not exclude his interest in geology, was unabated.&quot; Scrope turned his considerable mind and talents of persuasion to the problems he saw.

An unusually articulate magistrate, Scrope communicated his views on current problems in letters to magistrate colleagues and in many pamphlets. Over the course of his life, George Poulett Scrope wrote more than seventy politically and economically charged pamphlets, earning him a common nickname of &quot;Pamphlet Scrope.&quot;

Scrope perhaps felt that his efficacy was limited if he remained only a local politician. In 1832, Scrope ran for the Parliamentary seat of Stroud, which he did not succeed in obtaining. However, one of the successful candidates, David Ricardo, shortly accepted the Chiltern Hundreds for reasons of family health, and Scrope was returned for the seat unopposed. He remained active in politics until 1867.

In the House of Commons, Mr. Scrope was not very vocal. He was, however, an avid writer. Professor Bonney, the original author of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;&#x27;s , credited him with thirty-six papers on the subjects of volcanic geology and petrology. In his &quot;A Neglected English Economist: George Poulett Scrope&quot;, Redvers Opie estimated that if his entries to places such as the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, which were largely anonymous, were to be figured into the list of his total works, then &quot;there are extant over forty books, pamphlets, and papers on political economy&quot; concerning both practical and theoretical issues.

The first economic publication that can be definitely attributed to Scrope is &quot;A Plea for the Abolition of Slavery in England, as produced by an illegal abuse of the Poor Law, common in the southern counties&quot; which was written in 1829. Scrope was interested in the relationship between political economy and the other moral sciences.

Scrope heavily contributed to the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;&#x27;s Economic section. &quot;Scrope&#x27;s articles had three main themes: (1) the failure of accepted political economy to give sufficient weight to changes in aggregate demand and to the resulting possibility that under some situations an artificial demand could put to use resources … otherwise unemployed.&quot; This essentially recommended that an artificially determined demand could stimulate available capital and the market.

Secondly, Scrope lamented the &quot;evil effects of falling prices on total production as well as on the distribution of income and the need for banking reform to raise prices on the existing gold standard.&quot; Scrope advocated that a tabular standard be instituted, allowing the banking system and the economy to keep up with the market. Jevons eventually aided in inserting the tabular standard, but gave large credit to Scrope and Lowe, who independently co-discovered it.

The third primary theme of Scrope’s articles to the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, according to Frank Whitson Fetter, is the &quot;fallacies of Malthusian population doctrine and of the current proposals for sweeping reform of the poor laws that were based on the acceptance of the Malthusian view [that they be administered to] discourage population increase.&quot; Scrope was an opponent of Ricardo&#x27;s Malthusian ideas as well. Ricardo was an accomplished economist and a Member of Parliament for Port Arlington during the years 1819-1823.

Scrope rejected Ricardo&#x27;s definition of &quot;rent theory&quot; which was, according to the Wikipedia entry under Ricardo&#x27;s name (cited below), &quot;the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labor.&quot;

The model for this theory of rent essentially stated that while only one grade of land is used for agriculture, rent will not exist, but when multiple grades of land are being utilized, rent will be exacted on the higher grades and will increase with the rise of the grade. &quot;As such, Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land utilisation and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, benefited first and foremost the landowners because they would receive the rent payments either in money or in product.&quot;

To his &quot;Principles of Political Economy, deduced from the Natural Laws of Social Welfare, and applied to the Present state of Britain&quot; he prefixed it as a &quot;Preliminary Discourse on the coincidence of the rights, duties and interests of man in society&quot; in an effort to define &quot;the true scope and limits of political economy, and also of establishing a ground-work of axiomatic principles with respect to the rights of individuals and the duties of governments.&quot; He felt that up to that point, such an endeavor had not whole-heartedly been made.

Opie wrote that the pages devoted to natural principles &quot;breathe the spirit of the eighteenth century,&quot; and can be seen in his fondness for Butler and Hume. Scrope was anti-anarchist and refused to allow certain extreme interpretations of &quot;natural law&quot; philosophy to lead him to it. And just as he avoided the finality of the Wernerian system, so too did he reject the &quot;Panglossian stagnation which makes all things which are, eternal.&quot; Scrope, however, avoided the other extreme which was state paternalism.

To counter arguments against these positions, he repudiated &quot;whatever is, is right,&quot; if applied to actions of man or to justifications for existing institutions and their practices. Scrope felt that it was generally assumed that physical and mental satisfaction and happiness of man &quot;&#x27;may be most materially influenced by his social arrangements and these arrangements are susceptible of great and indefinite … improvement.&#x27;&quot;

To George Poulett Scrope, the primary aim or goal in forming institutions should be to see to &quot;&#x27;the greatest happiness of the greatest number [of parties].&#x27;&quot; Scrope did not accept another utilitarian tendency in thought that &quot;&#x27;every action of man has necessarily a selfish motive.&#x27;&quot;

While it is true that Scrope studied political economy, which examined the impact of production and distribution of wealth and the happiness of those parties involved, he was &quot;frankly interested in welfare economics, altho [sic] aware of the indefiniteness of the end,&quot; using the available facts, vague though they may be, to make generalizations possible for the masses of data involved. The principles of this science are made up of things deducted from axioms relative to the emotions and actions of men. These actions, to George Poulett Scrope, are to be gleaned from observation of experience. Scrope made numerous appeals to experience in his discussions of natural rights.

To Scrope, the general welfare was always in the back of his mind. &quot;The right of property depends upon the &#x27;principle of utility&#x27; which is itself … a generalisation per enumerationem simplicem.&quot; The same is true of the foundations of &quot;free labour and free disposal of its produce.&quot; So while he saw that experience teaches that &quot;aggregate production increases with the progress of division of labor … it also teaches that men will move to the point of maximum return for their effort.&quot;

These concepts allow interesting interpretations to take place. Scrope followed the chain of experience to the conclusion that if the various parties involved are &quot;left free to settle terms with each other&quot; there will result a fair distribution of their claims on the joint produce. Thus the parties involved can, in this way, attempt to avoid a situation which currently may be associated with John Nash&#x27;s equilibriums, where the squabbling of both parties minimizes the gains on either end. The outcome of these situations, if left to their course, may, so Scrope implies, reach a social optimum (another current term) where all parties involved seek to have secure gains on both sides – for the greater good.

Scrope recognized the underlying self-interest in humans and realized that in the exercise of freedom of individual action, &quot;&#x27;the unerring instinct of self-interest&#x27; has played its part in constructing a society more complexly coöperative than could be achieved by mortal design … [thus] Institutions must work with and not against the operation of self-interest&quot; for society to thrive.

With regards to poverty, Scrope seemed to prefer a &quot;let&#x27;s grow more food now and worry about declining population later&quot; stand. To help this along, Scrope advocated emigration to the various British colonies as the strongest solution to the problem. He was, however, criticized for &quot;treating emigration as a panacea for all social ills.&quot;

Although Scrope did not have a particularly active political life, his brother Charles Thomson did. With much advising behind the scenes, Charles rose to political prominence and was eventually made Lord Sydenham. As part of his new duties, he was engaged in much economic and political discourse, for which he had quite a sound mind. He was responsible for implementing the Union Act in 1840, which united Upper Canada and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada. Eventually Charles became Governor General of Canada until his death in 1841.

To his constituents, George Poulett Scrope was deemed an &quot;enlightened [aristocratic] landlord and a compassionate magistrate&quot; and nationally he attacked the current poor laws and Malthusian doctrine. He expressed the view that the proper goal of the economist was to &quot;promote social welfare, using the generation of wealth&quot; as a means to this end.

===Later life===

In his later years, Scrope began to withdraw from political life. His &quot;decaying strength and increasing blindness compelled him to [retire]&quot; and during this time he released new editions of earlier works. During these years he gave counsel and kind words, in addition to helpful hints in research methodology and direction, to many young geologists. Lyell was also stricken with progressive blindness, bringing another ironic note to the pair&#x27;s friendship.

Scrope received numerous accolades for his ventures in the fields of geology, politics, and history. His history of Castle Combe, written in 1852, is still accepted as an important work in such scholarship, and numerous pleasant comments regarding it were made in various Stroud and local media. Scrope also penned definitive biographies and analyses on local and national British figures during his lifetime, earning him honorable mention in numerous related publications. In 1867, for his groundbreaking work in geology, the Geological Society of London awarded George Poulett Scrope the Wollaston Medal – their highest award.

The death of Lyell, his lifelong best friend, left him a broken man and he soon followed on 19 January 1876. Judd, in his Academy obituary of George Poulett Scrope, wrote that &quot;born within a few months of one another, their deaths were separated by less than a year; &#x27;lovely and pleasant in their lives, in their death they were not divided.&#x27;&quot; Many would agree with Judd&#x27;s statement that Scrope was an earnest worker in the task of &quot;establishing the science of geology on a philosophical basis.&quot;

<text>Bowling for Soup is an American rock band formed in Wichita Falls, Texas, in 1994. The band consists of Jaret Reddick (lead vocals, guitar), Gary Wiseman (drums, percussion), and Rob Felicetti (bass, backing vocals, acoustic guitar). The band is best known for its singles &quot;Girl All the Bad Guys Want&quot;, &quot;1985&quot;, &quot;Almost&quot; and &quot;High School Never Ends&quot;. The band is also known for performing the theme song for the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;. Reddick is the only original member as of 2025.

==History==

===Early years===
Bowling for Soup has its origins in Wichita Falls, Texas, where Jaret Reddick and other members of the band grew up. Reddick and original drummer Lance Morrill met in the fall of 1976. Reddick began playing music in 1985, at 13 years old. Reddick and guitarist Chris Burney knew each other in high school (they met in 1986) and as students in the 1980s, they grew up on the commercially successful heavy metal music of bands such as Quiet Riot, RATT, and Mötley Crüe, but were also influenced by the faster punk rock of the Ramones and later Green Day. Burney&#x27;s family owned a Wichita Falls coffeehouse called &quot;The Refuge&quot; with a music stage and he played there with his first band the Persecuted, where he and Reddick met bassist Erik Chandler and drummer Gary Wiseman in the early 1990s (although Wiseman did not join the band until 1998).

Burney and Chandler soon formed the Folkadots, while Wiseman formed Gary &amp; the Wiseman. Burney and Chandler, along with Morrill, also formed the band Slaw. Around this time, Reddick formed the band Terminal Seasons. Not too long after, Reddick and Morrill formed coolfork! which Burney later joined. The band was in full swing by 1993, playing such venues as the Refuge. A few months later, after forming a band called Rubberneck, the group changed their name to Bowling for Soup, which was derived from a comedy act by Steve Martin, and the band was officially formed in Wichita Falls on June 4, 1994, by Reddick (lead vocals, guitar), Burney (guitar, backing vocals), Chandler (bass, backing vocals, acoustic guitar), and Morrill (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Morrill left the band on good terms and was replaced in July 1998 by Wiseman.

In 1996, Bowling for Soup relocated to Denton, Texas, and in 1998 recorded their second studio album (and third overall), &quot;Rock on Honorable Ones!!&quot; for the Denton music label FFROE. The group released its first EP, &quot;Tell Me When to Whoa&quot;, through FFROE later that year. The album sold over 10,000 copies, prompting Jive Records to sign the band. As a side project, beginning around 1999 until May 2018, Reddick and Chandler performed acoustic shows at smaller venues and showcases, playing primarily Bowling for Soup songs in an acoustic fashion, billed as Jaret &amp; Erik. Beginning in September 2017, Reddick began performing solo acoustic shows, starting with the Heartache &amp; Hilarity tour in the UK.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Do It for Johnny!!&quot;, Bowling for Soup&#x27;s major label debut, was released on Jive in 2000. The album mostly contained re-recordings of the group&#x27;s previous material along with a few new tracks and a cover of Bryan Adams&#x27; song &quot;Summer of &#x27;69&quot;. &quot;Drunk Enough to Dance&quot; is Bowling for Soup&#x27;s second album with Jive Records, released August 6, 2002. It was recorded at Tree Sound Studios and Sonica Recording in Atlanta and Big Time Audio in Dallas. One of the album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Girl All The Bad Guys Want&quot; (the other single was &quot;Emily&quot;), was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2003 in the &quot;Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal&quot; category. Reddick considers the Grammies one of his shining moments, not for the nomination, but for winning &quot;worst dressed&quot; from Joan Rivers.

A re-release in 2003 added &quot;Punk Rock 101&quot;, a cover of the 1980s new wave band A Flock of Seagulls&#x27; &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot;, and &quot;Star Song&quot;. An acoustic version of the song &quot;Belgium&quot; exists at the end of the album, as well as at the very end of the initial release. The cover of &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; was used as the opening theme song of the anime television show &quot;Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac&quot; in North America.

The band appeared in the 2002 film &quot;Crossroads&quot;, playing at a graduation party.

&quot;A Hangover You Don&#x27;t Deserve&quot; followed two years later, and has become the band&#x27;s only Top 40 album. Sales of the album were driven in large part by the radio airplay of the single &quot;1985&quot;, a song written by Mitch Allan of SR-71 and covered by Bowling For Soup with his permission. Bowling for Soup did make some modifications to the lyrics to better fit their style with Mitch Allan, lead vocalist of SR-71, contributed backing vocals to the song and appeared in the music video. &quot;1985&quot; became Bowling for Soup&#x27;s biggest hit in the U.S., reaching No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A second single from &quot;A Hangover You Don&#x27;t Deserve&quot;, &quot;Almost&quot;, charted on the UK Singles Chart, No. 46 on the U.S. Top 100, and No. 23 on U.S. Pop 100. &quot;Ohio&quot;, better known as &quot;Come Back to Texas&quot;, was released as a radio single in the U.S., but was not as popular as &quot;1985&quot; or &quot;Almost&quot;, reaching only No. 59 on the U.S. Pop 100.

====&quot;Bowling for Soup Goes to the Movies&quot; and &quot;The Great Burrito Extortion Case&quot;====

&quot;Bowling for Soup Goes to the Movies&quot;, a compilation album of cover songs and contributions to movie soundtracks, was released by the band in 2005. Later that year, Reddick and Burney made several appearances on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;90s: Part Deux&quot;. Bowling for Soup appeared briefly at the start of the 2005 film &quot;Cursed&quot;, playing the song &quot;Li&#x27;l Red Riding Hood&quot;.

The group went on the &quot;Star 102.1 StarJam&quot; tour with Simple Plan in 2006 and were the opening act, performing &quot;Almost&quot;, &quot;Trucker Hat&quot;, &quot;Girl All the Bad Guys Want&quot;, &quot;1985&quot;, &quot;Punk Rock 101&quot;, &quot;I Melt With You&quot;, and more. The group&#x27;s cover version of Modern English&#x27;s &quot;I Melt With You&quot; was used in the Disney movie &quot;Sky High&quot; and was on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. A music video of the song was made for the movie, aired on the Disney Channel and can be found on the movie&#x27;s DVD. Once more Bowling for Soup was at StarJams 2007 with Quietdrive and Army of Freshmen.

Following the release of the band&#x27;s covers album, Bowling for Soup spent most of 2006 readying &quot;The Great Burrito Extortion Case&quot;, the group&#x27;s seventh album, which was released on November 7, 2006. The group released the first single from that album, &quot;High School Never Ends&quot;, to iTunes on September 19, 2006. The UK release of the album was on February 5, 2007.

In 2006, the band embarked on The Get Happy Tour, which was set up as a joint venture with alongside Army of Freshmen. The original tour was planned with Bowling for Soup headlining, Army of Freshmen opening and two other bands (Punchline and Lucky Boys Confusion) playing between. The tour kicked off in Austin, Texas on June 23, 2006, with the Vanished taking Lucky Boys Confusion&#x27;s spot for the first three dates. The band toured the U.S. over the summer and autumn of 2006 with the Get Happy Tour and ended on August 27, 2006, in Amarillo, Tex. This was followed by a UK tour in early February 2007. Coinciding with this UK tour was the UK release of &quot;High School Never Ends&quot;. The tour included Bowling for Soup as main headliners, Wheatus, Son of Dork and Army of Freshmen on the 12 date trek, which concluded at Hammersmith Palais in London, on the February 18.

The band released &quot;I&#x27;m Gay&quot; as the second UK single in early 2007. The release was on CD and 7&quot; vinyl. A music video for the single was released in the UK, made up of live performances of the song from the &quot;Get Happy Tour&quot;, of which the band had performed in the UK during February 2007. On September 25, 2007, it was announced on the official Bowling for Soup forums that &quot;When We Die&quot; would be released as a download only single in the UK on October 22, 2007, as the third single. Following this, the music video was added to the Kerrang television playlist and was played on Scuzz TV.
The group created an album (also on the label Jive) called &quot;On Your Mark... Get Set... Smoke a Cigarette&quot; which consisted of three songs: &quot;Bipolar&quot;, &quot;Somebody Get My Mom&quot;, &quot;Li&#x27;l Red Riding Hood&quot;.

Bowling for Soup confirmed during the Get Happy Tour that the group would be performing another tour of the UK in October 2007, called the Get Happy Tour 2, gracing the U.S. over the summer and featuring support acts Melee, Quietdrive, and Army of Freshmen. The UK tour bands were confirmed at the Download Festival (Army of Freshmen who played in the morning announced it first, and Bowling for Soup announced it later that afternoon), along with the lineup in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; on an advertisement poster for the new tour. The lineup consisted of Bowling for Soup, Bloodhound Gang, Zebrahead and Army of Freshmen.

====DirecTV, Download Festival 2007, and live album====

Bowling for Soup produced an hour-long special that airs on DirecTV&#x27;s concert series and made an appearance at the Download Festival at Donington Park, England. Bowling for Soup cowrote and sang the theme song for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, &quot;Today Is Gonna Be A Great Day&quot;. The group briefly appears in one episode of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, called &quot;Phineas and Ferb&#x27;s Quantum Boogaloo&quot;. &quot;Greatest Day&quot; was the opening song to the Nickelodeon film &quot;The Last Day of Summer&quot;.

The band&#x27;s first live DVD, &quot;Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive&quot; was filmed over the course of the UK Get Happy Tour October 2007 and premiered at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival with the DVD released in the summer. A three-disk edition was released in the UK on July 7, 2008. There was a limited edition pre-order deal for the DVD which included a T-shirt, drinks mug, exclusive poster and more besides the DVD. Reddick sang lead vocals and Chandler sang backing vocals for the song &quot;Endless Possibility&quot; for the video game &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;.

====&quot;Sorry for Partyin″&quot; and other releases====
On January 20, 2009, Reddick released a video onto the web via the band&#x27;s Myspace page and both YouTube accounts about a new album by the group. According to him, the band&#x27;s eighth full-length album was set to be released in September 2009, and the band had very recently started recording. He said it was to be titled &quot;Sorry for Partyin″&quot;. The video was the first of a few released during the recording process of the album.

&quot;Sorry for Partyin″&quot; was released on October 12, 2009. &quot;My Wena&quot; was the first promotional single from the album. The single was first previewed on May 5, 2009, on the &quot;Lex and Terry show&quot;. A music video for the song was filmed and the video was released on July 21, 2009. The song was released to iTunes on July 28, 2009. &quot;No Hablo Ingles&quot; was supposed to be the first single released to the radio for the album, however, Jive split with the band and shelved &quot;Sorry for Partyin″&quot; after only four weeks of being on sale, thus no single was ever released to radio.

To promote the release of the album, the band embarked on a headline tour of the UK in October 2009 under the title of The Party in Your Pants Tour. Main support on the tour came from Zebrahead, with additional support coming from MC Lars (who is signed to Reddick&#x27;s &quot;Crappy Records&quot;) and the Leftovers. During the last show of this tour at the Camden Town Roundhouse in London Reddick announced to the crowd that Bowling for Soup would return to the UK in &quot;The Spring&quot; and will be hitting the European summer festival circuit and then again returning to the UK for another headlining tour in the Autumn. On Christmas Eve 2009, Bowling for Soup announced through the band&#x27;s website, a UK Acoustic Tour in April 2010.

Bowling for Soup released &quot;Merry Flippin&#x27; Christmas Volume 1&quot; digitally on November 26, 2009.

====&quot;Fishin&#x27; for Woos&quot; and &quot;One Big Happy&quot;====

Bowling for Soup released an acoustic album, &quot;Jaret &amp; Erik 2010 UK Acoustic Tour Limited Edition CD&quot;, during Reddick and Chandler&#x27;s acoustic tour in the UK in April 2010. The album was released after the tour on the band&#x27;s online UK and US stores. Reddick has also stated that an acoustic album is very possible for the group&#x27;s next acoustic tour, which was planned for April 2011, but nothing came of it.

The band played at four US Navy Bases in 2011, three in Japan: Sasebo on July 2, Yokosuka on July 4 and Okinawa on July 13. Diego Garcia NSF in British Indian Ocean Territory was part of the Armed Forces Entertainment tour for the band, to help kick off July 4 Celebrations for the troops. The first three dates were part of the Independence Day Celebration. During February and March 2012 Reddick &amp; Chandler also traveled to the Middle East and Africa to perform some acoustic shows at US Military bases throughout the region.

In an interview, Reddick said that after the band&#x27;s current tour concluded he would begin writing material for a new record. Reddick confirmed May 8 on his Twitter account the band would start recording an eleventh album in June 2010. On June 2, an update was posted on the band&#x27;s website stating that the group had entered the studio and begun recording the album.

The album was ultimately released April 25, 2011, in the United Kingdom, and April 26 worldwide. In July 2011, the band released a 7&quot; split EP with the Dollyrots, in which each band covered one of the other band&#x27;s songs. Reddick said the band had plans to release a lot of other music in 2011: &quot;We are re-releasing our first 3 albums and working on another Christmas album. Chandler will release a solo record. And my new band, People on Vacation, will release our first album. We are also trying to get a b-sides comp together. It is gonna be a great year!&quot;. In October 2011, Bowling for Soup released a three-track single that included the new single &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Done Anything Like This&quot;, which features Kay Hanley on vocals from &quot;Fishin&#x27; for Woos&quot;, as well as a re-recorded version of &quot;The Bitch Song&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; by Fountains of Wayne.

On September 8, the band performed at the Tennessee Soybean Festival in Martin, Tennessee. On September 25, the band released a split album with the Dollyrots and Patent Pending called &quot;One Big Happy&quot;, where the bands perform covers of each other&#x27;s songs.

====&quot;Lunch. Drunk. Love.&quot; and &quot;Songs People Actually Liked Vol. 1&quot;====

On February 15, 2013, the band started a pledge music campaign to fund a new album, and Reddick stated: &quot;The Writing Process has Begun&quot;. Pledgers got to hear the songs just as they were finished. The first song to be written was &quot;Since We Broke Up&quot;, by Linus of Hollywood and Reddick. On April 8, 2013, Bowling for Soup announced that the group&#x27;s last tour of the UK would take place in October of the same year, but they toured the UK again in February 2016, February 2018 and February 2020.

In an announcement video posted on the band&#x27;s official YouTube account, Reddick announced that the annual 14-day UK tour would go ahead in October 2013, but that it would be the last UK tour the group perform as Bowling for Soup. Reddick cited personal and financial reasons for the decision, saying that: &quot;The UK has given this band everything, so I&#x27;m being honest about our reasons. We still love being Bowling For Soup but touring really does begin to take its toll on both you and your family after a while.&quot; No Ireland dates were announced for the tour, which only featured one support act (Patent Pending) as opposed to two, with an extended Bowling for Soup setlist and exclusive acoustic concert for VIP ticket holders preceding the concert. The band also stressed that the group &quot;are not splitting up&quot;, but at the current time, there are no plans for a farewell US tour. Reddick also announced in a video posted online that the band was scheduled to record a new cover album, as well as a greatest hits album after the 2013 Farewell UK Tour and preceding the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary in June 2014.

On June 11, 2013, Reddick announced via the band&#x27;s PledgeMusic Project page it was up to the pledgers to vote on what the newest album should be named.

Love.&quot; The album was released to the pledgers on September 6, 2013, in both clean and explicit formats and the pledge campaign was temporarily extended, allowing effective purchase of the album for $10.

As part of Bowling for Soup&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Reddick, Burney, Chandler, and Wiseman decided to make a greatest hits album. The band once again turned to PledgeMusic to source funding for the project. The album is titled &quot;Songs People Actually Liked Volume 1 The First 10 Years&quot; and includes seventeen re-recorded songs and one new song. This album is seen by the band members as their true &#x27;Greatest Hits&#x27; (from the group&#x27;s first 10 years) as the previously released 2011 greatest hits album was released with no consultation from the band or fans. The album was released to PledgeMusic subscribers on November 19, 2014. One critic wrote, &quot;Bowling for Soup&#x27;s energetic, humorous music is just as good today as it was when it was released.&quot;

In 2015, Bowling for Soup appeared on Blues Traveler&#x27;s album &quot;Blow Up the Moon&quot;, co-writing the songs &quot;Right Here Waiting For You&quot; and &quot;I Know, Right&quot;.

The band announced on May 11, 2016, that they would begin to record a new EP, &quot;Drunk Dynasty&quot;. The band would again team up with PledgeMusic to include fans in the entire recording process. The band later announced that &quot;Drunk Dynasty&quot; was to be a full-length studio album. It was eventually released on October 14, 2016. 

In September 2017, the band announced that they would be returning to the UK the following February with a tour to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their seminal album &quot;Drunk Enough to Dance&quot;, accompanied by Get Happy Tour alumni Army of Freshmen (who celebrated their 20th anniversary as a band), and the Aquabats. The tour visited a number of large venues across the UK including O2 Apollo Manchester, University of East Anglia, culminating at London&#x27;s O2 Brixton Academy. A few months later, in March 2018, the band toured South Africa for the first time.

On January 12, 2019, Reddick took to the band&#x27;s official Facebook page to confirm fans&#x27; speculation that Chandler had left the band for personal reasons after not performing in some time. Chandler was replaced with long time friend, Rob Felicetti (Patent Pending/the Ataris). Later that year, in December 2019, the band released two volumes of&quot;A Nice Night For An Evening&quot;, featuring piano covers of their most popular songs.

=== 2020s ===

In February 2020, Bowling For Soup headlined the &quot;Together Again – You&#x27;re Welcome&quot; Tour in the UK, bringing along Simple Plan as direct support.

==Associations==

Bowling for Soup&#x27;s hit song &quot;1985&quot; was originally written by SR-71&#x27;s Mitch Allan. According to Reddick, Allan showed the song to him and instructed him to take it as his own, as it seemed more of a Bowling for Soup song than an SR-71 song. Bowling for Soup worked closely with the alternative band Army of Freshmen. In the video for &quot;High School Never Ends&quot; the boy clapping can be seen wearing an Army of Freshmen T-shirt, and Army of Freshmen themselves can be seen as part of the BFS Marching Band. Reddick does guest vocals on four tracks on Army of Freshmen&#x27;s album &quot;Under the Radar&quot;.

In 2003, fellow Texan punk rockers Junior opened for Bowling for Soup when the group played the club Trees in Deep Ellum. Reddick later co-wrote the song &quot;She&#x27;s So Amazing&quot; for the band&#x27;s album &quot;Are We Famous Yet?&quot;, and lends vocals as well. The Irish pop rock singer Lesley Roy lend her vocals for Bowling for Soup&#x27;s song &quot;Much More Beautiful Person&quot; from the album &quot;The Great Burrito Extortion Case&quot;. Both Roy and Bowling for Soup were assigned to the same record label. Reddick is friends with MC Lars, and has lent his vocals for MC Lars&#x27; single &quot;Download This Song&quot;. MC Lars was a part of Reddick&#x27;s label Crappy Records. In 2009, Bowling for Soup cameoed in the music video &quot;Telephone Operator&quot; by the Leftovers, who were also a part of Crappy Records.

In 2001, Bowling for Soup performed the theme song for the Nickelodeon film &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;. The group&#x27;s version of the theme was based on the previously written television series theme song written by Brian Causey of &quot;Man Or Astro-man?&quot;. Also in 2001, Reddick wrote the lyrics for &quot;Greatest Day&quot; for the film &quot;Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move&quot; while the band did the music. Bowling for Soup also performed the theme &quot;Today is Gonna Be a Great Day&quot; for the Disney Channel cartoon &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, Reddick stars in the episode &quot;Dude, We&#x27;re Getting the Band Back Together&quot; where he is the lead vocalist of a fictional band called &quot;Love Händel&quot;. The band itself also appeared in animated form in the episode &quot;Phineas and Ferb&#x27;s Quantum Boogaloo&quot; in which the band performed an alternate version of the show&#x27;s theme with Phineas and Ferb for their futuristic nephews. On Cartoon Network, Reddick and Chandler both played an acoustic show in 2006. And in August 2008 Reddick and Chandler filmed an exclusive video for &quot;Total Guitar&quot; magazine in the UK called &quot;How To Write A Song In 5 Minutes&quot;. In 2008, Reddick teamed up with SEGA to work on the theme song for &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;, titled &quot;Endless Possibility&quot;.

New Zealand band 48May ran into legal issues and decided to take the song &quot;Leather and Tattoos&quot; off of the group&#x27;s debut album, due to the melody sounding very similar to &quot;Punk Rock 101&quot;. The album was replaced with a &quot;tour edition&quot; of the CD with the questionable song missing.

In 2006, Bowling for Soup covered Fergie&#x27;s &quot;London Bridge&quot; for Pepsi Smash Cover Art on Yahoo! videos.

In 2008, Reddick co-arranged co-wrote and produced the singles &quot;SUV&quot; and &quot;Girls + Summer = Fun!&quot; with solo artist Christy Darlington, and Erik Chandler and Gary Wiseman performed on the recordings as well. These songs were subsequently released digitally. This collaboration resulted from Bowling for Soup and Darlington having performed concerts together and knowing each other since the late 1990s in the Dallas music scene and mutual respect and appreciation for each other&#x27;s music.

In 2014, Bowling for Soup covered the Green Day song &quot;St. Jimmy&quot; for the album &quot;Kerrang! Does Green Day&#x27;s American Idiot&quot;.

===Greenmount (2017)===

Lead vocalist Reddick provided vocals on the Lakesick track &quot;Greenmount&quot; as the theme song for the stoner adventure comedy of the same name. &quot;Greenmount&quot; stars Shane Kippel (star of &quot;&quot;) alongside creator Joshua Prior (who also fronts Lakesick), and John Donahue. &quot;Greenmount&quot; was released in June 2019.

==Music videos==
It became a running gag in Bowling for Soup&#x27;s music videos to feature previous songs of the band as an introduction for the video. This can be seen in &quot;Girl All the Bad Guys Want&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot;, and &quot;High School Never Ends&quot;, which feature music from &quot;The Bitch Song&quot;, &quot;Girl All the Bad Guys Want&quot;, and &quot;1985&quot; respectively.

<text>Woodenbong is a rural village in the Kyogle Shire of northern New South Wales. It is situated 10 km south of the Queensland border and five kilometres south of the junction of the Summerland Way and the Mount Lindesay Road, which leads to Legume and eventually Tenterfield. At the Woodenbong had a population of 390.

It is 798 km north-east of Sydney, 145 km from Brisbane and 60 km north-west of Kyogle.

==Education==
Woodenbong is home to Woodenbong Central School, a Kindergarten – Year 12 central school, that serves as the common education centre for Woodenbong, as well as surrounding towns, Urbenville and Muli Muli. Woodenbong Central School has played host on numerous occasions to sporting events held between other rural New South Wales towns.

==Name==
The name is derived from a Githabul word meaning wood ducks on a lagoon. The Githabal (also known as Gidabal, Kitabal) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries in Queensland of the Southern Downs Regional Council, particularly Warwick, Killarney, and Woodenbong extending into New South Wales.

==Agriculture==
Dairy farming and cattle grazing are the two main industries.

<text>Edward Daniel Clarke (5 June 17699 March 1822) was an English clergyman, naturalist, mineralogist, and traveller.

==Life==
Edward Daniel Clarke was born at Willingdon, Sussex, and educated first at Uckfield School and then at Tonbridge.

In 1786 he obtained the office of chapel clerk at Jesus College, Cambridge, but the loss of his father at this time involved him in difficulties. In 1790 he took his degree, and soon after became private tutor to Henry Tufton, nephew of the Duke of Dorset. In 1792 he obtained an engagement to travel with Lord Berwick through Germany, Switzerland and Italy. After crossing the Alps, and visiting a few of the principal cities of Italy, including Rome, he went to Naples, where he remained nearly two years. While in Naples, Clarke climbed Vesuvius on numerous occasions, to take guests to the summit and observe the state of activity of the volcano. He also constructed a model of Vesuvius, which Sir William Hamilton declared to be the &#x27;best ever produced&#x27;. This model was later transported to Lord Berwick&#x27;s seat at Attingham Park.

Having returned to England in the summer of 1794, he became a tutor to several distinguished families. In 1799 he set out with John Marten Cripps on a tour through the continent of Europe, beginning with Norway and Sweden, whence they proceeded through the Russian Empire—including Ukraine and Crimea—to Constantinople, Rhodes, and afterwards to Egypt and Palestine. After the capitulation of Alexandria, Clarke helped to secure for England a number of statues, sarcophagi, maps, manuscripts and other antiquities which had been collected by French savants in the city.

Greece was the next country they visited. From Athens, the travellers proceeded by land to Constantinople, and after a short stay in that city directed their course homewards through Rumelia, Austria, Germany and France. Clarke, who had now obtained considerable reputation, took up his residence at Cambridge. He received the degree of LL.D. shortly after his return in 1803, on account of the valuable donations, including a colossal statue of the Eleusinian Ceres, which he had made to the university.

He was also presented to the college living of Harlton, near Cambridge, in 1805. Four years later, his father-in-law added that of Yeldham, Essex. Towards the end of 1808 Clarke was appointed to the newly created Professorship of mineralogy in Cambridge. His perseverance as a traveller and collector was also rewarded financially: the manuscripts which he had collected in the course of his travels, among them the celebrated Clarke Codex of Plato&#x27;s dialogues (895 CE), were sold to the Bodleian Library for £1000; and by the publication of his travels he realized altogether a clear profit of £6595.

Besides lecturing on mineralogy and discharging his clerical duties, made several discoveries in chemistry, principally by means of the gas blow-pipe, which he had brought to a high degree of perfection. He was also appointed university librarian in 1817, and was one of the founders of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1819. He died in London on 9 March 1822.

== Greek artefacts ==

In 1801, Clarke and his assistant John Marten Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens for the removal of a statue of the goddess Demeter at Eleusis, with the intervention of Italian artist Giovanni Battista Lusieri who was Elgin&#x27;s assistant at the time. The statue had been discovered in 1676 by the traveller George Wheler, and several ambassadors had submitted unsuccessful applications for its removal. Clarke was the one to remove the statue by force, after bribing the &quot;waiwode&quot; of Athens and obtaining an edict, despite the objections of the local population who unofficially, and against the traditions of the iconoclastic Church, worshipped the statue as the uncanonised Saint Demetra (Greek: Αγία Δήμητρα).

The people would adorn the statue with garlands, and believed that the goddess was able to bring fertility to their fields and that the removal of the statue would cause that benefit to disappear. Clarke also removed other marbles from Greece including a statue of Pan, a figure of Eros, a comic mask and various reliefs and funerary steles. Clarke donated these to the University of Cambridge and in 1803 the statue of Demeter was displayed at the university library. The collection was later moved to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge where it formed one of the two main collections of the institution.

<doc id="937316" wikidata="Q5161122" url="?curid=937316" title="Conistorgis">
<text>Conistorgis was the main city of the Conii or Cynetes. In the Conii language it probably meant &quot;city of the Conii&quot;. The Celtici seem to have been present there.

== Location ==
Conistorgis was located somewhere in the interior of the Algarve, in southernmost Portugal, although the exact location is unknown.

Strabo places the land of the Conii between the river Anas and Hieron Akroterion (sacred promontory), with the latter being the most extreme point of the known world. He places Conistorgis in Celtic territory. In 1990, the most likely location was considered to be Baixo Alentejo or Algarve, northeast of Serra do Caldeirão.

Some attempts have been made to identify Conistorgis with later, Roman sites. One suggestion is that Conistorgis would have been located in Beja, one of the few Portuguese cities not to have a preroman name. This hypothesis would interpret the name Conistorgis as having a Celtic origin and meaning waterless () hill () and that Julius Caesar would later rename Pax Julia. Another hypothesis is that Conistorgis would correspond to Medellín, Spain. None of these two suggestions are consensual among experts.

== History ==
The Conii had made an alliance with the Romans during the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.

Appian mentions the city twice: once, between 155 and 152 BC, when the city is raided by the Lusitanians, led by Caucenus, during the Lusitanian War against Rome. The second time is when Servius Sulpicius Galba retreats into the city around 150 BC, after his first battle against the Lusitanians. Thus, the city was reconquered between 155 BC and 150 BC, probably by Marcus Atilius, when he fights against the Lusitanians and Vettones.

During the Sertorian War, Conistorgis is again attacked. The Sertorian forces attack the Roman forces garrisoned in Conistorgis.

<text>The English River is a river in Kenora District and Thunder Bay District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. It flows through Lac Seul to join the Winnipeg River at Tetu Lake as a right tributary. The river is in the Hudson Bay drainage basin, is long and has a drainage basin of . Although there are several hydroelectric plants on this river, the English River upstream of Minnitaki Lake is notable as one of the few large river systems in northwestern Ontario with a natural flow and without any upstream source of pollution. It is the fourth longest river entirely in Ontario.

There is also a settlement on the river called English River, located where Highway 17 crosses the river at its confluence with the Scotch River, along with a nearby railway point of the same name, constructed as part of the Canadian Pacific Railway transcontinental main line.

2 non-contiguous segments of the river are protected in 2 separate provincial parks: the East English River Provincial Park and West English River Provincial Park.

==Geography==
The English River forms in Thunder Bay District, just east of English River settlement on the boundary with Kenora District. Flowing north straddling the district boundary until Mattawa Lake, it continues northwest through Minnitaki Lake and passes Sioux Lookout, the largest town along its course. Through Lac Seul, it flows to its mouth at Tetu Lake on the Winnipeg River, which flows via the Nelson River to Hudson Bay. It flows through numerous lakes during its course.

The Frog Rapids are located at Frog Rapids Narrows (), a short narrows on the English River near Sioux Lookout between Abram Lake and Pelican Lake. The narrows, where Highway 72 across the English River, is formed by two peninsulas between the lakes.

===Tributaries===
*Vermilion River
*Wabigoon River

===Settlements===
Settlements along its course are (in upstream order):
*Caribou Falls
*Ear Falls
*Kejick Bay / Lac Seul First Nation
*Sioux Lookout
*English River

==Fauna==
The English River is considered as one of the best fisheries in Ontario. Notable trophy fish species include walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and muskellunge. At least 21 fish species have been identified, including sauger, yellow perch, rock bass, cisco, lake whitefish, and mooneye.

==Hydroelectricity==

There are 4 hydro-electric generating stations on the English River, owned and operated by Ontario Power Generation.

<text>Prof William Hallowes Miller FRS HFRSE LLD DCL (6 April 180120 May 1880) was a Welsh mineralogist and laid the foundations of modern crystallography.

Miller indices are named after him, the method having been described in his &quot;Treatise on Crystallography&quot; (1839). The mineral known as millerite is named after him.

== Life and work ==

Miller was born in 1801 at Velindre near Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, South Wales. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1826 as fifth wrangler. He became a Fellow there in 1829. For a few years Miller was occupied as a college tutor and during this time he published treatises on hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.

Miller also gave special attention to crystallography, and at 31 years old, on the resignation of William Whewell he succeeded in 1832 to the professorship of mineralogy, a post he held until 1870. Miller&#x27;s chief work, on &quot;Crystallography&quot;, was published in 1839. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1838 and received the Royal Medal in 1870, and in the same year was appointed on the &quot;International Commission du Metre&quot;. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1874.

Miller was the main thrust in reforming the Parliamentary standards of length and weight, after a fire which in 1834 destroyed the old standards. He was a member of the committee as well as on the Royal Commission which oversaw these new standards.

Miller died in 1880 in Cambridge, England.

==Family==

In 1844 he married Harriet Susan Minty.

<doc id="937321" wikidata="Q7295620" url="?curid=937321" title="Rathdowney, Queensland">
<text>Rathdowney (historically also written as Rathdownie) is a rural town and locality in the Scenic Rim Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Rathdowney had a population of 320 people.
== Geography ==
Rathdowney is on the Mount Lindesay Highway south of Beaudesert at the base of the McPherson Range.

The eastern boundary is marked by the Logan River. It is also close to some of the areas of greatest biodiversity in Australia, and a gateway to various National Parks such as Border Ranges National Park and Mount Barney National Park with a variety of lush rainforest, eucalypt forest, mountain heath and other habitats.

The former locality of Bigriggan (also spelled Bigriggen) is within Rathdowney, west of the town (). It is accessed via Bigriggan Road which terminates at the Bigriggan Reserve Park, located near the confluence of Burnett Creek and the Logan River. The park provides camp sites with a kiosk by the river with access available to caravans, motorhomes and buses.

== History ==
Mununjali (also known as Mananjahli, Manaldjahli and Manandjali) is a dialect of the Yugambeh language. The Mununjali language area includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Scenic Rim and Beaudesert Shire Councils.

The first European exploration of the area was by Patrick Logan, commandant of the Moreton Bay penal colony, in 1828. The area became available for settlement in 1842. Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior purchased a large freehold estate in 1876, which he named Rathdowney Station after the Murray-Prior estates in Rathdowney, Ireland.

The town was named after the former Rathdowney pastoral station.

Timber clearing was the first major industry in the area. Cattle grazing and dairy farming are now the main industries.

Bigriggan Provisional School opened in November 1892. There were a number of temporary closures due to low student numbers before it closed in 1906. It re-opened in 1910 as Bigriggan State School but closed permanently on 25 April 1912.

Rathdownie Provisional School opened on 10 February 1908. On 1 January 1909 it became Rathdownie State School. In 1914 the name was changed to Cashell&#x27;s Hill State School. It closed in 1924.

Enright&#x27;s General Store opened in 1909. It operated until 1971. It is commemorated by a plaque.The Beaudesert Shire Tramway was extended to Rathdowney in 1911, but closed in 1944.

Rathdowney Terminus State School opened on 14 May 1912; the school&#x27;s name presumably refers to the terminus of the tramway. In 1915 it was renamed Rathdowney State School.

In April 1928, 116 subdivided allotments of &quot;Telemon Estate, Beaudesert&quot; were auctioned by Isles, Love &amp; Co. and in conjunction with M. Selwyn Smith &amp; Son Auctioneers. 25 dairy and agricultural farms, 72 township allotments and 19 farmlets from the estate of Chris J. Collins were available. According to the map advertising the auction, the estate was 17 miles from Beaudesert and 64 miles from Brisbane.

The foundations for St David&#x27;s Anglican Church were laid on Saturday 9 March 1929. The church was opened and dedicated on Saturday 13 July 1929 by Bishop Henry Le Fanu.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church was opened on 29 September 1929 by Archbishop James Duhig. Prior to this, Catholic services were held in the Rathdowney Memorial Hall and the Rathdowney School of Arts.

In 1957, Palen Creek Methodist Church was relocated to 39 Running Creek Road () in Rathdowney. In the 1970s, it was further extended with the Glenapp hall and the Barney View Lutheran Church. When the Methodist Church became part of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, it became the Palen Creek Uniting Church. It held its last service on Sunday 23 February 2014. It is now in private ownership.

<text>Ganzhou (), alternately romanized as Kanchow, is a prefecture-level city in the south of Jiangxi province, China, bordering Fujian to the east, Guangdong to the south, and Hunan to the west. Its administrative seat is at Zhanggong District.

==History==

=== Early settlement and administration ===
In 201 CE, Emperor Gaozu of Han established a county in the territory of modern Ganzhou. In 236 CE, during the Three Kingdoms period, the was established in the area. In the early years, Han Chinese settlement and authority in the area was minimal and largely restricted to the Gan River basin. The river, a tributary of the Yangtze via Poyang Lake, provided a route of communication from the north as well as irrigation for rice farming.

=== Sui dynasty ===
In 589 CE, during the Sui dynasty, the was abolished, and the area was reorganized as Qianzhou. During the Song, immigration from the north bolstered the local population and drove local aboriginal tribes into admixing with the northerners. After the fall of the capital to the Jin in 1126 in the Jingkang Incident, immigration increased dramatically.

=== Song dynasty ===
In 1153, under the Southern Song, Qianzhou was abolished, and re-organized as Ganzhou, the same name as the present-day city.

=== Yuan dynasty ===
In 1277, under the Yuan dynasty, the area was reorganized as . Near the end of the Yuan dynasty, in 1365, Ganzhou Circuit was reorganized again as , which it remained until 1912.

=== Qing dynasty ===
During the late 1800s Ganzhou was opened as one of the southern treaty ports and became a minor base for foreign companies.

=== Republic of China ===
In 1912, the Republic of China abolished the area&#x27;s dynasty-era subdivisions, replacing them all with counties administered by the provincial government of Jiangxi. In 1914, the province of Jiangxi was divided into four circuits (), one of which being , which ruled the area of present-day Ganzhou. In 1926, Gannan Circuit was abolished, and its counties were again directly administered by the Jiangxi provincial government. In 1932, the province established , and the area of present-day Ganzhou was split between the 9th, 11th, 12th, and 13th Administrative Inspectorates. In subsequent years, the area would be reorganized to be divided between various Administrative Inspectorates.

==== Chinese Soviet Republic ====
Beginning in 1928, the Chinese Communist Party began operating in the area, and by June 1930, a local soviet had formed and began governing a number of counties in the region. In November 1931, the Chinese Soviet Republic was proclaimed in , in the then-county of Ruijin. During the subsequent years, Ganzhou was governed by the Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet. Beginning in February 1934, Communist Party forces in the area began to lose territory to Kuomintang forces (Fifth encirclement). From then until March 1935, the Soviet gradually lost territory with only five northeastern counties left in Ganzhou as of early October 1934 until it collapsed.

==== Gannan New Deal ====
Between 1939 and 1945, Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek, was appointed by the Government of the Republic of China as commissioner of Ganzhou Prefecture (mountain South), then the name of the surrounding regions of Ganzhou. There he banned opium smoking, gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. His efforts were hailed as a miracle in the political war in China, then coined as the &quot;Gannan New Deal&quot; (). During his time in Gannan, from 1940 he implemented a &quot;public information desk&quot; where ordinary people could visit him if they had problems, and according to records, Chiang Ching-kuo received a total of 1,023 people during such sessions in 1942. In regards to the ban on prostitution and closing of brothels, Chiang implemented a policy where former prostitutes became employed in factories. Due to the large number of refugees in Ganzhou as a result from the ongoing war, thousands of orphans lived on the street; in June 1942, Chiang Ching-kuo formally established the Chinese Children&#x27;s Village () in the outskirts of Ganzhou, with facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital and gymnasium.

<text>Henry Clifton Sorby (10 May 1826 – 9 March 1908) was an English amateur microscopist and geologist. His major contribution was the development of techniques for thin sectioning of rocks and minerals with polarized light under a microscope which was also extended to study iron and steel, his family having been involved in the Sheffield iron and steel industry for generations. He also contributed to the study of meteorites by introducing a method of blowpipe analysis where molten beads were flattened for microscopic study. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1857.
==Biography==
===Early life===
Sorby was born at Woodbourne, near Sheffield in Yorkshire, to Henry Sorby (1790-1846) and Amelia (d. 1872). His father Henry was one of twelve children of John Sorby (1775-1829) of Spital Hill, Sheffield and Elizabeth Swallow (1761-1829) of Attercliffe Forge, Sheffield. The family had a business in iron production from the early 17th century. An older sister of his father Henry, Anne had married Henry Hartop, a Sheffield steel industry manager. He had built Woodbourn House where Sorby&#x27;s father and lived from 1822. While another uncle John Francis married Hartop&#x27;s daughter Amelia, yet another, Alfred married Amelia&#x27;s sister Ann Lambert. The family was thus deeply connected in the Sheffield industry. They also owned land at the Orgreave Hall Estate where there were coal seams and sandstone quarries. Sorby attended Sheffield Collegiate School leaving it in 1841. He early on developed an interest in natural science through the influence of his father who had an interest in geology, as well as the private tutor Rev. Walter Mitchell who had graduated from Cambridge. He also studied German around 1845, possibly under William Fochlander and this would allow Sorby to study the work of Justus von Liebig. One of his first papers related to the excavation of valleys in Yorkshire. In 1847, when he was 21, his father died, leaving him a comfortable private income. He immediately established a scientific laboratory and workshop at his home. 

===Petrography===
Sorby had an interest in geology and was involved in the Geological and Polytechnic Society between 1845 and 1846. He subsequently dealt with the physical geography of former geological periods, with the wave-structure in certain stratified rocks, and the origin of slaty cleavage.

Sorby began to produce thin slices of hard rocks based on the methods used in zoology that he had learned from professor William Crawford Williamson. He also began to use polarized light to examine the thin transparent sections of rocks. He took up the study of rocks and minerals under the microscope, and published an important memoir, &quot;On the Microscopical Structure of Crystals&quot;, in 1858 (&quot;Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.&quot;). He then introduced spectrographic analysis techniques. In England, he was one of the pioneers in petrography; he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London in 1869, and became its president. In his presidential addresses, Sorby gave the results of original research on the structure and origin of limestones and of non-calcareous stratified rocks (1879–1880).

In the mid-Victorian years, Sorby was also the first to study the cleavage of slates using a microscope. In the frame of an ardent debate on the origin and mechanism of the slatey cleavage with the Irish physicist John Tyndall, who was also a pioneering mountain climber (Tyndall&#x27;s name is also associated with the &quot;Golden age of alpinism&quot;) and visited the Alps mountains in 1856 for scientific reasons, Sorby devised a quote now famous: 
: &quot;Mountains must indeed be examined with the microscope&quot;.

Sorby was one of the first to understand the role and the importance of microscopic processes to explain material deformation and large scale phenomena such as rock cleavage and rock folding caused by tectonic uplift and orogeny.

He studied the microscopical structure of meteorites.

In the summer of 1876 at South Kensington, he gave a lecture to science teachers on microscopes.

===Metallography===
In 1863, he used etching with acid to study the microscopic structure of iron and steel. Using this technique, he was the first in England to understand that a small but precise quantity of carbon gave steel its strength. His metallographic observations allowed to scientifically confirm the merits and the soundness of the process patented by Henry Bessemer in 1855, and improved by Robert Forester Mushet in 1856, for mass-production of steel. Due to this accomplishment, Sorby is known to modern metallurgists as the &quot;father of metallography&quot;, with an award bearing his name being offered by the International Metallographic Society for lifetime achievement.

===Marine sciences===
His interests were broad. After buying a yacht, &quot;The Glimpse&quot;, he also studied sedimentology and marine biology. Sorby examined ripples in sedimentary rocks and examined their orientations in different layers thus pioneering the study of paleocurrents. He also measured the temperature of the water in estuaries. He published essays on the construction and use of the micro-spectroscope in the study of matter colouring marine animals and vegetable. He also applied his skill in making preparations of marine invertebrate animals for lantern slides. Furthermore, he once estimated &quot;one cubic thousandth of an inch of water to contain molecules.&quot;

===Fellow of scientific societies===
In 1857, aged only 31, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in recognition of this work on slaty cleavage.

He was president of the Royal Microscopical Society. In 1882, he was elected president of Firth College, Sheffield after the death of founder Mark Firth. Sorby also worked hard for the establishment of the University of Sheffield, which was eventually founded in 1905. A university hall of residence, Sorby Hall, built in the 1960s and demolished in August 2006, was named after him.

===Death===
He died in Sheffield and was buried in Ecclesall churchyard.

==Honours and awards==

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1857 as one who was &quot;Author of various papers on Slaty Cleavage; on the peculiarities of stratification due to the action of currents &amp; their application to the investigation of the Physical Geography of ancient periods; on the microscopical structure of limestones and other peculiarities of the physical &amp; chemical constitution of rocks. Distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Geology&quot;. He delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1863 for his work &quot;on the Direct Correlation of mechanical and Chemical Forces&quot; and was awarded their Royal Medal in 1874. In 1892, Sorby was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Both the International Association of Sedimentologists and the Yorkshire Geological Society have Sorby Medals named in honour of his achievements in geology. The Henry Clifton Sorby Award is offered by the International Metallographic Society in recognition of lifetime achievement in metallurgy. The University of Sheffield has a chair of geology/physical geology named after him and the Sorby Natural History Society is named after Sorby. The area in which the society operates (north East Derbyshire, the Sheffield and Chesterfield areas) are known to members as &#x27;Sorbyshire&#x27;.

The Dorsa Sorby wrinkle ridge system on the Moon is named after him. There is also a wing at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield (South Yorkshire) named after him.

<text>Castle Acre Priory was a Cluniac priory in the village of Castle Acre, Norfolk, England, dedicated to St Mary, St Peter, and St Paul. It is thought to have been founded in 1089 by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (the son of the 1st Earl of Surrey who had founded England&#x27;s first Cluniac priory at Lewes in 1077). The order originated from Burgundy. Originally the priory was sited within the walls of Castle Acre Castle, but this proved too small and inconvenient for the monks; hence, the priory was relocated to the present site in the castle grounds about one year later.

The priory was dissolved in 1537, and its ruins are in the care of English Heritage, along with the nearby Castle Acre Bailey Gate and Castle Acre Castle.

==Description==
The church itself was consecrated sometime between 1146 and 1148. While the Warenne family may have been the main benefactors of the priory, others also gave generously to it, for example Scolland of Bedale, steward of Alan Earl of Richmond, who was in fact buried there. Like other Cluniac houses, Castle Acre Priory was directly subject to the authority of the Abbot of Cluny; for practical reasons, however, the Prior of Lewes was usually instructed to act for the abbot when any problems arose at Castle Acre. However, this obedience owed to a foreign abbot caused difficulties when the kings of England were at odds with France and/or Burgundy. In the mid 14th century the English Cluniacs settled this difficulty by buying a special legal recognition from the king as &#x27;native&#x27; religious houses. The priory was home to some 20 to 30 monks.

The nave of the church is one of the oldest parts of the ruin. Subsequent additions continued to be added until the priory was dissolved in 1537 under Henry VIII, and when the King gave the dissolved priory to the Duke of Norfolk complete with its estates, the remaining monks were turned out.

The estates eventually passed to Sir Edward Coke, whose descendant, the Earl of Leicester now owns the ruins and Castle Acre Castle.

The ruins today are very impressive, the great west front of the building is almost complete, and the prior&#x27;s lodging is in a similar condition.

==Media appearances==
Scenes throughout &quot;The Tomb of Ligeia&quot; classic horror movie (1964, directed by Roger Corman, starring Vincent Price), were shot at Castle Acre Priory ruins.

The priory was also used in the award-winning Children&#x27;s TV Show &quot;Knightmare&quot; as &quot;The Ruins of Dungarth&quot;. It also features prominently in the film &quot;Glorious 39&quot;.

<text>Protopterus is the genus of four species of lungfish found in Africa. &quot;Protopterus&quot; is considered the sole genus in the family Protopteridae, which is grouped with &quot;Lepidosiren&quot; in the order Lepidosireniformes.

== Taxonomy ==
The earliest fossils of the Protopteridae come from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian) of Sudan, but phylogenetic evidence indicates that it and Lepidosirenidae split at the very beginning of the Early Cretaceous, around 145 Ma. Together, their common ancestor diverged from the only other extant lungfishes in Neoceratodontidae during the Late Jurassic.

Some papers suggest grouping &quot;Protopterus&quot; and &quot;Lepidosiren&quot; together in the family Lepidosirenidae, as their Cretaceous divergence is relatively recent compared to the Carboniferous origins of other lungfish families. However, most taxonomic authorities retain them as distinct families.

==Description==
African lungfish are elongated, eel-like fishes with thread-like pectoral and pelvic fins. They have soft scales, and the dorsal and tail fins are fused into a single structure. They can either swim like eels or crawl along the bottom using their pectoral and pelvic fins. The largest species can reach about in length.

African lungfish generally inhabit shallow waters, such as swamps and marshes. They are also found in larger lakes such as Lake Victoria. They can survive out of water for many months by burrowing into hardened mud beneath a dried stream bed. They are carnivorous, feeding on crustaceans, aquatic insect larvae, and molluscs.

==Biology==

The African lungfish is an example of how the evolutionary transition from breathing water to breathing air can occur. Lungfish are periodically exposed to water with low oxygen content or encounter situations in which their aquatic environment dries up. To cope with these conditions, they have developed an adaptation in the form of an outpocketing of the gut, similar to the swim bladder found in other fishes. This specialized structure functions as a lung. Within the lung, numerous thin-walled blood vessels allow the blood to absorb oxygen from the air that is gulped into the lung.

They are obligate air breathers, with reduced gills in the adults. There are two anterior gill arches that retain gills, though they are too small to function as the sole respiratory apparatus, and may be more important for carbon dioxide elimination. About 90% of their oxygen is acquired via their lungs, and the remaining ~10% via the gills and skin. The lungfish heart has adaptations that partially separate the flow of blood into its pulmonary and systemic circuits. The atrium is partially divided, so that the left side receives oxygenated blood and the right side receives deoxygenated blood from the other tissues. These two blood streams remain mostly separate as they flow through the ventricle leading to the gill arches. As a result, oxygenated blood mostly goes to the anterior gill arches and the deoxygenated blood mostly goes to the posterior arches.

African lungfishes breed at the beginning of the rainy season. They construct nests or burrows in the mud to hold their eggs, which they then guard against predators. When they hatch, the young resemble tadpoles, with external gills, and only later develop lungs and begin to breathe air.

==As food==
Until the introduction of the Nile perch to the region, lungfish typically comprised a small proportion of a fisherman&#x27;s catch. Transportation to market from catching sites in Lake Victoria was often done with fish sun-dried for better preservation. Human consumption of the lungfish varies by population; the Luo peoples occasionally do so but the Sukuma avoid eating lungfish due to a taste which is &quot;locally either highly appreciated or strongly disliked.&quot; As technology advancements such as longlines and gillnets have been increasingly applied over the past 50 years, the lungfish populations there are believed to be decreasing.

==Species and subspecies==
The family Protopteridae and genus &quot;Protopterus&quot; contain four extant (living) species:
* &quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot; — marbled lungfish
** &quot;P. a. aethiopicus&quot; 
** &quot;P. a. congicus&quot; 
** &quot;P. a. mesmaekersi&quot; 
* &quot;Protopterus amphibius&quot; — gilled African lungfish or East African lungfish
* &quot;Protopterus annectens&quot; — West African lungfish
** &quot;P. a. annectens&quot; 
** &quot;P. a. brieni&quot; — southern lungfish
* &quot;Protopterus dolloi&quot; — slender lungfish or spotted African lungfish

Other extinct species are known from fossil remains:
* †&quot;Protopterus crassidens&quot; 
* †&quot;Protopterus elongus&quot; 
*†&quot;Protopterus libycus&quot; 
* †&quot;Protopterus nigeriensis&quot; 
* †&quot;Protopterus polli&quot; 
*†&quot;Protopterus protopteroides&quot; 
* †&quot;Protopterus regulatus&quot;
