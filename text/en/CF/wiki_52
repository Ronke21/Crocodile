<doc id="956437" wikidata="Q1304530" url="?curid=956437" title="Ohio State Route 25">
<text>State Route 25 (SR 25) is an Ohio state route that runs between Cygnet and Toledo in the US state of Ohio. The highway has a total length of . Some of the highway is listed on the National Highway System and various sections are rural four-lane highways and urbanized four-lane divided highways. SR 25 passes through farmland, commercial and residential properties.

Between Cygnet and Perrysburg, it is the relic of an old U.S. Route 25 (US 25) that passes through Bowling Green as largely a divided surface highway. From Perrysburg it crosses the Fort Meigs Memorial (Maumee–Perrysburg) Bridge running concurrently with US 20 and then follows the Anthony Wayne Trail from Maumee into downtown Toledo. The Maumee portion runs concurrently with US 24, while US 24 in greater Toledo takes, as far south as Perrysburg, the path of what used to be US 25, more distant from the newer Interstate 75 (I-75), having had its route switched with that of old US 25. North of this former terminus, SR 25 runs through downtown Toledo on Erie Street (northbound) and Michigan Street (southbound) before becoming the Greenbelt Parkway, which is cut off at I-280, terminating the route.

==Route description==
SR 25 heads westerly from its southern terminus at an interchange with I–75 in rural Wood County. The highway heads westward, before turning north at an intersection with Cygnet Road (Township Highway 3). The highway heads northeast passing through farmland as a two-lane highway closely paralleling I–75. The route turns due north and becomes a four-lane divided highway, still closely paralleling I–75, before I–75 heads northeasterly. The road has an intersection with SR 281 and then begins to enter residential properties. The highway enters Bowling Green at an interchange with US 6 and passes through commercial properties.

At a traffic signal with Gypsy Lane Road, the highway becomes a four-lane highway with a center left-turn lane until a traffic signal at Napoleon Road when the roadway loses the left turn lane. North of Napoleon Road the highway passes through residential properties, until the road enters downtown Bowling Green as Main Street. The highway passes through the downtown business district of Bowling Green and an intersection with SR 64 (Wooster Street). The road leaves downtown Bowling Green and returns to passing through residential properties. At Poe Road, SR 25 passes through commercial properties before leaving Bowling Green and becoming Dixie Highway. North of Bowling Green, the route passes through rural farmland as a rural four-lane undivided highway. The highway has a traffic signal at SR 582 (Middleton Pike) and becomes a four-lane divided highway heading northeast passing through farmland with some houses.

SR 25 enters Perrysburg passing through commercial properties and has an interchange with Interstate 475 (I–475) and US 23. At Findlay Street, the highway curves northeasterly and becomes a four-lane undivided highway (West Boundary Street), passing through commercial and residential properties. The road crosses over a set of railroad tracks, before an intersection with SR 65 (West River Road). SR 65 heads northwest concurrently with SR 25, and the concurrency has an intersection with US 20 (West Front Street). At the intersection with US 20, SR 65 turns east onto US 20 and SR 25 turns northwest onto US 20 (Maumee–Western Reserve Road). The concurrency heads northwestward as a four-lane undivided highway passing through woodland and crossing over the Maumee River. SR 25/SR 65 enters Maumee as Conant Street and has an intersection with US 24 (Anthony Wayne Trail). At this intersection, SR 25 turns northeasterly, concurrent with US 24.

US 24/SR 25 heads northeasterly as a four-lane divided highway passing through mostly residential properties. The highway has a bridge over the Ohio Turnpike. On that bridge is an intersection with Detroit Avenue. US 24 leaves SR 25 and heads north-northeast on Detroit. North of the turnpike, the highway enters Toledo and passes through woodland, with some houses and Toledo Country Club, before returning to residential properties. At Harvard Boulevard and Woodsdale Avenue, the route passes through the Toledo Zoo and under a set of railroad tracks. Northeast of the tracks, the road enters a wooded area with some commercial properties. SR 25 has an incomplete interchange with Collingwood Boulevard—the interchange is a northbound exit and southbound entrance on SR 25. This interchange allows northbound SR 25 to have access to southbound I–75 and northbound I–75 access to southbound SR 25. The highway has an interchange with I–75—this interchange is also incomplete allowing only southbound to southbound or northbound to northbound movements.

SR 25 enters downtown Toledo and the highway follows one-way streets: northbound on Erie Street and southbound on Michigan Street. The two streets are two blocks apart and the Lucas County Court House is between them. At the northeastern corner of the Court House, northbound SR 25 turns northwest on Cherry Street and joins SR 120. After a couple blocks, Cherry Street meets southbound SR 25 at Spielbusch Avenue. After a turn to the northeast, the route becomes a four-lane divided highway known as Greenbelt Parkway. Northeast of SR 120 the highway passes through woodland and industrial properties. The northern terminus of SR 25 is at an interchange with I–280, as the roadway continues northeast. The parkway ends northeast of the interchange at Galena Street in a wooded area near the Toledo Correctional Institute.

The portion of SR 25 running from the I-475/US 23 diamond interchange in Perrysburg to the I-75 interchange near downtown Toledo is included within the National Highway System. A 2009 traffic report from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) showed that the lowest traffic levels were the 5,287 vehicles used the highway daily on the section near its southern terminus, between I–75 and SR 281 in Wood County, while peak traffic volumes were 61,648 vehicles along a section of SR 25 between SR 120 and I–280.

==History==

Most of the route was at one time the Dixie Highway.

In 1923, the route that later became SR 25 was signed as SR 6. The SR 6 designation was changed to US 25 on November 11, 1926. Between 1946 and 1948, the roadway was widened to a four-lane divided highway, between Bowling Green and Maumee; the section south of Bowling Green was widened to a four-lane divided highway between 1951 and 1953. US 25 was decommissioned in 1973, and SR 25 was signed along its northern section. In 1986, SR 25 and US 24 switched routes north of the intersection at Detroit Avenue. Between 1997 and 1999, the road from the second interchange with I–75 and I–280 was widened into a four-lane divided highway.

In 2004, a stretch of SR 25 in Wood County won a Perpetual Pavement Award from the Asphalt Pavement Association. The section was originally constructed in between 1937 and 1940 as one of the first &quot;deep-strength&quot; asphalt pavements built in Ohio.

<text>Jean Abraham Chrétien Oudemans (Amsterdam, 16 December 1827 – Utrecht, 14 December 1906) was a Dutch astronomer. He was the director of the Utrecht Observatory from 1875 until 1898, when he retired.

Oudemans was born in Amsterdam, son of the poet, teacher and philologist Anthonie Oudemans Sr. and Jacoba Adriana Hammecker. He entered Leiden University when he was just 16 as a student of the noted astronomer Frederik Kaiser. He became a high school teacher in Leiden when he was just 19 (1846). The next six years he worked on his dissertation on the determination of the latitude of Leiden. Next he studied asteroids and variable stars, meanwhile hoping for an academic appointment. In 1855 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. 

He married Pauline Adriana Verdam (the daughter of a well-known mathematics professor ) in 1856. In the same year he was appointed a professor at Utrecht University and became the first director of its observatory. However, his interest drew him towards geography. He traveled to the Dutch East Indies as head surveyor, and worked in that capacity for 18 years, publishing his works on the triangulation of the island of Java in six books.

In 1874 he organized an astronomical expedition to the island of Réunion to observe the transit of Venus but, due to bad weather, the results were disappointing.

Oudemans crater on Mars was named in his honor.

A brother was the botanist Corneille Antoine Jean Abram Oudemans. One of his sons was Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans Jzn, one of the fathers of cryptozoology.

<doc id="956447" wikidata="Q3492184" url="?curid=956447" title="Circle of Snakes">
<text>Circle of Snakes is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Danzig. It was released on August 31, 2004. It is the first studio album by the band since their debut recording not to have a number incorporated into its title (though the debut has often since been retroactively called &quot;Danzig 1&quot;).

==Music and recording==
&quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; was recorded at Ocean Studios and Paramount Recording Studios, both based in California.

As with the band&#x27;s eponymous debut, &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; features a somewhat stripped-down sound.

For the recording of his vocals on &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot;, Glenn Danzig sought out microphones that would give his vocals more bottom end. Danzig&#x27;s vocals are less prominent on most songs; instead the guitars, bass and drums are at the top of the album&#x27;s mix. The album also features a notably heavy guitar tone.

&quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; marked the first Danzig recording to feature guitar work by Tommy Victor of Prong. Victor had been an occasional touring member of the band since 1996. Bevan Davies, previously a touring drummer for Jerry Cantrell, also appears on the album.

The album begins with &quot;Wotans Procession&quot;, a dirge-like instrumental track.

The lyrics for the song &quot;SkinCarver&quot; suggest a serial killer with a fascination for human pelts.

The song &quot;Skull Forrest&quot; originated from a dream experienced by Glenn Danzig, in which he walked &quot;through a corridor full of bones and rotting corpses, and people&#x27;s faces I knew.&quot;

The track &quot;1000 Devils Reign&quot; is notably melodic amongst most other songs on &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot;. It served as promotion for the album, finding airplay on the Sirius Satellite Radio station Hard Attack.

The track &quot;Night, BeSodom&quot; was originally tentatively titled &quot;Devilsnight&quot;.

==Reception==
* &quot;AllMusic&quot; - &quot;Glenn Danzig returns to his immediate post-Misfits roots with the stripped-down &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot;, an 11-track chunk of brutality that forgoes the murky alt-metal and industrial meanderings that marred many of his mid-to-late-&#x27;90s offerings.&quot;
* &quot;KNAC&quot; - &quot;&quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; is a damn fine metallic rock record; and an excellent Danzig record. Label-changes, line-up changes, and time have not stopped this man from making great music.&quot;
* &quot;antiMusic&quot; - &quot;&quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; is a heavy record. Everything you would want out of this band is here...From start to finish &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; is full of ups and downs, darks and lights, but proves to be a completely satisfying album.&quot;

<text>Deep Wound was an American hardcore punk band formed in 1982 in Westfield, Massachusetts. They released one self-titled 7-inch and contributed two songs to the compilation LP, &quot;Bands That Could Be God&quot;, both of which are sought after by fans and record collectors alike. The band influenced the Massachusetts hardcore scene and the development of grindcore.

==History==
In the early 1980s, J Mascis and Deep Wound vocalist Charlie Nakajima lived in Amherst, Massachusetts, and attended the same high school. In 1982, guitarist Lou Barlow met bassist Scott Helland at the Oi! singles bin in a local record shop. Soon after, Helland posted a flier looking for musicians who were influenced by bands such as Anti-Pasti and Discharge. Mascis responded to the ad and was driven by his father to Barlow&#x27;s place in Westfield to audition as the band’s drummer. Although the band already had a singer, Mascis convinced them to replace him with Nakajima, and Deep Wound&#x27;s line-up was complete. 

The band quickly recorded a demo cassette and began to play shows in Boston with local hardcore bands such as SSD, The F.U.&#x27;s, Jerry&#x27;s Kids, etc., and often opened for hardcore punk bands playing in Western Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the band recorded its self-titled EP, released on Radiobeat Records, and contributed two tracks to Gerard Cosloy&#x27;s &quot;Bands That Could Be God&quot; compilation LP. Studio recordings of a later session with Gerard singing have apparently been lost. As the band progressed, they began playing faster and faster, eventually developing a blur-type sound that could verge on experimental noise.

Deep Wound disbanded in 1984 with J Mascis and Lou Barlow going on to form Dinosaur Jr. Barlow later left Dinosaur Jr. and formed Sebadoh, Sentridoh, and Folk Implosion. Scott Helland formed the Outpatients, played bass in Darkside NYC and is now the guitarist for Frenchy and the Punk. Charlie Nakajima later formed GobbleHoof. J Mascis can often be seen sporting a &#x27;Deep Wound&#x27; sweater (knitted by his mother) in Dinosaur Jr. photographs.

In April 2004, Sonic Youth played a show at John Green Hall on the Smith College campus in Northampton, Massachusetts with J Mascis and Sebadoh as the opening acts and the anticipation was that the two would reunite for a few Dinosaur Jr. songs. Unexpectedly though, after J Mascis&#x27; set, he returned to the stage on drums and Charlie Nakajima came out to address the crowd. Lou Barlow and Scott Helland soon appeared and the stunned audience witnessed a one-song Deep Wound reunion.

In 2005, British record label Damaged Goods released a Discography LP compiling the 1982 demo, self-titled 7-inch and the tracks from &quot;Bands That Could Be God&quot;.

In June 2013 Helland joined the members of Dinosaur Jr. to perform the song &quot;Training Ground&quot; at the Governor&#x27;s Ball in New York City.

<text>Sweating sickness, also known as the sweats, English sweating sickness, English sweat or sudor anglicus in Latin, was a mysterious and contagious disease that struck England and later continental Europe in a series of epidemics beginning in 1485. Other major outbreaks of the English sweating sickness occurred in 1508, 1517, and 1528, with the last outbreak in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden and death often occurred within hours. Sweating sickness epidemics were unique compared with other disease outbreaks of the time: whereas other epidemics were typically urban and long-lasting, cases of sweating sickness spiked and receded very quickly, and heavily affected rural populations. Its cause remains unknown, although it has been suggested that an unknown species of hantavirus was responsible.

== Signs and symptoms ==
John Caius was a physician in Shrewsbury in 1551, when an outbreak occurred, and he described the symptoms and signs of the disease in &quot;A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse&quot; (1552), which is the main historical source of knowledge of the disease. It began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), dizziness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great exhaustion. The cold stage lasted from half an hour to three hours, after which the hot and sweating stage began. The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. A sense of heat, headache, delirium, rapid pulse, and intense thirst accompanied the sweat. Palpitations and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms. No skin eruptions were noted by observers. In the final stages there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought was fatal if the patient were permitted to give way to it. One attack of the disease did not result in immunity to subsequent occurrences, and some people suffered several bouts before dying. The disease typically lasted through one full day before recovery or death took place. The disease tended to occur in summer and early autumn.

Thomas Forestier, a physician during the first outbreak, provided a written account of his own experiences with the sweating sickness in 1485. Forestier put great emphasis on the sudden breathlessness commonly associated with the final hours of sufferers. Forestier claimed in an account written for other physicians that &quot;loathsome vapours&quot; had congregated around the heart and lungs. His observations point towards a pulmonary component of the disease.

== Cause ==
The cause is unknown. Commentators then and now have blamed the sewage, poor sanitation, and contaminated water supplies. The first confirmed outbreak was in August 1485 at the end of the Wars of the Roses, leading to speculation that it may have been brought from France by French mercenaries. However, an earlier outbreak may have affected the city of York in June 1485, before Henry Tudor&#x27;s army landed, although records of that disease&#x27;s symptoms are not adequate enough to be certain. Regardless, the &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot; mentions that Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby cited the sweating sickness as reason not to join Richard III&#x27;s army prior to the Battle of Bosworth.

Relapsing fever, a disease spread by ticks and lice, has been proposed as a possible cause. It occurs most often during the summer months, as did the original sweating sickness. However, relapsing fever is marked by a prominent black scab at the site of the tick bite and a subsequent skin rash, neither of which are described as the symptoms of sweating sickness.

The suggestion of ergotism was ruled out due to England growing much less rye (which ergots typically grow on) than the rest of Europe.

Researchers have noted symptoms overlap with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and have proposed an unknown hantavirus as the cause. Hantavirus species are zoonotic diseases carried by bats, rodents, and several insectivores. Sharing of similar trends (including seasonal occurrences, fluctuations multiple times a year, and occasional occurrences between major outbreaks) suggest the English sweating sickness may have been rodent-borne. The epidemiology of hantavirus correlates with the trends of the English sweating sickness. Hantavirus infections generally do not strike infants, children, or the elderly, and mostly affect middle-aged adults. In contrast to most epidemics of the medieval ages, the English sweating sickness also predominantly affected the middle-aged. A criticism of this hypothesis is that modern-day hantaviruses, unlike the sweating sickness, do not randomly disappear and can be seen affecting isolated people. Another is that sweating sickness was thought to have been transmitted from human to human, whereas hantaviruses are rarely spread that way. However, infection via human contact has been suggested in hantavirus outbreaks in Argentina.

In 2004, microbiologist Edward McSweegan suggested the disease may have been an outbreak of anthrax poisoning. He hypothesised that the victims could have been infected with anthrax spores present in raw wool or infected animal carcasses, and suggested exhuming victims for testing.

Numerous attempts have been made to define the disease origin by molecular biology methods, but have so far failed due to a lack of available DNA or RNA.

=== Transmission ===
Transmission mostly remains a mystery, with only a few pieces of evidence in writing. Despite greatly affecting the rural and working classes of the time, the sweating sickness did not discriminate, as it was no less likely to affect young, seemingly fit men, including those of the elite or privileged classes. Based upon recorded accounts, the mortality rate among victims was highest in males aged 30–40 years. The fact that it infected all levels of society, from rich to poor, earned the sweating sickness various nicknames, such as &quot;Stoop Gallant&quot; or &quot;Stoop Knave&quot; — referencing how the &#x27;proud&#x27; castes were forced to &#x27;stoop&#x27; and face their own humanity.

The large number of people present in London to witness the coronation of Henry VII may have accelerated the spread of the disease, and indeed many other airborne pathogens.

==Epidemiology==
===Fifteenth century===

Sweating sickness first came to the attention of physicians at the beginning of the reign of Henry VII, in 1485. It was frequently fatal; half the population perished in some areas. The Ricardian scholar John Ashdown-Hill conjectures that Richard III fell victim the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field and that this accounted for his sleepless night and excessive thirst in the early part of the battle. There is no definitive statement that the sickness was present in Henry Tudor&#x27;s troops landing at Milford Haven. The battle&#x27;s victor, Henry VII, arrived in London on 28 August, and the disease broke out there on 19 September 1485; it had killed several thousand people by its conclusion in late October that year. Among those killed were two lord mayors, six aldermen, and three sheriffs.

Mass superstition and paranoia followed the new plague. The Battle of Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses, between the houses of Lancaster and York. Richard III, the final York king, was killed there and Henry VII was crowned. As chaos, grief, and anger spread, people searched for a culprit for the plague. English people started to believe it was sent by God to punish supporters of Henry VII.

Because of its extremely rapid and fatal course, and the sweating which gave it its name, the sickness was regarded as being quite distinct from the Black Death, the pestilential fever, or other epidemics previously known. It reached Ireland in 1492 when the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record the death of James Fleming, 7th Baron Slane from the &quot;pláigh allais&quot; [&quot;perspiring plague&quot;], newly come to Ireland. The &quot;Annals of Connacht&quot; also record this obituary, and the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; record &quot;an unusual plague in Meath&quot; of 24 hours&#x27; duration; people recovered if they survived it beyond that 24-hour period. The sickness didn&#x27;t affect infants or young children. English chronicler Richard Grafton mentioned the sweating sickness of 1485 in his work &quot;Grafton&#x27;s Chronicle: or History of England&quot;. He noted the common treatment of the disease was to go immediately to bed at the first sign of symptoms; there, the affected person was to remain still for the entire 24-hour period of the illness, abstaining from any solid food and limiting water intake.

===Sixteenth century===

The ailment was not recorded from 1492 to 1502. It may have been the condition which afflicted Henry VII&#x27;s son Arthur, Prince of Wales, and Arthur&#x27;s wife, Catherine of Aragon, in March 1502; their illness was described as &quot;a malign vapour which proceeded from the air&quot;. Researchers who opened Arthur&#x27;s tomb in 2002 could not determine the exact cause of death. Catherine recovered, but Arthur died on 2 April 1502 in his home at Ludlow Castle, six months short of his sixteenth birthday.

A second, less widespread outbreak occurred in 1507, followed by a third and much more severe epidemic in 1517, a few cases of which may have also spread to Calais. In the 1517 epidemic, the disease showed a particular affinity for the English; the ambassador from Venice at the time commented on the peculiarly low number of cases in foreign visitors. A similar effect was noted in 1528 when Calais (then an English territory) experienced an outbreak that did not spread into France. The 1528 outbreak, the fourth, reached epidemic proportions. The earliest written reference to it was on 5 June 1528, in a letter to Bishop Tunstall of London from Brian Tuke, who said that he had fled to Stepney to avoid infection from a servant at his house who was ill with &quot;the sweat.&quot;, suggesting that it broke out in London at the end of May. The sweats spread over the whole of England, save the far north. It did not spread to Scotland, though it did reach Ireland where Lord Chancellor Hugh Inge, who died on 3 August 1528, was the most prominent victim. Mortality was very high in London; Henry VIII broke up the court and left London, frequently changing his residence. In 1529 Thomas Cromwell lost his wife and two daughters to the disease. It is believed several of the closest people to Henry VIII contracted the sickness. His love letters to his mistress, Anne Boleyn, reveal that physicians believed Anne had contracted the illness. Henry sent his second-most trusted physician to her aid, his first being unavailable, and she survived. Cardinal Wolsey contracted the illness and survived.

The disease was brought to Hamburg by a ship from England in July 1529. It spread along the Baltic coast, north to Denmark, Sweden, and Norway as well as south to Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Marburg, and Göttingen in September of that year. Cases were unknown in Italy or France, except in the English-controlled Pale of Calais. It emerged in Flanders and the Netherlands, possibly transmitted directly from England by travellers; it appeared simultaneously in the cities of Antwerp and Amsterdam on the morning of 27 September. In each place, it prevailed for a short time, generally not more than two weeks. By the end of 1529, it had entirely disappeared except in the eastern part of the Swiss Confederacy, where it lingered into the next year. The disease did not recur in mainland Europe.

===Final outbreak===

The last major outbreak of the disease occurred in England in 1551. Although burial patterns in smaller towns in Europe suggest that the disease may have been present elsewhere first, the outbreak is recorded to have begun in Shrewsbury in April. It killed around 1,000 there, spreading quickly throughout the rest of England and all but disappearing by October. It was more prevalent among younger men than other groups, possibly due to their greater social exposure. John Caius wrote his eyewitness account &quot;A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse&quot;. Henry Machin also recorded it in his diary:

The &quot;Annals&quot; of Halifax Parish of 1551 records 44 deaths in an outbreak there. An outbreak called &#x27;sweating sickness&#x27; occurred in Tiverton, Devon in 1644, recorded in Martin Dunsford&#x27;s History, killing 443 people, 105 of them buried in October. However, no medical particulars were recorded, and the date falls well after the generally accepted disappearance of the &#x27;sweating sickness&#x27; in 1551.

==Picardy sweat==

Between 1718 and 1918 an illness with some similarities occurred in France, known as the Picardy sweat. It was significantly less lethal than the English Sweat but with a strikingly high frequency of outbreaks; some 200 were recorded during the period. Llywelyn Roberts noted &quot;a great similarity between the two diseases.&quot; There was intense sweating and fever, and Henry Tidy found &quot;no substantial reason to doubt the identity of &quot;sudor anglicus&quot; and Picardy sweat.&quot; There were also notable differences between the Picardy sweat and the English sweating sickness. It was accompanied by a rash, which was not described as a feature of the English disease. Henry Tidy argued that John Caius&#x27;s report applies to fulminant cases fatal within a few hours, in which case no eruption may develop. The Picardy sweat appears to have had a different epidemiology than the English sweat in that individuals who slept close to the ground and/or lived on farms appeared more susceptible, supporting the theory that the disease could be rodent-borne, common in hantaviruses. In a 1906 outbreak of Picardy sweat which struck 6,000 people, a commission led by bacteriologist André Chantemesse attributed infection to the fleas of field mice.

<text>BMW has been producing engines for automobiles, motorcycles and aircraft since 1917, when the company began production of an inline-six aircraft engine. They have been producing automobile engines since 1933.

== Motorcycle engines ==
== Automotive petrol engines ==
BMW is well known for its history of inline-six (straight-six) engines, a layout it continues to use to this day despite most other manufacturers switching to a V6 layout. The more common inline-four and V8 layouts are also produced by BMW, and at times the company has produced inline-three, V10 and V12 engines, BMW also engineered non-production customised engines especially for motorsports which include the M12/13 1.5-Liter straight 4 piston turbocharged engine from 1982 to 1987 for Brabham, Arrows and Benetton Formula One teams, the E41/P83 3.0-Liter V10 from 2000 to 2005 for Williams F1 Team and the P86/8 2.4-Liter V8 for their own F1 team partnering with Sauber F1 from 2006 to 2009, with which the company enjoyed its first and best finish at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix as a full works F1 manufacturer team, finishing the race with their winning driver Robert Kubica, and Nick Heidfeld in second place.

British super car manufacturer McLaren Automotive, a manufacturer of road-going sports cars based on Formula One technology, decided to work with BMW for the development of their first ever production car—the McLaren F1 in 1993 for the engineering and customization of its engine—the S70/2, which had a 6.1-Liter 60° V12 DOHC configuration. Only 106 units of the cars were produced by McLaren, the S70 engine holding the record of the fewest production engines by BMW to date. 

Prototype V16 engines have been made despite not reaching production. These prototypes were the 1987 BMW Goldfisch V16 6.7 litre engine and the 2004 Rolls-Royce 100EX 9.0 litre engine.
BMW has also made prototype V6 engines

<doc id="956480" wikidata="Q677627" url="?curid=956480" title="She-Hulk">
<text>She-Hulk (Jennifer Susan Walters) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Buscema, the character first appeared in &quot;The Savage She-Hulk&quot; #1 (November 1979). Walters is a lawyer who, after an assassination attempt, received an emergency blood transfusion from her cousin, Bruce Banner, and acquired a milder version of his Hulk condition. As such, Walters becomes a large, powerful, green-hued version of herself. Unlike Banner in his Hulk form, Walters largely retains her normal personality in her She-Hulk form, in particular the majority of her intelligence and emotional control. Furthermore, though she&#x27;s much taller in her She-Hulk form, Walters&#x27;s body mass is just as dense as that of her normal human self. In any case, like Hulk, She-Hulk is still susceptible to outbursts of anger and becomes much stronger when enraged. In later series, her transformation is permanent, and she often breaks the fourth wall for humorous effect and running gags, as the first major Marvel character to do so frequently, ahead of the more famous fourth wall breaker Deadpool.

She-Hulk has been a member of the Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D., Defenders, Fantastic Four, Heroes for Hire, and Fantastic Force at various points in her history. As a highly skilled lawyer who became a superhero by accident, she frequently leverages her legal and personal experience to serve as legal counsel to various superheroes and other superhumans.

She-Hulk has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes. Since her original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. Walters made her live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) with the Disney+ original series &quot;She-Hulk: Attorney at Law&quot; (2022), portrayed by Tatiana Maslany.

==Publication history==
She-Hulk was created by Stan Lee, who wrote only the first issue, and was the last character he created for Marvel Comics, until his return to comics with &quot;Ravage 2099&quot; in 1992. The reason behind the character&#x27;s creation had to do with the success of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (1977–1982) and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; television series, both from Universal Television. Marvel was afraid that the show&#x27;s executives might suddenly introduce a female version of the Hulk, as producer Kenneth Johnson had already done with &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. So Marvel decided to publish their own version of such a character to make sure that if a similar one showed up in the television series, Marvel would own the rights. Kenneth Johnson later said the plans for season five of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; was to have Banner&#x27;s sister suffering from a disease where only the blood of a sibling could save her life, which would turn her into a &quot;woman Hulk who was crazy and scary and dangerous&quot;. But six episodes into the season, a new boss at CBS decided to cancel the show with immediate effect, ending the last season with episode seven.

All but the first issue of &quot;The Savage She-Hulk&quot; were written by David Anthony Kraft and penciled by Mike Vosburg, and most issues were inked by Frank Springer. Vosburg later remarked, &quot;The oddest thing about that book was that Frank drew really beautiful women, I drew really beautiful women, and yet, the She-Hulk was never overly attractive.&quot; The &quot;Savage She-Hulk&quot; series lasted until 1982, where it ended with #25 (March 1982). She-Hulk then made guest appearances in other characters&#x27; books. Her earliest guest-starring adventures followed no specific story line, besides her recurring bad luck with automobiles. She-Hulk also appeared in the limited series, &quot;Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions&quot; (June to August 1982), in which numerous superheroes are kidnapped from Earth to fight in space.

She-Hulk becomes a member of the Avengers in &quot;Avengers&quot; #221 (July 1982). Her early Avengers appearances continued the running gag about her car troubles. She-Hulk also made occasional guest appearances in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. Her appearance in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #233 (July 1983) was drawn by John Byrne, who would later become strongly associated with the character. 

At the conclusion of the first &quot;Secret Wars&quot; miniseries, She-Hulk joins the Fantastic Four (&quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #265 (April 1984)). During She-Hulk&#x27;s tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #16: &quot;The Aladdin Effect&quot;, &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; No. 17: &quot;Revenge of the Living Monolith&quot;, and &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #18: &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot;. All three graphic novels appeared in 1985. The last, #18, appearing in November 1985, was written and illustrated by then-Fantastic Four writer/artist John Byrne.

She-Hulk regained a solo series in 1989, &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; (maintaining the 1985 graphic novel&#x27;s title). &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; ran for 60 issues. Issues #1–8, 31–46, and 48–50 were written and drawn by Byrne. Byrne&#x27;s She-Hulk stories satirized comic books and introduced She-Hulk&#x27;s awareness that she is a comic book character. Two issues tested the limits of the Comics Code: #34 makes reference to the 1991 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; cover in which actress Demi Moore appeared nude and pregnant (She-Hulk&#x27;s version has her holding a green beach ball to imitate Moore&#x27;s pregnancy). In issue #40, She-Hulk is depicted jumping rope (apparently) in the nude, with her breasts and genital area covered by blur lines; the cover of the same issue shows her covering herself with a form sporting the lines &quot;Approved [...] Comics Code&quot;. Other writers to contribute to this series include Steve Gerber (#10, 11 and 13–23), Simon Furman, and Peter David.

During &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot;, the character continued making numerous guest appearances. In 1990, She-Hulk appeared in the two-issue limited series &quot;She-Hulk: Ceremony&quot;, adapted from a Dwayne McDuffie pitch for a cancelled &quot;She-Hulk&quot; romantic comedy ongoing series.

&quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; ran until issue #60 (February 1994), making it the longest-running solo title of any Marvel superheroine up to that point. After the cancellation of She-Hulk&#x27;s second solo series, she continued making backup, one-shot, and team appearances in &quot;Fantastic Force&quot; (starting with issue #13 in November 1995), the 1996 miniseries &quot;Doc Samson&quot; #1–4 (January–April 1996), &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot; #8–19 (February 1998 through the series finale in January 1999), and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Her next major appearance was in the May 2002 one-shot titled &quot;Thing and She-Hulk: The Long Night&quot;.

In May 2004, &quot;She-Hulk&quot; was given a new title and launched in a wave of six new Marvel books. Despite favorable critical notices, the new series could not escape the low sales numbers that the titles received from their initial cluster-style launch. Marvel brought the series to a close with #12 and promised a re-launch of the title (as a &quot;second season&quot;) eight months later. The eight-month gap is alluded to in the body of the story itself.

With the original creative team (Dan Slott and Juan Bobillo) from the previous series, the book returned eight months later as promised in October 2005. The third issue was billed as the 100th issue of a She-Hulk comic book, and had story art by numerous artists, including Vosburg. There was no new artwork by Buscema or Byrne, who were represented by reprints of &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; #1 and &quot;The Savage She-Hulk&quot; #1.

Dan Slott&#x27;s last issue is #21; with 33 issues, Slott has written the most solo issues of She-Hulk. Peter David became the new writer with &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #22. Marvel Comics announced that &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #38 (February 2009) would be the final issue of the series. Peter David commented on his blog that sales of the book were hurt due to discrepancies between his book and Jeph Loeb&#x27;s &quot;Hulk&quot; series, caused by editorial error:

The mantle of She-Hulk is challenged by Lyra, the daughter of Hulk and Thundra, who is the lead character in &quot;All-New Savage She-Hulk&quot;, a miniseries written by Fred Van Lente.

She-Hulk appeared in &quot;FF&quot; by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred, which debuted in November 2012.

An ongoing &quot;She-Hulk&quot; series, written by Charles Soule and drawn by Javier Pulido, debuted in 2014. It was revealed in October 2014 that Soule and Pulido&#x27;s run of &quot;She-Hulk&quot;, which had the character facing off against Matt Murdock in court, would end with issue 12.

Since May 2015, She-Hulk has appeared as one of the main characters in &quot;A-Force&quot;, an all-female Avengers spin-off being launched by G. Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; crossover.

She-Hulk starred in the comic titled &quot;Hulk&quot; beginning December 2016. The series showed how she dealt with the trauma stemming from her cousin&#x27;s death, and the injuries sustained at the hands of Thanos, as fallout from the &quot;Civil War II&quot; event. She appeared colored grey, similar to Hulk&#x27;s &quot;Joe Fixit&quot; persona, and there were great differences in tone from her previous lighthearted adventures. The title was cancelled with issue #163 in March 2018.

In 2022, &quot;She-Hulk&quot; returned as an ongoing series by writer Rainbow Rowell and artist Rogê Antônio. The series returns to the lighthearted tone of the previous comics and focuses on She-Hulk&#x27;s return to practicing law. The series ended in 2024 with 25 issues over 2 volumes.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;The Savage She-Hulk&quot;===

Jennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner (Hulk), is the small and somewhat shy daughter of Los Angeles County Sheriff William Morris Walters and Elaine (née Banner) Walters (who died in a car crash when Jennifer was 17). Operatives of Nicholas Trask, a crime boss who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on the day that Banner visited her to tell her about his transformation into the Hulk. Since no other donors with her blood type were available, Banner provided his blood for a transfusion; as they already shared the same blood type and DNA, his gamma-irradiated blood, combined with the adrenaline from emotional stress, transformed Jennifer into the green-skinned She-Hulk when the mobsters tried to finish her off at the hospital. She then used her new powers to take down Trask, who was killed when the earth-boring device he rode malfunctioned, plunging him into the molten core of the Earth.

As She-Hulk, Jennifer possessed powers similar to those of her cousin, though at a reduced level. She also possessed a less monstrous, more Amazonian appearance. Initially, anger triggered the transformation to her She-Hulk form (as with Bruce Banner&#x27;s). Like her cousin Bruce, his counterpart, the Leader, Doc Samson and most other persons mutated by exposure to gamma radiation over the years, her mutated form was originally explained as being molded by her subconscious desire to look like the ideal woman. She eventually gains control of her transformations when Michael Morbius cures her of a lethal blood disease. As a criminal defense lawyer, she defended Morbius when he was tried for serial murder and managed to reduce the conviction to involuntary manslaughter, considering his medical condition.

A geneticist called &quot;Doc&quot; obtains a sample of She-Hulk&#x27;s blood that was given to Morbius when she was sick and attempts to capture her to get more of it, hoping to use it to create an army of super-villains. When she escapes, he uses a serum made of her blood to transform his lab assistant Ralph &quot;Ralphie&quot; Hutchins. She-Hulk attempted to stop him, but her unfamiliarity with Hulk strength caused Hutchins to sustain fatal injuries and resurrect into several new physical forms, each with different powers. Finally, he evolved into an incorporeal being; with no trace of his humanity remaining, Hutchins opted to leave Earth peacefully.

Jennifer eventually decides to permanently retain her She Hulk form, feeling that it not only makes her a better lawyer, but also gives her an assertiveness and confidence that she never had as a human. After her brief solo career, she joined the Avengers. This led to her being transported to Battleworld by the Beyonder and her participation in the Secret Wars, is most notable for sparking her long-standing rivalry with the newly empowered Titania. After the heroes returned to Earth, she temporarily replaced the Thing (who, having been repeatedly de-powered during the event, opted to stay in Battleworld for some time as a form of soul-searching) as a member of the Fantastic Four.

During her tenure with the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk met and started a romance with Wyatt Wingfoot. One day, she had to prevent a radiation leak in a downed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. This radiation exposure drastically affected Jennifer: she could no longer transform back into her original human form. However, this was an agreeable turn of events for her, since she preferred being She-Hulk, and it was revealed much later by Leonard Samson and Reed Richards that the block was purely psychological.

Shortly after that, she appeared before the Supreme Court, where she battled Titania again.

===&quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot;===
After her Fantastic Four years, She-Hulk rejoined the Avengers for a while. She became hypnotized by the Ringmaster into becoming a performer in the Circus of Crime, and battled the Headmen. With Spider-Man, she defeated the Headmen and became an assistant District Attorney and began working for New York City district attorney Blake Tower. Here she met Louise &quot;Weezie&quot; Grant Mason, formerly the Golden Age superheroine the Blonde Phantom. She had a long series of unusual encounters, including when she battled Doctor Bong, first contended against Xemnu the Living Titan, encountered &quot;Nick St. Christopher&quot;, and encountered &quot;Spragg the Living Hill/Comet&quot;.

&quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; #15 introduced a grey version of She-Hulk that appeared at night only and shared a lot in common with the Hulk, such as having a childlike mind, speaking in the third person and divorcing from her Jennifer Walters identity, referring to Jennifer as &quot;puny Jennifer&quot;, She-Hulk returned to normal in the following issue, with her green coloration returning in &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk #17&quot;. She-Hulk later discovered that Louise Mason had manipulated Tower into hiring her, so that Mason might again star in a comic book (and thus avoid dying of old age). Later, while doing legal work for Heroes for Hire, She-Hulk spent some time dating Luke Cage.

After a time, She-Hulk returns to the Avengers. Repeated exposure to the presence of her teammate Jack of Hearts, who has the innate ability to absorb radiation that is around him, leads to She-Hulk being unable to control her changes. After realizing that she becomes a feral monster when transforming into She-Hulk, Jennifer flees out of fear that she will endanger her friends and others, leading to the &quot;Search for She-Hulk&quot; storyline.

The other Avengers track her to the town of Bone, Idaho, where Jennifer is lying low but the anxiety of being found prompts her to change, causing her to damage much of the town. Her cousin shows up but fails to reason with her; he &quot;Hulks out&quot; and the two fight — the devastation to the town subsequently being blamed on the Hulk. Jack of Hearts eventually shows up and transfers the radiation back into her body, giving Jennifer back control of her She-Hulk form. Later, following the deaths of Jack of Hearts and Scott Lang, she succumbs to her savage side once again, which resulted in her tearing the Vision in half. It is then revealed that all of the events were caused by the Scarlet Witch.

Psychological limitations inhibit her transformation between her two forms. For a time, as detailed in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #4 (March 2006), Jennifer works as a relief volunteer helping to repair Bone. She gains confidence after solving a murder mystery, reveals her green alter-ego to the entire town, and then uses her strength to make many more repairs. This, combined with Leonard Samson&#x27;s new &#x27;gamma-charger&#x27;, gives her full control over her transformations for, as she said, &#x27;the time being&#x27;.

===&quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;===
In the DC/Marvel crossover &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;, She-Hulk first appears being brainwashed by Starro when the Avengers battle her, grabbing a startled Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) by her leg, before the latter blasts her away with her powers. She later assists the Avengers in the subsequent hunt for the 12 artifacts needed to trap the DC villain Krona, first battling Aquaman in Asgard, and later in the Savage Land with the rest of the heroes. During the final battle against Krona and his forces, she assists Wonder Woman in her battle against Surtur, and eventually appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event.

===Single Green Female===
The events of &quot;The Search for She-Hulk&quot;, combined with her own lack of personal responsibility and the potential legal ramifications of her saving the world swaying juries leads Jennifer back to the legal profession in a more full-time capacity when she is offered a partnership in the New York firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg &amp; Holliway (GLK&amp;H), which plans to establish a &quot;Superhuman Law&quot; division. As part of the offer, Jennifer agrees to revert back into her human form while practicing law.

Her experiences at GLK&amp;H change Jennifer&#x27;s worldview significantly; she now realizes that as Jennifer Walters and She-Hulk, she has much to offer the world in both forms. She also learns that her powers as She-Hulk are dependent on her own physical abilities and takes up bodybuilding to raise her strength to a previously unimaginable level.

===&quot;Civil War&quot;===
She-Hulk registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, and is a supporter of Tony Stark (Iron Man). However, as an attorney, she advised individuals on both sides of the Civil War. She agreed to file suit against Peter Parker for fraud on behalf of her father-in-law, &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; publisher J. Jonah Jameson. Her intention is to keep the suit tied up in the courts indefinitely. She is also the lawyer for Speedball in &quot;Civil War: Front Line&quot;.

In &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #14 (2006), Clay Quartermain of S.H.I.E.L.D. informs Jennifer that she has been drafted into the organization as a result of her registration. Her mission is to fight various foes of the Hulk while training heroes under the Initiative. She serves with the Hulkbusters: Clay Quartermain, Agent Crimson, Agent Cheesecake and Agent Beefcake.

===&quot;World War Hulk&quot;===
Due to her involvement in S.H.I.E.L.D., She-Hulk derives a bit of information suggesting that the organization knows of her cousin&#x27;s whereabouts. Anticipating a problem, Tony Stark has She-Hulk secretly injected with S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology that transforms her to human form. Enraged, she tells Stark that, although he may have taken She-Hulk out of the equation, he still has to face Jennifer Walters, one of the best lawyers in the country. Jennifer informs Stark that he&#x27;s miscalculated: She-Hulk would have just pummeled him, but Jennifer Walters has the ability to destroy him.

On her way home, Jennifer runs into Amadeus Cho, a young genius out looking for friends of the Hulk. Cho, whom the Hulk once saved, discovered what the Illuminati had done to the Hulk, and he wants help in finding him. Cho temporarily restores Jennifer&#x27;s powers so that she can take out Doc Samson, who came to apprehend Cho for Reed Richards and Tony Stark. Cho says he can permanently restore Jennifer&#x27;s powers if she will join him, but she politely refuses, instead directing him to Hercules and Angel.

During the &quot;World War Hulk&quot; storyline, a re-powered She-Hulk assists in the evacuation of Manhattan. She tries to reason with her cousin, who has just destroyed Stark Tower during his battle with Iron Man. The Hulk warns her to leave, but she stands her ground. After she lands a punch squarely to his face, the Hulk smashes her into the ground, creating a crater around her body. As he moves on to his next confrontation, all Jennifer can say is: &quot;God help us all.&quot;

Jennifer is held captive with the other defeated heroes at Madison Square Garden, which the Hulk has converted into a gladiatorial arena. The heroes have been implanted with the same obedience discs that compelled the Hulk and his allies to fight one another during their time on the planet Sakaar.

Jennifer returns to the law firm to work on suing Tony Stark for stealing her powers. She is subpoenaed to give a testimony in a case in which Mallory Book is trying to prove that the Leader&#x27;s criminal acts are the result of a shift of personality induced by his mutation, and an addiction to his gamma irradiated powers, and that he thus cannot be held accountable for his actions. During her testimony, Jennifer realizes that she herself is &quot;addicted&quot; to being She-Hulk; Mallory forces her to admit that she has had a long list of sexual partners as She-Hulk. After the testimony, Pug appears and the two spend an evening together as friends, which cheers her up. She confronts Mallory the next day and tells her that she will put a stop to her Leader case. However, it is revealed that the Leader has been acquitted of his crimes.

There is an apparent inconsistency between the &quot;She-Hulk&quot; and &quot;World War Hulk&quot; comics: in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #19, the Leader is on trial in New York City, which is being cleaned up after the Hulk&#x27;s recent attack. The action in the issue takes place during or after the events of &quot;World War Hulk&quot;. However, Jennifer appears as She-Hulk in the first and second issues of &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, during which the Hulk is destroying New York City. The discrepancy is resolved in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #20: Jennifer explains that Tony Stark temporarily disabled the nanobots to allow her to assist in the battle against her cousin, only to reactivate them when the battle was over. She amends her suit against Stark to demand the permanent deactivation of the nanobots.

===Post-&quot;World War Hulk&quot;===
At some point after &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, Jennifer was brought before the Living Tribunal, and asked to weigh her universe against a newer, better &quot;cosmic trophy wife&quot; version, described by Walters as &quot;an ultimate universe.&quot; Her universe wins, and she resigns from the Magistrati.

After the Leader&#x27;s trial, Artie Zix reveals himself as RT-Z9 and holds the main staff of GLK&amp;H hostage while asking them questions at the behest of a group of aliens from a corner of the galaxy recently discovered by the Watcher Qyre. The aliens, called the Recluses, wish to keep their existence a secret. She-Hulk earlier decreed that Qyre not reveal knowledge of the Recluses&#x27; existence at the meetings of the Watchers. This had serious repercussions: it is revealed at the close of &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #20 that an evil being has conquered that portion of the galaxy, and is preparing an assault on all of creation. Qyre, who holds knowledge of the plan, is unable to speak of it to anyone else. At She-Hulk&#x27;s time trial, it was revealed that her actions made a destructive event called the Reckoning War possible. However, comments made by the future Southpaw, divulge that the war, though a terrible and dark time, will be favorably resolved.

A permanently de-powered Jennifer Walters finds that tourists from an alternate universe – designated the Alpha universe – are crossing into her universe – which they call Beta – to gain access to superpowers and comes face to face with her own powered-up doppelganger. Jennifer confirms that her Alpha counterpart slept with the Juggernaut but her anger quickly turns to sorrow as she realizes that without her abilities, the Alpha Jennifer Walters – while unfamiliar with superhuman law – is far better suited to life in the Beta universe. Realizing this, she decides that she will go to the Alpha universe and let the other Jennifer Walters take over for her.

As she steps through the portal, Reed Richards realizes he can use the previously stored configuration of the Alpha She-Hulk to restore Jennifer&#x27;s powers by purging the nanites from her body and setting the teleporter to loop her back to this reality. Having regained her abilities, Jennifer remains in her home reality, while the Alpha Jen Walters returns to her own universe and reconciles with her boyfriend, the Alpha Augustus &quot;Pug&quot; Pugliese.

At an unspecified time after &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, She-Hulk assists Tony Stark with Emil Blonsky&#x27;s murder investigation. While in Stark&#x27;s Helicarrier, she is attacked and beaten by the Red Hulk who states to her that he&#x27;s not Bruce. She-Hulk vows to get even for the deliberate humiliation. She later helps to prevent casualties in San Francisco after the Red Hulk caused an earthquake in the area, and assembles Thundra and the Valkyrie together to capture him.

Some months after regaining her abilities, Jennifer was tasked to defend an accused killer named Arthur Moore. While she was successful in defending him, immediately after his freedom was secured he claimed to be guilty and showed her images of the crimes he had been accused of. Jennifer&#x27;s horror at what she was being shown, combined with Moore&#x27;s gloating, was enough to push her rage so far that she became the savage She-Hulk once again. She attacked him and threatened to kill him if he was not given the death penalty. She also told everybody within earshot that he was guilty and backed up her accusation by revealing privileged information. This resulted in her being disbarred. Jennifer later found out that Moore really &quot;was&quot; innocent; the images he had shown her had been false. It was also revealed, albeit not to Jennifer, that Moore had hoped to get her to react exactly the way she did since his employers wanted She-Hulk disbarred for purposes as yet unknown. Unable to practice law any more, Jennifer began working for Freeman Bonds Inc. – a subsidiary of GLK&amp;B – as a bounty hunter with her Skrull partner Jazinda.

She was later recruited by Stark as a member of an Initiative-sponsored incarnation of the Defenders for a short while until Tony Stark disbanded the team. Afterwards, she continued to aid team leader Nighthawk for a brief time until she was fully able to join the team on Nighthawk&#x27;s request and that it would be away from the Initiative.

Together they have several adventures, even encountering Hercules, but they soon ended up involved in the midst of the Secret Invasion.

===&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;===
During the Skrull takeover of Earth during &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, She-Hulk and Jazinda hunt down a member of the Skrulls who functions as their religious leader. X-Factor initially impedes her progress, but they part ways on uncertain terms. She-Hulk and Jazinda capture the Skrull and the two heroines take the Skrull to New York, where they encounter the Super-Skrull, Kl&#x27;rt. Kl&#x27;rt came to kill his daughter, Jazinda, going so far as to shoot her in the head. Due to her regenerative properties, Jazinda was still not fully dead. The Skrull religious leader wants to completely remove her regenerative ability, but Kl&#x27;rt stops him after She-Hulk pleads to his fatherly nature, tapping into his guilt for not being able to save his son who had died in a previous war.

===Lady Liberators===
Some time after the Skrull invasion is defeated, the country of Marinmer suffers a devastating earthquake. Because the victims of the earthquake are members of a minority religious group, the Marinmer government has confiscated all humanitarian aid packages, and because of Marinmer&#x27;s strong ties to powerful countries such as Russia and China, other nations refuse to intervene for fear of sparking a war. She-Hulk and several members of the Lady Liberators secretly enter Marinmer, intending to steal the confiscated aid packages and distribute them to the earthquake victims. The Winter Guard attempts to stop them, but gives up after seeing the plight of the earthquake victims. Afterwards, the US government attempts to arrest She-Hulk for her actions in Marinmer, but drops the charges to avoid political embarrassment. With public opinion overwhelmingly in her favor, She-Hulk seems poised to get her legal license back when Jazinda is captured by the Behemoth after he mistakenly attacks her, thinking she is the real She-Hulk. Jazinda is then taken to a government lab and brutally experimented on when her ability to resurrect herself from the dead is discovered. Jazinda contacts She-Hulk telepathically through a secretly implanted mind reading device and warns her that the government will be coming to question her about their relationship. Jazinda tells She-Hulk to say she did not know Jazinda was a Skrull and just before going dead/unconscious tells She-Hulk &quot;I&#x27;ve always l...&quot;. She-Hulk tries to keep up the denial, but when she sees Jazinda about to be vivisected, she loses control and breaks Jazinda out. The Behemoth tries to stop her, but She-Hulk defeats him with the help of the Lady Liberators. Later it is revealed that Mallory Book, her former boss, was behind all the bad things happening to She-Hulk along with a group called the &quot;Fourth Wall&quot;. Yet when she saw She-Hulk risk herself to save her Skrull friend, Book &quot;cancelled&quot; the plan.

===&quot;Dark Reign&quot;===
In the four-issue miniseries &quot;All-New Savage She-Hulk&quot;, Jennifer fights Lyra, the alternate reality daughter of Hulk and Thundra after she comes to the Earth-616 reality for the DNA of the strongest man. While Jennifer and Lyra were fighting, Sentry tosses her away believing the man Lyra is referring to is him. She-Hulk later returns, enraged, and pummels the Sentry into the ground. She then helps Lyra escape from Avengers Tower.

===M.I.A.===
In &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; #600, Jennifer tasks Ben Urich to discover the identity of Red Hulk. She informs him that she is unable to as she has asked too many questions to the wrong people. She has Urich bring a photographer (Peter Parker), and meets him along with her insider, Doc Samson, and they venture into a S.H.I.E.L.D. base that is actually a front for A.I.M. and General Ross&#x27;s Gamma Power Super Soldier Program. Leonard Samson then appears to have a breakdown, but in reality he is changing into Samson. Samson claims to be stronger and faster (and is larger in size, has longer hair and a lightning bolt scar) than Jennifer. The clashing duo are subdued by MODOK and the facility explodes in the aftermath of a fight between Red Hulk and Hulk; Jennifer, Samson (who has reverted to Leonard) and Red Hulk are caught in the explosion. Jennifer&#x27;s status is unknown and Red Hulk does not reveal anything to Urich when the two meet a second time.

While She-Hulk is M.I.A., the Red She-Hulk makes her first appearance where she claims Jennifer Walters to be dead.

It was later shown in a flashback that Red She-Hulk prevented Jennifer Walters from escaping from A.I.M. custody. During this battle, Red She-Hulk brutally beat Jennifer and snapped her neck with a cable. In the last panel, Jennifer Walters appeared to be dead with the Red She-Hulk standing over her body, though the Red She-Hulk claims she did not know her own strength. She then questions Doc Samson whether it was the real She-Hulk or a Life-Model Decoy, to which Samson answers &quot;You&#x27;re here to follow orders, not to ask questions&quot;. Lyra later infiltrates the Intelligencia, where she finds Jennifer in stasis. Following a brief fight with the Red She-Hulk, the three decide to team up to take down Intelligencia&#x27;s forces.

===&quot;Incredible Hulks&quot;===
Following the defeat of the Intelligencia, Jennifer begins traveling with her cousin Bruce, Skaar, Korg, Rick Jones, and Betty Ross. Shortly after the events of World War Hulks, Skaar becomes aware that his brother Hiro-Kala is approaching and that he intends to crash the planet K&#x27;ai into the Earth. She-Hulk is on the team as they manage to successfully avert disaster. Upon returning to Earth, they find the world in flames as it is in the grasp of the Chaos War. They journey to Hell, where they fight and defeat the Chaos King. Returning to a restored Earth, they are greeted as monsters.

At some point before or after these events, Jennifer and Lyra settle in New York, where Lyra begins to attend high school in an attempt to gain an understanding of humanity as it occurs in this timeline. As well as helping to integrate Lyra into society, they are also involved in trying to round up the remaining members of the Intelligencia.

They manage to round up the Intelligencia, but the Wizard is able to escape imprisonment and goes after Lyra at her high school prom, almost killing her before She-Hulk intervenes, knocking out Wizard but not before Lyra&#x27;s secret identity has been compromised. The rest of the pupils turn on Lyra as a result of her prom date being injured and the endangerment of everyone at the dance. She-Hulk explains to her afterwards that they have to leave and that despite being heroes, the life of a Hulk is often lonely.

===Fearsome Four===
During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, She-Hulk joins with Howard the Duck, Nighthawk and the Frankenstein Monster to form a four-person team called the Fearsome Four to stop the Man-Thing from its destructive path. They later discover a plot by Psycho-Man to use the Man-Thing&#x27;s volatile empathy to create a weapon.

===Future Foundation===
Prior to a time- and multiverse-spanning trip by the Fantastic Four and family, the Thing asks She-Hulk to be a member of the Future Foundation.

===Doc Green===
When the Hulk is elevated into &quot;Doc Green&quot; – a version of the Hulk possessing Bruce Banner&#x27;s intellect – after he is treated for a shot to the head as Bruce Banner by use of the Extremis virus, he sets out to attack and depower other gamma-based mutates. Steve Rogers attempts to order the Hulk to stop before he goes after She-Hulk, but when Doc Green finally confronts her, he instead admits that he has come to recognize that he is coming dangerously close to the Maestro, as part of him enjoyed eliminating his &#x27;rivals&#x27;, having decided instead to accept the eventual loss of his intellect as Extremis wore off rather than risk that persona emerging. Informing She-Hulk that she is the only gamma mutation whose life he felt had been legitimately enhanced by her condition, Doc Green provides her with the last injection of his cure, asking her to use it on him if he goes too far in his efforts to stop an A.I. version of himself that he created and unleashed.

===Gwenpool===
In Gwenpool&#x27;s first Christmas special, Howard the Duck invited her to She-Hulk&#x27;s Christmas party on the proviso that she has not killed any good guys recently. She shows up and karaokes with Ms. Marvel. Also there was a one-shot image of her holding mistletoe over her head and inviting She-Hulk to kiss her while Ms. Marvel looked on in girlish glee. There were dozens of superhumans in attendance, proving that whether she is acting as a hero or not, She-Hulk keeps strong ties to the super-community.

===&quot;Civil War II&quot;===
During the 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, after the Inhuman Ulysses predicts Thanos&#x27; arrival on Earth, She-Hulk was mortally wounded by a direct attack from the villain in question. When Iron Man learns that they used Ulysses&#x27; precognitive power to ambush Thanos, he vows to make sure that no one uses it again. Before She-Hulk goes into cardiac arrest, she tells Captain Marvel to fight for the future. After Hawkeye was acquitted for shooting Bruce Banner, Captain Marvel visited She-Hulk, who came out of her coma. When She-Hulk angrily demanded to know the verdict of Hawkeye&#x27;s trial, Captain Marvel remained silent.

===Post-&quot;Civil War II&quot;===
Following Bruce Banner&#x27;s funeral, Jennifer Walters left the superhero business and continued to work as a lawyer, where she gained her first client: Maise Brewn, who was an Inhuman descendant. Due to the stress following the fight with Thanos, Jennifer started turning uncontrollably into her version of the Grey Hulk at different intervals. Jennifer helped Maise when she was recovering from the trauma and being evicted by her landlord Mr. Tick. When Maise got impatient with Jennifer and summoned a Fear Golem that killed Mr. Tick and some police officers, Jennifer is nearly killed by it and transforms into the Hulk. She defeated the Fear Golem and prevented Maise from committing suicide when Maise was arrested for reckless endangerment afterwards.

Afterwards, Jennifer transformed into the Hulk and met the Hellcat. After changing back, Jennifer told Hellcat that she was worried over the fact that her grey color could mean that she is like Bruce (since Bruce also had a grey incarnation). Later, Jennifer was watching a live video on the internet when a baker named Oliver turned into a Hulk-like creature on-camera. Jennifer spent several days trying to track him down, eventually confronting him as the Hulk at the Brooklyn Bridge. During the following battle, she lost control of her Hulk persona, almost killing him, though the Hellcat managed to calm her down. However, the incident left Jennifer worried about losing control again.

Some time later, the Leader kidnapped Jennifer and forced her to transform into the Hulk and attempt to kill his new assistant, Robyn, who willingly went through a blood transfusion to become a Hulk-like monster herself. The Hulk nearly killed Robyn, but Jennifer managed to regain control, before defeating the Leader by electrocuting him. Jen then went with self-help writer Florida Mayer, who used a special pill to transport Jennifer to her subconscious, leading her to confront her Hulk persona and illusions of Thanos and Banner, finally overcoming her trauma in the process. Upon waking, Jennifer reverted to her standard green She-Hulk persona.

During the war against the Cotati, She-Hulk is revealed to have been killed and replaced by a Cotati, attacking the Avengers when they tried to negotiate a truce with their new enemy, the heroes only surviving the attack thanks to the Invisible Woman&#x27;s forcefield, although the Cotati/She-Hulk then beats down the Thing and retreats. Invisible Woman, Mantis, and Thing are locked in combat with the Cotati-possessed She-Hulk. Back in New York, Jo-Venn and N&#x27;kalla release their positive memories which revives She-Hulk enough to break the Cotati off of her and to stop the fighting between the Kree and the Skrull. When the Cotati are defeated, She-Hulk and Thor take Sequoia away. It turns out that She-Hulk was able to return to life thanks to Leader who has mastered the way to control the Green Door.

===Dating Jack of Hearts===
After Jennifer managed to get her mind back in order, she decided to try to reassemble her life and professional career again, and was hired by her old rival Mallory Book, and Mallory&#x27;s romantic and professional partner Awesome Andy, to handle legal representation and counselling for other superhumans. To help Jennifer, her good friend Janet van Dyne, The Wasp, also gave her a spacious new apartment. During this time Jennifer also made peace with her old foe Titania (although they decided to keep each others as regular sparring partners under lawful circumstances), and she gradually entered a romantic relationship with her old teammate Jack of Hearts. April, a scientist with intelligence enhanced by gamma-radiation, and her superhumanly strong husband Mark, also sought to drain She-Hulk of her powers to stabilize their own mutations. They failed in their attempt, but as a result Jack lost control over his powers to a sufficient degree to automatically drain Jennifer of her powers if they physically touch each other, so their relationship had to turn platonic from that point. Further complicating the situation, a charming and vastly super-humanly strong thief calling himself The Scoundrel began to actively flirt with She-Hulk during her attempts to apprehend him, but she completely rejected him after finding him morally reprehensible.

==Characterization==
===Powers and abilities===
A transfusion of gamma-irradiated blood from her cousin Bruce Banner (the Hulk) granted Jennifer Walters superhuman powers. In her She-Hulk form, she possesses enormous superhuman strength, that potentially makes her the physically strongest known woman in the Marvel Universe when her emotional state is sufficiently high.

Although She-Hulk&#x27;s strength originally remained at a set level and did not increase, later in her history her strength has been stated to increase further from fear, or anger, similarly to her cousin. In addition the character possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and reflexes.

As She-Hulk, Walters is exponentially stronger than she is in her Jennifer Walters form; therefore any extra strength gained as Jennifer Walters through intense physical training will be amplified, making her She-Hulk form even stronger. After being defeated by the Champion of the Universe, She-Hulk exercised for several months in her Jennifer Walters form, resulting in a significant gain in strength and muscular mass in her She-Hulk form and allowing her to soundly defeat the Champion in a rematch. At this time she was able to effortlessly sustain the Thing&#x27;s maximum weight with a single arm, while her strength was greatly restrained by a &quot;Jupiter suit,&quot; and she was shown as considerably stronger than Hercules. Similarly to her cousin, her powers can also greatly increase by absorbing radiation. She is capable of absorbing great amounts of energy, and used this ability to absorb the uncontrolled energy of the new Starbrand.

She-Hulk received a power upgrade from Eson, the Celestial, and became more powerful than ever before, far surpassing Captain Marvel and even Thor (without the Odinforce) in strength. A Cotati-possessed She-Hulk nearly killed the Thing with her bare hands and punched through the Invisible Woman&#x27;s force fields without even noticing the efforts by Susan Richards to protect her teammate.

She-Hulk&#x27;s body is superhumanly durable and nearly impervious to force, pain, and disease: her skin can withstand extremes of temperature, as well as tremendous stresses and impacts without puncture wounds or lacerations. Her enhanced physiology renders her immune to all terrestrial diseases. She-Hulk also possesses a healing factor, which enabled her to completely recover, within minutes, from a skewering by the Wendigo.

Due to training from the alien Ovoids, She-Hulk is able to swap powers and physiques with other human women, but retains her green skin pigmentation, and only used it once.

Due to the Hulk&#x27;s wish, Jennifer can now switch between her human and Hulk forms at will.

For a time, thanks to a hex cast by the Scarlet Witch, anyone who wished She-Hulk harm could not recognize her as Jennifer, but harmful side effects forced Jennifer to seek the assistance of Doctor Strange to remove the hex.

She-Hulk is described as a living gamma bomb and is capable of accidentally causing huge explosions, &quot;beyond what even Hulk can produce&quot;. She described herself as an Omega level threat, and claimed that the Starbrand is one of Earth&#x27;s inherent defense systems, much like herself.

====Skills====
She-Hulk is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by Captain America and Gamora. Even in her Jennifer Walters form, she possesses sufficient skill in the martial arts to dispatch several would-be muggers much larger than she is. She once displayed sufficient knowledge of acupressure to render the Abomination insensate by striking several nerve clusters after first using psychology to distract him.

She-Hulk is also a skilled and experienced attorney who attended the UCLA School of Law, where she was a member of the Order of the Coif, a national merit society for top legal scholars. She-Hulk had performed legal work as a member of the Magistrati, who had the power to compel her to adjudicate cases anywhere in creation. She ceased to operate in this function after successfully adjudicating the merits of her own universe to continue existing (opposed by the Ultimate Marvel Universe) before the Living Tribunal.

She is a skilled pilot and has previously used a modified 1995 Dodge automobile equipped with technology enabling flight in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and in outer space for limited distances, although it is incapable of interstellar flight.

===Personality===
The character&#x27;s personality has changed over the decades since her first appearance: originally ill-tempered and violent, she is now depicted as a fun-loving, extremely kind, empathetic, yet still feisty woman who frequently uses humor when fighting. She has stated that she does not want to kill her foes, especially ones which she has already subdued.

She has also started and led her own disaster relief organization, and felt great remorse for almost destroying a small town (due to her transformed state briefly turning uncontrollable from radiation), whereupon she helped construction workers to rebuild it.

As a highly idealistic lawyer, the character has a history of defending the rights of minorities, the mentally ill, civil liberties, including the right for criminals to not be unduly mistreated and get a proper defense, or individuals to not be victimized by unethical corporations, but also a belief in the necessity of law and order. These priorities have sometimes made her personally conflicted, such as reversing her stance regarding the Superhuman Registration Act; and being disillusioned when her more famous cousin (whom she considers as a brother) was shot into space without due process, or when what she thought to be a torturer and murderer of children was cleared from all charges.

Jennifer has enormous amounts of determination and willpower that allowed her to resist systematic torture and brainwashing at the hands of the Red Widow for several weeks without having her personality or idealism affected in the slightest.

When the Time Variance Authority put She-Hulk on trial to potentially erase her from history, Bruce Banner testified that, as a curse on himself and humanity, there are days when he feels like the only thing that has made his life worthwhile is that he did not only save the life of somebody he loves when he gave Jennifer his blood, but also had a hand in creating a genuine hero.

In an interview, former &quot;She-Hulk&quot; writer Peter David described her as follows:

Unlike Hulk, Jennifer&#x27;s personality and intelligence are less affected when she transforms into She-Hulk, although she becomes more self-confident and assertive. In court it was proven that her mutated form also has fewer inhibitions, as proven during a trial for the Leader; for example, while Jennifer Walters has only had a few sexual partners, reading back a list of She-Hulk&#x27;s conquests took considerable time. For a long time, She-Hulk could not revert to her original human form, but that turned out to be psychosomatic due to her not actually wanting to.

===Breaking the fourth wall===

For a time, starting with the &quot;Sensational She-Hulk&quot; series by John Byrne in 1989, She-Hulk was portrayed with a form of &quot;cross-dimensional&quot; or metafictional awareness to break the fourth wall. In some stories, she showed an awareness of being a comic book character, with visuals of her &quot;tearing the page&quot; or &quot;walking through a page of advertisements&quot; to reach an enemy&#x27;s control center. She sometimes engaged in arguments with the writer (John Byrne), or appealed to the comic&#x27;s editor, Renée Witterstaetter. &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; #50 (Byrne&#x27;s last issue) involved Renée locking a bound-and-gagged Byrne in a storage closet while she and Jen tried to find the book&#x27;s new writer. This trend was briefly carried on during her tenure with the Heroes for Hire, when she &quot;spoke&quot; to the book&#x27;s narrator and &quot;fired&quot; him for losing the plot. Other Marvel characters that have been written to directly &quot;address&quot; the audience include She-Hulk&#x27;s friend Louise Mason, Uatu the Watcher (who narrates a majority of the issues of &quot;What If&quot; by speaking directly to the reader), and Deadpool. On occasion, this practice has also been used for Loki, Rick Jones, Wyatt Wingfoot, and Howard the Duck. The Dan Slott series has not acknowledged this primarily-humor-based quirk of She-Hulk&#x27;s, save for a coda in vol. 2 #3 (#100), in which Stu Cicero, a law firm &quot;researcher&quot; asks Jen if she can &quot;really do stuff like that.&quot; She somewhat wistfully replies &quot;No. I can&#x27;t&quot; – however, the panel is drawn at a somewhat ambiguous angle that suggests She-Hulk may be looking &quot;out&quot; of the comic at the reader. She-Hulk&#x27;s most recent profile in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; continues to list this &quot;ability&quot; of hers, and confirms that she is simply downplaying it for the benefit of those around her.

The Dan Slott series took a different approach to the metafiction angle, making use of a concept dating back to Lee and Kirby&#x27;s early &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; – that the heroes of the Marvel Universe permit licensed comic-book adaptations of their adventures to be published. Since all comics published before 2001 bear the seal of the Comics Code Authority of America (a federal agency in the Marvel Universe), they are considered legal documents admissible as evidence in the superhuman law cases on which She-Hulk works.

In much more recent appearances She-Hulk has demonstrated that she still has the ability to exit her narrative and talk directly with her readers.

===Relationships===
She-Hulk&#x27;s relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance. These needs were evident in her often-tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters. A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental. In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.

Sheriff Walters felt that the best way for Jennifer to live was for her to follow his values. However, Jennifer grew up perceiving the gray areas of law enforcement (for example, she interpreted the events leading up to riots which occurred during her childhood differently from her father). Although Jennifer saw her decision to become a criminal defense attorney as a kind of homage to her father, Sheriff Walters instead interpreted her choice (to defend criminals) as a rejection of his values.

Jennifer worked at nurturing a supportive relationship with her father, and remained close to a childhood friend, Zapper, with whom she ultimately became romantically involved. Being She-Hulk allowed Jennifer to express emotions which she was not otherwise comfortable revealing. For example, although Jennifer Walters was restrained from dating a younger man, as She-Hulk she felt free to express her affection for Zapper. During that same time, Jennifer pursued a problematic relationship with the affable ne&#x27;er-do-well Richard Rory (a supporting character created by Steve Gerber for the Man-Thing stories), who actually valued her for who she really was.

Ultimately, She-Hulk&#x27;s relationship with Zapper fell apart, primarily due to her insistence on permanently remaining in her She-Hulk form, eschewing the Jennifer Walters persona that Zapper had grown up with. Zapper believed that Jennifer&#x27;s preference represented a rejection of her true self. Although in actuality She-Hulk liberated much of Jennifer Walters&#x27; repressed personality, the She-Hulk persona also repressed certain aspects of Jennifer Walters&#x27; personality which She-Hulk found distasteful.

During her time as an Avenger, She-Hulk engaged in a relationship with Starfox. This encounter was later retold in flashback, and in that storyline, Starfox was on trial, charged with sexually assaulting a married woman. The alleged victim testified that Starfox&#x27;s euphoria power had forced her to be sexually forward, similarly to She-Hulk&#x27;s own encounter with Starfox. Jennifer assumed that her interaction with Starfox had not been consensual after hearing this testimony, after which she severely battered him, including kicking him in the groin. However, she later discovered that Starfox had not used his powers on her, and that his brother Thanos had manipulated his mind to make him use his powers recklessly and plant falsely incriminating memories there.

It was also during her Avengers tenure that she met and became fast friends with her teammate Janet van Dyne, who would become a huge influence on She-Hulk&#x27;s personal development by encouraging her to adopt a more free-going lifestyle, and even help her in times of need. When the Wasp was temporarily killed by the Wrecking Crew during the first Secret War, She-Hulk impulsively stormed off to avenge her, only to nearly fall victim herself to the Wrecking Crew, the Absorbing Man, Titania and Doctor Octopus.

She-Hulk was briefly engaged to the younger Wyatt Wingfoot, whom she first met during her tenure with the Fantastic Four. She let her guard down with Wyatt, expressing her vulnerabilities as Wyatt supported her during a series of traumatic events. A paparazzo took photos of her sunbathing topless (but nobody ultimately knew it was She-Hulk due to an unwitting editor &#x27;correcting&#x27; her green skin). Later, corrupt agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. forced her to strip naked and be medically examined as a &quot;potential threat like her cousin&quot;. This was all filmed for personal arousal purposes, before Dum Dum Dugan put a stop to the harassment. Although She-Hulk put forward a brave exterior during those incidents, she was actually quite shaken and appreciated Wyatt&#x27;s support.

Although She-Hulk deeply values close emotional ties with family, friends, and lovers, she seldom admits the depth of her need for these attachments. For example, years after her mother died, Jennifer could not move on from the family home. Even when her father moved out, Jennifer would not leave her family memories behind. The Avengers and Fantastic Four became surrogate families for her; she forged strong bonds with them.

She-Hulk was married to John Jameson, whom she first met while he was the Man-Wolf in a Microverse adventure in &quot;The Savage She-Hulk&quot;. The two precipitously eloped in Las Vegas. The two shared an apartment with She-Hulk&#x27;s colleague, Augustus &quot;Pug&quot; Pugliese, who holds an unspoken (but obvious) crush on her. Pug correctly deduced that both the suddenness of She-Hulk&#x27;s strengthened feelings for Jameson, as well as the pair&#x27;s marriage, were the result of manipulation by Starfox. Due to his efforts to prove this, She-Hulk and John became aware of Pug&#x27;s crush just as John was forced to become the Man-Wolf once more.

She-Hulk&#x27;s passion for John has cooled since Starfox&#x27;s &quot;love zap&quot; was removed. However, John was never zapped, and his deep love for Jennifer Walters has been confirmed (John has stated a preference for She-Hulk in her human form). She-Hulk&#x27;s reaction to John as the Man-Wolf/the Stargod has not been positive. The marriage has been annulled.

She-Hulk had a date with Power Man while both were on the Heroes for Hire team. She resisted dating an &quot;ex-con&quot;, but after a scuffle with Titania and the Absorbing Man where Cage aided her, she reconsidered. The relationship never developed, but a friendship between them was formed.

After Jennifer broke up with John Jameson (but before he signed the annulment) she had flings with Clay Quartermain and Tony Stark, and even made a pass at Wolverine. Wolverine rebuffs her, saying he has no wish to &quot;chase after Juggernaut&#x27;s .&quot; She-Hulk repeatedly vehemently denies sleeping with the Juggernaut (as a wanted criminal who has attempted to murder her cousin), despite the two previously being shown in bed together. It is revealed that the Juggernaut had, in fact, bedded a She-Hulk from an alternate universe. An out of continuity tongue-in-cheek mini-chapter later spoofs this, by jokingly showing the two characters as passionately in love.

Perhaps her longest crush is on Hercules, about whom she has repeatedly dreamt. However, after fighting demons together, she rebuffs Hercules&#x27; advances, seeing him as a muscle-bound oaf. After Hercules jovially smacks her bottom, She-Hulk sends him through a brick wall, and says she will relegate the idea of a relationship with him to fantasy, as she finds the reality disappointing. Despite this, years afterwards they eventually sleep together.

Jennifer has also been in prolonged romantic relationships with Thor, and Jack of Hearts.

Her relationship with Jack has been notable in that Jennifer has managed to keep it almost entirely non-physical, and based solely on love and trust, due to Jack&#x27;s usually uncontrolled ability to absorb energy from his surroundings, including from herself.

She-Hulk has many friends in the superhuman community, most of whom showed up for her Christmas party in the 2015 &quot;Gwenpool Special&quot;.

Jennifer&#x27;s best friend is Patsy Walker.

===Costumes===
Due to her affiliation with different supergroups over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous costumes. She-Hulk&#x27;s personality has also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious.

Because of her various outfit changes, no single costume can be considered iconic (compared to Superman&#x27;s blue and red tights, or Spider-Man&#x27;s red and blue costume and mask). However, She-Hulk is immediately recognizable due to her size, green skin, and long, dark green, almost black hair.

In her first appearance, She-Hulk was a massive, towering figure, with wild, untamed, waist-length hair. She wore a ragged white dress or blouse (the dress ripping and tearing as Walters turned into her giant alter ego). That white garment, which was often only the blouse that Walters had on before her transformation, always covered her upper body and midsection (in the same way that enough of the Hulk&#x27;s pants survived to cover him after his transformations). When she was asked about this in an early issue of the second series, Jennifer responded that her clothes carry the label of the Comics Code.

After her &quot;Savage&quot; era, She-Hulk wore appropriately sized clothes. For instance, she joined the Avengers and began dressing in a one-piece aerobics outfit. During the Avengers era, she wore a purple, one-piece swimsuit with a white belt and boots.

After the first of the Secret Wars, She-Hulk took the place of the Thing and became a full-fledged member of the Fantastic Four. Her costume kept the sleeveless/legless leotard design, incorporating the colors and style of the team&#x27;s costumes, with a &quot;4&quot; prominently displayed across her chest and white gloves and boots. After leaving the Fantastic Four, she rejoined the Avengers, donning a white one-piece costume with the blue Avengers insignia emblazoned on it.

She-Hulk has then worn a purple and white one-piece leotard, complemented by fingerless gloves and sneakers. Her hair is long and straight, as opposed to the thick, curly tresses she sported in the past. After the events of World War Hulk, she has added baggy low-rise jeans to this look.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Critical response===
Jenna Anderson of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; wrote, &quot;Although she has had a slew of different comic interpretations over the years, John Byrne&#x27;s take on her in &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; is often regarded as the most iconic – both for further developing her as a character, and for satirizing the comic book tropes of the time. In the decades since, She-Hulk has consistently remained spirited and feisty, but also incredibly intelligent, empathetic, and altruistic, both in her life as a superhero and as a lawyer.&quot; Deidre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called She-Hulk a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character. Peyton Hinckle of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; referred to She-Hulk as a female role model, saying, &quot;As a strong, self-confident woman who completely ignores female stereotypes, she&#x27;s the kind of character more people — especially younger readers — need to see. She happily accepts the things that make her different and she doesn&#x27;t try to hide herself just because others disapprove. She struggles with things too, but at the end of the day, she proves that with the right thinking, anything is possible. For male and female comic readers alike, that&#x27;s an important message.&quot;

Alyssa Rosenberg of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called She-Hulk a &quot;feminist superhero,&quot; stating, &quot;From the very start, She-Hulk was recognizable as a manifestation of a particularly female dilemma that persists today. She is an expression of how terrific it would be not to have to censor yourself, to be allowed to be angry without some man declaring you unladylike. [...] She-Hulk is not a male fantasy of how sexual liberation works, where women focus more on making men happy than on their own pleasure. Rather, she is an adventuress with a clear sense of her own gratification and joy.&quot; &quot;UGO Networks&quot; included She-Hulk in their &quot;Best Heroes of All Time&quot; list, writing, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s a cheap cross-marketing ploy about She-hulk [...] If nothing else, she has proven to have a longer shelf life than Spider-Woman (who is also in no way a cheap marketing ploy).&quot; Dan Van Winkle of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; included She-Hulk in their &quot;7 Female Superheroes Who Should Join Marvel’s Cinematic Universe&quot; list, calling her one of the &quot;women superheroes we would love to see make their way into the MCU.&quot; Chris Arrant of &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked She-Hulk 8th in their &quot;Best Marvel Characters of All Time&quot; list, saying, &quot;From the novel idea of a lawyer specializing in superhero law to a successful businesswoman dealing with the realities (and fiction) of controlling (or not controlling) her anger issues, She-Hulk isn&#x27;t a cliché or an archetype, which makes her one of top characters in the Marvel U. 

Jo-Anne Rowney of &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ranked She-Hulk 8th in their &quot;Best Female Superheroes of All Time&quot; list. Aaron Young of &quot;Looper&quot; ranked She-Hulk 10th in their &quot;Strongest Superheroes In History&quot; list. Rob Bricken of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; ranked She-Hulk 16th in their &quot;Every Member Of The Avengers&quot; list. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked She-Hulk 18th in their &quot;Top 50 Avengers&quot; list, and 88th in their &quot;100 Comic Book Heroes&quot; list, asserting, &quot;Plenty of heroes have gained female sidekicks over the years, but few of these ladies have so capably managed to escape the shadow of their namesakes as She-Hulk. Where Hulk is merely an outlet for Bruce Banner&#x27;s rage and pain, She-Hulk is pure liberation for the geeky, mousy Jennifer Walters. This gamma gal has an impressive track record in comics, and we&#x27;re waiting for her to join her cousin on the big screen.&quot; Darren French of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked She-Hulk 19th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s Rank Every Avenger Ever&quot; list. &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; ranked She-Hulk 11th in their &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list. &quot;Wizard&quot; ranked She-Hulk 104th in their &quot;200 comic book characters&quot; list.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; included She-Hulk in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Lawyers In Comics&quot; list, and ranked her 3rd in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Members Of The Lady Liberators&quot; list, and 13th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Members Of The Avengers&quot; list. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked She-Hulk 1st in their &quot;Marvel: The 10 Strongest Female Heroes&quot; list, 2nd in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Lawyers In Marvel Comics&quot; list, 3rd in their &quot;20 Strongest Female Superheroes&quot; list, 5th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Members Of The Fantastic Four&quot; list, 5th in their &quot;A-Force: 10 Most Powerful Members Of The All-Female Avengers Team&quot; list, 7th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Female Members Of The Avengers&quot; list, 8th in their &quot;10 Most Attractive Marvel Heroes&quot; list, 9th in their &quot;10 Scariest Avengers&quot; list, 10th in their &quot;10 Most Fashionable Marvel Heroes&quot; list, and 19th in their &quot;25 Most Powerful Avengers&quot; list.

===Impact===
In January 2016, She-Hulk was ranked 18th in the &quot;Top 100 Marvel Characters&quot; list across a popularity contest held by &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot;. 

==Literary reception==
===Volumes===
====&quot;She-Hulk&quot; (2014)====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 was the 36th best selling comic book in February 2014.

Kelly Thompson of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 a &quot;strong opening for a character well deserving of the spotlight,&quot; asserting, &quot;Overall, &quot;&quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 is a great start to a new series for a character well deserving of the spotlight. If Soule can find a way to better balance the lawyer element of the book by sprinkling in a bit more action, he and Pulido are likely to have a hit on their hands.&quot; Benjamin Bailey of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 a grade of 9.8 out of 10, writing, &quot;This is not a superhero book. Not even a little bit. It&#x27;s more Hawkeye than Hulk, following the stories of Jennifer Walters&#x27;s law career – or lack of career, as the book starts – and what she does when she&#x27;s not an Avenger or member of the FF. In other words, this is a comic that could have gone really bad really fast. In the wrong hands, this thing could have been a boring, bizarre mess. Fortunately, due to the very capable Charles Soule and Javier Pulido, that is not the case. In fact, &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 is absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s the She-Hulk comic we never knew we needed.&quot;

====&quot;She-Hulk&quot; (Marvel Legacy) (2017)====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #159 was the 48th best selling comic book in November 2017.

Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;She-Hulk&quot; #159 was a pleasantly surprising read. The story was gripping, if a bit slow. We don&#x27;t get to see Jen fully She-Hulk out, but she is a likable enough character that I was fine just reading about her. Hellcat has a great presence in the comic too, and the read was overall compelling. I recommend it. Check it out.&quot; Joe Garza of &quot;SlashFilm&quot; included &quot;She-Hulk #159&quot; in their &quot;15 Best She-Hulk Comics You Need To Read&quot; list, asserting, &quot;The Leader has always been a great villain for the Hulk — and this storyline proves that he&#x27;s just as great against She-Hulk — as he&#x27;s typically forced into using his immense intellect to best a foe who relies on brute force. However, this story shines as an exploration of PTSD. During this time in the Marvel Comics universe, Bruce Banner was dead (only to return, of course), and the heroes had been rocked by a lasting status quo shakeup, She-Hulk included. This storyline saw her dealing with loss and identity in a way rarely seen before in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; comics, and it&#x27;s handled with all of the grace (and punching) it deserves.&quot;

====&quot;Immortal She-Hulk&quot; (2020)====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Immortal She-Hulk&quot; #1 was the 17th best selling comic book in September 2020.

Oscar Maltby of &quot;Newsarama&quot; described &quot;Immortal She-Hulk&quot; #1 as an &quot;emotionally weighty one-shot,&quot; stating, &quot;&quot;Immortal She-Hulk&quot; #1 is a tie-in trapped between two worlds. Directly picking up in the fallout of Empyre but with roots much deeper than that summer event, Ewing and Davis-Hunt offer up an accomplished one-shot that is one third a retrospective, one third a philosophical piece on the nature of immortality, and one third a short but potent chapter in Ewing&#x27;s Immortal Hulk saga.&quot; Sam Stone of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; said, &quot;&quot;The Immortal She-Hulk&quot; #1 provides a welcome window into Jennifer Walters&#x27; psyche as she grapples her own mortality and place in the Marvel Universe. While positioning She-Hulk for a bigger role in the main &quot;Immortal Hulk&quot; series and its escalating battle against the story&#x27;s true, sinister mastermind the issue provides a nice change of pace by leaning more into introspection and character study than entirely focusing on smashing – though there is smashing to be had! For She-Hulk fans that have been looking for a less savage iteration of the character, this special one-shot issue provides them the chance to see both sides of Jennifer Walters in full.&quot; Connor Casey of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Immortal She-Hulk&quot; #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, asserting, &quot;Al Ewing brings the brilliance from his Immortal Hulk run to this Immortal She-Hulk one-shot, in which Jennifer Walters explores some of the biggest ideas that haunt comic characters from the margins. What does it mean to come back from the dead? Is immortality real or is it merely a longer life span. What happens when somebody who is immortal suddenly… isn&#x27;t? Ewing doesn&#x27;t answer every question here (how could he possibly?) but it&#x27;s fascinating to see characters like She-Hulk, Wolverine and Thor discuss these concepts.&quot;

====&quot;She-Hulk&quot; (2022)====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 was the 9th best selling comic book in January 2022.

Sayantan Gayen of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; described &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 as &quot;lighthearted story,&quot; saying, &quot;&quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 provides a rare insight into the busy civilian life of Jennifer Walters. Much of the positive tone of the issue exudes from its lead, but there is also a sense of anxiousness as Walters interacts with a new environment – a point well made by Rowell throughout the book. While the story does not have an antagonist yet, there is no sluggishness in the narrative&#x27;s pace. The story&#x27;s plot matches the speed of Jennifer&#x27;s hectic schedule. Whatever serenity Jen finds in this story quickly ends when a long-forgotten Marvel character crashes through her door, ending &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 on a shocking and rewarding cliffhanger.&quot; Joe Garza of &quot;SlashFilm&quot; included &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #1 in their &quot;15 Best She-Hulk Comics You Need To Read&quot; list, stating, &quot;This new solo series is the perfect jumping-on point for casual fans, as it establishes a whole new status quo for She-Hulk, setting the stage for adventures that aren&#x27;t beholden to past continuity. However, there are still plenty of nods to She-Hulk&#x27;s long history to keep legacy fans happy as well. It&#x27;s a back-to-basics comic that strips the character down to what made her so special in her formative years.&quot;

<text>James Howard Kunstler is an American writer, social critic, public speaker, and blogger. He is best known for his books &quot;The Geography of Nowhere&quot; (1994), a history of American suburbia and urban development, &quot;The Long Emergency&quot; (2005), and &quot;Too Much Magic&quot; (2012). In &quot;The Long Emergency&quot;, he imagines peak oil and oil depletion resulting in the end of industrialized society, forcing Americans to live in smaller-scale, localized, agrarian or semi-agrarian communities. He uses speculative fiction to portray this type of future in &quot;World Made by Hand&quot;.

==Background==
Kunstler was born in New York City to Jewish parents, who divorced when he was eight. His family then moved to the suburbs on Long Island. His biological father was a middleman in the diamond trade. Kunstler spent most of his childhood with his mother and stepfather, a publicist for Broadway shows. While spending summers at a boys&#x27; camp in New Hampshire, he became acquainted with a small town ethos that would later permeate many of his works.

He lives in Greenwich, a town in Washington County, New York.

==Education==
In 1966, Kunstler graduated from New York City&#x27;s High School of Music &amp; Art and attended the State University of New York at Brockport, where he majored in theater.

==Career==
After college, Kunstler worked as a reporter and feature writer for a number of newspapers, and finally as a staff writer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. During the 1970s and 1980s, Kunstler worked &quot;a lot of odd jobs, from orderly in the psychiatric wing of the hospital to digging holes for percolation tests in housing subdivisions&quot;.

In 1975, he began writing books and lecturing full-time. Kunstler&#x27;s blog states that he has lectured at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell, MIT, RPI, and the University of Virginia and has appeared before professional organizations such as the AIA, the APA, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Kunstler lectured on topics related to suburbia, urban development, and the challenges of what he calls &quot;the global oil predicament&quot;, and a resultant change in the &quot;American Way of Life.&quot; He lectured at the TED Conference, the American Institute of Architects, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the International Council of Shopping Centers, and the National Association of Science and Technology, as well as at numerous colleges and universities, including Yale, MIT, Harvard, Cornell, the University of Illinois, DePaul, Texas A&amp;M, the USMA, and Rutgers University.

As a journalist, Kunstler wrote articles for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;, and its op-ed page where he covered environmental and economic issues. Kunstler is also a supporter of the movement known as New Urbanism.

His career peaked with the popularising of the concept of peak oil, for which he was a prominent spokesman, such as in the 2004 documentary &quot;The End of Suburbia&quot;. His 2005 book &quot;The Long Emergency&quot; became an oft-cited reference for the predicted imminent collapse of human civilisation. However, oil supplies increased due to fracking, and the collapse did not happen during the timeframe Kunstler predicted.

==Political views==
Kunstler is a harsh critic of both the Republican Party, describing them as &quot;a gang of hypocritical, pietistic sadists, seeking pleasure in the suffering of others while pretending to be Christians, devoid of sympathy, empathy, or any inclination to simple human kindness, constant breakers of the Golden Rule, enemies of the common good.&quot; and also the Democratic Party and their &quot;underhanded attempts&quot; to get rid of Donald Trump, a man whom Kunstler sees as showing &quot;strength&quot;. He was also a promoter of the concept of a so-called &quot;deep state&quot; working to overthrow and thwart Trump. He endorsed Trump for re-election and declared that he intended to do &quot;everything he can to prevent the Democrats from winning the election.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;American Conservative&quot;, Kunstler attacked gay marriage, describing it as &quot;cultural mischief&quot; that would further damage &quot;a struggling institution&quot;. He believes that the 2020 United States presidential election was fraudulent, describing it as a &quot;fraud-inflected election&quot; on his website, and he suggests that the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol was the work of left-wing groups.

In recent times, Kunstler has had financial problems and was described as &quot;seethingly angry&quot; about his writing income falling to only a few thousand dollars annually because of &quot;the tidal wave of free content on the web&quot;. In addition, his &quot;lucrative college speaking fees&quot; have disappeared, which he blames on &quot;the rising hysteria on campus against threatening ideas&quot;. Kunstler now uses Patreon to crowdfund his writing.

In an interview with Doug Casey published on October 13, 2021, Kunstler called the COVID-19 pandemic a &quot;scam&quot;, and on October 11 he published the debunked vaccine conspiracy theory that the vaccine would kill people &quot;steadily over the weeks and months&quot; and went on to name hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as &quot;effective&quot; treatments.

==Writing==
Over the course of the first 14 years of his writing career (1979–1993), Kunstler wrote seven novels.

Since the mid-1990s, he has written four non-fiction books about suburban development and diminishing global oil supplies. According to the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, his first work on the subject, &quot;The Geography of Nowhere,&quot; discussed the effects of &quot;cartoon architecture, junked cities, and a ravaged countryside&quot;. The book was described as a jeremiad by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Kunstler is critical of suburbia and urban development trends throughout the United States and is a proponent of the New Urbanism movement. According to Scott Carlson, reporter for &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, Kunstler&#x27;s books on the subject have become &quot;standard reading in architecture and urban planning courses&quot;.

He describes America as a poorly planned and &quot;tragic landscape of highway strips, parking lots, housing tracts, mega-malls, junked cities, and ravaged countryside that makes up the everyday environment where most Americans live and work.&quot; In a 2001 op-ed for Planetizen, he wrote that in the wake of 9/11, the &quot;age of skyscrapers is at an end&quot;, that no new megatowers would be built, and that existing tall buildings are destined to be dismantled.

In his books that followed, such as &quot;Home From Nowhere&quot;, &quot;The City in Mind&quot;, and &quot;The Long Emergency&quot; (2005), he discussed topics in the context of a coming post-oil America. Kunstler says he wrote &quot;The Geography of Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Because I believe a lot of people share my feelings about the tragic landscape of highway strips, parking lots, housing tracts, mega-malls, junked cities, and ravaged countryside that makes up the everyday environment where most Americans live and work&quot;.

He envisions a future where localized agriculture and production predominate, with little reliance on imports, in his 2008 social science fiction novel &quot;World Made by Hand&quot;. Three sequels have followed: &quot;The Witch of Hebron&quot; (2010), &quot;A History of the Future&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Harrows of Spring&quot; (2016).

Kunstler has written articles for the &quot;American Conservative&quot; magazine.

In his writings and lectures, he contends that there is no other alternative energy source on the horizon that can replace petroleum. He therefore envisions a &quot;low energy&quot; world that will be radically different from today&#x27;s. This has contributed to his becoming an outspoken advocate for one of his solutions, a more energy-efficient rail system, and he writes, &quot;we have to get cracking on the revival of the railroad system if we expect to remain a united country.&quot;

==Reception==
A 2020 article at &quot;New Geography&quot; described one of Kunstler&#x27;s essays in &quot;American Conservative&quot; as a &quot;misanthropic, pessimistically aggressive Malthusian screed&quot;, and commented that Kunstler&#x27;s over-the-top act shows him to be &quot;survivalist masquerading as an urban geographer&quot;. The article points to Kunstler&#x27;s growing appeal to conservatives due to the &quot;overlap between libertarian conservatives and environmentalist zealots&quot;.

In 2005, conservative writer Bill Kauffman called Kunstler the &quot;scourge of suburbia,&quot; and a &quot;slashingly witty Jeremiah.&quot; In a 2008 review of Kunstler&#x27;s weekly audio podcast, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; described the KunstlerCast as offering &quot;some of the smartest, most honest urban commentary around—online or off.&quot; The Albany &quot;Times Union&quot; reviewed Kunstler&#x27;s book &quot;World Made by Hand&quot;, writing that &quot;James Howard Kunstler is fiddling his way to the apocalypse, one jig at a time.&quot; The paper described the book&#x27;s scenario as &quot;grim&quot;, with &quot;an upside or two.&quot;

Critiquing &quot;The Long Emergency&quot;, journalist Chris Hayes claimed in 2010 that while Kunstler makes valid points about the consequences of peak oil, he undermines his credibility with rhetoric and perceived misanthropy. Joseph Romm, a climate change expert and Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, stated that accelerating shifts toward renewable energy will maintain suburban lifestyles and that, contrary to Kunstler&#x27;s arguments, &quot;suburbia won&#x27;t be destroyed by peak oil.&quot;

Charles Bensinger, co-founder of Renewable Energy Partners of New Mexico, describes Kunstler&#x27;s views as &quot;fashionably fear-mongering&quot; and uninformed regarding the potential of renewable energy resources to eliminate the need for fossil fuels. In 2005, David Ehrenfeld, writing for &quot;American Scientist&quot;, saw Kunstler delivering a &quot;powerful integration of science, technology, economics, finance, international politics and social change&quot; with a &quot;lengthy discussion of the alternatives to cheap oil.&quot;

<text>A questionnaire is a research instrument that consists of a set of questions (or other types of prompts) for the purpose of gathering information from respondents through survey or statistical study. A research questionnaire is typically a mix of close-ended questions and open-ended questions. Open-ended, long-term questions offer the respondent the ability to elaborate on their thoughts. The Research questionnaire was developed by the Statistical Society of London in 1838.

Although questionnaires are often designed for statistical analysis of the responses, this is not always the case.

Questionnaires have advantages over some other types of survey tools in that they are cheap, do not require as much effort from the questioner as verbal or telephone surveys, and often have standardized answers that make it simple to compile data. However, such standardized answers may frustrate users as the possible answers may not accurately represent their desired responses. Questionnaires are also sharply limited by the fact that respondents must be able to read the questions and respond to them. Thus, for some demographic groups conducting a survey by questionnaire may not be concretely feasible.

==History==
One of the earliest questionnaires was Dean Milles&#x27; Questionnaire
of 1753.

== Types ==
A distinction can be made between questionnaires with questions that measure separate variables, and questionnaires with questions that are aggregated into either a scale or index.
Questionnaires with questions that measure separate variables, could, for instance, include questions on:
* preferences (e.g. political party)
* behaviors (e.g. food consumption)
* facts (e.g. gender)
Questionnaires with questions that are aggregated into either a scale or index include for instance questions that measure:
* latent traits 
* attitudes (e.g. towards immigration)
* an index (e.g. Social Economic Status)

=== Examples ===
* A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is a questionnaire the type of diet consumed in people, and may be used as a research instrument. Examples of usages include assessment of intake of vitamins or toxins such as acrylamide.

==Questionnaire construction==
===Question type===
Usually, a questionnaire consists of a number of questions (test items) that the respondent has to answer in a set format. A distinction is made between open-ended and closed-ended questions. An open-ended question asks the respondent to formulate his own answer, whereas a closed-ended question asks the respondent to pick an answer from a given number of options. The response options for a closed-ended question should be exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Four types of response scales for closed-ended questions are distinguished:
* Dichotomous, where the respondent has two options. The dichotomous question is generally a &quot;yes/no&quot; close-ended question. This question is usually used in case of the need for necessary validation. It is the most natural form of a questionnaire.
* Nominal-polytomous, where the respondent has more than two unordered options. The nominal scale, also called the categorical variable scale, is defined as a scale used for labeling variables into distinct classifications and does not involve a quantitative value or order.
* Ordinal-polytomous, where the respondent has more than two ordered options
* (Bounded)Continuous, where the respondent is presented with a continuous scale

A respondent&#x27;s answer to an open-ended question is coded into a response scale afterward. An example of an open-ended question is a question where the testee has to complete a sentence (sentence completion item).

===Question sequence===
In general, questions should flow logically from one to the next. To achieve the best response rates, questions should flow from the least sensitive to the most sensitive, from the factual and behavioural to the attitudinal, and from the more general to the more specific.

There typically is a flow that should be followed when constructing a questionnaire in regards to the order that the questions are asked. The order is as follows:
# Screens
# Warm-ups
# Transitions
# Skips
# Difficult
# Classification

Screens are used as a screening method to find out early whether or not someone should complete the questionnaire. 
Warm-ups are simple to answer, help capture interest in the survey, and may not even pertain to research objectives.
Transition questions are used to make different areas flow well together.
Skips include questions similar to &quot;If yes, then answer question 3. If no, then continue to question 5.&quot;
Difficult questions are towards the end because the respondent is in &quot;response mode.&quot; Also, when completing an online questionnaire, the progress bars lets the respondent know that they are almost done so they are more willing to answer more difficult questions.
Classification, or demographic question should be at the end because typically they can feel like personal questions which will make respondents uncomfortable and not willing to finish survey.

===Basic rules for questionnaire item construction===
* Use statements that are interpreted in the same way by members of different subpopulations of the population of interest.
* Use statements where persons that have different opinions or traits will give different answers.
* Think of having an &quot;open&quot; answer category after a list of possible answers.
* Use only one aspect of the construct you are interested in per item.
* Use positive statements and avoid negatives or double negatives.
* Do not make assumptions about the respondent.
* Use clear and comprehensible wording, easily understandable for all educational levels
* Use correct spelling, grammar and punctuation.
* Avoid items that contain more than one question per item (e.g. Do you like strawberries and potatoes?).
* Question should not be biased or even leading the participant towards an answer.
* Incorporate research questions like MaxDiff and Conjoint to help collect actionable data.

===Multi-item scales===

Within social science research and practice, questionnaires are most frequently used to collect quantitative data using multi-item scales with the following characteristics:
* Multiple statements or questions (minimum ≥3; usually ≥5) are presented for each variable being examined.
* Each statement or question has an accompanying set of equidistant response-points (usually 5–7).
* Each response point has an accompanying verbal anchor (e.g., &quot;strongly agree&quot;) ascending from left to right.
* Verbal anchors should be balanced to reflect equal intervals between response-points.
* Collectively, a set of response-points and accompanying verbal anchors are referred to as a rating scale. One very frequently-used rating scale is a Likert scale.
* Usually, for clarity and efficiency, a single set of anchors is presented for multiple rating scales in a questionnaire.
* Collectively, a statement or question with an accompanying rating scale is referred to as an item.
* When multiple items measure the same variable in a reliable and valid way, they are collectively referred to as a multi-item scale, or a psychometric scale.
* The following types of reliability and validity should be established for a multi-item scale: internal reliability, test-retest reliability (if the variable is expected to be stable over time), content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity. 
* Factor analysis is used in the scale development process.
* Questionnaires used to collect quantitative data usually comprise several multi-item scales, together with an introductory and concluding section.

==Questionnaire administration modes==
Main modes of questionnaire administration include:
* Face-to-face questionnaire administration, where an interviewer presents the items orally.
* Paper-and-pencil questionnaire administration, where the items are presented on paper.
* Computerized questionnaire administration, where the items are presented on the computer.
* Adaptive computerized questionnaire administration, where a selection of items is presented on the computer, and based on the answers on those items, the computer selects the following items optimized for the testee&#x27;s estimated ability or trait.

==Questionnaire translation==
Questionnaires are translated from a source language into one or more target languages, such as translating from English into Spanish and German. The process is not a mechanical word placement process. Best practice includes parallel translation, team discussions, and pretesting with real-life people, and is integrated in the model TRAPD (Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretest, and Documentation). A theoretical framework is also provided by sociolinguistics, which states that to achieve the equivalent communicative effect as the source language, the translation must be linguistically appropriate while incorporating the social practices and cultural norms of the target language.

Besides translators, a team approach is recommended in the questionnaire translation process to include subject-matter experts and persons helpful to the process. For example, even when project managers and researchers do not speak the language of the translation, they know the study objectives well and the intent behind the questions, and therefore have a key role in improving questionnaire translation.

==Concerns with questionnaires==
While questionnaires are inexpensive, quick, and easy to analyze, often the questionnaire can have more problems than benefits. For example, unlike interviews, the people conducting the research may never know if the respondent understood the question that was being asked. Also, because the questions are so specific to what the researchers are asking, the information gained can be minimal. Often, questionnaires such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, give too few options to answer; respondents can answer either option but must choose only one response. Questionnaires also produce very low return rates, whether they are mail or online questionnaires. The other problem associated with return rates is that often the people who do return the questionnaire are those who have a very positive or a very negative viewpoint and want their opinion heard. The people who are most likely unbiased either way typically do not respond because it is not worth their time.

One key concern with questionnaires is that they may contain quite large measurement errors. These errors can be random or systematic. Random errors are caused by unintended mistakes by respondents, interviewers, and/or coders. Systematic error can occur if there is a systematic reaction of the respondents to the scale used to formulate the survey question. Thus, the exact formulation of a survey question and its scale is crucial, since they affect the level of measurement error.

Further, if the questionnaires are not collected using sound sampling techniques, often the results can be non-representative of the population—as such a good sample is critical to getting representative results based on questionnaires.

<text>The Gotha Go 242 was a transport glider used by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II. It was an upgrade over the DFS 230 in both cargo/troop capacity and flight characteristics. It saw limited combat action. There were multiple glider variants, and it became the basis for a transport aircraft, the: Gotha Go 244.

==Development==

The Go 242 was designed by Dipl-Ing Albert Kalkert in response to a &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) requirement for a heavy transport glider to replace the DFS 230 then in service. The requirement was for a glider capable of carrying 20 fully laden troops or the equivalent cargo.

The aircraft was a high-wing monoplane with a simple square-section fuselage ending in clamshell doors used to load cargo. The empennage was mounted on twin booms linked by a tailplane. The fuselage was formed of steel tubing covered with doped fabric. The flight characteristics of the design were better than those of the DFS 230.

Cargo versions of the glider featured a hinged rear fuselage loading ramp that could accommodate a small vehicle such as a &quot;Kübelwagen&quot; or loads of similar size and weight.

Two prototypes flew in 1941 and the type quickly entered production. A total of 1,528 were built, 133 B-1 to B-5s were converted to the Go 244, with two Gnome-Rhône 14M engines, (a paired -04 and -05 rotating in opposite directions), fitted to forward extensions of the tail booms.

The Go 242 was tested with various rockets for overloaded take offs. A rack of four Rheinmetall-Borsig 109-502 rockets mounted on the rear of the cargo compartment was tested but not used operationally. A second rocket, called &quot;R-&quot;Gerät&quot;&quot;, also used with the glider, was a liquid-fuelled Walter HWK 109-500A (R I-203) &quot;Starthilfe&quot;; a podded monopropellant (T-Stoff, stabilised high test peroxide), rocket engine mounted beneath each wing and jettisoned after take-off, parachuting down to be recycled.

==Operational history==

In service, Go 242s were towed into the air by Heinkel He 111s or Junkers Ju 52s, and were occasionally fitted with RATO equipment. Most saw service in the Mediterranean, North Africa and Aegean. Ju 87D-2s had strengthened rear fuselage and combined tailwheel and hook for towing the Go 242.

A few gliders, the Go 242 C-1 variant, were constructed with a flying boat-style hull allowing water landings. It was proposed that some carry a small catamaran assault boat with a explosive charge suspended between its hulls. The proposed mission profile was for the pilot to land near an enemy ship and transfer to the assault boat, setting off at high speed for the enemy ship and locking the controls before bailing out.

<text>The spark-ignition petrol engines listed below operate on the four-stroke cycle, and unless stated otherwise, use a wet sump lubrication system, and are water-cooled.

Since the Volkswagen Group is German, official internal combustion engine performance ratings are published using the International System of Units (commonly abbreviated &quot;SI&quot;), a modern form of the metric system of figures. Motor vehicle engines will have been tested by a Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) accredited testing facility, to either the original &quot;80/1269/EEC&quot;, or the later &quot;1999/99/EC&quot; standards. The standard initial measuring unit for establishing the rated motive power output is the kilowatt (kW); and in their official literature, the power rating may be published in either the kW, or the metric horsepower (often abbreviated &quot;PS&quot; for the German word &quot;Pferdestärke&quot;), or both, and may also include conversions to imperial units such as the horsepower (hp) or brake horsepower (bhp). (Conversions: one PS = 735.5 watts (W); ˜ 0.98632 hp (SAE)). In case of conflict, the metric power figure of kilowatts (kW) will be stated as the primary figure of reference. For the turning force generated by the engine, the Newton metre (Nm) will be the reference figure of torque. Furthermore, in accordance with European automotive traditions, engines shall be listed in the following &quot;ascending&quot; order of preference:
#Number of cylinders,
#Engine displacement (in litres),
#Engine configuration, and
#Rated motive power output (in kilowatts).

The petrol engines which Volkswagen Group previously manufactured and installed are in the list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines article.
==Nomenclature==
Both vehicle and engine platforms developed by Volkswagen are specified internally as an &quot;Entwicklungsauftrag&quot; (&quot;EA&quot;), or &quot;development assignment&quot;. The numbers denoting a particular &quot;Entwicklungsauftrag&quot; don&#x27;t follow a strictly chronological scheme but have generally increased over time.

==EA211 R3/R4==

The EA211 engines are a completely new four-cylinder turbocharged and direct-injection TSI engines. Compared to its predecessor, the EA211 series is significantly more compact, with installation length shorter, thus offering more interior space. The installation position of the engines has also been optimised. Just as in the diesels, the petrol engines are now mounted with the exhaust side facing backwards and tilted at an angle of 12 degrees. The weight of these petrol engines made of die-cast aluminium is only for the 1.2 TSI and for the 1.4 TSI. The crankshaft alone became lighter by 20 per cent; the connecting rods lost 30 per cent of their weight. In addition the connecting rod bearing journals are now hollow-drilled and pistons now come with flat bottoms, all of them optimized for lower weight.
Regarding thermal management, the EA211 petrol engine is equipped with a modern dual-circuit cooling system. That means that a high temperature circuit with a mechanically driven cooling pump cools the basic engine, while a low temperature circuit flows through the intercooler and the turbo-charger casing. The cylinder-head circuit heats the cabin&#x27;s interior. The exhaust manifold is integrated into the cylinder head, enabling the engine to warm up more quickly, in turn making heat available quickly for the passenger cabin. At high loads, the exhaust is cooled by the coolant, lowering fuel consumption.

New lightweight aluminum construction, an integrated (into the head) exhaust manifold, and a toothed-belt drive for its double overhead
camshaft valvetrain that incorporates variable intake and exhaust timing. The only aspect to be carried over from the EA111 engine that
preceded it is the 82 mm cylinder spacing. The cylinder bore was decreased by 2 mm (to 74.5mm) while the stroke was increased to 80mm, a
change which helps compactness, increases torque, and is ideal for adding boost.

==EA113 R4==

The EA827 family of internal combustion engines was initially developed by Audi under Ludwig Kraus leadership and introduced in 1972 in the Audi 80, and was eventually superseded by the EA113 evolution introduced in 1993. Both share the same cylinder spacing. The latter EA113 was updated with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection, to be topped by the 2.0 TFSI used in the Audi TTS. Forty million engines have been produced. This range will eventually be superseded by the evolved version with heavy changes EA888 project, introduced with the 1.8 TSI/TFSI below, but the EA113 still remains in production.

===1.4 R4 16v TSI/TFSI===
Based on the EA111, this new engine was announced at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show, to be first used in the Mk5 Golf GT, the 125 kW 1.4-litre TSI engine is a &quot;Twincharger&quot;, and uses both a turbocharger and a supercharger. Its displacement downsizing leads to improved fuel economy, with 14% more power than the 2.0 FSI, but consuming 5% less fuel. The mechanical supercharger compressor, driven at 5 times the speed of the crankshaft, mainly operates at low engine speeds from idle up to 2,400 revolutions per minute (rpm) to increase low-end torque. At engine speeds just above idle, the belt-driven supercharger provides a boost pressure of . The turbocharger assumes full effectiveness at middle revs, and the engine map disengages the clutch-controlled supercharger at a maximum upper limit of 3,500 rpm; the supercharger will then be bypassed once the turbocharger spools up and reaches sufficient speed to provide adequate boost in the upper rev-ranges. This engine is made at Volkswagen-Motorenfertigung, Chemnitz.

In 2007, Volkswagen announced the 90 kW model which will replace the 1.6 FSI engine. This engine differs from the 103 kW and 125 kW models in several ways. It uses only one method of forced induction – a turbocharger (and not a supercharger), and has water-cooled intercooler. The engine has reduced frictional losses, optimised camshafts, new intake ports, and new high-pressure injector valves. It is also lighter than the 125 kW model, in order to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions.

===1.8 R4 20vT (EA113/EA827)===
Wholly created and developed by AUDI AG, this version is a 1.8-litre 20-valve turbocharged engine built in Wolfsburg, Germany; Győr, Hungary; and Puebla, Mexico. Output varies based on internal component selection, turbocharger, and engine control unit (ECU) software. This ubiquitous power plant has been extensively used in all four mainstream Volkswagen Group marques, along with Volkswagen Industrial Motor applications.

This engine is also used in a very high state of tune in the one-make Formula Palmer Audi (FPA) open-wheeled auto racing series. It develops , with an extra available from a driver operated &#x27;push-to-pass&#x27; turbo boost button. Based entirely on road-car production engines and prepared and built by Mountune Racing, it only differs by utilising a Pi Research Pectel electronic fuel injection and a water-cooled Garrett T34 turbocharger with closed-loop boost control.

Furthermore, an even higher &#x27;step up&#x27; version of this engine was used in the later European-based FIA Formula Two Championship. Developed as a pure race engine and again built by Mountune Racing, this variant includes many all-new lightweight components, and has been converted to a dry sump lubrication system. For its initial 2009 season, it produced a continuous maximum power of at 8,250 revolutions per minute (rpm), and includes a limited duration &#x27;overboost&#x27; to , aided by an all-new Garrett GT35 turbocharger and a Pi Research Pectel MQ12 ECU. From the 2010 season, base power is increased to , and with overboost to .

== EA888 R3/R4==
The EA888 engines are a family of three- and four-cylinder engines that are currently in use across the Volkswagen Group. An EA888 family is a corporate VAG designed unit that is an evolution of the earlier EA827/113 units. It features some of the latest engine technology such as direct fuel injection, sintered camshaft lobes, thin-walled engine block, variable valve timing and lift for intake and exhaust valves, downstream oxygen sensors, exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, exhaust gas recirculation and cooling, distributors coil-on-plug ignition, lightweight engine internals, slide valve thermostat (some variants), and the addition of port fuel injection to aid low load fuel consumption and cold start emissions. The port fuel injection also aids in reducing the potential carbon deposits that can occur in direct-injected engines. As of 2024, the &#x27;dual injection&#x27; system has not been offered in North American markets. Still, VAG has made numerous enhancements to their engine designs such as the positive crankcase ventilation, repositioning injectors and more to lessen the potential that carbon deposits accumulate on intake valves. Currently, the EA888 engine is available in two sizes: 1.8T and 2.0T. Engine output ranges from to over . A concept car based on the Volkswagen Golf R, dubbed R400, produced 395 hp from 2 litres of displacement. Furthermore, the R400 would be able to accelerate from 0–100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds, thanks to a haldex 4-wheel drive system, and a 6 or 7-speed DSG gearbox. The EA888 engine family has also found its way into the Porsche lineup, specifically in the Macan models. The Macan uses a reworked version of the Volkswagen Group’s 2.0-litre inline-four EA888 Gen 3 engine. This engine is a variant of the EA888, producing 261 hp and 295 lb-ft. It’s paired with a Doppelkupplungsgetriebe, which means PDK (dual-clutch transmission) and is Porsche&#x27;s version of the DSG found in VAG vehicles. The PDK transmission is essentially two gearboxes in one and features hydraulically actuated wet-clutch packs. Depending on the gear, it alternates power to the engine via two separate driveshafts. This combination of the EA888 engine and PDK transmission in the Porsche Macan showcases the versatility of these technologies and their ability to enhance performance across different vehicle models within the Volkswagen Group.

This latest EA888 family of straight-four 16-valve internal combustion engines with variable valve timing is anticipated to be an eventual complete replacement of the EA113 range. It was wholly designed and developed by VAG AG. The only common feature with its predecessors is the sharing of the same cylinder spacing – which keeps the engine length relatively short, meaning it can be installed either transversely or longitudinally, though engineers have said that it is an evolution of the earlier EA827/113 designs due to cost concerns. Grey cast iron (GJL 250) remains the choice material for the cylinder block and crankcase, due to its inherent good acoustic dampening properties. This all-new EA888 range is notable for utilising simplex roller chains to drive the two overhead camshafts, instead of the former engines&#x27; toothed-rubber timing belt. Like the final developments of the former EA113 engine generation, all EA888s only use the VAG AG/Bosch Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection. Furthermore, EA888 engines are also able to utilise the corporate &#x27;valvelift&#x27; technology, which complements the existing variable valve timing. This new family of engines is scheduled to be universally available for all markets on five continents, within all marques of the Volkswagen Group. The closely related EA113 range still remains in production.

Grainger &amp; Worrall was reported to have cast 50 CGI cylinder blocks for over 12 months as of October 2013, based on the EA888 gasoline engine.

There are five generation of EA888. Gen 1 and Gen 2 from 2007-2011, Gen 3 from 2011-2020, Gen 4 from 2020. Volkswagen announcement EA888 Gen 5 on Teramont Pro in 2025.

:Winner of the &quot;1.8-litre 2.0-litre&quot; category in the 2009 annual competition for International Engine of the Year.

==== Known problems ====
The Generation 1 EA888 suffered from higher than usual / favorable engine oil consumption in both 1.8 and 2.0 litre forms. Mainly affecting the Longitudinal Audi applications between 2008 and 2012 (most commonly the 8K / B8 A4 8T / 8F B8 A5 &amp; 8R Q5). In rare occurrences it affects the Transverse applications in the 8P Audi A3, 8J Audi TT and in even rarer occasions would affect the MK6 Volkswagen Golf GTI and lower powered Sciroccos etc. that were not fitted with the EA113 family of engines. In even more extreme cases it would affect the Generation 3 from 2016 to present day. The rectification for this is performed after a two part oil consumption test is carried out by a main dealer, The vehicle will need to be burning more than approximately a metric litre per 1,000 KM or 600 miles, or if the top up oil warning illuminates on the instrument cluster. Only after this test is carried out and an agreement of payment by the manufacturer &amp; customer contribution is agreed the repair can be carried out only by main dealers and manufacturer approved repairers. The rectification that is carried out is to remove the engine, replace the Piston &amp; Connecting Rod assemblies in all four cylinders with modified units, head gasket and so forth. From late 2012, the modified internal engine components were fitted to new replacement engines and new vehicle units by the Volkswagen group engine plants.

Another common issue is camshaft timing chain tensioner failure, again in earlier generation 1 models. This was due to the design of the retaining element that after higher mileages and / or premature wear stopped the tensioner from holding the tension in the timing chain. If in the case of this component 
failing, the chain would jump, allowing the pistons and valves to potentially hit each other, causing expensive and possibly terminal engine damage. Along with the earlier mentioned oil consumption issues, this was eventually addressed by the Volkswagen Group engine plants, Who fitted a modified (internally known as Version 2) tensioner that is retained by a much more reliable spring retainer instead.

The final mainstream common issue affects all EA888 generations. The cooling system is mainly a problem free system, with the exception of the plastic thermostat unit, these are very commonly known to be prone to leaks, with no specific part of the housing known to leak. On the EA888, the thermostat unit also includes the coolant pump, on the Generation 2 &amp; 3 the coolant pump is still part of the thermostat, however is available separately. The coolant pump / thermostat unit is located under the intake manifold regardless of generation, model year or application. The thermostat side is joined by a plastic union directly to the engine oil cooler, which in turn is mounted to and is an integral part of the ancillary / alternator bracket (also includes the oil filter housing in all generations and applications). The coolant pump is driven by the intake side balance shaft, on the flywheel side of the engine. The rectification is to renew the thermostat unit with a modified unit, and if needed in later models, the coolant pump if necessary. However these newer units are still known to leak. There have currently been no further modifications to the design of this to combat the issues by Volkswagen Group.

===== Turbo =====
Source:

The MQB platform suffers from early turbocharger failure. This affects models like the Audi S3, Golf 7 R/GTI and the Seat Cupra models. More so: models built prior to 2015 are more prone to failure. This can be caused because there is shaft play due to an imbalanced input shaft which can cause the turbine to collide with the teflon coating of the turbocharger, or because of the manifold sealing surface.

==EA390 VR6==
The VR6 concept as a whole replaces opposing cylinders in a V-arrangement with staggered ones, creating something between an I6 and a V6. By staggering the cylinders, a much tighter V-angle can be achieved, resulting in a tighter form factor and more efficient packaging.

The EA390 was originally a 3.2L cast aluminium block that was released in 2001 in the European markets, and was used across various Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche vehicles. The engine was derived from earlier smaller 2.8L variants found mainly in various 1990s Volkswagens, such as the Golf and the Corrado. It was later discountined in European markets due to favour of more efficient layouts, despite being one of the more efficient naturally aspirated V-style designs of the time. 

Currently, a 2.5 VR6 engine is only available for Chinese market on Volkswagen Teramont and Talagon. It is derived from now retired 3.0 VR6 engine, which also was available in China only.

==EA825 V8==

EA824 and EA825 are families of twin turbo 90 degrees V8 spark ignition engines.
Audi uses the EA824, while Porsche uses EA825 for Panamera Turbo. Bentley uses this for the Bentayga V8.
EA825 uses two twin-scroll turbochargers, iron coating on the cylinder linings, fuel injector at centre of combustion chamber, cylinder deactivation at 950–3500rpm with a torque limit.

Of their eight-cylinder petrol engines, all Volkswagen Group V8 engines are primarily constructed from a lightweight cast aluminium alloy cylinder block (crankcase) and cylinder heads. They all use multi-valve technology, with the valves being operated by two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank (sometimes referred to as &#x27;quad cam&#x27;). All functions of engine control are carried out by varying types of Robert Bosch GmbH Motronic electronic engine control units.

These V8 petrol engines initially were only used in cars bearing the Audi marque, but are now also installed in Volkswagen Passenger Cars &#x27;premium models&#x27;. They are all longitudinally orientated, and with the exception of the Audi R8, are front-mounted.

This engine is part of Audi&#x27;s modular 90° V6/V8 engine family. It shares its bore and stroke, 90° V-angle, and 90mm cylinder spacing with the Audi V6. The earlier V6 engines (EA837) used an Eaton TVS Supercharger instead of turbocharger(s). In 2016, Audi and Porsche released a new turbocharged V6 engine they dubbed EA839. These 2.9L (biturbo) &amp; 3.0L (single turbo) V6 engines share the 4.0T TFSI V8&#x27;s &quot;hot vee&quot; design, meaning the turbo(s) are placed in the Vee of the engine (between each bank of cylinders) instead of on the outside of each cylinder bank. This allows the turbocharger(s) to produce boost pressure more quickly as the path the exhaust gases travel is much reduced. It also aids in getting the engine&#x27;s emissions hardware up to temperature more quickly. As with the V6, the V8 is used in various Audi and Porsche models, but the V8 also finds use in Bentley and Lamborghini vehicles.

<text>Rabies virus, scientific name Rabies lyssavirus, is a neurotropic virus that causes rabies in animals, including humans. It can cause violence, hydrophobia, and fever. Rabies transmission can also occur through the saliva of animals and less commonly through contact with human saliva. &quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot;, like many rhabdoviruses, has an extremely wide host range. In the wild it has been found infecting many mammalian species, while in the laboratory it has been found that birds can be infected, as well as cell cultures from mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. Rabies is reported in more than 150 countries and on all continents except Antarctica. The main burden of disease is reported in Asia and Africa, but some cases have been reported also in Europe in the past 10 years, especially in returning travellers.

&quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; has a cylindrical morphology and is a member of the &quot;Lyssavirus&quot; genus of the &quot;Rhabdoviridae&quot; family. These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded RNA genome with negative-sense. The genetic information is packaged as a ribonucleoprotein complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein. The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved. These genes code for nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the viral RNA polymerase (L). The complete genome sequences range from 11,615 to 11,966 nt in length.

All transcription and replication events take place in the cytoplasm inside a specialized &quot;virus factory&quot;, the &quot;Negri body&quot; (named after Adelchi Negri). These are 2–10 μm in diameter and are typical for a rabies infection and thus have been used as definite histological proof of such infection.

==Structure==

Rhabdoviruses have helical symmetry, so their infectious particles are approximately cylindrical in shape. They are characterized by an extremely broad host spectrum ranging from plants to insects and mammals; human-infecting viruses more commonly have icosahedral symmetry and take shapes approximating regular polyhedra.

The rabies genome encodes five proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L). All rhabdoviruses have two major structural components: a helical ribonucleoprotein core (RNP) and a surrounding envelope. In the RNP, genomic RNA is tightly encased by the nucleoprotein. Two other viral proteins, the phosphoprotein and the large protein (L-protein or polymerase) are associated with the RNP. The glycoprotein forms approximately 400 trimeric spikes which are tightly arranged on the surface of the virus. The M protein is associated both with the envelope and the RNP and may be the central protein of rhabdovirus assembly.

&quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; has a bullet-like shape with a length of about 180 nm and a cross-sectional diameter of about 75 nm. One end is rounded or conical and the other end is planar or concave. The lipoprotein envelope carries knob-like spikes composed of Glycoprotein G. Spikes do not cover the planar end of the virion (virus particle). Beneath the envelope is the membrane or matrix (M) protein layer which may be invaginated at the planar end. The core of the virion consists of helically arranged ribonucleoprotein.

==Genome organization==
The rhabdovirus virion is an enveloped, rod- or bullet-shaped structure containing five protein species:
* The nucleoprotein (N) coats the RNA at the rate of one monomer of protein to nine nucleotides, forming a nucleocapsid with helical symmetry. Associated with the nucleocapsid are copies of P (phosphoprotein) and L (large) protein.
* The L protein is well named, its gene taking up about half of the genome. Its large size is justified by the fact that it is a multifunctional protein.
* The M (matrix) protein forms a layer between the nucleocapsid and the envelope
* Trimers of G (glycoprotein) form spikes that protrude from the envelope.
The genomes of most rhabdoviruses possess the five genes encoding these proteins, as in the case of &quot;Rhabdovirus lyssae&quot;.

=== Proteins ===
Rabies virus is estimated to cause around 55,000 deaths per year across the world and has a death rate of nearly 100%. These statistics coupled with the fact that there is currently no specific treatment, or antiviral drug makes research on the virus of vital importance for the scientific community in order to possibly lower the current death rate. The rabies virus phosphoprotein and polymerase are both important targets for antivirals and are currently used to create the vaccine used for domestic and wild animals. A lot of research is being done to better understand the specific roles and functions of the L-P protein because there is significant evidence already that it could be one of the most important proteins to target for future drugs.

There are five proteins that are coded for by the rabies virus genome—phosphoprotein (P), polymerase (L), matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), and glycoprotein (G). These five proteins are transcribed into mRNA in different quantities. The protein transcribed the most is the nucleoprotein, then the phosphoprotein, then the matrix protein, then the glycoprotein and finally the polymerase. Of those proteins, the ones that may be the most important for the functions of the virus are the L-P protein complex. These two proteins are required for the production of all of the proteins utilized by the rabies virus and they interact with many of the other proteins to complete the functions needed by the virus to infect cells, replicate and complete other vital functions. When the structure of the L-P protein was analyzed using UCSF Chimera, it was found that it contained two zinc molecules as well as 2 five-membered rings. The secondary structures were also analyzed, and it was found that there were three different kinds-coil, helix and strand.

==== Phosphoprotein ====
The phosphoprotein (P) consists of 297 amino acids, has a total mass of 33 k-Da and is a type I interferon antagonist. It is in a viral ribonucleoprotein made up of RNA surrounded by nucleoproteins (N), which form a structure that is ring-like. Each nucleoprotein surrounds nine nucleotides of the RNA and the nucleoproteins in conjunction with the phosphoprotein are important for initiating synthesis of the RNA. The phosphoprotein is largely responsible for preventing the immune system from destroying the virus before it can take hold. It has been found that it stops production of interferons by disrupting the interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and, therefore, prevents the normal function of the interferons, which allows it to continue to infect the host. The phosphoprotein is also very important for replication. It is a required cofactor of the viral polymerase (L) and is also a chaperone for the nucleoprotein (N), which is responsible for the encapsidation of viral RNA. It is thought that the P protein consists of only a few repeating units.

==== Large structural protein (polymerase) ====
The polymerase (L) consists of 2,127 amino acids, has a total mass of 242 k-Da and interacts with the phosphoprotein to form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. L and P bind to each other and according to current research, the major L binding site is somewhere in the first 19 residues of the P protein. Other research found that the amino acid sequence numbered 1929 to 1933 is the sequence that is important for the L protein to bind with the P protein. It has been found that the L protein initiates synthesis and works optimally if it works together with the P protein. The region from 1900 to 1930, which contains part of the sequence that is important for L and P protein binding, and the region from 1870 to 1890 are hydrophilic regions and are also highly conserved among rabies virus strains. The 1929 to 1933 sequence is also of importance because it is involved with RNA synthesis of the virus and thus could possibly be a target for new drugs. The carboxy-terminal domain of L must be present in order for L to bind to P. The L protein also has a catalytic center while the P protein is believed to not have a catalytic center. There is evidence that for the rabies virus, the L protein can be expressed even if the P protein is not expressed. This is different from many other related viruses, which require both to be expressed and present. One of the domains in the L protein is responsible for speeding up the reaction that results in the capping of the RNA and thus could possibly be another good target for an antiviral drug. The nucleoproteins (N), which it was previously mentioned aid the P protein, also interact with the L protein and this is necessary for initiation. The interactions between the L protein and the M protein have also been noted to be of importance to its function. Research has shown that there are interactions between the two proteins in relation to the balance of transcription and translation. The polymerase is an enzyme and can aid in initiation, elongation, capping, methylation, polyadenylation and RNA polymerization.

==Life cycle==
After receptor binding, &quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; enters its host cells through the endosomal transport pathway. Inside the endosome, the low pH value induces the membrane fusion process, thus enabling the viral genome to reach the cytosol. Both processes, receptor binding and membrane fusion, are catalyzed by the glycoprotein G which plays a critical role in pathogenesis (mutant virus without G proteins cannot propagate).

The next step after its entry is the transcription of the viral genome by the P-L polymerase (P is an essential cofactor for the L polymerase) in order to make new viral protein. The viral polymerase can only recognize ribonucleoprotein and cannot use free RNA as template. Transcription is regulated by &quot;cis&quot;-acting sequences on the virus genome and by protein M which is not only essential for virus budding but also regulates the fraction of mRNA production to replication. Later in infection, the activity of the polymerase switches to replication in order to produce full-length positive-strand RNA copies. These complementary RNAs are used as templates to make new negative-strand RNA genomes. They are packaged together with protein N to form ribonucleoprotein which then can form new viruses.

==Infection==

In September 1931, Joseph Lennox Pawan of Trinidad found Negri bodies in the brain of a bat with unusual habits. In 1932, Pawan first discovered that infected vampire bats could transmit rabies to humans and other animals.

Rabies virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal, allowing it to penetrate the skin, infect tissues, and neurons through their nerve endings and spreading to the nervous system. The retrograde axonal transport of &quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; to the central nervous system (CNS) is the key step of pathogenesis during natural infection. The exact molecular mechanism of this transport is unknown although binding of the P protein from &quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; to the dynein light chain protein DYNLL1 has been shown. P also acts as an interferon antagonist, thus decreasing the immune response of the host.

From the CNS, the virus further spreads to other organs. The salivary glands located in the tissues of the mouth and cheeks receive high concentrations of the virus, thus allowing it to be further transmitted due to projectile salivation. Fatality can occur from two days to five years from the time of initial infection. This however depends largely on the species of animal acting as a reservoir. Most infected mammals die within weeks, while strains of a species such as the African yellow mongoose (&quot;Cynictis penicillata&quot;) might survive an infection asymptomatically for years.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days. There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. At the onset of these progressive symptoms, the disease begins to worsen. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia. &quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; may also be inactive in its host&#x27;s body and become active after a long period of time.

The incubation period for this virus, in some cases, can last anywhere from weeks to months. This does not depend on specific form of the virus. This long incubation period is most likely due to the presence of microRNA, which slow down viral replication in the muscles. However, when the patient starts to exhibit prodromal symptoms (fever, flu) and gastrointestinal symptoms, the virus has widely spread. Prodromal symptoms are noted within the first 2–10 days after incubation and include fever and fatigue. They can also involve the respiratory system, causing sore throat and cough, the gastrointestinal system, causing anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and central nervous system. The central nervous system is the most prevalent in some cases and includes symptoms like headache, vertigo, anxiety, nightmares, depression, and more. The neurological dysfunction starts when the central nervous system begins to slow and not function properly.

== Classification and antigenic types ==
The &quot;Lyssavirus&quot; genome includes a variety of viruses ranging from the rabies virus to genetically and anti-genetically rabies-like related viruses. These viruses include Lagos Bat, Mokola, and Duvenhage viruses, as well as European bat viruses. Through other anti-genetic characterization, over 350 rabies viruses of just the Americas were discovered. Four phylogenetic groups were associated with these viruses. Additionally, other areas of ciruculation for the virus, such as &quot;E. fuscus&quot;, were found through this discovery. Although these viruses are from the same genome, cross-protection studies show that animals that had taken the &quot;Lyssavirus&quot; vaccine for traditional rabies were not fully protected when exposed to other types of &quot;Lyssavirus&quot;.

This leads to different categorization of these Rabies viruses. A fixed classification denotes that the virus was adapted by passage in animals or cell culture. Wild type classification, more generally known as street type, implies the virus was adapted through other means, such as a bite. To differentiate street rabies variants, monoclonal antibodies identified origins in host reservoirs throughout the world. This suggested sources of exposure even when the bite was missing from patient history.

==Antigenicity==
Upon viral entry into the body and also after vaccination, the body produces virus neutralizing antibodies which bind and inactivate the virus. Specific regions of the G protein have been shown to be most antigenic in leading to the production of virus neutralizing antibodies. These antigenic sites, or epitopes, are categorized into regions I–IV and minor site a. Previous work has demonstrated that antigenic sites II and III are most commonly targeted by natural neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, a monoclonal antibody with neutralizing functionality has been demonstrated to target antigenic site I. Other proteins, such as the nucleoprotein, have been shown to be unable to elicit production of virus neutralizing antibodies. The epitopes which bind neutralizing antibodies are both linear and conformational.

==Evolution==
All extant rabies viruses appear to have evolved within the last 1500 years. There are seven genotypes of &quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot;. In Eurasia, cases are due to three of these: genotype 1 (classical rabies) and to a lesser extent genotypes 5 and 6 (European bat lyssaviruses type-1 and -2). Genotype 1 evolved in Europe in the 17th century and spread to Asia, Africa, and the Americas as a result of European exploration and colonization.

Bat rabies in North America appears to have been present since 1281 AD (95% confidence interval: 906–1577 AD).

The rabies virus appears to have undergone an evolutionary shift in hosts from Chiroptera (bats) to a species of Carnivora (i.e. raccoon or skunk) as a result of an homologous recombination event that occurred hundreds of years ago. This recombination event altered the gene that encodes the virus glycoprotein that is necessary for receptor recognition and binding.

==Application==
&quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; is used in research for viral neuronal tracing to establish synaptic connections and directionality of synaptic transmission.

Recent research is focused on stabilizing the trimeric pre-fusion form of the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G), which is the most immunogenic conformation of the protein. Mutations like H270P and H261L enhance the stability of this form, making it a more effective immunogen. This approach aims to develop vaccines that are both more cost-effective and have better protective coverage, addressing the ongoing global need for rabies prevention.

Interestingly, the rabies virus vaccine that was created using the SAD-B19 complex, which includes the L-P protein, was utilized in the creation of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein from SARS-CoV-2 was inserted into the rabies virus vaccine vector to create a new vaccine that was shown to be effective in protecting against COVID-19. Rabies virus has also been used to create a vaccine against Ebola, called FiloRab1, and it was found to be 100% effective for nonhuman primates.

<doc id="956498" wikidata="Q962295" url="?curid=956498" title="Earl Stanhope">
<text>Earl Stanhope () was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. The earldom was created in 1718 for Major General James Stanhope, a principal minister of King George I, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. He was the son of the Hon. Alexander Stanhope, fifth and youngest son of Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield. In 1717, James Stanhope had been raised to the peerage as Viscount Stanhope, of Mahón in the Island of Minorca, and Baron Stanhope, of Elvaston in the County of Derby, with special remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to his second cousin John Stanhope of Elvaston (who was the father of William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington) and the heirs male of his body. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. The heir apparent of the Earls Stanhope used Viscount Mahon as a courtesy title.

==Subsequent history==

The first Earl&#x27;s grandson, the third Earl, was a politician and scientist, known as &quot;Citizen Stanhope&quot; because of his sympathy for the French Revolution. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He represented several constituencies in the House of Commons but is chiefly remembered for his involvement in the Kaspar Hauser case. His son, the fifth Earl, was a Tory politician and historian. He served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and also published a biography on William Pitt the Younger. Upon his death, the titles passed to his son, the sixth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served briefly as a Lord of the Treasury from 1874 to 1875 in Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s second administration. In addition, the sixth Earl was Lord Lieutenant of Kent.

His son, the seventh Earl, was also a Conservative politician and notably served as President of the Board of Education, as Leader of the House of Lords and as First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1952, the seventh Earl succeeded his distant relative Edward Scudamore-Stanhope, 12th Earl of Chesterfield, as thirteenth Earl of Chesterfield and 13th Baron Stanhope. However, he never applied for a writ of summons to the House of Lords in these titles and continued to be known as the Earl Stanhope. On his death in 1967, the earldoms of Stanhope and Chesterfield and the barony of Stanhope became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the viscountcy of Stanhope of Mahon and the barony of Stanhope of Elvaston according to the special remainder by his distant kinsman, William Stanhope, 11th Earl of Harrington.

Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale, was a younger son of the fifth Earl.

<doc id="956499" wikidata="Q451816" url="?curid=956499" title="Application firewall">
<text>An application firewall is a form of firewall that controls input/output or system calls of an application or service. It operates by monitoring and blocking communications based on a configured policy, generally with predefined rule sets to choose from. The two primary categories of application firewalls are &quot;network-based&quot; and &quot;host-based&quot;.

== History ==
Gene Spafford of Purdue University, Bill Cheswick at AT&amp;T Laboratories, and Marcus Ranum described a third-generation firewall known as an application layer firewall. Marcus Ranum&#x27;s work, based on the firewall created by Paul Vixie, Brian Reid, and Jeff Mogul, spearheaded the creation of the first commercial product. The product was released by DEC, named the DEC SEAL by Geoff Mulligan - Secure External Access Link. DEC&#x27;s first major sale was on June 13, 1991, to Dupont.

Under a broader DARPA contract at TIS, Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, and Peter Churchyard developed the Firewall Toolkit (FWTK) and made it freely available under license in October 1993. The purposes for releasing the freely available, not for commercial use, FWTK were: to demonstrate, via the software, documentation, and methods used, how a company with (at the time) 11 years experience in formal security methods, and individuals with firewall experience, developed firewall software; to create a common base of very good firewall software for others to build on (so people did not have to continue to &quot;roll their own&quot; from scratch); to &quot;raise the bar&quot; of firewall software being used. However, FWTK was a basic application proxy requiring the user interactions.

In 1994, Wei Xu extended the FWTK with the Kernel enhancement of IP stateful filter and socket transparent. This was the first transparent firewall, known as the inception of the third generation firewall, beyond a traditional application proxy (the second generation firewall), released as the commercial product known as Gauntlet firewall. Gauntlet firewall was rated one of the top application firewalls from 1995 until 1998, the year it was acquired by Network Associates Inc, (NAI). Network Associates continued to claim that Gauntlet was the &quot;worlds most secure firewall&quot; but in May 2000, security researcher Jim Stickley discovered a large vulnerability in the firewall, allowing remote access to the operating system and bypassing the security controls. Stickley discovered a second vulnerability a year later, effectively ending Gauntlet firewalls&#x27; security dominance.

== Description ==
Application layer filtering operates at a higher level than traditional security appliances. This allows packet decisions to be made based on more than just source/destination IP Address or ports and can also use information spanning across multiple connections for any given host.

=== Network-based application firewalls ===
Network-based application firewalls operate at the application layer of a TCP/IP stack and can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows it to identify unwanted applications or services using a non standard port or detect if an allowed protocol is being abused.

Modern versions of network-based application firewalls can include the following technologies:
*Encryption offloading
*Intrusion prevention system
*Data loss prevention

Web application firewalls (WAF) are a specialized version of a network-based appliance that acts as a reverse proxy, inspecting traffic before being forwarded to an associated server.

=== Host-based application firewalls ===
A host-based application firewall monitors application system calls or other general system communication. This gives more granularity and control, but is limited to only protecting the host it is running on. Control is applied by filtering on a per process basis. Generally, prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection. Further filtering can be done by examining the process ID of the owner of the data packets. Many host-based application firewalls are combined or used in conjunction with a packet filter.

Due to technological limitations, modern solutions such as sandboxing are being used as a replacement of host-based application firewalls to protect system processes.

== Implementations ==
There are various application firewalls available, including both free and open source software and commercial products.

=== Mac OS X ===
Starting with Mac OS X Leopard, an implementation of the TrustedBSD MAC framework (taken from FreeBSD), was included. The TrustedBSD MAC framework is used to sandbox services and provides a firewall layer, given the configuration of the sharing services in Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard. Third-party applications can provide extended functionality, including filtering out outgoing connections by app.

=== Linux ===
This is a list of security software packages for Linux, allowing filtering of application to OS communication, possibly on a by-user basis:
* AppArmor
* Kerio Control — a commercial product from Kerio Technologies
* ModSecurity — also works under Windows, Mac OS X, Oracle Solaris and other versions of Unix. ModSecurity is designed to work with the Web servers IIS, Apache2 and NGINX.
* Portmaster — an activity monitoring application by Safing. It is also available for Microsoft Windows.
* Systrace
* Zorp firewall

=== Windows ===

* Portmaster

* Microsoft Defender Firewall

* WinGate

=== Network appliances ===
These devices may be sold as hardware, software, or virtualized network appliances.

<doc id="956502" wikidata="Q5325805" url="?curid=956502" title="Earl Cowper">
<text>Earl Cowper ( ) was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1718 by George I for William Cowper, 1st Baron Cowper, his first Lord Chancellor, with remainder in default of male issue of his own to his younger brother, Spencer Cowper. Cowper had already been created Baron Cowper of Wingham in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England on 14 December 1706, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, and was made Viscount Fordwich, in the County of Kent, at the same time as he was given the earldom, also Peerage of Great Britain and with similar remainder. He was the great-grandson of William Cowper, who was created a Baronet, of Ratling Court in the County of Kent, in the Baronetage of England on 4 March 1642. The latter was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baronet. He represented Hertford in Parliament. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the aforementioned William Cowper, the third Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Cowper in 1706 and made Earl Cowper in 1718. In 1706 Lord Cowper married as his second wife Mary Clavering, daughter of John Clavering, of Chopwell, County Durham.

Lord Cowper was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He assumed the additional surname of Clavering. Cowper married Lady Henrietta, younger daughter of Henry de Nassau d&#x27;Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham, a relative of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau, and a count of the Holy Roman Empire. On the death of Lady Cowper&#x27;s elder sister, Lady Frances Elliot, in 1772, the second Earl&#x27;s son, the third Earl became Lord Grantham&#x27;s heir general, and on 31 January 1778 he was created a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire (&quot;Reichsfürst&quot;) by the Emperor Joseph II. He was allowed by George III to bear this title in Great Britain.

Lord Cowper&#x27;s second son, the fifth Earl (who succeeded on the early death of his unmarried elder brother), was a Fellow of the Royal Society. The latter was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He represented Canterbury in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Kent. Lord Cowper married the Hon. Anne Florence, daughter of Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey and 6th Baron Lucas. In 1859 she succeeded her father as 7th Baroness Lucas. They were both succeeded by their son, the seventh Earl and eighth Baron Lucas. He was a Liberal politician and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland between 1880 and 1882. In 1871 managed to obtain a reversal of the attainder of the Scottish Lordship of Dingwall, which had been under attainder since 1715, and became the 4th Lord Dingwall as well. Lord Cowper was childless and on his death in 1905 the baronetcy of Ratling Court, the barony of Cowper, the viscountcy, the earldom and the Princely title became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Lucas of Crudwell and the lordship of Dingwall by his nephew; see Baron Lucas and Lord Dingwall for further history of these titles.

Several other members of the family may also be mentioned. Spencer Cowper, younger son of the second Baronet and brother of the first Earl, was a politician and barrister. He was the father of 1) Ashley Cowper, Clerk of Parliaments; 2) William Cowper, Clerk of Parliaments, the father of a) William Cowper, Member of Parliament for Hertford and b) Spencer Cowper, a Lieutenant-General in the British Army, who was the father of Henry Cowper, Clerk of the House of Lords; and 3) Reverend John Cowper, father of the poet William Cowper. William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple, was the second son of the fifth Earl. The Hon. Henry Cowper, second son of the sixth Earl, was Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire for many years.

The family seat of the Earls Cowper was Panshanger in Hertfordshire. Other seats included Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire and a townhouse at 4 St James&#x27;s Square.

<text>Count Ardito Desio (18 April 1897 – 12 December 2001) was an Italian explorer, mountain climber, geologist, and cartographer.

==Early life==
Desio was born in Palmanova, Friuli, Italy. He attended the Middle Schools of Udine and Cividale and the University of Florence (1916–1920), graduating with a degree in Natural Sciences (Geology). During the First World War also served in the military corps of the alpini and was captured by the Austrians on Mount Pasubio. He made advanced studies in Geology at the same University from 1921 to 1923, and was also an assistant in that matter at that university, as well as in those of Pavia (1923–1924) and Milan (1924–1927). He was a lecturer in Physical Geography, Geology and Paleontology (1928–1931), Professor of Geology at the University of Milan, and Applied Geology at the Engineering School of Milan (a position he held from 1932 to 1972). Concurrent to these positions, he served as a consultant geologist for the Edison Company for hydroelectric plants in Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey and Brazil, and the same capacity for the Public Power Corporation of Greece. In 1973 he became Professor Emeritus at the University of Milan.

==Exploration of mountains in Europe==
Desio began geological investigations into certain areas of the Alps and Apennines in 1920. The following year, he made some exploratory trips to the Dodecanese Islands. He published a volume on the geology of that archipelago in the Italian Geological Survey.

==Exploration of mountains in Africa==
In 1926, Desio organized and led a geographical and geological expedition to the Oasis of Jaghbub, in the Libyan Desert. The scientific results of these investigations are published in four volumes by the Royal Geographical Society of Italy, the organization that sponsored the expedition.

From 1930 to 1933 he led some geological and geographical expeditions through the hinterland of Libya, including the crossing of the Sahara desert with a large caravan of camels from the Mediterranean seaboard as far as the frontier of Sudan and back through Fezzan, across the Libyan Sahara (summer 1931). The report of this expedition was also published in four volumes.

In 1935 and 1936 he further explored the Fezzan, from both the geological and hydrological point of view, and the Tibesti massif in the Central Sahara. From 1936 to 1940, he organized and directed the Libyan Geological Survey, which included research into mining and artesian waters by order of the Government of Libya. Desio discovered in 1938 natural oil in the subsurface of Libya. In the same years, he also discovered an exploitable deposit of Carnallite in the Oasis of Marada, and rich artesian aquifers in some zones of Northern Libya, which gave a strong impulse to the development of the agriculture. However, further exploration in this region was halted by the outbreak of World War II.

During the winters of 1937 and 1938, Desio explored Wallega and the Benishangul-Gumuz Region in Eastern Ethiopia, both from the point of view of the geology and mining, discovering some new deposits of gold and molybdenite.

In 1940 he organized and directed an expedition to Tibesti, employing automobiles and aircraft. The scientific reports were published in a volume by the Royal Geographical Society of Italy. In the same year, he organized and directed a mining exploration in Northern Albania.

==Exploration of mountains in Asia==
In 1929 he was a member of the Italian Geographical Expedition to Karakoram, under the leadership of the Duke of Spoleto, in the capacity of geographer and geologist. On this occasion, he covered Kashmir and Baltistan in Northern Pakistan, and developed his scientific activity in the valleys of Baltoro and Panmah glaciers on the south slope of the range, and in the Sarpo Laggo and Shaksgam valleys, between the Karakorum and the Aghil ranges, the Abruzzi valley climbing, for the first time, the Conway Pass. The results of this expedition are contained in a volume, which was published under the aegis of the Royal Geographical Society and the Italian Alpine Club in 1936.

During the summer of 1933, Desio led an expedition to Iran. The expedition climbed some of the highest peaks of the Zagros Range including the development of a new route to the summit of Iran&#x27;s highest peak, Mount Damāvand (5,610 m). He published some scientific reports on this trip.

=== First ascent of K2 ===

From 1952 to 1955, he led 3 expeditions to the Karakorum Range and Hindu Kush. The first was a preliminary expedition; the second, the main expedition for the first ascent of K2 (8,611 m, the second highest peak in the world); the third, for geological, geophysical and ethnographical researches. The results of the studies carried out during these expeditions have been published in many papers and more largely developed in 8 volumes of scientific character.

=== Later expeditions ===
During the summer of 1961, he led an expedition to Badakhshan and Katagan (North¬eastern Afghanistan) with a geological and geophysical program, and in the summer of 1962 he led another expedition to the Karakorum Range, exploring geologically the upper Hunza valley and the Chogo Lumba, the Basha and the Hoh Lumba glacier valleys.

In 1967 and 1968 he carried out geohydrological investigations in the Mu River basin (Central Burma) for a UN irrigation project, while in 1970 he developed a geological study in Mindanao (Philippines).

In northern Pakistan Desio carried out three other geological expeditions during the summers of 1971 (Middle Indus Valley), 1973 (Gilgit-Skardu) and 1975 (Punjab and Gilgit).

By invitation of Academia Sinica, in June 1980, after a scientific symposium in Beijing, Desio crossed Southern Tibet with a team of Chinese scientists.

In 1989 he planned, organized and realized a permanent high-altitude scientific laboratory-observatory in a prefabricated glass and aluminum pyramid-shaped structure, which was installed at an altitude of 5,050 m at the base of Mount Everest. The aim was to grant multidisciplinary scientific investigations at high quotient. The &quot;Pyramid&quot; is still in existence and the laboratory still works.

==Exploration of mountains in Antarctica==
In 1961, he was invited by the National Science Foundation to visit Antarctica, particularly the stations of McMurdo, Byrd and Amundsen-Scott at the South Pole, and the Wright Valley, one of the Dry Valleys (Victoria Land).

==Membership and titles==
Desio was President of the Geological Committee of Italy, of the Geological Society and is honorary President of the Paleontology Society, of the National Association of Italian Geologists. He was the first president of the Italian Order of Geologists.

Desio was a member of the Italian National Academy of Lincei. He was awarded an honorary degree in Geological Sciences by the University of Urbino in 1985.

==Final years==
He spent his last four years in Rome, where he died in December 2001, aged 104. He is buried in Palmanova, his native town.

In 1982, the University of Milan named its Department of Earth Sciences after Desio. The Department of Earth Sciences Ardito Desio (DiSTAD) was opened on 1 November 1982 after merging the Institutes of Geology and Palaeontology, the Institute of Mineralogy, Petrography and Ore Deposits, and the Institute of Geophysics together.

<text>Radboud University(abbreviated as RU, , formerly ) is a public research university located in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. RU has seven faculties and more than 24,000 students.

Established in 1923, Radboud University has consistently been included in the top 150 of universities in the world by four major university ranking tables. As of 2020, it ranks 105th in the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities. Internationally, RU is known for its strong research output. In 2020, 391 PhD degrees were awarded, and 8,396 scientific articles were published. To bolster the international exchange of academic knowledge, Radboud University joined the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities in 2016.

Among its alumni Radboud University counts 14 Spinoza Prize laureates, 2 Stevin Prize laureates, 1 Nobel Prize laureate, Sir Konstantin Novoselov, and 5 prime-ministers of the Netherlands, including the current prime-minister Dick Schoof. Other notable alumni include former chairman of Unilever Marijn Emmanuel Dekkers, influential priest and theologian Henri Nouwen, biologist Frans de Waal and First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans. Former students have also won 3 Olympic medals since 2000, all in rowing.

==Coat of arms==

Radboud University&#x27;s coat of arms was designed at the time of the founding of the university by the goldsmith workshop of the Brom family in Utrecht. The lower part represents the coat of arms of the Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The dove in the upper part of the coat of arms is the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The entire shield is surmounted by the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire because Nijmegen was once home to Frankish King Charlemagne. Underneath the coat of arms one finds the university&#x27;s motto &quot;In Dei Nomine Feliciter&quot;, meaning &quot;happily in the name of God&quot;. The coat of arms is used on most of the university&#x27;s official documents, including the university&#x27;s bachelor, master and PhD certificates. For 2023 a special version of the coat of arms was designed to celebrate Radboud University&#x27;s 100 year anniversary.

==History ==

The establishment of a university in the city of Nijmegen goes far back. The first University of Nijmegen was founded in 1655 as the &quot;Kwartierlijke Academie van Nijmegen&quot;. Students developed their skills in the traditional fields of theology, medicine and law. Although the university had its successes, the &quot;Kwartierlijke Academie&quot; terminated around 1680. The university was unable to recover from successive outbreaks of the plague and the French invasion of the Netherlands in 1672.

After several attempts to establish a new university in Nijmegen, the current Radboud University Nijmegen was established in 1923 under the name (Catholic University of Nijmegen). It was founded by the Saint Radboud Foundation, a network of bishops that wished to emancipate Catholic intellectuals in the Netherlands. At the time, Dutch Roman Catholics were disadvantaged and occupied almost no higher posts in governmental and scientific institutions. The establishment of a university was seen as a possible stepping stone for these individuals. When the Catholic University of Nijmegen was founded, every student automatically became part of student corporation N.S.V. Carolus Magnus nl], named after the Frankish king, Charlemagne, who used to reside in Nijmegen in the Middle Ages. This organization was set up to speak for student needs and to organize an annual induction ceremony. It also aimed at attaining the same status as other corporations in the well-known Dutch student cities of Leiden, Delft and Groningen. To the horror of the Catholic University&#x27;s management, Carolus Magnus also pursued the same liberal elitist character as these other corporations. Still, it continued developing and students eagerly participated. In the 1920s it produced its own &quot;sociëteiten&quot;: male students became part of Gentleman&#x27;s Roland Society (1928) and female students joined the Ladies Society Lumen Ducet (1929). Some students of these &quot;sociëteiten&quot; banded together in smaller communities called &quot;disputen&quot;.

=== University in times of war ===
The first years after the establishment of 1923 were quite successful for the Catholic University of Nijmegen, but during the Second World War the young university encountered serious difficulties. Many prominent members were lost, among them the anti-Nazi professors Robert Regout and Titus Brandsma who were deported to Dachau concentration camp and died there. As the war progressed, the university was more severely curtailed in its freedoms. The German Sicherheitsdienst (security service) removed so-called &quot;anti-German works&quot; from the university library. In addition, professors could only be appointed after approval by the Nazi Department of Education, Science and Cultural Protection. Such measures aimed at eventually eliminating religious institutions of higher education. There would be no place for a Catholic university in a nazified Netherlands.

In March and April 1943, the conflict with the Nazi occupying forces reached a boiling point. The occupiers demanded that all students in the Netherlands sign a declaration of loyalty. If they did not, they were not allowed to continue their studies and had to work in Germany as forced laborers. However, students in Nijmegen showed to be resistant to the German demands. At the risk of his own life, law student Jozef van Hövelleven launched a widespread campaign to get as many students as possible not to sign.

The university&#x27;s rector magnificus at that time, Bernard Hermesdorf, decided to show solidarity with students like Jozef van Hövell. As the only Dutch rector in the Netherlands he refused, for &quot;reasons of principle&quot;, to distribute pre-printed loyalty statements to his students. Although heroic, Hermesdorf&#x27;s refusal led to extreme anger among the occupying Nazi forces. On 5 May 1943, the Germans demanded all Nijmegen&#x27;s non-signatories of the loyalty statement to report to Ommen within 24 hours to be put to work in Germany. If they did not, their families would be held responsible. These circumstances left rector magnificus Bernard Hermesdorf with no choice but to close the doors of the university as of 11 April 1943, pending better times. Eventually, only 83 students decided to report to the Germans in Ommen. Most of the students went into hiding, scattered across the Netherlands. The great spider in the web during that time was university moderator Bernard van Ogtrop, who traveled all over the country to visit students from Nijmegen in hiding. He wrote circulars, took care of a wide-ranging correspondence, and ran a parcel service and thus managed to keep many people&#x27;s spirits up. The university was closed, but thanks to Van Ogtrop it continued to exist, if only in the minds of the students.

=== 1945 – 2000 ===
When the war ended in 1945, the university infrastructure had been largely destroyed, but students still returned to their alma mater in dribs and drabs. Classes officially resumed again in March 1946, but because many university buildings had been bombed during the war, a dire need for new facilities existed. With the purchase of the Heyendaal estate, the university got its own campus in a green setting less than a fifteen-minute bike ride from the Nijmegen city center. In 1951, the Faculty of Medical Sciences was the first faculty to move to Heyendaal. Soon, other faculties followed. By 1988, all faculties had moved to Heyendaal. The move to a new campus also with a rise in students attending the Catholic University of Nijmegen. Since the end of the war, student numbers steadily rose from 3,000 in 1960 to 15,000 in 1980.

The period between 1960 and 1975 is often generally described as the &quot;Age of Student Unrest&quot;. Not only did the student population in Nijmegen rise exponentially, it had also become more diverse, left-leaning and less elitist. Next to that, the hippie movement had reached the city which caused many students to desire a more democratic student life. Umbrella organization Carolus Magnus became increasingly bloated and lost connection with the members of &quot;sociëteiten&quot; and &quot;disputen&quot; that began to operate more independently. It was not the beloved corporation it used to be and students criticized the mandatory membership of Carolus Magnus. Therefore, the organization slowly became more concerned with administrative duties than organizing community activities. In 1966 Carolus Magnus ceased to exist in its traditional sense. From that moment on, students were free to choose which association they joined and which not. In the 1980s and 1990s many other kinds of student associations were established in Nijmegen, including evangelical-Christian association Navigators, egalitarian association Ovum Novum, and student association Karpe Noktum&quot;.&quot;

=== 2000 – now ===
As an indication of its evolving relationship with the Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Netherlands and to appear less sectarian, the university&#x27;s executive council changed the university&#x27;s name in 2004 to the Radboud University Nijmegen after Saint Radboud of Utrecht, a medieval bishop. Tensions continued between the university&#x27;s executive council and the bishops&#x27; conference over the secularizing direction of the university. The repeated nomination of non-Catholics and non-practicing Catholics to the executive council, which the bishops&#x27; conference would not approve, exacerbated tensions. In response to a decision to open a Transgender Care Center at the university&#x27;s medical center, the bishops&#x27; conference revoked the designation &quot;Catholic&quot; from the university in November 2020. Accordingly, the university lost its eligibility to receive church subsidies and its right to identify as Roman Catholic. The university appealed to the Holy See, and in November 2022 the pope&#x27;s Dicastery for Culture and Education ruled that the bishops&#x27; conference could remove the designation &quot;Catholic&quot; from the executive council but not from the university as a whole.

== Faculties ==
Radboud University is organized in seven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, medical sciences, law, management, philosophy, theology and religious studies. Each faculty (&quot;cf.&quot;, College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes.

* Faculty of Arts
* Faculty of Law
* Faculty of Medical Sciences
* Nijmegen School of Management
* Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies
* Faculty of Science
* Faculty of Social Sciences

==Campus==


Radboud University is noted for its green campus, often listed among the most attractive in the Netherlands. The campus is located in the southern Heyendaal estate of Nijmegen and houses 7 faculties that conduct teaching and research. In addition to these faculties, the campus also hosts the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, a world class research centre devoted to the understanding of human language and communication.

Featured prominently on the northwest side of the university&#x27;s Heyendaal campus is the Heyendaal castle. It borders the Radboud University Medical Center, a large teaching hospital located on the campus, which is linked to the university&#x27;s medical department. Bordering the university hospital is the Huygens Building, which houses the Faculty of Natural Sciences. At the south end of the campus next to the Radboud Sports Centre (RSC), one finds the Erasmus Tower which houses the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, Theology and Religion. The Erasmus Tower and the RSC border the Elinor Ostrom building, which is home to the School of Management and also encompasses the political sciences and economics faculty staff. On the other side of the Erasmus Tower, a number of general lecture halls is located along with the campus pub and bookshop. Beyond this area, in the southwest of the campus, one finds the modern Maria Montessori building, home to the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Grotius building, home to the Faculty of Law. In the most southern part of the campus, the monumental Jesuit Berchmanianum monastery can be found which houses the university&#x27;s general services staff and will serve as its auditorium.

In 2017, a SPAR minimarket was opened in the Erasmus building which provides students with snacks and accessories. The university campus borders the campus of the HAN University of Applied Sciences, which in turn is located next to Heyendaal train station. Frequent shuttle buses connect the university to Nijmegen Central Station and the city centre.

==Academics==

===Education===

Radboud University enrols over 22,000 students in about one hundred study programs (about 50 bachelor&#x27;s and 50 master&#x27;s programs). As of April 2021, the university offers 34 international master&#x27;s programs taught in English and several more taught in Dutch. There are nine bachelor&#x27;s programs taught fully in English: American Studies, Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Chemistry, Computing Science, International Economics &amp; Business, International Business Administration, English Language and Culture, Philosophy, Politics and Society and Molecular Life Sciences. Communication and Information Studies, History, Psychology and Arts and Culture Studies offer English-language tracks. All other bachelors are in Dutch, although most of the required literature is in English. Some exams, papers and even classes may be in English as well, despite the programs being Dutch-taught. All master&#x27;s programs have been internationally accredited by the Accreditation Organization of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).

====International master&#x27;s programs====
All English-taught master&#x27;s programmes are research-based programmes. They are taught within the Faculties of Arts, Law, Social Sciences, Medical Sciences, Sciences and Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies, besides the Interfaculty Research school and the Nijmegen School of Management.

===Research===
Radboud University is home to several research institutions, including the Business &amp; Law Research Centre, Institute for Management Research, NanoLab Nijmegen, the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and HFML-FELIX. Faculty members Anne Cutler (1999), Henk Barendregt (2002), Peter Hagoort (2005), Theo Rasing (2008), Heino Falcke (2011), Mike Jetten (2012), Ieke Moerdijk (2012), Mikhail Katsnelson (2013), Wilhelm Huck (2016) and Klaas Landsman (2022) won the Spinoza Prize. Visiting professor Sir Andre Geim and former PhD student Sir Konstantin Novoselov were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics.

===University ranking===
Radboud University has been named best broad university in the Netherlands for the past seven consecutive years. The physics department is considered top tier. A recent accomplishment is its contribution to the first picture of a black hole. The Faculty of Law is nationally unrivaled in its research in business and law, and retains strong international ties with other prominent research institutions, such as Bologna, Nice and Oxford. The Faculty of Law&#x27;s European Law School and Notarial Law departments are considered best in class in the Netherlands, just as the Political Sciences, Sociology and Theology programmes in their respective fields.

===Radboud Excellence Initiative===
The Radboud Excellence Initiative was created with the dual purposes of attracting talents from every academic field to Radboud University while strengthening international bonds between universities worldwide. The initiative is a joint enterprise of both Radboud University and Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center. It provides two routes by which a researcher may come to Radboud University. Promising researchers who have completed their doctorate between two and eight years earlier at the time of nomination may be nominated for a fellowship whereas those researchers who are more established in their discipline may be nominated for a professorship.

== Student life ==

===Student associations===

Radboud University offers students the opportunity to join various ethnic, cultural and political organizations, along with numerous honor societies, special interest groups and socially focused student societies.
===Study associations===
Lately study associations have overtaken part of the role that student associations like Carolus Magnus used to play. These study associations are related to individual degree programs and are open to international students as well. Study associations don&#x27;t have initiation rituals and regularly meet for fun-related, as well as study-related activities. Some examples of study associations are the study association for computing science and information sciences students (Thalia), the study association for history students (GSV Excalibur), the study association for English Language and Culture (T.E.A. The English Association), the study association for psychology students (SPIN), and the study association for Business Administration students (Synergy).

=== Campus publications ===
Radboud University&#x27;s independent university media platform, &quot;Vox&quot;, intended for students and staff, publishes daily material online and delivers hard copy magazines several times a year. Its paper magazine is distributed on campus for free. Vox at Radboud University also produce an independent student magazine that appears seven times a year: the &quot;Algemeen Nijmeegs Studentenblad&quot; &quot;(ANS)&quot;.

=== Athletics ===
Radboud University offers many facilities for sports at the Radboud Sports Centre (RSC) a part of campus where students are welcomed 7 days a week to partake in a variety of at least 80 different sports. In addition to the facilities of the Radboud Sports Centre, Radboud University also boasts more than 35 student sports associations such as the Radboud Rangers (baseball), Obelix (rugby), Apelliotes (hockey), FC Kunde (soccer), Phocas (rowing) and De Loefbijter (sailing).

<text>is a sweetener from Japan. A clear, thick, sticky liquid, it is made by converting starch to sugars. is added to to give them a sheen, eaten in ways similar to honey, and can be a main ingredient in sweets. Some are produced in a very similar fashion to corn syrup and are very similar in taste.

Two methods are used to convert the starches to sugars. The traditional method is to take glutinous rice mixed with malt, and let the natural enzymatic process take place, converting the starch to syrup which consists mainly of maltose. The second and more common method is acid hydrolysis of potato starch or sweet potato starch by adding acid, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acids, to make glucose syrup. If done by the first method, the final product, known as , is considered more flavorful than the acid version.

<text>Earl Coningsby was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1719 for Thomas Coningsby, 1st Baron Coningsby, with remainder to his eldest daughter (by his second wife Lady Frances Jones), Margaret Newton, 1st Viscountess Coningsby, and the heirs male of her body. He was the great-grandson of the soldier and politician Sir Thomas Coningsby. Coningsby had already been created Baron Coningsby, of Clanbrassil, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1693, with normal remainder to heirs male, and Baron Coningsby in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1716, with the similar remainder as for the earldom. On Lord Coningsby&#x27;s death in 1729 he was succeeded in the Irish barony of 1692 by his grandson Richard Coningsby, the second Baron, the son of one of Coningsby&#x27;s sons from his first marriage to Barbara Georges. However, Richard died already the same year, when the barony became extinct. Lord Coningsby was succeeded in the English barony and the earldom according to the special remainder by his daughter Margaret Newton, 1st Viscountess Coningsby. She had already in 1716 been made Baroness Coningsby, of Hampton Court in the County of Hereford, and Viscountess Coningsby in her own right. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lady Coningsby was the wife of Sir Michael Newton, 4th Baronet, of Barrs Court and Culverthorpe Hall, Lincolnshire (see Newton Baronets). She had no surviving male issue and the titles became extinct on her death in 1761.

Lady Frances Coningsby, younger daughter of the first Earl by his second marriage, married Sir Charles Hanbury Williams. Their daughter Frances Williams married William Capel, 4th Earl of Essex. Their son George Capel-Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex, assumed the additional surname of Coningsby on succeeding to the estates of his great-aunt, the Countess Coningsby.

The seat of the Coningsby family was Hampton Court, Herefordshire.

==In fiction==
The character of Lady Jane Coningsby in the children&#x27;s mystery novels, the Lady Grace Mysteries, is probably based on Jane, the daughter of Humphrey Coningsby (1516-1559) of Hampton Court in Herefordshire and his wife, Anne, sister of Sir Francis Englefield of Englefield House in Berkshire; and eventual wife of William Boughton (1543-1596) of Little Lawford at Newbold-on-Avon in Warwickshire. She appears as a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth I and friend to the main character, Lady Grace Cavendish.

<doc id="956512" wikidata="Q7448688" url="?curid=956512" title="Sellwood Bridge">
<text>The Sellwood Bridge is a deck arch bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The current bridge opened in 2016 and replaced a 1925 span that had carried the same name. The original bridge was Portland&#x27;s first fixed-span bridge and, being the only river crossing for miles in each direction, the busiest two-lane bridge in Oregon.

The Sellwood Bridge links the Sellwood and Westmoreland neighborhoods of Portland on the east side with Oregon Route 43/Macadam Avenue on the west side. At its east end it leads to Tacoma Street. The bridge is owned and operated by Multnomah County. The original span of 1925 was a steel truss bridge, while its 2016 replacement is a deck-arch-type bridge.

==Original bridge==
Designed by Gustav Lindenthal, the first bridge opened on December 15, 1925, at a final cost of $541,000 (equivalent to $6.9 million in 2011). It was long with of vertical waterway clearance. It had four continuous spans, all of Warren type. The two center spans were long, and the two outside spans were each. The girders from the old Burnside Bridge (built in 1894) were reused at each end. The two-lane roadway was wide, and there was a sidewalk along one side.

In the 1960s, a rebuild of the bridge was proposed as part of an east–west freeway that would follow Johnson Creek Boulevard between I-5 and I-205.

==Deficiencies and replacement==
In the 2000s, discussions began to intensify over the bridge&#x27;s condition, which had been deteriorating since the 1960s. Upon discovery of cracks in both concrete approaches in January 2004, the weight limit on the bridge was lowered from 32 tons to 10 tons. This caused the diversion of about 1,400 daily truck and bus trips, including 94 daily TriMet bus trips. Over the few years that followed, there was debate on whether the bridge should be replaced, repaired, closed altogether, or closed for automotive traffic (but left open for pedestrians and bicycles). In April 2005, Bechtel gave Multnomah County an unsolicited plan to replace the bridge through a public-private partnership.
Discussions over possible replacement of the bridge also considered changes that a new bridge might incorporate in order to make the structure more usable for cyclists and pedestrians than the bridge it would replace. The 1925 bridge included no designated space for bicycle traffic, which had grown in more recent decades, and with only a single traffic lane in each direction, there was also very little room for cars to move over when passing bicycles in the roadway. There was a sidewalk on the north side, but its width was a relatively narrow and the street light foundations shared space with the sidewalk, making the sidewalk&#x27;s usable width at those points about 3 feet (36 inches, 91 cm). Allowing for safety clearances, there was less than 2 feet (24 inches, 61 cm) of usable sidewalk. The Bicycle Transportation Alliance listed the Sellwood Bridge as one of the top ten priorities for improving Portland&#x27;s bicycling.

In July 2007, the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners considered several options for a replacement bridge. At the time, the top option was a bridge with two car lanes and two transit lanes, running just south of the current bridge, with a projected cost of $302 million. In November 2008, however, the Sellwood Bridge team issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement containing details on five different finalist designs and alignments. 
In February 2009, the Policy Advisory Group (PAG), based on recommendations provided by a Community Task Force and the public, selected a Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA). The LPA included replacement of the existing bridge with a new bridge, alignment approximately 15 feet south of Tacoma Street, allowing continuous traffic flow at the crossing during construction, a pedestrian-actuated signal at Tacoma Street and SE 6th Avenue, and a signal at the west end interchange. The LPA is 64 feet (or less) wide and consists of two traffic lanes, two bike lanes, and two wide sidewalks. A final Environmental Impact Statement was published in spring 2010, and it was approved by the Federal Highway Administration in July 2010.

After evaluation in 2010 of several different possible designs, a two-lane steel deck arch bridge was chosen for the replacement bridge. This was approved by the Multnomah County Commission on January 27, 2011. The new bridge is strong enough to carry streetcars and the design will include some provisions intended to make the potential installation of a streetcar line across the bridge easier, should city officials later decide to build such a line. Plans to include streetcar tracks were briefly considered in late 2010, but dropped in January 2011 to reduce costs.

In an October 2011 study, the Department of Transportation wrote that the Sellwood Bridge must be replaced &#x27;immediately&#x27;. On December 15, 2011, the county received U.S. federal funding sufficient to begin immediate work on a replacement. On July 19, 2012, Multnomah County commissioners approved a $299 million design for a new bridge.

On July 19, 2012, a final design was approved by Multnomah County commissioners. The design is a steel deck arch bridge with pedestrian and bicycle lanes on both sides. Construction was funded with $136 million from the county (raised from a $17 annual vehicle registration fee), $33 million from the federal government, $35 million from the state, and $84.5 million from the city of Portland. Clackamas County was originally to provide some funding due to the bridge’s use by many residents of that county, but that plan was later rejected by voters.
On January 19, 2013, the 6.8-million pound bridge was moved onto temporary steel supports by contractor Omega Morgan. The moved bridge, known as a shoofly bridge, served as a temporary span until the new crossing opened. After more than three years of use on temporary supports, the old bridge closed to traffic permanently on February 25, 2016, and the new bridge opened to traffic on February 29, 2016. In between, on February 27, an opening celebration event took place on the new span with access to pedestrians and cyclists only. Crews began demolishing the original railings and bridge deck once the old span closed, with the process completed in May 2016. The steel trusses were then cut into pieces and lowered onto barges using hydraulic jacks, and the temporary steel supports were dismantled.

==Design==

The new Sellwood Bridge stretches a total of across the Willamette River. The deck arch design’s longest span is long and rests on a total of two piers in the water. There are a total of three arches carrying the wide span. The deck carries two lanes of traffic, bicycle lanes in both directions, and sidewalks on both sides. The architect for the new Sellwood Bridge was Safdie Rabines Architects with T.Y. Lin International serving as Prime Consultant for Final Design. The final design reduced the bridge footprint significantly from early concepts, lowering project costs and minimizing environmental disturbances. The final bridge design is also based on contemporary seismic codes and satisfies both a 475-year return period event for operations and a 975-year return period for safety.

<doc id="956518" wikidata="Q4862800" url="?curid=956518" title="Baron Sherard">
<text>Lord Sherard, Baron of Leitrim, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland in 1627. The third holder of the barony would also be named Baron Harborough (1714), Viscount Sherard (1718), and Earl of Harborough (1719), with the viscountcy ending with the death of its original holder in 1732, but the other titles persisting in the family until 1859. The Sherard barony became dormant in 1931 with the death of the last known male-line family member. Many descendants of the Sherard noble family are still living today, with the youngest being born in August of 2007.

==History==
The Sherard family descended from Geoffrey Sherard, of Stapleford, Leicestershire, High Sheriff of Rutland in 1468, 1480 and 1484. His son Thomas Sherard was High Sheriff of Rutland in circa 1495 and circa 1506, while in the next generation George Sherard was High Sheriff of Rutland in circa 1567. It was the grandson of this last, Sir William Sherard, of Stapleford, Leicestershire, who was elevated to the peerage in 1627. His eldest son, Bennet Sherard, who would succeed him as the 2nd Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Leicestershire and served as Lord Lieutenant of Rutland, while a younger son, Philip Sherard, sat as Member of Parliament for Rutland.

Bennet Sherard, 3rd Baron Sherard, succeeded his father the 2nd Baron, representing both Leicestershire and Rutland in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Rutland. In 1714 he was created Baron Harborough, of Harborough in the County of Leicester, with remainder to his first cousin once removed, Philip Sherard (son of Bennet Sherard, in turn son of the 1st Baron&#x27;s younger son, Philip Sherard, MP). In 1718 he was made Viscount Sherard, of Stapleford in the County of Leicester, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, and was further honoured in 1719 when he was made Earl of Harborough, with similar remainder as for the barony of Harborough. All three titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Harborough was childless and the viscountcy consequently became extinct on his death in 1732. He was succeeded in the other titles by his aforementioned cousin.

Philip Sherard, 2nd Earl and Baron Harborough, and 4th Baron Sherard, had previously represented Rutland in Parliament and also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Rutland. Two of his sons, Bennet, the 3rd Earl, and Robert, the 4th, also succeeded in turn to the Sherard barony, while a younger son, Philip(died 1790), was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. Robert was succeeded by his son Philip and grandson Robert Sherard, the 6th and last Earl of Harborough, and 8th Baron Sherard.

Robert was the father of three illegitimate sons by the actress and opera singer Emma Sarah Love Calcraft Kennedy (1801-1881) wife to Captain Granby Hales Calcraft (1802-1856). These included artist Edward Sherard Calcraft Kennedy (1833-1900) and Reverend Bennet Sherard Calcraft Kennedy, who was husband to William Wordsworth&#x27;s granddaughter Jane and father of author and journalist Robert Harborough Sherard the first biographer of Oscar Wilde. Although marrying Mary Eliza Temple (1818-) in 1843 he died without legitimate issue and the Earldom and Harborough barony went extinct.

The right to the Sherard barony is thought to have passed to a distant cousin, descended from the third son of the 1st Baron, though the heirs of that line never attempted to sit and thus the priority of their claim was never recorded or tested before the House of Lords prior to being rendered moot by the extinction of the male line in 1931.

The cousin, Philip Castel Sherard, 9th Baron, died childless, and was succeeded in turn by the sons of his brother, Reverend Simon Haughton Sherard: Castel Sherard, 10th Baron, who was a Commander in the Royal Navy dying in 1902, and Philip Halton Sherard, 11th Baron Sherard, who died childless in 1924. The succession then fell to a second cousin, Robert Castel Sherard, a descendant of the 9th Baron&#x27;s grandfather, and when the latter died childless in 1931, the title became dormant .

<text>Eileen is a comic opera in 3 Acts with music by Victor Herbert and lyrics and book by Henry Blossom, based loosely on the 1835 novel &quot;Rory O&#x27;More&quot; by Herbert&#x27;s grandfather, Samuel Lover. Set in 1798, the story concerns an Irish revolutionary arrested by the British for treason. Eileen, his nobly born sweetheart, helps him to escape by disguising him as a servant.

After two Cleveland performances at the Colonial Theatre on January 1–2, 1917 titled &quot;Hearts of Erin&quot;, the operetta moved on to Boston, changing its name to &quot;Eileen&quot;. It then opened at the Shubert Theatre on March 19, 1917 and ran for 64 performances. It was produced by Joe Weber, formerly of the comedy duo Weber and Fields. It then toured, but a fire destroyed its sets and costumes three months into the tour. The show was not revived in New York until the end of the 20th century. In 1982, a single on-book concert performance was given at Manhattan&#x27;s Town Hall, featuring E. G. Marshall as O&#x27;Day, Judy Kaye as Lady Maude and Roderick Cook as Sir Reginald. In 1997, it was produced and recorded by the Ohio Light Opera. In 2012, a small-scale production was given by the Light Opera of New York.

Herbert was eager to write an &quot;Irish&quot; musical to celebrate the land of his ancestors. His score was well received by the critics, but the libretto received some harsh reviews. Alexander Woollcott wrote: &quot;Mr Blossom [must have] gathered his material and atmosphere by reading for quite half an hour in some public library.&quot;

==Roles and original cast==

*Shaun Dhu, Barry&#x27;s steadfast mate – Greek Evans
*Sir Reginald Stribling, a British Knight – Algernon Grieg

*Mickey O&#x27;Brien – Joseph Dillon
*Dinny Doyle – Scott Welsh
*Chorus of Villagers

==Synopsis==
;Act I
It is 1798, the year of the brutal uprisings of the United Irishmen, who seek to reclaim their lands from the British. Lady Maude, the attractive widow of Lord Estabrook, an English lady, is the mistress of Castle Sligo, once held by the O&#x27;Day family, creating resentment among the Irish locals. Her niece, Eileen, has returned to Ireland after schooling at a convent in France; she is accompanied by the bumbling Sir Reginald. Shaun Dhu leads a band of smugglers and revolutionaries on the Western coast of Ireland that includes Barry O&#x27;Day, son of a legendary Irish rebel. The band stores its loot at Biddy&#x27;s Black Bull Inn in an effort to avoid nasty British tax collector Humpy Grogan. Lady Maude and Eileen stop at the Inn when their carriage breaks down. Barry protects them from some village drunks and flirts with Maude, although it is really Eileen who has caught his eye; Maude is sympathetic to the rebels&#x27; cause. Colonel Lester, the local British authority, comes to arrest Barry for treason, but Lady Maude keeps the Colonel at bay, and Barry escapes disguised as Lady Maude&#x27;s groom.

;Act II
Later, at Castle Sligo, Lady Maude has developed affection for Barry. Eileen explains that Barry is a rogue. Nevertheless, Maude decides to help Barry escape again from the Colonel by putting a coachman&#x27;s uniform on her guest, Sir Reggie, making him a decoy. Sir Reggie is arrested and sentenced to death before the Colonel learns that he has been fooled and that Barry has gotten away again.

;Act III
By the time of Lady Maude&#x27;s birthday, Eileen and Barry have fallen in love. Learning that Barry is there, the Colonel has his men surround the castle. Barry surrenders, and he is about to be shot, when news arrives that the King has pardoned the rebels. The arrest is reversed, various couples are united, including Barry and Eileen, and it is declared that &quot;Ireland shall stand among all nations of the world.&quot;

==Recordings==
The show&#x27;s hit song, &quot;Thine Alone&quot;, has been frequently recorded. Al Goodman&#x27;s orchestra and soloists recorded eight highlights from &quot;Eileen&quot; on a set of 78 RPM records. These selections were later reissued by RCA Camden on one side of a 12-inch LP (selections from &quot;Polonaise&quot; are on the reverse). This album has been out-of-print since the late 1950s. The Ohio Light Opera revived and recorded the musical in 1997, adapted by Quade Winter from Herbert&#x27;s manuscripts, held in the collection of the Library of Congress (Newport Classics NPD 85615/2, double CD, 1998). 

In 2011, a recording starred Mary O&#x27;Sullivan in the title role and an &quot;Orchestra of Ireland&quot; (composed of members of the two RTÉ orchestras) conducted by David Brophy &quot;in a genuinely vital, colorful reading of this luscious score.&quot; (New World Records 80733-2, double CD, 2012).

<text>The Knox Mine disaster was a mining accident on January 22, 1959, at the River Slope Mine, an anthracite coal mine, in Jenkins Township, Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna River broke through the ceiling and flooded the mine. Twelve miners were killed. The accident marked nearly the end of deep mining in the northern anthracite field of Pennsylvania.

== Accident ==
The River Slope mine was leased by the Knox Coal Company from the Pennsylvania Coal Company. In late 1956, with the first lease approaching exhaustion, Knox extended the mine into a new area, much of which was under the Susquehanna. It was legal to mine under the river, but various required precautions were neglected. The thickness of the roof (rock under which drilling was done) was largely unknown. It was supposed to be established by drilling boreholes down from the riverbed. A thickness of at least was considered normal. But the mine was extended into areas where no boreholes had been drilled, and Knox did not drill any new ones. Knox dug chambers beyond what had been requested in the original proposal, without updating mine maps, and chambers climbed toward the surface, to follow the coal seam. Ultimately it was found that the location of the cave-in had a roof cover of only . On the day of the cave-in, the river was dangerously high and icy due to a thaw and heavy rain.

The hole in the riverbed caused the river to flood into many interconnected mine galleries in the Wyoming Valley between the right-bank (western shore) town of Exeter, Pennsylvania, and the left-bank (eastern shore) town of Port Griffith in Jenkins Township, near Pittston.
It took three days to plug the hole, which was done by dumping large railroad cars, smaller mine cars, coal waste, and other debris into the whirlpool formed by the water draining into the mine. Eventually, an estimated of water filled the mines.

Twelve mineworkers died, out of 81 who had reported to work. Amedeo Pancotti was awarded the Carnegie Medal for climbing up the abandoned Eagle Air Shaft and alerting rescuers, which resulted in the safe recovery of 33 men including Pancotti himself. The bodies of the twelve who died were never recovered, despite efforts to pump the water out of the mine. The victims were Samuel Altieri, John Baloga, Benjamin Boyar, Francis Burns, Charles Featherman, Joseph Gizenski, Dominick Kaveliski, Frank Orlowski, Eugene Ostrowski, William Sinclair, Daniel Stefanides, and Herman Zelonis.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
In the months after the hole in the riverbed was plugged, the mine was made safe for entry by sealing the breach. First a cofferdam was built around it in the Susquehanna; then water was pumped out from inside the cofferdam to expose the riverbed; and loam and clay were dumped over the breach. When it was safe to enter the mine, a workforce reinforced the spot with iron bars, built wooden bulkheads, and poured concrete into the prepared area through boreholes that had been drilled in the riverbed. Finally the cofferdam was removed, allowing the Susquehanna to take its course.

Seven people were indicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter as a result of the disaster, including Robert Dougherty and Louis Fabrizio, owners of the Knox Coal Company; August J. Lippi, president of District 1 of the United Mine Workers; the superintendent and an assistant foreman; and two engineers from the Pennsylvania Coal Company. Although some were convicted, the convictions were reversed on appeal.

Twelve persons and three companies were convicted for giving or accepting bribes, or violations of the Taft-Hartley labor law, or tax evasion. These included Dougherty, Fabrizio, Lippi, and two union officials, who served jail time. During the course of his trials, Lippi was found to be secretly a co-owner of the Knox Coal Company, in violation of Taft-Hartley labor law. After the disaster, the widows of the twelve victims did not receive death benefit payments from the Anthracite Health and Welfare Fund for more than four years.

Within months of the Knox mine disaster, large companies including the Pennsylvania Coal Company, from which the River Slope Mine had been leased, started withdrawing from the anthracite business. By the 1970&#x27;s no underground mines were extracting anthracite from the northern field. Anthracite production nationally had been in decline since 1917, with only a small rebound during World War II.

<text>The title Earl Castleton, of Sandbeck in the County of York, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1720 for the 6th Viscount Castleton, who had previously been created Baron Saunderson, of Saxby in the County of Lincoln, in 1714, and Viscount Castleton, of Sandbeck in the County of York, in 1716, both also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The title Viscount Castleton, in the County of Limerick, had been created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1627, along with the subsidiary title Baron Saunderson, of Bantry in the County of Cork, for Sir Nicholas Saunderson, 1st Baronet, who had been created a Baronet, styled &quot;of Saxby in the County of Lincoln&quot;, in the Baronetage of England, in 1611.

All of the titles became extinct on the death of the 1st Earl in 1723. His estates passed to his cousin Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Lumley, who thereupon took the additional surname of Saunderson by Act of Parliament and subsequently succeeded as 3rd Earl of Scarbrough.

<doc id="956531" wikidata="Q960901" url="?curid=956531" title="Ivo Papazov">
<text>Ivo Papazov (or Papasov; ; born 1952), nicknamed Ibryama (), is a Bulgarian clarinetist. He leads the &quot;Ivo Papazov Wedding Band&quot; in performances of jazz-infused Stambolovo music, and is one of the premier creators of the genre known as &quot;wedding band&quot; music in Bulgaria, along with the violinist Georgi Yanev, saxophonist Yuri Yunakov, clarinetist Neshko Neshev and accordionists Ivan Milev and Peter Ralchev. Together with Emilia they are known as Mames 2001. An orchestra that had great success in the TV show &quot;Познай кой е под масата&quot; (&quot;Guess who is under the table&quot;).

According to Garth Cartwright, he was &quot;the first Balkan Gypsy musician to win a wide international following with his two Joe Boyd-produced albums for Hannibal Records in the early 1990s.&quot; Papazov and his Wedding Band have toured the United States several times.

In 2005, Papazov won the Audience Award from the BBC&#x27;s Radio3 World Music Awards.

Papazov and Yuri Yunakov are briefly profiled and the recording of &quot;Kurdzhaliiska Ruchenica&quot; from their 2005 album &quot;Together Again&quot; is analyzed in the popular textbook, &quot;Worlds of Music&quot;, 5th Edition.

Ivo Papazov is a Bulgarian Roma and his original name is Ibrahim (Turkish name). Papazov has stated: &quot;I am one of the few light skinned people in my family but I know I am Romani.&quot; As a result of the extensive programme of forced nationalisation of ethnic minority groups during Bulgaria&#x27;s socialist rule, Papazov changed his first name to Ivo (adapted from Ibo, short for Ibrahim). He speaks Turkish and comes from Kardzhali, a city close to Bulgaria’s Turkish and Greek borders. He grew up in a musical family and followed the Balkan Gypsy tradition of leaving school at a young age, in his case to focus on playing music for a living.

<text>Spring Thing is an annual competition to highlight works of text adventure games and other literary works, also known as Interactive Fiction.

Adam Cadre, author of several works of Interactive Fiction, including &quot;Photopia&quot; and &quot;Varicella&quot;, announced the Spring Thing in 2001, both to promote works that would be longer than those entered into the Interactive Fiction Competition, and to encourage authors to submit works to the general public during other times of the year. It was run in 2002 and 2003, but Cadre did not host it the following year. Greg Boettcher picked up the slack, and hosted the Spring Thing from 2005 until 2013. , Aaron A. Reed runs the competition and has been doing so since 2014.

As with the better-known Interactive Fiction Competition, works submitted to the Spring Thing must be released as freeware or public domain. Unlike that competition&#x27;s limit of two hours per work, judges may spend as much time as necessary with an entry in the Spring Thing.

<doc id="956533" wikidata="Q3012566" url="?curid=956533" title="Dalton Trail">
<text>The Dalton Trail is a trail that runs between Pyramid Harbor, west of Haines, Alaska in the United States, and Fort Selkirk, in the Yukon Territory of Canada, using the Chilkat Pass. It is 396 km (246 mi) long.

Originally, the Chilkat group of Tlingit controlled the trail, which they used for trade with the Athabascan people of the interior. They called the trail &quot;grease trail&quot; after the eulachon oil (extracted from the tiny candlefish) that was the most important item of trade on the Chilkoot side. Each Tlingit chief had an exclusive Athabascan trading partner. Tlingits took eulachon oil and returned with furs, hides and copper nuggets gathered by the Athabascans. Trading parties often lasted a month or more and often consisted of as many as 100 men, each of whom would carry a 45 kg (100 pound) load.

Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Chilkat acted as middlemen between the traders and Athabascans and became quite wealthy.

The Chilkat trade monopoly was broken in 1890 when E. J. Glave, John (Jack) Dalton and several others were hired by &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Magazine&quot; of New York to explore the interior of Alaska. While exploring the Grease Trail, they saw the possibility of a trade route there. Dalton and Glave returned in the spring of 1891 to try taking pack horses on the trail. Glave died a few years later, but Dalton remained in the area. He developed a series of trading posts and, in 1899, began charging a toll to use the Grease Trail, which prospectors called Dalton&#x27;s Trail and later the Dalton Trail. During the Klondike Gold Rush many prospectors walked the trail to Fort Selkirk, where log rafts would float men, horses and cattle to Dawson City.

In 1900, the White Pass and Yukon Route Railway was completed to neighboring Skagway. This ended much of the traffic on the Dalton Trail. The west portion of the present-day Haines Highway follows much the same route as the Dalton Trail.

The Dalton Trail was named after John „Jack“ Dalton (June 25, 1856 in Bruce County/Ontario – December 16, 1944 in San Francisco), the father of James W. Dalton, the famous prospector of Alaska&#x27;s North Slope.

<doc id="956535" wikidata="Q733710" url="?curid=956535" title="Mount Aso">
<text>or [[Aso Caldera|Aso Volcano]] is the largest active volcano in Japan and among the largest in the world. Common use relates often only to the somma volcano in the centre of Aso Caldera. It stands in Aso Kujū National Park in Kumamoto Prefecture, on the island of Kyushu. Its tallest peak, Takadake, is above sea level. Mount Aso is in a fairly large caldera (25 kilometers (16 miles) north-south and 18 km (11 mi) east-west) with a circumference of around , although sources vary on the exact distance. It is one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains.

== Geography ==

The central cone group of Aso consists of five peaks, often called the &quot;Five Mountains of Aso&quot; (阿蘇五岳): Mt. Neko, Mt. Taka (also called Takadake or Taka-Dake), Mt. Naka (also called Nakadake or Naka-Dake), Mt. Eboshi, and Mt. Kishima (also called Kishimadake or Kishima-Dake ). The highest point is the summit of Mt. Taka, at 1,592 m above sea level. The crater of Mt. Naka, the west side of which is accessible by road, contains an active volcano which continuously emits smoke and has occasional eruptions. Only the northernmost crater (the first crater) has been active for the last 70 years—1974, 1979, 1984–1985, 1989–1991, 2009, 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2021.

The present Aso Caldera formed as a result of four huge caldera eruptions occurring over a range of 90,000–300,000 years ago. The caldera, one of the largest in the world, contains the city of Aso as well as Takamori and Minamiaso enclosing the caldera extends about 18 km east to west and about 25 km north to south. Viewpoints from the somma overlooking the caldera are perched upon lava formed before the volcanic activity which created the present caldera. Ejecta from the huge caldera eruption 90,800 years ago covers more than 600 km3 and roughly equals the volume of Mount Fuji; with a pyroclastic flow plateau that covered a significant part of Kyushu.

Volcanic ash from Mount Aso and Mount Kujū plays a crucial role in maintaining and replenishing the tidal flats of the Ariake Sea, which are among the largest in Japan. Several of the flats have been designated as Ramsar sites. The ash is carried from the volcanoes to the coastline by the Chikugo River, which has its source located on Aso as well.

== History ==

The eruption which formed the present somma occurred approximately 300,000 years ago. Four large-scale eruptions (Aso 1 – 4) occurred during a period extending from 300,000 to 90,000 years ago. As large amounts of pyroclastic flow and volcanic ash were emitted from the volcanic chamber, a huge depression (caldera) was formed as the chamber collapsed. The fourth eruption (Aso 4) was the largest, with volcanic ash covering the entire Kyushu region and even extending to Yamaguchi Prefecture.

Mt. Taka, Mt. Naka, Mt. Eboshi, and Mt. Kishima are cones formed following the fourth above-mentioned huge caldera eruption. Mt. Naka remains active today. Aso&#x27;s pyroclastic flow deposits (welded tuff) were utilized for bridge construction in the region. There are approximately 320 arched stone bridges in Kumamoto Prefecture, including the Tsujun-kyo and Reitai-kyo bridges on the Midorikawa River, which are important national cultural properties.

A new eruption began at 11:43 a.m. on 20 October 2021.

==Climate==
With an elevation of ., Mount Aso has a climate that falls as humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with warm summers and cold winters. Precipitation is high throughout the year, which brings the area to have borderline subtropical characteristics as well. It is particularly heavy in June and July, when over of rain fell in each month.

==National Park==
The mountain is a key feature that contributed to the original Aso National Park. Spectacular sights such as the seasonal flowering of &quot;Rhododendron kiusianum&quot; on the slopes of Takadake reflect significant protected botanical ecosystems.

==Tourism==
Aso has been considered as a sacred place since long time ago. It became a mountain for training and worship. Before the Meiji era, there was only one hiking path from Bauchuu, near the current Aso station.

Foreigners visited Mount Aso for the first time during the Meiji era for tourism and research. A new hiking path from the south of the mountain became famous, as more and more local visitors came.

During the Taishō era, the Miyaji line opened. There were more than 100,000 visitors every year. In 1934, the area was established as Aso National Park.

At the foot of the mountain there are also various campsites, and horse riding at Kusasenrigahama. There are also helicopter tours and bicycle tours.

=== Cable car ===
A cable car system, the Mount Aso Ropeway, opened on 10 April, 1958 to provide access to the mountain. The system ran for the last time in August 2014, then closed due to higher volcanic alert level. In 2015 and 2016, the system was damaged by volcanic ash and earthquakes. It was totally dismantled in 2019. From February 2018, a shuttle bus runs from the original station, now Mount Aso terminal to the crater&#x27;s edge .

=== Onsen ===
Because Mount Aso is a volcano, there are many &quot;onsen&quot; hot springs areas, such as Uchinomaki, Asoakamizu, and Kurokawa.

== Hiking ==
Mt. Aso has numerous hiking trails leading to the interesting peaks and mountains around the crater. The Nakadake trail will take you to the highest peak which is part of the active crater and often closed when volcanic gas or volcanic activity is too high. The other surrounding trails offer enjoyable terrain and unique views over the grasslands, the Aso crater, and a small conical peak called Komezuka. Nearly all of the trails (excluding Nekodake) can be accessed from the bus stop at the museum.

== In popular culture ==
In Ishirō Honda&#x27;s kaiju films, Mount Aso is home to the giant pteranodon creature Rodan. In &quot;Rodan&quot;, the creature and its mate perish in the volcano&#x27;s eruption.

Mount Aso serves as the inspiration of Mt. Chimney in &quot;Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot; and the remake &quot;Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire&quot;.

In the manga &quot;Magical Girl Spec-Ops Asuka&quot; by Makoto Fukami and Seigo Tokiya, the final battle of the Distonian War that took place 3 years before the events of the series takes place on Mount Aso.

In the 2006 &quot;tokusatsu&quot; disaster film &quot;Sinking of Japan&quot; directed by Shinji Higuchi, Mount Aso erupts as an aircraft carrying the Japanese Prime Minister flies over it, raking the plane with flying rocks and causing it to crash with the loss of all on board. Mount Aso&#x27;s eruption also destroys the city of Kumamoto.

<text>Yvon Deschamps (born Gougounne Deschamps) July 31, 1935, in Montreal, Quebec) is a Quebec author, actor, comedian and producer best known for his monologues. His social-commentary-tinged humour propelled him to prominence in Quebec popular culture in the 1970s and 1980s. A long time comedian and still active, Deschamps is now perceived the greatest in Quebec history.

==Biography==

===Beginnings===
Yvon Deschamps was born in Montreal&#x27;s working-class Saint-Henri district. He left school in 1951, after Grade 11, and in 1953 found work in the record library at Radio-Canada&#x27;s new television service. It was at Radio-Canada that Deschamps discovered the performing arts; after attending a boulevard theatre piece starring Georges Groulx and Denise Pelletier, he added a taste for the theatre, and enrolled in acting classes with François Rozet and Paul Buissonneau. He took the stage for the first time in 1957 at the , playing Pylade in a production of Jean Racine&#x27;s&quot; Andromaque&quot;.

In 1959, Deschamps was part of La Roulotte, Paul Buissonneau&#x27;s travelling children&#x27;s theatre. The following year he married Mireille Lachance (the two would divorce in 1967). In 1961 he became friends with Claude Léveillée, becoming his drummer, even though the man had actually never played the drums before. In 1963 he formed a company with Léveillée and several other artists at Buissonneau&#x27;s Théâtre de Quat&#x27;Sous. In 1965 he played his first film role in Jean-Claude Lord&#x27;s &quot;Deliver Us from Evil (Délivrez-nous du mal)&quot;, although the film was not released theatrically until 1969.

That same year Deschamps left his short career as a musician behind and opened &quot;Le Fournil&quot;, a restaurant in Old Montreal, followed by &quot;Saint-Amable&quot; in 1966. Both would end up bankrupt a few years later, but while they were open Deschamps hosted his Boîte à Clémence, a boîte à chanson hosted by Clémence DesRochers, participating in the (People are Funny) and (Be Yourself) shows which opened there in 1967. The latter played a special role in his career, because that is where the Yvon Deschamps &quot;character&quot; and his &quot;good boss&quot; role appeared for the first time:)

===L&#x27;Ostidshow===
In the winter of 1968, finding himself broke and occasionally sleeping on friends couches with new girlfriend Judi Richards, Deschamps took a job at the Quat&#x27;Sous offered by his friend Buissonneau. Buissonneau had just lost Michel Tremblay&#x27;s celebrated play &quot;Les Belles-sœurs&quot; to the Rideau Vert theatre, and was looking for a play to finish the season with.

Deschamps proposed a musical review to Louise Forestier and Robert Charlebois with Mouffe on board, and very little rehearsal time. The result would be known as &quot;L&#x27;Osstidcho&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;hostie de show&quot; or &quot;The freaking show&quot;), a show that would revolutionize Quebec song. Inspired by Arlo Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant,&quot; Deschamps made his first real monologue part of the review when Robert Charlebois did not want to learn his lines for the dialogue (he decided to strum the guitar instead). In &quot;Les unions, qu&#x27;ossa donne?&quot; (Unions, What are they Good For?), Deschamps played a naïve worker extolling the great generosity and good-heartedness of his boss, making it clear that reality was not quite so rosy:

:One time, my wife falls sick real bad, so the hospital phoned. It was a quarter past two, the boss answers. He comes to see me, and says, &quot;Your wife is in the emergency ward.&quot;

:He says, &quot;Look, don&#x27;t make yourself crazy about this! Just make like nothing&#x27;s happened, keep on working. If anything does happen, I&#x27;ll let you know.&quot;

:&quot;Not just any boss that would&#x27;ve done something like that!&quot;

Deschamps would write a number of other monologues, including (People are Crazy), (That&#x27;s Really Something), and &quot;La Saint-Jean&quot; (June 24), as well as &quot;Nigger Black&quot; and &quot;Pépère&quot; (Grandpa), both of which went back to the character&#x27;s childhood.

===Glory===
Following the success of &quot;Osstidcho&quot;, Yvon Deschamps&#x27; career skyrocketed. In 1969 he presented &quot;L&#x27;argent&quot; (Money) as the opening act for singer Marie Laforêt&#x27;s tour, then &quot;Le bonheur&quot; (Happiness) at the Théâtre du Canada; these two monologues would become his second album. Deschamps put on his first solo show at the Patriot, where he would go on to appear some 310 times.

In 1970 Deschamps released his third album, &quot;Le p&#x27;tit Jésus/Le fœtus&quot; (Baby Jesus/The Foetus) and appeared more than 240 times at the Place des Arts&#x27;s Théâtre Maisonneuve, where he launched monologues like &quot;Dans ma cour&quot; (In My Yard) and &quot;Cable TV&quot;. The following year another 180 performances were held, including five consecutive weeks sold out.

In 1971 he had a film role in Jean Bissonnette&#x27;s &quot;Hold on to Daddy&#x27;s Ears (Tiens-toi bien après les oreilles à papa)&quot;.

Deschamps presented his shows &quot;On va s&#x27;en sortir&quot; (We&#x27;ll Manage) at the Théâtre Saint-Denis in 1972 and (Women&#x27;s Lib) at the Patriote in 1973 and 1974, giving some 150 performances of the latter show. In 1975, he toured for nine months to put on (History of the Sacred).

In 1977, Deschamps returned with a new, untitled show which would headline for 16 weeks at the Place des Arts and show 102 times over that period. His first daughter with now-wife Judi Richards, Annie, was born. For a brief period he attempted to pierce the English-language market with a California tour, and appeared three times on Peter Gzowski&#x27;s popular CBC programme (one of these appearances is archived in the first volume of his DVD collection), further appearing on the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Save Canada Hour&quot;. He soon reconsidered moving his new family to the United States to essentially &#x27;start over&#x27; and went home to Montreal.

In 1979, he headed back yet again to the Place des Arts, with a difficult show which included his &quot;La petite mentale&quot; (the retarded girl) and &quot;La manipulation&quot; monologues. Deschamps himself called the show a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and would later recall that &quot;they ended up writing off my career.&quot; He had a second daughter, Karine, and came back in 1982 with (We are the biggest crowd alone). Although the public hesitated at first—only 5000 tickets had sold a week before the show opened—the show was very well received; as Deschamps put it, &quot;I got wise and, ten days later, began selling out a room a day.&quot;

The following year Deschamps headlined two weeks at the Théâtre de la Ville de Paris. It would be the swan song of the most fruitful period of his career: seeing a new generation of Québécois comedians like Ding et Dong growing up around him, and troubled by what he saw as a political correctness movement in the 1980s, Deschamps chose 1983 to bow out as a monologuist with his farewell show, &quot;Un voyage dans le temps&quot; (A Journey Through Time).

===Departure and return===
In 1985, &quot;Samedi de rire&quot; (Saturday Laughs), a one-hour variety show with comedic skits and a special guest (musical or other) carried on Saturday nights at 7 p.m. on Radio-Canada. Yvon Deschamps was the host, and appeared alongside Normand Chouinard, Normand Brathwaite, Pauline Martin and Michèle Deslauriers. Among the characters he developed there was the famous storyteller persona of Ti-Blanc Lebrun who would swallow his harmonica before the end of every story and be unable to continue. Seventy-eight episodes and two &quot;best of&quot; recaps would air between 1985 and 1989. Judi Richards and Yvon Deschamps welcomed their 3rd and last daughter, Sarah-Émilie in 1986.

The experience of weekly television allowed Deschamps, now in his 50s, to keep a hand in the comedy business and stay in touch with Quebec audiences, but with a much lower level of stress than his one-man shows had involved. That said, he has presented occasional monologues in between two skits. Deschamps then launched &quot;CTYVON&quot; (ITSYVON) on the heels of &quot;Samedi de rire&quot;&#x27;s success. &quot;CTYVON&quot; was a daily program filmed in a television studio, half sitcom and half parody of other television programs. But the show did not have a chance to find an audience as the at-first-unpopular Samedi de Rire did, with Radio-Canada yanking it off the air after a few months for low ratings(1989–1990).

After eight years away from the stage, Deschamps decided to wade back in one last time with a new show, &quot;U.S. qu&#x27;on s&#x27;en va?&quot; (What&#x27;s Next for U.S.?), performed live 140 times in 1992 and 1993, and broadcast on Radio-Canada television. Following the show&#x27;s success he moved into semi-retirement, purchasing in 1996 the Manoir Rouville-Campbell, a historic hotel property, a Tudor Manor, in Mont-Saint-Hilaire in Quebec&#x27;s Montérégie region. He helped keep the hotel running during the off-season by opening a small nightclub there called &quot;Boîte à Yvon&quot; (Yvon&#x27;s Club) in which he would perform some of his classic and more recent material to the 300-capacity crowd. An album, &quot;Yvon Deschamps au Manoir Rouville-Campbell&quot;, was issued in 1999. Yvon then built a bigger hall called l&#x27;Orangeraie in the Manoir with a scenic view of the manoir grounds and the Richelieu river.

The semi-retirement did not last, either, however. Following pressure from contemporaries and friends, such as wife Judi Richards and Normand Brathwaite, who were adamant that his newer material should be shared with larger audiences, Deschamps got back to work. The result, &quot;Comment ça, 2000?&quot; (2000 Already?), was performed in front of sold-out houses in the Manoir, at Montreal&#x27;s Théâtre Corona and Quebec City&#x27;s Palais Montcalm, then hit the road for a cross-Quebec tour in 2001 and 2002, culminating in the &quot;Comment ca, 2000... 2001... 2002?&quot;

Since 2000, the &quot;Boîte à Yvon&quot; has regularly presented emerging Quebec comedians. In 2001 Deschamps was named a Knight of the National Order of Quebec by Quebec&#x27;s premier, Bernard Landry.

In 2006, Deschamps toured with his wife of 35 years in the show &#x27;Judi et Yvon font une scène&#x27; where they shared the stage equally for the first time. It was a sold-out success.

The Manoir was sold in 2006, but in his 70s Deschamps shows no sign of stopping. As one of the most prolific hosts and performers the &#x27;Festival Juste pour rire&#x27; has ever had, he presented one new or re-worked monologue for each gala show for the festival&#x27;s 25th anniversary in the summer of 2007. They paid homage to him with a special gala.

He has three daughters, Annie, Karine and Sarah-Émilie.

==Style==
Yvon Deschamps&#x27; monologues were known for their unrelenting irony, and often buried a message that was completely opposite to what the stage character was saying literally. For Deschamps&#x27; first monologue, &quot;Les unions, qu&#x27;ossa donne?&quot;, he created an exploited worker who incarnated the Québécois self-image of a historic past as water-carriers and hewers of wood, and who remained resolutely blind to his exploitation at the hands of his &quot;good&quot; boss.

In the beginning, Yvon Deschamps&#x27; never-named &quot;character&quot; was distinguished by his spectacular naïveté, which served as a vehicle for Deschamps to tackle delicate subjects such as racism. In &quot;Nigger Black&quot;, for instance, the character recalled boyhood surprise upon learning that &quot;Nègres&quot; were no more nor less than human beings like him, neither better nor worse:

:Us, we had some on our street; they lived in the same houses we did, went to the same schools. Hey, even some of us had some, there were French-Canadian &quot;nègres&quot;. One of &#x27;em was in my class, his name was Robert. Hey, that was the first time I&#x27;d seen a &quot;nègre&quot; named Robert!

But, very quickly, Deschamps felt the need to go further outside the usual boundaries. His character began to be more self-assured, his remarks more pointed:

:In 1972, I decided to write differently and to stage my theatrical shows. It was all about evoking different emotions in the audiences. Discomfort, too. I yelled at my musicians. I pretended to forget things for five minutes. I once even had the sprinklers go off during a show. Until the beginning of the 1980s, I figured I had to go as far as possible in my live shows. My audiences had seen everything. They left the show with their heads between their legs.

In &quot;L&#x27;intolérance&quot;, Deschamps tried something riskier: going beyond what his audience could possibly accept. The monologue started quietly, after a long introduction and a song (&quot;On va s&#x27;en sortir&quot;, We&#x27;ll Manage), with the character warning the public against the dangers of intolerance, which had caused wars, massacres, genocides and other human follies—all that, punctuated with a diatribe against &quot;faggots&quot;. Deschamps&#x27; character cited as an example the Biafra genocide, where intolerance had resulted in &quot;millions of little niggers dying of hunger&quot;, adding that it didn&#x27;t bother him too much since, after all, these were only &quot;niggers&quot;. At the same time, Deschamps would hasten to add, intolerance had also killed &quot;real people&quot; – the &quot;almost Whites&quot;, which were the &quot;Light Greys&quot;, by which he meant Jews.

:Six million Jews died because Hitler, he did some of that intolerance. He was nuts, a goddamn maniac, you know? Yeah, that guy, Hitler, he said that the Jews didn&#x27;t smell right or dress right, and they had those braids, and they stunk and they didn&#x27;t wash and they bought everything...

:I happen to know they&#x27;re like that, but you can&#x27;t kill them for that! Jews, you just make sure you don&#x27;t have any around you have to deal with, that&#x27;s all.

The monologue continued to unwind, and the character would explain how he had kicked a Jewish family out of their neighbourhood as a teenager, punctuated by exclamations of &quot;damn dirty Jews&quot;. He would push and push until a member of the audience showed some sign of disgust. The character would at that point turn to the audience member and accuse him of showing the same intolerance he&#x27;d been warning the public about for the last twenty minutes. Deschamps&#x27; character would add that an army should really be mounted against the intolerants, ending the monologue with the sounds of a regiment marching, fading into a reprise of the opening song, &quot;On va s&#x27;en sortir&quot;.

Deschamps always admitted being a little bit frightened when he performed this monologue.

==Influence on Quebec society==
:&quot;From Martin Matte to Patrick Huard, many young comedians today see Deschamps as their spiritual father, the man who opened the doors to today&#x27;s comedy movement. A little bit like Michel Tremblay in the theatre, who brought a new generation of playwrights into the world, Yvon Deschamps gave Quebec comedy its stamp of approval.&quot;

:&quot;He&#x27;s a guy who could paint a wicked satirical portrait of our society, then laugh cruelly about our shortcomings. Deschamps said some outrageous things, and they went over because it was him, and we knew that coming from him, there was nothing mean or cruel about it.&quot; — Gilles Latulippe

<doc id="956552" wikidata="Q790654" url="?curid=956552" title="David Geffen Hall">
<text>David Geffen Hall is a concert hall at Lincoln Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. The 2,200-seat auditorium opened in 1962, and is the home of the New York Philharmonic.

The facility, designed by Max Abramovitz, was originally named Philharmonic Hall and was renamed Avery Fisher Hall in honor of philanthropist Avery Fisher, who donated $10.5 million ($ million today) to the orchestra in 1973. In November 2014, Lincoln Center officials announced Fisher&#x27;s name would be removed from the Hall so that naming rights could be sold to the highest bidder as part of a $500 million fund-raising campaign to refurbish the Hall. In 2015, the Hall acquired its present name after David Geffen donated $100 million to the Lincoln Center.

==Renovations==

=== 20th-century renovations ===
The Hall underwent extensive renovations in 1976, to address acoustical problems that had been present since its opening. Another, smaller renovation attempted to address still-unresolved problems in 1992. Both projects achieved limited success.

=== 21st-century renovation ===
Lincoln Center invited nine architects to submit plans for Avery Fisher Hall&#x27;s renovation in 2002, selecting three architecture firms as finalists that June. In May 2004, the orchestra announced that the building would undergo renovations in 2009. Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank, was hired in 2005 to design a renovation of the Hall, but he later resigned from the project. In June 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the construction had been delayed until the summer of 2010. By 2012, the project&#x27;s start date had been postponed to 2017. The shell of the building was to be left intact, and work was to focus on improving the hall&#x27;s acoustics, modernizing patron amenities, and reconfiguring the auditorium.

On November 13, 2014, Lincoln Center officials announced their intention to remove Avery Fisher&#x27;s name from the Hall and sell naming rights to the highest bidder as part of a $500 million fundraising campaign for its refurbishment. Lincoln Center chairwoman Katherine Farley said, &quot;It will be an opportunity for a major name on a great New York jewel.&quot; Fisher&#x27;s three children agreed to the deal for $15 million. In September 2015, Geffen donated $100 million for the Hall&#x27;s renovation, and the Hall was renamed for him. Geffen&#x27;s donation of $100 million was seen as a jump-start for the planned renovation, but on October 3, 2017, the Philharmonic announced that existing renovation plans for the Hall had been scrapped.

In December 2019, it was announced that the plans to renovate the Hall would finally proceed, with construction beginning in 2022. The work included acoustically and aesthetically redesigning it, removing over 500 seats, adding balcony seating wrapping around the entire stage, and making the stage tiered and moving it farther forward. Deborah Borda, the president of the New York Philharmonic, said, &quot;We have to do it right this time, and this, I think, is the plan to do it.&quot; Diamond Schmitt was appointed Design and Executive Architect and led the complete redesign of the hall&#x27;s new concert theater and overall masterplan; with Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects guiding the design of the public spaces. The new design includes a more compact hall, open social areas with bars, and video walls for live streaming performances and other events.

Plans for the hall&#x27;s renovation were accelerated after Lincoln Center closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. In mid-2020, Borda announced that because of pandemic-related cancellations of performances, Lincoln Center would commence preliminary renovation work on the Hall before the Philharmonic&#x27;s planned return to performances on January 6, The orchestra later canceled all scheduled performances at the Hall through June 13, 2021. On October 3, 2022, the main concert hall was renamed the Wu Tsai Theater in honor of a $50 million donation from Joseph Tsai and Clara Wu Tsai. The hall reopened on October 8, 2022, following a $550 million renovation.

==Acoustics==

Architects hired the acoustical consulting division of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) to design the original interior acoustics for the hall. Their acousticians recommended a 2,400 seat &quot;shoebox&quot; design with narrowly spaced parallel sides (similar in shape to the acoustically acclaimed Symphony Hall, Boston). Lincoln Center officials initially agreed with the recommendation, and BBN provided a series of design specifications and recommendations. However, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; began a campaign to increase the seating capacity of the new hall and late in the design stage it was expanded to accommodate the critics&#x27; desires, invalidating much of BBN&#x27;s acoustical work. BBN engineers told Lincoln Center management the hall would sound different from their initial intent, but they could not predict what the changes would do.

The first of Lincoln Center&#x27;s buildings to be completed, Philharmonic Hall opened September 23, 1962, to mixed reviews. The concert, featuring Leonard Bernstein, the New York Philharmonic, and a host of operatic stars such as Eileen Farrell and Robert Merrill, was televised live on CBS. The opening week of concerts included performances by a specially invited list of guest orchestras (Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland), who regularly appeared at Carnegie Hall each season, as well as the new hall&#x27;s resident ensemble. Several reporters panned the hall, while at least two conductors praised the acoustics. While the initial intention had been that Philharmonic Hall would replace Carnegie Hall, which could then be demolished, that did not happen.

Management made several attempts to remedy the induced acoustical problems, with little success, leading to a substantial 1970s renovation designed by acoustician Cyril Harris in conjunction with project architect Philip Johnson. It included demolishing the hall&#x27;s interior, selling its pipe organ to California&#x27;s Crystal Cathedral, and rebuilding a new auditorium within the outer framework and facade. While initial reaction to the improvements was favorable and some advocates remained steadfast, overall feelings about the new hall&#x27;s sound soured and acoustics there continued to be problematic. One assessment by Robert C. Ehle stated:

The seating capacity is large (around 2,600 seats) and the sidewalls are too far apart to provide early reflections to the center seats. The ceiling is high to increase reverberation time but the clouds are too high to reinforce early reflections adequately. The bass is weak because the very large stage does not adequately reinforce the low string instruments.

In December 1977, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine published an article that stated members of the Philharmonic disliked the sound so much they referred to the venue as &quot;A Very Fishy Hall.&quot; In 1992, under the tenure of Kurt Masur with the New York Philharmonic, several solid maple wood convex surfaces were installed on the side walls and suspended from the ceiling of the stage to improve acoustics. The maple was specially selected to minimize its grain pattern. The new components are filled with fiberglass to deaden vibrations.

The ongoing problems with the hall&#x27;s acoustics eventually led the New York Philharmonic to consider a merger with Carnegie Hall in 2003, which would have returned the Philharmonic to Carnegie Hall for most of its concerts each season. However, both sides abandoned talks after four months.

In 2005 and 2006, the Mostly Mozart Festival experimented with extending the front of stage to improve acoustics.

A major goal of the $550 million renovation of David Geffen Hall, from 2020 to 2022, was to improve the acoustics in the main concert hall. According to Zachary Woolfe of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the renovation substantially improved the acoustics, but some significant acoustical problems remained.

==Notable events==
David Geffen Hall is used today for many events, both musical and non-musical. As part of its &quot;Great Performers&quot; series, Lincoln Center presents visiting orchestras in David Geffen Hall, such as the London Symphony Orchestra, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Kirov Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre. The PBS series &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; also features performances from the Hall.

Composer Samuel Barber was commissioned to write his &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; for the opening of the venue, and the work was premiered at the inaugural concert on September 24, 1962 with pianist John Browning. An early television concert from Philharmonic Hall featured Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic in one of their &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot;. It was the first of many concerts televised from Philharmonic Hall, which had been previously televised from Carnegie Hall beginning in 1958. The 1962 program concentrated on concert hall acoustics, and, like the opening night concert, was shown over the CBS television network. It was entitled &quot;The Sound of a Hall&quot;.

It was the main venue for the first New York Film Festival in 1963 and is still a festival venue.

A February 12, 1964 performance by Miles Davis at Philharmonic Hall to benefit the Mississippi Freedom Summer was released on two albums, &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; and &quot;Four &amp; More&quot;.

Bob Dylan performed at Philharmonic Hall on October 31, 1964. The concert was released as &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall&quot; in 2004.

The Supremes performed there on October 15, 1965. The iconic poster for the show was designed by Joe Eula.

Simon &amp; Garfunkel recorded their live album &quot;Live from New York City, 1967&quot; here on January 22, 1967.

In 1995, the star-studded charity show The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True was staged. The show, which starred Jewel, Jackson Browne, Roger Daltrey, and Nathan Lane as the principal characters from the 1939 film, benefited the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, and aired subsequently on TNT, TBS, PBS, and VH-1.

The hall hosted the world premiere of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;War Horse&quot; on December 4, 2011 and the North American premiere of Bradley Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Maestro&quot;, a Leonard Bernstein biopic.

<doc id="956554" wikidata="Q1559179" url="?curid=956554" title="Pro Caelio">
<text>Pro Caelio is a speech given on 4 April 56 BC, by the famed Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero in defence of Marcus Caelius Rufus, who had once been Cicero&#x27;s pupil but more recently had become estranged from him. Cicero&#x27;s reasons for defending Caelius are uncertain, but one motive may have been his hatred of Publius Clodius Pulcher, who two years earlier had passed a law which had forced Cicero into exile, and whose sister Cicero attacks mercilessly in this speech.

The speech is regarded as one of Cicero&#x27;s most brilliant and entertaining orations. It was also famous in ancient times, being quoted by Petronius, Aulus Gellius, Fronto, Quintilian, and Jerome. For modern readers it is of interest in that Clodia has been identified with some probability with the poet Catullus&#x27;s Lesbia.

Caelius was charged with (political violence), one of the most serious crimes in Republican Rome. Caelius&#x27; prosecutors, Lucius Sempronius Atratinus, Publius Clodius (probably not Publius Clodius Pulcher, but more likely a relative), and Lucius Herennius Balbus, charged him with the following crimes:
# Inciting civil disturbances at Naples;
# Assault on the Alexandrians at Puteoli;
# Damage to the property of Palla (little is known of this but it has been suggested that Palla was mother-in-law of Atratinus&#x27;s adoptive sister);
# Involvement in the murder of Dio of Alexandria, using gold obtained from Clodia.
# Preparing poison for use against Clodia.

Caelius spoke first in his own defense and asked Marcus Licinius Crassus to defend him during the trial. Cicero&#x27;s speech was the last of the defense speeches, dealing with the last two charges. The magistrate Gnaeus Domitius presided over the trial.

==Background and trial==
Marcus Caelius Rufus was probably born in 82 BC, at Interamnia in Picenum, where his father was a member of the &quot;equites&quot; (knight) class, a wealthy middle class placed just below the patrician upper class. From 66 to 63 BC, Caelius served a political apprenticeship under Crassus and Cicero. Throughout that apprenticeship, he became familiar with life in the Roman Forum. In 63 BC, Caelius turned his back on Cicero to support Catiline, who was running for consulship. It is unclear whether or not Caelius supported Catiline after the latter had lost the election and taken up arms, but he was not among the people prosecuted for their involvement in the conspiracy.

From 62 to 60, Caelius left Rome to serve with the governor of Africa, Quintus Pompeius Rufus. As a young man, that was a very good opportunity for Caelius to see the world and make a little money. However, Caelius still wanted to make a name for himself in Rome, and in April 59 BC, he brought a prosecution against Gaius Antonius Hybrida, Cicero&#x27;s colleague in the consulship of 63 BC, for extortion. Cicero disapproved of the prosecution and took up Hybrida&#x27;s defense. However, Caelius won the trial and gained recognition among Roman citizens.

As a result, Caelius was able to move to the Palatine Hill, where he rented an apartment from Publius Clodius Pulcher. His apartment was located near Clodius&#x27;s sister, Clodia, who was then 36 and recently widowed. Caelius and Clodia soon became lovers. In late 57 or early 56 BC, Caelius broke from the Clodii for some unknown reason. Clodius and Clodia were determined to punish Caelius for leaving them.

On February 11, 56 BC, Caelius charged Atratinus&#x27;s father Lucius Calpurnius Bestia with electoral malpractice in the elections for praetor in 57 BC; he also insinuated that Bestia had poisoned his wives with aconite. Cicero came to Bestia&#x27;s defense and saw him acquitted. However, Caelius would not admit defeat and made a second charge against Bestia, who was running for the praetorship once again in the elections of 56 BC. Bestia&#x27;s 17-year-old son, Lucius Sempronius Atratinus, did not want his father&#x27;s trial to take place and so he made a charge against Caelius. If Caelius was convicted, he could not proceed with his prosecution against Bestia. Atratinus charged Caelius in the violence court () to prevent any delay in the proceedings of the trial. A certain Publius Clodius and Lucius Herennius Balbus came to Atratinus&#x27;s assistance.

===Charges===
The charges made against Caelius were linked to the attempt of Pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes to recover his throne after being deposed in 59 BC. After he had been deposed, Ptolemy fled to Rome, where he pleaded with the Roman Senate to give him an army so that he might reclaim his throne. However, the Alexandrians were not interested in giving Ptolemy back the throne of Egypt and sent a deputation of 100 citizens, led by the philosopher Dio, to the Senate to hear their case. Ptolemy reacted by bribing, intimidating and even murdering members of the deputation, which angered Roman citizens.

Despite Ptolemy&#x27;s efforts, Dio successfully made it to Rome and stayed in the house of Titus Coponius, a member of the Senate. In 57 BC, the consul Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther decreed that Ptolemy should be restored to the throne of Egypt. However, an oracle was found in the Sibylline Books that forbade Ptolemy&#x27;s restoration, and the Senate was forced to rescind its decree. Exhausted from his attempts to reclaim his throne, Ptolemy retired to Ephesus. In Rome, Pompey waited for the command to claim the throne of Egypt.

In 57 BC, Dio was murdered by one Publius Asicius. The public directed most of their anger toward Pompey, whom they believed to be responsible for the murder. At first, Publius Asicius, who was supposedly an agent of Pompey, was prosecuted for the murder of Dio. However, after Cicero successfully defended him, Asicius was acquitted, and Caelius was prosecuted for the murder.

===Trial===
The actual trial took place April 3–4, 56 BC. The prosecution spoke first, and Atratinus attacked Caelius&#x27;s character and morals, Clodius described the charges in detail, and Balbus spoke against Caelius&#x27;s behavior and morality.

The defence speeches began with Caelius making witty jeers at Clodia. Then, Crassus defended against the first three charges, and finally, Cicero, after dealing briefly with the murder of Dio, attacked Clodia. Cicero&#x27;s speech took place on April 4, the second day of the trial. He made accusations that Clodia was no better than a prostitute and claimed that Caelius was a smart man to disassociate himself from her. By centering his speech on attacking Clodia, Cicero avoided setting himself against public opinion or damaging his relationship with Pompey. In the end, Caelius was acquitted of all of the charges.

===Aftermath===
Caelius was now free to continue with his career. He became tribune of the plebs in 52 BC, and closely allied to the politician Titus Annius Milo, who, despite Cicero&#x27;s famous defence (), was condemned in that year for the murder of Publius Clodius and went into exile. In the following year, 51 BC, Cicero was sent to Cilicia as governor of the province. Before he left, he arranged with Caelius to send him political news from Rome. 17 letters from Caelius to Cicero survive, of which it has been said: &quot;His style is one of the most interesting in Latin literature, vivid, dramatic, elliptical, familiar, and the whole collection is particularly valuable as exemplifying the type of writing fashionable among the bright young men of the day, besides expressing the writer&#x27;s personality in a way that nothing else could do.&quot; In 51 Caelius became curule aedile, and made a vigorous speech arguing against abuses of Rome&#x27;s water supply. Gradually he began to support Julius Caesar. In 49 BC, after voting against the senate&#x27;s demand that Caesar should surrender his army, Caelius fled north to join Caesar. Eventually, however, he fell out with Caesar and died in a scuffle against Caesarian troops in Thurii in southern Italy in 48 BC.

As for the 17-year-old Atratinus, though he lost the case, at least Caelius refrained from prosecuting his father again. He went on to have a distinguished career, becoming Consul in 34 BC, and governor of the province of Africa in 23 BC. He died in AD 7 at the age of 78.

==Summary of the speech==
In some speeches there is a following the but in this speech there is a long section () devoted to clearing away some of the insinuations and aspersions on the character of Caelius made by the prosecutors. The narration is briefly found in §30 and then again in sketchy form in §51.

The speech may be summarised as follows:

Exordium 

1–2 Cicero reminds the jurors that it is a public holiday; the court is one concerning a charge of political violence, but Caelius has not committed a crime within the competence of the court. The real reason for the trial is a certain woman.

Praemunitio

3–5 It is not true that Caelius has disrespected his father, nor that he is out of favour with the people of his home town, who have sent a delegation in his support.

6–9 The criticisms of Caelius&#x27;s way of life in his youth are baseless; Cicero feels sorry for Atratinus in having to make this part of the accusation. In fact Caelius was a pupil of Cicero himself, at his father&#x27;s request.

10–14 Caelius has also been criticised for associating with Catiline; yet Catiline deceived many people, even Cicero himself for a time.

15–18 Cicero claims that it is quite untrue that Caelius supported Catiline&#x27;s conspiracy; Caelius is also innocent of bribery and corruption. There is no proof that he was in debt; and the rent he paid for his house has been exaggerated. It was on his father&#x27;s advice that he went to live in Rome; and it is a pity he did so for there he met his &quot;Medea&quot;.

19–22 The senator who will be produced alleging that Caelius beat him up, and the witnesses who allege that Caelius assaulted their wives after a dinner-party can be dismissed straightaway. The truth cannot be discovered in this way.

23–24 Crassus has already dealt with the other accusations; it is a pity he did not deal with the murder of Dio. But the murder of Dio is completely irrelevant to the present proceedings.

25–30 Herennius&#x27;s speech scolding Caelius on his sinful behaviour can also be dismissed as absurd. Herennius spoke much about the dissipation of young people in general, but the jurors must not let this prejudice them in this particular case.

30–32 The real charges are two: one about some gold, and the other about some poison. Both are connected with Clodia, who is Caelius&#x27;s real enemy.

33–34 Cicero imagines what her famous ancestor Appius Claudius Caecus might say to her: &quot;Are you not moved, Clodia, by the memory of your father, uncle, and other ancestors, both male and female, or of your distinguished husband Quintus Metellus? How come you became so intimate with this Caelius? Was it not just foolishness and lust?&quot;

35–36 Cicero admits that the old man might be equally severe with Caelius; but he says he will deal with Caelius later. For now he imagines what her younger brother Publius Clodius Pulcher, with whom she is so &quot;intimate&quot;, might say to her: &quot;Why are you so worried about losing this handsome young man, sister? You have some gardens right next to the Tiber, where all the young men go to swim: you can pick up another one there any day!&quot;

37–38 How should Cicero deal with Caelius? Should he imagine one of those stern fathers from the comedies of Caecilius? Or should he speak to him like the indulgent father in Terence&#x27;s &quot;Adelphoe&quot;? But could anyone blame Caelius when Clodia&#x27;s behaviour is like that of a courtesan?

39–42 Perhaps people will blame Cicero for Caelius&#x27;s behaviour, since Caelius was my pupil. But that strictness of the past is obsolete these days. A young man should be allowed to have his fling, provided he does not do it to excess.

43–47 One could mention many well-known men who misbehaved in their youth. But Caelius is a man of good character. The jurors should not believe everything they hear about him; these charges stem from Clodia.

48–50 When the lady is of easy virtue, what reason is there for complaint? The jurors can draw their own conclusions from her conduct.

Argumentatio

51–55 There are two main charges, of gold and of poison. Caelius is alleged to have told Clodia that he wanted some gold to pay for some games, but in reality to bribe the slaves of Lucceius, with whom Dio was staying. This can be refuted by hearing the witness statement of Lucceius himself. (&quot;Testimony of Lucceius&quot;).

56–60 As for the poison, why should Caelius have wanted to poison Clodia? There is nothing consistent in the story. And Clodia would do better not to mention poisons in view of the sudden and tragic death of her husband Metellus the previous year!

61–69 The prosecutors allege that the poison was given to Publius Licinius, to be handed over to Clodia&#x27;s slaves in a public bathhouse; that the slaves told their mistress, who arranged for some young men to catch Licinius when he handed over the poison. And yet these men allowed Licinius to get away! The whole thing is a farce. And why did Clodia free those slaves, if not to cover something up? It is scarcely surprising that there was a story in connection with the flask which is too obscene to mention but he is sure the jurors will understand what he means! This story would not have been believed if it did not fit the character of the woman it was told about.

Peroratio

70–80 The jurors can see how Caelius has been victimised. It is quite wrong to accuse him under the , whose purpose is to curb major uprisings against the state, not to satisfy the vengefulness of a woman. He is an honourable and hard-working young man, as his whole life shows. Cicero begs the jurors to preserve him for the State and for his unhappy father. When in the last few days a true criminal such as Sextus Cloelius, who destroyed Cicero&#x27;s house and burnt his brother&#x27;s, has been acquitted, it is fitting that the jurors should acquit a man of good character such as Caelius. He promises that they will reap a rich reward in future from Caelius&#x27;s services.

==Scholarly observations==
===Cicero&#x27;s ulterior motive===
In T. A. Dorey&#x27;s article &quot;Cicero, Clodia, &amp; the ‘Pro Caelio&#x27;&quot;, Dorey argued that although Cicero stressed Clodia&#x27;s involvement in the case against Caelius as an important role, she played only a secondary part. In fact, Herennius stated that the case against Caelius would not have been made without the prosecution against Bestia. Dorey claimed that the prosecution of Caelius was an attempt at delaying the second charge against Bestia, and was caused by Caelius&#x27; new attack against the family of Bestia and Atratinus.

Throughout the speech, Cicero displaced the cause of the attack on Clodia, instead of an attack on Atratinus, to build his defense of Caelius. Dorey claims that cannot be believed, however, because an orator and a historian in Ancient Rome were not the same since an orator&#x27;s job was &quot;to win his case&quot; and a historian&#x27;s was to tell &quot;the truth&quot;. In his article, Dorey claims that the prosecution&#x27;s aim was that &quot;even if Caelius were acquitted, there was the chance of his emerging so discredited as seriously to jeopardize his prospects of success in his renewed action against Bestia&quot;. To do so, the prosecution charged him with two attempted murders. The charges would have been indisputable because Clodia had previously provided Caelius with funds before, and there was &quot;little doubt&quot; that Caelius had taken part in the intimidation and persecution of the Alexandrian envoys; Cicero even admitted it in his speech. Even though Cicero tried to &quot;ridicule&quot; Licinius and the slaves of Clodia&#x27;s rendezvous at the baths to defend Caelius, there was no doubt that the event took place and that &quot;a casket containing some substance to be administered to Clodia&quot; was exchanged.

Dorey argued in the article that Clodia&#x27;s involvement in the trial as &quot;vindictive spite and the desire to revenge herself on Caelius for casting her off&quot; was a part of Cicero&#x27;s strategy in his defense of Caelius. By proving that Clodia was attacking Caelius out of spite, he proved Caelius&#x27;s innocence. In fact, the prosecution&#x27;s strategy hinged on the jury&#x27;s acceptance of Clodia&#x27;s evidence. Cicero&#x27;s strategy then depended on his ability to disprove Clodia in three ways: by proving that the case was brought against Caelius because Clodia was being vindictive, by casting doubt on the reliability of witnesses and by discrediting Clodia completely. Therefore, Cicero unleashed a cruel attack against Clodia in his defense, but the attack had been provoked. Clodia had helped loot Cicero&#x27;s house during his exile after the Catiline events, and in 60 BC, Cicero wrote a letter to Atticus in which he &quot;[indulged] in an extremely lewd witticism at Clodia&#x27;s expense&quot;.

===Identification of Clodia as Lesbia===
Among Cicero&#x27;s orations, &quot;Pro Caelio&quot; is particularly celebrated for its connections to the poetry of Catullus. Popular critical consensus has long identified Clodia Metelli, who features so prominently in the speech, as Catullus&#x27;s famed lover Lesbia. However, recent critics have assailed that connection with various degrees of success. In his book &quot;Catullan Questions&quot;, T. P. Wiseman argues that the identification of Lesbia as one of Clodius Pulcher&#x27;s three sisters is undeniable. The 2nd-century writer Apuleius claimed that Catullus gave his lover Clodia the pseudonym Lesbia; Wiseman traces Apuleius&#x27;s source for this claim to the historian Suetonius, and Suetonius&#x27; sources to Gaius Julius Hyginus&#x27;s &quot;De Vita Rebusque Illustrium Virorum&quot;. Hyginus had contact with several men associated with Catullus, who very likely knew Lesbia&#x27;s true identity. They include Helvius Cinna, Pollio, Nepos, Varro and even Cicero himself. Moreover, scholars agree that the repeated word &quot;pulcher&quot;, meaning &quot;pretty&quot;, in Catullus&#x27;s poem 79 is a pun on Clodius&#x27;s cognomen, Pulcher. Thus, the Lesbius in that poem is Clodius Pulcher, and Lesbia must be one of his three sisters. However, all three sisters possessed the name Clodia and so difficulties arise in proving that Catullus&#x27;s lover must have been the Clodia featured in &quot;Pro Caelio&quot;. The most common evidence for that connection is the implied charge of incest usually detected in Catullus 79 in comparison to the charges of incest against Clodia in &quot;Pro Caelio&quot;. However, Wiseman characterizes Cicero&#x27;s rhetoric as remaining &quot;on the level of mocking insinuation without proof or evidence&quot; and notes that while there were whispers of Clodius committing incest with all three of his sisters, multiple disinterested sources exist only concerning his alleged relationship with the youngest sister, Clodia Luculli. Wiseman concludes that while it is certain Lesbia was one of Clodius&#x27;s three sisters named Clodia, it is impossible to determine which of these she was.

===Catullus and the &quot;Pro Caelio&quot;===
Catullus addresses a Caelius in poems 58 and 100, and a Rufus in poems 69 and 77. There is also a Rufulus (&#x27;little Rufus&#x27;) in poem 59 (although the text is uncertain). Poem 71 does not mention Rufus or Caelius by name, but the mention of a &#x27;he-goat&#x27; (i.e. bad smell) in the armpits of the unnamed lover in poem 71 clearly links it to a similar phrase in poem 69.

Scholars differ as to whether any of the six different poems above refer to Cicero&#x27;s Caelius Rufus. Some, such as Wiseman, argue that none of them are Cicero&#x27;s Caelius, some argue that all of them are, while others take an intermediate view; for example, Austin believes that poem 77 may refer to Cicero&#x27;s Caelius. The Rufus of 77 is a one-time friend of Catullus, who has wronged him by stealing his happiness. Since Catullus and Caelius were of similar character and age, Austin thinks it possible, or even probable, that this second Rufus is to be identified with Cicero&#x27;s Caelius. 

One problem is that the Caelius of poem 100 is referred to as &quot;Veronese&quot;; for Austin and others this rules him out as the same man, since Cicero&#x27;s Caelius is said in the &quot;Pro Caelio&quot; §5 to come from Interamnia in Picenum (but the text is uncertain). Other scholars, however, do not see this as an obstacle to identifying the two Caeliuses. A second, but lesser, objection is that the Caelius of 58 and 100 seems to be a friend of Catullus, whereas the Rufus of 59, 69, 71, and 77 is the target of derision and invective.

Despite these problems, Helena Dettmer believes that the chain of verbal and structural links connecting the six poems makes it clear that they all form part of a single cycle, and that they all refer to the same man, Cicero&#x27;s Caelius Rufus. She also argues that the parallels between poems 58 and 59 indicate that the &quot;Rufa the Bononian&quot; (i.e. from Bologna) is a pseudonym for Lesbia. If this is correct, it appears that Catullus and Caelius were close friends until Caelius angered Catullus by stealing Lesbia from him.

Another poem of interest for this identification is 49, which is addressed to Cicero. Dettmer points out that the striking phrase &#x27;grandsons of Romulus&#x27; at the beginning of 49 links it to &#x27;grandsons of Remus&#x27; at the end of 58, while the word &#x27;patron&#x27; at the end of 49 links it to &#x27;Caelius&#x27; at the beginning of 58. Thus the Caelius of poem 58 is the Caelius defended by Cicero in the year 56 BC.

It has also been suggested that the &#x27;evil beast&#x27; of poem 69 (referring again to the &quot;goat&quot; or bad smell of Rufus&#x27;s armpits), which Catullus urges Rufus to kill, is a pun on the name of Calpurnius Bestia, whom Caelius had attacked in a court case earlier in the year 56 BC.

===Accusations of Clodia&#x27;s incest in Cicero and Catullus===
One major potential connection between Lesbia and Clodia is the similarity between implications of incest apparent in Catullus 79 and the Cicero&#x27;s charges of incest in the &quot;Pro Caelio&quot;. However, the association is weakened somewhat by James L. Butrica&#x27;s argument in &quot;Clodius the Pulcher in Catullus and Cicero&quot;. He emphasises the prominence of the word &quot;pulcher&quot; in Catullus&#x27;s poem and acknowledges that it identifies the character Lesbius with Clodius Pulcher and Lesbia with Clodia. However, he goes on to argue that there are no overtones of incest in the poem. Rather, Catullus&#x27;s reference to the reluctance of Clodius&#x27;s associates to exchange with him a common social kiss implies connotations of fellatio. Butrica goes on to cite the 4th-century commentator Maurus Servius Honoratus, who noted that the word &quot;pulcher&quot; was sometimes used as an ironic euphemism for the word &quot;exoletus&quot;, which were Roman males raised as sex slaves from boyhood. &quot;Exoleti&quot; were characterised by effeminacy, sexual passivity, immorality and an insatiable carnal appetite. Thus, Butrica argues that the twist in Catullus 79 is the pun on Clodius&#x27;s cognomen with a synonym for &quot;exoletus&quot;, and he connects that characterisation with fragments of lost Cicero speeches that attribute similar qualities to Clodius Pulcher. Butrica admits that the accusations of incest in the &quot;Pro Caelio&quot; are explicitly clear, but he characterises them as an escalation in Cicero&#x27;s rhetoric against Clodius that go from merely mocking his sexual passivity to making serious charges of illegal sexual conduct with his own sister.

===Cicero&#x27;s use of tragedy===
A. S. Hollis points out in an article written in 1998 that Cicero uses subtle references to popular tragedies that circulated around Rome at the time that &quot;Pro Caelio&quot; was given. For instance, Hollis quotes Cicero&#x27;s use of &quot;equus Troianus&quot; and &quot;muliebre bellum&quot;, both of which were titles of popular tragedies contemporary with Cicero&#x27;s oration. In fact, &quot;Equus Troianus&quot; was the name of the tragedy performed at the opening of Pompey&#x27;s Theater just a couple years after &quot;Pro Caelio&quot; was given, as Hollis points out. There are a number of much more overt tragic metaphors that Cicero inserts into his oration. The most obvious is, of course, during the course of his vociferous assaults on Clodia, Cicero often compares her to Medea and also Clytemnestra. Finally, there are a few lines of Cicero&#x27;s speech that Hollis identifies as being able to be syllabified into iambic line form and so there is even greater subtlety to Cicero&#x27;s tragic references.

===Cicero as patron, Cicero as father?===
James M. May demonstrates Cicero&#x27;s use of father/son imagery that is so prevalent in Cicero&#x27;s speech, as it overlays the court room realities of Roman law, namely the patron-client relationship. From the beginning of the speech, Cicero&#x27;s defense begins to present Caelius as if he were his son. May identifies and elaborates on what he views as the &quot;boys will be boys&quot; defense inherent to Cicero&#x27;s argument. Cicero must first present Clodia as an unchaste, promiscuous woman, and he accomplishes that by his use of language associated with prostitution while he describes her. Caelius&#x27;s relationship with her as the result of the former&#x27;s naïveté and her seductive amoral ways. Earlier in the speech, Cicero carefully uses his advanced age and lofty reputation as an orator to defuse the usefulness of the arguments made by Atratinus, who was only 17 years old when he participated in the prosecution. Also, Cicero can defuse the connection between Caelius and Catiline by presenting the former as the rebellious son who had been seduced into false ways by corrupting influences. Finally, Cicero completes his destruction of the Caelius/Catiline connection by pronouncing that Caelius had nearly joined with Catiline, as May is quick to point out: &quot;like father, like son!&quot;

===Domus motif===
Anne Leen&#x27;s article &quot;Clodia Oppugnatrix: The Domus Motif in Cicero&#x27;s Pro Caelio&quot; argued that Cicero&#x27;s use of the Roman institution of the domus, or home, established the respectable reputation of Caelius and the ghastly reputation of Clodia. The domus in Latin literature &quot;is charged with precisely gendered social, cultural, and political significance&quot;. It is mentioned within the speech at least 27 times. Clodia&#x27;s house is mentioned the most and it &quot;a problematized space in which traditional Roman expectations of domestic behavior are egregiously violated&quot;. Leen then argued that to be a strategy of Cicero in which he attacked Clodia and defended Caelius. Each time that the domus is mentioned, the actual home should be understood as well as the immediate family and extended family. The décor and visitors of the domus and the family determined the owner&#x27;s reputation, power and prestige in Republican Rome. Throughout the speech, Cicero resurrected Caelius&#x27;s reputation by repeatedly placing him in prestigious Roman domus such as the homes of Crassus and Cicero.

In Latin literature, the domus was the sphere of influence for women that displayed the Roman qualities of &quot;chastity, fidelity, and wifely obedience&quot; to the husband. Clodia&#x27;s household was, by default, in the wrong because there was no male present. Throughout the speech, Cicero did not try to disprove the allegations completely that Clodia had brought against Caelius, but he aimed to disprove her through destroying her reputation with the domus imagery. When Cicero described Clodia&#x27;s household, he never mentioned Caelius being at her house at the same time as her. By doing so, Cicero cast Caelius on the &quot;positive side of Roman values&quot; and put Clodia in an &quot;abyss of sexual license and its metonymic counterparts, public chaos and political anarchy&quot;.

Cicero also brought the history of the Clodian family into his speech to discredit Clodia by contrasting Clodia&#x27;s present behavior with the behaviour of her &quot;great Republican lineages&quot;.

Men in Ancient Rome were to have a full, busy household; however, women were not supposed to have a busy household like Clodia&#x27;s domus. Her household reflected &quot;personal disrepute, sexual misconduct, and social disorder&quot;. By having her own household, she was taking what was rightly owned by men in Ancient Rome and so she blurred the lines between men and women. Cicero claimed that was a threat to the Republic as a whole. Cicero then claimed that Clodia created these charges against Caelius and attacked the reputation of Lucceius, who was living in Dio&#x27;s domus. Insulting a guest would hurt the host&#x27;s reputation, and Cicero did not let Clodia forget that she had done so. Through Cicero&#x27;s attack of Clodia, Caelius was established as the innocent victim; his innocence essentially convicted Clodia of the murder of Dio. Leen argued that the domus had developed a conscience through the ordeal, aided and abetted Clodia through the murder of Dio and convicted her of the crime afterwards. However, Cicero did not let the jury forget that he was the best witness of Clodia&#x27;s schemes by telling his story at the end of the speech. His once-great house, which housed Caelius first, no longer existed after Clodia.

<text>Sakurajima (, ) is an active stratovolcano, formerly an island and now a peninsula, in Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan. The lava flows of the 1914 eruption connected it with the Ōsumi Peninsula. It is the most active volcano in Japan.

, the volcanic activity still continues, dropping volcanic ash on the surroundings. Earlier eruptions built the white sand highlands in the region. On September 13, 2016, a team of experts from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre in Japan suggested that the volcano could have a major eruption within 30 years; since then two eruptions have occurred.

Sakurajima is a stratovolcano. Its summit has three peaks, &quot;Kita-dake&quot; (northern peak), &quot;Naka-dake&quot; (central peak) and &quot;Minami-dake&quot; (southern peak) which is active now.

Kita-dake is Sakurajima&#x27;s highest peak, rising to above sea level. The mountain is in a part of Kagoshima Bay known as Kinkō-wan. The former island is part of the city of Kagoshima which is only 4km across the bay. The surface of this volcanic peninsula is about .

Sakurajima has a population of a few thousand residents, formerly incorporated as Sakurajima town, with a number of schools, shrines, and shops on the island. It is serviced by the Sakurajima Ferry which runs 24/7. It is a tourist destination known for its onsen, local pottery made from volcanic ash, and produce such as the Sakurajima daikon radish and Sakurajima komikan orange which grow in the immensely fertile volcanic soil.

Sakurajima has many natural areas and the ecosystems in different areas where recent eruptions have taken place have been researched as an example of ecological succession.

==History==

===Geological history===
Sakurajima is in the 25 km (15 mi)-wide Aira caldera, which formed in an enormous &quot;blow-out-and-cave-in&quot; eruption around 22,000 years ago. Several hundred cubic kilometres of ash and pumice were ejected, causing the magma chamber underneath the erupting vents to collapse. The resulting caldera is over across. Tephra fell as far as from the volcano. Sakurajima is a modern active vent of the same Aira caldera volcano.

Sakurajima was formed by later activity within the caldera, beginning about 13,000 years ago. It is about south of the centre of the caldera. Its first eruption in recorded history was in 963 AD. Most of its eruptions are Strombolian, affecting only the summit areas, but larger Plinian eruptions have occurred in 1471–1476, 1779–1782 and 1914.

Volcanic activity at &quot;Kita-dake&quot; ended around 4,900 years ago: later eruptions have been centered on &quot;Minami-dake&quot;. Since 2006, activity has centred on Showa crater, to the east of the summit of Minami-dake.

===1914 eruption===

The 1914 eruption began on January 11 and was the most powerful in twentieth-century Japan. The volcano had been dormant for over a century until 1914. 
Almost all residents had left the island in the previous days; several large earthquakes had warned them that an eruption was imminent.
Initially, the eruption was very explosive, generating eruption columns and pyroclastic flows, but after a very large earthquake on January 12, and another the day after, it became effusive, generating a large lava flow. The January 12 earthquake killed 35, and in total, 58 people died. Lava flows filled the narrow strait between the island and the mainland, turning it into a peninsula.
Lava flows are rare in Japan—because the silica content of the magmas is high, explosive eruptions are far more common—but the lava flows at Sakurajima continued for months.
The island grew, engulfing several smaller islands nearby, and eventually became connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. Parts of Kagoshima Bay became significantly shallower, and it made tides higher.

During the last stages of the eruption, emptying of the underlying magma chamber sank the centre of the Aira Caldera by about . This showed that Sakurajima draws its magma from the same magma reservoir that fed the ancient caldera-forming eruption. The eruption partly inspired a 1914 movie, &quot;The Wrath of the Gods&quot;, centering on a family curse that ostensibly causes the eruption.

===Recent activity===

Sakurajima&#x27;s activity became more prominent in 1955, and the volcano has been erupting almost constantly ever since. Thousands of small explosions happen each year, throwing ash to heights of up to a few kilometers above the mountain. The Sakurajima Volcano Observatory was set up in 1960 to monitor these eruptions.

Monitoring of the volcano and predictions of large eruptions are particularly important because it is in a densely populated area, with the city of Kagoshima&#x27;s 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from the volcano. The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where people can take refuge from falling volcanic debris.

In light of the dangers it presents to nearby populations, Sakurajima was designated a Decade Volcano in 1991, identifying it as worthy of particular study as part of the United Nations&#x27; International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.

Sakurajima is part of the Kirishima-Yaku National Park, and its lava flows are a major tourist attraction. The area around Sakurajima contains several hot spring resorts. One of the main agricultural products of Sakurajima is a huge basketball-sized white radish (&quot;Sakurajima daikon&quot;).

On March 10, 2009, Sakurajima erupted, sending debris up to . An eruption had been expected following a series of smaller explosions over the weekend. It is not thought there was any damage caused.

An eruption occurred from the Minami-dake summit crater at 5:38 on Sunday, August 9, 2010, sending debris up to 5000 m (16,000 ft).

In 2011 and 2012, Sakurajima experienced several significant eruptions; volcanic activity continued into 2013.
Photographer Martin Rietze captured a rare picture of lightning within the ash plume in January 2013 during a magma ejection, which was a NASA astronomy pic of the day in March 2013.

On August 18, 2013, the volcano erupted from Showa crater and produced its highest recorded plume of ash since 2006, rising 5,000 metres high and causing darkness and significant ash falls on the central part of Kagoshima city. The eruption occurred at 16:31 and was the 500th eruption of the year.

In August 2015, Japan&#x27;s meteorological agency issued a level 4 emergency warning, which urges residents to prepare to evacuate.
Scientists warned that a major eruption could soon take place at the volcano; it eventually did erupt around 20:00 on February 5, 2016.

After a long pause of eruptions at the vent, the eruptions abruptly stopped there and returned to the Showa crater, on April 4, 2016, some 8–9 days preceding major earthquakes on the Median Tectonic Line near Kumamoto, Japan. Then, three months later, on July 26, it spewed volcanic ash into the air.

On October 3, 2020, at 07:35 UTC, the volcano erupted once again, this time from the Aira caldera. A volcanic ash advisory for aviation was issued by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center Tokyo (VAAC) at 07:43 UTC, showing the ash cloud to be stationary and reaching FL100 (10,000 feet).

On July 24, 2022, at 20:05 JST, an explosive eruption occurred at the summit crater of the volcano, and cinders scattered up to 2.5 km from the crater. Following this eruption, at 20:50 JST, the Japan Meteorological Agency raised the eruption alert level from Level 3 to Level 5, the highest level, and urged maximum precaution and evacuation. This was the first time an eruption alert level 5 has been issued for Sakurajima.

On February 9, 2023, an eruption occurred at the Showa crater on Sakurajima at 10:52 JST. The plumes had risen to 1000 meters at 11:10 JST, according to the Kagoshima Meteorological Office. People in a 2-km radius were sent a warning by the local weather observatory against pyroclastic flows and falling rocks.

On February 14, 2024, an eruption occurred at the Minamidake crater on Sakurajima at 18:33 JST, emitting plumes of over five kilometers in height and spewing rocks as far as 1.3 kilometers away.

==Culture==

&quot;Sakurajima&quot; is the title of a 1946 short story, written by the Japanese writer Haruo Umezaki, about a disillusioned Navy officer stationed on the volcano island towards the end of World War II as American air force planes bomb Japan. The story is based on Umezaki&#x27;s own experience; he was stationed in a military cipher base in the nearby Prefecture city of Kagoshima.

&quot;Sakurajima&quot; was also the name of Japanese singer Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi&#x27;s song. In 2004, Nagabuchi held an at a quarry of Sakurajima that attracted an audience of 75,000. After the concert, a statue showing Nagabuchi screaming with a guitar was installed on the site of the concert.

<doc id="956561" wikidata="Q770668" url="?curid=956561" title="Chris Hillman">
<text>Christopher Hillman (born December 4, 1944) is an American musician. He was the original bassist of the Byrds. With frequent collaborator Gram Parsons, Hillman was a key figure in the development of country rock, defining the genre through his work with the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Manassas and the country-rock group the Desert Rose Band. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Byrds.

==Early life==
Hillman was born in Los Angeles, California, the third of four children. He spent his early years at his family&#x27;s ranch home in rural northern San Diego County, approximately from Los Angeles. He has credited his older sister with exciting his interest in country and folk music, when she returned from college during the late 1950s with folk music records by The New Lost City Ramblers and others. Hillman soon began watching many of the country-music shows on local television in southern California at the time such as &quot;Town Hall Party&quot;, &quot;The Spade Cooley Show&quot; and &quot;Cal&#x27;s Corral&quot;. Hillman&#x27;s mother encouraged his musical interests and bought him his first guitar; shortly thereafter he developed an interest in bluegrass, particularly the mandolin. At the age of 15, Hillman went to Los Angeles to see the Kentucky Colonels bluegrass band at the Ash Grove, and later convinced his family to allow him to travel by train to Berkeley for lessons from mandolinist Scott Hambly. When Chris was 16, his father committed suicide.

Hillman became known in San Diego&#x27;s folk music community as a solid player; this won him an invitation to join his first band, the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. The band lasted barely two years, recording only one album (&quot;Blue Grass Favorites&quot;, which was distributed in supermarkets); however, it has a posthumous reputation as the spawning ground for a number of musicians who went on to play in the Eagles, the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, Hearts &amp; Flowers, and the Country Gazette. When the band broke up in late 1963 Hillman received an invitation to join the Golden State Boys, regarded as the top bluegrass band in southern California and featuring future country star Vern Gosdin, his brother Rex and banjoist Don Parmley (later of the Bluegrass Cardinals). Shortly thereafter the band changed its name to The Hillmen; soon Hillman was appearing regularly on television and using a fictitious ID, &quot;Chris Hardin&quot;, to allow the underage musician into the country bars where many of his gigs were played. When the Hillmen folded, he briefly joined a spinoff of Randy Sparks&#x27; New Christy Minstrels known as the Green Grass Revival.

== Career ==

=== The Byrds (1964–1968) ===
At this point a frustrated Hillman considered quitting music and enrolling at UCLA when he received an offer from The Hillmen&#x27;s former manager and producer, Jim Dickson, to join Jim (later Roger) McGuinn, David Crosby, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke in a new band, The Byrds. Hillman was recruited to play bass guitar, although he had never picked up the instrument. Thanks to his bluegrass background, he quickly developed his own melodic style on the instrument. The Byrds&#x27; first single, a jangly cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, was an international hit and marked the birth of folk rock. During the mid-1960s the Byrds ranked as one of the most successful and influential American pop groups; they recorded a string of hits, including &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;, and &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;.

Hillman kept a low profile on the band&#x27;s first two albums, on which McGuinn and Clark shared lead vocals with Crosby adding high harmony and singing the bridge on &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;. However, Clark&#x27;s departure in 1966 and Crosby&#x27;s growing restlessness allowed Hillman the opportunity to develop as a singer and songwriter in the group. He came into his own on the Byrds&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;, co-writing and sharing lead vocals with McGuinn on the hit &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;. Hillman also wrote (and sang) the minor hit &quot;Have You Seen Her Face&quot;, &quot;Thoughts and Words&quot;, &quot;Time Between&quot; and &quot;The Girl with No Name&quot;, the latter two demonstrating his bluegrass and country roots. Hillman&#x27;s prominence continued with the Byrds&#x27; next album, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;, on which he shared songwriting credit on seven of the album&#x27;s eleven songs.

=== Pioneering country rock ===
Internal strife dogged the Byrds, and by the beginning of 1968 the band was down to two original members (Hillman and McGuinn), with Hillman&#x27;s cousin Kevin Kelley on drums. They then hired Gram Parsons to replace Crosby. Hillman, who had brought country music into the Byrds&#x27; earliest recording of &quot;Satisfied Mind&quot;, found another lover of country music in Parsons. &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and continues to inspire musicians in the Americana format. Parsons left the band shortly thereafter; Hillman brought in former Kentucky Colonels guitarist Clarence White as a replacement and White suggested that the group replace Kelley with Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram) on drums, but this line-up was short-lived and Hillman himself left the Byrds due to financial misappropriation by their management.

=== The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969–1972) ===

Hillman teamed with Gram Parsons again (this time as vocalist, guitarist and songwriter) to form the Flying Burrito Brothers. Further honing their pioneering country-rock hybrid sound by combining the energy, instrumentation and attitude of rock and roll with the issues and themes of country music, the Burritos recorded the landmark &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; (1969) followed by 1970&#x27;s &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot;. Parsons was fired from the line-up by June 1970 (replaced by guitarist Rick Roberts) when the band toured Canada as part of the Festival Express tour, with Hillman reverting to bass guitar. Hillman stayed with the band for two more records, &quot;The Flying Burrito Brothers&quot; and &quot;Last of the Red Hot Burritos&quot;.

=== Various bands and solo career (1970s) ===

Before the Flying Burrito Brothers disbanded, Hillman joined Stephen Stills&#x27; band Manassas. They released two albums, a 1972 self-titled double album, and a 1973 album &quot;Down the Road&quot;. Led by Stills, Manassas was an exploration into a mixture of rock, country, blues, bluegrass and Latin music. In 1972, Stills gave Hillman a 1924 Lloyd Loar Gibson F-5 mandolin. Hillman remained with Manassas until 1973, when he briefly re-joined the original line-up of the Byrds for a reunion album on Asylum Records.

In 1974, Hillman teamed with singer-songwriter Richie Furay (who co-founded Buffalo Springfield and Poco) and songwriter JD Souther (who co-wrote much of the Eagles&#x27; early repertoire) in the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band. The trio never quite gelled, and broke up in 1975 after two albums and internal squabbles.

Hillman released two solo albums, &quot;Slippin&#x27; Away&quot; and &quot;Clear Sailin&quot;&#x27;, which included several songs co-written with &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; magazine editor Peter Knobler. One of their songs, &quot;Step on Out,&quot; was recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys on their 1985 album and became the title cut. He was also an in-demand studio musician, playing and singing on sessions for Gene Clark, Dillard &amp; Clark, Poco, Dan Fogelberg and others. After an early 1977 UK tour reunited him with Roger McGuinn and Gene Clark, the trio stayed together as McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman for two albums (on which Hillman continued his songwriting collaboration with Knobler) and one under the McGuinn-Hillman name, with a hit single in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Write Her Off&quot;.

=== The Desert Rose Band (1985–1994, 2008) ===

By the early 1980s Hillman had returned to his bluegrass and country roots, recording two acclaimed (mainly acoustic) albums for Sugar Hill Records with singer/guitarist/banjo player Herb Pedersen (a former member of The Dillards). Soon after, Hillman and Pedersen formed the Desert Rose Band; this proved to be Hillman&#x27;s most commercially successful post-Byrds project. Their self-titled debut album in 1987 generated two Top Ten country hits in &quot;Love Reunited&quot; (written with Steve Hill), &quot;One Step Forward&quot; and the number-one single &quot;He&#x27;s Back and I&#x27;m Blue.&quot; From 1987 until late 1993 the band recorded five albums and one Greatest Hits package and had a string of 16 country-music hits (the majority of which were in the country Top Ten) and a number of Academy of Country Music awards before disbanding in 1994. As Hillman said, &quot;We definitely quit while we were ahead.&quot;

Chris Hillman, Herb Pedersen, JayDee Maness, John Jorgenson, Bill Bryson, and Steve Duncan performed their first reunion concert on August 27, 2008 in Solana Beach, CA. Before this date Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen were as a duo joined by John Jorgenson on May 2, 2008 for a small DRB set at the Station Inn in Nashville. This six-man lineup is the best known, and includes all of the original members present on the hit albums from the 1980s. At this show, Hillman said it was the first time they had played together in 19 years. They went through a string of DRB hits but were unable to play &quot;He&#x27;s Back and I&#x27;m Blue&quot; because Hillman said he had forgotten the words. This sold-out show prompted Hillman and the band to play a handful of other reunion shows at music festivals throughout the U.S. Several of these were recorded for inclusion on a live album, which Hillman hopes to release in the U.S. and Europe. If released, this will be the Desert Rose Band&#x27;s only live album.

=== 1990s and beyond ===

At the peak of the Desert Rose Band&#x27;s success, Hillman began appearing infrequently with McGuinn. A duet recorded by the pair for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band&#x27;s &quot;Will The Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II&quot; album, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Going Nowhere&quot;, reached the Country Top 10 in 1989. Soon the pair joined Crosby in a reformed Byrds, playing a handful of club dates. In 1990 they appeared at a tribute to Roy Orbison, performing &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; with the song&#x27;s composer Bob Dylan. That same year the Byrds cut four new songs for inclusion in a career-spanning box set, and in 1991 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1996 Hillman reunited with Desert Rose Band alumnus Herb Pederson for the CD &quot;Bakersfield Bound&quot;. &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; (1998) and three bluegrass-flavored releases on Rounder Records with Pedersen, Larry Rice, and Tony Rice followed. He appeared on the 1999 album &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot; in a duet with Steve Earle on &quot;High Fashion Queen&quot; (which Hillman wrote with Parsons).

After a brief hiatus Hillman and Pedersen returned with &quot;Way Out West&quot; (2002), a 17-track collection of country, roots rock and Americana; this was followed by &quot;The Other Side&quot; (2005). In 2010 he recorded &quot;Live at Edwards Barn&quot; with Herb Pedersen for Rounder Records.

Hillman has continued to write, perform and tour, with dates in 2017 with Herb Pedersen and John Jorgenson. He released his latest album, &quot;Bidin&#x27; My Time&quot; (2017), co-produced with Tom Petty, featuring guests including Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and members of The Heartbreakers. This has been described as &quot;a kind of summing up of Hillman&#x27;s long and varied career, incorporating the folk, bluegrass, country and rock styles he&#x27;s touched on over the years.&quot;

Along with Roger McGuinn, Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives, Hillman toured in the U.S. with the 50th Anniversary of the Sweetheart of the Rodeo, to sold out venues and outstanding reviews.

His memoir, &quot;Time Between: My Life as a Byrd, Burrito Brother and Beyond,&quot; was published by BMG Books in November 2020, with positive reviews in Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, and now in the second printing.

==Personal life==
Chris Hillman identifies as a Christian although his father was Jewish. He married former record executive Connie Pappas in 1979, who influenced him to affiliate with the Greek Orthodox Church. He later stated, &quot;I’m still learning. You know what I do on Sundays? I sing in a choir. I sing in a Greek Orthodox choir, and I’m the only hillbilly tenor in the Orthodox Church.&quot; Hillman and Pappas have two children, Catherine and Nicholas.

<text>The Haines Highway or Haines Cut-Off (and still often called Haines Road) is a highway that connects Haines, Alaska, in the United States, with Haines Junction, Yukon, Canada, passing through the province of British Columbia. It follows the route of the old Dalton Trail from the port of Haines inland for about to Klukshu, Yukon, and then continues to Haines Junction. The highway is about long, of which is in Alaska.

The highway was known as Yukon Highway 4 until 1978, when it was renumbered Highway 3. It has no number in British Columbia, but editions of &quot;The Milepost&quot; up to at least 2004 list it as Hwy 4, a number actually in use on Vancouver Island. The Alaska section is part of Alaska Route 7.

==History==
The route was originally a trail used by Chilkat Tlingit traders, which eventually became the Dalton Trail. It was used by some prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898-1899; other mining kept the lower Dalton Trail active through the years following its establishment. The British Columbia provincial government converted its portion of the trail to a wagon road in 1909 when copper mining began at Copper Butte and Mt. Glave. In 1911, 30 tons of ore were shipped from the mines.

The highway was built by the U.S. Army in 1943 as an alternate route from the Pacific Ocean to the Alaska Highway, in case the White Pass and Yukon Route railway from Skagway should be blocked. The total cost of the construction was US$13 million.

In the first decades after the war, maintenance was spotty at best; the road was plagued with blizzards in winter and mudslides in summer, and for a time in the 1960s and 1970s, all vehicles traveling the highway were monitored on radio. Year-round access was not achieved until 1963.

Complaints over the condition of the road, primarily in Alaska, led to the U.S. Congress-funded Shakwak reconstruction project. This project, covering the Haines Highway and the portion of the Alaska Highway from Haines Junction to the U.S. border, began in 1976 and was mostly complete by the 1980s, but is still continuing, providing grade improvements, rerouting of dangerous sections, and paving. Responsibility for maintenance is currently shared between the Alaska and Yukon governments.

<doc id="956563" wikidata="Q1135245" url="?curid=956563" title="Seigō Nakano">
<text>was a journalist and politician in Imperial Japan, known primarily for involvement in far-right politics through leadership of the &quot;Tōhōkai&quot; (&quot;Far East Society&quot;) party, as well as his opposition to Tōjō Hideki and eventual suicide under murky circumstances.

Born in the city of Fukuoka, Nakano went on to attend Waseda University for four years, writing a number of articles for the journal &quot;Nihon oyobi Nihonjin&quot; (Japan and the Japanese) before graduating in July 1909. In these and in other speeches and articles he would produce, he expressed his political views. Nakano maintained an opposition to Japan&#x27;s establishment throughout his life, criticizing in turn oligarchs such as Katsura Tarō, the &quot;Seiyūkai&quot; cabinet of Baron Tanaka Giichi, and eventually Tōjō Hideki, the last of which ultimately cost him his life. Despite this opposition, however, Nakano would remain committed to working within political parties and the diet, rejecting the violent coups and putsches of young officers. Of great influence on his political thought was the &quot;Ōyōmei&quot; tradition. Embracing an intuitionist, autonomist view of the individual, &quot;Ōyōmei&quot; thought emphasized the following of what one identifies as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;just&quot;, over wealth and obedience to corrupt authorities. In the case of Saigō Takamori, who Nakano held as a hero far greater than himself, &quot;Ōyōmei&quot; sanctified his rebellion against the Meiji Government as heroic.

In his views of the Meiji Restoration, Nakano viewed the event as the result of popular discontent at the Shogunate&#x27;s despotic rule. But though the leaders of the restoration had been united in a heroic effort against despotic government, a split occurred in which men valuing liberty such as Saigō were sidelined and instead, the Meiji oligarchy allowed Western ideas to flood into the country, eroding Japan&#x27;s unique spirit and creating a system of oligarchic-bureaucratic rule which was opposed to popular will.

During the 1st Constitutional Protection Movement, he relentlessly attacked the Katsura cabinet and the &quot;hanbatsu&quot; system of clique government as a writer at the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, earning him both a reputation as a liberal and the displeasure of the paper, leading him to launch the &quot;Tohojironsha&quot; paper in 1916. After election to the diet in 1920, Nakano would join a generation of younger, reformist politicians, eventually aligning with Inukai Tsuyoshi and the &quot;Kakushin Kurabu&quot; (Reform Club) in 1922, but later believed no serious change could be made outside of one of the two major parties and transfer to the &quot;Kenseikai&quot; in 1924. Following the Manchurian Incident, Nakano admired the plotters, contrasting their decisive action with the Tanaka cabinet&#x27;s wavering between hardline policy and capitulation to the United States on China issues. 

To form a strong government to deal with the climate of crisis in the early 1930s, Nakano first attempted to organize a union of the &quot;Seiyukai&quot; and &quot;Minseito&quot;, then organizing the &quot;Kokumin Domei&quot; (Citizens’ Alliance) political party with Adachi Kenzo when he failed. Due to disagreements between the two personalities, however, Nakano split to form the &quot;Tōhōkai&quot; in 1936. Eventually, he would join the &quot;Taisei Yokusankai&quot;, but left in late 1940 in protest over the restraints imposed on it by conservative forces, primarily the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; and party politicians. He would go on to become a vicious opponent of Tōjō Hideki and his cabinet before committing ritual suicide while under government pressure in 1943.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nakano was born as Jintarō Nakano () in the city of Fukuoka, located in Kyushu, the first and eldest son of his family. His father, Taijirō Nakano, was a pawn shop owner from an impoverished samurai family. His mother was Tora Nakano. Nakano would also have two brothers, Taisuke and Hideto, and two sisters, Teru and Mura.

From the ages of 5 to 14, Nakano attended primary school before graduating to attend Fukuoka Prefectural Shūyūkan. In his primary school years, he was described as a bright pupil. At the Shūyūkan, Nakano took an interest in Judo, but suffered a leg injury in his 1st year, forcing him to repeat it and preventing him from joining the military. He also began writing for his school magazine during this time, taking the pen name Masakata, and helped to establish a martial arts centre for pupils called Shimbukan.

In April 1905, Nakano enrolled at Waseda University, a prestigious private university located in Shinjuku, Tokyo, in Political Science. His father&#x27;s business had gone bankrupt at the time, so in order to pay for his studies, he began to write for the journal &quot;Nihon oyobi Nihonjin&quot; (Japan and the Japanese), through which he became acquainted with Miyake Setsurei, the journal’s owner. He also became acquainted with Mitsuru Tōyama, the most influential figure in the &quot;Genyōsha&quot;, a secret ultranationalist society. Though Nakano would never join the &quot;Genyōsha&quot;, he would retain ties to it and Tōyama throughout his life. He would graduate four years after his entry into Waseda in July 1909.

===Career in Journalism===
After Nakano’s graduation, he pursued a career in journalism as a way to eventually enter politics. He worked at the &quot;Nichi Nichi Shimbun&quot; for a short while before transferring to the larger and more famous &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; in 1911. Writing for the &quot;Asahi&quot;, he published his political views on matters, such as in “Politicians in and out of Office”, a writing in which he criticized Katsura Taro, a member of the aristocracy, and Saionji Kinmochi, another member of the aristocracy as well as the leader of the majority &quot;Seiyūkai&quot; party, for their arrangement in which when one resigned the office of Prime Minister, the other would take his place. During the Xinhai Revolution, Nakano expressed his support of the revolutionaries against the criticism of figures such as Yamagata Aritomo and travelled to Shanghai on a business trip, meeting Sun Yat-Sen.

When the Taishō Political Crisis began, Nakano used his position at the &quot;Asahi&quot; to become a scathing critic of Katsura Tarō and cabinet, compiling his letters into a book in 1913. Nakano’s boldness at the paper had earned him many enemies in its management, however, and he was transferred to Korea that year. While there, he criticized Governor Terauchi Masatake for his despotic rule of the colony. Nakano married Tamiko, the daughter of Miyake Setsurei, before he transferred to Korea.

In March 1915, Nakano finished his term in Korea and travelled to the United Kingdom. By this time, the 1st World War had begun. On his trip, he acquired a further distaste for the Western powers and belief in Pan-Asianism. What he saw in Britain he believed to be signs of decadence, and in 1917, he would write an article condemning the hypocrisy of the West, which preached justice and self-determination while perpetuating oppression in their colonies. So disappointed was Nakano that in 1916, he decided return to Japan earlier than planned by way of the United States of America. 

After returning to Japan, he left the &quot;Asahi&quot; and joined the &quot;Tohojironsha&quot; (Eastern Review) newspaper, of which he became Chief Editor. The &quot;Tohojironsha&quot; and &quot;Nihon oyobi Nihonjin&quot; would also later merge due to the destruction of the Kantō Earthquake to form the paper &quot;Gakan&quot; (Our Views) in 1923. Through the &quot;Tohojironsha&quot;, he criticized the Ōkuma cabinet&#x27;s Twenty-One Demands, supported the reunification of China&#x27;s northern and southern governments through Japanese meditation, and supported the rice rioters. He also opposed the Siberian Intervention and urged recognition of the Soviet Russia, believing it would weaken the dominance of the Anglo-American bloc. In 1919, Nakano travelled to report on the peace conference at Versailles. Upon returning to Japan, he blasted the government&#x27;s weakness in confronting the United States, in the process more than tripling the paper&#x27;s circulation from 2000 to 7000.

===Rise in Politics===
In 1917, Nakano campaigned independently to win a diet seat in his hometown of Fukuoka, but failed. In 1920, he campaigned again. Now aided by greater fame from his writings at the &quot;Tohojironsha&quot;, the withdrawal of a rival candidate backed by the Black Dragon Society (which had taken a stance opposite to Nakano on Russia issues), and an expanded electorate, Nakano won a seat at the diet, becoming part of a new, reformist generation of Japanese politicians advocating national reconstruction. Hoping that the postwar discontent would allow new parties to compete with the two dominant parties of the day, the &quot;Seiyukai&quot; and &quot;Kenseikai&quot;, Nakano first joined the &quot;Mushozoku Kurabu&quot; (Independents&#x27; Club) in 1921, and one year later, the &quot;Kakushin Kurabu&quot; (Reform Club), both parties with a significant younger, progressive element, the latter of which dominated by Inukai Tsuyoshi, whom Nakano had fervently supported during the Taisho Political Crisis. Over time, however, Nakano had come to be frustrated with Inukai&#x27;s repeated compromises with the establishment and also began to believe that by remaining in a minor party, he would be unable to affect any real change. In 1924, he joined the &quot;Kenseikai&quot; (Constitutional Politics Association), aligning himself with Adachi Kenzō&#x27;s faction.

In 1927, the &quot;Kenseikai&quot; Wakatsuki cabinet called a truce with their rival, the &quot;Seiyūkai&quot;, officially out of respect for the beginning of the new Emperor&#x27;s reign but in truth over uncertainty over what results the nation&#x27;s first elections under universal suffrage might bring. This move was criticized within the &quot;Kenseikai&quot;, leading to resignations which allowed Nakano to be appointed a Finance Ministry Councillor. After the fall of the Wakatsuki cabinet later that year, however, Nakano would be forced to leave his post, and a new, &quot;Seiyūkai&quot; cabinet was formed by Baron Tanaka Giichi. Nakano would clash several times with Tanaka and his cabinet. Earlier in 1926, he had accused Tanaka of embezzling funds while War Minister in the Siberian Intervention. During Tanaka&#x27;s time as Prime Minister, Nakano would launch a barrage of criticism against the man, attacking him over his heavy-handed foreign policy towards China and Manchuria, as well as showing weakness before the United States.

In 1927, Nakano helped found the &quot;Minseitō&quot; party, the successor to the &quot;Kenseikai&quot;. Representing his increased fortunes within the party, Nakano became a party director, campaign manager, and was also give responsibility for drafting the party program. After the Tanaka cabinet fell following the fallout of Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s assassination, a &quot;Minseitō&quot; cabinet under Hamaguchi Osachi was formed. Nakano was offered the position of Parliamentary Vice Minister of Communications, and while there, he developed a plan to expand the telephone industry through the formation of a company partly government-owned and partly privately-owned, but his plans were blocked by Shidehara Kijūrō, who had become acting Prime Minister after Prime Minister Hamaguchi was severely wounded in an assassination attempt, and Nakano resigned in protest.

Nakano would have further disagreements with the &quot;Minseitō&quot;, particularly over their reimplementation of the gold standard, which he believed was flawed, and when the Manchurian Incident broke out in 1931, Nakano sided with the young officers, praising their spirit and influenced by the &quot;Ōyōmei&quot; tradition, which stressed action and intuition. Despite sharing a dislike of the elitist bureaucracy with the young officers, however, Nakano would always attempt to work within the system.

===Drift Towards Fascism===
====Break with the Minseitō====
By 1932, recent events such as the Great Depression and Manchurian Incident had convinced Nakano that the world and the establishment were drifting towards crisis. In order to form a strong government, he first attempted to create a union of the two largest political parties, the &quot;Seiyukai&quot; and &quot;Minseito&quot;. When this attempt failed, however, Nakano formed the &quot;Kokumin Dōmei&quot; (National Alliance) with Adachi Kenzō and his faction, breaking away from the &quot;Minseito&quot;, then elaborating and going further on his earlier proposals for national reconstruction. In the pamphlet &quot;Tenkan Nihon no Dōkō&quot; (Trends of Japan in Transition), he now claimed that the general trend of the times was towards one-party states, and that parliamentary politics and laissez-faire economics, both based on the British model, were outdated. In a later 1933 publication, &quot;Kokka Kaizō Keikaku Kōryō&quot; (Outline Plan for National Reconstruction), Nakano would advocate for a corporatist system. Upon the formation of the &quot;Kokumin Dōmei&quot;, the party platform called for the establishment of a &quot;controlled economy&quot;, &quot;aiming at the guarantee of the masses&#x27; livelihood&quot;. In his campaign for a reconstruction of Japan, Nakano would also forge ties with military men such as Kanji Ishiwara and advocate heavily for the recognition of Manchukuo.

Nakano&#x27;s time in the &quot;Kokumin Dōmei&quot; would be limited, however. As 1932 passed, so did the sense of impending crisis which had convinced him to break away from the hopefully soon-to-be irrelevant establishment parties, and tensions which Adachi increased. Of particular frustration to Nakano was Adachi&#x27;s refusal to wear the blackshirt, the party uniform, because he thought it looked silly, and his support of the Okada cabinet. In May 1936, Nakano broke off to form the &quot;Tōhōkai&quot; (&quot;Far East Society&quot;), his final attempt at forging a mass-based party. Tragedy also struck Nakano&#x27;s family in the early 30s. His wife perished of tuberculosis in 1934, his son died in a skiing accident in 1931, and his second eldest son died of blood poisoning in 1935. On the national scale, the fading sense of crisis came to convince Nakano that a national reconstruction of Japan could be spurred on through international action, as with the Manchurian Incident.

====Meeting with Hitler and Time in the IRAA====
During the February 26th Incident, Nakano excitedly took his sons to see the rebels from afar, believing the incident could spark a renovation, but as the revolt was crushed, so were Nakano&#x27;s hopes. With the start of the China War, however, he believed the conflict would be the chance needed to restructure Japan. Nakano enthusiastically supported the war, claiming that Chiang Kai-Shek was a puppet of the West. In December 1937, he had a personal audience with Benito Mussolini. In the next month, Nakano met with Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop, where he told the German dictator that China&#x27;s Nationalist Government was on its deathbed. He also urged close cooperation with the Axis powers against the Anglo-American bloc.

By this point, Nakano&#x27;s pro-Nazi and pro-military rhetoric was beginning to earn him enemies in the diet. In 1939, Nakano would attempt to expand the &quot;Tōhōkai&quot; through a merger with the socialist &quot;Shakai Taishūtō&quot;. In recent years, the latter party had increasingly come to support the military and bureaucracy against the zaibatsus, making common cause through shared opposition to capitalism and supporting the China War. In the end, however, the merger would fail due to disagreements over the distribution of power and the two parties would simply agree to maintain friendly relations. On a visit to China that same year, the &quot;Seiyukai&quot; and &quot;Minseito&quot; attacked Nakano in the diet, eroding his support and forcing him to resign, though he would later be re-elected in 1942.

In January 1939, Nakano gave a speech on the need for a totalitarian Japan. He argued against those who &quot;say that neither fascism nor Nazism are appropriate for our nation.&quot; He then distinguished between old-style conservative despotism, and a &quot;Totalitarianism... based on essentials.&quot; Arguing against majority rule (as the majority &quot;is the precise cause of contemporary decadence&quot;) and &quot;an individualism which shows no concern for others&quot;, he calls for a &quot;government going beyond democracy&quot; giving consideration to &quot;the essence of human beings.&quot; With organic unification of individuals &quot;sharing common ideals and a common way of feeling,&quot; there can be formed &quot;a perfect national organization.&quot;

In his struggle against the growing monopoly of power by high civil and military officials and privileged capital, he even adapted the theme of anti-semitism to the Japanese scene. Recalling Hitler&#x27;s claim that Germany&#x27;s defeat in the Great War had been due to Jewish domination of finance and administration in collusion with the German and Austrian bureaucracy, he drew an analogy with the control of the wartime Japanese economy by bureaucrats and their capitalist collaborators in state-backed economic agencies, coining the concept of &quot;yudaya-shugi&quot; (Jewish mentality) to describe them.

In 1940, Nakano joined the New Structure Preparatory Committee, an organization formed by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe as a think tank to prepare the creation of a body which could help organize a new order in Japan. Later that year, the &quot;Taisei Yokusankai&quot; (Imperial Rule Assistance Association) would be formed as the result of that body and Nakano would be appointed as an Executive Director. His increased fortunes in this time were aided by the fall of Yonai cabinet and Japan&#x27;s signing of the Tripartite Pact, vindicating his pro-Nazi views. He would end up resigning his IRAA position in December, however, after Konoe capitulated to pressure from zaibatsu and diet members in bringing traditionalists into the cabinet and weakening the organization&#x27;s political role.

===Opposition to Tōjō===

After the formation of the Tōjō cabinet, the government continued to steadily increase measures aimed at transforming Japan into a totalitarian society. After the 1942 elections, in which Nakano regained his diet seat, the government formed the &quot;Yokusan Seijikai&quot; (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association) to act as Japan&#x27;s sole political organization, as the &quot;Taisei Yokusankai&quot; had earlier been declared not be a political organization. This necessitated the dissolution of the reformed &quot;Tōhōkai&quot;, which reconstituted as the &quot;Tōhō Jikai&quot;, an apolitical cultural organization. The results of the 1942 election also proved a disappointment to Nakano, as he had fielded a total of 46 candidates and expected to have 20 elected, but only 7, including himself, were successful. He joined the &quot;Yokusan Seijikai&quot; after its formation.

Eventually, Nakano became a harsh critic of both Tōjō and the IRAA. He claimed that the party was becoming a tool of the bureaucracy to establish a dictatorship over the people and that it was unrepresentative of popular will. He also labelled Tōjō as a despot. Among the reasons for Nakano&#x27;s anger at Tōjō were the harsh regime of economic controls led by the bureaucracy and Japan&#x27;s decreasing fortunes in the Pacific War.

Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Nakano had been a strong advocate of expansion into the colonial territories of Southeast Asia, which, as their European masters were either occupied by the Germans in the cases of France and the Netherlands or held down by the conflict with Germany, in the case of Britain, they would be easily occupied and liberated by Japan. The bringing in of the United States into the conflict, however, worried Nakano.

At Waseda University, Nakano gave a speech entitled &quot;The World Prospers through the Individual&quot; &quot;(Tenka Ichinin o Motte Okoru)&quot;. In it, he criticized Kishi Nobusuke and the bureaucracy, going over Japan&#x27;s recent history. He also praised Itagaki Taisuke, a well known Japanese liberal, as well as Japanese liberalism in a broad sense, contrasting it with Anglo-American liberalism. Such criticism brought only greater government pressure upon him. Nakano was forbidden to publish articles or make public speeches. In June 1943, Nakano resigned from the &quot;Yokusan Seijikai&quot; over the expulsion of a diet member.

In the final months of his life, Nakano attempted to aid in overthrowing the Tōjō cabinet. He reached out to men such as Konoe Fumimaro, Tanabe Tadao, who was an officer on the Planning Board, Matsumae Shigeyoshi, Hatoyama Ichirō, and Prince Higashikuni. Ultimately, Nakano planned to convince the senior statesmen to remove Tōjō and have him replaced by General Ugaki Kazushige. Tōjō loyalists would then be purged from the Army and government while the economy would be rationalized to turn the tide of the war and force the United States into peace talks.

Hoping to have Nakano removed from the diet when the Tōjō cabinet presented a plan for greater economic controls, on October 21, Nakano and 100 others were arrested by the police. While in confinement, Nakano confessed to spreading harmful rumors about the government. As this confession was not enough to legally confine him and prevent from attending the October 26th Diet session however, Nakano was made to sign an agreement not to attend the diet the next day and released on the 25th. However, he was then taken to &quot;Kempeitai&quot; headquarters shortly before once again being sent home. 

On October 27, Nakano Seigō committed suicide. The circumstances surrounding his death have been a source of debate since the incident happened. It is speculated that at the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; headquarters, the officers there coerced him into taking his own life by threatening his family. Before Nakano committed suicide, the portraits of Hitler and Mussolini in his room were replaced with a statue of Kusunoki Masashige, a samurai known for his intense loyalty, and a biography of Saigō Takamori, a figure he had admired for all of his life. 20,000 people attended his funeral.

<text>Earl of Pomfret (alias Pontefract) was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain created in 1721 for Thomas Fermor, 2nd Baron Leominster. The title became extinct upon the death of the fifth earl in 1867.

==Ancestral titles and achievements==
The Fermor family descended from Richard Fermor (d. 1552), who acquired great wealth as a wool merchant. However, he fell out with Henry VIII after remaining an adherent of Catholicism and had his estates confiscated. Some of the estates, including Easton Neston in South Northamptonshire, were restored after the accession of Edward VI.

In 1603, his grandson Sir George Fermor entertained James I and Anne of Denmark at Easton Neston. In 1615, he was confirmed by the Crown following his marriage as lord of the manor of Westoning, Bedfordshire.

Sir George&#x27;s grandson William Fermor was created a Baronet, of Easton Neston in the County of Northampton, in the Baronetage of England in 1641, aged nineteen and succeeded by his son. The latter was raised in 1692 to the Peerage of England as Baron Leominster, in the County of Hereford. His eldest son was elevated to become Earl of Pomfret in 1721. The latter was succeeded by his son, who became a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George III and sold the manor of Westoning in 1767 to John Everitt. Two sons, the third and fourth Earls, succeeded. The titles became extinct upon the death of the fourth Earl&#x27;s son in 1867.

The seat of the Fermor family was Easton Neston in Northamptonshire. The house came into the Hesketh family (who were later created Barons Hesketh) through the marriage in 1846 of Sir Thomas George Hesketh, 5th Baronet, of Rufford, to Lady Anna Maria Arabella Fermor, sister and heiress of the 5th Earl of Pomfret. The main blocks and much of the gothick village of Hulcote were sold by the 3rd Baron Hesketh in 2005 to Leon Max.

==Fermor Baronets, of Easton Neston (1641)==

*Sir William Fermor, 1st Baronet (1619–1661)
*Sir William Fermor, 2nd Baronet (1648–1711) (created Baron Leominster in 1692)

==Barons Leominster (1692)==
*William Fermor, 1st Baron Leominster (1648–1711)
*Thomas Fermor, 2nd Baron Leominster (1698–1753) (created Earl of Pomfret in 1721)

==Earls of Pomfret (1721)==
*Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret (1698–1753)
*George Fermor, 2nd Earl of Pomfret (1722–1785)

<doc id="956575" wikidata="Q650765" url="?curid=956575" title="Mary Rose Oakar">
<text>Mary Rose Oakar (born March 5, 1940) is an American Democratic politician and former member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio, serving from 1977 to 1993. Oakar was the first Arab American woman, first Syrian American, and first Lebanese American woman to serve in Congress. She was also the first Democratic woman elected to the United States Congress from that state. Oakar later served as a member of the Ohio State Board of Education.

==Early life==
Oakar, who graduated with a B.A. from Ursuline College in 1962 and an M.A. from John Carroll University in 1966, taught at Lourdes Academy, a Catholic high school for women, directed plays, taught at Cuyahoga Community College from 1968 to 1975 and served on the Cleveland City Council from 1973 to 1976 before winning election to the House from Ohio&#x27;s 20th congressional district in Cleveland&#x27;s West Side and the surrounding suburbs. She took office in 1977, succeeding James V. Stanton.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Oakar, one of very few Arab-American members of the House (she is of Lebanese and Syrian ancestry), became regarded as an increasingly powerful member. She was a high-ranking member of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and the House Administration Committee. Oakar&#x27;s high placement on these committees allowed her to bring home to Cleveland large sums of money for urban renewal. Oakar forged strong relationships with Jewish groups in Cleveland. From 1985 to 1989, she was elected to a position in the House Democratic leadership, as Secretary of the House Democratic Caucus.

=== House bank scandal ===
In 1991, she was one of nearly 100 Members of Congress involved in the widespread House banking scandal involving multiple overdrafts and bounced checks. The House Bank, not a normally operating financial institution, was used to pay members of the House. However, members were allowed to take advances on their pay checks without overdraft charges or repercussions to their credit. Oakar was indicted on seven counts, including lying to the FBI, filing false financial statements and using the House bank to convert public money for personal use. If sentenced, she could have received 40 years in prison and a $1.7 million fine.

=== Campaign irregularities ===
She had used the names of straw donors on federal documents to conceal illegal contributions amounting to $16,000. Three counts against her were thrown out by the Supreme Court, the others were dropped after she entered a plea bargain in which she pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges; conspiracy and violation of election law.

=== Redistricting and defeat ===
In 1992, her district was renumbered the 10th and redrawn to include more Republicans, though it was still solidly Democratic. Oakar withstood a challenge from Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim Hagan in the Democratic primary — Hagan had been endorsed by Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White — but lost to businessman Martin Hoke in the general election.

==Post-Congress career==
She won a 1999 libel settlement against Cleveland&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; after seven years in court. In April 1992 the Plain Dealer published articles alleging that Oakar was forced to resign from a congressional task force after the House banking scandal. The paper acknowledged that the eight-term Democrat &quot;was rightfully upset that erroneous information&quot; had been printed.

Oakar unsuccessfully ran in the 2001 Cleveland Mayoral Primary and served a single term in the Ohio House of Representatives from 2000 to 2002.

Oakar served as president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) from 2003 through 2010. ADC describes itself as the largest Arab-American grassroots civil-rights organization in the U.S.

In November 2012, she was elected to a four-year term on the Ohio State Board of Education where she represents District 11 which encompasses Ohio Senate districts 21, 23 and 25.

==In popular culture==
In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Oakar&#x27;s name and picture.

<doc id="956586" wikidata="Q7867194" url="?curid=956586" title="USS Alfred">
<text>Alfred was the merchant vessel Black Prince, named for Prince Edward, Duke of Cornwall and launched in 1774. The Continental Navy acquired her in 1775, renaming her &quot;Alfred&quot; after 9th century English monarch Alfred of Wessex, and commissioned her as a 24-gun frigate. During the American Revolutionary War, the &quot;Alfred&quot; participated in two major naval operations; the battles of Nassau and Block Island. The Royal Navy captured her in 1778, took her into service as HMS &quot;Alfred&quot;, and sold her in 1782. She then became the merchantman &quot;Alfred&quot;, and sailed between London and Jamaica.

==&quot;Black Prince&quot;==
&quot;Black Prince&quot; was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774. No record of her builder seems to have survived, but it is possible that John Wharton may have constructed the ship. She was owned by Willing, Morris &amp; Co., a merchant trading firm operated by Thomas Willing and Robert Morris. John Barry served as the ship&#x27;s only master during her career as a Philadelphia merchantman. Launched in the autumn of 1774 as relations between the colonies and the mother country grew increasingly tense, the &quot;Black Prince&quot; was fitted out quickly so that she could load and sail to Bristol on the last day of 1774. It did not return until April 25, 1775, six days after the Battle of Lexington.

Fearing that American commerce would soon be interrupted, her owners were eager to export another cargo to England, so they again raced to load and provision her. &quot;Black Prince&quot; sailed on May 7, this time bound for London. She did not reach that destination until June 27. The ship left the Thames on August 10 but encountered contrary winds during much of her westward voyage and finally returned to Philadelphia on October 4. While the ship had been abroad, the Battle of Bunker Hill had been fought, the other colonies acting in Congress had pledged to support Massachusetts in its struggle for freedom, and George Washington had taken command of the American Army besieging British-occupied Boston. Moreover, private correspondence, between shipowner Morris, and his trading partner, Richard Champion of Bristol, was brought from England on &quot;Black Prince&quot; to members of the Continental Congress. It reported that the British Government was sending to America two unarmed brigs heavily laden with gunpowder and arms.

This intelligence prompted Congress on October 13 to authorize the fitting out of two American warships, one of 10 guns and the other of an unspecified size, to attempt to capture these ships and divert their invaluable cargoes to the ill-equipped soldiers of Washington&#x27;s army. Congress decided, on October 30, to specify the second vessel as being 14 guns and to add two more ships to the navy, one of 20 guns and the other slightly larger but not to exceed 36 guns. One of the ship&#x27;s owners, Morris, was a member of the Marine Committee when that committee acquired the &quot;Alfred&quot;. A second ship, also owned by Willing Morris &amp; Co. became the &quot;Columbus&quot; at the same time.

==USS &quot;Alfred&quot;==
The Naval Committee of the Continental Congress purchased &quot;Black Prince&quot; on November 4, 1775, renaming her &quot;Alfred&quot; after 9th century English monarch Alfred of Wessex, four days later, and ordered her fitted out as a man-of-war. Her former master, John Barry, was placed in charge of her rerigging; Joshua Humphreys was selected to superintend changes strengthening her hull, timbers, and bulwarks as well as opening gunports; and Nathaniel Falconer was made responsible for her ordnance and provisions. Soon four other vessels joined her in the Continental Navy: , , , and sloop . Esek Hopkins, a veteran master of merchantmen from Rhode Island, was appointed commodore of the flotilla. &quot;Alfred&quot; was acquired on December 3, 1775, Capt. Dudley Saltonstall in command, and became Hopkins&#x27; flagship. On the same day &quot;Alfred&quot; became the first vessel to fly the &quot;Flag of America&quot; (precursor to the U.S. flag). The ensign was hoisted on the Delaware by Lieutenant John Paul Jones and documented in letters to Congress.

The new fleet dropped down the Delaware on January 4, 1776; but a cold snap froze the river and the bay, checking its progress at Reedy Island for some six weeks. A thaw released Hopkins&#x27; warships from winter&#x27;s icy grasp in mid-February, and the fleet sortied on 18 February for its first operation. The Marine Committee had ordered Hopkins to sail for Hampton Roads to attack British warships which were harassing American shipping in Virginia waters; then to render similar service at Charleston, South Carolina; and, finally, to head for Rhode Island waters. He was given the discretion of disregarding these orders if they proved impossible and planning an operation of his own. However, by the time his ships broke free of the ice, growing British strength in the Chesapeake prompted Hopkins to head for the West Indies. Knowing that the American colonies desperately needed gunpowder, he decided to attack the island of New Providence in the Bahamas to capture a large supply of that commodity as well as other military supplies reportedly stored there in great quantity.

A fortnight after leaving the Delaware capes, on the morning of March 3 Hopkins arrived off Nassau and captured Fort Montague in a bloodless Battle of Nassau, in which Continental Marines under Capt. Samuel Nicholas joined Hopkins&#x27; sailors in America&#x27;s first amphibious operation. That evening, Hopkins issued a proclamation which promised not to harm &quot;... the persons or property of the inhabitants of New Providence ...&quot; if they did not resist. The following morning, Governor Montfort Browne surrendered Fort Nassau but only after he had spirited away most of the island&#x27;s gunpowder from New Providence to St. Augustine, Florida.

After Hopkins stripped the forts of their guns and all remaining ordnance, &quot;Alfred&quot; led the American fleet homeward from Nassau harbor on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, March 17, the same day that British troops were evacuating Boston. On April 4, during the homeward voyage, Hopkins&#x27; ships captured the six-gun British schooner &quot;Hawk&quot; and the eight-gun brig . Shortly after midnight on April 6, Hopkins encountered the 20-gun &quot;Glasgow&quot;. That British frigate—which was carrying dispatches telling of the British withdrawal—put up a fierce and skillful fight which enabled her to escape from her substantially more powerful American opponents. At the outset of the fray, fire from her cannon cut &quot;Alfred&quot;&#x27;s tiller ropes, leaving Hopkins&#x27; flagship unable to maneuver or to pursue effectively. The American ships did attempt to chase their fleeing enemy, but after dawn &quot;Glasgow&quot; disappeared over the horizon and safely reached Newport, Rhode Island. When &quot;Alfred&quot; and her consorts put into New London, Connecticut on April 8, the Americans were at first welcomed as heroes. still, many of the officers of the American squadron voiced dissatisfaction with Hopkins, and he was later relieved of command.

&quot;Alfred&quot; was inactive through the summer for a number of reasons, but high on the list of her problems were want of funds and a shortage of men. On August 7, Capt. John Paul Jones, who had helped to fit her out as a warship and had been her first lieutenant on the cruise to New Providence, was placed in command of the ship. She departed Providence, Rhode Island, on October 26, 1776, in company with &quot;Hampden&quot;, but that vessel struck a &quot;sunken rock&quot; before they could leave Narragansett Bay and returned to Newport. Her officers and men then shifted to sloop &quot;Providence&quot; accompanying &quot;Alfred&quot; to waters off Cape Breton Island which they reached by mid-November. There they took three prizes: on the 11th, the brigantine &quot;Active&quot;, bound from Liverpool to Halifax with an assorted cargo, the next day, the armed transport &quot;Mellish&quot;, laden with winter uniforms for British troops at Quebec; and, on the 16th, the scow &quot;Kitty&quot;, bound from Gaspé to Barbados with oil and fish.

Because of severe leaks, &quot;Providence&quot; sailed for home soon thereafter and &quot;Alfred&quot; continued her cruise alone. On November 22 boats from &quot;Alfred&quot; raided Canso, Nova Scotia, where their crews burned a transport bound for Canada with provisions, and a warehouse full of whale oil, besides capturing a small schooner to replace &quot;Providence&quot;. Two days later, &quot;Alfred&quot; captured three colliers off Louisburg, bound from Nova Scotia to New York with coal for the British Army and, on November 26 captured the 10-gun letter-of-marque &quot;John&quot; of Liverpool. On the homeward voyage, &quot;Alfred&quot; was pursued by HMS &quot;Milford&quot; but managed to escape after a four-hour chase. She arrived safely at Boston on December 15 and began a major refit.

Captain Elisha Hinman became &quot;Alfred&#x27;s&quot; commanding officer in May 1777. She did not get underway until August 22 when she sailed for France with USS to obtain military supplies. En route, they captured four small prizes, including brig &quot;Sally&quot; on September 28. They reached L&#x27;Orient on October 6, and on December 29 sailed for America. They proceeded via the coast of Africa, where they took a small sloop, and then headed for the West Indies, hoping to add to their score before turning northward for home. On March 9, 1778, near Barbados, they encountered British warships and . When the American ships attempted to flee, &quot;Alfred&quot; fell behind her faster consort. Shortly after noon the British men-of-war caught up with &quot;Alfred&quot; and forced her to surrender after a half an hour&#x27;s battle.

==HMS &quot;Alfred&quot;==
Her captors took &quot;Alfred&quot; to Barbados where she was condemned and sold. The Royal Navy purchased her and took her into service as HMS &quot;Alfred&quot;, a sloop of 20 guns. The Admiralty sold her in 1782.

==&quot;Alfred&quot;==
&quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Register&quot; for 1789 shows an &quot;Alfred&quot;, of 400 tons (bm), built in Philadelphia, with master &quot;Delamore&quot; and owner T. Seale. Her trade is listed as London – Jamaica. Unfortunately there are no readily available interim or later issues of &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Register&quot; so her history as a merchant vessel is unclear.

<doc id="956589" wikidata="Q2991022" url="?curid=956589" title="Earl of Godolphin">
<text>Earl of Godolphin was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1706 for Sidney Godolphin, 1st Baron Godolphin, the Lord High Treasurer. At the same time, he was created Viscount Rialton. In 1684 he had already been created Baron Godolphin, of Rialton, also in the Peerage of England. He was a leading politician of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, a Knight of the Garter and Governor of Scilly. Upon his death in 1712, his titles passed to his only child, Francis.

This 2nd Earl of Godolphin married Henrietta, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough. Their only son, William Godolphin, Marquess of Blandford, was childless and predeceased both his parents. In 1735 the 2nd Earl was created Baron Godolphin, of Helston, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to the male issue of his deceased uncle Henry Godolphin, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. When the 2nd Earl died in 1766, the Godolphin earldom, the Rialton viscounty, and the Godolphin barony of 1684 became extinct; but the Godolphin barony of 1735 devolved upon his cousin Francis Godolphin, 2nd Baron Godolphin.

The ancestral seat of the Godolphin family was Godolphin House near Helston in Cornwall. The family took a close interest in mining and a number of mines were founded on their land. At Wheal Vor they experimented with several new inventions (for instance, the Newcomen engine in 1715) to improve the working of their mines.

<doc id="956594" wikidata="Q5326046" url="?curid=956594" title="Earl Poulett">
<text>Earl Poulett &quot;(pronounced &quot;Paulett&quot;)&quot; was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1706 for John Poulett, 4th Baron Poulett. The Poulett family descended from Sir Anthony Paulet, son of Sir Amias Paulet, who served as Governor of Jersey and as Captain of the Guard to Queen Elizabeth I. The ancestral family seat was Hinton House in the village of Hinton St George, Somerset.

His eldest son Sir John Poulett represented Somerset and Lyme Regis in the House of Commons. In 1627 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Poulett, of Hinton St George in the County of Somerset. Lord Poulett later supported the Royalist cause in the Civil War.

The first Baron&#x27;s son, John Poulett (1615–1665) was a Member of Parliament for Stamford and fought as a Royalist Officer in the Civil War. On his father&#x27;s death in 1649 he succeeded as second baron.

His son, the third Baron, represented Somerset in Parliament and also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset.
He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron, a commissioner for the Treaty of Union with the Kingdom of Scotland. In 1706 he was created Viscount Hinton St George and Earl Poulett in the Peerage of England. Lord Poulett later served as First Lord of the Treasury and as Lord Steward of the Household.

When he died, the titles passed to his eldest son, the second Earl. He had already been summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Poulett in his father&#x27;s lifetime and also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Somerset. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl, who had previously sat as a Member of Parliament for Bridgwater and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Devon.

The third Earl&#x27;s son, the fourth Earl, was Lord-Lieutenant of Somerset. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Earl.

On the death of the 5th Earl, whose sons had all pre-deceased him, the titles passed to his nephew, the sixth Earl. He was the third son of Vice-Admiral the Hon. George Poulett, second son of the fourth Earl. The sixth earl was heavily involved in steeplechasing as a racehorse owner whose cerise and blue colours were most famed for being carried to victory twice in the Grand National, in 1868 and 1871, by a horse called The Lamb.

On the death of the 6th Earl, a dispute arose (see below), and the outcome was that the earldom and other titles were awarded to the 6th Earl&#x27;s son by his third wife, who became the seventh Earl Poulett. He fought in the First World War as a captain in the Royal Horse Artillery and died of influenza in 1918. He was succeeded by his only son, the eighth Earl, who was brought up by his mother, a former actress, and after Eton trained as a railway engineer. Although three times married, he was childless, and on his death in 1973 all his titles became extinct. Since both the 8th Earl and his sister Lady Bridget Poulett were childless, in 1968 the 8th and last Earl Poulett sold the Hinton estate, after which he and his wife settled in Jersey, Channel Islands. Perhaps he recalled that three of his Poulett ancestors had been Governor of Jersey in the 16th century.

Lady Bridget Poulett (1912–1978), the only sibling of the 8th and last Earl, was a &#x27;Society Beauty&#x27; of the 1930s.

==Disputed descent of earldom==
On the sixth Earl&#x27;s death in 1899, a dispute arose over the succession to his titles.

A son, William Turnour Thomas Poulett, had been born to the 6th Earl&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth Lavinia, in 1849, while they were married, but although his wife insisted he was the child&#x27;s father, Captain Poulett (as he then was) had reason to believe the child had been fathered by another man, Captain William Turnour Granville, after whom his mother named him. Until a son was born in 1883, he had no son he believed to be his own, yet treated W. T. T. Poulett as his son. Thus in 1875, W. T. T. Poulett was living at the family&#x27;s secondary estate, Grenville Hall, Droxford, under the courtesy title of Viscount Hinton. However, after the birth of William John Lydston Poulett he was disowned.

Following the 6th Earl&#x27;s death, the Poulett earldom and its entailed estates were claimed by W. T. T. Poulett, but this was challenged on the grounds of paternity, and on 27 July 1903, on a report from its Committee of Privileges steered by the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, the House determined the dispute in favour of the 6th Earl&#x27;s fifteen-year-old son, William John Lydston Poulett. The House of Lords rejected the doctrine of &quot;pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant&quot; – a child born within wedlock is lawfully fathered by its mother&#x27;s husband.

The facts and outcome heavily contrast with the allegedly summons-entitled Earls of Banbury (before the House of Lords Act 1999) where the paternity evidence was no mention of the title-inheriting sons in a will, so that family no longer received any summons to the House.

In 1869, while he was known as Viscount Hinton, W. T. T. Poulett married Lydia Ann Shippy (aka Anne Sheppey) and had had one son, William Henry George Poulett (born 1 April 1870). In a fortunate turn of events, in 1901 Wilhelmina Powlett, Duchess of Cleveland, the widow of a distant kinsman of the 6th Earl&#x27;s, left W. H. G. Poulett a bequest of £5,000 in her Will, and he became a tea-planter in Ceylon.

<text>Girl Crazy is a 1930 musical by George Gershwin with lyrics by Ira Gershwin and book by Guy Bolton and John McGowan. Ethel Merman made her stage debut in the first production and co-lead Ginger Rogers became an overnight star. Rich in song, it follows the story of Danny Churchill who has been sent to fictional Custerville, Arizona, to manage his family&#x27;s ranch. His father wants him there to focus on matters more serious than alcohol and women but Danny turns the place into a dude ranch, importing showgirls from Broadway and hiring Kate Forthergill (Merman&#x27;s role) as entertainer. Visitors come from both coasts and Danny falls in love with the local postmistress, Molly Gray (Rogers&#x27; role).

Three subsequent film adaptations adjusted the plot. The most notable, in 1943, starred Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, with the latter playing a combined Kate and Molly.

==Productions==
The musical opened at the Alvin Theatre on October 14, 1930, and closed on June 6, 1931, after 272 performances. It was directed by Alexander Leftwich, with choreography by George Hale and sets by Donald Oenslager. This musical made a star of Ginger Rogers, who, with Allen Kearns, sang &quot;Could You Use Me?&quot; and &quot;Embraceable You&quot; and, with Willie Howard, &quot;But Not for Me&quot;. Ethel Merman, in her Broadway debut sang &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Sam and Delilah&quot;, and &quot;Boy! What Love Has Done To Me!&quot; and &quot;became an overnight sensation...that launched her fifty year career.&quot; Also of note is the opening night pit orchestra, which was composed of many well-known jazz musicians, including Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller and Jimmy Dorsey.

&quot;The score was one of the Gershwins&#x27; best&quot; according to theatre writer Ken Bloom.

A version with a heavily revised book was presented in 1975 by the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre and in 1979 by the Coachlight Dinner Theater (East Windsor, CT).

In 1992 the show appeared on Broadway in a heavily revised version. It was given a new title, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, and a completely new plot, and interpolated with material from other Gershwin stage shows and films, specifically songs written for the Fred Astaire movies of the 1930s such as &quot;Nice Work If You Can Get It&quot; from A Damsel in Distress and &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away From Me&quot; from Shall We Dance.

&quot;Musicals Tonight!&quot;, New York City, presented a staged concert in September 2001.

An abridged version of &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; was presented at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC October 2–5, 2008 as part of their &quot;&quot; production. Max von Essen played Danny, Jenn Colella played Molly, and Randy Graff played Kate, directed by Lonny Price.

The New York City Center Encores! staged concert was held in November 2009. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it starred Ana Gasteyer, Marc Kudisch, Becki Newton, and Wayne Knight.

The two-time Olympic champion and Emmy-winning television commentator Dick Button starred as Danny in a 1958 production, which also co-starred Jane Connell as Kate and Gordon Connell as Pete; it interpolated Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;They All Laughed&quot; and &quot;Nice Work If You can Get It&quot; into the score.

The pit orchestra included &quot;Red&quot; Nichols, Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman and Jack Teagarden. Roger Edens was the onstage pianist for Ethel Merman. It was conducted on opening night by George Gershwin himself. The 1953 biopic &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; recreated the &quot;I&#x27;m Biding My Time&quot; scene, with Miller (Stewart) playing trombone in the orchestra.

==Reception==
It was said by one critic to be &quot;fresh, ingenious...a rich delight&quot;.

==Film adaptations==

The 1932 RKO Radio Pictures production was very unlike the stage play except for its score. The film was tailored for the comic talents of Wheeler &amp; Woolsey, a then-popular comedy team. In 1943, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced a lavish version starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. In 1965, MGM once again made the musical into a film, for Connie Francis. Unlike the previous two versions, the title was changed to &quot;When the Boys Meet the Girls&quot;. It co-starred Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, Louis Armstrong, and Liberace. A number of Gershwin songs were retained, including &quot;Embraceable You&quot;, &quot;Bidin&#x27; My Time&quot;, &quot;But Not for Me&quot;, &quot;Treat Me Rough&quot;, and &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;.

==Recordings==
No original cast recording was ever made, as original cast recordings did not exist in the U.S. prior to 1943. Several studio recordings of the score have been released, including an early 1950s version with Mary Martin, but the only one using the full score and original 1930 orchestrations was released by Nonesuch Records (Nonesuch 9 79250–2) in 1990 with Lorna Luft (Kate), Frank Gorshin (Gieber Goldfarb), David Carroll (Danny), and Judy Blazer (Molly).

<doc id="956598" wikidata="Q786019" url="?curid=956598" title="The Haunting (1999 film)">
<text>The Haunting is a 1999 American supernatural horror film directed by Jan de Bont, and starring Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, and Lili Taylor, with Marian Seldes, Bruce Dern, Todd Field, and Virginia Madsen appearing in supporting roles. Its plot follows a group of people who gather at a sprawling estate in western Massachusetts for an apparent volunteer study on insomnia, only to find themselves plagued by paranormal events connected to the home&#x27;s grim history. Based on the 1959 novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; by Shirley Jackson, it is the second feature film adaptation of the source material after Robert Wise&#x27;s 1963 film adaptation of the same name.

Development for &quot;The Haunting&quot; originally began as a collaboration between filmmaker Steven Spielberg and writer Stephen King, who together began writing a new adaptation of Jackson&#x27;s novel, largely inspired by Wise&#x27;s 1963 film version. After creative differences, the project was aborted, with King retooling his screenplay to form the 2002 miniseries &quot;Rose Red&quot;. Spielberg meanwhile commissioned a new screenplay for the project, written by David Self, to be produced under Spielberg&#x27;s studio, DreamWorks Pictures. Filming of &quot;The Haunting&quot; began in the fall of 1998, with some location shoots occurring in England at Harlaxton Manor and Belvoir Castle, though the majority of the film was shot in specially crafted sets in Los Angeles by Argentine production designer Eugenio Zanetti.

&quot;The Haunting&quot; premiered theatrically in North America in July 1999. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics but was a financial success, grossing $180.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $80 million.

==Plot==
Eleanor &quot;Nell&quot; Vance, an insomniac, has cared for her disabled mother for 11 years, sharing a Boston apartment with her. After her mother dies, Nell&#x27;s sister Jane and her husband Lou inherit the residence and eject Nell to prepare for a sale. As she faces homelessness, Nell accepts an invitation to participate in an insomnia study by Dr. David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded manor house in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts. At the house, she meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, the eccentric caretakers. Two other participants arrive: goofy Luke Sanderson and glamorous Theodora (&quot;Theo&quot;), along with Dr. Marrow and his two research assistants. Unbeknownst to the participants, Dr. Marrow&#x27;s true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear, intending to expose his subjects to terror.

During their first night, Dr. Marrow relates the story of Hill House: Its original owner, Hugh Crain, a 19th-century textile tycoon, constructed the rambling home for his wife Renee, hoping to populate it with a large family. Unfortunately, all of Crain&#x27;s children were stillborns, and Renee, devastated by the multiple losses, killed herself, while Crain became a recluse. Marrow&#x27;s assistant is wounded in a freak accident and the research assistants leave for the hospital. Supernatural events begin happening, and Nell sees ghosts of children. A large portrait of Hugh Crain is vandalized with the words &quot;Welcome Home Eleanor&quot; written in blood. Theo and Luke accuse Nell, claiming she is seeking attention.

Nell becomes determined to prove that the house is haunted. She finds Crain&#x27;s hidden study and learns that he extensively used child labor in his cotton mills. He tortured and killed orphans in his home, then burned their bodies in the fireplace. She surmises that these children&#x27;s spirits are trapped in the house, providing Crain with an &quot;eternal family&quot;. Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, from whom Nell is descended. Dr. Marrow is skeptical and reveals the truth of his fear study to the group, but after a statue tries to drown him, he realizes Hill House is haunted. Nell reveals that she is related to Carolyn Crain and must help the children move on to the afterlife.

The group tries to leave Hill House but Hugh Crain&#x27;s ghost traps them inside. Luke defaces a portrait of Crain, enraging his spirit to decapitate Luke. When Crain manifests, Nell realizes that he thrived on the fear he created in children and declares that she is not afraid of him. Her declaration weakens the ghost and he is cast into a decorative bronze door depicting the distressed children in purgatory. He drags Nell with him, but the benevolent spirits release her and she dies. Nell&#x27;s soul, along with those of the freed children, rises to heaven.

The following morning, Dr. Marrow and Theo meet the Dudleys at the front gate in silence and leave Hill House behind.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Filmmaker Steven Spielberg approached horror author Stephen King in 1996 about making a haunted house film, and the two agreed that Robert Wise&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Haunting&quot; was a benchmark of cinematic house horror. After collaborating on a screenplay partly based on Wise&#x27;s film (an adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;), Spielberg and King ran into creative differences, and the project was ultimately aborted. Spielberg pushed forward with the project, commissioning first-time screenwriter David Self to write a screenplay for the film. King went on to retool his rendition of the material into the 2002 miniseries &quot;Rose Red&quot;, which shares some elements of both Wise&#x27;s 1963 film, as well as Jackson&#x27;s source novel.

While Jan de Bont was working on post-production for &quot;Twister&quot;, Spielberg offered to take over directing duties on &quot;Minority Report&quot; in exchange for directing &quot;The Haunting&quot;. De Bont did not want the film to be a remake of the 1963 version, as he wanted to focus more on the book that it was adapted from.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on November 30, 1998, and ended on April 9, 1999. Harlaxton Manor, in England, was used as the exterior of Hill House while its Great Hall served as the games room scene where Marrow comforts Nell after seeing the bloodied &quot;Welcome Home Eleanor&quot; writing and where Nell reveals of Hugh Crain&#x27;s crimes, with the kitchen and pantry scenes done at Belvoir Castle. Spielberg stayed at Stapleford Park Hotel, the actors were at Belton Woods Hotel, north of Grantham, and the film crew were at the Swallow Hotel on the A607 junction on the bypass, and the Olde Barn Hotel in Marston, Lincolnshire.

The majority of the interior sets were built inside the dome-shaped hangar that once housed Hughes H-4 Hercules, near the permanently docked steamship, in Long Beach, California. The handcrafted interior sets cost an estimated $8–10 million to construct, and were designed by Argentine production designer Eugenio Zanetti.

The film was burdened by reshoots, in part because cinematographer Caleb Deschanel left over creative differences one week into filming. The studio also demanded a new ending be shot, which was completed in June 1999.

===Post-production===
Following principal photography, the film&#x27;s elaborate visual effects were completed by Phil Tippett, who had previously provided effects work on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993).

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Haunting&quot; opened theatrically in North America on July 23, 1999, screening in 2,808 theaters, and earning $33,435,140 during its opening weekend, ranking in first place ahead of &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. It was overtaken by &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; during its second weekend, falling into fourth place behind the latter film, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; with a 54.4% decline and a gross of $15.2 million. The film remained in theatrical release until November 1999. It ultimately grossed $91,411,151 in North America, and $85,900,000 in international markets, making for a worldwide gross of $177,311,151.

===Critical response===
At the time of its release, &quot;The Haunting&quot; was met with negative reviews from film critics, who criticized its screenplay, reliance on horror clichés, and use of CGI effects, but praised its art direction, production design, and sound. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Sophisticated visual effects fail to offset awkward performances and an uneven script&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 28 critic reviews, indicating “mixed or average reviews”. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, awarding it three stars out of four, and praising the production design in particular: &quot;To my surprise, I find myself recommending &quot;The Haunting&quot; based on its locations, its sets, its art direction, its sound design, and the overall splendor of its visuals. The story is a mess, but for long periods that hardly matters. It&#x27;s beside the point, as we enter one of the most striking spaces I&#x27;ve ever seen in a film.&quot; Similar sentiments were echoed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s Janet Maslin, who deemed the film &quot;a lavish illustration of how to take a fairly modest black-and-white horror film from 1963 and amplify it so relentlessly that the sight of the flying cow in &quot;Twister&quot; would not be all that amiss...  the film&#x27;s spooky tricks are orchestrated by top-notch behind-the-scenes talent, who augment Mr. De Bont&#x27;s tireless efforts to keep things moving.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Home media===
&quot;The Haunting&quot; was released on VHS and DVD by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on November 23, 1999. Following Paramount Pictures&#x27; acquisition of DreamWorks, Paramount reissued the film on DVD in October 2017.

In October 2020, Paramount released the film on Blu-ray featuring a new 4K restoration under their &quot;Paramount Presents&quot; Blu-ray line. On February 27, 2023, Scream Factory announced a forthcoming 4K UHD Blu-ray release scheduled for May 30, 2023.

<text>Earl of Grantham is a title in the Peerage of England created on 24 December 1698, along with the titles Viscount Boston, of Boston in the County of Lincoln, and Baron Alford, of Alford in the County of Lincoln, for Henry de Nassau d&#x27;Auverquerque, a British Army officer and cousin of King William III of England. The titles were created with a special remainder, failing heirs male of his body, to his three brothers Cornelius, Maurice, and Francis, in like manner respectively. Since both his sons and as well his three brothers had predeceased him, the titles became extinct upon his death in 1754. 

==Earls of Grantham (1698)==
Arms of the Earls of Grantham 
*Henry de Nassau d&#x27;Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham (1675–1754)
**Henry, Viscount Boston (1697–1718)
**Thomas, Viscount Boston (1700–1730)

==In fiction==
Screenwriter Julian Fellowes used the title, Earl of Grantham — although as a fictional one and according to the storyline created in 1772 in the Peerage of Great Britain — for one of the main characters, Robert Crawley, in his 2010 ITV1 period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. In this fictional setting, Viscount Downton was one of Crawley&#x27;s subsidiary titles.
Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1869 novel The Man Who Laughs includes a reference to the Earl of Grantham and the Earl&#x27;s Manor.

<text>Paul Georges Buissonneau, (born 24 December 1926 – 30 November 2014) was a francophone theatre director in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Born in Paris, Buissonneau started his career as a singer with the French chorus Les Compagnons de la chanson, alongside Édith Piaf who was also singing with the group at the time. He parted company with the chorus during a tour of North America, and settled in Quebec.

In 1952, the City of Montreal appointed Buissonneau as artistic director of &quot;La Roulotte&quot;, a parks-based outdoor theatre, which gave an early opportunity to famous Quebec artists Yvon Deschamps, Jean-Louis Millette, Claude Jasmin, Claude Léveillée, Marcel Sabourin and Robert Charlebois.

In 1956, he founded his own company, the Théâtre de Quat&#x27;Sous (Four-penny Theatre) and served as its artistic director until 1989. Many famous Quebec playwrights began their career in this theatre, notably Robert Lepage, François Barbeau, André Brassard, René-Daniel Dubois, and Lothaire Bluteau.

During his 35-year career as director of the &quot;Quat&#x27;Sous&quot; theatre, he played and wrote numerous plays and TV shows. He is remembered for creating and bringing to life the character of &quot;Picolo&quot; in the children&#x27;s television series entitled &quot;La Boîte à surprises&quot; (The surprise box). The series started in 1954 and lasted until the early 1970s.

He received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award in 1998 and the Prix Denise-Pelletier in 2001. In 2009, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions to the evolution of the performing arts, especially theatre, as director of the La Roulotte and Quat’Sous theatres.&quot;

<doc id="956618" wikidata="Q1800696" url="?curid=956618" title="Laika (band)">
<text>Laika were an English band formed in 1993 and helmed by Margaret Fiedler (lead vocals, programming) and Guy Fixsen (guitar, programming). Their lineup also included John Frenett (bass), Lou Ciccotelli (drums), Louise Elliott (flute, saxophone), and Rob Ellis (drums). Laika were founded following Fiedler and Frenett&#x27;s departure from the band Moonshake; Laika&#x27;s other members had previously worked with different artists on the roster of Moonshake&#x27;s label Too Pure. Laika&#x27;s experimental style blended diverse genres, including electronica, krautrock, dub, hip hop, and jazz. They released their debut album &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot; in 1994, and followed with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the Satellites&quot;, both to critical praise. Laika released two subsequent albums, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Good Looking Blues&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing&quot;, after which they entered an indefinite hiatus.

==History==
===1993: Formation===
Margaret Fiedler moved from New York City to London in 1989 in search of music which better suited her interests. The first significant band she joined was Moonshake, in which she was one of two lead vocalists, a songwriter and a multi-instrumentalist predominantly playing guitar, keyboards and samplers. Moonshake&#x27;s songwriting was split between Fiedler and co-vocalist David Callahan, who had a very different style: Callahan favoured an art-punk storytelling approach with a dub/funk undercurrent while Fiedler preferred a more enveloping and abstract approach drawing on rhythmic krautrock-esque loops and murmured vocals. The early Moonshake records, released on the Too Pure label, were engineered by the producer Guy Fixsen, who had also worked with bands including My Bloody Valentine and The Breeders.

The creative tensions in Moonshake ultimately became personal and the band broke up after a tour of the United States in 1993. While Callahan kept the Moonshake name and continued the band (along with the drummer Mig Morland and various guest musicians), Fiedler and the band&#x27;s bass guitarist John Frenett both left. Fiedler began working with Guy Fixsen as her writing and recording partner, as well as beginning a romantic relationship with him. The new partnership, with Frenett playing bass guitar, continued to develop the approach Fiedler had taken with her songs in Moonshake. The band named themselves after the Russian dog Laika, the first animal to orbit the Earth.

===1994–2000: Active recording and performance===
In Laika&#x27;s first incarnation, Fiedler, Fixsen, and Frenett were augmented by the flautist and saxophonist Louise Elliott and the drummer Lou Ciccotelli (God, Eardrum, SLAB!). On recordings and in live shows, Fiedler and Fixsen shared guitar, keyboards and sampling, with Fiedler doing most of the vocals. The group&#x27;s first album was the acclaimed &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot;, released on Too Pure in 1994. Shortly afterwards, Rob Ellis (PJ Harvey, Spleen) joined as an occasional second drummer and percussionist.

The band quickly became popular interviewees in the alternative and underground music press, its music praised for mingling intricacy, polish and accessibility with experimentation and originality. In 1995, Fiedler described her band&#x27;s music as &quot;just like trip-hop, but much much faster&quot; and declared her distaste for the then-current Britpop, citing a preference for jazz and dub. She later recalled that &quot;Guy and I were interested in rhythm but couldn&#x27;t get excited about . So, influenced by bands like The Young Gods, we wanted to take rock rhythms and turn them upside down. 7 is great!&quot;

In 1996, Laika contributed to the AIDS benefit album &quot;&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Laika&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sounds of the Satellites&quot;, was released in early 1997. Many of the previous album&#x27;s more abrasive edges were smoothed away in favour of a sleeker, though not much less experimental, dance tone. The group continued to attract a lot of press attention, particularly when they supported Radiohead on tour, and continued to be an underground favourite, despite not having a hit. A third album, &quot;Good Looking Blues&quot;, was released in 2000. The same year, Fiedler played in PJ Harvey&#x27;s backing band on an extensive world tour promoting Harvey&#x27;s album &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot;. On this tour, she played guitar, cello and other instruments. In 2003, Laika released a collection of singles, B-sides, and rarities entitled &quot;Lost in Space: Volume 1 (1993–2002)&quot;.

===2003: Final recordings and hiatus===
Up until 2003, each Laika release had been a full band recording involving, at the very least, Elliott and Frenett as players. This changed in 2003 with &quot;Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing&quot;, which was recorded by Fiedler and Fixsen alone but with Lou Ciccotelli remaining as the percussionist. The band were dismayed by the album&#x27;s poor commercial reception, apparently selling less than any of its predecessors. Fiedler has subsequently blamed online file sharing for Laika&#x27;s sudden dip in sales, commenting: &quot;We (had) sold steadily more and more until the last one which didn&#x27;t do so well. And that coincided time-wise with everyone getting broadband. People were still coming to see the live shows, so go figure.&quot;

At around this time, Fiedler and Fixsen ended their romantic relationship. Although they maintained their musical partnership, the band&#x27;s working life began to become strained. In 2009, Fiedler commented that &quot;we were a couple both personally and professionally for a long time – over ten years – and the personal side of that is over and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to work together&quot;, citing the recently defunct Stereolab as a similar example of a band driven by a central romantic partnership which suffered professionally once that relationship had ended.

In 2005, Fiedler opted to devote most of her time to law school, something which she has cited as ensuring that &quot;the band stopped being a going concern&quot;. Fixsen also took time out in order to travel the world. There were no formal announcements of a Laika break-up but the band has not released anything since &quot;Wherever I Am I Am What Is Missing&quot;. Laika is also no longer listed in the roster on the Too Pure homepage.

===Post-Laika work and possible future activity===
Fixsen continues to work as a sound engineer and producer. He co-produced English musician Lonelady&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Nerve Up&quot;. Fiedler, now known by her married name of Mags McGinnis, has divided time between several ventures, including music, writing, candlemaking, working in copyright law for the BBC, and running the rights clearance service Mineral Point Music Ltd. She played rhythm guitar for English rock band Wire on their 2008 tour of Europe and North America, replacing Bruce Gilbert. Fiedler has stated that &quot;the decline of album sales due to illegal downloads made [her] recording and songwriting careers less financially viable&quot;.

Fixsen has claimed that Laika are &quot;taking a break&quot; with about half of an album already recorded, and that he and Fiedler will reconvene and complete the tracks at a future date. While Fiedler has not entirely discounted this suggestion or stated that Laika have formally split up, she has cited the difficulties of working with a former romantic partner on any project, as well as the obstacle of her current work. She has, however, admitted that it would be &quot;great to finish (the album)&quot; as well as to play some shows and tour some of the places which Laika did not visit during the band&#x27;s active lifetime.

==Sound==
Musically, the band drew from a variety of sources, including dub, trip hop, and drum and bass, as well as more atmospheric and &quot;dreamy&quot; pop approaches. Their work utilizes both electronic and organic approach to songwriting with live drums and percussion, together with guitars and samples, creating a complex layered and polyrhythmic blend of beats and diverse analogue sounds that defies simple categorization. They were among the first wave of bands to be classified as post-rock; in a 1994 article in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; profiling the genre, journalist Simon Reynolds described Laika&#x27;s sound as a &quot;blend of machine-music and flesh-and-blood funk... combining the &#x27;magical&#x27;, superhuman effects of sampling with the &#x27;warmth&#x27; that comes from real-time interaction between players&quot;.

<text>Earl of Marlborough is a title that has been created twice, both times in the Peerage of England. The first time was in 1626 in favour of James Ley, 1st Baron Ley, and the second was in 1689 for John Churchill, 1st Baron Churchill, the future Duke of Marlborough.

==History==
The first creation came on 5 February 1626 in favour of James Ley, 1st Baron Ley, Lord Chief Justice and Lord High Treasurer. He had already been created a baronet, of Westbury in the County of Wiltshire, in the Baronetage of England in 1619, and Baron Ley, of Ley in the County of Devon, on 31 December 1624, in the Peerage of England. His eldest son, who served as Custos Rotulorum of Somerset, was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Ley by writ of acceleration in 1628. He succeeded his father in the earldom the next year. He was in turn succeeded by his only son, the third Earl, in 1838. He was a naval commander and was killed at the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665. He was unmarried and was succeeded by his uncle, William Ley, who became the fourth Earl. He married Miss Hewet, daughter of Sir William Hewet, but as he died without issue, in 1679, the baronetcy, the barony, and the earldom became extinct.

The second creation came on 9 April 1689, when John Churchill, 1st Baron Churchill, was created Earl of Marlborough, in the County of Wiltshire, for his role in the Glorious Revolution. He was subsequently created Duke of Marlborough, and the earldom has since descended with the dukedom.

<text>A volcanic field is an area of Earth&#x27;s crust that is prone to localized volcanic activity. The type and number of volcanoes required to be called a &quot;field&quot; is not well-defined. Volcanic fields usually consist of clusters of up to 100 volcanoes such as cinder cones. Lava flows may also occur. They may occur as a monogenetic volcanic field or a polygenetic volcanic field. 

==Description==
Alexander von Humboldt observed in 1823 that geologically young volcanoes are not distributed uniformly across the Earth&#x27;s surface, but tend to be clustered into specific regions. Young volcanoes are rarely found within cratons, but are characteristic of subduction zones, rift zones, or in ocean basins. Intraplate volcanoes are clustered along hotspot traces. 

Within regions of volcanic activity, volcanic fields are clusters of volcanoes that share a common magma source. Unlike a large volcano with satellite or subsidiary vents, a volcanic field&#x27;s vents have their own source of magma, possibly of different compositions (such as basalt and rhyolite), and these vents may span an area of thousands of square miles. Scoria cones are particularly prone to cluster into volcanic fields, which are typically in diameter and consist of several tens to several hundred individual cones. The unusually large Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt has nearly 1000 cones covering an area of .

<text>Martin Rossiter Hoke (born May 18, 1952) is an American Republican politician, former member of the Ohio Casino Control Commission, and former member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio.

==Biography==
Hoke was born in Lakewood, Ohio, and attended school at the private Western Reserve Academy. He graduated from Amherst College in 1973 and earned a J.D. degree from Case Western Reserve University in 1980. He has been noted for practicing Sikhism.

===Business career===

In 1981, Hoke began a company, Red Carpet Airport Car Care, that provided auto repair services at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Four years later, he founded Red Carpet Cellular, a distributor of then-novel cellular telephones, which became the largest distributor of cell phones in Ohio. Hoke sold the company to British Petroleum in 1988. Verizon acquired the company in 1991. In 2007 Hoke developed an idea for a nasal irrigation system, partly to allay his own sinusitis. His creation evolved into Rhinosystems, Inc. of Brooklyn, OH, manufacturer of the patented Navage nasal irrigator, currently sold in Canada and the United States. In 2020, New York Magazine rated Navage the “Best Nasal Irrigation System.”

===Political career===

In 1992, Hoke won the Republican nomination for Ohio&#x27;s 10th congressional district, located in Cleveland&#x27;s west side. Hoke upset heavily favored Democrat Mary Rose Oakar, who had represented the district (formerly the 20th District) for 16 years, in the general election. Oakar was hampered by writing bad checks at the House of Representatives Bank, one of many members who were entangled in the House banking scandal. Hoke was the first Republican to represent a significant portion of traditionally heavily Democratic Cleveland in over 30 years. Hoke won re-election in 1994 against Frank Gaul, a Cuyahoga County Treasurer who had recently overseen losses in a county bond fund based on faulty advice from private bond counsel. In 1996, Hoke was defeated by former Cleveland mayor Dennis Kucinich 49%-46%. Hoke was harmed by several gaffes he had made, the Democratic nature of the district, strong labor support for Kucinich, and a mounting public perception that he would lose.

Hoke was appointed to the Ohio Casino Control Commission by Governor John Kasich on February 23, 2011. His term of office ended on February 21, 2017.

==Controversy==
Following the 1994 State of the Union speech by President Bill Clinton, Hoke was preparing to be interviewed for a live broadcast for a local Cleveland television station. After being outfitted with a microphone by a female producer, Hoke remarked to Democratic fellow Cleveland-area congressman Eric Fingerhut that &quot;She&#x27;s got ze beega breasts&quot; in a mock Italian accent. Although not broadcast live, the remark was recorded, and was the subject of a report by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; the following day. Coverage of the remark may have been a factor in his failed bid for re-election in 1996.

<doc id="956642" wikidata="Q3687833" url="?curid=956642" title="Earl of Brentford">
<text>Earl of Brentford was a title that was created twice in Peerage of England. It was first created in 1644 when the Scottish soldier and diplomat Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth, was made Earl of Brentford, in the County of Middlesex. He had already been created Lord Ruthven of Ettrick in 1639 and Earl of Forth in 1642, both in the Peerage of Scotland. He had no surviving male issue and the titles became extinct on his death in 1651. Lord Brentford was a great-grandson of William Ruthven, 1st Lord Ruthven (see Earl of Gowrie for earlier history of the family). His brother William Ruthven was the grandfather of Francis Ruthven, who was created a Baronet, of Redcastle, in 1666 (see Ruthven Baronets). The latter married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Ruthven, 1st Lord Ruthven of Freeland, great-grandson of William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven. Their daughter, Isabel (or Isobel), succeeded as 5th Lady Ruthven of Freeland in 1722 (see Lord Ruthven of Freeland for further history of this title).

The second creation of the earldom of Brentford came in 1689 in favour of Frederick Schomberg, who was also created Duke of Schomberg. For more information on this creation of the earldom, see Duke of Schomberg.

<text>Louise Charron, (born March 2, 1951) is a Canadian jurist. She was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in October, 2004, and is the first native-born Franco-Ontarian Supreme Court judge. (This distinction has sometimes been attributed to Louise Arbour, but Arbour was born and raised Québécoise.)

Born in Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, Charron received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton University in 1972, her Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Ottawa in 1975, and was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1977. She practiced civil litigation before joining the Crown Attorney&#x27;s office in 1980. She then became a law professor at the University of Ottawa.

She was appointed to the District Court of Ontario in 1988 and to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 1995. Though she was eligible to sit on the bench until 2026, her retirement was announced in May 2011, and became effective August 30, 2011. She was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2012.

<text>Sturgeon Falls is a community and former town in Nipissing District, Ontario, located on the Sturgeon River. The community had a population of 6,939 at the 2021 census and a density of 1,129/km2 (2,920 sq mi). Following a failed legal challenge in 1997, the community was merged into the municipality of West Nipissing in 1999.

== History ==
Ojibwe and Algonquin tribes first settled in the Sturgeon Falls area thousands of years ago. Discovered by European fur traders in the 17th century, the development of Sturgeon Falls began with the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. French Canadians immigrated to the community from Simcoe and Muskoka following the establishment of lumber and pulp and paper industries. Sturgeon Falls was officially incorporated as a town in 1895, with a population of 850.

== Demographics ==

At the 2021 census, the community had a population of 6,939 with a density of 1,129/km2 (2,920 sq mi). The population increases by approximately 0.070% annually.

In 2016, the community consisted of 53.8% women and 46.3% men. The vast majority of residents were born in Canada, with immigrants making up only 2.5% of the population. 61.8% reported French as their first language, and 34.2% reported English. The people of Sturgeon Falls have advocated for French-speaking rights since its beginning. In 1930, 75-80% of residents were French speaking.

<doc id="956647" wikidata="Q5326252" url="?curid=956647" title="Earl of Derwentwater">
<text>Earl of Derwentwater (pronounced &quot;Durwentwater&quot;) was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1688 for Sir Francis Radclyffe, 3rd Baronet. He was made Baron Tyndale, of Tyndale in the County of Northumberland, and Viscount Radclyffe and Langley at the same time, also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl, who married Lady Mary Tudor, daughter of Charles II by his mistress Moll Davis.

Their eldest son, the third Earl, was a prominent Jacobite. In 1716, he was convicted of high treason, attainted and executed on Tower Hill in London. Despite having been stripped of his titles through the attainder, his only son John, titular 4th Earl of Derwentwater, continued to use them. On John&#x27;s early death in 1731, they were claimed by his uncle, Charles Radclyffe, titular 5th Earl. He was also a Jacobite but managed to escape to France after the 1715 rebellion, where he was secretary to Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;). However, he was captured by British forces in 1746, condemned to death and beheaded. Charles married Charlotte Maria, 3rd Countess of Newburgh. Their eldest son, James, succeeded his mother as 4th Earl of Newburgh and his father as titular 6th Earl of Derwentwater.
James&#x27;s son Anthony succeeded in the titles on his father&#x27;s death in 1787. The male line died out on his death in 1814, when the Radclyffe titles became technically extinct, and have not been used since; but he was succeeded in the earldom of Newburgh by an Italian kinsman (see Earl of Newburgh for further history of this title).
The Baronetcy, of Derwentwater in the County of Cumberland, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1620 for Francis Radclyffe.

*James Bartholomew Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Newburgh and titular 6th Earl of Derwentwater (1725–1787)
*Anthony James Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Newburgh and titular 7th Earl of Derwentwater (1757–1814)

There are occasional references to James, the last Earl of Derwentwater, in various 18th Century publications. This is most generally taken to refer to James the 3rd Earl, but each needs to be considered in context as James Bartholomew Radclyffe was the last to use the title as a matter of course, between 1746 when his father Charles Radclyffe was executed and the death of his mother, the suo jure Countess of Newburgh, when James Bartholomew commenced calling himself by the unattainted title, Earl of Newburgh.

==Claimants to the title==
In 1814, William Radclyffe (1770-1828) of Darley Hall, Worsborough, made claim to be the next legitimate heir to the title. In 1816, it was discovered that Radclyffe, who had in 1803 been appointed as Rouge Croix Pursuivant, a member of the College of Arms, had used his position to alter entries in the Parish Register of Ravensfield to substantiate his false claim. He was found guilty of forgery at York Assizes in March 1820, resigned from the College of Arms in 1823.

In the mid-19th Century the so-called &quot;Mad&quot; Countess of Derwentwater, a woman calling herself Amelia Mary Tudor Radcliffe, took possession of Dilston Castle and claimed that the titular 4th Earl John had not died at age 19, but had faked his own death and relocated to Germany to avoid Hanoverian agents. There he had married and had a family. The &quot;Countess&quot; claimed to be the great-granddaughter of John Radcliffe and for a time gained many followers. Whether her story was true or otherwise, it is certain that she was not a &quot;Countess of Derwentwater&quot; as the title could not be inherited through a female line.

==Estates after the attainder==

The family estates were not forfeited on the attainder of the 3rd Earl, because his son&#x27;s right to them under his marriage settlement was established before the Court of Delegates on appeal from the Forfeited Estates Commission, but the forfeiture took effect on his death in 1731. The estates were granted to Greenwich Hospital in 1735. However, after the execution of Charles Ratcliffe in 1746, his son James, Lord Kinnard, claimed them. This claim was compromised by £30,000 being paid to him and his siblings. On his death in 1746, his son obtained an annuity of £2500 for himself and his widow. The estates remained in the hands of the Hospital Commissioners until 1865, when they were transferred by the Greenwich Hospital Act 1865 to the Admiralty Board, who sold them.

<text>IDL (Interface Description Language) is a software interface description language (or interface descriptor language) created by William Wulf and John Nestor of Carnegie Mellon University and David Lamb of Queen&#x27;s University, Canada.

==History==
Like other interface description languages, IDL defined interfaces in a language- and machine- independent way, allowing the specification of interfaces between components written in different languages, and possibly executing on different machines using remote procedure calls.

The Karlsruhe Ada compilation system used IDL resp. DIANA and its predecessor AIDA, and for marshalling the vanilla IDL External Representation.

BiiN&#x27;s DBMS used IDL as well, and for marshalling a more compact binary IDL External Representation.

<doc id="956656" wikidata="Q192503" url="?curid=956656" title="Maar">
<text>A maar is a broad, low-relief volcanic crater caused by a phreatomagmatic eruption (an explosion which occurs when groundwater comes into contact with hot lava or magma). A maar characteristically fills with water to form a relatively shallow crater lake, which may also be called a maar.

Maars range in size from across and from deep. Most maars fill with water to form natural lakes. Most maars have low rims composed of a mixture of loose fragments of volcanic rocks and rocks torn from the walls of the diatreme.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;maar&quot; comes from a Moselle Franconian dialect word used for the circular lakes of the Daun area of Germany. The word evolved from its first use in German in the modern geological sense in 1819 and is now used in English and in the geological sciences as the term for the explosion crater, even if water from rainfall might always have drained from the crater after the formation event. This extension in meaning was due to recognising that the lake may no longer exist. Since maar lakes are formed after initially ground or subsurface water interacts with a magma intrusion to create an explosion crater, the name came to be used for the crater type as well. The present definition of the term relates to both its common and scientific discourse use in language over two centuries. Depending upon context there may be other descriptors available to use in the geological sciences such as the term tuff ring or &quot;maar-diatreme&quot; volcanoes. These last are volcanoes produced by explosive eruptions that cut deeply into the country rock with the maar being &quot;the crater cut into the ground and surrounded by an ejecta ring&quot;. A 2011 geological clarification of a maar is &quot;Maar volcanoes are distinguished from other small volcanoes in having craters with their floor lying below the pre-eruptive surface&quot;.

== Maar lakes and dry maars ==
&quot;Maar lakes&quot;, also referred to simply as &quot;maars&quot;, occur when groundwater or precipitation fills the funnel-shaped and usually round hollow of the maar depression formed by volcanic explosions. Examples of these types of maar are the three maars at Daun in the Eifel mountains of Germany.

A &quot;dry maar&quot; results when a maar lake dries out, becomes aggraded or silted up. An example of the latter is the Eckfelder Maar. Near Steffeln is the Eichholzmaar (also called the &quot;Gussweiher&quot;) which has dried out during the last century and is being renaturalised into a maar. In some cases the underlying rock is so porous that maar lakes are unable to form. After winters of heavy snow and rainfall many dry maars fill partially and temporarily with water; others contain small bogs or often artificial ponds that, however, only occupy part of the hollow.

== Distribution ==
The largest known maars are found at Espenberg on the Seward Peninsula in northwest Alaska. These maars range in size from in diameter and a depth up to . These eruptions occurred in a period of about 100,000 years, with the youngest (the Devil Mountain Maar) occurring about 17,500 years ago. Their large size is due to the explosive reaction that occurs when magma comes into contact with permafrost. Hydromagmatic eruptions are increasingly explosive when the ratio of water to magma is low. Since permafrost melts slowly, it provides a steady source of water to the eruption while keeping the water to magma ratio low. This produces the prolonged, explosive eruptions that created these large maars. Examples of the Seward Peninsula maars include North Killeak Maar, South Killeak Maar, Devil Mountain Maar and Whitefish Maar.

Maars occur in western North America, Patagonia in South America, the Eifel region of Germany (where they were originally described), and in other geologically young volcanic regions of Earth. Elsewhere in Europe, La Vestide du Pal, a maar in the Ardèche department of France, is easily visible from the ground or air. Kilbourne Hole and Hunt&#x27;s Hole, in southern New Mexico near El Paso, Texas, are maars. The Crocodile Lake in Los Baños in the Philippines, though originally thought to be a volcanic crater, is a maar. The carbon dioxide-saturated Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon is another example, as is Zuñi Salt Lake in New Mexico, a shallow saline lake that occupies a flat-floored crater about across and deep. Its low rim is composed of loose pieces of basaltic lava and wall rocks (sandstone, shale, limestone) of the underlying diatreme, as well as chunks of ancient crystalline rocks blasted upward from great depths. Maars in Canada are found in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field of east-central British Columbia and in kimberlite fields throughout Canada. Another field of maars is found in the Pali-Aike Volcanic Field in Patagonia, South America. and in the Sudanese Bayuda Volcanic Field. The Auckland volcanic field in the urban area of Auckland, New Zealand, has several maars, including the readily accessible Lake Pupuke in the North Shore suburb of Takapuna.

Arizona&#x27;s Meteor Crater was for many years thought to be a maar of volcanic origin but it is now known to be an impact crater.

=== Examples ===
==== Germany ====
===== Eifel maars =====

In the Volcanic Eifel there are about 75 maars. Both lake-filled and dry maars are typical, though the latter are more common. The last eruptions took place at least 11,000 years ago, and many maars are older, as evidenced by their heavy erosion and less obvious shapes and volcanic features.

====== Water-filled maars of the Eifel ======

====== Dry maars of the Eifel ======
In the Eifel and Volcanic Eifel there are numerous dry maars:
* Mosbrucher Weiher (4 km SE of Kelberg)
* Booser Doppelmaar (W of Boos; near Kelberg)
* Dreiser Weiher (W of Dreis-Brück, N of Daun)
* Dürres Maar (SW of Gillenfeld)
* Duppacher Weiher (near Duppach, NW of Gerolstein)
* Geeser Maar (E of Gerolstein, N of Gees)
* Eckfelder Maar (near Eckfeld)
* Eigelbacher Maar (near Kopp, county of Daun; maar basin: c. 1200 m × 1200 m)
* Hitsche Maar (NW of the Dürre Maar, smallest Eifel maar; Ø = 60 m)
* Immerather Risch (Middle Low German: &quot;risch&quot; = reed bed; N of the Immerather Maar)
* Gerolsteiner Maar (NE of Gerolstein)
* Schalkenmehrener Maar E (of Schalkenmehren)
* Schönfelder Maar (SW of Stadtkyll-Schönfeld)
* Steffelner Laach or &quot;Laach Maar&quot; (near Steffeln)
* Dehner Maar (near Reuth)
* Walsdorfer Maar (&quot;Schilierwiese&quot;; S of Walsdorf; maar basin: c. 1150 m × 1000 m)
* Wollmerather Maar (near Wollmerath)

====== Broader use of the term &quot;maar&quot; ======
The following volcanic features are often colloquially referred to as a &quot;maar&quot; or &quot;maar lake&quot;, although they are not, strictly speaking, maars:
* Windsborn Crater Lake and Hinkelsmaar in the Manderscheid Volcano Group near Bettenfeld, crater lakes of the Mosenberg (Eifel)|Mosenberg
* Laacher See near Maria Laach, lake in a caldera of the Laacher See volcano
* Strohner Märchen (south of the Pulvermaar), volcanic pipe which has become a maar
* Papenkaule, a volcanic crater, and the associated eruption site of the Hagelskaule
* Elfenmaar near Bad Bertrich, an almost entirely eroded stratovolcano
* Rodder Maar near Niederdürenbach, the origin of which is unclear 

===== Maars outside the Eifel =====
In Germany there are also several maars outside of the Eifel. A well-known example is the Messel pit, a former maar lake near Messel in the county of Darmstadt-Dieburg and which is known for its well preserved fossils. In addition in the Swabian Jura and the Albvorland (the Swabian Volcano) there are maar-forming volcanoes. Because the over 350 eruption points were only active in the Upper Miocene 17 to 11 million years ago, all the maars, apart from the dry maar, Randecker Maar and the Molach, are only detectable geologically. In the Ore Mountains near Hammerunterwiesenthal, the Hammerunterwiesenthal Maar formed about 30 million years ago during the Oligocene; the maar measures 2 kilometres from east to west and 1.4 kilometres from north to south.

==== Rest of Europe ====

The Chaîne des Puys in France contains numerous maars; Lake Albano in the Alban Mountains is a complex maar, and there is also a submarine maar (Kolumbo) near Santorini in Greece. The Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Field in Spain contains numerous maars; a typical example being the maar of Hoya del Mortero at Poblete in the Province of Ciudad Real.

Active maars were commonplace in Fife and Lothian, Scotland during the Carboniferous period. The location of one such maar was Elie Ness.

==== Americas ====
Active maar volcanoes are mainly known outside Europe.

In the US there are numerous maar areas, such as in Alaska (Ukinrek maars, Nunivak in the Bering Sea); in Washington (Battle Ground Lake); in Oregon (Fort Rock basin with the maars of Big Hole, Hole-in-the-Ground, Table Rock); in Death Valley National Park, California (Ubehebe Crater); in Nevada (Soda Lakes); as well as the maars of the White Rock Canyon, Mount Taylor, the Potrillo volcanic fields (Kilbourne Hole and Hunt&#x27;s Hole), and Zuñi Salt Lake in New Mexico.

In Central Mexico, the Tarascan volcanic field contains several maars in the states of Michoacán and Guanajuato. In Nicaragua is the maar of Laguna de Xiloa, part of the Apoyeque volcano. From South America, there are known maars in Chile (e.g. Cerro Overo and Cerro Tujle in northern Chile). Jayu Khota is a maar in Bolivia.

==== Middle East and Africa ====
The maar of Lake Ram lies on the Golan Heights; further south maars occur in Africa (Bilate Volcanic Field and Haro Maja in the Butajiri-Silti-Volcanic Field, Ethiopia, the Bayuda Volcanic Field in the Sudan and Lake Nyos in the Oku Volcanic Field in Cameroon). In Saudi Arabia the Al Wahbah crater formed as a result of a maar eruption.

==== Asia and Oceania ====
In Japan there are maars in the Kirishima-Yaku volcanic field in the Kirishima-Yaku National Park on Kyushu. These include the several maars of the Ibusuki volcanic field such as Lake Unagi. On Honshu in Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park there is Kagamiike Pond as well as many on the volcanic island of Miyake-jima, Izu Islands (Furumio, Mi&#x27;ike, Mizutamari, Shinmio).

Koranga Maar and Numundo Maar are in Papua New Guinea. Kawah Masemo maar is on Mount Sempu volcano in Indonesia. The San Pablo Volcanic Field in the Province of Laguna on the island of Luzon in the Philippines contains maars.

The Newer Volcanics Province in the States of South Australia and Victoria, Australia, has numerous maars, such as Mount Gambier, Mount Schank and Tower Hill, whose complex system of nested maars is enclosed by one of the largest maars in the world.

Foulden Maar in Otago, New Zealand, is an important fossil site, but there are many more maars in New Zealand. As already mentioned these include Lake Pupuke, but the Auckland volcanic field has other easily accessible maars such as the Mangere Lagoon, Orakei Basin, Panmure Basin, and Pukaki Lagoon. Elsewhere a recent example, only 4000 years old, is Lake Rotokawau in the Bay of Plenty Region.

<text>Chu (, Old Chinese: &quot;&amp;ast;s-r̥aʔ&quot;) was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. Their first ruler was King Wu of Chu in the early 8th century BC. Chu was located in the south of the Zhou heartland and lasted during the Spring and Autumn period. At the end of the Warring States period it was destroyed by Qin in 223 BC during Qin&#x27;s wars of unification.

Also known as Jing () and Jingchu (), Chu included most of the present-day provinces of Hubei and Hunan, along with parts of Chongqing, Guizhou, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. For more than 400 years, the Chu capital Danyang was located at the junction of the Dan and Xi Rivers near present-day Xichuan County, Henan, but later moved to Ying. The house of Chu originally bore the ancestral temple surname Nai ( OC: /*rneːlʔ/) which was later written as Mi ( OC: /*meʔ/). They also bore the lineage name Yan ( OC: /*qlamʔ/, /*qʰɯːm/) which would later be written Xiong ( OC: /*ɢʷlɯm/).

==History==

===Founding===
According to legends recounted in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, the ruling family of Chu descended from the Yellow Emperor and his grandson and successor Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu&#x27;s great-grandson Wuhui () was put in charge of fire by Emperor Ku and given the title Zhurong. Wuhui&#x27;s son Luzhong () had six sons, all born by Caesarian section. The youngest, Jilian, adopted the ancestral surname Mi. &#x27;s descendant Yuxiong was the teacher of King Wen of Zhou (r. 1099–1050 BC). After the Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, King Cheng (r. 1042–1021 BC) enfeoffed Yuxiong&#x27;s great-grandson Xiong Yi with the fiefdom of Chu in the Nanyang Basin and the hereditary title of (&quot;zǐ&quot;, &quot;viscount&quot;). Then the first capital of Chu was established at Danyang (present-day Xichuan in Henan).

Sinologist Yuri Pines wrote that Chu originated as a normative Zhou polity that gradually developed cultural assertiveness in tandem with the increase in its political power, rather than being a &quot;barbarian entity&quot; drawn to the glory of the Zhou culture as suggested in the &quot;Mencius,&quot; and that divergent cultural patterns associated with Chu only emerged during the Spring and Autumn period.

===Western Zhou===
In 977 BC, during his campaign against Chu, King Zhao of Zhou&#x27;s boat sank and he drowned in the Han River. After this death, Zhou ceased to expand to the south, allowing the southern tribes and Chu to cement their own autonomy much earlier than the states to the north. The Chu viscount Xiong Qu overthrew E in 863 BC but subsequently made its capital Ezhou one of his capitals. In either 703 or 706, the ruler Xiong Tong became the ruler of Chu.

===Spring and Autumn period===
Under the reign of King Zhuang, Chu reached the height of its power and its ruler was considered one of the five Hegemons of the era. After a number of battles with neighboring states, sometime between 695 and 689 BC, the Chu capital moved south-east from Danyang to Ying. Chu first consolidated its power by absorbing other states in its original area (modern Hubei), then it expanded into the north towards the North China Plain. In the summer of 648 BC, the State of Huang was annexed by the state of Chu.

The threat from Chu resulted in multiple northern alliances under the leadership of Jin. These alliances kept Chu in check, and the Chu kingdom lost their first major battle at the Chengpu in 632 BC. During the 6th century BC, Jin and Chu fought numerous battles over the hegemony of central plain. In 597 BC, Jin was defeated by Chu in the battle of Bi, causing Jin&#x27;s temporary inability to counter Chu&#x27;s expansion. Chu strategically used the state of Zheng as its representative in the central plain area, through the means of intimidation and threats, Chu forced Zheng to ally with itself. On the other hand, Jin had to balance out Chu&#x27;s influence by repeatedly allying with Lu, Wey, and Song. The tension between Chu and Jin did not loosen until the year of 579 BC when a truce was signed between the two states.

At the beginning of the sixth century BC, Jin strengthened the state of Wu near the Yangtze delta to act as a counterweight against Chu. Wu defeated Qi and then invaded Chu in 506 BC. Following the Battle of Boju, it occupied Chu&#x27;s capital at Ying, forcing King Zhao to flee to his allies in Yun and &quot;Sui&quot;. King Zhao eventually returned to Ying but, after another attack from Wu in 504 BC, he temporarily moved the capital into the territory of the former state of Ruo. Chu began to strengthen Yue in modern Zhejiang to serve as allies against Wu. Yue was initially subjugated by King Fuchai of Wu until he released their king Goujian, who took revenge for his former captivity by crushing and completely annexing Wu.

===Warring States period===

Freed from its difficulties with Wu, Chu annexed Chen in 479 BC and overran Cai to the north in 447 BC. By the end of the 5th century BC, the Chu government had become very corrupt and inefficient, with much of the state&#x27;s treasury used primarily to pay for the royal entourage. Many officials had no meaningful task except taking money and Chu&#x27;s army, while large, was of low quality.

In the late 390s BC, King Dao of Chu made Wu Qi his chancellor. Wu&#x27;s reforms began to transform Chu into an efficient and powerful state in 389 BC, as he lowered the salaries of officials and removed useless officials. He also enacted building codes to make the capital Ying seem less barbaric. Despite Wu Qi&#x27;s unpopularity among Chu&#x27;s ruling class, his reforms strengthened the king and left the state very powerful until the late 4th century BC, when Zhao and Qin were ascendant. Chu&#x27;s powerful army once again became successful, defeating the states of Wei and Yue. Yue was partitioned between Chu and Qi in either 334 or 333 BC. However, the officials of Chu wasted no time in their revenge and Wu Qi was assassinated at King Dao&#x27;s funeral in 381 BC. Prior to Wu&#x27;s service in the state of Chu, Wu lived in the state of Wei, where his military analysis of the six opposing states was recorded in his magnum opus, &quot;The Book of Master Wu&quot;. Of Chu, he said:

During the late Warring States period, Chu was increasingly pressured by Qin to its west, especially after Qin enacted and preserved the Legalistic reforms of Shang Yang. In 241 BC, five of the seven major warring states–Chu, Zhao, Wei, Yan and Han–formed an alliance to fight the rising power of Qin. King Kaolie of Chu was named the leader of the alliance and Lord Chunshen the military commander. According to historian Yang Kuan, the Zhao general Pang Nuan () was the actual commander in the battle. The allies attacked Qin at the strategic Hangu Pass but were defeated. King Kaolie blamed Lord Chunshen for the loss and began to mistrust him. Afterwards, Chu moved its capital east to Shouchun, farther away from the threat of Qin.

As Qin expanded into Chu&#x27;s territory, Chu was forced to expand southwards and eastwards, absorbing local cultural influences along the way. Lu was conquered by King Kaolie in 223 BC. By the late 4th century BC, however, Chu&#x27;s prominent status had fallen into decay. As a result of several invasions headed by Zhao and Qin, Chu was eventually completely wiped out by Qin.

===Defeat===
The Chu state was completely eradicated by the Qin dynasty.
According to the &quot;Records of the Warring States&quot;, a debate between the Diplomat strategist Zhang Yi and the Qin general Sima Cuo led to two conclusions concerning the unification of China. Zhang Yi argued in favor of conquering Han and seizing the Mandate of Heaven from the powerless Zhou king would be wise. Sima Cuo, however, considered that the primary difficulty was not legitimacy but the strength of Qin&#x27;s opponents; he argued that &quot;conquering Shu is conquering Chu&quot; and, &quot;once Chu is eliminated, the country will be united&quot;.

The importance of Shu in the Sichuan Basin was its great agricultural output and its control over the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, leading directly into the Chu heartland. King Huiwen of Qin opted to support Sima Cuo. In 316 BC, Qin invaded and conquered Shu and nearby Ba, expanding downriver in the following decades. In 278 BC, the Qin general Bai Qi finally conquered Chu&#x27;s capital at Ying. Following the fall of Ying, the Chu government moved to various locations in the east until settling in Shouchun in 241 BC. After a massive two-year struggle, Bai Qi lured the main Zhao force of 400,000 men onto the field, surrounding them and forcing their surrender at Changping in 260 BC. The Qin army massacred their prisoners, removing the last major obstacle to Qin dominance over the Chinese states.

By 225 BC, only four kingdoms remained: Qin, Chu, Yan, and Qi. Chu had recovered sufficiently to mount serious resistance. Despite its size, resources, and manpower, though, Chu&#x27;s corrupt government worked against it. In 224 BC, Ying Zheng called for a meeting with his subjects to discuss his plans for the invasion of Chu. Wang Jian said that the invasion force needed to be at least 600,000 strong, while Li Xin thought that less than 200,000 men would be sufficient. Ying Zheng ordered Li Xin and Meng Wu to lead the army against Chu.

The Chu army, led by Xiang Yan, secretly followed Li Xin&#x27;s army for three days and three nights, before launching a surprise offensive and destroying Li Xin army. Upon learning of Li&#x27;s defeat, Ying Zheng replaced Li with Wang Jian, putting Wang in command of the 600,000-strong army he had requested earlier and placing Meng Wu beneath him as a deputy. Worried that the Qin tyrant might fear the power he now possessed and order him executed upon some pretense, Wang Jian constantly sent messengers back to the king in order to remain in contact and reduce the king&#x27;s suspicion.

Wang Jian&#x27;s army passed through southern Chen (; present-day Huaiyang in Henan) and made camp at Pingyu. The Chu armies under Xiang Yan used their full strength against the camp but failed. Wang Jian ordered his troops to defend their positions firmly but avoid advancing further into Chu territory. After failing to lure the Qin army into an attack, Xiang Yan ordered a retreat; Wang Jian seized this opportunity to launch a swift assault. The Qin forces pursued the retreating Chu forces to Qinan (; northwest of present-day Qichun in Hubei) and Xiang Yan was either killed in the action or committed suicide following his defeat.

The next year, in 223 BC, Qin launched another campaign and captured the Chu capital Shouchun. King Fuchu was captured and his state annexed. The following year, Wang Jian and Meng Wu led the Qin army against Wuyue around the mouth of the Yangtze, capturing the descendants of the royal family of Yue. These conquered territories became the Kuaiji Prefecture of the Qin Empire.

At their peak, Chu and Qin together fielded over 1,000,000 troops, more than the massive Battle of Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years before. The excavated personal letters of two regular Qin soldiers, Hei Fu () and Jing (), tell of a protracted campaign in Huaiyang under Wang Jian. Both soldiers wrote letters requesting supplies of clothing and money from home to sustain the long waiting campaign.

===Qin and Han dynasties===
The Chu populace in areas conquered by Qin openly ignored the stringent Qin laws and governance, as recorded in the excavated bamboo slips of a Qin administrator in Hubei. Chu aspired to overthrow the painful yoke of Qin rule and re-establishing a separate state. The attitude was captured in a Chinese expression about implacable hostility: &quot;Though Chu has but three clans, Qin shall fall by Chu&#x27;s hand&quot; ().

After Ying Zheng declared himself the First Emperor (Shi Huangdi) and reigned briefly, the people of Chu and its former ruling house organized the first violent insurrections against the new Qin administration. They were especially resentful of the Qin corvée; folk poems record the mournful sadness of Chu families whose men worked in the frigid north to construct the Great Wall of China.

The Dazexiang Uprising occurred in 209 BC under the leadership of a Chu peasant, Chen Sheng, who proclaimed himself &quot;King of Rising Chu&quot; (&quot;Zhangchu&quot;). This uprising was crushed by the Qin army but it inspired a new wave of other rebellions. One of the leaders, Jing Ju of Chu, proclaimed himself the new king of Chu. Jing Ju was defeated by another rebel force under Xiang Liang. Xiang installed Xiong Xin, a scion of Chu&#x27;s traditional royal family, on the throne of Chu under the regnal name King Huai II. In 206 BC, after the fall of the Qin Empire, Xiang Yu, Xiang Liang&#x27;s nephew, proclaimed himself the &quot;Hegemon-King of Western Chu&quot; and promoted King Huai II to &quot;Emperor Yi&quot;. He subsequently had Yi assassinated. Xiang Yu then engaged with Liu Bang, another prominent anti-Qin rebel, in a long struggle for supremacy over the lands of the former Qin Empire, which became known as the Chu–Han Contention. The conflict ended in victory for Liu Bang: he proclaimed the Han dynasty and was later honored with the temple name Gaozu, while Xiang Yu committed suicide in defeat.

Liu Bang immediately enacted a more traditional and less intrusive administration than the Qin before him, made peace with the Xiongnu through heqin intermarriages, rewarded his allies with large fiefdoms, and allowed the population to rest from centuries of warfare. The core Chu territories centered in Pengcheng was granted first to general Han Xin and then to Liu Bang&#x27;s brother Liu Jiao as the Kingdom of Chu. By the time of Emperor Wu of Han, the southern folk culture and aesthetics were mixed with the Han-sponsored Confucian tradition and Qin-influenced central governance to create a distinct &quot;Chinese&quot; culture.

==Culture==

Based on the archaeological finds, Chu&#x27;s culture was initially quite similar to that of the other Zhou states of the Yellow River basin. However, subsequently, Chu absorbed indigenous elements from the Baiyue lands that it conquered to the south and east, developing a blended culture compared to the northern plains.

During the Western Zhou period, the difference between the culture of Chu and the Central Plains states to the north was negligible. Only in the late Spring and Autumn period does Chu culture begin to diverge, preserving some older aspects of the culture and developing new phenomena. It also absorbed some elements from annexed areas. The culture of Chu had significant internal diversity from locality to locality. Chu, like Qin and Yan, was often described as being not as cultured by people in the Central plains. However, this image originated with the later development of Chu relative to the Central plains, and the stereotype was retrospectively cultivated by Confucian scholars in the Qin dynasty, to indirectly criticise the ruling regime, and the Han dynasty as a means of curbing their ideological opponents who were associated with such cultural practices. As the founder of the Han dynasty was from the state, Chu culture would later become a basis of the culture of the later Han dynasty, along with that of the Qin dynasty&#x27;s and other preceding states&#x27; from the Warring States period.

Early Chu burial offerings consisted primarily of bronze vessels in the Zhou style. The bronze wares of the state of Chu also have their own characteristics. For example, the bronze Jin (altar table) unearthed from the Chu tomb in Xichuan, Henan Province are complex in shape. Dated to the mid sixth century BC, it was one of the early confirmed lost-wax cast artifacts discovered in China proper. Later Chu burials, especially during the Warring States, featured distinct burial objects, such as colorful lacquerware, iron, and silk, accompanied by a reduction in bronze vessel offerings.
A common Chu motif was the vivid depiction of wildlife, mystical animals, and natural imagery, such as snakes, dragons, phoenixes, tigers, and free-flowing clouds and serpent-like beings. Some archaeologists speculate that Chu may have had cultural connections to the previous Shang dynasty, since many motifs used by Chu appeared earlier at Shang sites such as serpent-tailed gods.

Another common Chu idea was the worship of gibbons and other animals perceived to have auspicious amounts of qi.

Later Chu culture was known for its affinity for shamans. The Chu culture and government supported Taoism and native shamanism supplemented with some Confucian glosses on Zhou ritual. Chu people affiliated themselves with the god of fire Zhurong in Chinese mythology. For this reason, fire worshiping and red coloring were practiced by Chu people.

The naturalistic and flowing art, the &quot;Songs of Chu&quot;, historical records, excavated bamboo documents such as the Guodian slips, and other artifacts reveal heavy Taoist and native folk influence in Chu culture. The disposition to a spiritual, often pleasurable and decadent lifestyle, and the confidence in the size of the Chu realm led to the inefficiency and eventual destruction of the Chu state by the ruthless Legalist state of Qin. Even though the Qin realm lacked the vast natural resources and waterways of Chu, the Qin government maximized its output under the efficient minister Shang Yang, installing a meritocracy focused solely on agricultural and military might.

Archaeological evidence shows that Chu music was annotated differently from Zhou. Chu music also showed an inclination for using different performance ensembles, as well as unique instruments. In Chu, the &quot;se&quot; was preferred over the zither, while both instruments were equally preferred in the northern Zhou states.

Chu came into frequent contact with other peoples in the south, most notably the Ba, Yue, and the Baiyue. Numerous burials and burial objects in the Ba and Yue styles have been discovered throughout the territory of Chu, co-existing with Chu-style burials and burial objects.

Some archaeological records of the Chu appear at Mawangdui. After the Han dynasty, some Confucian scholars considered Chu culture with distaste, criticizing the &quot;lewd&quot; music and shamanistic rituals associated with Chu culture.

Chu artisanship includes color, especially the lacquer woodworks. Red and black pigmented lacquer were most used. Silk-weaving also attained a high level of craftsmanship, creating lightweight robes with flowing designs. These examples (as at Mawangdui) were preserved in waterlogged tombs where the lacquer did not peel off over time and in tombs sealed with coal or white clay.
Chu used the calligraphic script called &quot;Birds and Worms&quot; style, which was borrowed by the Wu and Yue states. It has a design that embellishes the characters with motifs of animals, snakes, birds, and insects. This is another representation of the natural world and its liveliness. Chu produced broad bronze swords that were similar to Wuyue swords but not as intricate.

Chu created a riverine transport system of boats augmented by wagons. These are detailed in bronze tallies with gold inlay regarding trade along the river systems connecting with those of the Chu capital at Ying.

== Linguistic influences ==
Although bronze inscriptions from the ancient state of Chu show little linguistic differences from the &quot;Elegant Speech&quot; (yǎyán 雅言) during the Eastern Zhou period, the variety of Old Chinese spoken in Chu has long been assumed to reflect lexical borrowings and syntactical interferences from non-Sinitic substrates, which the Chu may have acquired as a result of its southern migration into what Tian Jizhou believed to be a Kra–Dai or (para-) Hmong–Mien area in southern China. Recent excavated texts, corroborated by dialect words recorded in the &quot;Fangyan&quot;, further demonstrated substrate influences, but there are competing hypotheses on their genealogical affiliation.
* Aberrant early Chinese dialect, originally from the North
* Austroasiatic (Norman &amp; Mei 1976, Boltz 1999)
* Hmong–Mien (Erkes 1930, Long &amp; Ma 1983, Brooks 2001, Sagart et al. 2005)
* Kra–Dai (Liu Xingge 1988, Zhengzhang Shangfang 2005)
* Tibeto-Burman (Zhang Yongyan 1992, Zhou Jixu 2001)
* Mixture of Austroasiatic, Hmong-Mien and Tibeto-Burman (Pullyblank 1983, Schuessler 2004 &amp; 2007)
* Unknown
Noticing that both 荆 &quot;Jīng&quot; and 楚 &quot;Chǔ&quot; refer to the thorny chaste tree (genus Vitex), Schuessler (2007) proposes two Austroasiatic comparanda:
* 楚 &quot;Chǔ&quot; &lt; Old Chinese *&quot;tshraʔ&quot; is comparable to Proto-Monic *&quot;jrlaaʔ&quot; &quot;thorn, thorny bamboo (added to names of thorny plants)&quot;, Khmu /cǝrlaʔ/, Semai /jǝrlaaʔ/, all descending from Proto-Mon-Khmer *&quot;ɟlaʔ&quot; &quot;thorn&quot;;
* 荆 &quot;Jīng&quot; &lt; Old Chinese *&quot;kreŋ&quot; is comparable to Khmer ជ្រាំង &quot;crĕəng&quot; “to bristle” and ប្រែង &quot;praeng&quot; “bristle”, with Chinese initial *&quot;k-&quot; possibly being a noun-forming prefix.

== Bureaucracy ==

The Mo&#x27;ao () and the Lingyin () were the top government officials of Chu. Sima was the military commander of Chu&#x27;s army. Lingyin, Mo&#x27;ao and Sima were the San Gong () of Chu. In the Spring and Autumn period, Zuoyin () and Youyin () were added as the undersecretaries of Lingyin. Likewise, Sima () was assisted by Zuosima () and Yousima () respectively. Mo&#x27;ao&#x27;s status was gradually lowered while Lingyin and Sima became more powerful posts in the Chu court.

Ministers whose functions vary according to their titles were called Yin (). For example: Lingyin (Prime minister), Gongyin (Minister of works), and Zhenyin were all suffixed by the word &quot;Yin&quot;. Shenyin () was the minister of religious duties or the high priest of Chu, multiple entries in Zuo Zhuan indicated their role as oracles. Other Yins recorded by history were: Yuyin, Lianyin, Jiaoyin, Gongjiyin, Lingyin, Huanlie Zhi Yin (Commander of Palace guards) and Yueyin (Minister of Music). In counties and commanderies, Gong (), also known as Xianyin (minister of county) was the chief administrator.

In many cases, positions in Chu&#x27;s bureaucracy were hereditarily held by members of a cadet branch of Chu&#x27;s royal house of Mi. Mo&#x27;ao, one of the three chancellors of Chu, was exclusively chosen from Qu () clan. During the early spring and autumn period and before the Ruo&#x27;ao rebellion, Lingyin was a position held by Ruo&#x27;aos, namely Dou () and Cheng ().

== Geography ==
Progenitors of Chu such as viscount Xiong Yi were said to originate from the Jing Mountains; a chain of mountains located in today&#x27;s Hubei province. Rulers of Chu systematically migrated states annexed by Chu to the Jing mountains in order to control them more efficiently. East of Jing mountains are the Tu () mountains. In the north-east part of Chu are the Dabie mountains; the drainage divide of Huai river and Yangtse river. The first capital of Chu, Danyang () was located in today&#x27;s Zhijiang, Hubei province. Ying (), one of the later capitals of Chu, is known by its contemporary name Jingzhou. In Chu&#x27;s northern border lies the Fangcheng mountain. Strategically, Fangcheng is an ideal defense against states of central plain. Due to its strategic value, numerous castles were built on the Fangcheng mountain.

Yunmeng Ze in Jianghan Plain was an immense freshwater lake that historically existed in Chu&#x27;s realm, It was crossed by Yanzi river, the northern Yunmeng was named Meng (), the southern Yunmeng was known as Yun (). The lake&#x27;s body covers parts of today&#x27;s Zhijiang, Jianli, Shishou, Macheng, Huanggang, and Anlu.

Shaoxi Pass was an important outpost in the mountainous western border of Chu. It was located in today&#x27;s Wuguan town of Danfeng County, Shaanxi. Any forces that marched from the west, mainly from Qin, to Chu&#x27;s realm would have to pass Shaoxi.

==Astronomy==

In traditional Chinese astronomy, Chu is represented by a star in the &quot;Twelve States&quot; asterism, part of the &quot;Girl&quot; lunar mansion in the &quot;Black Turtle&quot; symbol.

It is also represented by the star Epsilon Ophiuchi in the &quot;Right Wall&quot; asterism in the &quot;Heavenly Market&quot; enclosure.

==Biology==
The virus taxa &quot;Chuviridae&quot; and &quot;Jingchuvirales&quot; are named after Chǔ.
