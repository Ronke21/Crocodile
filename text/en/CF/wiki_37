<text>Eugene Talmadge (September 23, 1884 – December 21, 1946) was an attorney and American politician who served three terms as the 67th governor of Georgia, from 1933 to 1937, and then again from 1941 to 1943. Elected to a fourth term in November 1946, he died before his inauguration, scheduled for January 1947. Only Talmadge and Joe Brown, in the mid-19th century, have been elected four times as governor of Georgia.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was known for promoting racial segregation and white supremacy, and for advocating for racism in the University System of Georgia.

==Early life, education and early career==
Eugene Talmadge was born on September 23, 1884, in Forsyth, Georgia, the second of two children to Thomas and Carrie (Roberts) Talmadge. He attended the University of Georgia and graduated from the university&#x27;s law school in 1907. While at UGA, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and Sigma Nu fraternity. In 1909, he married Mattie Thurmond Peterson and the couple had three children, including Herman Talmadge.

He started his legal career in Montgomery County where he also owned a farm. From 1918 to 1920, he started his political career as the solicitor for McRae, Georgia. He was the county attorney for Telfair County between 1920 and 1923. He joined the Democratic Party and twice ran for the Georgia state legislature, losing in 1920 and 1922.

===Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture===
He was elected as the Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture in 1926, defeating J. J. Brown. Talmadge was re-elected commissioner in 1928 and 1930. As commissioner, Talmadge used the newspaper of his department to give advice to farmers and promote his political views, extolling the virtues of a laissez-faire economic policy and individual action to improve the well-being of farmers. He maintained widespread support among Georgia&#x27;s rural white communities.

The State Senate concluded that Talmadge violated a state law requiring that fertilizer fees collected by the agriculture department be deposited in the state treasury. He was criticized for paying himself and family members more than $40,000 in salaries and expenses, and using department funds to make trips to the Kentucky Derby. Accused of &quot;stealing&quot; $20,000 in order to raise the price of hogs, Talmadge told one group of farmers, &quot;Sure, I stole it! But I stole it for you.&quot; The State House declined requests to impeach Talmadge but agreed to sue him to recover state funds spent on the hog price manipulation scheme. When Governor Richard B. Russell Jr. referred the suit to the state attorney general, however, the request to sue Talmadge was rejected.

==Governor==

In 1932, Governor Russell ran as a candidate for the United States Senate. Talmadge ran for governor, appealing to white rural Georgia by idealizing the small farmer, and preaching what he said were the true values of rural America, such as rugged individualism, frugality, governmental economy, segregation, limited government, and low taxes. Talmadge won a majority of the county unit votes and therefore the primary. Winning the nomination of the Democratic Party was tantamount to automatic victory in the general election. He was sworn in on January 10, 1933.
Because all counties were given equal weight, the County Unit System gave outsized power to the rural counties, which were Talmadge&#x27;s base. He boasted, &quot;I can carry any county that ain&#x27;t got street cars.&quot; He made twelve campaign promises, the most controversial of which was to lower the price of an automobile license to $3, putting them within reach of the poorest farmers. The state legislature intensely debated the $3 license fee issue, but did not pass it. After it adjourned, Talmadge fixed the $3 fee by proclamation.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt developed the New Deal with programs to hire unemployed men to work on various public works projects. These were often for needed infrastructure identified by the states. In the South, these jobs offered higher wages than men could obtain in the private sector, and black men were paid the same rate as white men. Many of the wealthy white land-owning families in Georgia soon complained to Talmadge that their sharecroppers preferred to work on the better-paying New Deal public works projects rather than as sharecroppers, and asked the governor to intercede with the president.

In 1933, one sharecropper wrote to Talmadge: &quot;I wound&#x27;t [wouldn&#x27;t] plow nobody&#x27;s mule from sunrise to sunset for 50 cents a day when I could get $1.30 for pretending to work on a DITCH&quot;. A disgusted Talmadge forwarded the letter to Roosevelt, together with his own letter that stated: &quot;I take it that you approve of paying farm labor 40 to 50 cents per day&quot;. Roosevelt wrote back: &quot;Somehow I cannot get into my head that wages on such a scale make possible a reasonable American standard of living&quot;.

For all his populism and his self-image as the defender of the small white farmers of Georgia, Talmadge tended to side with the interests of the wealthier land-owning families of the state. He was strongly opposed to Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts to raise wages in the South, believing that this would undercut the South&#x27;s only economic advantage, namely of having the lowest wages in the United States. Roosevelt by contrast believed that raising wages would increase consumption and hence spur the economy out of the Great Depression.

When Georgia textile workers went on strike on September 1, 1934, Talmadge declared martial law during the third week of the strike. He directed four thousand National Guard troops to arrest all picketers throughout the state. He ordered the prisoners to be held behind the barbed wire of a former World War I prisoner of war camp for trial by a military tribunal. While the state interned about one hundred or so picketers, the show of force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state. When Talmadge discovered that one of the employers had hired the notorious strikebreaker Pearl Bergoff, he had Bergoff and his two hundred men detained by the Georgia National Guard and deported to New York City.

Although often tied to both controversy and corruption, Talmadge was re-elected in 1934, carrying every county but three in the state&#x27;s Democratic primary. When the Public Service Commission, a body elected by the voters, refused to lower utility rates, he appointed a new board to get it done. When the Highway Board resisted his efforts to control it, Talmadge declared martial law and appointed more cooperative members to the board. When the state treasurer and comptroller general refused to cooperate, the governor ordered state police to remove them physically from their offices in the state capitol. Critics denounced him as a dictator, a demagogue, and a threat to the tranquility of the state. His supporters considered him to be a friend of the &quot;common man&quot; and one of the state&#x27;s most outstanding governors.

In October 1934, Talmadge ousted John S. Cohen, the pro-New Deal chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, and replaced him with Hugh Howell, a Talmadge partisan. Roosevelt met with Talmadge to ask him to save Cohen&#x27;s job, a request that was refused, leading the president to suspect that this was the first step by Talmadge toward a possible presidential run in 1936. By late 1934, Talmadge&#x27;s relationship with Roosevelt was fraying. In December 1934, when Roosevelt decided to spend Christmas at Warm Springs, Georgia, Talmadge sent a note requesting a private meeting with the president. His staff responded by a note apologizing for Roosevelt not having the time to see the governor, and vaguely promising him a private meeting at the White House sometime in 1935.

By early 1935, Talmadge was working on an alliance with US Senator Huey Long (D-Louisiana), who was planning on running against Roosevelt in 1936. When asked what was discussed at his meetings with Long, Talmadge replied: &quot;We both cussed Roosevelt&quot;. But, Long had a low opinion of Talmadge&#x27;s intelligence, saying: &quot;That Talmadge ain&#x27;t got the brains to match his ambition&quot;. Beyond a shared antipathy to Roosevelt, the two had almost nothing in common politically. Long, a left-wing populist, had the slogan of &quot;share the wealth&quot;, promising if elected president he would confiscate all the wealth of the richest Americans and redistribute it to the poor, whereas Talmadge was essentially an old-fashioned Southern conservative. Long criticized Roosevelt for not going far enough with the New Deal, while Talmadge had felt he had gone too far. Finally, both men wanted to run for president and wanted the other to serve as vice president, which proved to be the issue that ended their alliance and made them enemies.

Talmadge governed as a Southern conservative, vehemently attacking the nationalization of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. He objected to policies favorable to black people, the farm programs, and relief-work programs such as the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps. Talmadge believed the New Deal relief programs were encouraging people to be lazy, telling a reporter: &quot;The way to handle a relief program was like how Mussolini was handling it in Italy, namely to line these people up and take the troops and make them work&quot;.

Talmadge tried to build a region-wide coalition, making a national speaking tour in preparation for a challenge to FDR in 1936. Talmadge&#x27;s main allies were the Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, who had been the principal organizer of Long&#x27;s Share Our Wealth Clubs; John Henry Kirby, a wealthy Texas businessman who had been a leading Long supporter; and novelist Thomas Dixon Jr., a white supremacist whose books glorifying the Ku Klux Klan were very popular at the time. Talmadge&#x27;s bid was being financed with some $41,000 contributed by Alfred Sloan, CEO of General Motors, together with money from the Raskob and du Pont families.

His Southern Committee to Uphold the Constitution organized a convention in Macon, Georgia, in January 1936 that brought together fragments of the old Huey P. Long coalition. The Macon convention turned out to be a media disaster that ended Talmadge&#x27;s presidential hopes. The populist platform that Talmadge drafted at his Macon convention, with its call for more silver to be mined to support the silver standard, more protectionism, more states rights, more isolationism, and less immigration was widely mocked as more appropriate for the 19th century than the 20th.

Talmadge pledged to defend the &quot;sovereignty of our states and local self-government&quot; at the upcoming Democratic National Convention. However, Roosevelt, who visited Warm Springs, Georgia, often because of his past polio, was more popular with the poor farmers. Unable to run for re-election in 1936, Talmadge chose to challenge Senator Russell in the primary, but Russell defeated Talmadge by a landslide and Talmadge&#x27;s presidential hopes collapsed. Talmadge&#x27;s handpicked candidate for governor, Charles Redwine, lost the 1936 Georgia gubernatorial election to pro-New Deal Democrat Eurith D. Rivers by an overwhelming margin.

In 1936, according to a United Press (UP) article printed in the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; on August 21, 1936, titled &quot;Gene Selects Hitler as Favorite &#x27;Author&#x27;&quot;, Talmadge reportedly told a Los Angeles newspaper that while he didn&#x27;t have time to read many books, he read Adolf Hitler&#x27;s book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (&quot;My Struggle&quot;) seven times. The Nazi publication &quot;Die Bewegung&quot; reprinted the interview with Talmadge and praised him, stating that &quot;Governor Eugene Talmadge, of Georgia, is obviously a very intelligent man.&quot;

In 1938, Talmadge challenged incumbent U.S. senator Walter F. George. Though George had sided with 34 of Roosevelt&#x27;s 44 New Deal proposals, he refused to support some of the proposals in Roosevelt&#x27;s second term. The president believed George had been &quot;put out to pasture&quot;. Roosevelt tried to purge George and campaigned for his own candidate, Lawrence Camp. George, however, refused to criticize Roosevelt during the campaign and blamed the purge on Roosevelt&#x27;s advisers. Despite the divide among the New Deal vote, George easily won renomination, securing 141,922 popular votes and a majority of 246 county unit votes, while Talmadge won just 102,464 popular votes and 148 unit votes. Talmadge&#x27;s margin over Roosevelt&#x27;s candidate Camp, who secured just 78,223 popular votes and 16 unit votes, surprised his critics.

==University of Georgia==

Talmadge was elected again as governor in 1940 and returned to the governor&#x27;s office in 1941, emerging as the leader of racist and segregationist elements in Georgia. Responding to reports that Walter Cocking, a dean at the University of Georgia, had advocated bringing black and white students together in the classroom, Talmadge launched an attack on the university, charging elitism, and called for the regents to remove Cocking and purge the university of communists, &quot;foreigners&quot; (non-Georgians), and subscribers to racial equality. The university board of regents at first refused Talmadge&#x27;s demands, but after the governor restructured the board, the university dismissed numerous staff.

This intervention into academic affairs caused the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to remove accreditation from the Georgia state universities. It also contributed to Talmadge&#x27;s defeat by Ellis Arnall in 1942.

In 1940–1941, Talmadge took a strongly isolationist line and was opposed to Roosevelt&#x27;s policy of having America be the &quot;arsenal of democracy&quot;. He said that money spent in aiding Britain, China and the Soviet Union would have been better spent on helping the poor farmers of Georgia. The fact that Talmadge had an admiration for Hitler and voiced such strong support for Japan&#x27;s war against China that the Japanese government invited him to visit Japan on all-expenses paid vacation (an offer he declined) led to allegations that he was an Axis-sympathizer. Some commentators felt that Talmadge was merely naive, a man who knew nothing about the affairs of Europe and Asia, while others charged that his authoritarian style of leadership made him naturally sympathetic towards fascist regimes. About the charge that he acted like a dictator, Talmadge replied: &quot;I&#x27;m what you call a minor dictator. But did you ever see anybody that was much good who didn&#x27;t have a little dictator in him?&quot; Talmadge&#x27;s biographer, William Anderson, wrote that Talmadge&#x27;s admiration for Nazi Germany, his tendency to surround himself with paramilitary followers, and his frequent calls for martial law gave &quot;an eerie backing&quot; for his words.

At the same time, the Cocking Affair had badly damaged Talmadge&#x27;s reputation. Arnall was a supporter of segregation, whose views on race were essentially the same as Talmadge&#x27;s, but he presented himself as a supporter of better education for Georgians. Arnall noted that nobody could beat Talmadge in what he cynically called the &quot;nigger-hating contest&quot;, and argued that the issue in the &quot;Cocking Affair&quot; was not white supremacy, as Talmadge claimed, but education. Arnall charged that Georgia&#x27;s universities losing their accreditation, which Talmadge presented as an achievement on his part, put at risk the futures of all the students attending the universities. At a time when most Georgians were living in poverty and few attended higher education, the possibility that those young people who were lucky enough to attend university or might be would lose their chances to escape lives of poverty was widely regarded as unacceptable. Those Georgians whose children were attending the university were outraged that the futures of their children had been at risk, and those whose children were not attending university had hopes that someday they might.

The students at Georgia&#x27;s universities and colleges campaigned vigorously against Talmadge, putting on skits that mocked the governor as a power-crazed buffoon just before football games. They were disproportionately over-represented as volunteers in the Arnall campaign. When Talmadge held campaign rallies, students showed up to chant &quot;To Hell with Talmadge!&quot; At one Talmadge campaign rally on July 2, 1942, a Talmadge supporter threw a canister of tear gas at the students, an incident that attracted much negative comment and led to demands that Talmadge discipline his &quot;hoodlums&quot; who always patrolled his rallies. Talmadge was so unpopular with students that his campaign workers in the university town of Athens urged him not to hold a campaign rally there, predicting that more people would come out to boo him than cheer him.

Realizing that Arnall had cast himself as stronger on the education issue, Talmadge changed tactics and announced simply that the loss of accreditation to Georgia&#x27;s universities did not matter, saying at one rally in a rural area: &quot;They talk about education. It ain&#x27;t never taught a man how to plant cotton. It ain&#x27;t made a garden bloom. It ain&#x27;t never taught the experience necessary to raise cows and chickens. You gotta git out and do them things, and no school education is going to help ya&quot;. This message was intended to appeal to the white farmers who traditionally supported Talmadge, but may have inadvertently hurt him as even many of Talmadge&#x27;s rural supporters knew that a better education represented their children&#x27;s best hope of escaping poverty, and did not appreciate the implied message that the best thing that could happen to their children would be to follow their parents in lives of drudgery and poverty.

As was always the case, Talmadge presented himself as an aggressive defender of white supremacy, arguing that keeping the black people disfranchised and segregated was far more important than education, a message that appealed to his core supporters, but to nobody else. At one campaign rally, Talmadge stated: &quot;We in the South love the Negro in his place-but his place is at the back door&quot;. The fact that Arnall had also declared himself a supporter of segregation, albeit not in quite the same crude terms as Talmadge had, meant that for many white Georgians there was no difference between the candidates on &quot;the Negro question&quot;, and therefore neutralized Talmadge&#x27;s advantage as a defender of white supremacy. Furthermore, men were more likely to vote for Talmadge than women, and in 1942, many Georgian men were serving in the military, thus leading to women being over-represented in the Democratic primary. In the primary, Arnall won 174,575 votes to Talmadge&#x27;s 128,394. Even the &quot;county unit system&quot;, which worked to Talmadge&#x27;s advantage in the past, failed to save him in 1942. Arnall won 242 unit votes to Talmadge&#x27;s 149.

==In retirement==
Just after Talmadge left office in January 1943, it emerged that since 1940 he had been receiving food grown on the state prison farms for free, an allegation that he admitted to, saying he was saving the state of Georgia money by not paying for his food. Shortly afterwards, it emerged that he attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, which he again admitted to, saying that &quot;everyone had a good time&quot; at the Klan banquet. In his retirement, Talmadge grew increasingly bitter and became consumed with a violent hatred for Roosevelt. The isolationist Talmadge also deplored the United States fighting in World War II, all the more so as the social changes caused by the war were threatening Talmadge&#x27;s vision of what an ideal America should be. In particular, the first tentative gains made by the Civil rights movement in the war years enraged Talmadge, who predicated that even the modest gains being made by black Americans during the war would eventually lead to the end of white supremacy in the South.

Talmadge convinced himself that Roosevelt had deliberately engineered the United States&#x27;s entry into World War II because he wanted to create the social changes that would end white supremacy, causing him to engage in long tirades against Roosevelt, the New Deal, World War II and black Americans. Talmadge&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Statesman&quot; printed editorials written by himself claiming that Roosevelt was compromising American sovereignty, making the allegation that the British prime minister Winston Churchill was being allowed to &quot;meddle&quot; in the affairs of Congress with Roosevelt&#x27;s support. In the 1944 election, &quot;The Statesman&quot; ran a headline reading &quot;Election of Roosevelt Means Promoting Negroes in Georgia&quot;. Anderson wrote during the war Talmadge became a &quot;total cultural isolationist&quot;, a man who saw the world outside of the United States as a dangerous, menacing place and believed increasing American involvement with the world beyond would destroy everything that he held sacred. At the same time, Talmadge, always a heavy drinker, started to drink on a scale that began to seriously damage his health.

Anderson described Talmadge as &quot;a ghost&#x27;s voice hellbent on halting the future. But it was a frightened voice, scared that the wave of history had at last washed over the impenetrable culture of his fathers. So easily had his people succumbed to the siren call of change that Gene found himself with one hoary root left, one last undeniable link to yesterday-the black. He alone anchored the old consciousness, the tenacious culture, the old consciousness. Gene Talmadge knew if this one tie was uprooted, his world would be gone forever.&quot; When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1944 &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; decision that white-only primaries were illegal and ordered Southern states to hold color-blind primaries, Talmadge was enraged; his attempted political comeback was based entirely on a virulently racist platform of upholding white supremacy.

==Last election==
During Arnall&#x27;s term, the state legislature lengthened his term to four years and prohibited him from seeking re-election in 1946. Talmadge ran for governor and used the &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; decision, ruling that the closed white primary was unconstitutional, as his main red flag issue. Talmadge promised that if he were to be elected, he would restore the &quot;Equal Primary&quot;. Talmadge&#x27;s family and advisers sought to persuade him not to run, warning that due to his failing health that a grueling campaign might kill him, but he refused to step aside in favor of his son Herman who had been groomed as his heir, saying &quot;Naw, I&#x27;m the only goddamn son of a bitch who can win&quot;. Talmadge&#x27;s campaign was noted for its violent racist rhetoric as he boasted about assaulting and flogging the black sharecroppers who worked for his family as a young man and he claimed to have chased a black man down the street with an ax because he sat next to a white woman. His 1946 campaign is described by historians as explicitly white supremacist.

In June 2007, previously sealed FBI files revealed that Talmadge was investigated by the FBI over suspicions he sanctioned the Moore&#x27;s Ford lynching. Though Talmadge was unpopular in the more populous urban areas, his relative popularity in rural areas gave him a fighting chance of still winning the Democratic nomination under the &quot;county unit votes&quot; system in which (essentially) the candidate who won the most counties, not the most popular votes, would receive the nomination. Even then, Talmadge&#x27;s opponent, James V. Carmichael, still polled well in rural counties, though not as well as in urban counties. Several witnesses stated that they overheard Talmadge speaking to George Hester, the brother of a white man stabbed by a black man named Roger Malcolm, outside of the courthouse in Monroe, Georgia, promising he would &quot;take care of the Negro&quot; in exchange for the Hester family using their influence to help win Walton County. On July 25, 1946, the car carrying Malcolm, who had been bailed out of jail, was stopped by a group of about 30 white men at Moore&#x27;s Ford. Malcolm, his wife Dorothy, and the other black couple riding in the car, George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were marched out of the car, lined up and shot. The FBI agent investigating the lynching called the allegation that Talmadge led the lynch mob &quot;unbelievable&quot;, but he forwarded the allegation to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover &quot;as it may be of some possible future interest.&quot; Talmadge&#x27;s grandson, Herman Talmadge Jr, told the press: &quot;I don&#x27;t think my grandfather&#x27;s involved in any lynching. If y&#x27;all are that far off, I feel sorry for you.&quot; About the allegations that it was Talmadge who led the lynch mob at Moore&#x27;s Ford, the historian Robert Pratt stated: &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised ... historians over the years have concluded the violently racist tone of his 1946 campaign may have been indirectly responsible for the violence that came at Moore&#x27;s Ford. It&#x27;s fair to say he&#x27;s one of the most virulently racist governors the state has ever had.&quot; In 1946, Talmadge won Walton County by only 200 votes.

Talmadge lost the popular vote in the 1946 Democratic primary to James V. Carmichael but won a majority of the &quot;county unit votes&quot;. He died in December, before he could be sworn in for his fourth term. The cause of death was hepatitis complicated with the effects of liver cirrhosis caused by his heavy drinking. Talmadge&#x27;s coffin, while lying in state at the Georgia capital, was decorated with a wreath reading KKKK (Knights of the Ku Klux Klan), an organization that Talmadge had at least been friendly with. His death right before his inauguration precipitated the 1947 &quot;three governors controversy&quot; among Arnall, newly elected lieutenant governor Melvin E. Thompson, and Talmadge&#x27;s son, Herman Talmadge. While the General Assembly elected Herman Talmadge to take his father&#x27;s place, Thompson claimed his right to succeed to the governorship, and also Arnall refused to leave office. Following a decision by the Supreme Court of Georgia, Herman Talmadge ceded the office of governor to Thompson, ending the controversy—which had damaged Georgia&#x27;s national reputation.

==Awards and legacy==

* In 1941, Talmadge received an honorary degree in Doctor of Laws from Oglethorpe University.
* In 1949, a statue honoring Talmadge was unveiled on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol.
* The Talmadge Memorial Bridge (1953/1991) in Savannah, Georgia, is named after him. It connects downtown Savannah, Georgia with the Carolina Low Country via the Savannah River. In the early 21st century, renaming of the bridge has been suggested because of Talmadge&#x27;s history as a white supremacist.

===Representation in popular culture===
* The &quot;Cocking affair&quot; was the subject of Michael Braz&#x27;s opera, &quot;A Scholar Under Siege&quot;, composed for the centenary of Georgia Southern University and premiered in 2007.

<text>The Colour of My Love is the twelfth studio album and third English-language album by Canadian singer Celine Dion. It was released by Sony Music on 9 November 1993. The songs were produced mainly by David Foster, Ric Wake, Walter Afanasieff, Christopher Neil, and Guy Roche, and four of them were written by Diane Warren. The album features cover versions of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;.

After its release, &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; received generally mixed reviews from music critics but became a huge commercial success, topping the charts in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and a few other European countries and reaching the top ten elsewhere, including number four in the United States. &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; remains one of the best-selling albums of all time, with sales of over 20 million copies worldwide, including six million units in the United States, over 1.8 million copies in the United Kingdom, 1.5 million in Canada and over one million units in Japan. Singles released from the album include the US number one &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, the UK number one &quot;Think Twice&quot;, and the Japanese chart topper &quot;To Love You More&quot;, which was included on the 1995 re-release of &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; in Japan. Each of these singles sold over one million copies in these countries.

&quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; won two Juno Awards for Album of the Year and Best Selling Album (Foreign or Domestic), and also received the IRMA Award for Best International Female Artist Album. &quot;Think Twice&quot; won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically and &quot;To Love You More&quot; received the International Single Grand Prix at the Japan Gold Disc Award. &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s) and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1994. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1995.

==Background and release==
After releasing two English-language studio albums, &quot;Unison&quot; (1990) and &quot;Celine Dion&quot; (1992), recording Academy Award and Grammy Award-winning song, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and achieving three top ten entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (&quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot;), Dion started working on her third English-language album, entitled &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;. In September 1993, she performed two concerts at the Capitole de Québec in Quebec City, Canada, which were recorded to be later broadcast on television. Dion performed brand new, unheard songs from the upcoming album &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;, including: &quot;Refuse to Dance&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27; My Baby Down&quot;, &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, &quot;Misled&quot;, &quot;Think Twice&quot; and &quot;Only One Road&quot;. The show entitled later &quot;The Colour of My Love Concert&quot; was issued as a home video in 1995. &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; was released in November 1993 in North America, December 1993 in Japan, February 1994 in Europe and in March 1994 in Australia.

In the album&#x27;s liner notes, Dion for the first time publicly revealed her relationship with her manager, René Angélil. During the album&#x27;s launch event at Montreal&#x27;s Metropolis, she announced they are engaged to be married.

==Content==
&quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; was released with fourteen songs in the United States and fifteen tracks, including &quot;Just Walk Away&quot;, elsewhere. The album was produced mainly by David Foster, Ric Wake, Guy Roche, Walter Afanasieff and Christopher Neil. Diane Warren wrote four songs for &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;, including: &quot;Next Plane Out&quot;, &quot;Real Emotion&quot;, &quot;No Living Without Loving You&quot; and &quot;Lovin&#x27; Proof&quot;. The album features a duet with Clive Griffin on &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, taken from the &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; soundtrack and a cover version of Jennifer Rush&#x27;s 1984 track, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. In October 1995, &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; was re-released in Japan, including new song, &quot;To Love You More&quot;, written and produced by David Foster.

==Singles==
After &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, which originally appeared on the &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; soundtrack, &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was issued as the first proper single from &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;. The song was very successful, reaching number one in the United States, Canada and Australia, and peaking inside top ten in various countries, including the United Kingdom and France. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; has sold over 1.1 million copies in the United States and was certified Platinum in 1994. The next song, &quot;Misled&quot;, became a top ten single in Canada and also reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States. Another success came with the release of &quot;Think Twice&quot;, a single which topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, and reached top ten in Australia, Spain and Switzerland. &quot;Think Twice&quot; has sold over 1.3 million copies in the United Kingdom and was certified Platinum in 1995 (eligible for two-times Platinum). The next single, &quot;Only One Road&quot; peaked inside the top ten in the United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland. In 1995, &quot;Next Plane Out&quot; was released in Australia and &quot;Just Walk Away&quot; was issued as a promotional single in Spain. In October 1995, &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; was re-released in Japan, including new song, &quot;To Love You More&quot;, which was released as a single at the same time. &quot;To Love You More&quot; reached number one on the Oricon Singles Chart and has sold 1.5 million copies in Japan. It was certified Million by the RIAJ.

==Promotion==
Dion promoted &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; in North America on various television programmes in late 1993 and early 1994. Additionally, her &quot;The Colour of My Love Concert&quot; aired in December 1993 in Canada and in February 1994 in the United States. Dion also embarked on The Colour of My Love Tour and performed concerts in the United States in February 1994, and in Canada through May 1994. After the success of &quot;Think Twice&quot; outside North America, she also started promoting the album in 1995 in Europe, including the United Kingdom. Performances, after releasing the album include: &quot;The Power of Love&quot; at the Juno Awards of 1994 and American Music Awards of 1995, &quot;Think Twice&quot; at the Edison Awards in 1994 and World Music Awards in 1995, and &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; at the Juno Awards of 1995. Dion also performed three songs from &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the United Kingdom: &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (1994), &quot;Think Twice&quot; (1995) and &quot;Only One Road&quot; (1995).

==Critical reception==

Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, with positive attention given to Dion&#x27;s vocals. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it three out of five stars and wrote that the album follows the same pattern as Dion&#x27;s eponymous breakthrough, and while the songs are not quite as consistent this time around, the record is nevertheless quite successful, thanks to the careful production, professional songwriting (highlighted by &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, and &quot;Think Twice&quot;) and Dion&#x27;s powerhouse performances. Brad Webber from &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the album two out of four stars. He felt that &quot;sickly sweet, by-the-books standards&quot; like &quot;The Power of Love&quot; belie Dion&#x27;s talent: &quot;forcefully resonant and multiflavored vocals&quot;. He criticized &quot;crooked roots&quot; of a Janet Jackson impersonation (&quot;Misled&quot; and &quot;Think Twice&quot;), formulaic duo ballad (&quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;) and added that with Dion&#x27;s attempt at soul, you can categorize her as &quot;fairly shallow, sort of a female Michael Bolton&quot;. However Webber praised an &quot;exotic thrill&quot; in &quot;Refuse to Dance&quot;, which &quot;throws a little variety in the mix&quot;. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; is a &quot;big-league affair&quot; that should push Dion to &quot;new realms of pop stardom&quot;. Dion is more mature and shows off her vocal prowess on probable smashes as &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, &quot;Misled&quot; and &quot;Only One Road&quot;. According to Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot;, although &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; is full of the &quot;grand pop balladry&quot;, it also has more rhythmic depth than Dion&#x27;s previous projects, including jack-swinging &quot;Misled&quot; and the &quot;haunting but spine-crawling&quot; &quot;Refuse to Dance&quot;. 

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; remains one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums of all time. It was the second top-selling album of 1994 in Canada, third top-selling album of 1994 by a female artist in the United States, third top-selling album of 1995 in the UK and has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, becoming the twentieth best-selling album by a woman in history.

It became the second best-selling album of the year 1994 in Canada, after Ace of Base&#x27;s &quot;The Sign&quot;.

<text>The 1965 [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL entry draft|amateur draft]] was the 3rd NHL entry draft. It was a draft to assign unaffiliated amateur junior-age players to NHL teams. It was held on April 27, 1965, at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec.

For the first time the eligibility rules were changed for the 1965 draft. The minimum age criterion was increased, to 18 from 16 years. Clubs were not permitted to begin negotiations with the selected players until they reached 19 years of age, and the date from which they were ineligible due to being on club sponsorship lists was pushed back from May 23 to April 1.

The NHL also reached an agreement with the AHL, CHL and WHL, allowing their clubs to participate in the draft. After the NHL clubs made their selections the clubs from the other three leagues were permitted to make their own selections. Each AHL and WHL club was allowed three picks, while each CHL team was allowed two.

The general consensus on the part of each participatory club was that the talent pool from which to draft was exceptionally poor. The majority of amateur players falling within the new age rules had already been sponsored, if not turned professional. 11 picks were made, which to this date remains the lowest ever in an NHL draft. Only two players played in the NHL: Pierre Bouchard and Michel Parizeau.

The pool of available player talent was considered so poor that the Toronto Maple Leafs elected not to participate whatsoever. The only non-NHL club to exercise their right to make a selection was the Pittsburgh Hornets of the AHL, who picked Junior C player Gary Beattie with the 11th, final pick.

<text>Edward Kitchener &quot;&#x27;Ted&quot; Trotter, better known as Grandad, (1905–1985) is a fictional character who was one of the original leads of the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. He appeared in the show&#x27;s first three series, played by Lennard Pearce. The character is grandfather to Del Boy and Rodney Trotter. Pearce&#x27;s death in December 1984 was written into the series with the death of Grandad. His place was taken by Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield).

The character was portrayed by Phil Daniels in the prequel series &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;.

==Backstory==
Grandad was born in 1905 in Peckham, to Jack Trotter and Victoria Trotter. He had three brothers, George, Jack, and Albert. Grandad stated that his earliest memories were of watching soldiers marching off to World War I and witnessing their return after the Armistice in 1918. He later spoke of the horror of these experiences with his description of the wartime government policy (&quot;They promised us homes fit for heroes, they gave us heroes fit for homes!&quot;). His brother George served and was at the Battle of Passchendaele. After leaving school, Grandad got a job as a decorator working for the council but was sacked after just two days for wallpapering over a serving hatch. Around this time, he married his wife Violet, and they had a son, Reg in 1924 (who was actually born in Bermondsey).

He then began working as a lamplighter for the London Gas Light and Coke Company, but according to Del, as electricity had already been discovered, this job did not last long. He also trained as a chef at the Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital. He also worked as a security officer at a warehouse in Kilburn, which he was sacked from after a janitor stole over 300 briefcases from under his nose. As such, he was unemployed and impoverished. Fed up with this, he and his friend Nobby Clarke ran away to Tangier to join the French Foreign Legion; however, they were unsuccessful and became gun runners during the Spanish Civil War. They were caught by the authorities. Nobby was tortured but Grandad chose to confess everything under interrogation. Both were deported from Spain and all her territories and dominions. Grandad returned to Peckham and joined the dole queues. During the Trotter&#x27;s holiday to Spain in 1982, he was arrested and believed it was related to this, but it turned out he had been caught jaywalking.

During World War II, Grandad evidently served some time in the army, as he told Del he was given a double-headed coin by a fellow soldier, and his son Reg checked his blood group on his old army records, as mentioned in &quot;Thicker than Water.&quot; During the episode &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Uncle,&quot; Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield) shows Del a photograph of Grandad during the war. When Del asks why Grandad is wearing a vest and plimsolls, Albert answers &quot;Well, he&#x27;d just deserted&quot;. It was most likely at this time that he had an affair with Trigger&#x27;s grandmother Alice, while her husband Arthur was still fighting. According to Del&#x27;s autobiography, he got caught after deserting but was let off after pleading not guilty on the terms of temporary insanity.

After the war, Grandad had various short-term jobs before he retired &quot;at the ripe old age of forty-eight&quot;. His wife, who apparently worked as a charlady in these later years, died in the early 1960s, when Rodney was still young.

It is revealed in &quot;Tea for Three&quot; by Grandad&#x27;s younger brother Albert, that he and Albert fell out over Albert&#x27;s later wife, Ada. Albert tells Rodney that while walking home from a nightclub together, he and Grandad had a fight, and never spoke to each other again after that. Despite this, in the episode &quot;Miami Twice&quot;, Albert mentions that he married Ada &quot;before&quot; enlisting to fight in World War II, and &quot;after&quot; the war, as revealed in &quot;Hole in One&quot;, he and Grandad would often pull schemes on local pubs by having Albert fall down cellars without hurting himself and claiming compensation whenever they were short of money. Albert also mentions that during their youth, Grandad often looked after him, and it was for this reason that Albert regretted their falling out, attended Grandad&#x27;s funeral, and even tried to swindle the brewery in order to raise money to pay for Grandad&#x27;s gravestone.

==In the programme==
The character of Grandad was written out of the original show following the death of the actor Lennard Pearce but is a main character (frequently addressed as &quot;Ted&quot;) in the 2010-2011 prequel series &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. Set in 1960, Grandad has separated from his wife Vi after being kicked out of his flat in Deptford, and is unemployed and subsequently homeless after she finds out about his affair with Alice Ball. Grandad then moves in with his son Reg. The Trotters are at that time squeezed into a two-up two-down terraced house and Grandad is forced to share a bedroom with his grandson Del. He appears to enjoy a close relationship with his family and remains with them when they move to their new council flat in Nelson Mandela House (which was then known as the &quot;Sir Walter Raleigh House&quot;).

Grandad is seen in the first series of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. He is, by this point in his mid-seventies, largely infirm, and still living at Nelson Mandela House with his grandsons. He is often seen watching two television sets at once, one in black and white and one in colour. In The Second Time Around it is revealed that he would normally watch three sets, but one was being mended. Grandad&#x27;s favourite television shows are &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, as revealed in &quot;Homesick&quot; and &quot;May The Force Be With You,&quot; and the former episode reveals that he also enjoys listening to &quot;The Archers&quot; on the radio. In &quot;Yesterday Never Comes,&quot; Del suggests that he watches &quot;The Chinese Detective&quot; in his bedroom in order to remove him from the sitting room.

Grandad is always seen wearing a hat, even in bed.

Because of their sense of family loyalty, the Trotters ensure that he will always have a home, with Del dismissing his fiancée Pauline&#x27;s suggestion of putting Grandad into a residential home because &quot;he&#x27;s family&quot; (&quot;The Second Time Around&quot;). Grandad is a poor cook; his final line in the series is &quot;Del Boy, I&#x27;ve burnt yer pizza!&quot;, and in the first Christmas special, he left the giblets in their plastic wrapping inside the turkey. In the first episode, when Rodney came home after a week&#x27;s absence, he declined a meal cooked by Grandad despite being ravenously hungry. Del also played an April Fool&#x27;s joke on Grandad, telling him that the pools had called to say that he had won £500,000. Grandad went to Soho and celebrated before remembering that he did not participate in the pools.

None of the main characters addresses Grandad by his name. Trigger addresses him as &#x27;Mr. Trotter&#x27; in Ashes to Ashes, and in &quot;Who&#x27;s a Pretty Boy?&quot;, even pet shop owner Louis greets him as &#x27;Grandad.&#x27; This is further seen in The Russians Are Coming, when the Trotters are stopped for speeding by police sergeant Eric, who again refers to him as &#x27;Grandad&#x27;. His name is not revealed until &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;.

When Lennard Pearce died in 1984, writer John Sullivan chose not to recast him but to write the character&#x27;s death into the series. A funeral was held for Grandad in &quot;Strained Relations&quot;, which saw the Trotter brothers trying to come to terms with the loss of a man who had been such an integral part of their lives. This episode also introduced Grandad&#x27;s younger brother Uncle Albert. It is also known that apart from Albert he had two other brothers, Jack, who was mentioned by Albert in &quot;A Royal Flush&quot;, and George, whom he mentioned had served in World War 1 in the episode &quot;The Russians Are Coming&quot;. George’s wife Pat/Patsy was also mentioned by Albert, as well as Del in his biography, &quot;He Who Dares&quot;.

<doc id="950745" wikidata="Q1486983" url="?curid=950745" title="John Christian Schultz">
<text>Sir John Christian Schultz (January 1, 1840 – April 13, 1896) was a Manitoba politician and businessman. He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1871 to 1882, a Senator from 1882 to 1888, and the fifth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1888 to 1895.

==Background==
Schultz was born in Amherstburg, Upper Canada (now Ontario). Despite being raised in a poor household, he saved enough money to study medicine at Queen&#x27;s College in Kingston (1858–60) and Victoria College in Cobourg (1860–61). He did not graduate from either institution, but nonetheless advertised himself as a &quot;Physician and Surgeon&quot; after moving to the Red River settlement later in 1861 (it is unknown if he purchased a degree, as was legal at the time). He also worked as a businessman and speculator in this area, and eventually owned a number of stores in the Red River colony&#x27;s business sector, including the general store which was the initial building at Portage and Main with his half-brother Henry McKenney.

Schultz also helped to establish a museum and Masonic Lodge in 1864 in the region. Arrested for improper business practices in 1868, his wife and supporters soon broke into the prison and released him. He continued to live and work in the area, in open defiance of the Council of Assiniboia.

==Newspaper publisher==
In 1859, Schultz convinced Patrick Gammie Laurie, a newspaper publisher in Canada West, to sell his &quot;Owen Sound Times&quot; to set up the first newspaper in the Red River settlement; Laurie abandoned the idea before arriving when he found out that William Buckingham and William Coldwell had established one already: the &quot;Nor&#x27;Wester&quot;. James Ross bought Buckingham&#x27;s share of the &quot;Nor&#x27;Wester&quot; in 1863 and sold it to Schultz in 1864; Schultz became full owner when he purchased Coldwell&#x27;s the following year.

Schultz was a major figure in the early, highly partisan publishing world of the Red River area, which was soon to become the province of Manitoba. Schultz used the &quot;Nor&#x27;Wester&quot; to promote ending the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s rule of the Red River area and open it to settlement. Following his arrest and jailbreak in 1868, the paper ran a version of his side of the story and a criticism of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s legal authority. He sold the &quot;Nor&#x27;Wester&quot; to Walter R. Brown in 1868, and Louis Riel confiscated it the following year.

==Red River Rebellion==

Schultz was initially on good terms with Red River&#x27;s francophone community, but his unscrupulous business practices soon made him unpopular with most established settlers, anglophone and francophone alike. By 1869, he had emerged as the leader of a small, ultra-loyalist organization known as the Canadian Party. This group promoted the annexation of Red River by the Canadian government, and encouraged new anglophone/Protestant immigration from Ontario. Schultz and his followers were actively engaged in land speculation, and were viewed with extreme suspicion by most of Red River&#x27;s Métis community.

During the Red River Rebellion of 1869–70, Schultz emerged as one of the leading opponents of Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government (which was supported by most of the area&#x27;s population). Schultz&#x27;s followers engaged in a number of military skirmishes with the Riel government. Schultz and a number of his followers were taken prisoner by Riel. Schultz managed to escape, and tried to organize a group to liberate the remaining prisoners, but was forced to leave the region in February 1870. He arrived in Toronto in April.

Schultz made several speeches against the Riel government during his time in Toronto, and played a significant role in swaying Protestant opinion against the Métis leader. He frequently referred to Thomas Scott (an Ontario Orangeman executed by the Riel government for &quot;treason&quot;) as a Protestant hero, and called upon Ontario&#x27;s Orangemen to avenge his death (both Schultz and Macdonald were also Orangemen, as were most of the Ontario militiamen).

Schultz returned to Red River (now renamed Manitoba) in September, after the Canadian government had taken the area with militia units from Ontario. These Ontario soldiers frequently engaged in violence against the Métis population; there can be little doubt that Schultz approved of and encouraged their actions.

==Provincial politics==
The newly established government of Manitoba sought conciliation among the province&#x27;s ethnic, religious and linguistic factions, and generally regarded Schultz as a disruptive force. Lieutenant Governor Adams George Archibald hated Schultz, and refused to consider him when constructing his first administration. In Manitoba&#x27;s first provincial election (December 30, 1870), Schultz&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Party&quot; was the only real opposition to the governing alliance. His followers won four seats (one of which was overturned on appeal), and were responsible for the death of at least one aboriginal government supporter. Schultz himself was defeated by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company spokesman Donald Smith in the riding of Winnipeg and St. John, 70 votes to 63. There was a riot among the Ontario militiamen when the result was announced.

The &quot;Canadian Party&quot; continued as a parliamentary force after this defeat. At one stage, Archibald warned Prime Minister John A. Macdonald that they were promoting the &quot;extermination&quot; of the Métis.

==Federal politics==
Manitoba elected its first representatives to the federal House of Commons in March 1871, and Schultz declared himself a candidate in the riding of Lisgar. He was &quot;a member of the expansionist Canada First movement.&quot; In a campaign marked by violence and intimidation, he defeated local government supporter Colin Inkster by 315 votes to 65.

Schultz&#x27;s political affiliations were ambiguous in this period. John A. Macdonald attempted to bring him into the Conservative ranks in 1871, almost certainly with the intent of neutralizing him. These efforts were unsuccessful, and by 1872 Schultz was apparently calling himself an Independent Liberal. He started another local paper, the &quot;Manitoba Liberal&quot;, before the year was over.

In the federal election of 1872, Schultz defeated his former ally Edward Hay, 273 votes to 128. He defeated Hay a second time in 1874, 285 votes to 216. He was also appointed to the Council of the Northwest Territories in 1872, and served on that board until its restructuring in 1876.

Notwithstanding Schultz&#x27;s past agitations against the Métis, he was actually a &quot;defender&quot; of aboriginal rights for most of his time in parliament. He sought better compensation for the aboriginal population covered under &quot;Treaty 3&quot;, and tried to protect the buffalo from being hunted to extinction. He also sought to provide the west&#x27;s Métis population with sufficient provisions for farming.

These positions may appear strikingly out of character of Schultz&#x27;s previous actions, but they can probably be explained by the reduced influence of Louis Riel in the Canadian west after 1875. Most English-speaking aboriginals in the region were opposed to Riel, as were a number of francophone Métis; these groups generally did not consider Schultz as an enemy, nor was he unfavourably disposed toward them. Schultz continued to be a leading opponent of Riel in the 1870s, supporting his expulsion from parliament in 1874 and his five-year banishment from Canada in 1875. (It may also be noted that Schultz stood to benefit financially from some of the policies which he advocated for western Canada&#x27;s native population.)

Schultz was re-elected by acclamation in the federal election of 1878, as John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Conservatives won a national victory. Schultz would thereafter identify himself as a Liberal-Conservative and a supporter of Macdonald. Manitoba&#x27;s population was by this time becoming dominated by Ontario immigrants (Riel&#x27;s followers having largely abandoned the area), and Schultz was no longer considered a dangerous outsider by the local power structure.

In 1882, Schultz was defeated by Arthur Wellington Ross (also a Conservative), 760 votes to 720. Schultz was in poor health by this time, and many believed that he had little time left to live. Perhaps out of sympathy, John A. Macdonald appointed him to the Senate on September 23, 1882.

Schultz&#x27;s health subsequently recovered, and he was able to function as an active member of the Senate. He supported prohibition, and continued to defend aboriginal rights against outside incursions.

==Lieutenant-Governor==
On July 1, 1888, he resigned his Senate seat to become the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba. He was instructed to keep the Macdonald government updated on developments in the province, and to attempt to influence the government of Thomas Greenway on matters involving Macdonald&#x27;s National Policy. He played little part in the Greenway government&#x27;s anti-bilingualism legislation (which resulted in the Manitoba Schools Question), though he dutifully signed it into law on March 1, 1890, following Macdonald&#x27;s orders. Schultz subsequently sought concessions for francophone schools.

==Late life and legacy==
Schultz stepped down as Lt. Governor in 1895. He traveled to Mexico in an attempt to improve his faltering health, but died there in 1896. Schultz&#x27;s remains were transported to Winnipeg by a special baggage car, draped in a black cloth on the Great Northern Railway. His remains were accompanied by his best friend Alfred Codd and his wife.

Schultz&#x27;s progress from political outsider to Lt. Governor reflects the changes which occurred in Manitoba from 1870 to 1888. Although his early demagoguery was moderated over time, it is unlikely that he could have assumed high office had it not been for the high movement of anglophone settlers from Ontario to Manitoba in the intervening years. In 1870, he was regarded as a nuisance; when he died, he was a respected citizen.

Outside politics Schultz, Henry Septimus Beddome, Curtis James Bird and others were the founders of the Medical Health Board of Manitoba which was incorporated in 1871 and became the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba in 1877. Schultz was actively interested in railway and telegraph development and in colonization.

<text>Carla Anderson Hills (born January 3, 1934) is an American lawyer and former government official. A member of the Republican Party, she previously served as the 5th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Gerald Ford from 1975 to 1977 and as the 10th United States Trade Representative under President George H. W. Bush from 1989 to 1993. Hills was the first woman to hold each of those posts, the third woman ever to serve in a presidential cabinet, and the first appointed to both cabinet and cabinet-rank positions. Hills is the earliest-serving living former U.S. Cabinet member.

==Early life, education, and family==
She was born in Los Angeles in 1934 to Carl H. Anderson (1891 - 1965) and Edith A. Hume (1898 - 1987). Her parents married in 1926. Anderson received her B.A. degree from Stanford University, after studying at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford. She earned her LL.B. degree from Yale Law School in 1958 and married Roderick M. Hills the same year.

She married Roderick M. Hills on September 27, 1958. Together they had four children: Laura H. Hills (b. 1961), Roderick M. Hills Jr. (b. 1964), Megan E. Hills (b. 1966) and Alison M. Hills (b. 1970).

==Career==
Hills was admitted to the California bar in 1959, and served as an Assistant United States Attorney in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1961. From 1962 to 1974, she and her husband were founding name partners at Munger, Tolles &amp; Hills (now Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson) in Los Angeles. In 1972, she was an adjunct professor at UCLA. An authority on federal practice and anti-trust law, Mrs. Hills wrote of &quot;Federal Civil Practice&quot; and &quot;Antitrust Advisor&quot;. She is a former president of the National Association of Women Lawyers.

Hills was a United States Assistant Attorney General heading the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice before being named as the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Elliot L. Richardson sought to appoint her as assistant U.S. Attorney General in 1973, but he resigned shortly thereafter during the Watergate scandal. The offer was renewed by his successor, William B. Saxbe, in 1974.

Hills&#x27;s lack of relevant experience was somewhat controversial during the hearings for her nomination to head the HUD Department in the Ford administration. While Secretary, she approved the demolition of the massive public housing project in Northwest St. Louis, Pruitt-Igoe, a decayed project. President Ford later commented in his autobiography, &quot;A Time to Heal,&quot; that Hills was an exceptionally effective advocate for HUD, often appealing the budgetary decisions of James Lynn, Ford&#x27;s OMB chief, to the President and winning most of the time. Hills was one of the candidates on Ford&#x27;s “short list” to replace U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, although Ford ultimately selected John Paul Stevens. 

From 1978 through 1989, Hills returned to private practice. In 1978, she and her husband founded the Washington DC branch of Latham &amp; Watkins under the name of Latham, Watkins &amp; Hills. She served as chairwoman of the board of trustees of the Urban Institute from 1983 through 1988.

===U.S. Trade Representative===
Hills served as U.S. Trade Representative in the George H. W. Bush administration from 1989 to 1993. She was under pressure to implement the 1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act to go after countries that were considered to be trading unfairly with the U.S. The New York Times called Section 301 of the Act her “crowbar”, which enabled the U.S. to impose tariffs as high as 100%. She initially went after Japan, Brazil and India, although the Bush administration later decided Japan had changed its ways.

An advocate of free trade, she was the primary U.S. negotiator of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 2000, Hills was awarded the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle (&quot;La Orden Mexicana del Aguila Azteca&quot;), which is the highest honor awarded to non-citizens by the Mexican government. In fact, it was the first time Mexican-Americans were awarded this award since November 12, 1990 when the union leader, Cesar Chavez, received it.

President George H.W. Bush&#x27;s administration&#x27;s priority was to hammer out the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in the Uruguay Round, where Hills was known as a strong negotiator. “Delegations from 97 countries [sought] ways to notch down everyone’s tariffs and remove other obstacles to trade.” “The 97 signatories to GATT account for two-thirds of the $3 trillion in merchandise traded each year. Since the original agreement in 1947, GATT has been altered six times...” but, “after the last GATT revision – the Tokyo Round, which started in 1976 – many American industries were outclassed by others”.

=== Post-government career ===
Since 1993, she has worked as a consultant and a public speaker through Hills &amp; Company International Consultants, which merged with Dentons Global Advisors ASG in 2022. Carla stepped down from Time Warner, Inc. with Ted Turner in 2006. She now serves on international advisory boards for American International Group, The Coca-Cola Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase and Rolls-Royce as well as the board of the U.S.-China Business Council.

In 2008, Yale University granted her an honorary degree. She has also received honorary degrees from other institutions.

She was one of the founders of the Forum for International Policy where she is a trustee.

In 2020, Hills, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

In July 2022, Hills helped found a group of U.S. business and policy leaders who share the goal of constructively engaging with China in order to improve U.S.-China relations.

==North American community==
In 2005, Hills participated in the Task Force on the Future of North America. The Task Force produced a controversial report called &quot;Building a North American Community&quot; sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations. The reported advocated strengthening trading relationships between the U.S., Canada and Mexico by making trade more efficient, building infrastructure in North America, fast tracking borders and integrating language. For example, it recommended assisting “elementary and secondary schools in teaching about North America.” (page 29) “Develop teacher exchange and training programs for elementary and secondary school teachers. This would assist in removing language barriers and give some students a greater sense of a North American identity. Greater efforts should also be made to recruit Mexican language teachers to teach Spanish in the United States and Canada.”

<text>The Siege of Jerusalem marked the successful end of the First Crusade, whose objective was the recovery of the city of Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre from Islamic control. The five-week siege began on 7 June 1099 and was carried out by the Christian forces of Western Europe mobilized by Pope Urban II after the Council of Clermont in 1095. The city had been out of Christian control since the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637 and had been held for a century first by the Seljuk Turks and later by the Egyptian Fatimids. One of the root causes of the Crusades was the hindering of Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land which began in the 4th century. A number of eyewitness accounts of the battle were recorded, including in the anonymous chronicle &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;.

After Jerusalem was captured on 15 July 1099, thousands of Muslims and Jews were massacred by Crusader soldiers. As the Crusaders secured control over the Temple Mount, revered as the site of the two destroyed Jewish Temples, they also seized Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock and repurposed them as Christian shrines. Godfrey of Bouillon, prominent among the Crusader leadership, was elected as the first ruler of Jerusalem

==Background==

=== Muslim conquest of the Levant ===
At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, Pope Urban II received envoys from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos asking Latin Christians for assistance in liberating large parts of the Byzantine Empire from the Seljuks, who had conquered large parts of the region since 1070. Atsiz ibn Uwaq seized Jerusalem from the Fatimid Caliphate, making Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem more difficult and suppressing a revolt in 1077 in a bloodbath. Responding to the call, Urban gave a sermon at the Council of Clermont in November 1095, which included a rousing call to arms for the conquest of the Holy Land and the return of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem to Christian hands. His appeal marked the beginning of the Crusades, a religious war for God, in which he guaranteed participants a place in heaven.

=== Crusader routes ===
After the successful siege of Antioch in June 1098, the Crusaders remained in the area for the rest of the year. The papal legate, Adhemar of Le Puy, had died, and Bohemond of Taranto had claimed Antioch for himself. Baldwin of Boulogne remained in Edessa in Upper Mesopotamia, which had been captured earlier in 1098. There was dissent among the princes over what to do next; Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, frustrated, left Antioch to capture the fortress at Maarat al-Numan in the Siege of Ma&#x27;arra.

By the end of the year, the minor knights and infantry were threatening to march to Jerusalem without them. Eventually, on January 13, 1099, Raymond began the march south along the coast of the Mediterranean, followed by Robert Curthose and Bohemond&#x27;s nephew Tancred, who agreed to become his vassals. On their way, the Crusaders besieged Arqa but failed to capture it, abandoning the siege on May 13. The Fatimids had attempted to make peace on the condition that the Crusaders did not continue towards Jerusalem. This was ignored. Iftikhar al-Dawla, the Fatimid governor of Jerusalem, was aware of the Crusaders&#x27; intentions, and he expelled Jerusalem&#x27;s Christian inhabitants. The further march towards Jerusalem met no resistance.

==Offensive==

=== Fatimid preparations ===
The Fatimid governor Iftikhar al-Dawla prepared the city for the siege after he heard about the arrival of the Crusaders. He prepared an elite troop of 400 Egyptian cavalrymen and expelled all Eastern Christians from the city for fear of being betrayed by them (in the siege of Antioch, an Armenian man, Firouz, had helped Crusaders enter the city by opening the gates). To make the situation worse for the Crusaders, al-Dawla poisoned all the water wells in the surrounding area and cut down all trees outside Jerusalem. On June 7, 1099, the Crusaders reached the outer fortifications of Jerusalem, which the Fatimids had recaptured from the Seljuks only the year before. The city was guarded by a defensive wall stretching four kilometers long, which was three meters thick and fifteen meters high. There were five major gates each guarded by a pair of towers. The Crusaders divided themselves into two large groups: Godfrey of Bouillon, Robert of Flanders and Tancred planned to besiege from north, while Raymond of Toulouse positioned his forces to the south.

=== Dual-front siege ===
The Fatimids now had to be prepared to fight on two fronts. After taking their positions, the Crusaders launched their first attack on June 13; the main problem was that they had no access to wood for the construction of siege equipment, because all the trees had been cut down. However, Tancred had a vision of finding a stack of wood hidden in a cave, and they used it to make a ladder. A knight named Rainbold scaled the ladder to gain a foothold on the wall but was unsuccessful. Since that assault was a failure, the Crusaders retreated and did not make any attempt until they got their tools and equipment. The Crusaders faced many more difficulties such as the lack of water, the scorching summer heat of Palestine, and the shortage of food. By the end of June, word came that a Fatimid army was marching north from Egypt. The mounting pressure forced the Crusaders to act quickly.

=== Final assault ===
On 17 June 1099, the Crusaders heard about the arrival of English and Genoese ships at the port of Jaffa. The English and Genoese sailors had brought all the necessary material with them for the construction of the siege equipment. Robert of Normandy and Robert of Flanders procured timber from the nearby forests. Under the command of Guglielmo Embriaco and Gaston of Béarn, the Crusaders began the construction of their siege weapons. They constructed the finest siege equipment of the 11th century in almost three weeks. This included: two massive wheel-mounted siege towers, a battering ram with an iron-clad head, and numerous scaling ladders and a series of portable wattle screens; now they were ready to attack The Fatimids kept an eye on the preparation by the Franks and they set up their mangonels on the wall in the firing range once an assault began.

On 14 July 1099, the Crusaders launched their attack. Godfrey and his allies were positioned towards the Northern wall of Jerusalem, and their priority was to break through the outer curtain of the walls of the city. By the end of the day they penetrated the first line of defense. On the South Raymond of Toulouse&#x27;s forces were met with ferocious resistance by the Fatimids. On 15 July the assault recommenced in the Northern front; Godfrey and his allies gained success and the Crusader Ludolf of Tournai was the first to mount the wall. The Franks quickly gained a foothold on the wall, and as the city&#x27;s defenses collapsed, waves of panic shook the Fatimids.

In the southwest area the Provencals managed to storm the city walls, which later led to the Crusaders calling the gate they built in this area Beaucaire Gate.

==Aftermath==

=== Crusaders enter Jerusalem ===
On 15 July 1099, the crusaders made their way into the city through the tower of David and began massacring large numbers of the inhabitants, Muslims and Jews alike. The Fatimid governor of the city, Iftikhar Ad-Daulah, managed to escape. Historian Conor Kostick says that the number of people killed is a matter of debate, with the figure of 70,000 given by the Muslim historian Ibn al-Athir (writing c.1200) considered to be a significant exaggeration; 40,000 is plausible, given the city&#x27;s population had been swollen by refugees fleeing the advance of the crusading army.

According to historian of Middle Eastern History, Konrad Hirschler, the massacre during the sack of Jerusalem is a widely depicted event in popular culture, but its historical details remain difficult to verify and reconstruct. Arab sources provide varying casualty estimates, with figures ranging from 3,000 to 70,000 deaths, as cited in works by Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi and Ibn al-Athir, respectively. The higher estimate of 70,000 is generally regarded as implausible, given the city&#x27;s likely population at the time. Medieval chroniclers often exaggerated both troop numbers and casualty figures, making it challenging to determine a precise death toll. As a result, arriving at realistic estimates of the massacre&#x27;s scale is complex and subject to ongoing historical debate.

=== Massacre ===
The aftermath of the siege led to the mass slaughter of thousands of Muslims and Jews which contemporaneous sources suggest was savage and widespread and to the conversion of Muslim holy sites on the Temple Mount into Christian shrines.

Atrocities committed against the inhabitants of cities taken by storm after a siege were normal in ancient and medieval warfare by both Christians and Muslims. The crusaders had already done so at Antioch, and Fatimids had done so themselves at Taormina, at Rometta, and at Tyre. However, it is speculated that the massacre of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, both Muslims and Jews, may have exceeded even these standards.

==== Muslims ====
Many Muslims sought shelter in the al-Aqsa Mosque or Dome of the Rock, both located on the Temple Mount. According to the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;, speaking only of the Temple Mount area, &quot;...[our men] were killing and slaying even to the Temple of Solomon, where the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...&quot; Raymond of Aguilers also wrote about the Temple Mount area: &quot;In the Temple and porch of Solomon men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins.&quot; Writing about the Temple Mount area, Fulcher of Chartres, who was not an eyewitness to the Jerusalem siege because he had stayed with Baldwin in Edessa at the time, says: &quot;In this temple 10,000 were killed. Indeed, if you had been there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared.&quot;

The eyewitness &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; states that some people were spared. Its anonymous author wrote, &quot;When the pagans had been overcome, our men seized great numbers, both men and women, either killing them or keeping them captive, as they wished.&quot; Later the same source writes:
Another eyewitness source, Raymond of Aguilers, reports that some Muslims survived. After recounting the slaughter on the Temple Mount, he reports of some who &quot;took refuge in the Tower of David, and, petitioning Count Raymond for protection, surrendered the Tower into his hands.&quot; These Muslims left with the Fatimid governor for Ascalon. A version of this tradition is also known to the later Muslim historian Ibn al-Athir (10, 193–95), who recounts that after the city was taken and pillaged: &quot;A band of Muslims barricaded themselves into the Oratory of David (Mihrab Dawud) and fought on for several days. They were granted their lives in return for surrendering. The Franks honored their word and the group left by night for Ascalon.&quot; One Cairo Geniza letter also refers to some Jewish residents who left with the Fatimid governor.

Tancred claimed the Temple quarter for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow crusaders. Additionally, the crusaders claimed the Muslim holy sites of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque as important Christian sites. They renamed them &quot;Templum Domini&quot; and &quot;Templum Salomonis,&quot; respectively. In 1141, the &quot;Templum Domini&quot; would be consecrated, and the &quot;Templum Solomonis&quot; would become the headquarters for the Knights Templar.

Albert of Aachen, who personally was not present but wrote using independent interviews conducted with survivors back in Europe, wrote that even beyond the first round of slaughter that accompanied the fall of Jerusalem, there was another round, &quot;On the third day after the victory judgement was pronounced by the leaders and everyone seized weapons and surged forth for a wretched massacre of all the crowd of gentiles which was still left...whom they had previously spared for the sake of money and human pity&quot;. The number killed is not specified, nor is this massacre related in any other contemporary sources.

Although the crusaders killed many of the Muslim and Jewish residents, eyewitness accounts (&quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;, Raymond of Aguilers, and the Cairo Geniza documents) demonstrate that some Muslim and Jewish residents were allowed to live, as long as they left Jerusalem.

==== Jews ====
Rabbinic Jews had fought side-by-side with Muslim soldiers to defend the city, and as the crusaders breached the outer walls, the Jews of the city retreated to their synagogue to &quot;prepare for death&quot;. According to the Muslim chronicle of Ibn al-Qalanisi, &quot;The Jews assembled in their synagogue, and the Franks burned it over their heads.&quot; A contemporary Jewish communication confirms the destruction of the synagogue, though it does not corroborate that any Jews were inside it when it was burned. This letter was discovered among the Cairo Geniza collection in 1975 by historian Shelomo Dov Goitein. Historians believe that it was written just two weeks after the siege, making it &quot;the earliest account on the conquest in any language.&quot; The letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon from the Cairo Geniza indicates that some prominent Jews held for ransom by the crusaders were freed when the Karaite Jewish community in Ascalon paid the cash ransom.

====Eastern Christians====
No eyewitness source refers to crusaders killing Eastern Christians in Jerusalem, and early Eastern Christian sources (Matthew of Edessa, Anna Comnena, Michael the Syrian, etc.) make no such allegation about the crusaders in Jerusalem. According to the Syriac Chronicle, all the Christians had already been expelled from Jerusalem before the crusaders arrived. Presumably this would have been done by the Fatimid governor to prevent their possible collusion with the crusaders.

The &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; claims that on Wednesday, August 9, two and a half weeks after the siege, Peter the Hermit encouraged all the &quot;Greek and Latin priests and clerics&quot; to make a thanksgiving procession to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This indicates that some Eastern Christian clergy remained in or near Jerusalem during the siege. In November 1100, when Fulcher of Chartres personally accompanied Baldwin on a visit to Jerusalem, they were greeted by both Greek and Syrian clerics and laity (Book II, 3), indicating an Eastern Christian presence in the city a year later.

==Founding of the Latin Kingdom==

On 17 July, a council was held to discuss who would be crowned the king of Jerusalem. On 22 July, Godfrey of Bouillon, who had played the most fundamental role in the city&#x27;s conquest, was made &quot;Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri&quot; (&quot;advocate&quot; or &quot;defender&quot; of the Holy Sepulchre). He would not accept the title of king, saying that he refused to wear a crown of gold in the city where Christ wore a crown of thorns. Raymond had refused any title at all, and Godfrey convinced him to give up the Tower of David as well. Raymond then went on a pilgrimage, and in his absence Arnulf of Chocques, whom Raymond had opposed due to his own support for Peter Bartholomew, was elected the first Latin Patriarch on August 1 (the claims of the Greek Patriarch were ignored). On August 5, Arnulf, after consulting the surviving inhabitants of the city, discovered the relic of the True Cross.

On August 12, Godfrey led an army, with the True Cross carried in the vanguard, against the Fatimid army at the Battle of Ascalon of 1099. The crusaders were successful, but following the victory, the majority of them considered their crusading vows to have been fulfilled, and all but a few hundred knights returned home. Nevertheless, their victory paved the way for the establishment of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.

The siege quickly became legendary and in the 12th century it was the subject of the Chanson de Jérusalem, a major &quot;chanson de geste&quot; in the Crusade cycle.

== Conclusion ==
The first crusaders succeeded in their endeavor. Urban II had ignited the flame of holy war in the Council of Clermont. Many other crusades were launched through time for various reasons and motives. Jerusalem remained in Christian hands for almost a century until the crusaders were defeated by Saladin at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and three months later, the last defenders were expelled from the city. The conquest of Jerusalem in the First Crusade has continued to reverberate through time and has ever since shaped relations among the different faith traditions of the region. .

<doc id="950777" wikidata="Q485394" url="?curid=950777" title="Analytic signal">
<text>In mathematics and signal processing, an analytic signal is a complex-valued function that has no negative frequency components.  The real and imaginary parts of an analytic signal are real-valued functions related to each other by the Hilbert transform.

The analytic representation of a real-valued function is an &quot;analytic signal&quot;, comprising the original function and its Hilbert transform. This representation facilitates many mathematical manipulations. The basic idea is that the negative frequency components of the Fourier transform (or spectrum) of a real-valued function are superfluous, due to the Hermitian symmetry of such a spectrum. These negative frequency components can be discarded with no loss of information, provided one is willing to deal with a complex-valued function instead. That makes certain attributes of the function more accessible and facilitates the derivation of modulation and demodulation techniques, such as single-sideband.

As long as the manipulated function has no negative frequency components (that is, it is still &quot;analytic&quot;), the conversion from complex back to real is just a matter of discarding the imaginary part. The analytic representation is a generalization of the phasor concept: while the phasor is restricted to time-invariant amplitude, phase, and frequency, the analytic signal allows for time-variable parameters.

==Definition==

If formula_1 is a &quot;real-valued&quot; function with Fourier transform formula_2 (where formula_3 is the real value denoting frequency), then the transform has Hermitian symmetry about the formula_4 axis:
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the complex conjugate of formula_2.
The function:
:formula_8
where
*formula_9 is the Heaviside step function,
*formula_10 is the sign function,

contains only the &quot;non-negative frequency&quot; components of formula_2. And the operation is reversible, due to the Hermitian symmetry of formula_2:
:formula_13

The analytic signal of formula_1 is the inverse Fourier transform of formula_15:
:formula_16
where
*formula_17 is the Hilbert transform of formula_1;
*formula_19 is the binary convolution operator;
*formula_20 is the imaginary unit.

Noting that formula_21 this can also be expressed as a filtering operation that directly removes negative frequency components:

:formula_22

===Negative frequency components===
Since formula_23, restoring the negative frequency components is a simple matter of discarding formula_24 which may seem counter-intuitive. The complex conjugate formula_25 comprises &quot;only&quot; the negative frequency components. And therefore formula_26 restores the suppressed positive frequency components. Another viewpoint is that the imaginary component in either case is a term that subtracts frequency components from formula_27 The formula_28 operator removes the subtraction, giving the appearance of adding new components.

==Examples==
===Example 1===
:formula_29   where  formula_30

Then:
:formula_31

The last equality is Euler&#x27;s formula, of which a corollary is formula_32 In general, the analytic representation of a simple sinusoid is obtained by expressing it in terms of complex-exponentials, discarding the negative frequency component, and doubling the positive frequency component. And the analytic representation of a sum of sinusoids is the sum of the analytic representations of the individual sinusoids.

===Example 2===
Here we use Euler&#x27;s formula to identify and discard the negative frequency.

:formula_33

Then:
:formula_34

===Example 3===
This is another example of using the Hilbert transform method to remove negative frequency components. Nothing prevents us from computing formula_35 for a complex-valued formula_1. But it might not be a reversible representation, because the original spectrum is not symmetrical in general. So except for this example, the general discussion assumes real-valued formula_1.

:formula_38, where formula_39.

Then:
:formula_40

==Properties==

===Instantaneous amplitude and phase===

An analytic signal can also be expressed in polar coordinates:
:formula_41
where the following time-variant quantities are introduced:
*formula_42 is called the &quot;instantaneous amplitude&quot; or the &quot;envelope&quot;;
*formula_43 is called the &quot;instantaneous phase&quot; or &quot;phase angle&quot;.

In the accompanying diagram, the blue curve depicts formula_1 and the red curve depicts the corresponding formula_45.

The time derivative of the unwrapped instantaneous phase has units of &quot;radians/second&quot;, and is called the &quot;instantaneous angular frequency&quot;:
:formula_46

The &quot;instantaneous frequency&quot; (in hertz) is therefore:
:formula_47  

The instantaneous amplitude, and the instantaneous phase and frequency are in some applications used to measure and detect local features of the signal. Another application of the analytic representation of a signal relates to demodulation of modulated signals. The polar coordinates conveniently separate the effects of amplitude modulation and phase (or frequency) modulation, and effectively demodulates certain kinds of signals.

=== Complex envelope/baseband===
Analytic signals are often shifted in frequency (down-converted) toward 0 Hz, possibly creating [non-symmetrical] negative frequency components:
formula_48
where formula_49 is an arbitrary reference angular frequency.

This function goes by various names, such as &quot;complex envelope&quot; and &quot;complex baseband&quot;. The complex envelope is not unique; it is determined by the choice of formula_49. This concept is often used when dealing with passband signals. If formula_1 is a modulated signal, formula_49 might be equated to its carrier frequency.

In other cases, formula_49 is selected to be somewhere in the middle of the desired passband. Then a simple low-pass filter with real coefficients can excise the portion of interest. Another motive is to reduce the highest frequency, which reduces the minimum rate for alias-free sampling. A frequency shift does not undermine the mathematical tractability of the complex signal representation. So in that sense, the down-converted signal is still &quot;analytic&quot;. However, restoring the real-valued representation is no longer a simple matter of just extracting the real component. Up-conversion may be required, and if the signal has been sampled (discrete-time), interpolation (upsampling) might also be necessary to avoid aliasing.

If formula_49 is chosen larger than the highest frequency of formula_55 then formula_56 has no positive frequencies. In that case, extracting the real component restores them, but in reverse order; the low-frequency components are now high ones and vice versa. This can be used to demodulate a type of single-sideband signal called &quot;lower sideband&quot; or &quot;inverted sideband&quot;.

Other choices of reference frequency are sometimes considered:
* Sometimes formula_49 is chosen to minimize formula_58
* Alternatively, formula_49 can be chosen to minimize the mean square error in linearly approximating the &quot;unwrapped&quot; instantaneous phase formula_60: formula_61
* or another alternative (for some optimum formula_62): formula_63

In the field of time-frequency signal processing, it was shown that the analytic signal was needed in the definition of the Wigner–Ville distribution so that the method can have the desirable properties needed for practical applications.

Sometimes the phrase &quot;complex envelope&quot; is given the simpler meaning of the complex amplitude of a (constant-frequency) phasor;
other times the complex envelope formula_64 as defined above is interpreted as a time-dependent generalization of the complex amplitude. Their relationship is not unlike that in the real-valued case: varying envelope generalizing constant amplitude.

==Extensions of the analytic signal to signals of multiple variables==
The concept of analytic signal is well-defined for signals of a single variable which typically is time. For signals of two or more variables, an analytic signal can be defined in different ways, and two approaches are presented below.

===Multi-dimensional analytic signal based on an ad hoc direction===
A straightforward generalization of the analytic signal can be done for a multi-dimensional signal once it is established what is meant by &quot;negative frequencies&quot; for this case. This can be done by introducing a unit vector formula_65 in the Fourier domain and label any frequency vector formula_66 as negative if formula_67. The analytic signal is then produced by removing all negative frequencies and multiply the result by 2, in accordance to the procedure described for the case of one-variable signals. However, there is no particular direction for formula_65 which must be chosen unless there are some additional constraints. Therefore, the choice of formula_65 is ad hoc, or application specific.

===The monogenic signal===
The real and imaginary parts of the analytic signal correspond to the two elements of the vector-valued monogenic signal, as it is defined for one-variable signals. However, the monogenic signal can be extended to arbitrary number of variables in a straightforward manner, producing an -dimensional vector-valued function for the case of &quot;n&quot;-variable signals.

<text>The Crow Creek massacre occurred around the mid-14th century AD and involved Native American groups at a site along the upper Missouri River in the South Dakota area; it is now within the Crow Creek Indian Reservation. Crow Creek Site, the site of the massacre near Chamberlain, is an archaeological site and a U.S. National Historic Landmark, located at coordinates 43°58′48″N 99°19′54″W. An excavation of part of the site was done in the 1950s, at the time of dam construction on the river. Additional excavations were conducted in 1978 and later.

Two groups occupied the site in prehistoric times. The Siouan-speaking Middle Missouri people (Initial Middle Missouri variant), ancestral to the present-day Mandan people, first occupied the site sometime after about 900 AD. They built numerous earth lodges on the lower portion of the site. Caddoan-speaking Central Plains people (Initial Coalescent variant) moved into the area from southern areas (present-day Nebraska) sometime around 1150 AD. (The present-day Arikara are a Caddoan people.) Whether they displaced the earlier group or moved on to an abandoned site is unknown. The Central Plains (Initial Coalescent) people built at least 55 lodges, mostly on the upper part of the site. There is no direct evidence that there was conflict between the two groups, and scholars have found evidence that both cultures changed gradually in relation to the other.

There is evidence that the Central Plains/Initial Coalescent villagers built well-planned defensive works for their village. They were replacing an earlier dry moat fortification with a new fortification ditch around the expanded village when an attack occurred that resulted in the massacre. The attacking group killed all the villagers.

Archaeologists from the University of South Dakota, directed by project director Larry J. Zimmerman, field director Thomas Emerson, and osteologist P. Wille, found the remains of at least 486 people killed during the attack. Most of these remains showed signs of ritual mutilation, particularly scalping. Other examples were tongues being removed, teeth broken, beheading, hands and feet being cut off, and other forms of dismemberment. In addition to the severity of the attack, most of the people showed signs of malnutrition and many had evidence of earlier wounds, likely from other attacks. This evidence has suggested to scholars that lives of people of the Initial Coalescent culture were under more stress than was thought; they have theorized that the people were attacked by another group or several groups of the Initial Coalescent culture in the area in competition for arable land and resources.

==Site==

The Crow Creek site, designated 39BF11 under the Smithsonian site numbering system, is located along the Missouri River in central South Dakota. The site is located on lands now under the control of the US Army Corps of Engineers due to its flood control and other projects on the river. It is surrounded by the territory of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation. The descendants of the people of the Middle Missouri and Central Plains/Initial Coalescent cultures now live in North Dakota as the Mandan and Arikara nations, respectively, of the Three Affiliated Tribes (together with the Hidatsa). Some occupy Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, but many also live off the reservation in cities.

Crow Creek is now a well-preserved archaeological site. It was listed as National Historic Landmark (number 66000710) when the Register was started in 1964.

In 1978, South Dakota State Archaeologist, Robert Alex, and other members of his office attended a meeting hosted by the South Dakota Archaeological Society. They toured the Crow Creek site, which had been known and had some professional excavation in the 1950s as part of surveys and salvage excavations preceding construction of Big Bend Dam on the Missouri within the reservation boundaries. They discovered human bones eroding from the end of the fortification ditch.

After they received permission to excavate the site from the reservation tribal council, following consultation about how to proceed and agreement to rebury remains on site, archeology teams recovered the skeletal remains of at least 486 Crow Creek villagers. These estimates were based on the number of right temporal bones present at the scene. The characteristics of the remains at the site show they were killed in an overwhelming attack, which has been called the Crow Creek Massacre. Discovery of this event has raised many questions in the archaeological community, particularly who attacked the village and why.

==Skeletal remains==
The remains of the villagers of Crow Creek were discovered in a fortification ditch, where they were buried during the mid-14th century and covered with a small layer of clay from the river bottom. The bodies found in the fortification ditch were piled as deep as four feet in some areas. The bodies showed evidence of having lain out exposed to weather and scavengers for a period of time, becoming at least partly disarticulated before burial. A systematic or formal burial of individual bodies might have been impossible due to the state of the remains by the time of later burial.

It is not clear who buried the victims of the massacre, whether it was the attackers, escaped villagers, or members of an affiliated village. The layer of clay covering the bodies was coated by a &quot;thin and scattered layer of bones,&quot; of which the purpose is unknown. Researchers thought that scavengers might have dug up these remains as a food source. The remains of these villagers reveal their untimely deaths and events of the last attack. They also reveal other hardships of their lives: evidence of nutritional deficiencies and previous warfare, which suggest adaptations to the changes were more difficult. These were documented by paleopathologist John B. Gregg.

===Nutritional deficiencies===
The villagers&#x27; skeletal remains, as well as the fact that remains of canines (dogs) were buried with the villagers, provide evidence of extensive nutritional deficiencies of a chronic nature. According to Zimmerman&#x27;s 1985 book, &quot;Peoples of Prehistoric South Dakota,&quot; the bones reveal several ailments related to chronic malnutrition. As stated in Zimmerman&#x27;s book, &quot;one of the most common characteristics was a pitting in the top of the eye sockets called cribra orbitalis. Associated with this on several skulls was porotic hyperostosis, a pitting on the back of the skull&quot;. Both of these conditions are caused by a deficiency of iron in the diet. In addition to these ailments, Harris lines (an indicator of insufficient amounts of protein and other essential minerals, as well as truncated episodes of growth) were discovered while specialists examined radiographs of several individuals. The Crow Creek villagers were measured as being shorter than their Arikara descendants, with the females being significantly shorter; this could have been another effect of nutritional deficiencies and illness.

In a journal article entitled &quot;The Crow Creek Massacre: Initial Coalescent Warfare and Speculations about the Genesis of Extended Coalescent&quot;, Zimmerman and Bradley propose that the severe conditions faced by the Crow Creek villagers were not short term. Based on the evidence of &quot;active and organizing subperiostial hematomas along with the other bony alterations&quot; found while examining remains, they concluded that the villagers had long suffered malnutrition, in repeated episodes thought due to the unstable climate and drought, which reduced the crop yields and food supplies.

The presence of animal bones within the fortification ditch suggests that villagers ate their dogs because of hunger. Willey and Emerson&#x27;s article entitled &quot;The Osteology and Archaeology of the Crow Creek Massacre&quot; describes the presence of animal bones, specifically canine, within the fortification ditch. They said that it is likely the canines were eaten by the villagers, and their remains were accidentally included in the burial when other parties collected the villagers&#x27; remains. It appears that even domesticated animals such as dogs were used as food sources during this time of famine.

===Evidence of previous warfare===
The skeletal remains of the villagers also showed evidence of earlier wounds. According to the 1982 dissertation entitled &quot;Osteology of the Crow Creek Massacre&quot; by P. Willey, evidence of previous warfare is present in the skeletal remains of victims found in the mass burial. Two individuals had survived previous scalping incidents, and were in the process of healing, which was indicated by the bony re-growth of their skulls; a third individual had survived a head injury as indicated by &quot;a healed depressed fracture in the frontal&quot;. Others showed evidence of being wounded by arrows, the points of which remained in the legs and were overgrown by bone.

===The massacre===
Many of the bodies are missing limbs; the attackers may have taken them as trophies, scavenger animals or birds may have carried them away, or some limbs may have been left unburied in the Crow Creek village. Authors Willey and Emerson state that &quot;they had been killed, mutilated, and scavenged before being buried&quot;. &quot;Tongue removal, decapitation, and dismemberment of the Crow Creek victims may have been based on standard aboriginal butchering practices developed on large game animals&quot;. These are among the mutilations discovered at the Crow Creek site. In addition, scalping was performed, bodies were burned, and there is evidence of limbs being removed by various means. As stated in Willey&#x27;s dissertation, many of the mutilations suffered by the victims of the Crow Creek massacre could have been traumatic enough to result in death.

A conservative estimate of villagers who suffered scalping is 90%, but it could have been as high as 100%. This is based on skeletal remains that exhibit cuts on their skulls indicative of scalping. Men, women, and children were scalped; the only difference was that younger children were cut higher on the skull than other groups.

==Hypotheses==
The events leading to this massacre are unknown, but there are many hypotheses. The most plausible is that this was internecine warfare, and that &quot;overpopulation, land-use patterns, and an unstable climate caused the people to compete for available farmland&quot; and other resources. The malnutrition suffered by the Crow Creek villagers was most likely common for people in that region during this time period. Because of this, there is a strong chance that another Initial Coalescent group or several groups in the region attacked the Crow Creek village for its arable land and resources.

==Reburial and further study==
Before the excavations could proceed, the Corps of Engineers and the University of South Dakota Archaeology Laboratory team consulted with the Crow Creek Sioux Reservation Tribal Council, as well as representatives of the Mandan and Arikara peoples, who now are based mostly on Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. The researchers agreed to the tribal council request that the remains stay within South Dakota for the entire period of study and that, after study, the remains should be reburied on the Crow Creek site, the place where the families had lived and died.

Particularly because of the scale of the reburial, the case attracted international attention. While Native American tribes had been requesting return of remains and artifacts held by museums and historic societies, this would be the largest reburial of remains. Some archeologists and human osteologists criticized the agreement at the time, &quot;contending that new techniques would have allowed substantially more information to be gleaned from the remains if they had been curated for eventual restudy.&quot;

At the request of the Arikara, the remains were placed in five burial vaults. In order to avoid disturbing the site, the vaults were buried in areas where earlier archeological excavations had taken place in the 1950s. The study took three years, and the reburial took place in late summer 1981. Several Christian ceremonies, a traditional Lakota ceremony, and a private Arikara ceremony were offered at the time.

The reburial was controversial and one of the largest ever to have occurred in the United States. Some researchers thought the remains should have been preserved for more study. However, so much skeletal evidence was gathered that many studies were still made through the mid-1990s, based on measurements, photographs, and radiographs of the remains taken during those three years. New (21st century) analyses of the dates on the massacre and the occupational history of the site are also being made, which may change some interpretations.

==Legacy==
Since the reburial, the US Congress and South Dakota legislature have passed laws governing consultation with tribes, and return of remains and artifacts of cultural importance. The most far-reaching federal legislation was the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) (Public Law 101–601).

<doc id="950782" wikidata="Q444106" url="?curid=950782" title="Patricia Roberts Harris">
<text>Patricia Roberts Harris (May 31, 1924March 23, 1985) was an American politician, diplomat, and legal scholar. She served as the 6th United States secretary of housing and urban development from 1977 to 1979 and as the 13th United States secretary of health and human services from 1979 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter. She previously served as the United States ambassador to Luxembourg from 1965 to 1967 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout her public career, Harris was a trailblazer for women and people of color to hold a number of positions, including the first African American woman and woman of color ever to serve in a presidential cabinet and the first woman and person of color appointed to two different presidential cabinet positions. She was the first African American HHS secretary and just the second black HUD secretary, as well as the second woman to lead either of those executive departments. Furthermore, she was the first black woman U.S. ambassador, the dean of a U.S. law school, and a member of a Fortune 500 company&#x27;s board of directors. A member of the Democratic Party, she ran for mayor of the District of Columbia in the 1982 mayoral election but was defeated during the primaries, ultimately finishing second to incumbent mayor Marion Barry.

==Early life==
Patricia Roberts was born on May 31, 1924, in Mattoon, Illinois, the daughter of railroad dining car waiter Bert Fitzgerald Roberts and Hildren Brodie (&quot;née&quot; Johnson). She had one younger brother, Malcolm, known to his family as Mickey. Her parents separated when she was 6 years old, after which she was raised primarily by her mother and grandmother, attending public school in Chicago.

== Education ==
After earning scholarships to five different colleges, Roberts selected Howard University, from which she graduated, summa cum laude, in 1945. While at Howard, she was elected Phi Beta Kappa and served as Vice Chairman of the Howard University chapter of the NAACP. During her time at Howard University, she was also a member of Delta Sigma Theta — a historically Black sorority that had been founded at Patricia&#x27;s alma mater in 1913. In 1943, she participated in one of the nation&#x27;s first lunch counter sit-ins. She did graduate work in industrial relations at the University of Chicago from 1946 to 1949. In order to be better involved in civil rights work, she transferred to American University in 1949, where she would ultimately receive her Master&#x27;s Degree.

After marrying in 1955, Harris was beginning to pursue a career in education, but saw limited opportunity because of segregation. Her husband encouraged her to go to law school, and she received her J.D. from the George Washington University National Law Center in 1960, ranking number one out of a class of ninety-four students. She passed the bar exam the same year.

In 1965, Harris was honored in absentia with the Alumni Achievement Award of George Washington University Law School.

==Career==
While studying in Chicago, Roberts was a program director for the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association. While at American University, she concurrently worked as the Assistant Director of the American Council on Human Rights, beginning in 1949 and staying until 1953. Her first position with the U.S. government was in 1960 as an attorney in the appeals and research section of the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice. There she met and struck up a friendship with Robert F. Kennedy, the new attorney general.

One year later, Harris took a job as a lecturer and the Associate Dean of Students at Howard University. In 1963, she ceased her role as Dean, but stayed on as a lecturer. Concurrently, from 1962–65, she worked with the National Capital Area Civil Liberties Union. As her skills as an organizer bloomed, Harris also became increasingly involved in the Democratic Party. In 1963, she was elevated to a full professorship at Howard, and President John F. Kennedy appointed her co-chairman of the National Women&#x27;s Committee for Civil Rights, described as an &quot;umbrella organization encompassing some 100 women&#x27;s groups throughout the nation.&quot; Her co-chair was Mildred McAfee Horton.
In 1964, Harris was elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from the District of Columbia. She worked in Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s presidential campaign and seconded his nomination at the 1964 Democratic Convention. In October 1965, President Johnson appointed her Ambassador to Luxembourg, a role she served in until the end of the Johnson administration. She was the first African American woman named as an American envoy. She said of her appointment, &quot;I feel deeply proud and grateful this President chose me to knock down this barrier, but also a little sad about being the &#x27;first Negro woman,&#x27; because it implies we were not considered before.&quot; Additionally, Johnson named her as alternate delegate to the United Nations General Assembly for the years 1966-68.

In 1967, Harris returned to the faculty of Howard University&#x27;s School of Law, where she was named Dean in 1969, another first for a Black woman. She resigned as Dean a month later when Howard University President James E. Cheek refused to support her strong stand against student protests. She then joined Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, one of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s most prestigious law firms.

In 1971, Harris was named to the board of directors of IBM, becoming the first Black American woman to sit on a Fortune 500 company&#x27;s board of directors. In addition, she served on the boards of Scott Paper, the National Bank of Washington, and Chase Manhattan Bank. Upon her appointment to the Chase Manhattan board, she observed: &quot;The demands on the small pool of Blacks allowed to develop in the last 300 years is too great. What has to happen is that this pool must be increased, and that&#x27;s something that big corporations can help to do. I&#x27;m a first on many boards, but I&#x27;m not going to be content to remain the only Black, or the only woman.&quot;

Harris continued making an impact on the Democratic Party when, in 1972, she was appointed chairman of the credentials committee and, in 1973, a member-at-large of the Democratic National Committee. President Jimmy Carter appointed her to two cabinet-level posts during his administration.

=== Cabinet Secretary ===

Harris was appointed to the cabinet of President Jimmy Carter as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) when Carter took office in 1977. At her confirmation hearing, Senator William Proxmire questioned whether Harris came from a background of too much wealth and power to be an effective HUD Secretary. She responded, &quot;I am a Black woman, the daughter of a Pullman (railroad) car waiter. I am a Black woman who even eight years ago could not buy a house in parts of the District of Columbia. I didn&#x27;t start out as a member of a prestigious law firm, but as a woman who needed a scholarship to go to school. If you think I have forgotten that, you are wrong.&quot; Otherwise, her confirmation went smoothly. By this time in Harris&#x27; life, she had established herself as not only a recognized leader for civil rights, but also as a prominent corporate lawyer and businesswoman. Once confirmed, Harris became the first African American woman to enter the Presidential line of succession. She served as HUD Secretary from 1977 to 1979, reorganizing the department and shifting from knocking down slums to rehabilitating the neighborhoods through millions of dollars of funding and her Neighborhood Strategy Program for rebuilding, Urban Development Action Grants for luring businesses back into cities, and an expanded Urban Homesteading Plan. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, looking back at her reforms several years later, noted: &quot;[A]fter two years as secretary, the agency had changed from a mere extension of the nation&#x27;s housing industry to an advocate for saving inner cities.&quot;

As a result of her success leading HUD, Carter appointed Harris as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the largest Cabinet agency, in 1979. Once again, the confirmation process was easy. After the Department of Education Organization Act came into force on May 4, 1980, the department&#x27;s education functions were transferred to the Department of Education. Harris remained as Secretary of the renamed Department of Health and Human Services until Carter left office in 1981. Because the department had merely changed names, as opposed to disbanding with a new department being created, she did not face Senate confirmation again after the change. During her tenure with the Department, Harris faced several budget crises and refreshed the management team.

Harris offered a number of critiques of her own work in these cabinet positions, including that enforcement of civil rights fell off while she was head of HHS, that Congress called her responses to requests for policy changes that would lower health care costs sluggish, and that many of her programs ended up doing little for her hometown of Washington, D.C.

On the other hand, Office of Management and Budget Associate Director Dennis Green described her approach as &quot;tough-minded, intelligent, quick to grasp the intricacies of her agency, and she went after what she wanted.&quot;

=== Post-government ===
In 1981, Harris was appointed a full-time professor at the George Washington University Law School. She remained on the faculty until her death in 1985.

Harris ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Washington, D.C., in 1982, losing the September 14 primary election to incumbent mayor Marion Barry. Among several factors leading to the loss, including her brusque, no-nonsense means of communication, some scholars have listed that Washington, D.C., had never elected a female mayor. However, the city&#x27;s first female mayor, Sharon Pratt (1991–95), cut her teeth as Harris&#x27; campaign manager for her mayoral race.

== Personal life and death ==
During her tenure at the American Council on Human Rights, Harris first met William Beasley Harris, then a member of the Howard law faculty and later a federal Maritime Commission administrative judge. They began dating in 1955, and were married on September 1, 1955.

Harris was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority and served for six years as its first national executive director.

In 1967, Lord Snowdon photographed Harris at the United Nations for &quot;Vogue&quot;. In her spare time, Harris enjoyed cooking and baking.

Harris&#x27;s husband died in November 1984. She died of breast cancer at age 60 on March 23, 1985. She was interred at the Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

== Legacy ==
Upon her death, Harris endowed the Patricia Roberts Harris Public Affairs Fellowship to enable Howard University students to undertake domestic and international public affairs internships. Established in 1987, the program provides a stipend for a summer internship, along with mentoring, academic, and service learning opportunities; it has so far served over 200 Fellows.

On January 27, 2000, the United States Postal Service&#x27;s released its 23rd commemorative stamp in its Black Heritage Series, honoring Harris. The stamp was designed by Richard Sheaff of Scottsdale, Arizona, and 150 million copies were produced in recognition of Black History Month. Additionally, in 2003, Harris was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="950790" wikidata="Q7145621" url="?curid=950790" title="Patricia Harris">
<text>Patricia Harris (born September 1, 1956) is the chief executive officer of Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s philanthropic foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies. She was first deputy mayor for the City of New York from 2002 to December 31, 2013. She advised the Mayor of New York City, then Bloomberg, on administrative, operational, and policy matters. In 2022, she was included on &quot;Forbes&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 50 over 50 list and in 2016, she was named one of the magazine&#x27;s most powerful women in the world.

==Early life and education==

Born in 1956 and raised in New York City, Harris became interested in public service in high school at Ethical Culture Fieldston School in Riverdale, where she volunteered in then Congressman Ed Koch’s office.

In 1977, Harris graduated from Franklin &amp; Marshall College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government. Franklin and Marshall&#x27;s Harris Center for Business, Government, and Public Policy was donated in her name in 2009, and she has served on the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees since 2006.

==Career==

In 1977, Harris began her public service career as an assistant to Congressman Koch. Upon Koch&#x27;s election as Mayor, she became an Assistant to the deputy mayor in 1979, and subsequently was appointed Assistant to the mayor for Federal Affairs. From 1983 to 1990, she served as executive director of the City&#x27;s Art Commission.

Following her work with the Koch Administration, Harris served as vice president for Public Relations at Serino Coyne Advertising before joining Bloomberg LP in 1994, where she managed Bloomberg LP&#x27;s Philanthropy, Public Relations, and Governmental Affairs divisions. Harris is generally credited with introducing founder Michael Bloomberg to the worlds of art and philanthropy.

Harris joined Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s administration when he was elected mayor in 2001, serving first as deputy mayor for Administration until 2005, when she was appointed first deputy mayor. Harris was the first woman in New York City&#x27;s history to serve in this role. Harris is known as a key trusted adviser to Bloomberg, and she weighs in on every major policy or personnel decision.

According to Kevin Sheekey, whom Harris hired at Bloomberg LP in 1997 and who served as campaign manager when Bloomberg ran for president in 2020, &quot;...almost anything that Mike has done in the political or philanthropic sector, you can trace its roots back somewhere to a Patti Harris origin.&quot;

Harris has been included on &quot;Crain&#x27;s Business New York&quot; list of the most powerful women in New York City every year since the list began in 2011 and, according to a New York Times profile, she was the most powerful person in the Bloomberg administration.

Harris currently serves as the chief executive officer of Bloomberg Philanthropies, and she is the only person to serve in the role. The organization was set up by Michael Bloomberg who has pledged to give away all his wealth. From her position leading the foundation, Harris oversees Bloomberg&#x27;s philanthropic giving, which he values as a key component of his legacy. Michael Bloomberg has been identified as one of the top five largest donors in America since 2015 and over the course of his lifetime, as of February 2023, has given away $14.4 billion.

In a 2018 profile, speaking of Harris&#x27;s role at Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bloomberg said &quot;Patti is the foundation.&quot; As of 2016, she is listed as the 87th most powerful woman in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; and she appeared in the 2019 &quot;Politico&quot; Playbook Power List

In addition to serving on the board of trustees for her alma mater Franklin and Marshall College, Harris is a trustee of the 9/11 Memorial Museum in New York City and a board member of both the Perelman Performing Arts Center and the Public Art Fund.

<doc id="950800" wikidata="Q2353099" url="?curid=950800" title="M-46 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-46 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan between Muskegon and Port Sanilac, terminating near Lake Michigan and Lake Huron on each end. Except for the north–south segment that corresponds with the US Highway 131 (US 131) freeway between Cedar Springs and Howard City, M-46 is practically a due east–west surface highway. The road runs through rural sections of the Lower Peninsula connecting several freeways including US 31, US 131, US 127 and Interstate 75 (I-75).

The highway was formed by July 1, 1919, along two discontinuous sections of its current corridor. The gap was filled in by 1927, but a second break in the routing was created in the 1930s. This second interruption in the corridor was eliminated within a year. The various paths that M-46 has followed have been straightened over the intervening years, producing the modern corridor by the 1970s. Other changes have been made to the location of the western terminus in Muskegon, but it has remained fixed in its current location since 1984.

==Route description==
M-46 is one of three trans-peninsular highways in the Lower Peninsula, starting blocks away from Lake Michigan in Muskegon and running almost to Lake Huron in Port Sanilac. The other two highways that do this are M-55 (Manistee – Tawas City) and M-72 (Empire–Harrisville). The highway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highway highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 1,855 vehicles used the highway daily near the eastern terminus. The peak traffic volumes were the 30,505 vehicles AADT along the section of M-46 immediately east of the US 31 freeway near Muskegon. The trunkline has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) between the western terminus and US 31, and between Cedar Springs and the M-53 junction in Sanilac County. The NHS is a network of roadways important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

===Muskegon to Saginaw===
M-46 starts at an intersection between Muskegon and Apple avenues near the downtown Muskegon business district. The highway follows Apple Avenue eastward through the edge of the district and through a residential area in Muskegon to an interchange with the US 31 freeway. On the other side of the freeway, Apple Avenue runs farther east, leaving the Muskegon area and passing through the rural woodlands of Muskegon County. Along the way, the road passes the Hall Drain, an artificial reservoir. At Casnovia, M-37 merges in from the north at a roundabout intersection, and the two highways run concurrently across the county line into Kent County, turning to the southeast. A few miles later in Kent City, M-46 turns due east again and leaves M-37 to run independently along 17 Mile Road. The highway runs through more mixed agricultural land to Cedar Springs, where M-46 turns north along the US 131 freeway.

US 131/M-46 runs northwards through the northern Kent and western Montcalm counties for about near Sand Lake and Pierson. Near Howard City. M-46 leaves the freeway and turns eastward independently along Howard City – Edmore Road. The highway runs through the north side of Montcalm County connecting the communities of Lakeview and Edmore. Between Six Lakes and Edmore, M-66 runs along M-46, a distance of around . The trunkline passes several small lakes and crosses the Maple River near Vestaburg before crossing into Gratiot County. The highway, now called Monroe Road crosses more farm fields as it approaches Alma. North of downtown, M-46 intersects the north–south leg of the Alma business loop before meeting the US 127 freeway. East of this freeway interchange, M-46 picks up the east–west leg of the US 127 business loop for St. Louis. Although similar, the separate business loop follows M-46 along Monroe Road over the Pine River to Main Street, where it turns south through downtown. M-46 continues eastward from town through farm fields to Breckenridge. At Meridian Road, the highway follows Gratiot Road into Saginaw County east through Merrill and Hemlock to the Saginaw area. East of Hemlock, M-46 meets the northern terminus of M-52 and then the southern terminus of M-47 in Saginaw Charter Township near its crossing of the Tittabawassee River.

===Saginaw to Port Sanilac===
As M-46 enters Saginaw proper, it follows Gratiot Avenue past the Saginaw Country Club. The area around the club is filled with residential subdivisions as the roadway approaches the Saginaw River. M-46 follows Stephens Street southeasterly and Rust Avenue eastward to cross the river. The highway continues along Rust Avenue to Warren Avenue where it turns north. The highway then follows Holland Avenue, which is the continuation of Gratiot Avenue on the east side of the river. M-46 passes through an interchange with I-75/US 23 and leaves the Saginaw area. The highway continues eastward through rural Saginaw County into the region of the Lower Peninsula known as The Thumb. In Tuscola County, M-46 passes through the Vassar State Game Area and crosses the Cass River north of Vassar.

The area near the river east to the M-24 junction is forested. As M-46 approaches Kingston, farms dominate the landscape again. M-46 crosses into Sanilac County just west of the M-53 junction at Van Dyke Road. Between Elmer and Sandusky, M-19 follows M-46 for about . The highway crosses the Black River near Carsonville. The eastern end of M-46 is in Port Sanilac, just blocks west of the city&#x27;s marina on Lake Huron at an intersection with M-25.

==History==
M-46 was designated by July 1, 1919, on a discontinuous route that ran between Howard City and Saginaw and between rural Tuscola County and Port Sanilac. The highway followed a different routing in place than it does today. The western terminus was in downtown Howard City, rather than north of town. The road ran farther south in Gratiot County so that it went into downtown Alma. By the end of 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) filled in the gap between Saginaw and Tuscola County, and the department extended the western end to Muskegon. M-46 followed the contemporary US 131 between Cedar Springs and Howard City and the modern routing west to Muskegon ending at US 31 downtown. In the middle of the 1930s, the section north of Howard City was straightened, removing the angled route between Amble and Howard City in favor of a more direct connection to US 131. The US 131 and M-37 concurrencies were removed, however, when the section between Kent City and Cedar Springs was removed from the highway system. That gap was eliminated in late 1936 when M-46 was routed down US 131 to Howard City and along M-82 to Newaygo. From there, it followed M-37 south to Casnovia. A new road was opened in early 1937 between Vestaburg and Alma, which was designated as part of M-46 by the end of the year. The western terminus was extended farther west through Muskegon to the outlet of Muskegon Lake on Lake Michigan as well. The M-82 concurrency was removed in 1938, and a more direct routing between Six Lakes and Edmore opened at the same time.

By the end of the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of terminating in the park at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US 16 to the car ferry docks. The last section of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US 131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US 131 again.
 In the process, M-46 replaced a section of M-57 that had been designated along 17 Mile Road in late 1948 or early 1949. The last change to M-46&#x27;s routing was made in the early 1980s. The extension through Muskegon to the car ferry docks was reversed, truncating the highway to its current terminus at then-Bus. US 31 in 1984. The business loop was shifted away from this location in 2007, leaving M-46 to terminate at a junction with a city street instead of another state highway.

<text>The Alberta Order of Excellence () is a civilian honour for merit in the Canadian province of Alberta. Instituted in 1979 when Lieutenant Governor Frank C. Lynch-Staunton granted royal assent to the Alberta Order of Excellence Act, the order is administered by the Governor-in-Council and is intended to honour current or former Alberta residents for conspicuous achievements in any field, being thus described as the highest honour amongst all others conferred by the Canadian Crown in right of Alberta.

==Structure and appointment==

The Alberta Order of Excellence is intended to honour any current or former long-time resident of Alberta who has demonstrated a high level of individual excellence and achievement in any field, having &quot;rendered service of the greatest distinction and of singular excellence for or on behalf of the residents of Alberta.&quot; Canadian citizenship is a requirement, and those who are elected or appointed members of a governmental body are ineligible as long as they hold office. Only 10 people may be inducted each year, though a nomination may remain up for consideration by the council for seven years.

The process of finding qualified individuals begins with submissions from the public to the Council of the Alberta Order of Excellence, which consists of six individuals without prequalification appointed by the lieutenant governor and meets once yearly to make its selected recommendations to the viceroy each June; posthumous nominations are not accepted. The lieutenant governor, who is &quot;ex officio&quot; a member and the Chancellor of the Alberta Order of Excellence and remains a member following his or her departure from viceregal office, then makes all appointments into the fellowship&#x27;s single grade of membership by letters patent bearing the viceroyal sign-manual and the Great Seal of the province. Thereafter, the new members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;AOE&quot; and have their portrait added to two galleries, one each at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium and Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium.

==Insignia==

Upon admission into the Alberta Order of Excellence, in a ceremony held at Government House in Edmonton, members are presented with the order&#x27;s insignia. According to Insignia Regulation, which stipulates the design of the order&#x27;s badges and ribbon and how they are worn, the main emblem of the order is a gold medallion in the form of a cross &quot;pattée&quot;, with the equidistant arms consisting of a transparent blue enamel over gold patterned to resemble prairie wheat. This cross is layered between a burnished gold disk bearing roses and rose leaves, and another roundel with the coat of arms of Alberta on a red enamel background, surrounded by a white circle bearing the words &quot;The Alberta Order of Excellence&quot;. On the reverse is a maple leaf supported by a sheaf of wheat. The ribbon is patterned with vertical stripes in blue, burgundy, white, and gold, reflecting the colours within the provincial coat of arms; men wear the medallion suspended from this ribbon at the collar, while women carry theirs on a ribbon bow at the left chest. Members also receive a lapel pin for wear on casual clothing.

<doc id="950807" wikidata="Q465401" url="?curid=950807" title="Shirley Hufstedler">
<text>Shirley Ann Mount Hufstedler (August 24, 1925 – March 30, 2016) was an American attorney and judge who served as the first United States Secretary of Education from 1979 to 1981. She previously served as a U.S. circuit judge of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals from 1968 to 1979.

At the time of her presidential cabinet appointment under President Jimmy Carter, she was the highest ranking-woman in the U.S. federal judiciary.

==Early life and education==
Hufstedler was born Shirley Ann Mount on August 24, 1925, in Denver, Colorado. Her mother&#x27;s side of the family emigrated to the United States from Germany and were pioneers in Missouri. Hufstedler&#x27;s father worked in construction and during the Great Depression the family had to move frequently so he could find work. As a result, she frequently changed schools and towns starting in the second grade. As a child, she lived in New Mexico, Montana, California, and Wyoming. A friend of her father&#x27;s and famous war correspondent, Ernie Pyle, became a close friend and mentor of Hufstedler. Hufstedler received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1945 from the University of New Mexico and a Bachelor of Laws in 1949 from Stanford Law School.

== Career ==
Initial attempts to begin her career after graduating proved to be difficult. Her graduating class from law school included only two women, as three of them dropped out, and although she graduated at the top of her class, she was still a woman in a male-dominated profession and she struggled to find employment opportunities. She started writing briefs for other lawyers and picked up other similar tasks. Ultimately, she opened up her own office in Los Angeles in 1951. From there, she managed to make her way to the Attorney General&#x27;s Office. She served as Special Legal Consultant to the Attorney General of California in the complex Colorado River litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court from 1960 to 1961.

===California Superior Court Judge===
In 1961, she was appointed Judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, by Governor Pat Brown. a position to which she was elected in 1962 as a Democrat. At the time she was appointed to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, she was the only female in a group of 119 men. Judge Shirley M. Hufstedler is widely credited with introducing tentative rulings to American courts while sitting in Los Angeles Superior Court.

In 1966, she was appointed Associate Justice of the California Court of Appeals.

===Federal judicial service===
Hufstedler was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 17, 1968, to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, to a new seat authorized by 82 Stat. 184. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on September 12, 1968, and received her commission on September 12, 1968. Her service terminated on December 5, 1979, due to her resignation.

==== Selected judicial opinions ====
In 1973, a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided in &quot;Lau v. Nichols&quot; that the San Francisco Unified School District had not violated the Fourteenth Amendment when it provided inadequate supplemental language support for non-English speakers. Hufstedler was not a member of this panel, but she called for the case to be reheard by the entire Ninth Circuit Court, &quot;en banc&quot;. Hufstedler wrote, &quot;access to education offered by the public schools is completely foreclosed to these children who cannot comprehend any of it&quot; and that the decision paralleled similar arguments that were determined to be unconstitutional in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Subsequently, the U. S. Supreme Court agreed with Hufstedler and overturned the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision.

Hufstedler authored the majority opinion in &quot;Dietemann v. Time, Inc.&quot; (1971) Reporters employed by &quot;Life&quot; magazine would deceive their way into private homes and then record information and interactions between individuals in the home. Hufstedler affirmed the lower court&#x27;s decision that such actions were an invasion of privacy. This helped provide clarity on freedom of the press and specifically, the limitations that the First Amendment has on protecting the freedom of the press.

Hufstedler was in the majority for &quot;Warren Jones Co. v. Commissioner&quot; (1975). In this case, the majority decided that real estate had a certain fair market value which was determinable. Thus, taxpayers were required to include that fair market value in tax return calculations.

===Secretary of Education===
Hufstedler joined the Carter administration when appointed to be the first U.S. Secretary of Education in 1979. As the first Secretary of Education, Hufstedler&#x27;s agenda has been depicted as being focused on strengthening state and federal interrelationships, as well as educational equity. Her dedication toward educational needs helped set precedent in the importance of its existence, even later preventing President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s attempts to dismantle it all together after he beat President Carter in 1980.

===Later career===
Hufstedler was considered to be a candidate for the Supreme Court if a vacancy had occurred under the Jimmy Carter presidency. In 1981, Hufstedler returned to private life, teaching and practicing law. She was a partner in the firm Hufstedler &amp; Kaus, now merged into Morrison &amp; Foerster. She taught across the country, including stints at the University of California at Irvine and Santa Cruz, the University of Iowa, the University of Vermont, Stanford Law School, and the University of Oregon.
==Personal life==
Hufstedler met her husband, Seth Hufstedler, at law school and they married in 1949. They had one child, Dr. Steve Hufstedler, and four grandchildren.

Hufstedler appears in the 2009 film biography of pioneering aviator and hostess Pancho Barnes, &quot;The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club&quot;, billed as &quot;Pancho&#x27;s legal advisor.&quot;

On March 30, 2016, Hufstedler died in Glendale, California, from cerebrovascular disease at the age of 90. She is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale).

<doc id="950814" wikidata="Q7841694" url="?curid=950814" title="Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)">
<text>Colin Arthur Ball, better known as Trigger, is a fictional character in the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and its prequel &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. He was played by Roger Lloyd-Pack in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and Lewis Osbourne in &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. According to Del Boy, he earned the nickname &quot;Trigger&quot; because he looks like a horse.

== Characteristics ==

A regular at the Nag&#x27;s Head pub, and old friend of Del Boy, Trigger is a road sweeper - looking after a 20 year-old broom that is an example of the Ship of Theseus paradox - and also engages in trading and petty thefts. Trigger speaks in a slow, monotone voice, and is very simple-minded, although affable and warm-hearted. Trigger did not know his father, saying &quot;he died a couple of years before I was born&quot;, when Rodney asks of his whereabouts in the episode &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;. He was brought up by his grandparents, with his grandfather having also been a road sweeper. When Trigger is pushed by Boycie to say who his mother had written down on the birth certificate as Trigger&#x27;s father, Trigger says, reluctantly, &quot;Some soldiers&quot;. The 2015 official &quot;autobiography&quot; of Del Boy, &quot;He Who Dares&quot;, states of Trigger: &quot;It was generally agreed though that his dad was Donald Turpin (brother of Mum&#x27;s best mate, Reenie)... when Elsie started showing, she claimed she&#x27;d been &#x27;visited by an angel!&#x27;, leading the rest of the Ball clan to start making plans for the arrival of a new messiah. But Donald had been heard bragging about how he&#x27;d lost his virginity... giving full details of the time and place, and was therefore fingered as a much more likely suspect than the Archangel Gabriel.&quot; His birth certificate can be seen in the &quot;Peckham Archives&quot; book, where his middle name is given as Arthur (from his grandfather).

Trigger is not married, but he occasionally mentions past relationships during the series and is seen on a blind date with a woman in the 1988 Christmas special, &quot;Dates&quot;.

Trigger always calls Rodney Trotter &quot;Dave&quot;. Rodney corrects him in &quot;Homesick&quot;, and he agrees to stop, but a few seconds later he calls him &quot;Dave&quot; again. When Cassandra, Rodney&#x27;s wife, announced she was pregnant in &quot;Modern Men&quot;, everybody raised a toast &quot;To Cassandra and Rodney&quot;, but Trigger can be heard saying &quot;Dave&quot; after everyone else has spoken. At another point, while discussing Del and Raquel&#x27;s son, Trigger reports that &quot;if it&#x27;s a boy, they&#x27;re naming him Rodney, after Dave&quot;.

== Appearances ==

Trigger appeared in the first episode and continued to appear regularly throughout the entire show&#x27;s run. He is an example of a breakout character in that he became popular with the show&#x27;s audience, despite his status as a minor, supporting character.

Trigger appears as a teenager in the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; prequel series, &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. He is a relatively minor character in the prequel series, but in &quot;The Frog and the Pussycat&quot;, Violet Trotter, Del&#x27;s grandmother, mentions Grandad&#x27;s affair with Trigger&#x27;s grandmother, Alice Ball. This is the first time in the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; franchise that Trigger&#x27;s real name is mentioned. At one point in the pilot episode, Reg asks Del and Jumbo if Trigger is mentally OK, since he once spotted Trigger laughing at a television set which was turned off. 

Trigger was scripted to appear in the 2014 &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; sketch for Sport Relief, but Lloyd-Pack died on 15 January 2014, from pancreatic cancer. The script was subsequently rewritten to omit his role, although it is mentioned in the sketch that Trigger cannot assist Del and Rodney with their latest business venture because he is working at the market. The sketch was dedicated to the memory of Lloyd-Pack and John Sullivan.

<doc id="950815" wikidata="Q2300752" url="?curid=950815" title="Lum (Urusei Yatsura)">
<text>Lum the Invader Girl (), known in Japan simply as , is a fictional character and the female protagonist of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s manga series &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;. She is often believed to be the main protagonist of the series due to her iconic status. However, Takahashi has stated that Ataru Moroboshi is the main character.

She is named Lamu in Animax&#x27;s English-language dub of the series, and in the Italian and French anime dubs as well; however she is still called &quot;Lum&quot; in the Spanish anime dub. Her name is thought to come from popular 1970s swimsuit model Agnes Lum, as well as Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Rum&quot; or &quot;Lum&quot; (from the interchangeable sound of the Rs and Ls in Japanese).

Lum is considered a magical girlfriend, though significantly different from others such as Belldandy of &quot;Oh! My Goddess&quot; and Ai of &quot;Video Girl Ai&quot;. While the latter two are openly considered &quot;ideal&quot; women by the protagonists of their respective series, Ataru often indicates publicly that Lum is the opposite of ideal.

==Creation and conception==
Lum was created by Rumiko Takahashi for a short story she was working on before her professional debut. She worked meticulously on designing her hairstyle and body shape. However, the outspoken and uninhibited Lum is the author&#x27;s polar opposite. This proved to Takahashi that she could draw characters who do not reflect herself at all.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;===
Lum is royalty and the daughter of the alien Invader called oni and can fly and generate massive electrical discharges. She generally wears a tiger-striped bikini and go-go boots that highlight her shapely figure, and has two tiny horns on her head that, when sprayed with a special solution, can be shaped to resemble barrettes. When these horns are removed (or when specially blessed yellow ribbons are tied around them), her electric and flying abilities disappear and she becomes a regular girl. Her hair color was originally iridescent and ever-changing in the manga; due to difficulties in making such an effect possible when the anime was originally produced, Lum&#x27;s hair was given the shade of cyan it is best known for. Lum&#x27;s appearance and clothing (and that of her family) draw heavily on the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin.

She grew up on her homeworld, Oniboshi (&quot;planet of the oni&quot;), a precocious girl. She attended primary school with Benten of the rivals of the oni: the Lucky Gods, Oyuki, the ice princess, and Ran. There, the four of them developed a reputation for causing massive amounts of trouble. Ran often got roped into their mischief and took all the blame, while Lum got off unharmed, leading Ran to seek revenge. Lum, Benten, and Oyuki&#x27;s reputation grew in junior high school, and they became a school gang. Lum later got engaged to a handsome oni named Rei but rejected him because of his dullness.

Some time afterward, the oni attempted to invade the Earth, an event that would change her life forever. That day, Lum met Ataru Moroboshi for the first time. He had been randomly selected by computer to face her in a game of tag with the fate of the earth on the line. Ataru had been promised marriage by his then-girlfriend Shinobu Miyake if he could win, which spurred him to success, but upon catching Lum, he declared, &quot;Now I can get married!&quot; Lum misinterpreted this as a proposal to herself and accepted it. Because engagements are sacred on her planet, she is determined to be married to Ataru for the rest of her life. Since then, she has forced her way into his life as his &quot;loving wife,&quot; much to his chagrin because it compromised his ability to flirt. The relationship between Lum and Ataru has been called &quot;a humorously exaggerated parody of a common Japanese husband and wife dynamic.&quot;

===In other franchises===
In the manga series &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, Lum makes a cameo appearance when Conan Edogawa asks Ai Haibara about her knowing about a Black Organization member named &quot;Rum&quot;, and Haibara&#x27;s first reaction is to think of Lum, due to the use of the syllable &quot;ra&quot; for the Japanese spelling of both names. Likewise, Kanenori Wakita&#x27;s codename as a member of the Black Organization, &quot;Rum&quot;, is used as an injoke by Gosho Aoyama in relation to Lum. Also, the character Rumi Wakasa, who is a &quot;Rum&quot; suspect, shares the same voice actress as Lum in the &quot;Detective Conan&quot; anime adaptation.

==Characterization==
===Personality===
Because of her exotic beauty, Lum has become extremely popular with the boys at Tomobiki High School. Despite this, she refutes all of their advances since she is devoted to Ataru. Most of the time, she is very laid back, enjoying the quirks and perks of life on Earth. But she is quick to anger and responds with powerful electric discharges to anyone who enrages her, usually Ataru or any person who attacks or insults her &quot;Darling&quot;. Once the threat passes, Lum reverts to her usual cheery attitude.

Lum is very intelligent, but very naive about life on earth, with a worldview comparable to that of a kindergartener. She does not understand why the other boys at school feel that the philandering Ataru is not good enough for her, but she cares about their well-being. She has successfully adapted herself to life on Earth thanks to her technology. She still struggles to keep her younger cousin Ten from wreaking havoc thanks to his own naiveté about human behavior. For the most part, however, people who look at her for the first time view her as a highly attractive schoolgirl, despite her obviously different appearance. She has the qualities of the ideal wife and daughter-in-law in Japanese society as she takes good care of her darling and she helps her &quot;mother-in-law&quot; with the housework whenever she is free.

Lum is well-versed in the use of technology, and carries a variety of advanced gadgets from her society with her, with the stranger gadgets hidden in her bikini top. But while her intentions in operating them are often noble, such as copying a notebook to help Ataru study for an exam, the results are rarely what Lum intends. This may be in part because she is naive regarding the customs of Earth, so she often misunderstands what people say. The best example of this is her innocent misinterpretation of Ataru&#x27;s victory yell after he defeated her in tag. She believed it to be an instant marriage, rather than a proposal, or even just the celebratory shout it really was.

She drinks Tabasco sauce as if it were water and the food she cooks is violently spicy. It does not stop her from trying to prepare edible victuals, and she enjoys preparing food for Ataru, who angers her by refusing to consume it for fear of burning his tongue. Eating umeboshi causes her to get drunk and she dislikes garlic. Despite efforts from everybody she knows to convince her otherwise, her love for Ataru remains unchanged because he has consistently proven that he genuinely cares for her well-being in spite of his idiotic facade. These events have convinced Lum that Ataru is indeed the right man for her. However, while Ataru deeply cares for her, most of their friction stems from their clashing personalities: while Lum is naive and fundamentally innocent, she strives to act as the ideal, mature wife and daughter-in-law for Ataru and his family. On the other hand, Ataru is savvier and well-versed in Earth customs, but he insists to act as a carefree teen, making Lum doubt his commitment.

===Relationship with Ataru===
Lum has fallen completely in love with Ataru, and refers to him only as . Since she considers him to be her husband, she violently electrocutes him whenever he looks at or flirts with another girl (or if he insults her or does something to make her unhappy), but always forgives him in the end (she electrocutes him less frequently as the series progresses). Though Lum knows that Ataru cares deeply for her on the inside, she wishes that he would show it more often than he does. Many of the gadgets she keeps in her UFO and her bikini top are designed to meet this end by making him more faithful to her.

At the beginning of the series, she constantly hugs and kisses Ataru, whether he wants it or not, often infuriating Shinobu (who still initially had feelings for Ataru, though she eventually gave up on him) and the rest of the class. But by the end, Lum has calmed down considerably and simply holds onto his arm whenever they are walking somewhere. She is usually together with Ataru and does almost everything with him, whether eating lunch, going to and from school, or going to a festival. She even enrolled herself in Tomobiki High to spend more time with him, which initially caused her Darling to faint from the shock. Lum has come to consider and treat his room as her home, though Ataru insists she sleeps in the closet. Takahashi&#x27;s reason for this is that she believes two high school students shouldn&#x27;t be sleeping together. Lum did try to get Ataru to sleep with her in early manga chapters and anime episodes (and also spread a rumor that she and Ataru &quot;were&quot; sleeping together and that she was pregnant with his child, which was designed to make Shinobu angry at Ataru), but Ataru flatly refused. In one episode, she does share Ataru&#x27;s bed, but only after fitting him in a bulky insulated suit to protect him from accidental electric shocks in her sleep.

Lum is considered the embodiment of modern Japanese women&#x27;s struggle: how to be independent and still fulfill the traditional role of loving wife and mother. While she is very independent-minded, she continues to be supportive and caring of Ataru no matter what happens throughout the series. Lum&#x27;s relationship with Shinobu was initially very stormy, as Lum considered Shinobu to be Ataru&#x27;s &quot;mistress&quot; and went to extraordinary lengths to disrupt the relationship between Ataru and Shinobu (including using her UFOs to jam Ataru and Shinobu&#x27;s telephone calls and claiming that she was pregnant with Ataru&#x27;s child). Eventually, Shinobu realizes that Ataru really does love Lum and gives up on Ataru (eventually finding love with Inaba), and her and Lum&#x27;s mutual hatred cools down into a somewhat terse friendship, though the two never do become close. Although Lum sees Mendou and Megane and his gang (Lum&#x27;s Stormtroopers) as good friends and values their company, she does not return the affection they have for her, and makes it clear that she loves only her &quot;Darling.&quot;

===Speech===
Lum refers to herself in the first person as , which is a trait of the western Japanese dialects including the Kansai dialect, and is famous for usually ending her sentences with or simply , which is a trait of the Sendai dialect. When used by itself, &quot;daccha&quot; means &quot;Yes&quot;. This speech type is a rather saccharine, &quot;cute&quot; type of speech. A similar speech pattern appears in Takahashi&#x27;s debut work , where the add at the end of all of their sentences.

AnimEigo&#x27;s English dub of the first two episodes of the TV series, &quot;Those Obnoxious Aliens&quot;, attempted to approximate Lum&#x27;s &quot;daccha&quot; speech pattern with &quot;icha,&quot; which in English means nothing. None of the other American- or British-made dubs of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; TV episodes or movies have tried a similar English approximation of &quot;daccha.&quot;

==Reception==

Lum is a well-known and popular character in Japan, and has been described as &quot;the original Otaku dream girl&quot;. On 4 April 1982, Lum and other characters from &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; appeared in two public service announcements for the Kansai Electric Power Company regarding being careful with kites and &quot;koinobori&quot; around electrical lines. Fumi Hirano, the voice actress of Lum, did the main voiceovers for the commercials.

Merchandise featuring Lum continues to be popular, and her image appears on a wide variety of printed, commercial, and electronic media. Over four decades after the character&#x27;s introduction in 1978, pachinko machines featuring Lum are still being made. Lum also appeared wearing a Hanshin Tigers uniform in a series of numbered collector covers of the &quot;Daily Sports&quot; (a daily sports newspaper published in Japan) from 2003 to 2009. Comiket organiser Koichi Ichikawa has described Lum as being both the source of moe and the first tsundere, a character which alternates between being harsh and being loving. Bome, a sculptor of anime-style figurines, felt that Lum was the first female lead character in a work published on a &quot;shōnen&quot; magazine, and was inspired by Lum to create a line of &quot;oni-musume&quot; (she-devil) figurines.

In the 6th edition in 1983 of the Anime Grand Prix, Lum was ranked second place behind Misa Hayase from Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Matthew Sweet introduced many people in the United States to Lum through clips in his music video &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Waiting&quot;. Sweet also has a tattoo of Lum.

<doc id="950821" wikidata="Q183469" url="?curid=950821" title="Juanita M. Kreps">
<text>Clara Juanita Morris Kreps (January 11, 1921July 5, 2010) was an American economist, educator and businesswoman who served as the 24th United States secretary of commerce under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Kreps was the first woman to hold that post and the fourth female ever to serve in a presidential cabinet (alongside simultaneously appointed HUD Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris).

==Early life and career==
Kreps was born Clara Juanita Morris on January 11, 1921, in Lynch, Kentucky. She was the daughter of Cenia (née Blair) and Elmer M. Morris. She graduated from Berea College in 1942, and earned her master&#x27;s and Ph.D. in economics at Duke University in 1944 and 1948, respectively. She was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. A specialist in labor demographics, Kreps taught at Denison University, Hofstra College, Queens College, and Duke. She rose through the ranks there to become the university&#x27;s first female vice president. In 1972 she was the first woman director of the New York Stock Exchange.

On August 11, 1944, she married Clifton Holland Kreps Jr., a former professor at the University of North Carolina. They had two daughters and one son.

Kreps was awarded the 1976 North Carolina Award for public service and 20 honorary degrees. She sat on the board of 10 major corporations. A collection of Kreps&#x27; papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at the Duke University.

Political advisor Anne Wexler, who was serving on the President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s transition team after his victory in the 1976 presidential election, recommended Kreps for a post in the Carter administration. Kreps was appointed to serve as the Secretary of Commerce. She resigned on October 31, 1979. She was replaced by Philip M. Klutznick.

Kreps died on July 5, 2010, in Durham, North Carolina, from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the age of 89. She was buried at the Chapel of the Cross Episcopal Churchyard in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

== Family background ==
Living in Harlan County, Kreps was raised in a part of Kentucky known for its coal mining industry. Coming from a family of mostly farmers on her mother&#x27;s side which continued through her mother&#x27;s adulthood, Kreps&#x27; father was initially an accountant for the coal mining business, later he moved up to be the manager of a small, independent coal mine. When Kreps was young her parents divorced. Her father lived close by to lessen the impact of divorced parents. Kreps had five siblings: one older sister and four brothers. Though her mother continued farming through her adulthood, her father sent monthly alimony payments to help Kreps and her siblings survive.

== Education ==
Around age twelve, Kreps was sent to boarding school at the now defunct Stuart Robinson School joining the class of 1938. Her education was largely paid for by the Presbyterian Church. Teachers at her boarding school came from all over the South and the education she was receiving at the time was highly esteemed. Her high school counselors tried to steer her towards going to Berea College, which was a free institution, or other Presbyterian colleges like Flora McDonald. However, Kreps&#x27; financial situation restricted her from schools with high tuition and made the cheaper options more viable.

Kreps attended Berea College in the late 1930s into the 1940s and Kreps noted that the national atmosphere had changed. Her college days were driven by equality motivated philosophies and the idea that gender and race did not divide anyone intellectually. At Berea, Kreps worked as a dishwasher, a college hospital receptionist, a theater department costume designer and finally as an aide to one of the top Economics professors in the department as a paper grader. Through her connections with Rector Hardin, a professor who had received a Ph.D. from Duke himself, Kreps was able to attend graduate school at Duke University. One of her mentors at Duke was Frank Deviyver. Over the years as student, Kreps helped edit his book and she wrote her dissertation under Deviyver&#x27;s supervision. Kreps attributed her ability to continue her education with less discrimination during her college years because she was not a man. At the time, men were being drafted for war and women were not, which Kreps noted made it more possible for her to teach almost directly after graduating seeing as no men were around to tell her not to. Teaching at this time, Kreps realized most of her students were women with some men scattered here and there.

First meeting her husband in Atlanta while working with the National War Labor Board in 1943, she later reconnected with him while he was also doing his Ph.D. at Duke University. That summer, Kreps and her husband worked as wage analysts who were in charge of trying to stop inflation and ensure that wage increases were not increasing too rapidly.

== Marital teaching career ==
During the mid-1940s, Kreps and her husband had faced many obstacles in terms of managing to match up with their appointments. Both of them managed to get teaching jobs in Ohio but at two different colleges. Their relationship consisted of seeing each other very sparsely and when Kreps&#x27; husband got offered a position in California at Pomona College in 1950, Kreps used this time to herself to finish her dissertation. Eventually the two returned to Ohio for a few years until her husband was offered a position with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York in the mid-1950s and at this point in their life is when children became Kreps&#x27; main focus.

== Working mother in the 1950s ==
During her time as a child bearer, Kreps never maintained a full-time position. During the 1950s, Kreps believed it would be too difficult to juggle the responsibilities of motherhood on top of being part of the full-time labor force. With her time away from full-time appointments, Kreps managed to edit a few books but other than that was very distant from the work force. Kreps&#x27; husband eventually left his position in New York to pursue a position at the University of North Carolina. Knowing that her family was being moved to Chapel Hill, Duke University reached out and offered Kreps a job teaching a few classes. As her children got older, Kreps started to take on more and more responsibility as a professor with Duke and gained entry back into the world of full-time appointment.

As a mother, Kreps was satisfied and grateful for her time away from the workforce. However, as a woman, she did note that her six to eight years away for reproductive leave did stifle her in terms of achievement in comparison to other women around her age. She appreciated the time she got to write while being home for those years.

== Feminist Movement supporter ==
As an early advocate of the feminist movement, Kreps attended events and publicly supported equal opportunity employment on numerous occasions. Through teaching, Kreps was able to try and instill more than just the life of a homemaker and teach all her students that women were entitled to a fulfilling occupation just as much as men were.

Kreps&#x27; appointment to Secretary of Commerce under President Jimmy Carter was a historic moment for the movement. People had been publicly questioning how qualified women were to hold cabinet positions and even the president himself was guilty of making assumptions on the topic. Kreps is very well known for her reaction to this assumption where she told the president &quot;You have to look harder for qualified women.&quot;

While working at Duke University, Kreps was promoted to dean of the Women&#x27;s College. In her time working there, she noticed that after a while the college was faced with too much pressure to combine with the rest of the campus and that women were not particularly inclined to enjoy how segregated from the rest of their own campus they were. At first, Kreps was very cautious of the position since she could visibly see how much more progressive women on the campus were becoming. Though the college did want a new dean, Kreps was very much aware her administration would be marked by the integration of the Woman&#x27;s College into the whole of campus and that her position of leadership at the college would be one of short standing.

Eventually, Kreps resigned from her position as dean in 1972. This decision came for many reasons, but one specific one that she cited in her resignation letter was that she did not want to interfere with the progress that the school was making in terms of integrating the Woman&#x27;s College. She knew that by remaining in her position she would be standing in the way of the basic rebuilding of the undergraduate experience and though it may not have been ideal she knew it was a necessary next step. At this point, Kreps knew she had other aspirations and that the change was coming with or without her. Following this resignation, Kreps returned to teaching Economics and was given the position of Vice President of Duke in 1973 until 1977 just a couple years later. Later she received the James B. Duke Professorship which Kreps was awarded to her for her years of research, publications and professional experience.

== Woman of firsts ==
In addition to being the first female Secretary of Commerce, Kreps also became the first female director of the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. She served on various corporate boards: AT&amp;T, Armco, Chrysler, Citicorp, JCPenney, John Deere, Kodak, RJR Nabisco, UAL Corporation and Zurn Industries. In 1987, Kreps became the first woman to win the Director of the Year award for the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD). Kreps efforts in the boardroom were seen as nothing less than &quot;gold standard&quot;. She believed it was the job of those in the boardrooms to raise awareness by what they chose to discuss: &quot;The trouble isn&#x27;t whether you have the courage to raise the issues. Where you might fall down in your obligation to stockholders is in not knowing enough about what&#x27;s going on to make an intelligent decision.&quot;

== Cabinet appointment ==
Before her appointment in the Carter administration, Kreps had never worked in a government position. During her appointment, Kreps faced numerous issues in terms of adjusting to a government level occupation. Kreps faced budgeting issues and struggled to work with other Cabinet members who did not take her seriously since she was a woman. She also had to manage a good relationship with Congress which was nearly all male. Kreps still felt close to Carter regardless and enjoyed a friendly relationship with the president.

Kreps&#x27; time as a cabinet member was considered different not only because she was a woman but also because no economist had ever before held her cabinet position. However, during the Carter administration, Kreps had started out as a very important contributor to economic policy, and slowly people like the Secretary of the Treasury, the OMB director and the chief economist in the State Department, started to push her out of talks. Kreps attributed this to anti-Commerce Department segregation and later on was relieved to find that she disagreed with many of the decisions made by this small group and was thankful for having been overlooked. By the end, the meetings were inclusive and Kreps was offered virtually unlimited access to Carter, which she saw as good consolation for her peers&#x27; oversight.

Kreps worked heavily on trade issues during her appointment. One of her biggest accomplishments as a cabinet member was noted as the trade agreement with China. The agreement was a public works program and it was started in her first year on the job. Kreps facilitated a successful bill associated with the Arab boycott during her appointment as well. Kreps made it very clear that the U.S. was not particularly savvy in regard to the world economy. To form successful relations with other countries, like Japan, Kreps believed that the U.S. needed to appreciate the other countries for what they were and to stop trying to force free trade on places that have different kinds of governments.

== Policy ==
Kreps wrote a report in 1976 called &quot;Social Security in the Coming Decade:
Questions for a Mature System&quot;. The report examined Social Security as a whole and its feasibility. The report began with a quote that Kreps herself agreed with in regard to Social Security policies: &quot;There is really no way to support retired Americans comfortably and affordably.&quot; The conclusion of the report found that increased interest in where Social Security is going by the general public is what will keep retirement benefits alive. The people must stay invested in knowing where funding for Social Security is coming from and staying vigilant of the number of new people reaching retirement eligibility each year to ensure a working system.

During her time as Secretary of Commerce, Kreps brought proposal to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare which stated that the age for Social Security eligibility must be raised gradually otherwise the benefits will deplete at too quick of a rate. This was immediately followed by a lot of opposition because Americans did not want to have work any longer than they believe was required of them. Her reasoning came from the fact that from her calculations the only way to keep Social Security funds at an adequate level, her solution needed to be implemented over a set course of years. Though her vision came a little bit early, eventually the government did exactly what Kreps suggested in order to save the sanctity of Social Security.

== Cultural depiction ==
Kreps is played by Becky Ann Baker in the 2020 Amazon Studios streaming series &quot;Hunters&quot;.

<text>The 1966 [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL entry draft|amateur draft]] was the fourth NHL entry draft. It was held at the Mount Royal Hotel in Montreal, Quebec on the off-day between games one and two of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals. 

This draft is notable for being the first in which the majority of the players selected (19 of 24 picks) came from top-tier junior teams which would, in the succeeding years, reorganize into Major Junior Hockey in Canada. Perhaps anticipating these changes, and looking to make the draft more competitive in advance of the 1967 NHL expansion, league president Clarence Campbell announced a plan eight months later to restructure rookie contracts and phase out direct sponsorship of junior hockey teams by NHL clubs.

<doc id="950828" wikidata="Q2344846" url="?curid=950828" title="The Telltale Head">
<text>&quot;The Telltale Head&quot; is the eighth episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on February 25, 1990. It was written by Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Sam Simon and Matt Groening, and directed by Rich Moore. In the episode, Bart cuts the head off the statue of Jebediah Springfield in the center of town to impress Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph, three older kids he admires. The town&#x27;s residents, including the three boys, are horrified and Bart regrets his actions. After telling Lisa and Marge, Homer and Bart head to the center of town, where they are met by an angry mob. After Bart tells the mob that he has made a mistake, the townspeople forgive Bart and the boy places the head back on the statue. The episode&#x27;s title and premise is a reference to the 1843 short story &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe.

==Plot==
The episode begins in medias res. On Monday night, Homer and Bart are chased through the streets of Springfield by an angry mob while carrying the head of the statue of their town founder, Jebediah Springfield. Surrounded by the mob, Bart begins to explain the events of the previous day, which starts the episode proper.

After going to church with his family, Bart was forbidden by Marge to see the violent movie &quot;Space Mutants 4&quot;. Later on, he ran into three of Springfield&#x27;s bullies: Jimbo Jones, Kearney Zzyzwicz, and Dolph Starbeam, who invited Bart to sneak into the movie theater to watch &quot;Space Mutants 4&quot;.

After being thrown out of the theater by the manager, the gang shoplifted from the Kwik-E-Mart, owned by store clerk Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, threw rocks at the Jebediah Springfield statue and watch clouds. Bart remarked that one cloud resembles the statue, but without a head. His new friends remarked that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town upset over it. When Bart disagreed, the bullies made fun of him. Bart was conflicted and asked Homer whether it is okay to compromise one&#x27;s beliefs to be popular. Homer told Bart that popularity is very important, as long as it did not involve killing someone. That night, Bart snuck out of the house, and with no witnesses he decapitated the statue.

The town was shaken by the crime, which caused Bart to feel guilty about his action. The act also did not make him popular with Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney, who told Bart they did not actually mean what they said about cutting off the head, and that they would attack the culprit if he were with them. Bart began to fear the consequences were his actions revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue&#x27;s severed head, which began speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confessed to his family, explaining that he thought being popular was the most important thing in the world. Homer realized it was his advice that had caused Bart to commit the crime in the first place, and took responsibility by accompanying Bart as he took the head back to the statue, returning the story to the beginning.

Bart realizes his act has actually brought the town of Springfield closer together, and the mob agrees. The head is then returned to the statue and everyone forgives Homer and Bart. As they are leaving, Homer tells Bart that not all lynch mobs are this nice.

==Production==
The idea to have the episode in flashbacks was originally thought up in the color screening stage of production. This is the first episode directed by Rich Moore. This is the first time Jebediah Springfield is mentioned, as well as the first time the Simpsons go to church. The announcer of the football game Homer is listening to at church is based on Keith Jackson. Two of the football players&#x27; names in the game are Kogen and Wolodarsky, in reference to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writers Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky.

This is the first episode of the series in which Sideshow Bob, Reverend Lovejoy, Krusty the Clown, Jimbo Jones, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Dolph Starbeam, Ms. Albright, and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon appear. Bart awakening and finding the head of Jebediah Springfield in bed next to him is a reference to the scene in &quot;The Godfather&quot; where Jack Woltz finds the bloody severed head of his prize racehorse next to him one morning.

Outside of the Treehouse of Horror specials, this is one of only three episodes to actually show the title on screen (the others being season two&#x27;s &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot; and season seven&#x27;s &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;).

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; finished twenty-sixth in ratings for the week of February 19–25, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 15.2, equivalent to approximately 14.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on Fox that week, following &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said they enjoyed: &quot;the Simpsons [being] grossly dysfunctional in church, Homer dispensing terrible advice, and a real moral dilemma for Bart.&quot; In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated this episode a 3 (of 5) and added, &quot;This is a strange episode, touching on many bizarre aspects of the show to come.&quot; Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said, &quot;Good little moments abounded, and this was a generally solid episode. I liked the objects the boys saw in the clouds, and quite a few other funny bits appeared. ‘Telltale’ wasn&#x27;t a great episode, but it was generally entertaining and clever.&quot;

<text>The Chari River, or Shari River, is a long river, flowing in Central Africa. It is Lake Chad&#x27;s main source of water.

==Geography==
The Chari River flows from the Central African Republic through Chad into Lake Chad, following the Cameroon border from N&#x27;Djamena, where it is joined by its western and principal tributary, the Logone River.

It provides 90 percent of the water flowing into Lake Chad. The watershed of the river covers . The principal tributary is the Logone River, while minor tributaries include the Bahr Salamat, Bahr Sah, Bahr Aouk and Bahr Kéita.

Much of Chad&#x27;s population, including Sarh and the capital N&#x27;Djamena, is concentrated around it.

As of 2016, Chad remains one of four countries where Guinea worm disease remains endemic. The majority of remaining cases are concentrated around the Chari River.

The river supports an important local fishing industry. One of the most highly prized local fish is the Nile perch.

Since the 1960s, there have been proposals to divert water from the Ubangi River to the Chari to revitalize Lake Chad, which would constitute a reversal of the capture of the upper Ubangi from the Chari by the Congo River that is believed to have occurred in the early Pleistocene.

== History ==
The Sao people are said to have lived by this river.

The Chari River basin has been populated by diverse speakers of the Chadic languages, Adamawa languages, Ubangian languages, Bongo-Bagirmi languages.

<doc id="950840" wikidata="Q3512107" url="?curid=950840" title="Roseolovirus">
<text>Roseolovirus is a genus of viruses in the order &quot;Herpesvirales&quot;, in the family &quot;Herpesviridae&quot;, in the subfamily &quot;Betaherpesvirinae&quot;. There are currently six species in this genus. Diseases associated with this genus include: HHV-6: sixth disease (roseola infantum, exanthema subitum); HHV-7: symptoms analog to the &#x27;sixth disease&#x27;.

== Species ==
The genus consists of the following six species:

* &quot;Roseolovirus humanbeta7&quot;
* &quot;Roseolovirus humanbeta6a&quot;
* &quot;Roseolovirus humanbeta6b&quot;
* &quot;Roseolovirus macacinebeta9&quot;
* &quot;Roseolovirus muridbeta3&quot;
* &quot;Roseolovirus suidbeta2&quot;
== Structure ==
Viruses in &quot;Roseolovirus&quot; are enveloped, with icosahedral, spherical to pleomorphic, and round geometries, and T=16 symmetry. The diameter is around 150-200 nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 200kb in length.

== Life cycle ==
Viral replication is nuclear, and is lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model. DNA-templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism, is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear egress, and budding.
Humans serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are direct contact and respiratory.

== Diseases ==
&quot;Human herpesvirus 6&quot; (HHV-6) is a set of two closely related herpes viruses known as HHV-6A and HHV-6B that infect nearly all human beings, typically before the age of two. The acquisition of HHV-6 in infancy is often symptomatic, resulting in childhood fever, diarrhea, and exanthem subitum rash (commonly known as roseola). Although rare, this initial infection can also cause febrile seizures, encephalitis or intractable seizures.

Like the other herpesviruses (Epstein–Barr virus, &quot;Human alphaherpesvirus 3&quot;, etc.), HHV-6 establishes lifelong latency and can become reactivated later in life. This reactivation has been associated with many clinical manifestations. Reactivation can occur in locations throughout the body, including the brain, lungs, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. In some cases, HHV-6 reactivation in the brain tissue can cause cognitive dysfunction, permanent disability and death.

A growing number of studies also suggest that HHV-6 may play a role in a subset of patients with chronic neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, status epilepticus and chronic fatigue syndrome.

<text>Alan Edward Nourse (; August 11, 1928 – July 19, 1992) was an American science fiction writer and physician. He wrote both juvenile and adult science fiction, as well as nonfiction works about medicine and science. His SF works sometimes focused on medicine and/or psionics.

His most notable pen name was Doctor X. He used this pseudonym when writing for a medical column in a science fiction magazine, allowing him to combine his expertise in medicine with his passion for science fiction.

==Biography==
Alan Nourse was born August 11, 1928, to Benjamin and Grace (Ogg) Nourse in Des Moines, Iowa. He attended high school in Long Island, New York. He served in the U.S. Navy after World War II. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1951 from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He married Ann Morton on June 11, 1952, in Linden, New Jersey. He received a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in 1955 from the University of Pennsylvania. He served his one-year internship at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle and practiced medicine in North Bend, Washington, from 1958 to 1963 and also pursued his writing career.

He had helped pay for his medical education by writing science fiction for magazines. After retiring from medicine, he continued writing. His regular column in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine earned him the nickname &quot;Family Doctor&quot;.

He was a friend of fellow author Avram Davidson. Robert A. Heinlein dedicated his 1964 novel &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot; to Nourse. Heinlein in part dedicated his 1982 novel &quot;Friday&quot; to Nourse&#x27;s wife Ann.

His novel &quot;The Bladerunner&quot; lent its name to the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; movie, but no other aspects of its plot or characters (which were taken from Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;). In the late 1970s an attempt to adapt &quot;The Bladerunner&quot; for the screen was made, with Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs commissioned to write a story treatment; no film was ever developed but the story treatment was later published as the novella &quot;Blade Runner (a movie)&quot;.

Nourse died of unknown causes on July 19, 1992, in Thorp, Washington.

<text>Manfred Fritz Bukofzer (27 March 1910 – 7 December 1955) was a German-born American musicologist.

==Life and career==
He studied at Heidelberg University and the Stern conservatory in Berlin, but left Germany in 1933 for Switzerland, where he obtained a doctorate from the University of Basel in 1936. In 1939 he moved to the United States where he remained, becoming a U.S. citizen. He taught at the University of California, Berkeley from 1941 until his premature death from multiple myeloma.

Bukofzer is best known as a historian of early music, particularly of the Baroque era. His book &quot;Music in the Baroque Era&quot; is still one of the standard reference works on the topic, although some modern historians assert that it has a Germanic bias – for example, in minimizing the importance of opera (Italian by origin) during the development of musical style in the 17th century.

In addition to Baroque music, he was a specialist in English music and music theory of the 14th through 16th centuries. His other scholarly interests included jazz and ethnomusicology. Furthermore, during his time at Berkeley, Bukofzer conducted several successful operas, including &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, and &quot;Village Barber&quot;.

Among his influential students was Leonard Ratner. He was married to Ilse Kämmerer.

<text>Golden Gardens Park is a public park in Ballard, a neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The park includes wetlands, beaches, hiking trails, and picnic and playground areas. The park&#x27;s bathhouse was designated a historic landmark by the City of Seattle in 2005.

==Landmarks==
The park&#x27;s bathhouse was designated a historic landmark by the City of Seattle in 2005.

== Recreation ==
The lower portion of the park is divided between wetland marsh and beach (on Puget Sound), and situated north of the Shilshole Bay Marina. It also has dunes and large grassy areas. Golden Gardens has exceptional views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains across the sound.
The water is very cold for swimming even in summers. Sailing, kayaking, and canoeing are popular. Kitesurfing and sailboarding and other wind-driven sports are also common. The Sound is cut off from the open ocean for more than a hundred miles, sheltering the park from severe weather.

The park is also host to fire pits, picnic areas, a play area, a basketball court, and walking and hiking paths.

==Nature==
Golden Gardens is well known for the birds that live or migrate there:
* Mallard ducks in the wetlands
* Red-winged blackbirds in the marshes
* Canada geese are seen in the parking lot and near picnic areas
* Wood ducks make occasional appearances
* Bald Eagles commonly occur here
* Glaucous-winged Gulls are common
* Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds can often be seen on the trees near the ponds.
The mallards and Canada geese are habituated to humans, and have been known to attack visitors.
California sea lions are often heard, and Harbor Seals are also commonly seen.
Red-eared slider turtles can be seen sunning themselves on the logs in the ponds.
Beavers are active at the ponds, they have cut down a lot of the alder trees around the ponds.
Musk rats can often be seen swimming in the ponds. Orcas sometimes swim near the beach.

== Motorsport ==

The double switchback road that leads up from Golden Gardens Park was used as a special Seattle demonstration stage for the 1987 Olympus Pro Rally. Cars were staged from the Shilshole Bay Marina parking area (Seaview Avenue) and finished at the top of the ridge on Golden Gardens Drive. The demonstration stage was the opening chapter in the Olympus Rally&#x27;s international campaign to achieve FIA World Rally Championship status for the rally. Olympus was added to the FIA Rally Championship calendar in 1986 as the United States sole World Championship Rally event. It is the only professional rally stage and the only professional motor sport event ever held within the city limits of Seattle.

<doc id="950880" wikidata="Q5310326" url="?curid=950880" title="Duane Elgin">
<text>Duane Elgin (born 1943) is an American author, speaker, educator, consultant, and media activist.

==Early life and education==

Duane Elgin grew up near Wilder, Idaho. He attended the Sorbonne in Paris for one semester in 1963 and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the College of Idaho in 1966. He received a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 and a Master of Arts in economic history from the University of Pennsylvania in 1969.

==Career==
In the early 1970s, Elgin was a senior staff member on a joint Presidential-Congressional Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. The commission&#x27;s task was to look ahead from 1970 to 2000 and explore challenges of urbanization and population growth.

Elgin moved to California, where he worked as a senior social scientist with the &quot;futures group&quot; at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) and co-authored studies of the long-range future. His report on &quot;Voluntary Simplicity&quot;, co-authored with Arnold Mitchell, was published by SRI in June 1976. The report was expanded and republished with a survey in CoEvolution Quarterly in 1977. More than a thousand pages were received in response to the survey. These first-hand accounts formed the basis for his book &quot;Voluntary Simplicity&quot;, which appeared in 1981. Elgin left SRI International in 1977.

During the 1980s, he co-founded two non-profit non-partisan organizations concerned with media accountability and citizen empowerment. The national one was called &quot;Choosing Our Future&quot; and the San Francisco Bay Area organization was called &quot;Bay Voice&quot;. Their mission was to give citizens a greater voice in their community by using the public airwaves for interactive &quot;electronic town meetings&quot;. Elgin continues to promote citizen use of mass media for dialogue about the future. In 2012, Elgin and a small team launched Great Transition Stories, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping people understand ongoing societal transitions.

==Media activism==

Over the past thirty years, Duane Elgin has co-founded two non-profit organizations dedicated to the promotion of media accountability. In 1981, he co-founded &quot;Choosing Our Future&quot; (COF), a national organization with members in 26 states. COF objected to the renewal of licenses of all the major broadcast TV stations in the San Francisco Bay Area on the grounds they were not serving the communication needs of citizens. After the FCC sided with broadcasters and renewed their licenses, Choosing Our Future then created an inclusive &quot;community voice&quot; organization called &quot;Bay Voice&quot;.

In 1987, these organizations put an interactive Electronic Town Meeting (ETM) on the air in the Bay Area during prime-time, working with the local ABC television station. The &quot;ETM&quot; was seen by over 300,000 people and six votes were taken from a pre-selected, random sample of Bay Area citizens. Elgin has written extensively on themes of media and democracy since the 1980s.

==Awards and honors==

In 1999, a group of roughly 30 &#x27;evolutionary leaders&#x27; met with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India over a period of five days to explore &quot;Synthesis Dialogues&quot; and themes of the new paradigm and building a sustainable and a spiritual future for humanity. In 2001 Elgin was awarded an honorary PhD for work in &quot;ecological and spiritual transformation&quot; from the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) in San Francisco. He is also a member of the CIIS &quot;Council of Sages&quot;. In 2006 Elgin received the annual Goi International Peace Award in Japan in recognition of his contribution to a global &quot;vision, consciousness, and lifestyle&quot; that fosters a &quot;more sustainable and spiritual culture&quot;.

Elgin has been a visiting scholar at Denison University in Ohio in May, 2004 (for a 5-day workshop on theme of &quot;Simplicity and Envisioning a Positive Future&quot;). He has also been a &#x27;distinguished scholar&#x27; at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida in 2012 where he spoke to both public and student audiences about our time of &quot;great transition&quot;. Duane Elgin was described in April 2009 by the &quot;Ecologist Magazine&quot; as one of the ten leading visionaries with &quot;big ideas for a better world&quot;.

<doc id="950883" wikidata="Q226008" url="?curid=950883" title="Japanese idol">
<text>An is a type of entertainer marketed for image, attractiveness, and personality in Japanese pop culture. Idols are primarily singers with training in other performance skills such as acting, dancing, and modeling. Idols are commercialized through merchandise and endorsements by talent agencies, while maintaining a parasocial relationship with a financially loyal consumer fan base.

Japan&#x27;s idol industry first emerged in the 1960s and became prominent in the 1970s and 1980s due to television. During the 1980s, regarded as the &quot;Golden Age of Idols&quot;, idols drew in commercial interest and began appearing in commercials and television dramas. As more niche markets began to appear in the late 2000s and early 2010s, it led to a significant growth in the industry known as the &quot;Idol Warring Period.&quot; Today, over 10,000 teenage girls in Japan are idols, with over 3,000 groups active. Japan&#x27;s idol industry has been used as a model for other pop idol industries, such as K-pop.

Sub-categories of idols include gravure idols, junior idols, net idols, idol voice actors, virtual idols, AV idols, alternative idols, underground idols, idols, local idols, bandols, and Japanese-South Korean idols.

An idol is a type of entertainer whose image is manufactured to cultivate a dedicated consumer fan following. Talent agencies commercialize idols by recruiting preteens and teenagers with little or no experience in the entertainment industry, and market them as aspiring stars. Idols are marketed for their image, attractiveness, and personalities. An idol&#x27;s main objective is to &quot;sell dreams&quot;, offering fans a form of escapism from the troubles of daily life. Idols are predominantly singers, but are also often trained in acting, dancing, and modeling. This style of recruiting and training was pioneered by Johnny Kitagawa, the founder of Johnny &amp; Associates, and has since been used in other pop idol industries such as Korean idols in K-pop.

Idols often spend time isolated from family and friends while enduring busy work schedules, with some agencies withholding job assignments from their talents and notifying them of work on short notice to prevent them from taking time off. Some talent agencies do not rigorously train their idols and market them as amateurs who will gain experience over the course of their careers and with support from their fans. Despite being trained in multiple roles in entertainment, idols in Japan are not expected to meet the high standards of performances that professionals in their fields do. Because of their manufactured image, idols are generally not regarded as authentic artists. Likewise, many young Japanese artists pursuing careers in acting or music reject the idol label in their bid to be seen as professionals.

Music from idol singers is generally categorized under J-pop, though talent agencies may label them under the sub-genre &quot;idol pop&quot; for further distinction. Many idol singers find success as groups rather than individually. Within each idol group, the members are sometimes given distinct roles. One example of a role is the center, who occupies the center position in the group&#x27;s choreography and thus receives the most focus. Another example is the leader, usually relegated to the oldest or most experienced member in the group, who acts as an intermediary for the members and the staff.

===Public image===

Idols are seen as role models to the public, and their personal lives and image can sometimes be tightly controlled by their talent agencies. Common restrictions include not being allowed to smoke or drink in public, or pursue romantic relationships.

===Outfits===
Idols generally perform in elaborate costumes for specific performances. Costumes are created for each song in their promotion cycle, as well as graduation events, and some groups have their own in-house costume designer. AKB48, in particular, has had over 1,102 costumes created for the group since 2017. The outfits worn by female idols are generally described as &quot;cute&quot;, while outfits worn by male idols are described as &quot;cool.&quot;

Among many idol groups, school uniforms have been used as a standard costume. The integration of school uniforms in the idol industry originated from Onyanko Club, who debuted in 1985 with a concept based on school. Following their disbandment in 1987, other groups began adopting school uniforms as costumes, such as CoCo and Ribbon, two groups put together by Fuji TV&#x27;s audition programs, followed by in 1992 and Morning Musume in the early 2000s. When AKB48 debuted in 2006, the group used a school concept and the members have performed in various stylized costumes based on school uniforms. Since then, other groups have used stylized school uniforms as costumes, such as AKB48&#x27;s sister groups, Sakura Gakuin, and Sakurazaka46, with some modifications to suit the groups&#x27; image and choreography.

In 2017, &quot;Nihon Tarento Meikan&quot; noted that stylized school uniforms being used as costumes gained popularity through AKB48 due to their unique designs, the short skirts, and the neatness of the uniform. The uniforms found popularity with men, as they represent their &quot;eternal longing&quot; and nostalgia for high school, while only gaining popularity with women in the 2010s through anime.

===Retirement===

Idols are typically expected to change careers after aging out of the industry, with female idols typically changing careers at age 25 and male idols at ages 30–45. Idols who leave a group are often given a farewell concert known as . The term originated from the idol group Onyanko Club, as the group&#x27;s youthful concept drew similarities to an after-school club, and the fact that Miharu Nakajima&#x27;s final single before retirement was released around graduation season in Japan. Prior to the 1980s, the terms &quot;retirement&quot; and &quot;disbandment&quot; were used. &quot;Graduation&quot; saw usage again in the 1990s during the revival of idol groups when Tsunku, who produced the group Morning Musume, used the term as a euphemism regarding one of the members leaving the group. An idol having a &quot;graduation&quot; ceremony is seen more favorably than terminating a contract or voluntarily withdrawing, as the latter two terms are negatively connoted with scandals.

==Sub-category markets==
The diversity of Japan&#x27;s idol industry has created several sub-category markets, each with a specific concept appealing to certain audiences.
* : AV (adult video) idols generally refer to pornographic actresses and models, with the industry first emerging in the 1980s.
* : Bandols are idol groups that play instruments and perform as bands. The term first emerged in the 2000s as a shortening of the phrase, , which was used to describe the marketing concept of the band Zone.
* : Gravure idols are models who pose in provocative swimsuit and lingerie photographs in magazines and photo books marketed towards men, similar to pin-up models. In the 1970s, Agnes Lum, who rose to fame in Japan, is considered the first gravure idol despite the term not existing at the time. Other notable swimsuit models were , , and Fumie Hosokawa. After Akiko Hinagata became a rising star in 1995, the term &quot;gravure idol&quot; was coined to describe her. In the 2000s, there was a significant growth in the gravure idol industry, with many women of different body types modeling. This led to sub-category markets in the gravure idol industry to describe their aesthetic and body types, which included , , , , and . The gravure idol industry faced a decline in 2010 due to the popularity of AKB48, as some of their members also did gravure modeling; as a result, the demand for newer talents was reduced.

* : Since the 1970s, several voice actors of anime and video games also held successful singing careers in addition to voice acting. Early examples of voice actors who had an idol-like presence were &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; voice actors Toshio Furukawa and Toru Furuya in the 1970s, who gained a sizeable female following after forming their band, Slapstick. In the 1980s, idol singer Noriko Hidaka eventually became a voice actress after gaining recognition for playing lead in &quot;Touch&quot;. Beginning in the 1990s, several voice actors held successful concurrent singing careers alongside of voice acting, such as Hekiru Shiina, Mariko Kouda, and Megumi Hayashibara. As the anime industry began producing more late-night series in the 2000s, the term &quot;idol voice actor&quot; was popularized when more voice actors with a cultivated fan following began appearing on television. While previous examples involved voice actors who incidentally drew in fans through their singing careers or former idol singers who turned to voice acting, Yui Horie, Yukari Tamura, and Nana Mizuki were intentionally produced and marketed as idol voice actors by their record labels. Around the time when the Idol Warring Period was occurring during the mid-to-late 2000s, there was a significant boom in idols voice acting in anime, with &quot;Oricon&quot; naming Aya Hirano and Koharu Kusumi as examples, as both of them were established actresses and singers in mainstream Japanese entertainment before entering voice acting. Hirano, in particular, was strongly marketed as an idol at the height of her voice acting career, from the late 2000s to the early 2010s. While character song tie-ins were already common in the film industry by then, some voice actors also began making crossover television, stage, and concert appearances as their characters as well, leading them to be closely associated with one another.
* : While Japan and South Korea agencies have created collaborative idol groups in the past, with Route 0 in 2002, during the third Korean wave in the mid-to-late 2010s, the term saw usage again to refer to collaborative idol groups promoting primarily in Japan, but with music, styling, marketing, and presentation produced in the K-pop industry. The earliest example is Iz*One in 2018, followed by JO1 in 2019 and NiziU in 2020.

* : Male idols contracted to Johnny &amp; Associates are nicknamed &quot;Johnny&#x27;s idols&quot; by the media and include groups such as SMAP and Arashi, who have led strong careers both individually and as a group. Since the company was founded in 1962 by Johnny Kitagawa, who is credited for pioneering the idol trainee system and popularizing the performance aspect of modern idols, the company has held a monopoly over the male idol industry in Japan, with Kitagawa pressuring the media to reduce coverage on male idols from other companies until his death in 2019. Johnny&#x27;s idols also rarely get negative press such as scandals due to Kitagawa&#x27;s influence on the media.
* : Junior idols are singers and gravure models who generally are 15 years old and younger. Junior models first grew in popularity in 1995, when child magazine models became popular for their youthfulness and innocence, beginning with the elementary school girls featured in the covers of the magazine &quot;Panja&quot;. In addition, in 1997, the magazine &quot;Nicola&quot; was launched, featuring elementary and middle school girls as their core demographic. At the center of the phenomenon&#x27;s popularity were Sayaka Yoshino and Yuka Nomura, child actresses and models who became popular in Japanese media. In the following years, it led to what the media named the , with the term &quot;chidol&quot; (a combination of the words &quot;child&quot; and &quot;idol&quot;) coined by journalist Akio Nakamori in the magazine &quot;Weekly Spa!&quot; in 1999. In the 2000s, &quot;chidol&quot; saw fewer usage, and it was eventually replaced by the term &quot;junior idol&quot; to legitimize them as part of the idol industry as well as removing the focus on their age. While the industry is still considered legal in Japan, it has been criticized for sexual exploitation of minors. Many junior idol distributors closed after possession of child pornography was outlawed in Japan in 2014.

* : Also written as and or shortened as , local idols primarily promote in rural areas in their specific communities, where accessibility to celebrities is limited. The emergence of local idols was traced back to the early 2000s with Perfume and Negicco. The &quot;Idol Warring Period&quot; in the 2010s led to an increase in the number of local idols, with the 2013 television drama &quot;Amachan&quot; inspiring an accelerated growth. Journalist Mamoru Onoda estimates there are approximately 2,000 local idols active as of 2021. Most of the local idol groups are independently managed, relying on popularity through word-of-mouth. Several local idol groups who have crossed into mainstream media in the 2010s are Rev. from DVL and Dorothy Little Happy, the former after a photo of then-member Kanna Hashimoto went viral on the Internet.
* : Net idols are Internet celebrities who emerged with the accessibility of the Internet in the 1990s, using self-made websites and blogs to discuss their daily lives. Net idols currently conduct the majority of their activities through video streaming websites and social media beginning in the 2000s. Around March 2007, dance covers (known as ) became popular in video-sharing websites such as Niconico, which in turn led people into performing choreographed dances from anime series and idol groups. Notable creators of dance covers, known as , who later debuted as idols include from Danceroid and Dempagumi.inc, Beckii Cruel, and Keekihime.
* : Virtual idols are digital avatars representing a fictional character or persona. The first fictional idol gaining mainstream crossover was Lynn Minmay from &quot;Macross&quot; in the 1980s. In 1997, Kyoko Date was created as the first virtual idol. In 2007, Crypton Future Media released Hatsune Miku as its latest addition to the Vocaloid software, who subsequently saw positive reception from amateur songwriters, with her character and music based on user-generated content. Virtual online streamer Kizuna AI, who first appeared in 2016, led to a boom of Virtual YouTubers who similarly conduct their activities through a digital avatar on YouTube and other streaming websites.

* : Underground idols are independently managed idols who perform at small venues. They are also known as or . Underground idols first emerged in the 1990s when idol groups with large numbers of members began appearing after the popularity of Onyanko Club. Tama Himeno and Kamen Joshi member Tomoka Igari, both underground idols, describe them as being different from mainstream idols (nicknamed ) in that underground idols are active through live performances rather than through exposure from mass media or CD releases through major record labels, thus making them more accessible to fans in comparison to mainstream idols. An example Igari used to describe close relationships that underground idols have with their fans is that underground idols will hold handshake events and take instant camera photos (known as ) with fans after every live performance.
** : idols are type of underground idol based in the Akihabara district of Tokyo, drawing influences from its culture. Music from idols are generally sold as self-published CDs at Comiket or promoted through Niconico. is a dedicated venue where they perform. While idols are niche, Haruko Momoi and Dempagumi.inc are cited as an examples of an idols crossing over to mainstream media. Dempagumi.inc&#x27;s music producer, Maiko Fukushima, describes the music from idols as distinct from anime songs, with most composers being &quot;amateurs&quot; and its organic music culture facing a state of the Galapagos syndrome, as they had no direct creative input from J-pop or other music genres. However, Fukushima noted that songs from R-18 games were also key components of music. In 2007, Vocaloid greatly influenced the growth of music and idol culture. AKB48, one of Japan&#x27;s most recognized idol groups nationwide, originated from Akihabara, but it is not considered an group.
** Alternative idols: Alternative idols, also known as alt-idols or anti-idols, is a term coined by English-speaking communities to describe idol singers that have an image concept and music different from what is considered mainstream, such as having darker images and alternative rock. The alternative idol scene was pioneered by Bis and Seiko Oomori and made popular by Bis&#x27; successor Bish.

==History==

===1960–1980: Post-war era and idol beginnings===
The popularity of young female singers can be traced back to Sayuri Yoshinaga in the 1960s, as well as the Takarazuka Revue and theater shows from the Meiji era. In 1962, Johnny Kitagawa founded Johnny &amp; Associates and created the group Johnnys, which is retroactively considered the first idol group in Japan. He is also credited with pioneering the idol trainee system, where talents would be accepted in the agency at a young age and train not only in singing, but also dancing and acting, until they were ready for debut. However, the concept of an idol was not defined by mainstream Japanese media until in November 1964, when the 1963 French film &quot;Cherchez l&#x27;idole&quot; was released in Japan under the title . Many Japanese audiences took interest in Sylvie Vartan, whose song &quot;La plus belle pour aller danser&quot; from the film sold more than a million copies in Japan. Vartan was heralded for her youthful, adorable looks and musical talent, leading the Japanese entertainment industry to assign the word &quot;idol&quot; to singers who shared a similar aesthetic.

Television greatly impacted the popularity of the idol phenomenon, as beginning in the 1970s, many idols were recruited through audition programs. In addition, the availability of having home television sets gave audiences greater accessibility of seeing idols at any time compared to going to theaters. Momoe Yamaguchi, Junko Sakurada, Saori Minami, and Mari Amachi, some of the idols recruited through television, were some of the more popular figures of this era, along with groups such as Candies and Pink Lady. Saori Minami, who debuted in 1971, was noted by scholar Masayoshi Sakai to be the turning point of when teenage stars became popular in mainstream media. Music was produced by a shared climate of songwriters and art directors seeking a step towards a depoliticized youth culture. Idols grew in popularity over the 1970s, as they offered audiences escapism from political violence and radical student movements.

Idols at the time were seen as ephemeral because of how short-lived their careers were, and how they would disappear from the public after retirement. In public, idols took steps to play a distinct character and uphold an illusion of perfection, such as maintaining a virginal image. Other examples include being told not to use restrooms in public and answering interview questions about their favorite food with feminine-sounding answers such as &quot;strawberries&quot; and &quot;shortcake.&quot;

=== 1980–1990: Golden Age of Idols ===
The influence idols had on television led the 1980s to be known as the &quot;Golden Age of Idols&quot;, in part due to Japan&#x27;s economic bubble and growing commercial interest in them. Several figures who defined the Golden Age of Idols are Seiko Matsuda, Akina Nakamori, Kyōko Koizumi, and Onyanko Club. Television programs in which idols appeared often enjoyed high viewer ratings. Dentsu also created the &quot;CM idol&quot; business model, where idols were able to gain fame by singing and appearing in commercials.

Onyanko Club, in particular, shifted public perception of idols from professional stars to ordinary schoolgirls who would gain experience throughout their career. They were also the first group to introduce a &quot;graduation system&quot;, where older members would eventually leave the group while newer inexperienced members would join, with the system being named such as the group drew similarities to a school club. Onyanko Club also led to idols becoming closely associated with television due to the popularity of their variety show, as the visual component became important to the overall enjoyment of their music.

At the same time, male idols gained popularity, with acts from Johnny &amp; Associates normalizing idols singing and dancing at the same time. However, fewer male idol acts from other companies achieved the same success as Johnny&#x27;s idols due to the company&#x27;s CEO, Johnny Kitagawa, controlling the media and pressuring certain programs not to invite male idols from competing agencies, as he would continue to until his death in 2019.

===1990–2000: Idol Winter Period and Chidol Boom===
Around 1985, idols soon became unpopular after the public became disillusioned with the idol system. By the 1990s, public interest in idols began to wane, as audiences lost interest in singing and audition programs, particularly due to a shift in attitudes caused by Japan&#x27;s economic collapse. The media coined the term to describe the stagnation of the idol industry beginning in 1990.

More young people yielded aspirations to be defined as an artist instead of an idol. During this decline, public perception of idols again shifted from inexperienced amateurs to strong, independent women, in part due to a rehaul in Seiko Matsuda&#x27;s public image. Namie Amuro, who gained fame as the lead singer of Super Monkey&#x27;s, found popularity among young girls who emulated her appearance. At the same time, Speed also found a fan following. However, neither Amuro nor Speed referred to themselves under the idol label. While idols appeared less in mainstream media, the popularity of Onyanko Club from the 1980s led to an increase of idol groups with large numbers of members debuting in the 1990s, performing under independent record labels. These idols became known as underground idols. Because of the lack of publicity over idols on television, many turned to the Internet.

Johnny &amp; Associates observed the popularity of former Shibugakitai member Hirohide Yakumaru&#x27;s success as an MC on variety shows, which prompted them to develop and market their current acts with distinct public personalities. Groups from the company began gaining more attention, drawing in fans from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and their marketing success led to many other idols doing the same.

In the mid-1990s, there was an increase in young idols in the elementary school age, which the media described as the &quot;Chidol (child idol) Boom.&quot; The term &quot;chidol&quot; was coined by journalist Akio Nakamori in the magazine &quot;Weekly Spa!&quot; In the 2000s, &quot;chidol&quot; saw fewer usage, and it was eventually replaced by the term &quot;junior idol&quot; to legitimize them as part of the idol industry as well as removing the focus on their age.

===2000–present: Media crossovers and Idol Warring Period===

The 2000s saw the rise in popularity of idol groups again after Morning Musume&#x27;s debut in 1997 and the formation of their musical collective, Hello! Project. Around the same time, there was an increase in gravure idols, who competed in magazine and photo book sales. In addition, anime voice actors, such as Yui Horie, Nana Mizuki, and Yukari Tamura, were also marketed as idols to promote both their activities and singing careers.

While idols briefly experienced another decline after 2002, AKB48 debuted in 2005 and later became known as nation&#x27;s idol group. The public image of idols had diversified, with each idol group having a specific concept appealing to different audiences. To celebrate the diversity of idols, AKB48, Shoko Nakagawa, and Leah Dizon performed a medley called &quot;Special Medley: Latest Japan Proud Culture&quot; at the 58th Kohaku Uta Gassen in 2007, introduced as &quot; idols&quot; with each act described as a different sub-genre of idols.

The idol industry experienced a rapid growth in the beginning of the 2010s, and the media coined the nickname to describe the phenomenon. Lawyer Kunitaka Kasai cited the Internet as a reason for the rapid growth of idols, as anyone can upload videos onto websites, and AKB48&#x27;s business model encouraged this even further through creating more opportunities for fan interactivity. The 2013 television drama &quot;Amachan&quot; also inspired more idol groups to appear, the majority of them being &quot;local idols&quot; who performed in specific rural communities. Several independent idol groups also crossed over into mainstream, such as Dempagumi.inc, Dorothy Little Happy, and Rev. from DVL, the latter of which gained mainstream popularity after a photo of then-member Kanna Hashimoto went viral.

Since 2010, the biggest idol concert festival, Tokyo Idol Festival, has taken place. More than 200 idol groups and about 1500 idols performed, attracting more than 80,000 spectators in 2017. During 2014, about 486,000 people attended AKB48 and Momoiro Clover Z&#x27;s live concerts, which was the highest record of all female musicians in Japan. Momoiro Clover Z has been ranked as the most popular female idol group from 2013 to 2017 according to surveys by &quot;The Nikkei&quot;, There were more than 10,000 teenage girls who performed as idols in Japan in 2017. In 2019, there were over 3,000 female idol groups.

From 2013 to 2018, boy band Arashi was ranked as the most popular artist overall in Japan according to Oricon polls of 20,000 people. Other male idols also found success as underground idols, as well as anime media mix projects and 2.5D musicals.

In the early 2010s, the diversification of the idol industry led to several acts mixing pop music with other musical genres such as alternative rock and heavy metal; this was pioneered by Bis and Seiko Oomori and was given the sub-category &quot;alternative idol&quot; by English-speaking publications. They have also been known for utilising shock value to gain public and media attention and making use of a darker image than that of the idol scene norm.

Beginning in the mid-to-late 2010s, the Japanese idol industry crossed over with K-pop with the third Korean wave in Japan, which was sparked partially from positive reception of the Japanese members of the South Korean group Twice. In the years that followed, several Japanese and South Korean companies collaborated to form K-pop influenced groups for a global consumer base, such as Iz*One, JO1, and NiziU.

==Fan culture==

===Fan activities===

Passionate male fans of idols are colloquially referred to as , derived from the word &quot;.&quot; Beginning in the 1980s, they formed cheering groups known as to support idols at concerts and public appearances. During these events, the perform , an organized sequence of fan chants and dancing to show appreciation for the idols. Fan chants where an idol&#x27;s name is called after each bar is sung was popularized by Mari Amachi&#x27;s fans in the 1970s.

Because mainstream Japanese media exercises self-censorship over taboo, controversial subjects, fans are influential in circulating under-reported news through social media.

Idol fan culture has introduced several slang terms into the Japanese public, including:

* DD, an abbreviation for , applying to people who do not have a favorite member or group. The term has negative connotations. Writer Riyan suggests that while there are fans with no favorite members or groups, they are not likely to identify themselves as DD. A variation of DD is the word , which indicates support for an idol group.
* , also shortened to , is a favorite member or group

===Fan interactions===
A notable trait of idols that sets them apart from typical celebrities is their relationship with fans, and they are marketed intentionally by talent agencies to have a high emotional connection with their consumer fan base. Fans are built as active supporters into the narrative of the idol&#x27;s journey to become a professional entertainer, viewing them as siblings, daughters/sons, or girl/boy next door types due to how easily they can relate to the public. One documented example are fans of female idols, typically consisting of men from 30 to 40 years of age, who seek interactions with them as a way of having a long-term relationship without the prospect of supporting a family or dealing with awkwardness outside of a controlled environment. The idol fan culture idealizes the idea of , where vulnerability is seen as an attractive trait.

Using idols from Johnny &amp; Associates as an example, male idols appeal to female fans by representing a pseudo-romantic ideal for them. However, there are some female fans, particularly in Japan, who prefer to put themselves in the role of an external observer. For them, the absence of other women is a way of watching the male idols interact with one another and imagining their interactions to be similar to .

Fans spend money on merchandise and endorsed products to directly support their favorites, comparing it to spending money on &quot;loved ones&quot;; some express feeling happy that they were able to make someone they admired happy. Dedicated fans may give up their careers and devote their life savings to supporting and following their favorite members. To foster a closeness between idols and fans, some talent agencies offer meet-and-greets in the form of handshake events, where fans have the opportunity to shake hands, take a photograph, and speak briefly with the idols. AKB48&#x27;s business model created more opportunities for fan interactions with their &quot;idols you can meet&quot; concept. An example of this are their elections, where fans can vote for their favorite member, thereby including the fans directly into the members&#x27; individual success. Because idols share an intimate relationship with their fans, fans may feel &quot;betrayed&quot; if idols reveal unfavorable parts of their personal lives that are different from the image they present, or break the illusion that they are there exclusively for fans.

== Impact ==
=== Economic ===

Idols often appear in advertising, with 50–70% of commercials in Japan featuring an idol. The &quot;CM idol&quot; business model, conceptualized by advertising agency Dentsu in the 1980s, uses idols&#x27; public image as a marketing asset. As the career of idols are dependent on their image, contracting offices create their image based upon trends in the market and with the intent of generating as much revenue as possible. Along with promoting products, commercials are also a cross-platform to promote idols at the same time by keeping both brand and idol product in the forefront of the consumers&#x27; minds. Pitches for commercials are often made with a specific idol who matches the company&#x27;s image in mind. Idols contracted to particular brands are expected to uphold the brand&#x27;s image and may not work for competing brands or networks; the agreement extends to magazine advertisements, online videos, and appearances in dramas. Idols may also provide the music or jingle for commercials. The idol industry makes approximately $1 billion a year.

=== Media ===

Beginning in the 1980s, companies would compete to secure contracts for idols in dramas, which led to the current four-season television cour in Japan. Variety, talk, and music shows also became popular, in part for featuring idols as guests or the stars of the show.

==== Anime and video games ====

The idol industry has crossed over to anime and video games. Using a media mix strategy, various multimedia projects have used fictional idols to market Japanese pop culture and music. The series &quot;Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel&quot; was the first notable anime series to use a media mix marketing strategy, where Takako Ōta would provide the voice to the main character and portray her at music events; the series was used as a vehicle to launch her singing career. The first fictional idol to cross over to mainstream media is Lynn Minmay from &quot;Macross&quot;, whose 1984 single, &quot;Ai Oboete Imasu ka&quot;, charted at #7 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. In the late 2000s, Vocaloid software Hatsune Miku was received positively among amateur music producers, who used her as an avatar to perform their compositions, influencing music.

In the early 2010s, idol-themed multimedia projects, such as &quot;Love Live!&quot;, &quot;The Idolmaster&quot;, and &quot;Uta no Prince-sama&quot;, became popular. Professor Marc Steinberg suggested that the popularity of idol-related media mix projects may stem from the managerial aspect found in life simulation games, with &quot;The Idolmaster&quot; being the first notable idol franchise to include this. These franchises set the fans in the active contributing role of the &quot;producer&quot; and regularly involved interactivity, as input made by the players were crucial to the idols&#x27; success. The growth of idol-related media mix projects in anime and video games was also seen as an attempt from the Japanese government to market Japanese pop culture overseas through the Cool Japan initiative. Music produced by voice actor idols and fictional idols have crossed over to mainstream music charts, with Billboard Japan launching the Billboard Japan Hot Animation Chart on December 1, 2010, exclusively for anime and video game music releases. Fictional idols have been treated like real-life celebrities. Idol-themed anime and video game series have been compared to the sports genre in anime due to a similar competitive nature and team-building the characters face, as well as being linked to the Odagiri effect for featuring attractive people of the same gender interacting with each other.

The idol fan culture is heavily tied to anime and manga, and most fans of anime are also fans of idols. The idea of &quot;&quot;, which was popularized by anime, can be projected onto both idols and fictional characters, linking the two. Some may prefer fictional idols due to them never disbanding, leaving groups, or getting into scandals. A 2005 study by the Nomura Research Institute revealed that idol fans were the third largest group of interests, following comics and anime.

In the late-2010s, the idol agency influenced the business model of VTuber agencies such as Hololive and Nijisanji—which focus on a mix of video game livestreaming, entertainment, and music.

===Criticism===

====Working conditions====

The idol system has been criticized for its strict rules, intense work schedules, and offering idols little control over their personal lives. The system has been likened to salarymen in Japan who are unable to disobey their employers. Labor rights activist Shohei Sakagura stated that idols get very little revenue and are ill-prepared for the work force after leaving their groups, as many of them spend their academic years learning poor job skills. In addition to this, Rob Schwartz from &quot;Billboard&quot; addressed that Japanese mainstream media outlets rarely bring attention to controversies and allegations of power harassment due to self-censorship on what they are allowed to write. Sasetsu Takeda of &quot;GQ Japan&quot; wrote that talent agencies dismiss idols regardless of their popularity, sometimes intentionally blocking job offers in order to pressure them to leave, all while declaring that they are &quot;resting from illness&quot; to the public. Independently managed idol groups offer even less protection, with idols given ambiguously worded contracts that keep them in their companies for years, while offering almost no pay and compensation for transportation and costuming fees. Lawyer Kunitaka Kasai stated management may be poor, especially among independent idol groups, because they were established by people with a lack of experience to fill a demand for idols over the industry&#x27;s growth.

Work schedules for idols have been criticized for being excessive, as idols are expected to work even when sick. Miki Gonobe from &quot;Nikkan Sports&quot; noted that idols generally do not have a labor union and agencies see no need for one, as they view idol activities akin to extracurricular activities at school. She voiced concerns about young girls becoming idols at an early age, especially elementary school students. In addition, Sasetsu Takeda of &quot;GQ Japan&quot; criticized some idol managements for intentionally preventing their talents from taking time off, mentioning it &quot;strange&quot; that idols are only notified of their assignments the night before. He also condemned the idol industry for not providing talents access to better mental health resources, as idols are often suspended or dismissed for publicly showing they are stressed out of concern that they may cause fans to feel worried or upset.

In March 2018, Ehime Girls member Honoka Omoto died by suicide, with her family launching a lawsuit against her talent agency in October 2018. Allegedly, Omoto was working 10 hours a day at the expense of her studies and when she had asked to leave the group, a staff member threatened her with violence while Takahiro Sasaki, the head of her managing company, told her she would have to pay a penalty fee of . In June 2018, a former member of Niji no Conquistador filed a lawsuit against Pixiv representative director, Hiroaki Nagata, and the group&#x27;s management companies for voyeurism and sexual harassment during her time with the group, and Nagata filed a counter lawsuit for libel and resigned several days later. On February 10, 2020, the Tokyo District Court dismissed his claims and ordered him to pay to the woman in damages.

====Dating ban====

Most idols are not allowed to form romantic relationships or must obtain permission from their agencies to get married. Yasushi Akimoto, the producer of AKB48, likened the group&#x27;s dating ban to similar dating bans for baseball teams competing at the , where dating is seen as a distraction from preparing for tournaments. On the other hand, critics have suggested a dating ban is implemented in order to sell a fantasy of idols being accessible to their fans and disagreed with them for being inhumane. &quot;The Japan Times&quot; noted that aside from talent agencies, idol fan culture has contributed to this, especially with male fans of female idols; male fans buy into the idea of &quot;&quot;, which fetishizes weakness and submissiveness while asserting &quot;complete control&quot; over the girls&#x27; sexual independence.

Several idols who were confirmed to have been dismissed, suspended, demoted, or forced to leave their groups following reports of them dating or having sexual relations include Mari Yaguchi, Ai Kago, Aya Hirano, Rino Sashihara, and Minami Minegishi. Minegishi, in particular, caught international media attention after her apology video went viral, causing international criticism over the management of her group, AKB48, as well as the Japanese idol industry. A talent agency filed a lawsuit against a 17-year-old former idol singer for accepting an invitation to a hotel room from two male fans, which had caused her group to disband within the first 3 months of their debut. In September 2015, Judge Akitomo Kojima, along with the Tokyo District Court, ruled in favor of the talent agency and fined the woman to pay , stating that the dating ban was necessary for idols to &quot;win the support of male fans.&quot; In January 2016, a similar lawsuit filed with the Tokyo District Court ruled in favor of a 23-year-old former idol, with Judge Kazuya Hara stating that the dating ban &quot;significantly restricts the freedom to pursue happiness.&quot;

Since handshake and other related events allow fans to be in close proximity with idols, critics also believe that marketing the idols&#x27; accessibility may cause fans to be unable to distinguish between fantasy and real life. Talent agencies have also been criticized over offering inadequate protection towards idols after several incidents of violent attacks on female idols such as the saw attack on Anna Iriyama and Rina Kawaei, the stabbing of Mayu Tomita, and the assault of Maho Yamaguchi.

====Sexualization====

Idols are often sexualized, especially female idols, some of whom also work as gravure idols and have suggestive swimsuit photo shoots that are published in magazines targeted towards adults. With the idol system commodifying youth, the industry is criticized for putting minors at risk, most particularly junior idols, who are aged 15 years and younger. Idol swimsuit photo books are often sold in the same sections as pornographic titles. In 1999, Japan banned production and distribution of sexually explicit depictions of minors, which outlawed photo books depicting nude junior idols. Multiple junior idol distributors closed after possession of child pornography was made illegal in Japan in 2014. However, junior idol content currently stands on legally ambiguous ground due to open interpretations of child pornography laws in Japan.

In 2017, through a survey conducted by the Japanese government, 53 out of 197 women contracted with talent agencies stated that they had been asked to take part in pornographic photo or video shoots of which were not previously disclosed nor included in their contracts. 17 of the women stated that they had performed the request anyway.

<text>Hyphaene thebaica, with common names doum palm (Ar: دوم) and gingerbread tree (also mistakenly doom palm), is a type of palm tree with edible oval fruit. It is a native to the Arabian Peninsula and also to the northern half and western part of Africa where it is widely distributed and tends to grow in places where groundwater is present.

==Description==
The doum palm is a dioecious palm and grows up to high. The trunk, which can have a girth of up to , branches dichotomously and has tufts of large leaves at the ends of the branches. The bark is fairly smooth, dark grey and bears the scars of fallen leaves. The petioles (leaf stalks) are about a metre long, sheathing the branch at the base and armed with stout upward-curving claws. The leaves are fan shaped and measure about . Male and female flowers are produced on separate trees. The inflorescences are similar in general appearance, up to about long, branching irregularly and with two or three spikes arising from each branchlet. Female trees produce large woody fruits, each containing a single seed, that remain on the tree for a long period.

==Distribution and habitat==
The doum palm is native to the northern half of Africa. It is widespread in the Sahel and grows from Mauritania and Senegal in the west, through Central Africa, and east to Egypt, Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania. It tends to grow in areas where groundwater is present and is found along the Nile River in Egypt and Sudan, in riverine areas of northwestern Kenya, and along the Niger River in West Africa. It is also native to the Levant and the Arabian Peninsula (Israel, Sinai, Yemen and Saudi Arabia) and is reportedly naturalized in the Netherlands Antilles in the Caribbean. It grows in wadis and at oases, but sometimes occurs away from water and on rocky hillsides. It dislikes waterlogged soils and is very resistant to destruction by bushfires. 

==Uses==


The doum palm flourishes in hot dry regions where little else grows and the tree is appreciated for the shade it provides. All parts of the tree are useful, but probably the most important product is the leaves. The fibre and leaflets are used by people along the Niger and Nile Rivers to weave baskets, such as in the material culture of the Manasir, mats, coarse textiles, brooms, ropes, string and thatch. The timber is used for posts and poles, furniture manufacture and beehives, and the tree provides wood for fuel. The leaf stalks are used for fencing and the fibre is used for textiles. Other products include fishing rafts, brooms, hammocks, carpets, buttons and beads.

===Food===

The doum palm fruit-dates are edible. In Eritrea its name is &quot;Akat&quot;, or &quot;Akaat&quot; in the Tigre language. The thin dried brown rind is made into molasses, cakes, and sweetmeats. The unripe kernels are edible. The shoots of the germinated seeds are also eaten as a vegetable. 

In Egypt, the fruit is sold by snack street vendors, and in herbalist shops. It is popular among children, gnawing its sweet yet sour hard fibrous flesh beneath the shiny hard crust. Occasionally, its pulp is roasted with sugar and made into a cold summer drink, similar to how Carob drink is made in Egypt. In Diu, Una and Saurashtra region of Gujarat (India), the tree is known as &quot;Hoka Tree&quot; and the red ripe edible fruit is known as &quot;Hoka&quot;. In the northern part of Nigeria, among the Hausa people, it is known as &quot;Goruba&quot;. In south-eastern Niger, its fruit pulp is known as &quot;bri&quot; and a traditional well-known millet pancake is made with this pulp as seasoning, called &quot;massan bri&quot;. 

A commercial drink in Niger, called &quot;Torridité Glacée&quot;, is made from this fruit, somewhat reminiscent in taste of ice coffee or milk chocolate. Apart from the use of the fruit as food, juice is extracted from the young fruit and palm wine is prepared from the sap. 

===Egyptian tombs===
Doum palm was considered sacred by the ancient Egyptians, and the seed was found in many pharaoh&#x27;s tombs. On September 24, 2007, it was announced that a team of Egyptian archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass, discovered eight baskets of 3,000-year-old doum fruit in King Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. The fruit baskets were each 50 centimetres high, the antiquities department said. The fruit are traditionally offered at funerals.

<text>The California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) is a private graduate school (with limited undergraduate offerings) in San Francisco. Founded in 1968 as the California Institute of &quot;Asian&quot; Studies, the name was changed in 1980. CIIS has been regionally accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges since 1981.

While most programs fall into the general categories of psychology and spirituality, degrees offered range from &quot;Anthropology and Social Change&quot; to &quot;Transformative Leadership&quot; to &quot;Psychedelic Studies.&quot; The term &quot;Integral&quot; in the school&#x27;s name refers to Aurobindo&#x27;s Integral Yoga (&quot;purnayoga&quot;), here interpreted as the integration of mind, body, and spirit.

Since 1999, the main location of CIIS has been in the SoMa area, on the border with the Civic Center and Mission districts.

==History==
===American Academy of Asian Studies===
The original name, California Institute of Asian Studies, was inspired by the school&#x27;s origins in the American Academy of Asian Studies (AAAS), founded 1951 by businessman Louis Gainsborough with Alan Watts an early participant. AAAS director Frederic Spiegelberg, a Stanford University professor and Aurobindo devotee, invited Indian philosophy professor and Aurobindo disciple Haridas Chaudhuri to the US, on the recommendation of Aurobindo himself.

Watts taught Buddhist, Taoist, and Hindu philosophy and religion, and established the AAAS as a meeting place for the countercultural movement known as the San Francisco Renaissance. Chaudhuri developed the field of integral counseling psychology, an integration of Indian philosophy with Western psychology. Others offering classes and lectures included C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer, Judith Tyberg, Rom Landau, Saburo Hasegawa, G. P. Malalasekhara, and Gi-ming Shien.

Graduate students included Michael Murphy and Dick Price, future cofounders of the Esalen Institute; Eugene Rose, the future Orthodox hieromonk Seraphim Rose; Gia-Fu Feng, who translated Chinese classics for Watts and would go on to write bestselling translations of the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi; and leading figures of the Beat Generation, including poet Gary Snyder. Price, Feng, and Snyder were among a core group of students that lived at the school. Jack Kerouac visited frequently, and based characters in &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; on Watts and Snyder.

By 1952 the AAAS was in financial decline, after Gainsborough suffered serious business losses. For support and accreditation, the AAAS entered into an agreement to serve as the graduate school of Asian studies for the College of the Pacific. Spiegelberg stepped down, whereupon Watts operated the school on a shoestring budget for the next four years. The conservative college administration, dissatisfied with Watts&#x27; leadership, pushed him out in 1956.

Due to Watts&#x27; departure, a group of resident scholars led by Ananda Claude Dalenberg and including Shien, Feng, and Snyder also left the AAAS to found an intentional community called East-West House. There too, Kerouac&#x27;s visits inspired characters for his books. Residents included Knute Stiles, Joanne Kyger, and other artists, poets and writers of the Beat Generation. Their lack of interest in the Academy added to the financial strain on the school, which closed within the year.

===Cultural Integration Fellowship===
Following the collapse of the AAAS, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship (CIF), an educational and meditation center based in a house on Fulton Street (across from Golden Gate Park, in the Inner Richmond District), and devoted to Aurobindo&#x27;s integral philosophy and the practice of Integral Yoga. Meanwhile, the East-West House community maintained a connection with Watts, his Beat Zen, and later also Shunryū Suzuki and the San Francisco Zen Center.

Esalen Institute would feature seminars by both Chaudhuri and Watts. Esalen cofounders Murphy and Price first met at the CIF in 1960, despite both having previously attended the AAAS, and Spiegelberg&#x27;s lectures at Stanford. Murphy had lived at the Sri Aurobindo ashram in India from June 1956 to October 1957, and was now living, meditating, and studying at the CIF house, where he invited Price to room with him. Within a year they established what would become Esalen Institute in Big Sur.

The Cultural Integration Fellowship developed an education branch that would evolve into a separate institution, while CIF itself would continue as a meditation, learning, and event center at the same location on Fulton Street well into the twenty-first century.

===From CIAS to CIIS===
In 1968, Chaudhuri led the founding and development of a new institution called the California Institute of Asian Studies, which grew out of the education branch of the Cultural Integration Fellowship and built upon the experience of the former American Academy of Asian Studies. Paul Herman continued the work of Chaudhuri and also designed the institute&#x27;s first graduate degree in Integral Psychology, the Integral Counseling Psychology (ICP) degree, which was established in 1973. Spiegelberg served as the institute&#x27;s second president, from 1976 to 1978.

In 1980 the Institute changed its name to the California Institute of &quot;Integral&quot; Studies, and was granted regional accreditation the following year. By the mid-1980s, available programs included clinical psychology, counseling psychology, and East/West psychology. Further programs in organizational development, external studies, and a transformation certificate program were launched in 1985–1986. Around this time, CIIS acquired an extensive library as well as the Integral Counseling Center, a community-based service facility that supported the training needs of clinical and counseling students. Obadiah S. Harris served as school president for a few years before succeeding Manly P. Hall as president of the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles (serving there 1990-2017).

In 2008, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that psychology students at the New College of California were transferring to the California Institute of Integral Studies, due to the closing of the former institution.

In 2012, CIIS, with support from the Aetna Foundation, announced that it was introducing its new onsite Health and Wellness Coaching program to San Francisco&#x27;s Mid-Market District. The program was to be of benefit to children and families living at 10th &amp; Mission Family Housing, a supportive housing project run by Mercy Housing California. In 2013 Jordan published a case report that summarized the experiences from the Integrative Wellness Coaching (IWC) project among homeless and low-income individuals in San Francisco. The IWC model was, at this time, included in the Master of Arts program in Integrative Health Studies at the California Institute of Integral Studies.

In 2015 CIIS acquired the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ACTCM), but in 2021 following an external audit the CIIS Board of Trustees decided to close ACTCM by 2024.

==Philosophical background==
Central to the early history of the institute is a model of so-called &quot;integral education&quot;. Originally set up to study Eastern culture and philosophy in the beginning of the 1950s, the Institute developed further in this direction with the arrival of Haridas Chaudhuri. Chaudhuri introduced the integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo as a navigating principle for education and established a perspective that sought a holistic view of the human being; an integration of material and spiritual values; as well as an integration of Eastern and Western philosophies and worldviews. By the mid-eighties this model of education was firmly established. In 1985 Voigt reported on the graduate programs at CIIS and elaborated on the experience of integral education at the institute. In the late 1990s, CIIS was one of several institutions in the United States associated with the study of Holism and Consciousness.

There is also a connection between the roots of CIIS and the Human Potential Movement. Among the students who attended the colloquia at the American Academy of Asian Studies in the 1950s were Michael Murphy and Dick Price, founders of the Esalen Institute at Big Sur. According to Gleig and Floress, &quot;one can trace a direct line from Integral Yoga through [the Cultural Integration Fellowship] to two of the major centers of the Human Potential movement and the transpersonal psychology field it birthed: Esalen and California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS).&quot;

Gleig and Flores further explain that:
According to Jim Ryan, CIIS, as developed by the founder (Chaudhuri), &quot;had a very wide academic reach, far beyond its basic East-West philosophy concentration. Theses and dissertations were done over many years on the politics, economics, anthropology, sociology, and area studies of many nations of the world.&quot;

==Academics==
CIIS consists of three schools: the School of Professional Psychology &amp; Health, the School of Consciousness and Transformation (mainly humanities subjects), and the School of Undergraduate Studies.

The institute offers interdisciplinary and cross-cultural graduate studies in psychology, counseling, philosophy, religion, cultural anthropology, transformative studies and leadership, integrative health, women&#x27;s spirituality, and community mental health. Many courses combine mainstream academic curricula with a spiritual orientation, including influences from a broad spectrum of mystical or esoteric traditions.

===Accreditation and exam pass rates===
CIIS is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission.

In 2018, The Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS), California&#x27;s state regulatory agency responsible for licensing, examination, and enforcement of Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFTs), released statistics for its January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018 exam cycle.

* CIIS examinees&#x27; pass rate was 82% (Standard exam), compared with a 77% pass rate for all schools in California.
* 83% of CIIS first-time Standard exam-takers passed, compared with an 80% pass rate for California schools overall.

The Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) program in Clinical Psychology is not accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). The program received APA accreditation in 2003, but accreditation was revoked in 2011, and CIIS&#x27;s appeal of the revocation was denied in 2012 on the basis that it was &quot;not fully consistent with the Guidelines and Principles for Accreditation of Programs in Professional Psychology&quot;, notably &quot;several requirements in the following areas: Domain B: Program Philosophy, Objectives, and Curriculum Plan; Domain C: Program Resources; Domain E: Student-Faculty Relations; Domain F: Program Self-Assessment and Quality Enhancement.&quot; CIIS applied for APA accreditation in June 2016, but voluntarily withdrew its application in June 2017.

<text>John Wayne Mixson (June 16, 1922 – July 8, 2020) was an American politician and farmer in Florida who served as the 12th lieutenant governor of Florida from 1979 to 1987, and as the 39th governor of Florida for three days in January 1987. Mixson served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1967 to 1978 prior to being elected as lieutenant governor. He was a lifelong conservative Democrat, and though he served in the Florida legislature and as Florida&#x27;s lieutenant governor as a member of that party, he supported a mix of Democratic and Republican candidates for various state and national offices after retiring from elected office.

Mixson was born and raised in New Brockton, Alabama. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, then attended college at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania before moving to Florida and finishing his degree at the University of Florida in 1947. He became an active member of the American Farm Bureau Federation and served in multiple positions in the organization from the county to statewide level both before and after his terms in elected office.

Mixson entered politics in 1966, with an unsuccessful run in the Democratic primary election for a seat in the Florida Senate. In 1967, he won election to the Florida House of Representatives from Jackson County in the Florida panhandle and served a total of six terms as a state legislator. In 1978, Bob Graham, a state senator from South Florida, tapped Mixson to be his running mate to balance the ticket in his campaign for governor. They won, and Mixson was sworn in as Florida&#x27;s 12th lieutenant governor in January 1979. The ticket of Graham and Mixson were reelected in 1982. but Graham was prohibited from running for a third term in 1986 due to Florida&#x27;s term limit law. Instead, Graham ran for and won election to the United States Senate.

Mixson considered running for governor to replace Graham in 1986, but ultimately decided to retire from electoral politics and Republican Bob Martinez won the office. Graham&#x27;s term in the U.S. Senate began three days before his term as governor ended, so he resigned effective January 3, 1987 to assume his new duties in Washington. As stipulated in state law, lieutenant governor Wayne Mixson briefly assumed the office of governor, and he held the office for about 72 hours before Martinez was inaugurated on January 6, 1987.

==Early life and education==
John Wayne Mixson was born on June 16, 1922, in New Brockton, Alabama, to Cecil Marion Mixson and Mineola Moseley. Mixson&#x27;s great-grandfather and great-uncle had both served as members of the Alabama Legislature. In 1941, he graduated from high school and moved to Florida. In 1942, Mixon joined the United States Navy. Mixson attended Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania before graduating from the University of Florida in 1947, with a degree in business administration. On December 27, 1947, he married Margie Grace in Graceville, Florida.

During the 1950s he served as president of the Jackson County Farm Bureau. Mixson was selected to replace Sandy Johnson as the Florida Farm Bureau&#x27;s field representative in North Florida and took the position on June 15, 1954. In 1955, he was selected to replace Sandy Johnson as organizational director of the Florida Farm Bureau. From 1958 to 1960, he served as the southern regional director for the national Farm Bureau.

In 1961, Mixson resigned from his position within the Florida Farm Bureau to manage his farm and considered running in the 9th congressional district during the 1962 elections. In 1963, he was selected to serve on the board of directors of the Jackson County Farm Bureau and was reelected in 1964, and 1966.

In 1965, E. H. Finlayson, president of the Florida Farm Bureau, announced that he would not seek reelection, and Mixson ran to succeed him, but later withdrew. Art Karst was selected to replace Finlayson while Mixson was selected to serve as vice president.

In 1977, he had a net worth of $256,200, assets worth $1,051,400, with $564,900 coming from his 1,883 acres of farm land and $150,000 from his cattle, and an income of $298,592, with a majority coming from cattle, peanuts, and grain sales.

Mixson ran for the Democratic nomination for the state Senate from the 6th district in 1966, but placed third behind Bill Pearce and L. P. Gibson. In 1967, he ran for the Democratic nomination for the state House of Representatives from the 11th district. In the primary he defeated incumbent Representative Coy J. Mitchell and later faced no opposition in the general election. In 1968 and 1970, he won reelection.

On June 29, 1972, he announced that he would seek reelection to the House of Representatives. In the Democratic primary he defeated John Grace, a 26 year old veteran of the Vietnam War, and in the general election Mixson faced no opposition. In 1974, he was reelected.

====Tenure====

During the 1967–1968 session of the House of Representatives Mixson served on the Ad Valorem Taxation, Appropriations, Claims, Public Health and Welfare, and State Institutions committees. During the 1968–1970 session of the House of Representatives he served as the vice chairman of the Agriculture committee and as a member of the Ad Valorem Taxation, and Transportation committees. During the 1970–1972 session of the House of Representatives he served as the vice chairman of Community Affairs committee and as a member of the Agriculture, Appropriations, and Migrant Affairs committees.

In 1971, Mixson was selected to serve as a Majority Whip alongside John Clark, Elvin L. Martinez, Roy Hess, Ed Fortune, John Forbes, Lew Whitworth, and Harold Featherstone. Each whip was placed in charge of ten of the eighty-one Democratic members of the House.

During the 1972 Democratic presidential primaries he supported Senator Henry M. Jackson.

In January 1972, Mixson was selected by Speaker Richard Pettigrew to replace Howell Lancaster as chairman of the Agriculture committee due to Lancaster&#x27;s death. During the 1973–1975 session of the House of Representatives he served as the chairman of Agriculture committee and as a member of the Rules, and Community Affairs committees.

In 1973, an impeachment inquiry was held for Lieutenant Governor Thomas Burton Adams Jr. for using public employees for personal financial gain during his service as Secretary of Commerce. On May 17, the House of Representatives voted 61 to 55 in favor of impeaching Adams, but needed a two-thirds majority of 78 to impeach him. Mixson had voted against impeaching. After failing to impeach Adams the House of Representatives voted 88 to 26 in favor of censuring Adams for using the office for personal gain, which Mixson voting in support of the censure motion.

On June 2, 1975, the House of Representatives voted 104 to 15, with Mixson voting against, in favor of impeaching state Treasurer Tom O&#x27;Malley.

===Lieutenant governor===
====Elections====
=====1978=====
During the 1978 Florida gubernatorial election Mixson was speculated as a possible lieutenant gubernatorial nominee for both Bob Graham and Robert L. Shevin. In January 1978, Shevin listed Mixson as one of his five candidates for the position alongside state Senators Lori Wilson, Betty Castor, James Glisson, and state Speaker of the House T. Terrell Sessums.

On March 18, Mixson announced that he would be Graham&#x27;s running mate, but Graham stated on March 19, that a final decision had not been made yet. On March 30, Graham announced that Mixson would serve as his lieutenant governor as Mixson could appeal to rural voters in northern Florida. Following his selection he was endorsed by the Jackson County Floridian, the daily newspaper in Marianna, Florida, where Mixson lived, and by Guy Long, president of the NAACP in Jackson County, who held a press conference to refute rumors of Mixson being a redneck racist.

Mixson was accused of stating &quot;You all might think you have the nigger vote sewed up in Jackson County, but the truth is, whoever pays &#x27;em last gets it&quot; at Miami&#x27;s Tiger Bay Club on August 16, by the Miami Herald. Graham and Mixson stated that Mixson did not make that statement.

In the Democratic gubernatorial primary runoff Graham and Mixson defeated Shevin and Glisson with 482,535 votes to 418,636 votes. In the general election Graham and Mixson defeated Jack Eckerd and Paula Hawkins, the Republican gubernatorial and lieutenant gubernatorial nominees. Sam Mitchell was elected to succeed Mixson in the Florida House of Representatives from the 7th district.

=====1982=====

In April 1981, Mixson stated that he would seek reelection with Graham in 1982, however, on June 23, he stated that he might not run due to him feeling that he had been cut out of administration decisions as Graham became more reliant on his advisers Garry Smith and Steve Hull. However, after Mixson made the statement Graham held a ninety-minute meeting to discuss Mixson&#x27;s complaints, and on June 24, Mixson stated that &quot;I think Bob Graham&#x27;s the greatest governor Florida has ever had, I&#x27;m very rewarded to be a part of his team&quot; and that he would still seek reelection.

Mixson was the first lieutenant governor of Florida to win reelection to a second term.

====Tenure====

On January 2, 1979, Mixson was inaugurated as the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Florida by Chief Justice Arthur J. England Jr. of the Supreme Court of Florida.

On January 22, Mixson led a 37-member delegation, as Governor Graham was unable, to Guatemala City, Guatemala, for the state&#x27;s fourth trade mission called the &quot;Intercambio Comercial&quot;, with the past three being to Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, meant to increase trade between Florida and Central and South America. The trade mission was the first overseas trip sponsored by Graham&#x27;s gubernatorial administration.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed Mixson as special ambassador to Ecuador. During the 1980 presidential election Mixson supported President Carter. At the state Democratic convention Mixson was selected to serve as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in support of Carter alongside Graham, James C. Smith, Doyle Conner, Claude Pepper, Hazel Talley Evans, and Phyllis Miller.

From February 10 to 16, 1980, Mixson was meant to lead a 35-member delegation, which included Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner, state House Speaker J. Hyatt Brown, and Commerce Secretary Sidney Levin, during Florida&#x27;s fifth Intercambio Comercial to Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador. However, he was unable to lead the delegation as he had been selected to replace Ronnie Book as the head of Graham&#x27;s legislative lobbying staff and had to lobby for Graham&#x27;s 1980 tax reform legislation.

In April 1980, Mixson was criticized for his intervening to prevent the suspension of Marianna Circuit Court Clerk Raymond Bruner. The Florida Ethics Commission voted four to one, with Mixson being the only vote against, in favor of recommending the suspension of Bruner for allegations that he had used his position as clerk to sexually harass fourteen employees. Mixson later sent a letter to Graham written by Bruner&#x27;s lawyers alleging that Bruner was the victim of a political conspiracy. On June 27, Graham signed an executive order to suspend Bruner with the order stating that &quot;these women were subjected to improper sexual advances in actual physical form, including actual physical touching, grabbing, kissing or attempted kissing, pinching, patting, and rubbing, all against their will&quot; and accused Bruner of attempting to cover up the allegations.

On April 29, 1980, Alabama Governor Fob James proclaimed &quot;Wayne Mixson Day&quot; in honor of Mixson giving an address to the Alabama state legislature on the same day.

In 1985, Mixson served as Florida&#x27;s representative at President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s second inaugural address.

===Governor===

After serving as Florida&#x27;s governor for the maximum two consecutive terms, Bob Graham was elected to the United States Senate in November 1986. He soon announced that he planned to resign as Florida&#x27;s governor to assume his new role on January 3, several days before the end of his term. Mixson would therefore become Florida&#x27;s governor in the interim. Prior to taking the office Mixson received letters asking either for themselves to be appointed as his lieutenant governor-designate or to appoint a black, Hispanic, or a woman as a symbolic gesture.

<text>Piyassili (also transliterated as &quot;Piyaššili&quot;; died ca. 1315 BC), also known as Sarri-Kusuh (or &quot;Šarri-Kušuḫ&quot;), was a Hittite prince and a middle son of King Šuppiluliuma I—younger than the heir Arnuwanda II, but older than the eventual successor Muršili II and probably older than the ill-fated Zannanza too. After Šuppiluliuma concluded a treaty with Shattiwaza, son of King Tushratta of Mitanni, and married one of his daughters to him, Piyassili led a Hittite army that put Shattiwaza on the throne of Hanigalbat. According to Hittite sources, Piyassili and Shattiwaza crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish, then marched against Irridu, already in Hurrian territory. After having reduced Irridu and Harran, they continued east towards to Washukanni and perhaps conquered the capital Taite as well.

==Biography==
After Shattiwaza had been made a vassal ruler of Hanigalbat, Suppiluliuma gave to Piyassili the Hurrian name Sarri-Kusuh and the territory of Ashtata (with the cities of Ekalte, Ahuna and Terqa) and Carchemish, formerly belonging to Hanigalbat. &quot;And all of the cities of the land of Carchemish, Murmurik, Shipri, Mazuwati and Šurun – these fortified cities– I gave to my son.&quot; In fact, the whole former territory of Hanigalbat west of the Euphrates seems to have come under direct Hittite rule and was governed by Piyassili.

When the Egyptians attacked Kadesh, Šuppiluliuma besieged and retook the town. The people were deported and Šuppiluliuma made Piyassili governor of that town as well. Still bearing the name &quot;Sarri-Kusuh&quot; Piyashshili came to Muršili&#x27;s aid in the campaign against Arzawa around 1320 BC. Piyassili then returned to Carchemish.

Piyassili fell ill and died before the ninth year of Muršili II&#x27;s reign. After his death, a rebellion broke out in Kadesh and Nuhašše. After it had been quelled, Piyassili&#x27;s son was made king of Carchemish by his uncle Muršili II.

<text>Bagirmi (also Baguirmi; autonym: &quot;tàrà ɓármà)&quot; is the language of the Bagirmi people of Chad belonging to the Central Sudanic family, which has been tenatively classified as part of the Nilo-Saharan superfamily. It was spoken by 44,761 people in 1993, mainly in the Chari-Baguirmi Region, as well as in Mokofi sub-prefecture of Guéra Region. It was the language of the Sultanate of Bagirmi (1522-1871) and then the Wadai Empire before the Scramble for Africa.

During the 1990s, Bagirmi was given written form and texts providing basic literacy instruction were composed through the efforts of Don and Orpha Raun, Christian missionaries of the Church of the Lutheran Brethren of America, late in their Chadian careers. In 2003, Anthony Kimball developed a font to support the Bagirmi alphabet and a Keyman input method for Latin keyboards, and the body of published Baguirmi literature continues to expand. The majority of this literature was distributed in Chad by David Raun, a missionary and the son of Don and Orpha Raun, at a token cost as a service to the Bagirmi-speaking peoples of Chad.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
The consonant table presented below contains sounds which are supposed to be native to Bagirmi. The sounds f, v, z, ʃ and h are heard in loan-words.
The sounds given in brackets are variants (not specific phonemes).

=== Vowels ===
* i-vowel (i, I) is similar to the vowel in English &quot;feet&quot;, I - in &quot;fit&quot;. Their using depends on position and context. Being pronounced in isolation i-vowel appears in monosyllables and polysyllables. Also it could be found before ny. 
:: si - milk
:: ji - hand
:: ri -name
* u-vowel (u, U) is similar to the vowel in English &quot;pool&quot; (U - in &quot;pull&quot;). Accordingly to position, the distribution of u-vowels is parallel.7
:: lua - year
:: mʷu - grass
:: tut(u) - dry
* e-vowel (e, ɛ) is close to the English vowel in &quot;bed&quot;. Sometimes e-vowel cannot be distinguished from ɛ clearly. Words with e-vowels are more common than with ɛ.
:: deb(e) - person
:: tej(e) - honey
:: gèl(e) - lefthand
* o-vowel (o, ɔ): o is more open than Cardinal №7, while ɔ is near to Cardinal №6. In some cases it cannot be distinguished o from ɔ. Words with o-vowels are more common than with ɔ-vowels.
:: ro - body
:: tòt(o) - hill
:: kʷɔrlo - giraffe
:: kʷɔlɛ - pot
* the central vowels ä, ö: ä often emerges as a modificator of a or another vowel when it&#x27;s about connected speech. Ö has been noticed in a higher number of words. 
:: mà kàb(e) - I shall go
:: köndèi - small basket

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===
Most of the nouns in Bagirmi are disyllabic and the common noun form is a consonant + vowel + consonant + vowel. The final vowel is usually semi-mute.

: Examples:
:: - child
:: - shadow

The simpliest form of nouns in Bagirmi is monosyllabic and usually consists of a consonant and vowel.

: Examples:
:: - body
:: - foreigner
:: - night

In Bagirmi language plurality of nouns is presented by the suffix . This rule applies not only to the simple noun but also to its possible qualifiers and to the end in noun compounds and genetive constructions. In this case, the suffix is added only once at the end of the noun phrase.

: Examples:
:: (eye) formula_1 (eyes)
:: (sheep) formula_1 (sheeps)

==== Forms denoting sex ====
To indicate sex (man, male) or (woman, female) should be added to a noun.

: Examples:
:: - boy
:: - girl

=== Adjectives ===
Most words in adjectival constructions act as nominal or verbal roots and cannot be differentiated from them (except the fact that they are more subject to reduplication). These words are “adjectives” only due to their applications. Also, a lot of these words can take both nominal and verbal affixes.

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns in Bagirmi are used as:

====A. forms of personal mention applied in isolation or as subject in non-verbal predication====
: Examples:
:: – I am a man
:: – you are a Bagirmi
:: – he/she is big
:: – I myself
:: – we ourselves

====B. forms of personal mention applied as object of a verb as possessor in the genitive case and also after prepositions====
The first and third persons: sing. and are used after a consonant, and after a vowel.

: Examples:
:: As object of verb:
::: (following a consonant) – they see me
::: (following a vowel) – they leave me
:: After a preposition:
::: – with me
::: – with you
::: – with him/her

====C. forms of personal mention applied before suffixes and postpositions====
In this position pronouns don&#x27;t have any changes except the omission of semi-mute vowels. It&#x27;s only about the first and third persons of B-forms.

The examples demonstrate only the general locative postposition .

:: – on me
:: – on him
:: – on us

=== Verbs ===

==== Verb classes ====
For conjugational purposes verbs are divided into five classes built on the form of the verbal roots. Verbal roots mainly have a monosyllabic or dissyllabic form. A reliable indicator of class is the presence or absence of the prefix in the Indefenite Aspect or the Infinitive.

# Class I: Monosyllabic verbs containing a consonant (or consonant combination) and vowel.
#: - eat
#: - put
#: - sit
# Class II: Dissyllabic verbs containing a vowel plus consonant plus vowel (the last vowel is often semi-mute). Also, all verbs of Class II take prefix.
#: - go
#: - see
#: - give
# Class III: Dissyllabic verbs containing a consonant plus vowel plus consonant plus vowel (the last vowel is often semi-mute). A consonant can be presented as a consonant combination. Monosyllabic verbs could also be included into this Class. They consist of a consonant plus long (or half-length) vowel or vowel combination.
#: - make, do
#: - swim
#: - cook
# Class IV: Verbs of the Class III pattern but with an initial vowel. 
# Class V: Verbs containing a consonant plus vowel plus consonant plus vowel plus consonant plus vowel (sometimes the mid/final vowel is missing). 
#: - roll
#: - clean
#: - scatter

==== Verb aspects ====
There are two types of verb aspects in Bagirmi language: the Definite Aspect and the Indefinite Aspect. The Definite Aspect is applicable to complete, momentary verb actions. The Indefinite Aspect, conversely, represents verb actions which are incomplete, progressive. The Definite Aspect is also used to indicate the Imperative mood. The Indefinite Aspect is defined by the prefix in verbs from Class I and Class II.

==== Negation ====
The negation of verbs is presented by adding a postposition . The initial vowel is omitted when preceded by another vowel (except the situation when pronouns and are placed).

: Examples: 
:: – I did not eat 
:: – we did not go
:: – you (pl) do not, or did not, want

There is also a postposition which means “no more”, “no longer”.

: Examples:
:: – I did not do it again
:: – they did not go there any longer

=== Word order ===
Bagirmi language saves a direct word order in a sentence (subject + verb + object).

When it comes to the genitive construction, the possessor always follows the possessed.

: Examples:
:: – captive of the Patia

=== Adverbs ===
In Bagirmi there are only several words whose function is adverbial and could be described as adverbs. Majority of adverbial constructions are made up of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectivals, with or without implementing of prepositions and postpositions, could contain a phrase or even a sentence. Not rarely an adverbial phrase is built up by integrating a preposition or postposition with a noun or pronoun.

The usual place of adverbials is at the end of a sentence. This position is especially suitable for interrogatives and adverbials of place and manner.

=== Numerals ===
In Bagirmi there are no ordinal numbers. The order is expressed only by the cardinals, adverbs and postpositions. And adverbials (&quot;times&quot;) can be expressed by using mʷot(o) (under).

: Example:
:: - He came on the third day
:: - He came fifth
:: - He did this ten times

==== Word order ====
In Bagirmi language the order of numerals and nouns in relation to each other is reverse.

: Examples:
::  - two days
:: - five months

Caputo has written 18 books, including three memoirs, five books of general nonfiction, nine novels, and one book of short stories. His latest is the novel &quot;Memory and Desire&quot; which was published in 2023 by Arcade Publishing.

==Early life and career==
Philip Caputo was born in Westchester, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and raised in Berwyn and Westchester. He attended Fenwick High School and Loyola University Chicago, graduating with a B.A. in English in 1964. From 1965–1966 Caputo served in the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) as an infantry lieutenant (platoon commander) in the United States Marine Corps. Caputo served in combat and earned several medals and awards upon completion of his tour of duty.

After serving three years in the Corps, Caputo began a career in journalism, joining the staff of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1968. In 1973, Caputo was part of a writing team that won the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on election fraud in Chicago.

The book was adapted as a 1980 two-part TV movie of the same name, starring Brad Davis, Keith Carradine, Brian Dennehy, and Michael O&#x27;Keefe. A Fortieth Anniversary Edition of &quot;A Rumor of War&quot; was published in summer 2017.

&quot;Memory and Desire&quot; (2023), Caputo’s 18th book, is a novel set in south Florida about love and the persistence of love, about desire and desire remembered, and the reunion of a fifty-year-old man with a son he fathered out of wedlock in his youth.

<text>Jan Fredrik &quot;Freddy&quot; Modin (born 8 October 1974) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey left winger who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He is best remembered for his most productive years with the Tampa Bay Lightning, with whom he won the Stanley Cup in 2004.

== Playing career ==
Modin played his youth league games for the Njurunda Sports Club, like Henrik Zetterberg. In 2008, the club renamed their arena—until then known as Njurunda Ishall—to Modin &amp; Zetterberg-hallen.

Modin was drafted 64th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning on October 1, 1999, where he served as an alternate captain for several seasons. In 2001, he was the lone Lightning player at the 51st NHL All-Star Game and won the &quot;Hardest Shot&quot; competition with a blast clocked at 102.1 mph. He went on to win the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in the 2003–04 season. For the 2004–05 season, Fredrik Modin returned to Sweden to play for Timrå IK due to the NHL lockout. He scored 12 goals, 24 assists and had a total of 36 points. On June 30, 2006, he was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets (along with Fredrik Norrena) in exchange for Marc Denis.

Modin served as an alternate captain for the Blue Jackets. He has begun to decline in production, due to injuries. He scored a goal in Game 4 of the Blue Jackets&#x27; opening round playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings, the Blue Jackets&#x27; first-ever playoff appearance.

During the 2009–10 season, at the NHL trade deadline, Modin was traded by the Blue Jackets to the Los Angeles Kings for future considerations on March 3, 2010.

On September 6, 2010, Modin signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Atlanta Thrashers. He posted 7 goals in 36 games for the Thrashers. On February 28, 2011, Modin was traded to the Calgary Flames for a seventh round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.

Hampered by a lingering back injury in his last two seasons, Modin announced his retirement on May 19, 2011.

<doc id="950919" wikidata="Q4997222" url="?curid=950919" title="Bum Phillips">
<text>Oail Andrew &quot;Bum&quot; Phillips Jr. (September 29, 1923 – October 18, 2013) was an American football coach at the high school, college and professional levels. He served as head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for the Houston Oilers from 1975 to 1980 and the New Orleans Saints from 1981 to 1985.

==Early football career==
Phillips played football at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, but enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps on September 30, 1942. He became one of the elite Marine Raiders.

After he returned from the war, Phillips completed the remaining year on his degree at Lamar (a junior college at the time), and enrolled at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, lettering in football in 1948 and 1949 and graduating with a degree in education in 1949.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Phillips coached high school football in various Texas cities including Nederland, Jacksonville, Amarillo, and Port Neches-Groves.

His college coaching stints included serving as an assistant coach at Texas A&amp;M University (for Bear Bryant), the University of Houston (for Bill Yeoman), Southern Methodist University (for Hayden Fry), and Oklahoma State University with Jim Stanley. He was the head coach at Texas Western University (now the University of Texas at El Paso) for one season in 1962.

==NFL coaching career==
In the late 1960s, Phillips was hired by Sid Gillman to serve as a defensive assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. In 1973, Gillman became head coach of the Houston Oilers, and he brought Phillips with him as his defensive coordinator.

Phillips was promoted to head coach of the Oilers on January 25, 1975, and he served in that capacity through 1980. As coach of the Oilers, he presided over the team&#x27;s most successful era since its days in the American Football League. Under Phillips, the Oilers reached the AFC Championship Game in two consecutive seasons, losing to the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers 34–5 in 1978 and 27–13 in 1979. Both teams were members of the competitive AFC Central Division and thus played three times in both 1978 and 1979, fueling an intense rivalry. During this period of league-wide AFC dominance, some commentators considered the Oilers and Steelers to be the two best teams in the NFL. Phillips remarked at the time, &quot;The road to the Super Bowl goes through Pittsburgh.&quot;

Phillips was fired on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1980 by Oilers owner Bud Adams. Phillips was fired because he failed to report a player&#x27;s in season recreational drug use to Adams until after the season ended. His 59 wins would be the most in franchise history until Jeff Fisher passed him in 2001 (by then, the team had become the Tennessee Titans). Soon afterward, he was hired by New Orleans Saints owner John Mecom Jr. as head coach and general manager of the Saints, serving from 1981 through the first 12 games of the 1985 season. As in his coaching tenure with the Oilers, Phillips took off his trademark Stetson inside the Louisiana Superdome. In 1983, his Saints went into the final week needing one more win to secure the first winning season and playoff berth in franchise history. The Rams beat the Saints for the final playoff spot in week 16, 26–24 on Mike Lansford&#x27;s 42-yard field goal with 00:02 to play.

Phillips offered to resign prior to the 1985 season after Tom Benson purchased the Saints for $70 million from Mecom, but Benson asked him to stay on to help his transition into NFL ownership. 

Phillips resigned as Saints coach on November 25, 1985, one day after a 30–23 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, 12 games into the season. His son, Wade Phillips, would take over the coaching reins on an interim basis for the remaining four games of the 1985 season. The Saints defeated the Rams 29–3 in Wade&#x27;s first game at the helm, but finished with losses to the Cardinals, 49ers and Falcons. He finished his NFL head coaching career with 82 wins, the same number of wins as his son.

==Later life and family==
Phillips later worked as a football color analyst for television and Oilers radio broadcasts. He subsequently retired to his horse ranch in Goliad, Texas.

His son, Wade Phillips, has also held assistant and head coaching jobs in the NFL and was the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys from February 2007 to November 2010. Wade was hired by the Houston Texans on January 5, 2011, as their new defensive coordinator almost exactly 30 years after his father was terminated by Oilers owner Bud Adams on December 28, 1980, after the Oilers failed to advance past the first round of the playoffs. Wade won a Super Bowl title at Super Bowl 50 with the Denver Broncos as defensive coordinator, and was the defensive coordinator of the Los Angeles Rams who advanced to Super Bowl LIII and later parted ways with the Rams following the 2019 season.

His grandson Wes is also an NFL assistant coach.

In 2010, he published his memoirs, &quot;Bum Phillips: Coach, Cowboy, Christian.&quot;

==Death==
Phillips died at his ranch in Goliad, Texas, on October 18, 2013, at the age of 90. He was survived by his second wife, Debbie, and six children from his first marriage along with almost two dozen grandchildren.

In honor of Bum Phillips coaching both Nederland and Port Neches-Groves High Schools, the rivalry game between his two favorite schools is named the Bum Phillips Bowl.

==Quotes==
Phillips was known for his trademark Stetson cowboy hat on the sidelines, except when the Oilers played in the Astrodome or other domed stadiums. He stated that his mother taught him not to wear a hat indoors; his former boss Bear Bryant similarly refused to wear his trademark houndstooth hat during indoor games. Phillips wore his cowboy hat with blue jeans and a button down shirt, in contrast to Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry who wore a suit and tie with his trademark fedora.

Besides his trademark cowboy hat, Phillips is also known for his colorful quotes, such that &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; noted that Wikipedia had a whole section of his page dedicated to these quips. In the week leading up to Super Bowl LIII, his son Wade was quoted as saying “Unfortunately, I get older but Tom Brady doesn’t,” while sporting the elder Phillip&#x27;s sheepskin coat and cowboy hat as the Los Angeles Rams arrived in Atlanta.

*&quot;There&#x27;s two kinds of coaches, them that&#x27;s fired and them that&#x27;s gonna be fired.&quot;
*&quot;I always thought I could coach. I just thought people were poor judges of good coaches.&quot;
*&quot;In the country, they don&#x27;t say &#x27;bumblebees&#x27; they say &#x27;bummel bees,&quot; on how Bum Phillips really got his name. His Aunt JoAnnette could only say &#x27;Bum&#x27;. 
*&quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a hammer and tong game like that one.&quot;
*To a reporter who said, &quot;He sure gets up slow&quot;, after Earl Campbell had been tackled. &quot;Yes, but he goes down slow, too.&quot;
*&quot;The harder we played the behinder we got.&quot;
*&quot;Mama always said that if it can&#x27;t rain on you, you&#x27;re indoors.&quot; (Explaining why he wouldn&#x27;t wear his cowboy hat in the Astrodome, the first domed stadium)
*&quot;Dallas Cowboys may be America&#x27;s team, but the Houston Oilers are Texas&#x27; team.&quot;
*&quot;I never scrimmage Oilers against Oilers... what for? Houston isn&#x27;t on our schedule.&quot; (Source: &quot;The Book of Sports Lists&quot;)
*(To an official) &quot;Hey, can I, can I tell you one thing? That&#x27;s three holding penalties on one football team in a quarter and a half. (Pauses) That ain&#x27;t funny.&quot;
*(To an official) &quot;Now, you can&#x27;t do that! If you do it, I&#x27;m telling you you&#x27;ll have more hell over it than a little bit.&quot;
*(after playing the Steelers for the fifth time in two seasons and planning to meet them a sixth time) &quot;The road to the Super Bowl runs through Pittsburgh, sooner or later you&#x27;ve got to go to Pittsburgh.
*(20 years after playing Pittsburgh six times in two seasons) &quot;Don&#x27;t take long to spend all the time you want in Pittsburgh.&quot;
*(referring to Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula) &quot;He can take his&#x27;n and beat your&#x27;n and take your&#x27;n and beat his&#x27;n.&quot; He also said the same line about Bear Bryant.
*(referring to Houston Oilers quarterback Warren Moon) &quot;That boy could throw a football through a car wash and not get it wet.&quot;
*(when asked about Oilers RB Earl Campbell&#x27;s inability to finish a one-mile run in training camp) &quot;When it&#x27;s first and a mile, I won&#x27;t give it to him.&quot;
*(when asked by Bob Costas why he took his wife on all of the Oilers&#x27; road trips) &quot;Because she&#x27;s too ugly to kiss goodbye.&quot;
*(on January 7, 1980, to the crowd at the Astrodome that welcomed the Oilers home after their second consecutive loss to the Steelers in the AFC championship game) &quot;One year ago, we knocked on the door. This year, we beat on the door. Next year, we&#x27;re going to kick the son of a bitch in.&quot;
*(of Earl Campbell) &quot;I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s in a class by himself, but I do know that when that class gets together, it sure don&#x27;t take long to call the roll.&quot;
*Late one night, Phillips and Sid Gillman were watching film and Phillips began to doze off. Gillman woke him up by saying, &quot;Hey Bum, this is better than making love.&quot; Phillips responded, &quot;Either I don&#x27;t know how to watch film, Sid, or you don&#x27;t know how to make love.&quot; (Phillips later indicated that his language may have actually been stronger than that.)
* (From a PRO! Gameday program interview, when asked what he would be doing if he wasn&#x27;t an NFL coach) &quot;Teach first grade. Little bitty kids. You say &#x27;boo&#x27; to &#x27;em and they jump. And you don&#x27;t have to fine &#x27;em.&quot;
*&quot;Respect all. Fear none.&quot;
*&quot;The only discipline that lasts is self-discipline.&quot;
*&quot;Two kinds of players ain&#x27;t worth a damn: One that never does what he&#x27;s told, and one who does nothin&#x27; but what he&#x27;s told.&quot;

<doc id="950920" wikidata="Q1413849" url="?curid=950920" title="Statute of Labourers 1351">
<text>The Statute of Labourers was a law created by the English Parliament under King Edward III in 1351 in response to a labour shortage, which aimed at regulating the labour force by prohibiting requesting or offering a wage higher than pre-Plague standards and limiting movement in search of better conditions. The popular narrative about its success and enforcement holds that it was poorly enforced and did not stop the rise in real wages. However, immediately after the Black Death, real wages did not rise, despite the labour shortage.

==Background==
The Black Death, a pandemic of bubonic plague, killed more than one-third of the population of Europe and 30–40% of the population in Britain and caused a dramatic decrease in the supply of labour. Landowners suddenly faced a sharp increase in competition for workers to work for them. Labourers had increased bargaining power and commanded higher wages. The increase in labour cost also led to inflation throughout the economy. The elite class lamented the sudden shift in economic power. In an attempt to control labour costs and price levels, Edward III issued the Ordinance of Labourers 1349. Parliament attempted to reinforce the Ordinance with the Statute of Labourers. It was one of the causes, among others, of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381.

==Content==

The statute set a maximum wage for labourers that was commensurate with wages paid before the Black Death, specifically, in the year 1346. It also mandated that able-bodied men and women should work and imposed harsh penalties for those who remained idle.

It required:

==Consequences==
The statute&#x27;s changes failed to take into account the changing economic conditions during the Black Death, and furthermore the period from which wage levels were taken was one of economic depression in England as a result of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Therefore, wages during the Black Death were set even lower to match those during this depression. In practice, the statute was poorly enforced and unsuccessful, but it set a precedent that distinguished between labourers who were &quot;able in body&quot; to work and those who could not work for whatever reasons. This distinction resurfaced in later laws regarding poverty.

The Statute of Labourers (and its counterpart, the Ordinance of Labourers) was, of course, very unpopular with the peasants, who wanted higher wages and better living standards, and was a contributing factor to subsequent peasant revolts, most notably the English peasants&#x27; revolt of 1381. Similar processes happened throughout Europe – wage caps following a labour shortage after the Black Death resulting in popular revolts.

The statute was poorly enforced in most areas (and even then, typically only against laborers and not employers), and farm wages in England on average doubled between 1350 and 1450.

==Repeal==
It was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863.

<doc id="950923" wikidata="Q7882690" url="?curid=950923" title="Uncle Albert">
<text>Albert [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] Trotter, better known as Uncle Albert (19 November – 2001), is a fictional character in the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, portrayed by Buster Merryfield. He was introduced during the fourth series as a replacement for the character of Grandad (the character&#x27;s brother) due to the sudden death of Lennard Pearce in 1984.

==Fictional character biography==
Albert was born sometime in the 1910s on Tobacco Road in Wapping, London, close to the Docks, where he lived with his brothers Edward, George, and Jack. His year of birth is not known; in The Bible of Peckham, it is stated he was born in 1920 but this was not written by John Sullivan. He was most likely born around the time of the outbreak of the First World War.

Albert joined the Royal Navy in 1937, aged 17, and two years later was called to action following the outbreak of the Second World War. He spent the rest of his life recounting tales from the war. He was awarded seven medals, although this was largely because he had an extraordinarily unfortunate time. He served on seven ships that were either torpedoed or divebombed over a period of four years, including two during peacetime. Albert undertook basic parachute training on the Isle of Wight, which enabled him to fall without injuring himself. He used this to his advantage in the post-war years, staging mock falls down the cellars of pubs in order to receive financial compensation. He staged falls down at least fifteen cellars, gaining the nickname of &quot;The Ferret&quot; in the process. After the war, Albert joined the Merchant Navy. In spite of his seafaring past, Albert cannot swim. He lost contact with his brother Edward because of a fight over Albert&#x27;s future wife Ada to whom they were both attracted. Despite this, he attended Edward&#x27;s funeral.

Uncle Albert, as he was known by his two great nephews, Del Boy and Rodney, joined the cast in 1985 during the episode &quot;Strained Relations&quot; when he attended the funeral of his older brother Ted. Shortly after the funeral, Albert was abandoned by his nephew Stan and his wife Jean, with whom he was living in their mobile home. After initial reluctance, Del agreed to let him stay. Albert was described by Del as &quot;England&#x27;s greatest sailor since Nelson lost the Armada.&quot;

It is revealed by Albert in &quot;Tea for Three&quot;, that Grandad and Albert fell out over Albert&#x27;s later wife, Ada, whom they both fancied at the time. The fight ended in them both hitting each other and after that, they never spoke again. Ultimately, Albert&#x27;s marriage to Ada was not an entirely happy one, and the two were estranged by the late 1960s, though never formally divorced. They had no children.

Albert was famed for telling stories that often began with the words &quot;During the war...&quot;, which often annoyed Del and Rodney but almost always caught their interest once he started telling them the story. In Albert&#x27;s final appearance in the series (&quot;Time On Our Hands&quot;, the third and final chapter of the 1996 Christmas trilogy), a frustrated Del cuts Albert off at &quot;During th...&quot; by threatening to pour a cup of tea over his head should he complete the sentence &quot;During the war...&quot;. Albert restarts his anecdote with, &quot;During the 1939-1945 conflict with Germany...&quot;

Albert was less of a help than a hindrance; in &quot;Time on Our Hands&quot;, Albert ruins a long anticipated dinner with Raquel&#x27;s parents (whom she had not spoken to for many years). After hours of preparation and worrying about the meal, and the oversized table, everything appears to be going well until Del realises that Albert has confused the jars containing coffee and gravy granules. By this time, however, it is too late; the guests have already poured coffee over their meals. Before eating, Del punishes Albert by pouring the &quot;gravy&quot; all over his meal. The meal is abandoned early, and Raquel goes to fetch the &quot;coffee&quot;. In Del Boy&#x27;s own words: &quot;Not only have you managed to sink every battleship and aircraft carrier that you&#x27;ve ever sailed on, but now you&#x27;ve gone and knackered a gravy boat!&quot;

Albert had a female companion called Elsie Partridge, who was first mentioned by Rodney in &quot;The Unlucky Winner Is...&quot;, and appeared in the episode &quot;Sickness and Wealth&quot;. His nephews often teased him about this as well as his ability to sink ships and, with his bald head and big white beard, his resemblance to Captain Birdseye.

Although Del and Rodney often teased Albert, they showed their care for him when they found out he had died in &quot;If They Could See Us Now&quot;, and they both regretted not taking him on holiday with them before he died (although Albert never held a passport). Damien, as a joke, hides Cassandra&#x27;s birth control pills in Albert&#x27;s urn.

Originally, the final episode of Only Fools and Horses was meant to be &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, with Del Boy leaving for Australia with new partner Jumbo Mills, Uncle Albert staying in Nelson Mandela House, and Rodney and Mickey Pearce taking over Trotters Independent Traders, but John Sullivan felt that this was not the end of the road for the Trotters. After the decision had been made, Albert was meant to be in until the final episode, &quot;Sleepless in Peckham&quot;, but, owing to Buster Merryfield&#x27;s death, the script had to be changed, and Uncle Albert died before the events of &quot;If They Could See Us Now&quot;.

Reportedly, John Sullivan had intended for a younger Uncle Albert to make an appearance in the prequel series &quot;Rock and Chips&quot; in flashbacks taking place before his fallout with Grandad, but Sullivan died after writing the series&#x27; third episode, &quot;The Frog and the Pussycat&quot;.

==After Merryfield&#x27;s death==
Merryfield died on 23 June 1999 from a brain tumour. During the 2001 Christmas special, &quot;If They Could See Us Now&quot;, Cassandra takes a phone call from Elsie Partridge&#x27;s son who informs them that Albert has died. Del and Rodney, who had since become millionaires, regretted not having taken him with them, but were consoled by the revelation that the &quot;Ancient Mariner&quot; never actually held a passport and at the same time showing up at the wrong funeral to someone else called Albert. In the 2002 special, &quot;Strangers on the Shore&quot;, the two scatter Albert&#x27;s ashes in the English Channel, before visiting the French village where Albert had been stationed for a time during the war only to find an entire town inhabited by bald men with white beards who all bore more than a passing resemblance to their late uncle (implied to all be children of his from his sexual proclivity at the time), they joked it should have been called &quot;Trottersville&quot;. In the 2003 special, &quot;Sleepless in Peckham&quot;, it was revealed that Albert had invested his share of the Trotter fortune in a safer area prior to his death. Coupled with his choice of a simple lifestyle, this meant Albert had around £290,000 at the time of his death, which he left to his two great nephews to invest. This was enough to save them from being evicted from Nelson Mandela House, and allow them to one day become millionaires once more.

Although Albert talks about his Naval career, he wore his ribbons in every episode.

<text>The Haunting is a 1963 British supernatural horror film directed and produced by Robert Wise, adapted by Nelson Gidding from Shirley Jackson&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;. It stars Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, and Russ Tamblyn. The film depicts the experiences of a small group of people invited by a paranormal investigator to investigate a purportedly haunted house.

Screenwriter Gidding, who had worked with director Wise on the 1958 film &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot in the UK, at the MGM-British Studios near London on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise, who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of &quot;The Haunting&quot;. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.

The film was released on 18 September 1963. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time. Director Martin Scorsese placed &quot;The Haunting&quot; first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. &quot;The Haunting&quot; was released on DVD in its original screen format with commentary in 2003, and was released on Blu-ray on 15 October 2013. The film was remade in 1999 by director Jan de Bont, starring Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson, but that version received generally negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Dr John Markway narrates the history of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was constructed in Massachusetts, United States, by Hugh Crain for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain&#x27;s daughter Abigail lived in the house for the rest of her life, never moving out of the nursery room. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was inherited by Mrs Sannerson, a distant relative of the companion, although the house has stood empty for some time.

Markway wishes to study the reported paranormal activity at Hill House and sends invitations for people to join his investigation; Mrs Sannerson demands that Markway allow her heir Luke Sannerson to join. Only two other individuals accept—Theodora, a psychic, and Eleanor Lance, who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. Eleanor has spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent death has left Eleanor with severe guilt.

The group find the mansion&#x27;s walls were constructed with angles askew, resulting in off-centre perspectives and doors that open and close by themselves. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by banging sounds made against the door, and hear menacing laughter. Luke and the doctor, however, report the house had been silent for them. In the morning, the words &quot;Help Eleanor come home&quot; are found scrawled on a wall, distressing Eleanor. The group explores the house, discovering a huge marble composite statue, supposedly of St Francis curing lepers, which seems to echo the string of characters who have lived in the house (Hugh Crain, Abigail and the companion), but also resemble Dr Markway, Luke, Theo and Eleanor.

The doctor, Luke and Theodora explore the library with the treacherous spiral staircase, but Eleanor has a severe reaction that prevents her from entering. Leaning over the veranda to look at the library&#x27;s tower, she becomes dizzy and is caught by Markway, who speculates that he should send her home, but Eleanor protests. Dr Markway discovers a cold spot outside the nursery room. Despite these occurrences, Eleanor feels an affinity to Hill House.

That night, on Markway&#x27;s insistence, Theo moves into Eleanor&#x27;s room, and they fall asleep in the twin beds pushed together. Eleanor is awakened by the voice of a man speaking and a woman laughing. Fearful, she asks Theo to hold her hand. As she hears the sound of a girl crying, she shouts. Theo awakens to find that Eleanor has moved from the bed to the couch, and Eleanor realises it was not Theo&#x27;s hand she held.

The following day Theo confronts Eleanor about her feelings for Dr Markway, and Eleanor lashes back at Theo for being &quot;unnatural,&quot; implying either Theo&#x27;s psychic ability to know what Eleanor is thinking or her attraction to Eleanor. Dr Markway&#x27;s sceptical wife Grace arrives with plans to join the group for the duration of the investigation, to the consternation of Eleanor, who had begun developing feelings for Markway while unaware that he was married. Grace demands a room in the nursery despite her husband&#x27;s warning that it is likely the centre of the disturbances. That night in the living room, the group experiences loud banging and an unseen intruder attempting to force its way into the room, causing the door to bulge inward. The banging moves toward the nursery, and Dr Markway pursues it as does Eleanor by using a different exit from the living room. Mrs Markway has disappeared and then Eleanor splits off from the group. Her instability worsens as she enters the library and climbs the spiral staircase, followed by Markway, who tries to coax her down despite the stairwell coming loose from the wall. At the top, Eleanor nearly falls to her death whilst glimpsing Grace above her. Markway grabs her and saves her. No-one believes she saw Grace.

Markway insists Eleanor leave but she pleads to stay, convinced the house wants her. If she leaves she thinks Grace will take her place. Eleanor drives off toward the front gates. The steering wheel begins to turn by itself, and she surrenders to the unseen force. A female figure suddenly appears in front of the car, causing Eleanor to crash into a tree and die. Markway and the others arrive to find that the figure is Grace, who says she woke in fear and tried to find her husband but the house kept her lost. She ended up in the attic when she was trying to find a way back, and Eleanor saw her through a trapdoor hatch. She is unsure of how she found her way outside. Luke observes that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree was the same one where Mrs Crain died. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house. Convinced of the supernatural forces he once scoffed at, Luke says about the house, &quot;It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.&quot;

==Production==
Robert Wise was in pre-production on &quot;West Side Story&quot; when he read a review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine of author Shirley Jackson&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter colleague Nelson Gidding, with whom he had worked on the film &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958). Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding to work on the adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding travelled to Bennington, Vermont, United States, to meet Jackson, who told them that it was a good idea but that the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor&#x27;s mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit to speak with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested &quot;The Haunting&quot;, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.

===Script===
Writing the screenplay took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, and although he passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on the screenplay was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the backstory was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and the greater part of the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience&#x27;s feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor&#x27;s role as an outcast was also emphasised. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humour in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor&#x27;s outsider status. The role of Luke became more flippant, and Dr Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

Wise approached United Artists with the project, but after much delay they turned him down. Wise&#x27;s agent then suggested that, since Wise owed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) a film under an old contract, Wise should take the project there. MGM agreed, but would only give Wise a $1 million budget. Wise knew he could not do the film at MGM&#x27;s Culver City Studios (now the Sony Pictures Studios), so he took it to England, as the Eady Levy gave tax breaks and financing to films made there as a way of subsidising and promoting the British film industry. Someone suggested to Wise that he approach MGM&#x27;s Borehamwood Studios subsidiary. Wise had been asked to come to the United Kingdom for a Royal Command Performance of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and during the trip made the financing pitch to MGM Borehamwood. They offered a budget of $1.050 million. With the Eady Levy support, this allowed the film to go forward with production in the United Kingdom.

===Casting===

Although Susan Hayward was reported to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Vance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor&#x27;s mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. The decision to cast Bloom and Richard Johnson was in part because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom&#x27;s Theodora character appear more bohemian, mod fashion designer Mary Quant was hired to design clothing specifically for Bloom&#x27;s character.

Richard Johnson, under contract to MGM, was cast as Dr Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;The Devils&quot;. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told him to keep his eyes steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would take care of that in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance. Russ Tamblyn, also under contract to MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was &quot;a jerk&quot;, although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension. Tamblyn told the cinema magazine &quot;Film Review&quot; in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. &quot;This is the ironic part&quot;, he said, &quot;it turned out to be one of my favourite films that I&#x27;ve been in!&quot;

Stunt performer Connie Tilton appears twice in the film. She portrays the death of the &quot;Second Mrs Crain&quot; by flinging herself backward down a flight of stairs. Uncredited actress Freda Knorr is seen in shots before and after the fall; it is her face audiences associate with the &quot;Second Mrs Crain&quot;. Tilton also appears when Abigail Crain&#x27;s Nurse-Companion hangs herself at the top of the spiral staircase in the library. Although uncredited actress Rosemary Dorken is seen climbing the stairs and going past the camera, it is Tilton&#x27;s body that suddenly appears in shot again as the Nurse-Companion hangs herself.

===Filming===

Wise called &quot;The Haunting&quot; one of his top ten or twelve favourites among the films he made, commenting that it was his favourite film-making experience. Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel), with its grounds near the village of Ettington, Warwickshire, was used for exterior shots of Hill House. Production designer Elliot Scott toured the country to look at possible candidates for Hill House, and Wise approved Scott&#x27;s choice of Ettington Park. Some of the cast and crew were housed in Ettington Park during exterior shooting. However, the location did not sit well with Harris and Bloom who upon arriving at Ettington Park thought it was &quot;scary looking outside&quot;, and Wise had to reassure them. Interior sets were constructed and shot at the MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The interior sets were designed by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as a &quot;major contributor&quot; to &quot;The Haunting&quot;. The sets were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style. All rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film (this was unusual, as most film sets forgo ceilings to add in lighting and filming). Actor Richard Johnson said that the sets&#x27; eeriness created a &quot;subdued atmosphere&quot; among the cast and crew.

Wise says that his contract with MGM specified that the picture could only be shot in black-and-white, which Wise preferred for this genre of film. He attempted to make Ettington Park look more sinister through various lighting effects and camera settings, but this failed. Wise and Boulton then hit on the idea of using infrared film for establishing shots of the house. Infrared film stocks were quickly rushed to the location shoot from Belgium. The new film worked. Wise felt the infrared film brought out the &quot;striations of the stone&quot; and made the mansion look like &quot;more of a monster house&quot;. Wise very much wanted to make &quot;The Haunting&quot; a tribute to Val Lewton, the producer and writer under whom Wise had directed his first film (the supernatural horror picture &quot;Curse of the Cat People&quot;). Wise says that Lewton&#x27;s theory of horror was that people were more afraid of the unknown than things they could see. The decision to show little that was supernatural was made very early in the picture&#x27;s pre-production. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton also wanted to make distances in the film (such as hallways) look longer and darker than the audience would anticipate. Wise approached the Panavision company, and wanted an anamorphic, wide-angle lens. The only lens Panavision had was a 40mm. Wise learned that the company was working on a 30mm lens, but it contained distortions and was not ready. Wise kept pressing, and eventually Panavision turned over the 30mm lens on the condition that Wise signed a memorandum in which he acknowledged it was imperfect. Wise and Boulton also planned shots that kept the camera moving, utilised low-angle shots, and incorporated unusual pans and tracking shots. This led to some of the most active camera movements in Wise&#x27;s film career. To accentuate the feeling that the house was alive, exterior shots were filmed so that the windows appeared to be eyes.

During the shoot, Harris suffered from depression, and believed that her co-stars did not take the film as seriously as she did. At times, she would cry in her makeup chair prior to the day&#x27;s shoot. The other actors remember her as being distant, not a part of their socialising and joking, and Harris did not speak to Bloom during filming, which puzzled Bloom. Afterward, Harris told Bloom that the lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and the two women reconciled. Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters &quot;step on one another&#x27;s lines&quot;, allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished. On occasion, the characters simply talk at the same time.

To enhance the actors&#x27; performances during scenes in which they react to off-stage voices or sounds, Wise and his sound editors created a &quot;pre-scored&quot; soundtrack of voices and noises. These were played back during filming, and Wise says they greatly enhanced the acting performances. Although some sounds were replaced during post-production, the &quot;pre-scored&quot; sounds were left on the soundtrack just as the actors heard them. Sound editors collected and created sounds in an empty manor house for a week to create the pre-score. Some of the sounds are very low in the bass range, which can cause physical sensations at high volume.

===Effects and editing===
The film contains a number of special effects, many of which were achieved in ways not immediately obvious to the viewer. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against a large parlour door, bending it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of laminated wood; the strange buckling was simply the result of a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against it.

Two physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. Wise achieved this effect by using the staircase&#x27;s handrail as a makeshift dolly track: a camera was attached to the rail and then slowly allowed to slide down, with the speed of the descent controlled by a wire attached to the camera. The sequence was then reversed and run at high speed, which gave the final cut an unworldly feel. In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sannerson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state and is rescued by Dr Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios. The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase&#x27;s central support column. When the cable was slackened, elements of the stairway loosened up and moved freely. Conversely, when the cable was tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable. The effect disturbed the cast so much that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove that it was safe.

Other effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. Dissolves were then used to illustrate the ageing process. In another scene, the characters come across a &quot;cold spot&quot; in the haunted mansion. Wise had initially wanted the actors to simply play up &quot;the &#x27;quality of [being] cold&#x27; in [the] sequence&quot;, but he quickly recognised that an additional visual effect was needed to more clearly emphasise the temperature drop. To overcome the unique issue of having to &quot;photograph &#x27;nothing, Wise instructed the makeup department to apply a special makeup onto the actors. This makeup contained a compound that was usually invisible to the naked eye but that appeared under certain filters. When it came time to film, the actors walked onto the portion of the set that was supposed to represent the cold spot, and these filters were gradually drawn over the set&#x27;s lights. This gave the visual impression that the characters had turned pale due to a drop in temperature.

The camera work and editing are used with the intent of further heightening the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor&#x27;s viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film were also used to heighten the audience&#x27;s discomfort. There are a number of rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer&#x27;s sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Likewise, cutting on action is often violated—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, for example, only to show them entering the next room from the left—so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The film also lacks temporal clues, and there are few shots in which the audience can see out a window to determine whether it is night or day. In other instances, windows are visible but do little to establish temporality: for instance, when Eleanor is rescued by Dr Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.

&quot;The Haunting&quot; is notable for its lesbian character, Theodora. Although the character&#x27;s lesbianism is subtly mentioned in the novel, the film makes it explicit. The film is also one of the few Hollywood motion pictures of its day to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory. Theodora&#x27;s lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture. Had Theodora been heterosexual, Eleanor&#x27;s growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her. But with Theodora a clear lesbian, Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator. Originally, Gidding&#x27;s script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city. It is clear from the context that she has just broken off with her female lover: &quot;I hate you&quot; is written on the mirror in lipstick. Theodora is yelling curses at her out the window and more. However, Wise decided to cut the scene, believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit. According to Harris, film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor, in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious.

=== Music ===
The largely atonal orchestral score for the film was written by Oxford-born composer Humphrey Searle (1915-1982), a pupil of the modernist composer Anton Webern. Searle is considered to be one of the foremost pioneers of serial music in the United Kingdom. While Searle scored other films as well, he is primarily known as a composer of concert music, including symphonies, ballets and chamber music. As later demonstrated by William Friedkin&#x27;s use of the music by Krzysztof Penderecki in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) and Stanley Kubrick in &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), atonal music is often used effectively to underscore horror films. &quot;The Haunting&quot; is one of the first horror films to employ an original score written in this idiom. Searle&#x27;s music was never released as a commercial soundtrack album, however The Westminster Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Kenneth Alwyn, recorded a selection from the score, reconstructed by Philip Lane, featured on the 1996 Silva Screen Records compilation album &quot;Horror!&quot;

==Release==
===Critical reception===
&quot;The Haunting&quot; first opened in the US, in New York and Los Angeles on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends went to see the film, which proved so frightening that afterwards, the group spent 15 minutes looking for the contents of their purses, which had spilled onto the floor over the course of the movie as the women jumped out of their seats from fear. In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100. Despite these stunts, &quot;The Haunting&quot; was only an average success at the box office.

&quot;The Haunting&quot; opened to mixed reception, the consensus generally being that it was a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. &quot;Variety&quot; called the acting effective, Davis Boulton&#x27;s cinematography extraordinarily dextrous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott&#x27;s production design of the &quot;monstrous&quot; house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding&#x27;s screenplay had &quot;major shortcomings&quot; in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited &quot;The Haunting&quot; as &quot;one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced&quot; but surmised that &quot;there is really no point to it&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine, critic Pauline Kael called the film &quot;moderately elegant and literate and expensive&quot;, but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being &quot;feeble [and] cowardly-comic&quot;. She considered the film to be superior to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;, also released in 1963, yet didn&#x27;t consider it to be a great film. Kael said of it, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a great movie but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at &quot;The Haunting&quot; wasn&#x27;t merely bored, it was hostile—as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn&#x27;t have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I&#x27;ve never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies… But the few scattered people at &quot;The Haunting&quot; were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing—the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that something would happen. In their terms, they were cheated: nothing happened. And, of course, they missed what was happening all along, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that the real things are physical.&quot;

A decidedly mixed-to-negative review came from Shirley Jackson, the author of the source novel. After seeing the film at a preview screening, she told her parents that &quot;it is actually a very poor movie, the plot of the book changed radically, and far too much talk&quot;, although she admitted that the film contained some frightening scenes and had praise for the art direction and cinematography. After a second viewing a few weeks later, she told her friend Libbie Burke that she and her son Barry &quot;nearly went to sleep&quot;, and that the scariest part of the day was that she had been given a parking ticket while inside the theatre.

The film&#x27;s stature and following have grown steadily since its original release. Director Martin Scorsese placed &quot;The Haunting&quot; first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Richard Johnson says that Steven Spielberg considers &quot;The Haunting&quot; one of the &quot;seminal films&quot; of his youth, and Robert Wise says that Spielberg told him &quot;The Haunting&quot; was &quot;the scariest film ever made!&quot; Richard Armstrong in &quot;Rough Guide to Film&quot; (2007) called it &quot;one of the most frightening films ever made&quot;, and said Julie Harris&#x27; performance is played &quot;with an intensity that is frightening in itself&quot;. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time. However, not all critics think so highly of the film; Yoram Allon and Neil LaBute have stated that they believe the film is &quot;frankly overrated&quot;, and filmmaker Russell Evans has argued that few people truly find the film shocking or disturbing. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes scores the film with an 87% rating based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Both psychological and supernatural, &quot;The Haunting&quot; is a chilling character study.&quot; The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director (Robert Wise).

In 2010, &quot;Cinema Retro&quot; magazine hosted a screening of the film at Ettington Park, the country house used for exterior shots of Hill House. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a question and answer session prior to the screening. Johnson said that he had never actually set foot in the hall during filming, and that this was the first occasion he had actually been inside the premises.

===Home media===
In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner announced he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures to make them more pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner&#x27;s colourisation facilities as a member of the Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising &quot;The Haunting&quot;. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by pointing to his contract, which stated the picture could only be in black-and-white.

Warner Home Video released the film on VHS in pan-and-scan format in 1998. It was released on DVD in its original screen format in 2003. The DVD release included voice-over commentary from Wise, Gidding, Bloom, Harris, Johnson and Tamblyn. The film was released on Blu-ray with the same commentary track on 15 October 2013.

==Remakes==
A remake of the film was attempted in the early 1990s by horror author Stephen King. King pitched the project under the name &quot;Rose Red&quot; to Steven Spielberg. The project went into turnaround and a complete script was written, but Spielberg demanded more thrills and action sequences while King wanted more horror. King and Spielberg mutually agreed to shelve the project after several years of work, and King bought back the rights to the script. King returned to the project in 1999, completed a revised script, and successfully pitched the script to producer Mark Carliner. King&#x27;s revised script aired as a miniseries titled &quot;Rose Red&quot; in 2002, but bears only superficial resemblance to &quot;The Haunting&quot;.

&quot;The Haunting&quot; was formally remade in 1999 under the same title. Horror director Wes Craven initially worked on the project, but abandoned it. This adaptation, directed by Jan de Bont, starred Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson and Lili Taylor in the roles of Markway (now named Marrow), Theo, Luke and Eleanor.

<text>Fongshan District () is a district located in southern Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Fongshan is one of the administrative centers of Kaohsiung and is home to the Republic of China Military Academy. There are three military units currently located in Fongshan. Both the Republic of China Military Academy and R.O.C. Army Infantry School came to Taiwan from mainland China and were re-established here in 1950. Chung Cheng Armed Forces Preparatory School was established in 1976. These three units used to be the main economic driving force, but their importance diminished gradually as Fongshan has established itself as a conjunction between Pingtung City and Kaohsiung.

Although there are several industrial zones at the outskirts of the city, the major lifestyle in Fongshan seems to be very residential. Many apartments were built near the Kaohsiung city center as a result of shifting economic weight. Like most of areas in Taiwan, it also has many night markets scattered around within the city. Most of the night markets run until 2:00 am. Some of them are open on different days of a week, but some others are open all year round. Some of them are temporary, while others have become permanent establishments.

==History==
During the Dutch era, the current location of Fongshan was called &quot;Pongsoya&quot; (see Linbian, Pingtung), a group of eight Makatao villages and one of the most populous areas of Taiwan.

===Qing Dynasty===
During Qing rule, included areas south of Tainan (then called &quot;Taiwan-fu&quot;) and west of the mountains. In 1875, the southern part of Fongshan County was separated into .

===Empire of Japan===
In 1901, during Japanese rule, was one of twenty local administrative offices established. According to the 1904 census, Hozan town had a population of 5,750, whereas Hozan District had a population 173,016. In 1909, this unit was merged into . From 1920 to 1945, under the prefecture system, was administered under Hōzan District, Takao Prefecture. After the colonial government started to develop Takao Harbor in the early 20th century, the importance of Fongshan declined.

===Republic of China===
Fongshan was the capital of Kaohsiung County, and was established in 1945 as an urban township. It was upgraded to a county-administered city on 1 July 1972. On 24 December 2010, it was upgraded to a district and along with Lingya District has been the city seat of Kaohsiung City since that time.

<doc id="950939" wikidata="Q1137223" url="?curid=950939" title="Equal Protection Clause">
<text>The Equal Protection Clause is part of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The clause, which took effect in 1868, provides &quot;nor shall any State... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; It mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated equally by the law.

A primary motivation for this clause was to validate the equality provisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which guaranteed that all citizens would have the right to equal protection by law. As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism, by applying substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the Civil War.

The meaning of the Equal Protection Clause has been the subject of much debate, and inspired the well-known phrase &quot;Equal Justice Under Law&quot;. This clause was the basis for &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the Supreme Court decision that helped to dismantle racial segregation. The clause has also been the basis for &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges,&quot; which legalized same-sex marriages, along with many other decisions rejecting discrimination against, and bigotry towards, people belonging to various groups.

While the Equal Protection Clause itself applies only to state and local governments, the Supreme Court held in &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; (1954) that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment nonetheless requires equal protection under the laws of the federal government via reverse incorporation.

==Text==
The Equal Protection Clause is located at the end of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment: &quot;No state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot;

==Background==

Though equality under the law is an American legal tradition arguably dating to the Declaration of Independence, formal equality for many groups remained elusive. Before passage of the Reconstruction Amendments, which included the Equal Protection Clause, American law did not extend constitutional rights to black Americans. Black people were considered inferior to white Americans, and subject to chattel slavery in the slave states until the Emancipation Proclamation and the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. 

Even black Americans that were not enslaved lacked many crucial legal protections. In the 1857 &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; decision, the Supreme Court rejected abolitionism and determined black men, whether free or in bondage, had no legal rights under the U.S. Constitution at the time. Currently, a plurality of historians believe that this judicial decision set the United States on the path to the Civil War, which led to the ratifications of the Reconstruction Amendments.  

Before and during the Civil War, the Southern states prohibited speech of pro-Union citizens, anti-slavery advocates, and northerners in general, since the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states during such times. During the Civil War, many of the Southern states stripped the state citizenship of many whites and banished them from their state, effectively seizing their property.
Shortly after the Union victory in the American Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment was proposed by Congress and ratified by the states in 1865, abolishing slavery. Subsequently, many ex-Confederate states then adopted Black Codes following the war, with these laws severely restricting the rights of blacks to hold property, including real property (such as real estate), and many forms of personal property, and to form legally enforceable contracts. Such codes also established harsher criminal consequences for blacks than for whites.

Because of the inequality imposed by Black Codes, a Republican-controlled Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Act provided that all persons born in the United States were citizens (contrary to the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1857 decision in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;), and required that &quot;citizens of every race and color ... [have] full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.&quot;

President Andrew Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 amid concerns (among other things) that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to enact such a bill. Such doubts were one factor that led Congress to begin to draft and debate what would become the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Additionally, Congress wanted to protect white Unionists who were under personal and legal attack in the former Confederacy. The effort was led by the Radical Republicans of both houses of Congress, including John Bingham, Charles Sumner, and Thaddeus Stevens. It was the most influential of these men, John Bingham, who was the principal author and drafter of the Equal Protection Clause.

The Southern states were opposed to the Civil Rights Act, but in 1865 Congress, exercising its power under Article I, Section 5, Clause 1 of the Constitution, to &quot;be the Judge of the ... Qualifications of its own Members&quot;, had excluded Southerners from Congress, declaring that their states, having rebelled against the Union, could therefore not elect members to Congress. It was this fact—the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted by a &quot;rump&quot; Congress—that permitted the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment by Congress and subsequently proposed to the states. The ratification of the amendment by the former Confederate states was imposed as a condition of their acceptance back into the Union.

== Ratification ==
With the return to originalist interpretations of the Constitution, many wonder what was intended by the framers of the reconstruction amendments at the time of their ratification. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery but to what extent it protected other rights was unclear. After the Thirteenth Amendment the South began to institute Black Codes which were restrictive laws seeking to keep black Americans in a position of inferiority. The Fourteenth amendment was ratified by nervous Republicans in response to the rise of Black Codes. This ratification was irregular in many ways. First, there were multiple states that rejected the Fourteenth Amendment, but when their new governments were created due to reconstruction, these new governments accepted the amendment. There were also two states, Ohio and New Jersey, that accepted the amendment and then later passed resolutions rescinding that acceptance. The nullification of the two states&#x27; acceptance was considered illegitimate and both Ohio and New Jersey were included in those counted as ratifying the amendment.

Many historians have argued that Fourteenth Amendment was not originally intended to grant sweeping political and social rights to the citizens but instead to solidify the constitutionality of the 1866 Civil rights Act. While it is widely agreed that this was a key reason for the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, many historians adopt a much wider view. It is a popular interpretation that the Fourteenth Amendment was always meant to ensure equal rights for all those in the United States. This argument was used by Charles Sumner when he used the Fourteenth Amendment as the basis for his arguments to expand the protections afforded to black Americans.

Although the equal protection clause is one of the most cited ideas in legal theory, it received little attention during the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead the key tenet of the Fourteenth Amendment at the time of its ratification was the Privileges or Immunities Clause. This clause sought to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens which now included black men. The scope of this clause was substantially narrowed following the Slaughterhouse Cases in which it was determined that a citizen&#x27;s privileges and immunities were only ensured at the Federal level and that it was government overreach to impose this standard on the states. Even in this halting decision the Court still acknowledged the context in which the Amendment was passed, stating that knowing the evils and injustice the Fourteenth Amendment was meant to combat is key in our legal understanding of its implications and purpose. With the abridgment of the Privileges or Immunities clause, legal arguments aimed at protecting black American&#x27;s rights became more complex and that is when the equal protection clause started to gain attention for the arguments it could enhance.  

During the debate in Congress, more than one version of the clause was considered. Here is the first version: &quot;The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to secure ... to all persons in the several states equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property.&quot; Bingham said about this version: &quot;It confers upon Congress power to see to it that the protection given by the laws of the States shall be equal in respect to life and liberty and property to all persons.&quot; The main opponent of the first version was Congressman Robert S. Hale of New York, despite Bingham&#x27;s public assurances that &quot;under no possible interpretation can it ever be made to operate in the State of New York while she occupies her present proud position.&quot;

Hale ended up voting for the final version, however. When Senator Jacob Howard introduced that final version, he said:

It prohibits the hanging of a black man for a crime for which the white man is not to be hanged. It protects the black man in his fundamental rights as a citizen with the same shield which it throws over the white man. Ought not the time to be now passed when one measure of justice is to be meted out to a member of one caste while another and a different measure is meted out to the member of another caste, both castes being alike citizens of the United States, both bound to obey the same laws, to sustain the burdens of the same Government, and both equally responsible to justice and to God for the deeds done in the body?

The 39th United States Congress proposed the Fourteenth Amendment on June 13, 1866. A difference between the initial and final versions of the clause was that the final version spoke not just of &quot;equal protection&quot; but of &quot;the equal protection of the laws&quot;. John Bingham said in January 1867: &quot;no State may deny to any person the equal protection of the laws, including all the limitations for personal protection of every article and section of the Constitution...&quot; By July 9, 1868, three-fourths of the states (28 of 37) ratified the amendment, and that is when the Equal Protection Clause became law.

==Early history following ratification==
Bingham said in a speech on March 31, 1871 that the clause meant no State could deny anyone &quot;the equal protection of the Constitution of the United States ... [or] any of the rights which it guarantees to all men&quot;, nor deny to anyone &quot;any right secured to him either by the laws and treaties of the United States or of such State.&quot; At that time, the meaning of equality varied from one state to another.

Four of the original thirteen states never passed any laws barring interracial marriage, and the other states were divided on the issue in the Reconstruction era. In 1872, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the state&#x27;s ban on mixed-race marriage violated the &quot;cardinal principle&quot; of the 1866 Civil Rights Act and of the Equal Protection Clause. Almost a hundred years would pass before the U.S. Supreme Court followed that Alabama case (&quot;Burns v. State&quot;) in the case of &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;. In &quot;Burns&quot;, the Alabama Supreme Court said:

Marriage is a civil contract, and in that character alone is dealt with by the municipal law. The same right to make a contract as is enjoyed by white citizens, means the right to make any contract which a white citizen may make. The law intended to destroy the distinctions of race and color in respect to the rights secured by it.

As for public schooling, no states during this era of Reconstruction actually required separate schools for blacks. However, some states (e.g. New York) gave local districts discretion to set up schools that were deemed separate but equal. In contrast, Iowa and Massachusetts flatly prohibited segregated schools ever since the 1850s.

Likewise, some states were more favorable to women&#x27;s legal status than others; New York, for example, had been giving women full property, parental, and widow&#x27;s rights since 1860, but not the right to vote. No state or territory allowed women&#x27;s suffrage when the Equal Protection Clause took effect in 1868. In contrast, at that time African American men had full voting rights in five states.

==Gilded Age interpretation and the &quot;Plessy&quot; decision==
In the United States, 1877 marked the end of Reconstruction and the start of the Gilded Age. The first truly landmark equal protection decision by the Supreme Court was &quot;Strauder v. West Virginia&quot; (1880). A black man convicted of murder by an all-white jury challenged a West Virginia statute excluding blacks from serving on juries. Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been &quot;drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [the defendant&#x27;s] race.&quot; At the same time, the Court explicitly allowed sexism and other types of discrimination, saying that states &quot;may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons having educational qualifications. We do not believe the Fourteenth Amendment was ever intended to prohibit this. ... Its aim was against discrimination because of race or color.&quot;

The next important postwar case was the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; (1883), in which the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was at issue. The Act provided that all persons should have &quot;full and equal enjoyment of ... inns, public conveyances on land or water, theatres, and other places of public amusement.&quot; In its opinion, the Court explicated what has since become known as the &quot;state action doctrine&quot;, according to which the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause apply only to acts done or otherwise &quot;sanctioned in some way&quot; by the state. Prohibiting blacks from attending plays or staying in inns was &quot;simply a private wrong&quot;. Justice John Marshall Harlan dissented alone, saying, &quot;I cannot resist the conclusion that the substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism.&quot; Harlan went on to argue that because (1) &quot;public conveyances on land and water&quot; use the public highways, and (2) innkeepers engage in what is &quot;a quasi-public employment&quot;, and (3) &quot;places of public amusement&quot; are licensed under the laws of the states, excluding blacks from using these services &quot;was&quot; an act sanctioned by the state.
A few years later, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Yick Wo v. Hopkins&quot; (1886). In it the word &quot;person&quot; from the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s section has been given the broadest possible meaning by the U.S. Supreme Court:

These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.

Thus, the clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and nationalities such as (in this case) legal aliens in the United States who are Chinese citizens.

In its most contentious Gilded Age interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana Jim Crow law that required the segregation of blacks and whites on railroads and mandated separate railway cars for members of the two races. The Court, speaking through Justice Henry B. Brown, ruled that the Equal Protection Clause had been intended to defend equality in civil rights, not equality in social arrangements. All that was therefore required of the law was reasonableness, and Louisiana&#x27;s railway law amply met that requirement, being based on &quot;the established usages, customs and traditions of the people.&quot; Justice Harlan again dissented. &quot;Every one knows,&quot; he wrote,

Such &quot;arbitrary separation&quot; by race, Harlan concluded, was &quot;a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality before the law established by the Constitution.&quot; Harlan&#x27;s philosophy of constitutional colorblindness would eventually become more widely accepted, especially after World War II.

==Rights of Corporations==
In the decades after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the vast majority of Supreme Court cases interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment dealt with the rights of corporations, not with the rights of African Americans. In the period 1868–1912 (from ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the first known published count by a scholar), the Supreme Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment in 312 cases dealing with the rights of corporations but in only 28 cases dealing with the rights of African Americans. Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment was used primarily by corporations to attack laws that regulated corporations, not to protect the formerly enslaved people from racial discrimination. Granting rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to business corporations was introduced into Supreme Court jurisprudence through a series of sleights of hands. Roscoe Conkling, a skillful lawyer and former powerful politicians who had served as a member of the United States Congressional Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which had drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, was the lawyer who argued an important case known as &quot;San Mateo County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot; before the Supreme Court in 1882. In this case, the issue was whether corporations are &quot;persons&quot; within the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Conkling argued that corporations were included in the meaning of the term person and thus entitled to such rights. He told the Court that he, as a member of the Committee that drafted this amendment to the Constitutional, knew that this is what the Committee had intended. Legal historians in the 20th Century examined the history of the drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment and found that Conkling had fabricated the notion that the Committee had intended the term &quot;person&quot; of the Fourteenth Amendment to encompass corporations. This &quot;San Mateo&quot; case was settled by the parties without the Supreme Court issuing an opinion however the Court&#x27;s misunderstanding of the intention of the Amendment&#x27;s drafters that had been created by Conkling&#x27;s likely deliberate deception was never corrected at the time.

A second fraud occurred a few years later in the case of &quot;Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot;, which left a written legacy of corporate rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. J. C. Bancroft Davis, an attorney and the Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, drafted the &quot;syllabus&quot; (summary) of Supreme Court decisions and the &quot;headnotes&quot; that summarized key points of law held by the Court. These were published before each case as part of the official court publication communicating the law of the land as held by the Supreme Court. A headnote that Davis as court reporter published immediately preceding the court opinion in Santa Clara case stated:

Davis added before the opinion of the Court: 
In fact, the Supreme Court decided the case on narrower grounds and had specifically avoided this Constitutional issue.

===The Supreme Court holding===
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field seized on this deceptive and incorrect published summary by the court reporter Davis in &quot;Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot; and cited that case as precedent in the 1889 case &quot;Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway Company v. Beckwith&quot; in support of the proposition that corporations are entitled to equal protection of the law within the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Writing the opinion for the Court in &quot;Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway Company v. Beckwith&quot;, Justice Field reasoned that a corporation is an association of its human shareholders and thus has rights under the Fourteenth Amendment just as the members of the association.

In this Supreme Court case &quot;Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway Company v. Beckwith&quot;, Justice Field, writing for the Court, thus took this point as established Constitutional law. In the decades that followed, the Supreme Court often continued to cite and to rely on &quot;Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot; as established precedent that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed equal protection of the law and due process rights for corporations, even though in the Santa Clara case the Supreme Court held or stated no such thing. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the clause was used to strike down numerous statutes applying to corporations. Since the New Deal, however, such invalidations have been rare.

==Between &quot;Plessy&quot; and &quot;Brown&quot;==
In &quot;Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada&quot; (1938), Lloyd Gaines was a black student at Lincoln University of Missouri, one of the historically black colleges in Missouri. He applied for admission to the law school at the all-white University of Missouri, since Lincoln did not have a law school, but was denied admission due solely to his race. The Supreme Court, applying the separate-but-equal principle of &quot;Plessy&quot;, held that a State offering a legal education to whites but not to blacks violated the Equal Protection Clause.

In &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948), the Court showed increased willingness to find racial discrimination illegal. The &quot;Shelley&quot; case concerned a privately made contract that prohibited &quot;people of the Negro or Mongolian race&quot; from living on a particular piece of land. Seeming to go against the spirit, if not the exact letter, of &quot;The Civil Rights Cases&quot;, the Court found that, although a discriminatory private contract could not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the courts&#x27; &quot;enforcement&quot; of such a contract could; after all, the Supreme Court reasoned, courts were part of the state.

The companion cases &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; and &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;, both decided in 1950, paved the way for a series of school integration cases. In &quot;McLaurin&quot;, the University of Oklahoma had admitted McLaurin, an African-American, but had restricted his activities there: he had to sit apart from the rest of the students in the classrooms and library, and could eat in the cafeteria only at a designated table. A unanimous Court, through Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, said that Oklahoma had deprived McLaurin of the equal protection of the laws:

The present situation, Vinson said, was the former. In &quot;Sweatt&quot;, the Court considered the constitutionality of Texas&#x27;s state system of law schools, which educated blacks and whites at separate institutions. The Court (again through Chief Justice Vinson, and again with no dissenters) invalidated the school system—not because it separated students, but rather because the separate facilities were not &quot;equal&quot;. They lacked &quot;substantial equality in the educational opportunities&quot; offered to their students.

All of these cases, as well as the upcoming &quot;Brown&quot; case, were litigated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It was Charles Hamilton Houston, a Harvard Law School graduate and law professor at Howard University, who in the 1930s first began to challenge racial discrimination in the federal courts. Thurgood Marshall, a former student of Houston&#x27;s and the future Solicitor General and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, joined him. Both men were extraordinarily skilled appellate advocates, but part of their shrewdness lay in their careful choice of &quot;which&quot; cases to litigate, selecting the best legal proving grounds for their cause.

==&quot;Brown&quot; and its consequences==

In 1954 the contextualization of the equal protection clause would change forever. The Supreme Court itself recognized the gravity of the Brown v Board decision acknowledging that a split decision would be a threat to the role of the Supreme Court and even to the country. When Earl Warren became Chief Justice in 1953, &quot;Brown&quot; had already come before the Court. While Vinson was still Chief Justice, there had been a preliminary vote on the case at a conference of all nine justices. At that time, the Court had split, with a majority of the justices voting that school segregation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Warren, however, through persuasion and good-natured cajoling—he had been an extremely successful Republican politician before joining the Court—was able to convince all eight associate justices to join his opinion declaring school segregation unconstitutional. In that opinion, Warren wrote:

Warren discouraged other justices, such as Robert H. Jackson, from publishing any concurring opinion; Jackson&#x27;s draft, which emerged much later (in 1988), included this statement: &quot;Constitutions are easier amended than social customs, and even the North never fully conformed its racial practices to its professions&quot;. The Court set the case for re-argument on the question of how to implement the decision. In &quot;Brown II&quot;, decided in 1954, it was concluded that since the problems identified in the previous opinion were local, the solutions needed to be so as well. Thus the court devolved authority to local school boards and to the trial courts that had originally heard the cases. (&quot;Brown&quot; was actually a consolidation of four different cases from four different states.) The trial courts and localities were told to desegregate with &quot;all deliberate speed&quot;.

Partly because of that enigmatic phrase, but mostly because of self-declared &quot;massive resistance&quot; in the South to the desegregation decision, integration did not begin in any significant way until the mid-1960s and then only to a small degree. In fact, much of the integration in the 1960s happened in response not to &quot;Brown&quot; but to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court intervened a handful of times in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its next major desegregation decision was not until &quot;Green v. School Board of New Kent County&quot; (1968), in which Justice William J. Brennan, writing for a unanimous Court, rejected a &quot;freedom-of-choice&quot; school plan as inadequate. This was a significant decision; freedom-of-choice plans had been very common responses to &quot;Brown&quot;. Under these plans, parents could choose to send their children to either a formerly white or a formerly black school. Whites almost never opted to attend black-identified schools, however, and blacks rarely attended white-identified schools.

In response to &quot;Green&quot;, many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; because residential segregation was widespread, little integration was accomplished. In 1971, the Court in &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; approved busing as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, in the case of &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students &quot;between&quot; districts, instead of merely &quot;within&quot; a district. &quot;Milliken&quot; basically ended the Supreme Court&#x27;s major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in school desegregation cases, many of which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s.

The curtailment of busing in &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; is one of several reasons that have been cited to explain why equalized educational opportunity in the United States has fallen short of completion. In the view of various liberal scholars, the election of Richard Nixon in 1968 meant that the executive branch was no longer behind the Court&#x27;s constitutional commitments. Also, the Court itself decided in &quot;San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez&quot; (1973) that the Equal Protection Clause allows—but does not require—a state to provide equal educational funding to all students within the state. Moreover, the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot; (1925) allowed families to opt out of public schools, despite &quot;inequality in economic resources that made the option of private schools available to some and not to others&quot;, as Martha Minow has put it.

American public school systems, especially in large metropolitan areas, to a large extent are still &quot;de facto&quot; segregated. Whether due to &quot;Brown&quot;, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In &quot;Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1&quot; (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.

==Application to federal government==
By its terms, the clause restrains only state governments. However, the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s due process guarantee, beginning with &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; (1954), has been interpreted as imposing some of the same restrictions on the federal government: &quot;Though the Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause, as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the States, the concepts of equal protection and due process are not mutually exclusive.&quot; In &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003) the Supreme Court added: &quot;Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests&quot;
Some scholars have argued that the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bolling&quot; should have been reached on other grounds. For example, Michael W. McConnell has written that Congress never &quot;required that the schools of the District of Columbia be segregated.&quot; According to that rationale, the segregation of schools in Washington D.C. was unauthorized and therefore illegal.

The federal government has at times shared its power to discriminate against noncitizens with states through cooperative federalism. It has done so in the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program.

==Tiered scrutiny==
Despite the undoubted importance of &quot;Brown&quot;, much of modern equal protection jurisprudence originated in other cases, though not everyone agrees about &quot;which&quot; other cases. Many scholars assert that the opinion of Justice Harlan Stone in &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot; (1938) contained a footnote that was a critical turning point for equal protection jurisprudence, but that assertion is disputed.

Whatever its precise origins, the basic idea of the modern approach is that more judicial scrutiny is triggered by purported discrimination that involves &quot;fundamental rights&quot; (such as the right to procreation), and similarly more judicial scrutiny is also triggered if the purported victim of discrimination has been targeted because he or she belongs to a &quot;suspect classification&quot; (such as a single racial group). This modern doctrine was pioneered in &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot; (1942), which involved depriving certain criminals of the fundamental right to procreate:

When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offense and sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.

Until 1976, the Supreme Court usually ended up dealing with discrimination by using one of two possible levels of scrutiny: what has come to be called &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; (when a suspect class or fundamental right is involved), or instead the more lenient &quot;rational basis review&quot;. Strict scrutiny means that a challenged statute must be &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to serve a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest, and must not have a &quot;less restrictive&quot; alternative. In contrast, rational basis scrutiny merely requires that a challenged statute be &quot;reasonably related&quot; to a &quot;legitimate&quot; government interest.

However, in the 1976 case of &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot;, the Court added another tier of scrutiny, called &quot;intermediate scrutiny&quot;, regarding gender discrimination. The Court may have added other tiers too, such as &quot;enhanced rational basis&quot; scrutiny, and &quot;exceedingly persuasive basis&quot; scrutiny.

All of this is known as &quot;tiered&quot; scrutiny, and it has had many critics, including Justice Thurgood Marshall who argued for a &quot;spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination&quot;, instead of discrete tiers. Justice John Paul Stevens argued for only one level of scrutiny, given that &quot;there is only one Equal Protection Clause&quot;. The whole tiered strategy developed by the Court is meant to reconcile the principle of equal protection with the reality that most laws necessarily discriminate in some way.

Choosing the standard of scrutiny can determine the outcome of a case, and the strict scrutiny standard is often described as &quot;strict in theory and fatal in fact&quot;. In order to select the correct level of scrutiny, Justice Antonin Scalia urged the Court to identify rights as &quot;fundamental&quot; or identify classes as &quot;suspect&quot; by analyzing what was understood when the Equal Protection Clause was adopted, instead of based upon more subjective factors.

==Discriminatory intent and disparate impact==

Because inequalities can be caused either intentionally or unintentionally, the Supreme Court has decided that the Equal Protection Clause itself does not forbid governmental policies that unintentionally lead to racial disparities, though Congress may have some power under other clauses of the Constitution to address unintentional disparate impacts. This subject was addressed in the seminal case of &quot;Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.&quot; (1977). In that case, the plaintiff, a housing developer, sued a city in the suburbs of Chicago that had refused to re-zone a plot of land on which the plaintiff intended to build low-income, racially integrated housing. On the face, there was no clear evidence of racially discriminatory intent on the part of Arlington Heights&#x27;s planning commission. The result was racially disparate, however, since the refusal supposedly prevented mostly African-Americans and Hispanics from moving in. Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the Court, stated, &quot;Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.&quot; Disparate impact merely has an evidentiary value; absent a &quot;stark&quot; pattern, &quot;impact is not determinative.&quot; 

The result in &quot;Arlington Heights&quot; was similar to that in &quot;Washington v. Davis&quot; (1976), and has been defended on the basis that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to guarantee equal outcomes, but rather equal opportunities; if a legislature wants to correct unintentional but racially disparate effects, it may be able to do so through further legislation. It is possible for a discriminating state to hide its true intention, and one possible solution is for disparate impact to be considered as stronger evidence of discriminatory intent. This debate, though, is currently academic, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in &quot;Arlington Heights&quot;.

For an example of how this rule limits the Court&#x27;s powers under the Equal Protection Clause, see &quot;McClesky v. Kemp&quot; (1987). In that case a black man was convicted of murdering a white police officer and sentenced to death in the state of Georgia. A study found that killers of whites were more likely to be sentenced to death than were killers of blacks. The Court found that the defense had failed to prove that such data demonstrated the requisite discriminatory intent by the Georgia legislature and executive branch.

The &quot;Stop and Frisk&quot; policy in New York allows officers to stop anyone who they feel looks suspicious. Data from police stops shows that even when controlling for variability, people who are black and those of Hispanic descent were stopped more frequently than white people, with these statistics dating back to the late 1990s. A term that has been created to describe the disproportionate number of police stops of black people is &quot;Driving While Black.&quot; This term is used to describe the stopping of innocent black people who are not committing any crime.

In addition to concerns that a discriminating statute can hide its true intention, there have also been concerns that facially neutral evaluative and statistical devices that are permitted by decision-makers can be subject to racial bias and unfair appraisals of ability.&#x27; As the equal protection doctrine heavily relies on the ability of neutral evaluative tools to engage in neutral selection procedures, racial biases indirectly permitted under the doctrine can have grave ramifications and result in &#x27;uneven conditions.&#x27; &#x27; These issues can be especially prominent in areas of public benefits, employment, and college admissions, etc.&#x27;

==Voting rights==
The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Nixon v. Herndon&quot; (1927) that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited denial of the vote based on race. The first modern application of the Equal Protection Clause to voting law came in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1962), where the Court ruled that the districts that sent representatives to the Tennessee state legislature were so malapportioned (with some legislators representing ten times the number of residents as others) that they violated the Equal Protection Clause.

It may seem counterintuitive that the Equal Protection Clause should provide for equal voting rights; after all, it would seem to make the Fifteenth Amendment and the Nineteenth Amendment redundant. Indeed, it was on this argument, as well as on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Justice John M. Harlan (the grandson of the earlier Justice Harlan) relied on in his dissent from &quot;Reynolds&quot;. Harlan quoted the congressional debates of 1866 to show that the framers did not intend for the Equal Protection Clause to extend to voting rights, and in reference to the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, he said:

Harlan also relied on the fact that Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment &quot;expressly recognizes the States&#x27; power to deny &#x27;or in any way&#x27; abridge the right of their inhabitants to vote for &#x27;the members of the [state] Legislature.&#x27;&quot; Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a specific federal response to such actions by a state: reduction of a state&#x27;s representation in Congress. However, the Supreme Court has instead responded that voting is a &quot;fundamental right&quot; on the same plane as marriage (&quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;); for any discrimination in fundamental rights to be constitutional, the Court requires the legislation to pass strict scrutiny. Under this theory, equal protection jurisprudence has been applied to voting rights.

A recent use of equal protection doctrine came in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in Florida in the aftermath of the 2000 presidential election. There, the Supreme Court held that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. The Supreme Court used four of its rulings from 1960s voting rights cases (one of which was &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;) to support its ruling in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices Souter and Breyer joined the majority of five—but only for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the remedy that the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.

==Sex, disability, and romantic orientation==
Originally, the Fourteenth Amendment did not forbid sex discrimination to the same extent as other forms of discrimination. On the one hand, Section Two of the amendment specifically discouraged states from interfering with the voting rights of &quot;males&quot;, which made the amendment anathema to many women when it was proposed in 1866. On the other hand, as feminists like Victoria Woodhull pointed out, the word &quot;person&quot; in the Equal Protection Clause was apparently chosen deliberately, instead of a masculine term that could have easily been used instead.

In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot;, extending the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect women from sex discrimination, in situations where there is no rational basis for the discrimination. That level of scrutiny was boosted to an intermediate level in &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot; (1976).

The Supreme Court has been disinclined to extend full &quot;suspect classification&quot; status (thus making a law that categorizes on that basis subject to greater judicial scrutiny) for groups other than racial minorities and religious groups. In &quot;City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.&quot; (1985), the Court refused to make the developmentally disabled a suspect class. Many commentators have noted, however—and Justice Thurgood Marshall so notes in his partial concurrence—that the Court did appear to examine the City of Cleburne&#x27;s denial of a permit to a group home for intellectually disabled people with a significantly higher degree of scrutiny than is typically associated with the rational-basis test.

The Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot; (1996) struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment aimed at denying homosexuals &quot;minority status, quota preferences, protected status or [a] claim of discrimination.&quot; The Court rejected as &quot;implausible&quot; the dissent&#x27;s argument that the amendment would not deprive homosexuals of general protections provided to everyone else but rather would merely prevent &quot;special treatment of homosexuals.&quot; Much as in &quot;City of Cleburne&quot;, the &quot;Romer&quot; decision seemed to employ a markedly higher level of scrutiny than the nominally applied rational-basis test.

In &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting homosexual sodomy on substantive due process grounds. In Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only &quot;homosexual&quot; sodomy, and not &quot;heterosexual&quot; sodomy as well, Texas&#x27;s statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited &quot;City of Cleburne&quot;, and also relied in part on &quot;Romer&quot;. Notably, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s opinion did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation.

While the courts have applied rational-basis scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, it has been argued that discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases. Other scholars disagree, arguing that &quot;homophobia&quot; is distinct from sexism, in a sociological sense, and so treating it as such would be an unacceptable judicial shortcut.

In 2013, the Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;. No state statute was in question, and therefore the Equal Protection Clause did not apply. The Court did employ similar principles, however, in combination with federalism principles. The Court did not purport to use any level of scrutiny more demanding than rational basis review, according to law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. The four dissenting justices argued that the authors of the statute were rational.

In 2015, the Supreme Court held in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and required all states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed in other jurisdictions.

==Affirmative action==

Affirmative action is the consideration of race, gender, or other factors, to benefit an underrepresented group or to address past injustices done to that group. Individuals who belong to the group are preferred over those who do not belong to the group, for example in educational admissions, hiring, promotions, awarding of contracts, and the like. Such action may be used as a &quot;tie-breaker&quot; if all other factors are inconclusive, or may be achieved through quotas, which allot a certain number of benefits to each group.

During Reconstruction, Congress enacted programs primarily to assist newly freed slaves who had personally been denied many advantages earlier in their lives, based on their former slave status, not necessarily their race or ethnicity. Such legislation was enacted by many of the same people who framed the Equal Protection Clause, though that clause did not apply to such federal legislation, and instead only applied to state legislation. However, now the Equal Protection Clause does apply to private universities and possibly other private businesses (particularly those who accept federal funds), in accordance with &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot; (2023).

Several important affirmative action cases to reach the Supreme Court have concerned government contractors—for instance, &quot;Adarand Constructors v. Peña&quot; (1995) and &quot;City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.&quot; (1989). But the most famous cases have dealt with affirmative action as practiced by public universities: &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; (1978), and two companion cases decided by the Supreme Court in 2003, &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot; and &quot;Gratz v. Bollinger&quot;.

In &quot;Bakke&quot;, the Court held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that educational institutions could legally use race as one of many factors to consider in their admissions process. In &quot;Grutter&quot; and &quot;Gratz&quot;, the Court upheld both &quot;Bakke&quot; as a precedent and the admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School. In &quot;dicta&quot;, however, Justice O&#x27;Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, racial preferences would no longer be necessary. In &quot;Gratz&quot;, the Court invalidated Michigan&#x27;s undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school&#x27;s policy, which treated race as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.

In these affirmative action cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or has said it employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action policies challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in &quot;Grutter&quot;, and a Harvard College admissions policy praised by Justice Powell&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Bakke&quot;, passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued—including Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent to &quot;Grutter&quot;—that the scrutiny the Court has applied in some cases is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one. On the other side, it is argued that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.

In &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot; (2023), and its companion case Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina (2023), the Supreme Court held that race and ethnicity cannot be used in admissions decisions. In other words, preferential treatment based on race or ethnicity violates The Equal Protection Clause. Although &quot;nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant&#x27;s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,&quot; Chief Justice Roberts made it clear that &quot;universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.&quot; Moreover, &quot;what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.&quot; These opinions effectively ended affirmative action in schools. Although the scope and reach of these opinions are unknown, it is not uncommon for Supreme Court cases&#x27; rationale to be applied to similar or analogous facts or circumstances.

<text>Yonghe District () is an urban area in the southern part of New Taipei, Taiwan. Yonghe District is the smallest district in New Taipei City. It is primarily a mixed residential and commercial area. With around 38,000 inhabitants per square kilometer as of 2019, Yonghe is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world.

==History==
On 1 January 1979, Yonghe was upgraded from an urban township to a county-administered city of Taipei County. With the changing of Taipei County to the special municipality of New Taipei City on 25 December 2010, Yonghe City was changed to Yonghe District.

==Geology==
The Xindian River forms a natural boundary between Yonghe and Taipei City to the north and east, although three bridges connect the two areas. To the south and west lies Zhonghe District, which shares some administration and facilities with Yonghe.

==Notable products==
The city is famous for its soy milk, and breakfast stores advertising &quot;Yonghe Soy Milk&quot; can be found all over Taiwan.

==Administrative divisions==
The district comprises 62 villages: 
Anhe (), Bao&#x27;an (), Baoping (), Baoshun (), Datong (), Daxin (), Dehe (), Dianjie (), Dingxi (), Fuhe (), Fulin (), Fuxing (), Guangfu (), Guangming (), Guilin (), Hebin (), Heping (), Heti (), Houxi (), Lixing (), Minben (), Minfu (), Minle (), Minquan (), Minsheng (), Minzhi (), Minzu (), Qianxi (), Ren&#x27;ai (), Shanglin (), Shangxi (), Shuanghe (), Shuiyuan (), Tan&#x27;an (), Tanqian (), Wangxi (), Wenhua (), Xiaxi (), Xiehe (), Xinbu (), Xinsheng (), Xinyi (), Xiucheng (), Xiude (), Xiuhe (), Xiulang (), Xiulin (), Xiuyuan (), Yong&#x27;an (), Yongcheng (), Yongfu (), Yongle (), Yongxing (), Yongyuan (), Yongzhen (), Yüxi (), Zhengxing (), Zhiguang (), Zhongxi (), Zhongxing (), Zhongyi (), Zhulin ().

<doc id="950971" wikidata="Q3417792" url="?curid=950971" title="Mohr–Coulomb theory">
<text>Mohr–Coulomb theory is a mathematical model (see yield surface) describing the response of brittle materials such as concrete, or rubble piles, to shear stress as well as normal stress. Most of the classical engineering materials follow this rule in at least a portion of their shear failure envelope. Generally the theory applies to materials for which the compressive strength far exceeds the tensile strength.

In geotechnical engineering it is used to define shear strength of soils and rocks at different effective stresses.

In structural engineering it is used to determine failure load as well as the angle of fracture of a displacement fracture in concrete and similar materials. Coulomb&#x27;s friction hypothesis is used to determine the combination of shear and normal stress that will cause a fracture of the material. Mohr&#x27;s circle is used to determine which principal stresses will produce this combination of shear and normal stress, and the angle of the plane in which this will occur. According to the principle of normality the stress introduced at failure will be perpendicular to the line describing the fracture condition.

It can be shown that a material failing according to Coulomb&#x27;s friction hypothesis will show the displacement introduced at failure forming an angle to the line of fracture equal to the angle of friction. This makes the strength of the material determinable by comparing the external mechanical work introduced by the displacement and the external load with the internal mechanical work introduced by the strain and stress at the line of failure. By conservation of energy the sum of these must be zero and this will make it possible to calculate the failure load of the construction.

A common improvement of this model is to combine Coulomb&#x27;s friction hypothesis with Rankine&#x27;s principal stress hypothesis to describe a separation fracture. An alternative view derives the Mohr-Coulomb criterion as extension failure.

== History of the development ==
The Mohr–Coulomb theory is named in honour of Charles-Augustin de Coulomb and Christian Otto Mohr. Coulomb&#x27;s contribution was a 1776 essay entitled &quot;Essai sur une application des règles des maximis et minimis à quelques problèmes de statique relatifs à l&#x27;architecture&quot;
Mohr developed a generalised form of the theory around the end of the 19th century.
As the generalised form affected the interpretation of the criterion, but not the substance of it, some texts continue to refer to the criterion as simply the &#x27;Coulomb criterion&#x27;.

== Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion ==

The Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion represents the linear envelope that is obtained from a plot of the shear strength of a material versus the applied normal stress. This relation is expressed as
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the shear strength, formula_3 is the normal stress, formula_4 is the intercept of the failure envelope with the formula_2 axis, and formula_6 is the slope of the failure envelope. The quantity formula_4 is often called the cohesion and the angle formula_8 is called the angle of internal friction. Compression is assumed to be positive in the following discussion. If compression is assumed to be negative then formula_3 should be replaced with formula_10.

If formula_11, the Mohr–Coulomb criterion reduces to the Tresca criterion. On the other hand, if formula_12 the Mohr–Coulomb model is equivalent to the Rankine model. Higher values of formula_8 are not allowed.

From Mohr&#x27;s circle we have
formula_14
where
formula_15
and formula_16 is the maximum principal stress and formula_17 is the minimum principal stress.

Therefore, the Mohr–Coulomb criterion may also be expressed as
formula_18

This form of the Mohr–Coulomb criterion is applicable to failure on a plane that is parallel to the formula_19 direction.

=== Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion in three dimensions ===
The Mohr–Coulomb criterion in three dimensions is often expressed as
:formula_20
The Mohr–Coulomb failure surface is a cone with a hexagonal cross section in deviatoric stress space.

The expressions for formula_2 and formula_3 can be generalized to three dimensions by developing expressions for the normal stress and the resolved shear stress on a plane of arbitrary orientation with respect to the coordinate axes (basis vectors). If the unit normal to the plane of interest is
:formula_23
where formula_24 are three orthonormal unit basis vectors, and if the principal stresses formula_25 are aligned with the basis vectors formula_26, then the expressions for formula_27 are
:formula_28
The Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion can then be evaluated using the usual expression
formula_29
for the six planes of maximum shear stress.

<text>The Faliscan language is the extinct Italic language of the ancient Falisci, who lived in southern Etruria at Tiber Valley. Together with Latin, it formed the Latino-Faliscan languages group of the Italic languages. It seems probable that the language persisted, being gradually permeated with Latin, until at least 150 BC.

==Corpus==
An estimated 355 inscriptions survive, mostly short and dating from the 7th to the 2nd centuries BC. Some are written from right to left in a variety of the Old Italic alphabet, derived from the Etruscan alphabet, but they show some traces of the influence of the Latin alphabet. An inscription to Ceres of c. 600 BC, found in Falerii, usually taken to be the oldest example, is written left to right.

A specimen of the language appears written around the edge of a picture on a patera, the genuineness of which is established by the fact that the words were written before the glaze was put on: &#x27;, . That sample indicates that Faliscan was less conservative in some respects than Latin, with the wearing down of final case endings and the obscuring of the etymology of &#x27; &quot;today&quot;, which is more obvious in Latin &#x27; (from &#x27;).The inscription (&quot;foied uino pafo cra carefo&quot;), Italian: &quot;oggi berrò il vino, domani farò senza&quot;, was made over a kylix red figure vase found in Penna&#x27;s Necropolis of Falerii Veteres at Tiber Valley, it is now conserved at the Etruscan National Museum of Villa Giulia in Rome.

There are remains found in graves, which belong mainly to the period of Etruscan domination and give ample evidence of material prosperity and refinement. Earlier strata have yielded more primitive remains from the Italic epoch. Many inscriptions with mainly proper names may be regarded as Etruscan rather than Faliscan; they have been disregarded in the account of the dialect just given.

The town of Feronia, in Sardinia, was named probably after their native goddess by Faliscan settlers. A votive inscription from some of them is found at S. Maria di Falleri.

==Phonology==
Here are some of the phonetic characteristics of the Faliscan language:

#The retention of medial &quot;f&quot;, which Latin changed to &quot;b&quot; ( /fefaked/ in the Praeneste fibula may be Proto-Latino-Faliscan);
#The palatalization of &quot;d&quot; followed by consonantal &quot;i&quot; into some sound, denoted merely by &quot;i-&quot;, the central sound of &quot;&quot;, from &quot;fo-died&quot;;
#The loss of final &quot;s&quot;, at least before certain following sounds (&#x27; = Latin &#x27;);
#The retention with Latin of the labiovelars (&#x27; = Latin &#x27;, compare Umbrian &quot;pan&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)&quot;u&quot;);
#The assimilation of some final consonants to the initial sound of the next word: &#x27; (Conway, &quot;lib. cit.&quot; 321) = Latin &#x27; (&#x27; for &#x27;, an archaic genitive).

=== Problem of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;h&quot; ===
The question of irregular, unexpected developments of the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirates in Faliscan, as opposed to the normal Latin rendering, is the appearance of both &quot;h&quot; and &quot;f&quot; as reflexes of *bh/*dh and *gh: &quot;filea&quot; &#x27;daughter&#x27; and &quot;hileo&quot; &#x27;son&#x27; = Latin &quot;filius&quot; &lt; Proto-Indo-European *dheh₁-lyo- and &quot;fe&quot; &#x27;here&#x27; and &quot;hec&quot; = Latin &quot;hic&quot; &lt; Proto-Indo-European *ghey-ke.

In 1991, Rex E. Wallace and B. D. Joseph offered an explanation. They suggested that while it is documented also in Latin, it is the Faliscan material that provides a clearer picture of the supposed developments.

They remark that the unexpected outcomes are absent from the archaic Faliscan inscriptions and that the regular outcomes largely outnumber the irregular ones in the Faliscan epigraphic corpus. The unexpected outcomes show up only in middle and late Faliscan. The following are the only instances:

:&quot;h&quot; for expected &quot;f&quot;:
::&quot;hileo&quot; (son) Middle Faliscan
::&quot;hirmia&quot; (gentilicium) Middle Faliscan (&quot;firmio&quot; is also attested)
::&quot;hirmio&quot; (gentilicium) Late Faliscan
::&quot;holcosio&quot; (gentilicium) Late Faliscan
::&quot;haba&quot; &#x27;a kind of bean&#x27; &lt; *bhabo- (cited by grammarian Quintus Terentius Scaurus as Faliscan)
:&quot;f&quot; for expected &quot;h&quot;:
::&quot;foied&quot; &#x27;today&#x27; Middle Faliscan &lt; *gho:d d(i)ed
::&quot;fe&quot; &#x27;here&#x27; Late Faliscan &lt; *ghey-ke

Wallace and Joseph suppose that the first change is a natural sound change that can be seen in many languages (Spanish &quot;hijo&quot; &#x27;son&#x27; from Latin &quot;filium&quot; &#x27;son&#x27; [accusative]), which in Faliscan affected only a few possible candidate words. The second outcome cannot be explained as a sound change and so they argue it is a hypercorrect form caused by the other development. While the change from &quot;f&quot; to &quot;h&quot; was taking place and awareness of the correct forms was being lost, some speakers started restoring &quot;f&quot; even when it was not etymologically appropriate.

== Alphabet ==

Faliscan inscriptions were typically recorded in a unique Faliscan alphabet. This alphabet appears in the earliest Faliscan inscriptions; it dates back to the 7th century BCE. It possibly derives from Western Greek alphabets. However, it may also derive from the Etruscan alphabet, which potentially served as an intermediary between the Faliscan and Greek alphabets. Regardless, the ultimate source of the Faliscan alphabet is definitively Greek. During the transition from Greek to Faliscan, the Greek letter “γ” was transformed into “𐌂.” In some examples of graffiti, the letter is instead spelled like &quot;𐌭.&quot; The Greek letter “κ” was transformed into “𐌊” and “ϙ” was adapted as “𐌒.” However, these three letters all represented the same phoneme. Over time, this redundancy caused the Faliscan, Etruscan, and Latin alphabets to alter the role of these letters within their alphabets. Faliscan dropped the letter “𐌒” and repurposed “𐌊” to represent the /g/ phoneme instead. One Early Faliscan inscription contains the word “eqo,” however “q” likely represents the /g/ phoneme. One, likely Faliscan, inscription engraved on a bronze contains the Latin letter “g.” It contains words such as “&quot;gonlegium&quot;” and “&quot;gondecorant&quot;.” These unusual spellings likely stem from a Faliscan writer who was uncertain about the proper usage of the letter “g.”

The Greek letters “β,” “Θ,” and “δ” were not adapted into Faliscan. It is possible that “β” was never incorporated into Faliscan because the /b/ phoneme was rare in the language and the difference between /b/ and /p/ was morphologically irrelevant. However, there are several rare examples of Faliscan inscriptions containing the letter “𐌁.” One Faliscan inscription contains the text “&quot;Tito batio&quot;.” This discrepancy likely occurred due to Latin influence. The word “batio” may be a synonym for the Latin word “Battius”, which is found in Roman inscriptions. Unlike other Italic languages, Faliscan never adopted “𐌅”. Instead, it had its own unique sign, “𐋇,” for /f/. Theta, a Greek letter written as “Θ”, was also never formally incorporated into the Faliscan alphabet. However, it appears in a small number of Faliscan inscriptions. When used by the Faliscans, it was typically written like “.” The Faliscans likely opted for this method of writing the letter to avoid confusion with “𐌏.” This letter possibly represented the allophone /t/ in the few Faliscan inscriptions it appears in. The letter &quot;𐌑,&quot; which was also common in Etruscan writing, was rare in Faliscan writing. It appears in two Faliscan inscriptions from Corchiano. Instead of the standard Etruscan &quot;𐌑,&quot; &quot;𐌌&quot; was used in Early Faliscan writings. In Middle and Late Faliscan writings, &quot;&quot; was used instead.

Faliscan inscriptions from all time periods utilize “𐌄” as the standard symbol for the /e/ phoneme. Sometimes, “,” a less common alternative that lacked the line protrusion at the bottom of the letter was used instead. There are rare instances of the variant “” replacing the standard letter. Although this variant may be a writing error, it occurs multiple times in separate Faliscan inscriptions, indicating that it may be a legitimate alternative to the more common version. Various cursive forms of the letter are known. “II” is the most common cursive form in Faliscan inscriptions and is also the cursive form used in Latin. One bronze strigil found near the necropolis by San Antonio one inscription contains the cursive variant “.” The inscription is possibly Middle Faliscan, however it is written in the Etruscan alphabet, and may be Etruscan. This is similar to an Etruscan letter “,” which was also found in a necropolis near San Antonio. One rare form of the Faliscan “𐌄” is &quot;.&quot; This form appears in two inscriptions. Another example of this letter was found in a Latin inscription painted on the backs of three tiles in Ardea. These more unique cursive forms may also be cursive variants of “𐌇.” The symbol &quot;𐌇&quot; was also used in Middle and Late Faliscan inscriptions to represent the /h/ phoneme, In some inscriptions, “&quot; is used instead. This shape may be a simplification of &quot;𐌇,&quot; or possibly a new symbol inspired by the Latin &quot;H.&quot; Another variant of &quot;𐌇&quot; is &quot;.&quot; This form is a possibly cursive version of the letter and appears in only one inscription.

The transition from Early Faliscan to Middle Faliscan was accompanied by numerous changes to the Faliscan alphabet. Early Faliscan “A” or “𐌀” was changed into “,” a variant with an extended line and a slightly convex upper part. This variant was often confused with the letter “ᚱ.” During this time period, various cursive forms of “𐌀&quot; emerged, such as &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot;,&quot; &quot;𐌡,&quot; or &quot;.” Another letter, &quot;,&quot; is found in two Faliscan inscriptions. This may be a cursive form of the Latin letter &quot;a.&quot; In the Early Faliscan alphabet, &quot;𐌍&quot; was used to represent the /n/ phoneme. However, by Middle and Late Faliscan, the variant &quot;&quot; was utilized. During the transition to Middle Faliscan, the letter “𐤨” was transformed into the larger variant &quot;𐌊.” “𐌔,” “,” and “” are the standard forms of the letter “s” in Middle and Late Faliscan. It is extremely common for inscriptions to reverse the direction of their letters. In some inscriptions “” is used instead. This likely occurs due to a writing error. Greek “ζ” appears in a small number of Faliscan inscriptions. It is unclear if this letter represented a separate phoneme from “𐌔” or if it was exclusively an orthographic difference. It is possible that in some of the inscriptions containing “ζ” the letter represents the “/z/“ phoneme. However, the usage of this letter may result from Etruscan influence.

Throughout all of Faliscan history, “,” “,” and “𐊄” were used to represent the /t/ phoneme. The basic sign for /l/ was &quot;𐌋,&quot; although sometimes a variant with a flattened bottom was used. The letter “𐌐” was typically used for the &quot;/p/&quot; phoneme. It has rare alternatives such as &quot;Ρ&quot; or &quot;.&quot; The Faliscan letter “𐌏” which represented the “/o/“ phoneme, sometimes has a cursive variant with two open slits at the top and bottom.

== Declension ==

=== First declension ===
Like Latin, words of the Faliscan first declension nominative singular primarily ended in -&quot;a&quot;. Faliscan and Latin both transitioned their nominative plural forms from the Proto-Italic -&quot;ās&quot; to -&quot;aῐ&quot;. The first declension accusative singular form is exclusively attested in Early Faliscan inscriptions. Early Faliscan probably retained the lengthened version -&quot;ām&quot;, which comes directly from Proto-Italic. Later forms of the Faliscan language likely lost the vowel length, the ending instead becoming -&quot;am&quot;. Early and Middle Faliscan terms in the first declension genitive singular often end in -&quot;as&quot;, the same genitive singular form used in Old Latin. However, like Latin, it is possible that this form shifted to &quot;-ai&quot; with the progression of time, appearing in Middle and Late Faliscan inscriptions. The -&quot;ai&quot; form is also found used as a dative singular; it appears in sepulchral inscriptions such as &quot;&quot;larise: mar||cna: citiai&quot;,&quot; which often read &quot;[X] made this grave for [Y].&quot; Late Faliscan inscriptions show the -&quot;a&quot; form as dative, although this likely derives from Latin influence. It is also possible that instead of representing a separate ending, it is merely a unique spelling of the &quot;ae&quot; sound. First declension ablative singular may have been -&quot;ad&quot; or -&quot;a&quot;, deriving from the Proto-Italic form /-&quot;ād&quot;/ either way. One singular Early Faliscan inscription suggests that the form -&quot;ad&quot; may have existed in the language; this form also appears in a Late Faliscan inscription, but possibly as an archaism not necessarily representative of contemporary linguistic developments. Another possible form, -&quot;a&quot;, also the ablative singular first declension form in Latin, appears in the word &quot;ifra&quot; from a Middle Faliscan inscription.
=== Second declension ===
Early Faliscan inscriptions utilize the form -&quot;os&quot; as the second declension nominative singular, although this form is largely replaced by -&quot;o&quot; in later variations of the Faliscan language. Faliscan largely preserved the Proto-Italic form /-&quot;os&quot;/ while it was syncopated into -&quot;io&quot; in the Osco-Umbrian languages. However, there is at least one—possibly three—examples of the ending -&quot;io&quot; appearing in inscriptions from Capena, likely due to influence from neighboring Osco-Umbrian languages. The form -&quot;e&quot;, likely representing the vowel -&quot;ē&quot;, was used to represent the Faliscan second declension nominative plural. It is exclusively attested for in the word &quot;lete&quot;, found in a Middle Faliscan inscription. This ending—-&quot;e—&quot;also appears as a vocative singular ending in the word &quot;uoltene&quot; from an Early Faliscan inscription. In the Faliscan second declension, the dative singular form was -&quot;oi&quot; and the ablative singular was &quot;-od&quot;. The ablative form has only been identified in Early Faliscan inscriptions, although it potentially transitioned to -&quot;o&quot; as Faliscan developed. Accusative singular and genitive plural second declension forms are attested with the ending -&quot;om&quot;, a remnant of the Proto-Italic form /-om/. Early Faliscan inscriptions often contain the second declension genitive singular ending -&quot;osio&quot;, although Middle and Late Faliscan inscriptions utilize the genitive singular form -&quot;i&quot;. In one Middle Faliscan inscription containing the word &quot;cicoi&quot;, the ending &quot;-oi&quot; likely functioned as a genitive singular form. Other Faliscan writings have been theorized to contain the genitive singular endings -&quot;io&quot; and -&quot;oio&quot;; the Faliscan scholar Dr. Gabriël Bakkum considered these theories to be unsupported by existing evidence, arguing these interpretations are misreading of the text.
=== Third declension ===
The little evidence for the Faliscan third declension nominative singular indicates that, like Latin, Faliscan third declension words may have been marked by the stems /-ō/, /-ns/, /-ks/, or /-nts/. This declension possibly contained the accusative singular form -&quot;em&quot; for consonant-stem terms, although this is only attested in terms such as which have been interpreted as either nominatives or accusatives used as nominatives. Another neuter accusative singular form is found in the word &quot;far&quot; from an Early Faliscan inscription, likely derived from Proto-Italic */-fars/. Genitive singular forms for the third declension are also attested in the existing Faliscan corpus; the third declension consonant-stem genitive singular ending -&quot;os&quot; was considered by Italian scholar Gabriella Giacomelli to be one of the primary morphological distinctions between the Faliscan and Latin languages. However, this analysis is contradicted by Dr. Gabriël Bakkum, who notes that Old Latin and Faliscan both shared the genitive singular form -&quot;os&quot;. The archaeological record suggests that the Faliscan third declension may have contained the stem -&quot;i&quot; in the nominative singular form. These -&quot;i&quot; stem words may have used the ending -&quot;es&quot; as their nominative plural and the genitive singular form -&quot;e&quot;, likely representative of either the /-is/, /-es/, /-eʰ/, /-eˀ/, /-ẹʰ/, or /-ẹˀ/ phonemes. The -&quot;i&quot; stem genitive plural is attested in the word &quot;[fel]ịcinatu&quot; from a Late Faliscan inscription. This form resembles the Proto-Indo-European ending /-i-om/ and the Old Latin form -&quot;iom&quot;.
=== Fourth and Fifth Declensions ===
The Faliscan fourth declension accusative singular is exclusively attested for in a Late Faliscan inscription containing the phrase &quot;macistratu&quot; &quot;keset&quot;, a direct equivalent of the Latin phrase &quot;magistratum keset&quot;. Although this direct translation makes certain the reading of &quot;macistratu&quot; as an accusative singular, it also implies that the text may have adopted Latin characteristics and is therefore not fully reflective of Faliscan. The genitive singular form of the fourth declension may have been -&quot;uos&quot;, deriving from the Proto-Italic genitive ending */-oŭs/. This form is evidenced by a Late Faliscan inscription reading &quot;de | zenatuo · sententiad&quot;. However, this text may not have been Faliscan, it can be read as a Latin instead. If the text was Faliscan, it may not have reflected the standard rendition of the language; -&quot;uos&quot; was possibly an uncommon ending compared to a hypothetical &quot;-ōs.&quot; The word &quot;mercui&quot; has been identified as possessing a dative singular ending of the Faliscan fourth declension;&#x27; the form -&quot;ui&quot; likely represented either the /-uǐ/ or /-ūǐ/ phonemes. Very little of the Faliscan fifth declension has been identified in the existing Faliscan corpus. The word &quot;dies&quot;, restored from an incomplete Middle Faliscan inscription, may contain the nominative singular ending of the fifth declension.&#x27; The fifth declension ablative singular ending may have been -&quot;ed&quot;; it is possibly attested in a Middle Faliscan inscription containing the adverb &quot;foied&quot;.&quot;&quot;
== Verb ==
Like the Latin and Sabellic languages, the Faliscan language obeys a four-conjugation system. The first conjugation is attested in Faliscan verbs such as &quot;cupat&quot;, a cognate of the Latin &quot;cubat&quot;. Athematic laryngeal verbs, such as the words &quot;porded&quot; and &quot;pipafo&quot;, were possibly also included within the first conjugation. The second conjugation includes the verb &quot;salueto&quot;, the third conjugation is attested in words such as &quot;fifiked&quot;, and the fourth conjugation is largely unattested. The word &quot;douiad&quot; may have been a fourth conjugation word, although it is more likely to be a mixed conjugation word. 

Faliscan verbs were conjugated according to tense, although only the present, perfect, and future tenses are attested for in the surviving Faliscan corpus. The Faliscan future tense was seemingly differentiated from the other tenses through the suffix /-f/, it appears in the second conjugation word &quot;carefo.&quot; The Faliscan perfect was distinguished through the perfect stems, unique stems marking the verb as perfect from which the word can be conjugated. In Faliscan, perfect stems can be generated through reduplication, such as in the verbs &quot;fifiked and pe⁝parai&quot;. Perfect forms may have also been distinguished through a sigmatic aorist. Sigmatic forms possibly appear in the verb &quot;keset&quot;, a synonym of Latin &quot;gessit&quot;.&#x27; Other words, such as &quot;faced&quot;, may have been perfect forms that lost their reduplicative syllable or descended from old aorists.&#x27; 

Different moods within the Faliscan language are attested; the imperative ending /-te/ is evidenced through the word &quot;saluete—&quot;identified in an Early Faliscan inscription—and possibly the word &quot;urate&quot;, from an Early Faliscan or Etruscan text.&#x27; Early Faliscan writings contain evidence of the future imperative endings /-tōd/ in the word &quot;saluetod&quot;.&#x27; The words &quot;pramed&quot; and &quot;douiad&quot;—found in Early Faliscan texts—may be first conjugation subjunctives. These forms indicate that Faliscan had an ē-subjunctive and an ā-subjunctive respectively. The verb &quot;to be&quot; contained subjunctive forms such as &quot;seite&quot;, likely derived from the Proto-Indo-European optative mood.&quot;

=== Perfect stems ===
== Sample text ==

The following Faliscan text was engraved on a bronze tablet fastened with rivets. It is the youngest known inscription in the Faliscan alphabet; it is not significantly older than 150 BCE. It was a public dedication and utilizes the same language used by local officials. The left half was found in 1860 and the right half was found in 1870, the same year the full text was assembled and published:
Although it contains an almost entirely Faliscan orthography, it still several distinctly non-Faliscan features. Such as the &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;uootum&quot;.&quot;

Another Faliscan inscription was identified on an impasto pitcher dating back to the 7th century BCE. The original text contained no word separation. It reads:

If it were written with word separation the text would read:

Translated, it means:

The following Faliscan inscription dates back to the 7th or 6th century BCE and was identified on shards from a vase found in a tomb:

<text>The Olympic mascots are fictional characters who represent the cultural heritage of the location where the Olympic Games are taking place. They are often an animal native to the area or human figures. 

One of the first Olympic mascots was created for the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble; a stylized cartoon character on skis named Schuss. The first official Olympic mascot appeared in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, and was a rainbow-colored Dachshund dog named Waldi.

Since the Games in Vancouver in 2010, the Olympic and Paralympic mascots have always been presented together, which was first done in Barcelona in 1992. The Youth Olympic Games, which are run by the International Olympic Committee, have had mascots as well.

<text>ITHF table hockey is a sport played on table hockey games. International Table Hockey Federation (ITHF) is an organization that oversees these competitions. The origin of the sport was the Swedish Championship 1982 in Upplands Väsby. Organized table hockey is played in northern, central and eastern Europe, in North America, but table hockey is also played in South America, Africa, Australia, and Asia.

The World Championship is organized by the ITHF every two years. The models, produced by Stiga, are the official game for competitions.

Sweden has dominated the table hockey scene from the beginning and a couple of years into the new millennium. Until the Finnish gold in Riga 2005, Sweden had won all Team World Championships, until 2006 only Swedes had won the Open Swedish Masters, and until 2007 all individual world champions were Swedes. But the new generation of players comes from Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Latvia, Canada, Denmark, the United States, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Norway, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia and Lithuania, and its current world champion, as of 2023 is Evgeniy Matantsev from Ukraine. From December 2013 until 2021, Maxim Borisov from Russia had been ranked #1 in the world. In the 2023 World Team Championships Latvia was the winner.

Since the sport expands quickly in many countries, the table hockey map may have to be redrawn within a couple of years when nations other than the big eight (Sweden, Finland, Russia, Czech Republic, Norway, Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine) produce new talents.

==History==

First table hockey games were made during the 1930s in Sweden and Canada. Naturally there was no plastic, so they were made from sheet metal.

The use of plastic brought an expansion of table hockey. The Swedish company Stiga started to make hockey tables in the late 1950s. Thanks to the enthusiasm of Swedish players, table hockey expanded to the rest of the world.

Big worldwide development arrived in the late 1990s. That led to an idea founding an international federation. ITHF was established during the World Championship 2005 in Riga, Latvia. Now it associates 21 national federation.

Especially in Sweden, Finland, Russia, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Latvia, table hockey is quite popular. But it is growing in lots of countries and there are many tournaments played every week.

==Game rules==


These are the most important rules. Whole rules.

===Game model and preparation===

*Stiga games must be used.
*Goal cups must be removed.
*Games must be fastened to the table.
*The speed of the game&#x27;s surface must be kept the same as the usual factory surface speed.

===Playing figures===

*Figures from the Stiga Play-off versions (all figures have the stick on the same side) of Stiga table hockey games must be used.

===Matches===

*Matches last five minutes.
*Time runs even if the puck is out of play.
*An audio timer should be used for all matches.
*If any player retires during a match when the opponent insists on continuing, he/she automatically loses all his/her goals scored during the game, while the opponent may add an extra five goals to his/her score.
*During the play-off matches, in the event of a draw at the end of the five minutes, there is an overtime. The overtime starts with a new face-off. The winner is the one who scores the first goal (sudden death).

===Face-offs===

*All matches begin with the puck placed at centre spot. Game starts with the opening signal. If any player plays the puck before the signal, face-off is made.
*Face-offs are made by dropping the puck on the centre spot.

Centre forwards and left defenders must stay on their own side of the centre red line during a face-off.

*Players must be sure that their opponent is ready before releasing the puck. If the face-off is made wrong the opponent is allowed to ask for a new one or he/she may make a new face-off by himself/herself. If a player makes a lot of bad drops in a play-off match, the opponent can ask for a neutral dropper.
*Three seconds must elapse after each face-off before a valid goal can be scored. This rule is in effect even if a neutral person is making the face-off.
*The puck must hit the sideboards, or a playing figure other than the center must gain control of the puck before a goal can be counted.

===Scoring===

*The puck must stay in the goal cage for the goal to count. In and outs do not count. If the puck goes out from the goal cage, the match continues without interruption
*If any player wants to interrupt the game in order to avoid the goal heading into his cage, he must clearly say a short phrase. The game is interrupted and puck placed in the middle of the board for the next face off. The phrase could only be said if the player keeps the puck long enough to enable his opponent to say it.
*The puck must be removed from the puck catcher (if there is any) before the next face off.
*A goal scored directly by pressing a motionless puck against the goal cage or against the goalie does not count. A goal scored in this way indirectly (off the bank or off another figure) counts.
*If a goal is scored when the final buzzer is sounding, the goal is not valid.
*If any figure or goalie breaks when a goal is scored, the goal is valid.
*A goal scored by moving the whole game is not valid.

===Goal crease rule===

*If the puck is in full rest in goal crease and is touching the goal line the defending player may call &quot;block&quot; and a new face-off is made.
*If the puck is in full rest in goal crease and is not touching the goal line the defending player must play the puck.

===Possession rule===

*It is not permitted to retain possession of the puck without making any recognizable attempt to score a goal. This is regarded as passive play.
*If the puck is kept in possession by one figure without passing or shooting, a warning can be given by the opponent after five (5) seconds has elapsed since the figure gained puck control.

===Interference===

*A player can tap down his/her figures only when he/she has complete possession of the puck.
*If a player scores a goal while the opponent is tapping his/her figures, the goal counts.
*Rough playing that results in shaking of the game and causing the puck to move is forbidden.
*If any figure loses possession of the puck due to shaking of the game, then the puck must be returned to this figure.

===Interruption===

*If any unusual situation happens (e.g. broken gear, rod or game, displaced goal cage, lights go out, several pucks appear on the game or somebody/something interrupts any of the opponents), the match must be immediately suspended. A player can interrupt the game by saying &quot;stop&quot; if the opponent is not aware of such situation. The match resumes when both players are ready again.
*If a match is interrupted and significant time is lost then the lost time must be added to remaining time and the match continues.
*If a player had indisputable control of the puck before the interruption, the match continues with the puck in the place where it was, otherwise a new face-off is made.

==World Table Hockey Tour==
In 2003/04, the first worldwide league, EuroLeague (EL), was created. 6 tournaments formed the league, The tournaments were Helsinki Open, Oslo Open, Riga Cup, Swedish Masters, Moscow Open and Czech Open.

The league has changed name to World Table Hockey Tour (WT), and consists every year of around 15 tournaments. The original 6 tournaments (B6) were still regarded as the most important tournaments, and were called the Big Six tournaments. These tournaments were later renamed to SuperSeries, and in the 2021/2022 season there were 6 SuperSeries tournaments (in Slovenia, Latvia, Sweden, Estonia, Czech Republic and Russia).

==ITHF World ranking==

The World ranking table sorts players by their actual rank points. The ranking is sum of player&#x27;s best results in last two years. Points, which player gets for 
participating in any reported tournament are counted on the basis of: level of the tournament, number of players beaten and world ranking of players beaten. A winner of the World Championship always gets 1010 points and a winner of Europe Championship or North America Championship gets at least 610 points.
World ranking with a reduced coefficient calculated points to six years. There are more than 8 000 players from more than 50 countries and five continents in the world ranking, organized through over 400 clubs.

===ITHF ranking - National===
The rank points of a nation is the sum of its five best players. The table below shows the top 10 nations and the top 10 individuals in every class as of February 11, 2025. Complete table

===ITHF ranking - Open===

<doc id="950984" wikidata="Q6502584" url="?curid=950984" title="Lavern Ahlstrom">
<text>Lavern Ahlstrom (May 28, 1936 – April 12, 2024) was a Canadian provincial level politician who was leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party.

==Political career==
Ahlstrom first became involved with Social Credit in the 1970s. He has been a perennial candidate for the party with some moderately successful showings during his career. Ahlstrom first ran for office in electoral district of Rocky Mountain House in the 1979 Alberta general election finishing second to Progressive Conservative Jack Campbell.

He ran for a second time in the 1986 Alberta general election, this time for the Representative Party of Alberta finishing third. In that election he was once again defeated by Campbell. He would run again in the 1993 Alberta general election once again for Social Credit finishing a strong second to Progressive Conservative Ty Lund.

In the 1997 Alberta general election he would go against Lund for a second time coming up with his best electoral result ever, finishing a close second again. He would attempt another run against Lund in the 2001 Alberta general election this time being defeated finishing second in a landslide. He would run for the last time in the 2004 Alberta general election this time as party leader finishing in a second place tie.

==Leader of Social Credit==
Ahlstrom was elected leader of Social Credit after James Alberts departed in 2001 after a poor showing in the 2001 Alberta general election. Ahlstrom&#x27;s leadership of the Alberta Social Credit Party has been notable for the party re-embracing elements of Social Credit economic and monetary theory. Electoral wise he led the party to a better showing running 43 candidates in the 2004 Alberta general election earning 1.2% of the popular vote. The last election contested under his leadership was the Drumheller-Stettler by election held in June 2007. Social Credit finished a very strong third vastly improving their showing in the district over 2004.

Ahlstrom resigned as leader and was replaced by Len Skowronski in November 2007. He died on April 12, 2024, at the age of 87.

<doc id="950991" wikidata="Q228027" url="?curid=950991" title="Little finger">
<text>The little finger or pinkie, also known as the baby finger, fifth digit, or pinky finger, is the most ulnar and smallest digit of the human hand, and next to the ring finger.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pinkie&quot; is derived from the Dutch word , meaning &quot;little finger&quot;.

The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;pinkie&quot; is from Scotland in 1808. The term (sometimes spelled &quot;pinky&quot;) is common in Scottish English and American English, and is also used extensively in other Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand, Canada, and Australia.

==Nerves and muscles==
There are nine muscles that control the fifth digit:
Three in the hypothenar eminence, two extrinsic flexors, two extrinsic extensors, and two more intrinsic muscles:
* Hypothenar eminence:
** Opponens digiti minimi muscle
** Abductor minimi digiti muscle (adduction from third palmar interossei)
** Flexor digiti minimi brevis (the &quot;longus&quot; is absent in most humans)
* Two extrinsic flexors:
** Flexor digitorum superficialis
** Flexor digitorum profundus
* Two extrinsic extensors:
** Extensor digiti minimi muscle
** Extensor digitorum
* Two intrinsic hand muscles:
** Fourth lumbrical muscle
** Third palmar interosseous muscle
&quot;Note: the dorsal interossei of the hand muscles do not have an attachment to the fifth digit&quot;

==Cultural significance==
===Gestures===

Among American children, a &quot;pinky swear&quot; or &quot;pinky promise&quot; is made when a person wraps one of their pinky fingers around another person&#x27;s pinky and makes a promise. Something similar is also seen in China and Korea, where people link their pinky fingers and then stamp their thumbs together to make a &quot;yaksok&quot; (promise).

Other gestures where the little finger is extended include the shaka sign and sign of the horns.

Among members of the Japanese &quot;yakuza&quot; (gangsters), the penalty for various offenses is removal of parts of the little finger (known as &quot;yubitsume&quot;).

It is a common joke that one should extend their little finger when drinking from a teacup in imitation of a passé upper-class tradition. This practice is generally deprecated by etiquette guides as a sign of snobbery amongst the socially inferior, with various cultural theories as to the origin of the practice including the idea that finger food should be eaten with only the first three digits.

The messaging application Teams from Microsoft has an emoji which is a representation of a closed hand with the little finger raised. The description is &quot;Nature&#x27;s call&quot; which is a polite euphemism used when someone feels a need to urinate or defecate.

===Rings===
The signet ring is traditionally worn on the little finger of a gentleman&#x27;s left hand, a practice still common especially in the United Kingdom, Australia, and European cultures. A signet ring is considered part of the regalia of many European monarchies, and also of the Pope, with the ring always worn on the left little finger. In modern times the location of the signet ring has relaxed, with examples worn on various different digits, although little fingers still tend to be the most usual.

The Iron Ring is a symbolic ring worn by most Canadian engineers. The Ring is a symbol of both pride and humility for the engineering profession, and is always worn on the little finger of the dominant hand. In the United States, the Engineer&#x27;s Ring is a stainless steel ring worn on the fifth digit of the working hand by engineers who belong to the Order of the Engineer and have accepted the Obligation of an Engineer.

===Utility===
The little finger is often used as a support when smartphone users type one-handed. The little finger is positioned underneath the phone, allowing it to be propped with the three middle fingers, and the user to type with their thumb.

Some users reported dents on their little finger and pain in the hand after prolonged use in this way, doctors referred to this as &quot;iPhone pinky&quot; or &quot;smartphone pinky&quot;. The skin indentations were reported to be nothing of alarm, as they disappeared on their own after a short while without cell phone use.

<doc id="950992" wikidata="Q252451" url="?curid=950992" title="Elevator (aeronautics)">
<text>Elevators are flight control surfaces, usually at the rear of an aircraft, which control the aircraft&#x27;s pitch, and therefore the angle of attack and the lift of the wing. The elevators are usually hinged to the tailplane or horizontal stabilizer. They may be the only pitch control surface present, and are sometimes located at the front of the aircraft (early airplanes and canards) or integrated into a rear &quot;all-moving tailplane&quot;, also called a slab elevator or stabilator.

==Elevator control effectiveness==
The elevator is a usable up and down system that controls the plane, horizontal stabilizer usually creates a &quot;downward&quot; force which balances the nose down moment created by the wing lift force, which typically applies at a point (the wing center of lift) situated aft of the airplane&#x27;s center of gravity. The effects of drag and changing the engine thrust may also result in pitch moments that need to be compensated with the horizontal stabilizer.

Both the horizontal stabilizer and the elevator contribute to pitch stability, but only the elevators provide pitch control. They do so by decreasing or increasing the downward force created by the stabilizer:
* an increased downward force, produced by &quot;up&quot; elevator, forces the tail down and the nose up. At constant speed, the wing&#x27;s increased angle of attack causes a greater lift to be produced by the wing, accelerating the aircraft upwards. The drag and power demand also increase;
* a decreased downward force at the tail, produced by &quot;down&quot; elevator, causes the tail to rise and the nose to lower. At constant speed, the decrease in angle of attack reduces the lift, accelerating the aircraft downwards. 
On many low-speed aircraft, a trim tab is present at the rear of the elevator, which the pilot can adjust to eliminate forces on the control column at the desired attitude and airspeed. Supersonic aircraft usually have all-moving tailplanes (stabilators), because shock waves generated on the horizontal stabilizer greatly reduce the effectiveness of hinged elevators during supersonic flight. Delta winged aircraft combine ailerons and elevators –and their respective control inputs– into one control surface called an elevon.

==Elevators&#x27; location==
Elevators are usually part of the tail, at the rear of an aircraft. In some aircraft, pitch-control surfaces are in the front, ahead of the wing. In a two-surface aircraft this type of configuration is called a canard (the French word for duck) or a tandem wing. The Wright Brothers&#x27; early aircraft were of the canard type; Mignet Pou-du-Ciel and Rutan Quickie are of tandem type. Some early three surface aircraft had front elevators (Curtiss/AEA June Bug); modern three surface aircraft may have both front (canard) and rear elevators (Grumman X-29).

== Research ==
Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of aircraft flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.

In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing is a NASA effort. The Adaptive Compliant Wing is a military and commercial effort.

In fluidics, forces in vehicles occur via circulation control, in which larger more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller simpler fluidic systems (slots which emit air flows) where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In this use, fluidics promises lower mass, costs (up to 50% less), and very low inertia and response times, and simplicity.

<doc id="950995" wikidata="Q3757438" url="?curid=950995" title="The Great Explosion">
<text>The Great Explosion is a satirical science fiction novel by English writer Eric Frank Russell, first published in 1962. The story is divided into three sections. The final section is based on Russell&#x27;s 1951 short story &quot;...And Then There Were None&quot;. Twenty-three years after the novel was published, it won a Prometheus Hall of Fame Award.

==Plot==
The Blieder drive, a faster-than-light drive system, has permitted the population of Earth to colonize the galaxy. Each planet has become home for a particular social group. Four hundred years after the diaspora (the &quot;Great Explosion&quot; of the title), a spaceship from Earth visits three of the planets, the first steps to unifying the galaxy under a new Empire. The ship contains two thousand Terrans including many pompous officials, an army of bureaucrats, a military force and the ship&#x27;s crew, including some misfits. Things do not go entirely as hoped, as the incompetent military authoritarians of the ship encounter three very different societies.

The first planet was a penal colony; it is now many independent kleptocratic despotisms preying on each other. The second planet, Hygeia, is populated by health and fitness fanatic nudists. The third planet, Kassim, was colonized by a religious group, but when the ship arrives, the Terrans cannot find any human life, only empty villages overgrown by jungle. They decide not to land on the planet, because the captain fears that the colonists could have been killed by a disease and he doesn&#x27;t want to endanger the crew. The final planet, K22g, has developed an unusual social system. The population call themselves Gands (after Gandhi) and practise a form of classless, philosophically anarchic libertarianism, based on passive resistance (&quot;Freedom - I won&#x27;t!&quot; and &quot;Myob!&quot;); and a moneyless gift economy based on barter and favor-exchange, using &quot;obs&quot; (obligations). To perform a service for somebody &quot;lays an ob&quot; on them; they can then &quot;kill the ob&quot; by returning the favor. As the planet&#x27;s population are demonstrably non-hostile, the officials have to approve shore leave, which brings the crew into contact with the anarchist natives. Many find reasons to stay on the planet, refusing to return to the ship. The officials have to get the ship back into space before they lose so many that the ship will never fly again.

<doc id="950999" wikidata="Q1551265" url="?curid=950999" title="Street hockey">
<text>Street hockey (also known as shinny, dek hockey, ball hockey, road hockey or street roller hockey) is a collection of team sport variants played outdoors either on foot or with wheeled skates (either quad or in-line), using either a ball or puck designed for play on flat, dry surfaces. The object of every game is to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting the ball or puck into the opposing team&#x27;s net. All games are derivatives of either the sport of ice hockey, floor hockey, bandy, and/or field hockey.

Wheeled variants involve the use of inline or roller skates. and variously qualify as either inline hockey or rink hockey (also known as &quot;Quad hockey&quot;).

Street hockey in &quot;pickup&quot; form is generally played under the following guidelines since there are no &quot;official rules&quot; for local pickup hockey:

* Physical contact between players is extremely limited to avoid injury.
* Minimal or no hockey equipment is worn by the runners, depending on players&#x27; preferences.
* Players agree whether or not to allow slap shots and raising of the stick, both of which can incur serious injury to players, as there is minimal or no equipment worn.
* Players determine whether to use a hockey ball, a tennis ball, or a street hockey puck.
* There is no referee except when agreed upon by both teams.

Street hockey is commonly played on an outdoor surface (often a street, parking lot, tennis court, or other asphalt surface), which the genesis of the name street hockey. Teams are selected by various methods but usually are selected by captains via alternate selection of available players. Alternatively, all the players put their sticks in a pile and the sticks are tossed out of the pile to opposing sides. In more formally organized play, it is played in rinks often designed for roller hockey and can be indoor or outdoor rinks. There are also rinks built specifically for hockey played on foot, and they are referred to as dek hockey or ball hockey rinks. Such rinks can also be used for roller hockey games.

==History==

Road hockey is believed to have begun when roads started getting paved in wealthier parts of North America, around the turn of the 20th century. The term &quot;street hockey&quot; was thus started in Canada at some similar time, but a search of records on the internet and in several libraries by fans of hockey, in general, has not turned up an exact year. The sport and thus the term street hockey eventually spread south to the United States. Most people who play the sport generally agree that no single person or entity invented the term &quot;street hockey&quot; but that it simply invented itself, just like the term &quot;ice hockey,&quot; since it describes a form of hockey. People would literally play the game out in the street so they had to ask people to play by asking them if wanted to play hockey out in the street. All around the country, you will see many kids of all ages some as young as 6 years old playing this game. As children and teenagers, almost all ice hockey players work on their skills and practice their games by playing street hockey, often alone in driveways or out in the street in front of their houses. Which is common since, you do not need ice to play. These kids can play anywhere with a hard ground surface. Some kids even organize teams to compete against others. There are official games and tournaments these kids can join. Throughout the history of organized hockey, many professional ice players participate in various promotional street hockey games and charity events, often appearing as part of the respective National Hockey League team&#x27;s youth street hockey programs. Since not every ice hockey player can be on the ice at all times, the vast majority play some form of street hockey either for pure enjoyment, to better their overall hockey skills, or both.

Also, since the cost of smaller-sized home ice rinks was too expensive for professional players, many would often play street hockey throughout the summer months to keep in shape physically. That also offered them a chance to work on various different aspects of the game in a cost-effective manner. Before the era of big salaries, many semi-professional and professional players would play in pickup games with each other when they lived within driving distance of each other. In-line hockey is considered less expensive than ice hockey. Therefore, more likely for kids to play and keep up with, this can include their game and fitness.

It was only in the early 1970s, when Raymond W. Leclerc, the founder of the Mylec Corporation and the creator of the &quot;No Bounce&quot; orange ball, along with several prominent players in the Northeastern United States and Southeastern Canada, established rules for the more organized forms of the game. These rule were quickly adopted by most leagues in the area and then eventually spread throughout the US and Canada by a printed rulebook, which people could purchase. LeClerc is informally recognized as the &quot;Father of Street Hockey.&quot;

After a few years of experimenting with all the dynamics, Leclerc built a model site in 1974 to play and advance the game in Leominster, Massachusetts. The site, Leominster DekHockey Centre, has 3 outdoor rinks all with modular sport court surfaces and is informally known as the &quot;Home of DekHockey.&quot; The organized version of street hockey with teams competing in leagues caught on with a large number of players in Toronto, Montreal, Ontario, New York, Long Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. Various leagues and tournaments soon were springing up throughout those regions. The game then spread South and West as the Northeast US players relocated to different areas of the United States and Canadian players moved outside of the Ontario and Quebec provinces.

In Canada, the sport was organized for tournament play on a provincial and national level in the late 1970s, with the founding of the Canadian Ball Hockey Association. More formal organization of the sport quickly followed, which led to provincial tournaments and eventually the Canadian National Championships.

In the USA, the sport was organized for league/season play on a national and state level in 2020, with the formation of the National Ball Hockey League.

==Gameplay==

Street hockey is based on ice hockey, bandy, field hockey, or floor hockey and the overall purpose is the same: to score more goals than your opponent by shooting the ball or puck into the opposing team&#x27;s net using your stick.

=== Ice hockey variant ===

The ice hockey variant is less dangerous than ice hockey, and there are fewer incidents in in-line hockey. It is typically played on foot on some outdoor asphalt, cement or modular sport surface. The most popular balls of choice are orange &quot;no bounce&quot; plastic balls that are specifically made for street hockey, as well as tennis balls. Pucks are rarely used due to the playing surface, but, in some instances, a special puck designed with bearings for roller hockey can also be used. If a puck is used, generally the players agree for safety purposes to make every effort to keep the puck on the ground since the players generally don&#x27;t wear protective headgear and if a puck were to strike a player in the head it could cause serious medical injury and damage. Since they commonly use a water-filled ball, it is less dangerous than using a rubber puck. It is also safer because there are no skate blades or body checking like there is in ice hockey. Sometimes, street hockey is played with little protective equipment, therefore levels of physical contact are agreed upon beforehand by the participants. The game does permit a level of physical contact similar to that allowed in basketball.

Rules and playing styles can differ from area to area depending upon the traditions a certain group has set aside. In informal play, the game often begins one of two ways: 1) a so-called &quot;NHL face-off&quot;, in which the two opposing centers hit their sticks against each other three times saying &quot;N&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;L&quot;. Immediately following the &quot;L&quot; the two players fight to see who claims possession of the ball or puck 2) One team simply takes the ball or puck out from behind their goalie net, similar to how a basketball game resumes when one team scores a basket.

=== Dek and ball hockey ===
=== Floor hockey ===
Street hockey can also be played on indoor basketball courts and/or gymnasiums. However, these types of games fall under the category of floor hockey. In organized leagues, floor hockey often has specific rules in place that differ slightly from outdoor street hockey. The walls or fencing of these &quot;rinks&quot; serve to keep the ball, puck, or disc, in play similarly to the boards of an ice rink.

Floor hockey has several variants, uses either a puck or type of disk, but only one, called &quot;Cosom hockey&quot;, resembles the more conventional format of North American street hockey. Cosom hockey, and floorball are sometimes considered formal subsets of street hockey since they have such different rules.

;Cosom hockey
Cosom hockey is named for Cosom, a major supplier of physical education class equipment) and often uses a closed puck.

;Floorball
Floorball bears a resemblance to both field hockey and North American ice hockey, but is actually a variant of the ice team sport of bandy.

;Sam Jacks floor hockey
&quot;Sam Jacks&quot; floor hockey was developed in Canada in the 1930s but did not use a ball or puck, but a felt disc with a hole in its centre and required players to use straight bladeless sticks. Although it was this game, whose rules were codified by Sam Jacks in 1930s Canada that helped form the early conceptualization of ringette (also created by Sam Jacks) and was initially believed may become a type of &quot;court sport&quot;, ringette did not develop as a close ice variant relative of the floor hockey game. After its initial rules structure was developed by Mirl Arthur McCarthy, the game of basketball become more influential on the early foundational design of ringette. However, the early format of ringette was still in closer relationship to Jacks&#x27;s floor hockey than either the other floor variants, street hockey, or ice hockey.

;Gym ringette
Gym ringette should not be mistaken as a variant of either street hockey or floor hockey due to the fact that this game was designed in the latter half of 20th century Canada as an off-ice variant of the ice skating team sport of ringette.

=== New alternatives ===

==== Lacrosse boxes ====

A fairly new and popular alternative to playing hockey on the street in Canada is to play in outdoor lacrosse boxes. The lacrosse boxes contain the same asphalt surface as the streets, but offers a more realistic feeling of hockey since the playing area is larger than the average street, in addition to having boards that surround the lacrosse box. Players also do not need to worry about traffic and pedestrians. However, one downside to this is the smaller size of in-place lacrosse nets.

Similarly to lacrosse boxes, outdoor rinks are becoming quite popular in public areas around the United States. These rinks allow for a place to play off of what can often become dangerous streets. Outdoor rinks are usually covered in a sport interlocking plastic tile surface so equipment does not wear down as quickly as on asphalt. Some are concrete which is painted with a special paint designed to provide traction for feet and roller blades. Many rinks are also covered to allow play during wet weather, and lighted for nighttime hockey. There are also a large number of indoor rinks sprinkled throughout the United States and Canada. No official tally has been made as to the number of indoor rinks but the unofficial count is over 500 combining Canada and the United States.

==Equipment==
===North America===
In North America, equipment for street hockey is based of off designs which originated in ice hockey. This equipment has been designed to be lighter and more flexible due to the exclusion of body checks in street hockey. All of the ice hockey-style equipment is necessary except for certified helmets.

In pickup style games, most &quot;player tend to play with some combination of the following:

* hockey gloves
* shin guards
* eye protection
* athletic support
* mouth guards

Shin guards are often of the soccer type when the game is played on foot, though several companies now manufacturer and sell shin pads that are lightweight, durable, and have been specifically designed and marketed for street hockey and roller hockey (either inline hockey or quad hockey).

==== Goaltenders ====
Goalies still typically wear equipment similar in appearance to their ice hockey counterparts for safety but partly also to help block more of the goal area. However, such goalie equipment used in street hockey is generally lighter than that used in ice hockey due to the reduced weight and density of the ball (or puck) that is typically used in street hockey as compared to the hard vulcanized rubber puck used in ice hockey.

==== Sticks ====
A street hockey stick is similar to an ice hockey stick in shape and size, but made of materials that will better stand up to use on asphalt or a similar playing surface. It has two main parts, the shaft and the blade. The shaft is often made of aluminum, graphite, or wood. The blade is usually made of some type of plastic, typically a blend of polyurethane, and attaches to the shaft by insertion into the shaft, with the inside of the shaft being coated with a specialized type of glue that requires heating to settle and solidify. Other shafts are designed to have the blade screwed onto the shaft and secured in place with screws. Some street hockey sticks are made in one-piece form and are made out of plastic, polyurethane, graphite, aluminum, wood, or a blend of these and other materials. Ice hockey and inline hockey sticks can also be used. However, street hockey sticks are usually cheaper and more durable for playing on asphalt and concrete, and as such are more common for this reason where the game is played on those surfaces. In organized dek and ball hockey leagues, most players use more expensive sticks as the quality of game play is much higher caliber than pickup street hockey and the Mulit Modular Surfaces see the games played which allow a safer and faster version of Dekhockey and are much safer for running that concrete or blacktop.

==== Street ball ====

With the success of the widely used orange ball for street hockey, many different color varieties have been introduced due to changing balls for weather conditions, such as yellow, red, pink, and even a glow in the dark ball. Several ball manufacturers now market the balls with the temperature range the ball was designed for on the packaging itself. Most hockey ball manufacturers sell their balls according to the following temperature range: red/orange = hot/warm above 60 degrees, pink = cool - between 40-60 degrees, yellow = cold - below 40 degrees. A tennis ball or whiffle ball can also be used as an alternative to the orange ball for street hockey, as it is much softer than the orange ball, therefore reducing the risk of injury.

;International rules
The International Street and Ball Hockey Federation is the worldwide governing body of official ball hockey tournaments and leagues, and they officially recognize two types of balls for play: a hard, warm climate ball for adult or youth play or a softer version for colder weather.

==Governing bodies==

===International===
The International Street and Ball Hockey Federation is officially recognized as the governing body of the sport by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The non-profit was founded in 1993 and has provided international competitions since 1995.

===North America===
The Canadian Ball Hockey Association is the official governing body of ball hockey in Canada as recognized by the I.S.B.H.F.
USA Ball Hockey is the official governing body of street and dek hockey in the United States as recognized by the I.S.B.H.F.

The National Ball Hockey League is the first officially sanctioned league by USA Ball Hockey the official governing body of street and dek hockey in the United States as recognized by the I.S.B.H.F.

===Europe and Asia===
Several European and Asian countries have their own governing bodies where the sport has enough players to have a national following and presence. Generally, these countries have rule books based upon either the Canadian, American, or I.S.B.H.F. rule books, or a combination of some type of these.

==Tournaments==

===International===
The International Street and Ball Hockey Federation holds several international tournaments with most being broken down by age groups and gender. These tournaments are typically bi-annual, such as the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s 20 and over, the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Under 20, the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Under 18 and the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Under 16. There are also a Men&#x27;s Masters Tournament for players aged 40 and over and a Women&#x27;s Masters Tournament for players aged 35 and over.

===North America===
There are dozens of tournaments held throughout North America every year. Typically, tournaments start on a Friday and end on Sunday evenings.

===Popularity===

According to the ISBHF, there are street hockey leagues in over 60 countries worldwide. As mentioned in the history section, one can safely assume that where ever people are playing ice hockey, people are also playing some form of street hockey.

<doc id="951011" wikidata="Q4052255" url="?curid=951011" title="USS Mugford (DD-389)">
<text>USS &quot;Mugford&quot; (DD-389), a &quot;Bagley&quot;-class destroyer, was the 2nd ship of the United States Navy to be named for James Mugford, who commanded the schooner &quot;Franklin&quot; in the Continental Navy, serving through 1775.

==Construction==
The second &quot;Mugford&quot; was laid down 28 October 1935 by Boston Navy Yard; launched 31 October 1936; sponsored by Miss Madeline Orne; and commissioned 16 August 1937.

==Operational history==
Joining the Pacific Fleet in late 1937, &quot;Mugford&quot; conducted local operations along the West Coast and around the Hawaiian Islands, taking time out for periodic overhauls and upkeep. From 5 June 1939 to 30 July 1940 she was the first command of then Lieutenant Commander Arleigh Burke, and under his command was awarded a Battle &quot;E&quot; for gunnery excellence. 7 December 1941 found her at Pearl Harbor as flagship of Destroyer Division Eight of Destroyer Squadron Four. When the attack began, &quot;Mugford&quot; was on standby status, berthed at B6 in the Navy Yard for repairs, and while raising steam to get underway, downed three planes in 10 minutes with her antiaircraft guns. Within an hour after the attack began, the &quot;little ship&quot; was steaming out of Pearl Harbor firing as she went. Her next major duty was to screen the Wake Island relief force and after completion of this duty served as an escort for convoys traveling between the United States and Australia. She served in this capacity until mid‑1942.

On 7 August, &quot;Mugford&quot; was on patrol off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, when a large Japanese airstrike came in; three near misses and one bomb hit couldn’t prevent &quot;Mugford&quot; from downing two of her attackers, but she suffered eight killed, 17 wounded, and 10 missing. Next day she shot down another enemy aircraft in a raid in which she suffered no damage, and rescued two enemy aviators from the water. On the 9th, she sped toward the action of the first Battle of Savo Island, arriving in time to pull 400 survivors of &quot;Vincennes&quot; (CA-44) and &quot;Astoria&quot; (CA-34) from the water.

After battle damage repairs at Sydney, from 16 September through December, she operated on patrol in the Coral Sea and along Australia’s northern coast. Brisbane was her base for continued patrol, as well as escort missions to Milne Bay, New Guinea, which became her base later in the summer as New Guinea operations took on a faster pace. She joined in the assault on Woodlark Island in July, conducted shore bombardment and patrols in that general area in August, and in September escorted LSTs to the invasion of Lae on the 4th, after which she patrolled offshore while under enemy air attack. Later that month she conducted preinvasion bombardment north of Finschafen, off which she served until late in October. On 20 October, she and four companion destroyers were attacked by 60 enemy planes; &quot;Mugford&quot; suffered no damage.

On 15 May 1943, the &quot;Mugford&quot; rescued the survivors of the Australian hospital ship AHS &quot;Centaur&quot; off Point Lookout, Queensland, after &quot;Centaur&quot; had been sunk by a Japanese submarine the previous day.

On 14 and 15 December, she participated in the largest operation yet in the New Guinea campaign, the landings on Arawe, New Britain. Next was the assault on Buna and Cape Gloucester, where on Christmas Day she came under enemy air attack, taking three near misses in a first attack, and shooting down an attacker in a second assault later the same day. One man was killed, six wounded, and the ship riddled with shrapnel with some small holes below the waterline.

After repairs at Milne Bay, &quot;Mugford&quot; returned to patrol, bombardment, and escort missions for the New Guinea operation, sailing off Saidor. On 10 January 1944 she sailed for Sydney, then returned to New Guinea and escort and patrol duty in Huon Gulf. After escorting three merchantmen from Tulagi to the Union Islands, &quot;Mugford&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor 24 February to escort &quot;Maryland&quot; (BB-46) to Puget Sound, before continuing on to Mare Island for overhaul, arriving 5 March.

&quot;Mugford&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 10 May for training in preparation for the Marianas operation, for which she staged at Majuro. Screening the fast carriers, she observed the first strike the morning of 11 June, then screened battleships bombarding Saipan and Tinian, firing night harassing missions herself and screening night retirements. She rejoined the carrier screen as word came of the approach of an enemy carrier force, and thus played a role in the epic Battle of the Philippine Sea, when Japanese naval aviation was all but annihilated in a decisive victory. She continued patrol and escort missions in the Marianas and Marshalls as preparations were made to invade Guam, during which action &quot;Mugford&quot; served as radar picket between Guam and Rota. On 28 August, she sortied with TF 38 for surface bombardment and airstrikes on enemy shipping and installations in the Bonins, Yap, and Palau, covering the Palau invasion in September. Early in October, TF 38 struck at Okinawa, and on the return voyage hit at Formosa and Luzon. The enemy mustered as strong an air attack as it could on 12 and 13 October, and &quot;Mugford&quot; shared in downing many of the attackers while protecting the vulnerable carriers.

With the Leyte invasion now underway, TG 38.4, with &quot;Mugford&quot;, sped to meet the threat posed by major Japanese fleet movements, and on 24 October, planes from the force hit the Japanese Center Force in the Mindanao Sea, then headed north on receiving reports of a Japanese carrier force off northern Luzon. The next day strikes were flown against the Japanese, opening the Battle off Cape Engaño phase of the American victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Further action came 30 October, when a Japanese airstrike damaged &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6), &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; (CVL-24), and &quot;Franklin&quot; (CV-13). &quot;Mugford&quot; and other destroyers guarded the damaged ships to safety at Ulithi, repaired their own damage, and returned to patrol duty in Leyte Gulf.

On 5 December, &quot;Mugford&quot; spotted enemy aircraft attacking amphibious craft passing through her patrol area in Surigao Strait. She sped to protect them, and late in the action was crashed by a “Val” dive bomber. She was badly damaged, and lost eight men killed, 14 wounded. Making temporary repairs, &quot;Mugford&quot; pulled into San Pedro under her own steam. She was ordered to the United States for permanent repairs at Mare Island 5 January 1945 to 4 March 1945.

Returning to the western Pacific in mid‑March, &quot;Mugford&quot; served as radar picket and on antisubmarine patrol between Ulithi and Saipan until the close of the war. She served in TG 55.7 repatriating Allied prisoners of war from Japan to Okinawa early in September, then screened carriers providing air support for the occupation of the Nagasaki‑Sasebo area. She continued on occupation duty until returning to San Diego 19 November. Here she was stripped and prepared for participation in the Bikini atomic tests (see Operation Crossroads), during which she decommissioned 29 August 1946. Retained for experiments in decontamination, she was finally sunk off Kwajalein 22 March 1948.

<text>Henry Darrow (born Enrique Tomás Delgado Jiménez; September 15, 1933 – March 14, 2021) was an American character actor of stage and film known for his role as Manolito &quot;Mano&quot; Montoya on the 1960s television series &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;. In film, Darrow played the corrupt and vengeful Trooper Hancock in &quot;The Hitcher&quot;. During the 1970s and 1980s, he was seen in numerous guest starring television roles. Darrow replaced Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Zorro&#x27;s father Don Alejandro de la Vega in the 1990s television series &quot;Zorro&quot;.

== Early years ==
Darrow&#x27;s parents had moved from Puerto Rico to New York in the early 1930s. At the age of eight, he played a woodcutter in a school play, an experience which convinced him that his destiny was as an actor.

In 1946, when Darrow was 13, his family returned to Puerto Rico, where he discovered his roots and grew to love the island he had not known. He graduated from Academia del Perpetuo Socorro high school in Miramar, Puerto Rico, as class president before enrolling in the University of Puerto Rico. There he studied political science and acting, and worked as a part-time English-language interpreter. During his third year at the university, he was awarded a scholarship (the first of its kind) to attend acting school. Thereupon Darrow moved to Los Angeles, where he enrolled in the Pasadena Playhouse. He met and married his first wife, Louise whom he referred to as Lucy, they went on to have two children, Denise and Tom. Darrow graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in theater arts.

== Acting career ==

Darrow had already landed small parts in 12 movies and 75 television series when he won the role in a 1965 stage production of &quot;The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit&quot;. This brought him to the attention of television producer David Dortort, who immediately recruited him for his television western series &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, casting him as Manolito Montoya. Making its debut on American television in September 1967 (NBC), it lasted four seasons and was screened around the world. While on the show, both he and series&#x27; lead Cameron Mitchell became household names as the breakout stars of the show.

Darrow was the first Latino actor to portray Zorro on television. (José Suárez played Zorro in a 1953 Spanish film.) He starred in the series &quot;Zorro and Son&quot; and also provided the voice for the animated series of &quot;The New Adventures of Zorro&quot;. He replaced Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as Zorro&#x27;s father from 1990 to 1994 in the Family Channel&#x27;s successful series &quot;The New Zorro&quot;.

In 1972, Darrow co-founded the Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Minority Committee with actors Ricardo Montalbán, Edith Diaz and Carmen Zapata.

In 1974-75, Darrow portrayed police detective Manny Quinlan in the first season of &quot;Harry O&quot; starring David Janssen. The character was killed off at the end of the first season in a retooling of the series.

In 1986, he appeared in the horror film &quot;The Hitcher&quot; as Trooper Hancock, a ruthless and vengeful policeman who would go above the law to kill the main protagonist (who was framed for the crimes by the main antagonist).

== Later years ==
Darrow was a member of the board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and a member of SAG&#x27;s Ethnic Minorities Committee. He was also a founder of Nosotros, an organization helping Latino actors land non-stereotyped parts. Darrow served on the Advisory Committee of Bilingual Children&#x27;s Television. In his later years, Darrow had cut back on his public appearances.

Darrow died of natural causes on March 14, 2021, at the age of 87.

<text>An anti-social behaviour order (ASBO ) is a civil order made in the United Kingdom against a person who had been shown, on the balance of evidence, to have engaged in anti-social behaviour. The orders were introduced by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1998, and continued in use until abolished in England and Wales by the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 on 20 October 2014—although they continue to be used in Scotland and Northern Ireland. ASBOs were replaced in England and Wales by the civil injunctions and criminal behaviour orders. They were designed to address behaviours like intimidation, drunkenness, and violence by individuals and families, using civil orders rather than criminal sanctions. The orders restricted behaviour in some way, such as: prohibiting a return to a certain area or shop; or restricting public behaviours, such as swearing or drinking alcohol. Many saw the ASBOs as connected with young delinquents.

They are closely related to fixed penalty notices and related schemes such as penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) and penalty charge notices (PCNs), in both intent and date of introduction.

==History==
ASBOs were introduced in England, Scotland, and Wales through the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and in Northern Ireland by The Anti-social Behaviour (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. Later legislation strengthened its application: in England and Wales, this was largely via the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 and in Scotland with the Antisocial and Sexual Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004. Scotland, however, had a pre-existing tribunal system charged with dealing with children and young persons who offend, the Children&#x27;s Hearings system.

In a press release of 28 October 2004, Tony Blair and David Blunkett announced further measures to extend the use and definition of ASBOs. The remit included:
* Extension of the Witness Protection Programme in anti-social behaviour cases
* More courts dealing with cases
* More offences, including dog-fouling, litter, graffiti, and night-time noise liable for fixed penalty notices
* Giving parish councils the power to issue fixed penalty notices for infringements

The press release concluded by remarking:

On 25 October 2005, Transport for London announced its intent to apply for a new law giving them the authority to issue orders against repeat fare dodgers, and increased fines. By 31 March 2004, 2,455 ASBOs had been issued in England and Wales. On 30 March 2006, the Home Office announced that 7,356 ASBOs had been given out since 1999 in England and Wales.

=== Replacement ===

The 2010 coalition government expressed its intention to replace ASBOs, citing the reasons that &quot;breach rates are high, and the number issued has been steadily declining since 2005.&quot; In July 2010, Home Secretary Theresa May announced her intention to reform anti-social behaviour measures for England and Wales, with the abolition of ASBOs in due course in favour of alternative &quot;community-based&quot; social control policies. However, in 2012, Liberal Democrat objections prevented the implementation of proposals in a Home Office White Paper to replace the ASBO with a &quot;criminal behaviour order&quot; and a &quot;crime prevention injunction&quot;. In May 2013, an Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill was introduced into the House of Commons, including a provision to create &quot;injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance&quot;, replacing ASBOs in England and Wales. The bill was criticised for the broad and undefined scope of &quot;nuisance and annoyance&quot;, and was rejected by the House of Lords in January 2014.

The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 received Royal Assent in March 2014. This streamlined the tools available to tackle anti-social behaviour, and replaced the ASBO with an injunction (a civil order) and a criminal behaviour order (CBO) in England and Wales.

==What warrants an ASBO==

===Uses===
An ASBO can be issued in response to &quot;conduct which caused or was likely to cause harm, harassment, alarm, or distress, to one or more persons not of the same household as him or herself, and where an ASBO is seen as necessary to protect relevant persons from further anti-social acts by the defendant.&quot; In England and Wales, they were issued by magistrates&#x27; courts; they are issued in Scotland by the sheriff courts and in Northern Ireland by magistrates&#x27; courts.

The British government introduced ASBOs through the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. In the UK, a &quot;CRASBO&quot; was a &quot;criminally related&quot; ASBO. One local authority published photos of those given ASBOs on an Internet site. Anti-social behaviour included a range of behaviours, such as:

* abandoning cars
* arson
* begging
* casteism
* dangerous driving
* defecating/urinating in public
* disturbing the peace
* dogging (exhibitionistic public sex)
* drug dealing/consumption of controlled recreational drugs
* drunken behaviour
* fare evasion
* intimidation
* littering/fly tipping/dog fouling
* loitering (with intent)
* noise pollution
* paedophilic activity
* racism and xenophobia
* rioting
* rudeness
* smoking in public places
* spitting
* stealing/mugging/shoplifting
* urban exploration
* vandalism/criminal damage/graffiti

===Standard of proof===
Applications for ASBOs were heard by magistrates sitting in their civil capacity. Although the proceedings were civil, the court had to apply a heightened civil standard of proof. This standard was virtually indistinguishable from the criminal standard. The applicant had to satisfy the court &quot;so that it is sure&quot; that the defendant has acted in an anti-social manner. The test for the court to be &quot;satisfied so that it is sure&quot; was the same direction that a judge gives to a jury in a criminal case heard in the Crown Court, and is also known as satisfying the court &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;.

Pursuant to section 1(1) Civil Evidence Act 1995, an applicant (and a defendant) had the right to rely on witness statements without calling the makers of those statements—known as hearsay. If a party proposed to rely upon a hearsay statement, then the other party was entitled to ask the court for permission to call that witness for cross-examination.

If the court refused to grant such an application, then the defendant would be unable to cross examine the makers of the hearsay statements. Nevertheless, it was open to them, in accordance with the Civil Evidence Act, to submit that the court should place little or no weight upon material that had not been tested by way of cross examination.

Section 4(1) Civil Evidence Act 1995 states that:

The High Court has emphasised that the use of the words &quot;if any&quot; shows that some hearsay evidence may be given no weight at all. For an ASBO to be made, the applicant had to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the respondent had behaved in an anti-social manner. The applicant could rely on hearsay evidence. However, the Court of Appeal has stated that it does not expect a court to find that the criminal standard has been reached by relying solely on hearsay evidence. The Civil Evidence Act 1995 itself makes clear that courts should consider what weight, if any at all, attaches to hearsay material. In &quot;Cleary&quot;, the Court of Appeal again restated that courts should consider attaching no weight at all to such material, in accordance with the words of the statute.

It is for the court to decide what weight to give the hearsay evidence. The Court of Appeal has stated that the high standard of proof is difficult to meet if the entirety of the case, or the majority of it, is based upon hearsay evidence. The proper approach would be for a court to consider to what extent the hearsay evidence is, amongst other things, supported by other evidence, the cogency and similarity of supporting instances of hearsay evidence, and the cogency and reliability of contradictory evidence supplied by a defendant.

Where, for example, ten anonymous witnesses who are unrelated to each other each provide a witness statement as to the defendant&#x27;s anti-social behaviour, where each statement refers independently to the same particular events, and where this is supported by a witness statement from a non-anonymous witness, such as a housing officer who confirms that residents have made complaints about a particular person over a period of time, then the court may be justified in according to the statements a fair degree of weight.

===Typical ASBOs===
An ASBO was an order of the court which told an individual aged over 10 years how they must not behave.

An order could contain only negative prohibitions. It could not contain a positive obligation. To obtain an ASBO, a two-stage test had to be satisfied by the applicant authority (see: s.1(1) Crime and Disorder Act 1998). The first test was that the defendant had committed acts causing or likely to cause harassment, alarm, or distress within six months of the date of issue of the summons. The second test was that an order was necessary to protect persons from further anti-social behaviour.

The applicant had to satisfy the court that the individual had acted in an anti-social manner—that is to say, in a manner that caused, or was likely to cause, harassment, alarm, or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as themself. A court could order an ASBO only if such an order was &quot;necessary&quot;. Further, each prohibited act would usually be an act preparatory to a criminal offence, rather than the offence itself—but not always (see: &quot;Rabess v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis&quot; [2007] EWHC 208 (Admin)). In addition, each prohibition itself had to be necessary. 

An order had to be tailor-made for the individual defendant. The ASBO represented &quot;a form of personalised criminal law.&quot; It had to be relevant to their particular anti-social behaviour. Orders should not have been drafted too widely or imprecisely. Each prohibition had to be necessary.

An ASBO was very similar to a civil injunction, even though the differences are important. First: the injunction was supposed to protect the world at large, in a given geographical area, rather than an individual. Second: breach of an ASBO was a criminal offence to be tried in a criminal court, applying the criminal standard of beyond all reasonable doubt. A power of committal to prison was available for breach of a civil injunction, but a court was unlikely to exercise that power. A person subject to an anti-social behaviour order where it did not follow a criminal conviction had an automatic right of appeal against both the making of the order and its terms to a higher court. There was also the availability of an appeal to the High Court by way of &quot;case stated&quot;. There was no appeal against the variation of orders, and variation was used to add extra conditions, and to extend the duration of ASBOs.

An application for an ASBO was considered by the courts in its civil jurisdiction, and was a civil order. However, breach of an ASBO was a criminal offence, and conviction could result in up to five years&#x27; imprisonment (two for a minor). Subsequent legislation compelled magistrates to make a Parenting Order, where a person under the age of 16 breached their ASBO.

Other examples:
* Abusive behaviour
* Begging
* Flyposting
* Harassment
* Organising illegal raves
* Suicide attempts
* Theft
* Vandalism

===Less common ASBOs===

Less common and more conventional uses of ASBOs, as listed by a report to the Home Office to illustrate the difficulties with ASBOs, include:
* Two teenage boys from east Manchester forbidden to wear one golf glove, as it was a symbol of membership of a particular gang.
* A 13-year-old forbidden to use the word &quot;grass&quot; as a term of abuse in order to threaten people.
* A 15-year-old forbidden to play football in his street.
* A farmer (the first to be given an ASBO) who was instructed to keep his geese and pigs from damaging his neighbour&#x27;s property.
* An 18-year-old ordered not to congregate with three or more other youths. He entered a local youth club that had a good reputation, and was arrested because there were more than three youths on the premises. He was intending to attend an event there on how to deal with anti-social behaviour.

==Ireland==
The Republic of Ireland implemented an ASBO system in 2007. Breaches of ASBOs can lead to a fine of up to 3000 euros or a prison sentence of up to six months. As of 2012 only seven had been issued but in 2020 alone thirty were issued.

==Reception==

From their inception, ASBOs were controversial. They were criticised as being &quot;without strong and principled justification&quot;, a distraction from the failure of the government&#x27;s law and order policies, a &quot;recipe for institutionalised vigilantism&quot;, and an &quot;emblem of punitive populism&quot;. Andrew Rutherford commented that the &quot;ASBO provides a particularly striking example of the criminalisation of social policy&quot;. A MORI opinion poll published on 9 June 2005 found that 82% of the British public were in favour of ASBOs; however, only 39% believed they were effective in their current form. A 2012 survey by Angus Reid Public Opinion showed that only 8% of Britons believed ASBOs had been successful in curbing anti-social behaviour in the UK.

Other parties voiced concerns about the open-ended nature of ASBO penalties—that is, there was little restriction on what a court was able to impose as the terms of the ASBO, and little restriction on what could be designated as antisocial behaviour. In 2005, critics reported that around 3% of ASBO applications had been turned down. In July 2007, the Local Government Ombudsman published a report criticising Manchester City Council for serving an ASBO based purely on uncorroborated reports of nuisance by a neighbour, and the Council agreed to pay £2000 in compensation.

A 2005 memorandum submitted by the National Association of Probation Officers (NAPO) asserted that &quot;there is ample evidence of the issuing of ASBOs by the courts being inconsistent and almost a geographical lottery. There is great concern that people are being jailed following the breach of an ASBO, where the original offence was itself non-imprisonable. There is also evidence that ASBOs have been used where people have mental health problems where treatment would be more appropriate. In NAPO&#x27;s view, the time is right for a fundamental review of the use and appropriateness of Anti-social Behaviour Orders by the Home Office.&quot;

In 2002, Home Office data stated that in the cases where information was available, there was a high proportion where some mitigating factor appeared to have contributed to their behaviour. Almost used substances, and were consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Overall, 44% were engaging in substance use or had a learning disability, and a further 16% included persons with psychological and behaviour problems in the family. Similar results were found in Scotland. A casefile review showed that 55% of those given ASBOs had substance use disorders, mental health, or learning disability problems.

In 2005, a survey of Youth Offending Teams by the British Institute for Brain Injured Children showed that 38% of ASBOs went to young people with significant mental disorders. Problems included: clinical depression, suicidal tendencies, autism, psychosis, personality disorders, learning disabilities, and ADHD; this raised the question of whether young people with these illnesses should be held to a lower standard of behaviour than others. By contrast, the same survey of ASBO teams gave only a 5% reported incidence of mental impairment. This massive difference suggests that most ASBO teams did not take into account mental health problems, even though the Home Office safeguards for vulnerable people in the ASBO process required it.

ASBO effectiveness was also questioned. In response to a House of Commons question, it was stated that 53.7% of ASBOs were breached in England in 2005; 69.4% in 2006; and 70.3% in 2007. In large cities, rates could be higher: the breach rate in Manchester reached 90.2% in 2007. This level of breaching raised an interesting issue. The first test to justify the issuing of an ASBO was that anti-social behaviour (ASB) had been proved to the criminal standard. The second test was that the order was necessary to prevent future acts of ASB, and provide protection to the victim(s). However, the criminal standard was not applied to the second test. Indeed, Lord Steyn stated:

According to government evaluations (e.g. &quot;Housing Research Summary No. 230&quot;; DfCLG) in the &quot;ASB Intensive Family Support&quot; (Sin Bin) projects introduced to supplement ASBOs, 80% of the families targeted had serious mental/physical health and learning disability problems; one in five families had children affected with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and 60% of the families were recognised as victims of ASB. Project managers described many families as &quot;easily scapegoated&quot; in neighbour disputes. HRS 230 called for a review of both ASBO policy and investigation procedures in order to make the whole process fairer.

A later study of 53 projects by the National Centre For Social Research noted that 42% of children with mental health problems were reported to have ADHD or hyperactivity, and 29% were reported with depression or stress. Amongst adults, 69% had depression.

In the UK, there was criticism that an ASBO was sometimes viewed as a badge of honour by the youth.

Nacro, the biggest criminal justice-related charity in England and Wales, published two reports: the first claimed that ASBOs were a failure, due to being costly and slow to obtain; and the second criticised their use by the courts, with assertions that they were being used too hastily, before alternatives had been tried.

<text>Sean Charles Watkins (born February 18, 1977) is an American guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. He is a member of the contemporary folk band Nickel Creek, the duo Fiction Family and the supergroup Works Progress Administration. He is the brother of Sara Watkins.

==Career==

===Nickel Creek===
Sean Watkins began his tenure with Nickel Creek playing mandolin, but later switched to guitar. The band has released six albums and a CD composed of their hits (called &quot;Reasons Why: The Very Best&quot;) and won a Grammy for &quot;This Side&quot; – a coveted trophy that Watkins reportedly put on top of his toilet at home. Explaining the somewhat odd situation, Watkins said that &quot;it seems like a humble place. I didn&#x27;t want to put it out in plain view of my house. I didn&#x27;t feel like displaying it right when you walk in. It&#x27;s a nice crown for the porcelain.&quot; In addition to playing with Nickel Creek, Watkins has released multiple solo albums.

As a solo musician, his early material was contemporary bluegrass, but he has since incorporated other influences into his music (especially indie rock.) Watkins&#x27; solo music career seems to reflect Nickel Creek&#x27;s: turning from traditional bluegrass songs to indie rock with bluegrass instrumentation. He is the oldest member of Nickel Creek. Sean qualified for the National Flatpicking Championship in 1993 at age 16.

His sister Sara Watkins, also a member of Nickel Creek, plays violin and sings background vocals on the two latest of his three solo albums. In 2004, Nickel Creek participated in a project dubbed &quot;Mutual Admiration Society&quot;, a collaboration with former Toad The Wet Sprocket singer Glen Phillips. Sean and Sara are also part of the 2007 soundtrack for the psychological thriller &quot;Bug&quot; with the track &quot;No Way to Live&quot;.

===Current projects===
In 2006, Sean and Switchfoot frontman Jon Foreman started a collaborating duo called The Real SeanJon. In March 2008, the duo announced that they had changed their band name to Fiction Family. In a spring 2008 interview, Jon Foreman said that the album would have a summer 2008 release and the duo was considering having the album be distributed by Starbucks. However, a September 2008 press release by Nickel Creek confirmed that the album, &quot;Fiction Family&quot;, is to be released on January 20, 2009, on ATO Records.

In January 2008, it was reported by Billboard that a new supergroup octet tentatively named The Scrolls had formed, now known officially as Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.). The octet is composed of Watkins, his sister Sara Watkins (fiddle), Glen Phillips (guitar, vocals), Benmont Tench (piano), Luke Bulla (fiddle), Greg Leisz (various), Pete Thomas (drums), and Davey Faragher (bass). The group released their self-titled debut album on August 28, 2009. As the group continued, the lead singer-songwriters Watkins (Sean), Phillips, and Bulla were considered the core group and were supported by others when their projects made it possible. Bulla is no longer considered part of the group and as of summer 2011, their most recent lineup was Watkins and Phillips supported by Jerry Roe on drums and Sebastian Steinberg on bass guitar.

Sean and sister Sara play regularly at the Largo nightclub in Los Angeles as &quot;The Watkins Family Hour&quot;. Keyboardist Benmont Tench (of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) and bassist Sebastian Steinberg (formerly of Soul Coughing) are regular participants and other guest musicians from the Largo family generally show up as well, including Jon Brion, Fiona Apple, Don Heffington, Greg Leisz, and former Nickel Creek bandmate Chris Thile when he is in town. The irregular collaboration lead to a 2015 album and tour under the same name.

Sean has also frequently supported his sister Sara on guitar and vocals for her solo dates since the release of her debut album in April 2009.

In addition, Watkins plans to release what he calls &quot;15 minutes of noise&quot; as a digital download on his website. He said that the final product was &quot;very strange&quot;, and that there would &quot;be some cool art to go with it&quot;.

In October 2013, Sean announced that he had completed a record entitled &quot;All I Do Is Lie&quot;, which was released in June 2014.

== Personal Life ==
Sean married musician Dominique Arciero on October 19th, 2019 in Vista, California. They currently reside in northeast Los Angeles, California.

<text>Anacreon (; ; BC) was a Greek lyric poet, notable for his drinking songs and erotic poems. Later Greeks included him in the canonical list of Nine Lyric Poets. Anacreon wrote all of his poetry in the ancient Ionic dialect. Like all early lyric poetry, it was composed to be sung or recited to the accompaniment of music, usually the lyre. Anacreon&#x27;s poetry touched on universal themes of love, infatuation, disappointment, revelry, parties, festivals, and the observations of everyday people and life.

== Life ==
Anacreon lived in the sixth century BC. His exact year of birth is not known, with the general scholarly consensus being that he was likely born in the 570s BC: Hans Bernsdorff says c. 575, David Campbell says c. 570. The Suda reports four possible names for his father: Eumelus, Aristocritus, Parthenius, and Scythinus. Ancient sources agree that Anacreon came from Teos, on the coast of Ionia (modern Turkey); this tradition is attested as early as Herodotus, and at least one of Anacreon&#x27;s fragments mentions the city. When Teos was conquered by Persia in the 540s BC, the Teians moved to Abdera, Thrace; Anacreon was probably already an adult.
Anacreon spent time in Samos. According to Himerius, he was invited there to educate Polycrates, the future tyrant of Samos, who Strabo reports was one of the main subjects of his poetry. If Himerius is correct and Anacreon arrived on Samos before Polycrates became tyrant, this would have been before 530 BC. From Samos, Anacreon moved to Athens on the invitation of Hipparchus, presumably sometime after Hipparchus came to power in 528/7; according to Herodotus he was still on Samos in 522 when Polycrates was murdered.

Ancient sources do not record if or when Anacreon left Athens. He may have left after the assassination of his patron Hipparchus in 514, or the expulsion of Hipparchus&#x27; brother Hippias in 510, though there is some evidence of his presence in the city later than this. Two epigrams from the Greek Anthology suggest that he spent some time in Thessaly, though Gregory Hutchinson doubts this tradition. 

Anacreon probably died at the beginning of the fifth century: Hutchinson says around 500, Bernsdorff suggests 495, and Campbell says 485. According to Valerius Maximus, he died by choking on a grape seed, though this is generally considered apocryphal. An epigram in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; says that his tomb was on Teos.

==Poetry==

===Form and style===

Anacreon wrote all of his poetry in the ancient Ionic dialect. Like all early lyric poetry, it was composed to be sung or recited to the accompaniment of music, usually the lyre. Anacreon&#x27;s verses were primarily in the form of monody rather than for a chorus.

In keeping with Greek poetic tradition, his poetry relied on the meter for its construction. Metrical poetry is a particularly rhythmic form, deriving its structure from patterns of phonetic features within and between the lines of verse. The phonetic patterning in Anacreon&#x27;s poetry, like all the Greek poetry of the day, is found in the structured alternation of &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; syllables. The Ionic dialect also had a tonal aspect to it that lends a natural melodic quality to the recitation. Anacreon&#x27;s meters include the anacreonteus.

The Greek language is particularly well suited to this metrical style of poetry but the sound of the verses does not easily transfer to English. As a consequence, translators have historically tended to substitute rhyme, stress rhythms, stanzaic patterning and other devices for the style of the originals, with the primary, sometimes only, connection to the Greek verses being the subject matter. More recent translators have tended to attempt a more spare translation which, though losing the sound of the originals, may be more true to their flavor. A sample of a translation in the English rhyming tradition is included below.

===Themes and subjects===
Anacreon&#x27;s poetry touched on universal themes of love, infatuation, disappointment, revelry, parties, festivals, and observations of everyday people and life. It is the subject matter of Anacreon&#x27;s poetry that helped to keep it familiar and enjoyable to generations of readers and listeners. His widespread popularity inspired countless imitators, which also kept his name alive.

Anacreon had a reputation as a composer of hymns, as well as of those bacchanalian and amatory lyrics which are commonly associated with his name. Two short hymns to Artemis and Dionysus, consisting of eight and eleven lines respectively, stand first amongst his few undisputed remains, as printed by recent editors. But hymns, especially when addressed to such deities as Aphrodite, Eros and Dionysus, are not so very unlike what we call &quot;Anacreontic&quot; poetry as to make the contrast of style as great as the word might seem to imply. The tone of Anacreon&#x27;s lyric effusions has probably led to an unjust estimate, by both ancients and moderns, of the poet&#x27;s personal character. The &quot;triple worship&quot; of the Muses, Wine and Love, ascribed to him as his religion in an old Greek epigram, may have been as purely professional in the two last cases as in the first, and his private character on such points was probably neither much better nor worse than that of his contemporaries. Athenaeus remarks acutely that he seems at least to have been sober when he wrote. His character was an issue, because, according to Pausanias, his statue on the Acropolis of Athens depicts him as drunk. He himself strongly repudiates, as Horace does, the brutal characteristics of intoxication as fit only for barbarians and Scythians.

Of the five books of lyrical pieces by Anacreon which the &quot;Suda&quot; and Athenaeus mention as extant in their time, only the merest fragments exist today, collected from the citations of later writers.

A collection of poems by numerous, anonymous imitators was long believed to be the works of Anacreon himself. Known as the &quot;Anacreontea&quot;, it was preserved in a 10th-century manuscript which also included the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;. The poems themselves appear to have been composed over a long period of time, from the time of Alexander the Great until the time that paganism gave way in the Roman Empire. They reflect the light-hearted elegance of much of Anacreon&#x27;s genuine works although they were not written in the same Ionic Greek dialect that Anacreon used. They also display literary references and styles more common to the time of their actual composition.

===A translated poem===
Typical of most efforts at translation, this 19th-century one by Walter Headlam takes the subject matter of Anacreon&#x27;s verses and works them into a rhyming style typical of the English poetry written in Headlam&#x27;s day. The subject of the poem still remains: Anacreon complaining that a young woman, whom he compares to a Thracian filly, does not recognize his amatory skills.
==Reception==
===Ancient===

Anacreon was already famous in his own lifetime, depicted on Athenian red-figure vase paintings while he was still alive. His writings influenced fifth-century Athenian drama, as tragedy adopted his metres, while several surviving comic fragments mention him, and Aristophanes included adaptations of Anacreon&#x27;s poems in his plays. Ancient philosophical and moralistic writers were divided on Anacreon, with some, such as Plato, portraying him as a wise man, while others condemned him for being too concerned with drunkenness and lust.

By the Hellenistic period, a caricature of Anacreon as drunken and lustful was established; the poems inspired by Anacreon known as the Anacreontea, composed between the first century BC and the sixth century AD, imitate him in both theme and metre, particularly his erotic and sympotic poetry, while avoiding themes present in Anacreon but which fall outside of the stereotype of him.

Anacreon was respected as a poet and included in the canon of nine lyric poets. The Hellenistic poet Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Lock of Berenice&quot; is an adaptation of a poem by Anacreon, Ovid and Propertius allude to him, and he was an important influence on Horace, who refers to him three times in his poetry and frequently alludes to his work.

===Modern===

The anacreontic meter continued to be used into the medieval period, though the direct influence of Anacreon is uncertain.
 The Anacreontea were the most important influence on Anacreon&#x27;s later reception, with the edition of Henricus Stephanus in 1554 initiating a trend for short and playful &quot;Anacreontic&quot; poetry. In the early modern period, Anacreon&#x27;s poetry was translated into Latin as well as into the vernacular, and poets started once again to adapt his works. The European Anacreontic movement reached its height in the eighteenth century, with Anacreontic groups in Germany, France, and Britain including the London Anacreontic Society (1772–1779).

In the visual arts, Anacreon was largely shown in a biographical or literary context: Raphael painted him in the company of Sappho in &quot;Parnassus&quot;, while a caricature by Honoré Daumier illustrates the ancient story that he choked to death on a grape seed. The ancient stereotype of Anacreon as the elderly, drunken poet of love was illustrated by Nicolas Poussin and Jean-Léon Gérôme.

<text>Yingge District () is a district located on the Dahan River in southwestern New Taipei City in northern Taiwan. It is famous for the production of porcelain and an abundance of art studios and shops.

==Name==

On the northern side of Yingge lies a formation that went by the names of (Parrot Stone), 石 (Eagle Brother Stone), and 哥石 (Golden oriole or Warbler Brother Stone). The last stone is where the current name of the district derives from. The modern name &quot;Yingge&quot; () literally means &quot;Warbler Song&quot; in Chinese.

According to legend, the rock formation produced a miasma that disoriented, sickened, and sometimes killed passers-by. One day, General Koxinga led his army past the rock. When they were caught in the miasma, he ordered his cannon to fire against the rock. When the neck of the stone eagle was broken, the miasma lifted and the troops could continue on their march.

==History==
According to legend, by 1684, the Yingge area already had Hakka migrants who specialized in cultivating tea. According to the locals, the history of ceramics in Yingge began 200 years ago when Wu An (吳鞍) immigrated from Guangzhou to Yingge to become the first potter in the area. Later, Chen Kun (陳昆), a brick maker, moved to the area and the two strived to make Yingge into the centre of Taiwan&#x27;s ceramics industry.

In 1920, Yingge Stone Village (鶯歌石庄) was renamed to Yingge Village (鶯歌庄). In 1940, the village was promoted to Yingge Street (鶯歌街), and in 1945 was changed to Yingge Small Town (鶯歌鎮). On August 1, 1946, seventeen urban villages () were divided from Yingge Township and made into Shulin Township. In 2010, Yingge Township was upgraded to Yingge District along with the upgrade of Taipei County. Today, Yingge is the largest centre for ceramic production in Taiwan, with over 800 ceramic-related businesses in the area.

<text>Linbian Township ( []; Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: &quot;Lìm-piên-hiông&quot;) is a rural township in western Pingtung County, Taiwan. It lies at the mouth of the Linbian River, facing the Taiwan Strait. It is known for its year-round warm climate, seafood restaurants and its wax apples (lembus).

==Names==
The area was called Pangsoya or Pangsoia during the Dutch era, and was later a small town called Pang-soh (). Early ethnic Chinese settlers called the area Nâ-á-piⁿ (, lit. &quot;wood&#x27;s edge&quot;). In 1920, the Japanese administration renamed the settlement , officially . In 1945, the Kuomintang regime retained the same Chinese characters which are read as &quot;Línbiān&quot; in Mandarin Chinese. However, the older Taiwanese pronunciation of &quot;Nâ-á-piⁿ&quot; continues to be commonly used.

==History==
In 1951, Nanzhou Township was separated from Linbian. 

==Geography==
* Area: 
* Population: 16,382 people (February 2024)

===Climate===
Like the rest of Southern Taiwan, Linbian is located within the tropics and has a tropical wet and dry climate. Due to its location, it is considered to be one of the warmest townships of Taiwan having the smallest temperature variations between seasons in the country (along with other various townships in Pingtung) because it is both located at a low latitude on the central Pingtung plains and also just above the Hengchun Peninsula which therefore does not share the peninsula&#x27;s temperate climate caused by its sea currents. The coldest month is January and the warmest month is July, with an average daily mean of 21°C (70°F) and 28°C (82°F) respectively. Although statistically the average highs during &quot;winter&quot; varies around 26°C (79°F), temperatures exceeding 29°C (84°F) during the afternoon are not uncommon even in January. 

Due to the warm and mostly windless weather, Linbian is famous for growing some of the best wax apples (lembus) in Taiwan, with one of the longest harvest seasons in the country, therefore it is nicknamed &quot;the wax apple township&quot; (蓮霧之鄉).

==Administrative divisions==
The township comprises 10 villages: Guanglin, Linbian, Qifeng, Renhe, Shuili, Tiancuo, Yongle, Zengan, Zhonglin and Zhulin.

<doc id="951039" wikidata="Q7886093" url="?curid=951039" title="Union Station (Pittsburgh)">
<text>Union Station, also known as Pennsylvania Station and commonly called Penn Station, is a historic train station in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was one of several passenger rail stations that served Pittsburgh during the 20th century; others included the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Station, the Baltimore and Ohio Station, and Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal, and it is the only surviving station in active use.

The historic station was designed by Chicago architect Daniel Burnham and built from 1898 to 1904. The station&#x27;s rotunda was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, followed by the entire building in 1976. In the 1980s, the Burnham station building was converted to apartment use, while Amtrak moved to an annex on the building&#x27;s east side.

== History ==
The current station replaced the original Union Station which was destroyed in the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877.

Unlike many union stations built in the U.S. to serve the needs of more than one railroad, this facility served only the Pennsylvania Railroad and its subsidiary lines. Thus, &quot;Union Station&quot; is a misnomer, for that reason, it was renamed in 1912 to match other Pennsylvania Stations. Other major passenger rail carriers served travelers at other stations. For instance, the New York Central used the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Station, the Wabash Railroad used Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad used both their own Baltimore and Ohio Station and the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie station.

The station building was designed by Chicago architect Daniel Burnham and built between 1898 and 1904. The materials were a grayish-brown terra cotta that looked like brownstone, and brick. Though Burnham is regarded more as a planner and organizer rather than a designer of details, which were left to draftsmen like Peter Joseph Weber, the most extraordinary feature of the monumental train station is its rotunda with corner pavilions. At street level, the rotunda sheltered turning spaces for carriages beneath wide, low vaulted spaces that owed little to any historicist style. Above, the rotunda sheltered passengers in a spectacular waiting room. Burnham&#x27;s firm completed more than a dozen projects in Pittsburgh, some on quite prominent sites. The rotunda is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Service began at the station on October 12, 1901.

On January 3, 1954, the Pennsylvania Railroad announced a in expansion and renovation for the complex. Into the beginning of the 1970s, the station remained a major stop for several of the PRR&#x27;s leading east–west trains: &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; (Chicago–New York), &quot;Manhattan Limited&quot; (Chicago–New York); &quot;Penn Texas&quot; (St. Louis–New York) and &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (St. Louis–New York).
By the late 1970s the Penn Central Corporation was accepting bids for the complex and it was purchased by the US General Services Administration. There were proposals in 1978 to make the structure into a federal office building, a new city hall, and a senior citizens apartment building. Amtrak proposed that the whole structure remain a train station and rail offices. In 1974, the County Council proposed having the station be the site of the then-planned David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The Buncher Development Company had an option to buy the property as late as 1984.

A $20 million restoration of Union Station began in 1986 to convert the office tower into apartments. It is now called the Pennsylvanian and opened to residents on May 23, 1988. The concourse, which is no longer open to the public, was transformed into a lobby for commercial spaces on the ground floor and the paint cleaned off the great central skylight. The rotunda is now closed to vehicular traffic; modern cars and trucks are too heavy for the brick road surface and risk caving in the roof to the parking garage below it.

=== Current passenger service ===
Union Station continues to serve as an active railway station, but through an annex on the Liberty Avenue side of the building. It is the western terminus of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; route and is along the &quot;Floridian&quot; route. Until 2005, Pittsburgh was also served by the &quot;Three Rivers&quot; (a replacement service for the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;), an extended version of the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; that terminated in Chicago. Its cancellation marked the first time in Pittsburgh&#x27;s railway history that the city was served by just two daily passenger trains.

== Architecture ==
In September 1978, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; art critic Brendan Gill proclaimed that Pittsburgh&#x27;s Penn Station is &quot;one of the great pieces of Beaux-Arts architecture in America...[one of the] symbols of the nation.&quot;
== Pittsburgh Regional Transit ==
=== Bus Rapid Transit ===
Penn Station is an at grade station operated by Pittsburgh Regional Transit. The station is located on the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway and is served by busway routes P1, P2, P7, P10, P12, P16, P17, P67, P68, P69, P71, P76 and P78.

East of the station is a bus layover area and the East Liberty Garage used by routes 1, 6, 11, 15, 19L, 29, 31, 39, 40, 44 and G31. These routes serve the Penn Station busway stops immediately before going out of service and are the first stops they make as they go into service. Routes 86, 87, 88 and 91 stop just outside of the station on Liberty and Penn Avenues.

=== Light Rail Transit ===
There is also a seldom used light rail station at the site. It opened in 1988 with regular shuttle service to Steel Plaza station, as well as two afternoon rush-hour trains on the 42S (now the Red Line). However, the station was difficult to integrate into other services, since it used a single-tracked former Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel. This tunnel travels beneath the US Steel Tower, and the building&#x27;s structural supports are on each side of the tunnel, prohibiting the installation of a second track. The shuttle service was discontinued in 1993, but the two 42S afternoon rush-hour trains continued to serve the station until 2007. Since 2007, the station has seen occasional use, mostly for charters or special events, such as part of the agency&#x27;s detoured transportation routes following Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011, as part of the &quot;Railvolution&quot; transit convention in October 2018, and during concrete repair work in the downtown tunnels between Steel Plaza and Gateway Station in March 2023.

Currently, there are plans to revive light rail service to Penn Station with the Brown Line.

<text>Qingshui District (), also spelled as Chingshui District, is a coastal suburban district in western Taichung City, Taiwan.

== Geography ==
Qingshui is located on the Qingshui Plain of Taiwan. It borders the Taiwan Strait to the west, the Dajia River to the north, and the Dadu Plateau to the east. Qingshui shares borders with Da&#x27;an, Dajia, and Waipu to the north, Shengang to the east, and Wuqi and Shalu to the south.

== History ==
The earliest evidence of humans living in this area is from 4000 years ago in the Neolithic Age. The archaeological site is preserved in the Niumatou Site. Before the influx of the Han Chinese, this area was known as &quot;Gomach&quot; (牛罵頭) by the Papora people.

In the Qing Dynasty, the Kangxi Emperor opened up the area for Chinese settlement. During this time, the area was known as &quot;Niumatou&quot;, which is an alternative pronunciation of &quot;Gomach&quot;. The two largest families that moved into this area were the Yang and the Tsai. Today, these two surnames remain as the most prominent surnames in Qingshui.

During Japanese Rule, the name was changed to &quot;Kiyomizu Town&quot; (清水街), which was administered under Taikō District, Taichu Prefecture.

After the Nationalists took over, the Japanese name was preserved but with the Chinese pronunciation &quot;Qingshui Township&quot;. It was located within Taichung County. In 2010, Taichung County was promoted into a special municipality, and Qingshui was promoted from a &quot;township&quot; to a &quot;district&quot;.
