<text>Hugh Macomber Ferriss (July 12, 1889 – January 28, 1962) was an American architect, illustrator, and poet. He was associated with exploring the psychological condition of modern urban life, a common cultural enquiry of the first decades of the twentieth century. After his death a colleague said he &#x27;influenced my generation of architects&#x27; more than any other man.&quot; Ferriss also influenced popular culture, for example Gotham City (the setting for Batman), Kerry Conran&#x27;s &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; and Rapture from &quot;BioShock&quot;.

==Early life==

Ferriss was born in 1889 and trained as an architect at Washington University in St. Louis. 

==Career==
Early in his career, Ferriss began to specialize in creating architectural renderings for other architects&#x27; work rather than designing buildings himself. As an architectural delineator, his task was to create a perspective drawing of a building or project. This was done either as part of the sales process for a project, or, more commonly, to advertise or promote the project to a wider audience. Thus, his drawings were frequently destined for annual shows or advertisements. As a result of this, his works were often published (rather than just given to the architect&#x27;s client), and Ferriss acquired a reputation. After he had set up as a free-lance artist, he found himself much sought after.

In 1912, Ferriss arrived in New York City and was soon employed as a delineator for Cass Gilbert. Some of his earliest drawings are of Gilbert&#x27;s Woolworth Building; they reveal that Ferriss&#x27;s illustrations had not yet developed his signature dark, moody appearance. In 1915, with Gilbert&#x27;s blessing, he left the firm and set up shop as an independent architectural delineator. In 1914, Ferriss married Dorothy Lapham, an editor and artist for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. 

By 1920, Ferriss had begun to develop his own style, frequently presenting the building at night, lit up by spotlights, or in a fog, as if photographed with a soft focus. The shadows cast by and on the building became almost as important as the revealed surfaces. His style elicited emotional responses from the viewer. His drawings were being regularly featured by such diverse publications as the &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. His writings also began to appear in various publications.

In 1916, New York City had passed landmark zoning laws that regulated and limited the massing of buildings according to a formula. The reason was to counteract the tendency for buildings to occupy the whole of their lot and go straight up as far as was possible. Since many architects were not sure exactly what these laws meant for their designs, in 1922 the skyscraper architect Harvey Wiley Corbett commissioned Ferriss to draw a series of four step-by-step perspectives demonstrating the architectural consequences of the zoning law. These four drawings would later be used in his 1929 book &quot;The Metropolis of Tomorrow&quot;. 
This book illustrated many conté crayon sketches of tall buildings. Some of the sketches were theoretical studies of possible setback variations within the 1916 zoning laws. Some were renderings for other architect&#x27;s skyscrapers. And at the end of the book was a sequence of views in Manhattan emerged in an almost Babylonian guise. His writing in the book betrayed an ambivalence to the rapid urbanization of America:

In 1955, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1960.

==Death and legacy==
Ferriss died in 1962. His archive, including drawings and papers, is held by the Drawings &amp; Archives Department of the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University. Every year, the American Society of Architectural Illustrators gives out the Hugh Ferriss Memorial Prize for architectural rendering excellence. The medal features Ferriss&#x27;s original &quot;Fourth Stage&quot; drawing, executed in bronze.

<doc id="948208" wikidata="Q3935980" url="?curid=948208" title="Ludlow Street">
<text>Ludlow Street runs between Houston and Division streets on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. Vehicular traffic runs south on this one-way street.

== Name ==
Ludlow Street was named after Lieutenant Augustus Ludlow, the naval officer who was second-in-command to Captain James Lawrence on the USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; during the ship’s engagement with HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; on June 1, 1813. It was to Ludlow that Lawrence said &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship.&quot;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The land that is now Ludlow Street was once part of the huge De Lancey Estate, which had been confiscated from James De Lancey after the Revolutionary War, due to his status as a Loyalist, and auctioned off. By the early 19th century, speculative builders had constructed decent housing for workers on Ludlow Street, as well as other streets nearby, such as Eldridge, Forsyth and Chrystie Streets. At mid-century, Ludlow was in the middle of &quot;Kleindeutschland&quot;, where large numbers of German-speaking immigrants had settled, and was one of the informal boundaries of the Jewish section of the neighborhood, along with Grand, Stanton, and Pitt Streets.

=== Art and music scene ===
As far back as 1962 &quot;Theatre of Eternal Music&quot; members Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise lived and worked at 56 Ludlow and in 1965 Lou Reed, John Cale and Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground lived and recorded there. The earliest known recorded version of &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; was recorded there. Other filmmakers, performers, poets, artists and musicians that lived in the building at the time included Warhol superstars Mario Montez and Jack Smith. Tony Conrad has produced two CDs from the Jack Smith tape archives subtitled &quot;56 Ludlow Street&quot; that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964. In the mid-1970s Gary Weis made some short films of Taylor Mead talking to his cat in the kitchen of his Ludlow Street apartment called &quot;Taylor Mead&#x27;s Cat&quot;. From 1980 to the mid-80s actor/videomaker Craig Calman lived in the building adjoining Taylor Mead&#x27;s. An excerpt from Tyler Hubby&#x27;s film &quot;Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present&quot; documents Tony Conrad making a field recording on Ludlow Street.

In the early 1980s, Ludlow Street was well known as a street where no wave Colab artists connected with ABC No Rio lived; such as Kiki Smith, Fab Five Freddy, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Tom Otterness, Wolfgang Staehle, Steven Parrino, Joseph Nechvatal, Peter Fend, Walter Robinson, Aline Mare, George Condo and art critic Carlo McCormick. In 1980, Coleen Fitzgibbon made a video called &quot;Ludlow&quot; about Ludlow Street. From 1983 to 1989, the bimonthly cassette publication Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine was based out of 143 Ludlow Street. Leonard Abrams started the East Village Eye cultural magazine at 167 Ludlow Street. In 1989 the Beastie Boys used a photo of the southwest corner of Ludlow and Rivington Street as the cover for their album &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;. The intersection was renamed “Beastie Boys Square” on September 9, 2023. In 2015, Mitch Corber created a short documentary video called &quot;Ludlow Street with Clayton&quot; that features Clayton Patterson walking down the street, discussing its cultural demise due to gentrification. Wolfgang Staehle presented an extended digital photographic record of Ludlow Street in his exhibition at Postmasters Gallery in 2016/2017. From 1995 to 2004 the performing and visual arts space was located at 145 Ludlow Street. In 2009, the School of Visual Arts established its Ludlow Residence at 101 Ludlow Street, which houses 350 art students. The notable music club Luna Lounge, an instrumental venue that help usher in what became a new millennial wave of guitar bands like The Strokes, Interpol and The National, was located at 171 Ludlow Street from 1993 until 2005.
=== Gentrification ===
By the end of the 1990s the street was dubbed &quot;Downtown&#x27;s Disneyland&quot; by New York Magazine and &quot;the New Bohemia&quot; by the New York Times.

In the 2000s, Ludlow Street was a destination street for musicians and music-lovers, and was heavily populated with fashion shops, art galleries, bars, restaurants, and performance venues such as Cake Shop, The Living Room, and Piano&#x27;s making Ludlow into a small nightlife strip with a distinct subcultural flavor. Local institutions included the bistro/cafe Pink Pony, the adjacent artist bar Max Fish, Katz&#x27;s Deli (one of the city&#x27;s most famous delicatessens) Motor City bar, Ludlow Street Guitars, Earthmatters Cafe (hangout of musicians/actors/writers/techies), Ludlow Studio (which was home to some of the top recording artists in the mid-1990s) and the Sombrero Mexican restaurant, better known to a generation of musicians as &quot;The Hat.&quot; The art and cultural gallery Ludlow 38 is the downtown satellite for contemporary art of the Goethe-Institut New York. The space was designed by artists Ethan Breckenridge and Liam Gillick. In 2005 artist Wolfgang Staehle created &quot;One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)&quot;. The work consists of 6716 images displayed in approximately 8 second intervals over 24 hours.

In 2013, Ludlow Street between Delancey and Houston Streets lost to rising rent many small interesting shops, bars and cafes that once gave the street its distinctive flavor. Closed were: Pink Pony Cafe Littéraire &amp; Ciné Club, the print shop at 139 Ludlow, Press Tea, Earth Matters natural food store and Motor City bar. However, Banksy installed a major street art installation on Ludlow Street in the fall of 2013 as part of his &quot;Better Out Than In&quot; residency: a strange vision of horses with camera-lens goggles rearing up by a car covered with cowering humans. The work is Banksy’s largest New York work to date.

<text>The Volkhov ( ; ; ) is a river in Novgorodsky and Chudovsky Districts of Novgorod Oblast and Kirishsky and Volkhovsky Districts of Leningrad Oblast in northwestern Russia. The Volkhov, which forms part of the basin of the Neva, is the only outflow of Lake Ilmen, and connects it with Lake Ladoga. The length of the Volkhov is , and the area of its drainage basin is . The city of Veliky Novgorod, the towns of Kirishi, Volkhov and Novaya Ladoga, and the historically important village of Staraya Ladoga are located along the Volkhov.

==Etymology==
A number of etymologies, none universally accepted, have been proposed for the name of the river. In his &quot;Etymological dictionary of the Russian language&quot;, Max Vasmer doubted some philologists&#x27; opinion that the river&#x27;s name is related to the Finnish &quot;velho&quot; (&quot;magician&quot;) or Russian &quot;volkhv&quot; (&quot;pagan priest&quot;).

==Geography==
The Volkhov flows out of Lake Ilmen north into Lake Ladoga, the largest lake in Europe. It is the second largest tributary of Lake Ladoga. It is navigable over its whole length. Discharge is highly variable depending primarily on the level of Lake Ilmen. The Volkhov is reported to reverse the direction of its flow in its upper section in exceptional circumstances. The river freezes up in late November, and breaks up in early April.

The level of water is regulated by the dam of the Volkhov hydroelectric plant (the first Soviet regional hydroelectric dam opened on December 19, 1926, in the framework of the GOELRO plan) situated 25 km upstream from the mouth of the river. Apart from hydroelectric generating purposes, the dam serves to facilitate navigation in the lower part of the river previously known for its rapids.

The upstream part of the Volkhov is connected to the Msta by the Siversov Canal (or Sievers Canal, named in honour of Baltic German statesman Jacob von Sievers) bypassing Lake Ilmen. The downstream part is connected with the Neva, the Syas, and the Svir by the Ladoga Canal bypassing Lake Ladoga.

The main tributaries of the Volkhov are the Vishera (right), joins the Maly Volkhovets armlet; the Kerest (left); the Oskuya (right); the Pchyovzha (right); the Tigoda (left); the Chyornaya (right); the Vloya (left); the Olomna (left).

The drainage basin of the Volkhov includes the large parts of Novgorod and Leningrad Oblasts, as well as areas in Tver Oblast, Pskov Oblast of Russia and Vitebsk Oblast of Belarus. The main rivers belonging to the river basin of the Volkhov are the Msta, the Lovat, the Pola, and the Shelon.

==History==

Despite its relatively small size, Volkhov has played a large role in Russian history and economy: in recognition of that, a figure representing the Volkhov appears among the allegorical monuments to the four major rivers of Russia (the others are: Volga, Dnieper and Neva) on the rostral columns in the ensemble of the Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and Rostral Columns. Its role in facilitating trade is due to its position as the only river penetrating deep into inland Russia that flows north towards the Baltic, rather than south towards the Caspian or Black Seas.

In the mid-9th century, the Volkhov was a heavily populated trade artery of the Varangian-dominated Rus&#x27; Khaganate. It was a vital part of the most important trade route connecting Northern Europe to the Orient, by way of the Volga (Volga trade route) and Dnieper (trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks). The ancient Russian capital Staraya Ladoga and one of the most significant Russian medieval cities Veliky Novgorod are located along the Volkhov. The river carried a significant portion of the trade between Novgorod and Western Europe.

After entering the Volkhov near Gorchakovshchina and Lyubsha, commercial vessels of the Vikings cast anchor at the major trade emporium of Aldeigja (Ladoga). Then they rowed upstream past a series of rapids, guarded by the fortified settlements at Novye Duboviki and Gorodishche. There was another outpost at Kholopy Gorodok, 13 km north of present-day Velikiy Novgorod, or rather Holmgard, which was founded near the point where the Volkhov flows from Lake Ilmen.

&quot;Most of these were initially small sites, probably not much more than stations for re-fitting and resupply, providing an opportunity for exchange and the redistribution of items passing along the river and caravan routes&quot;. It seems on the whole likely that such pre-urban settlements gave the country its Norse name of &quot;Gardariki&quot;.

During World War II, the stretch of the Volkhov north of Veliky Novgorod separated Soviet (right bank) and German (left bank) troops between 1941 and 1944. German soldiers built extensive &quot;underground cities&quot; along the battlefront. Local birch was used for constructing shelters and hundreds of miles of corduroy road in the swampland. Buildings were on slopes to allow for drainage. &quot;Six or eight men occupy each hut and there are also underground stables and storage places for coal and supplies.&quot;

==Transportation==
The entire Volkhov River is navigable; however, there is no passenger navigation.

As with other navigable rivers, the navigability of the Volkhov makes it possible to transport bulky pieces of equipment which are inconvenient to ship by rail or road due to their size. In 2015, the Volkhov was part of a route of a river barge transporting a VVER-1200 nuclear reactor vessel from the Atommash plant in Volgodonsk. After being moved by the barge up the Volkhov to Novgorod, the reactor was taken across the city to the train station, and then shipped by a special rail car to Belarus.

<text>Amir Hushang Ebtehaj (; 25 February 1928 – 10 August 2022), also known by his pen name H. E. Sayeh (, lit. &quot;Shadow&quot;), was an Iranian poet of the 20th century, whose life and work spans many of Iran&#x27;s political, cultural and literary upheavals.

==Life==
Ebtehaj was born 25 February 1928 in Rasht in a prominent Baháʼí family in Iran and had his primary schooling there before moving to Tehran. His first book of poetry, with an introduction by eminent poet Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi, was published when he was 19 years old. During Iran&#x27;s open period following World War II, Sayeh got involved in various literary circles and contributed to various literary magazines such as Sokhan, Kavian, Sadaf, Maslehat, and others. Unlike many other literary figures of the time who got deeply involved in politics and left-leaning activities, Sayeh stayed true to his social and political consciousness but refrained from deeper involvement. He was employed at the National Cement Company for 22 years while continuing his literary activities. Later he was invited by the National Iranian Radio to produce the traditional music program 
Golhaye Taze and &quot;Golchin Hafte.&quot; 

After the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the ensuing suppression, Sayeh spent a year in prison for his writings. After he was released, he began to work on &quot;Hafez, by Sayeh,&quot; a verse-for-verse study of the various publications of Hafez. In 1987, he moved to Cologne, Germany, with his family and lived there, but he visited Iran several times a year.

Sayeh died from kidney failure at his home in Cologne on 10 August 2022 at the age of 94.

==Poetry==
Sayeh published his first poetry collection while still a high school student in the northern province of Gilan, Iran. His total output, however, remains small because of his preoccupation with increased craftsmanship and exact phraseology. In the political climate of the 1940s, Sayeh was an ardent advocate of the poetry of social commitment. His early poetry reveals his concern with purposive literature. 

Sayeh has also written a collection of lyrical poems (ghazal) in the classical style. Here, he reveals an easy mastery of traditional forms—the lyrical ode, in particular—which he uses to celebrate both the sacred and the secular moments of life. Sayeh&#x27;s poetry, at times highly emotional, is always remarkable for its convincing directness and unconcealed sentiment.
A number of his lyric poems, ballads and poems have been performed by famous Iranian singers such as Mohammad Reza Shajarian, Alireza Eftekhari, Shahram Nazeri, Hossein Ghavami and Mohammad Esfahani.

<text>USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot; (SSN-707) is a decommissioned . She was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Portsmouth, New Hampshire. 

== History ==
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 10 December 1973 and her keel was laid down on 8 May 1980. She was launched on 18 September 1982 sponsored by Mrs. Helen Poe Goodrich, and commissioned on 1 October 1983, with Commander Donald M. Olson in command. The ceremony took place at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, just east of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, her namesake city.

Three weeks after commissioning &quot;Portsmouth&quot; began her first mission, supporting rescue operations in Grenada. She was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for that action.

In 1984 &quot;Portsmouth&quot; entered her homeport of Groton, Connecticut, which she left for her permanent homeport at Ballast Point Submarine Base in San Diego. En route she transited through the Panama Canal and made a quick dash south for her first transit across the equator. 
In 1985 &quot;Portsmouth&quot; commenced her first Western Pacific operations that included port-calls in Japan and Australia and became the first American nuclear-powered warship to visit Fiji. Years later she became the first to make a liberty call to communist Chinese reunified Hong Kong.

On 10 September 2004 &quot;Portsmouth&quot; was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia and was inactivated at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in nearby Portsmouth, Virginia, her other namesake city. She entered the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. While the submarine was only halfway through her design lifespan, her reactor core required refueling. Decommissioning was chosen as a cost-saving measure.

== Awards ==
The ship deployed to 5th Fleet with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Battle Group in 1995–1996. She was awarded the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) and the COMSUBRON 11 Battle &quot;E&quot;.

The ship deployed to 7th Fleet in 1997. The crew was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal. Upon return to homeport, the ship was again awarded the COMSUBRON 11 Battle &quot;E&quot;, judged the most battle effective submarine in her squadron.

<doc id="948223" wikidata="Q1951422" url="?curid=948223" title="Mr. Destiny">
<text>Mr. Destiny is a 1990 American fantasy comedy film directed by James Orr, and starring James Belushi, Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Courteney Cox, Jay O. Sanders and Rene Russo. It is heavily inspired by the 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

In the film, a man in his 30s blames most of his life&#x27;s problems on his failure in a baseball game during his adolescence. His guardian angel grants him the wish to see that failure corrected. The man is transported to an alternative reality where he has had a more successful career and a more powerful position. The price is that he has lost his loved ones from his previous life and has multiple new enemies.

==Plot==
The story begins on &quot;the strangest day&quot; of Larry Burrows&#x27;s life (his 35th birthday) consisting of a series of comic and dramatic misadventures. Larry blames his life&#x27;s problems on having struck out during a key moment of his state high school baseball championship game on his 15th birthday. When he wishes he had done things differently, his wish is granted by a guardian angel-like figure named Mike, who intermittently appears as a bartender, a cab driver, and so on. Larry soon discovers that Mike has transferred him into an alternative reality in which he had won the pivotal high school game. He finds himself still working for the company he had been originally, albeit successful and in a powerful position, and married to the boss&#x27;s sexy daughter Cindy Jo Bumpers. At first, his new life seems perfect, but he soon begins to miss his best friend Clip Metzler, and his wife Ellen from his previous life; he also discovers that his alternative self has created many enemies, like Jewel Jagger who was a forklift operator and now she is his secretary and lover.

The story begins with Larry&#x27;s car, an old Ford LTD station wagon, stalled out in a dark alley. Suddenly the pink lights of The Universal Joint, a bar, come on. Larry goes inside to call a tow truck and tells bartender Mike his troubles. He reviews the day he just had, which ended with his getting fired after discovering his department head Niles Pender&#x27;s scheme to sell the company under the nose of its owners to a group of naive Japanese investors. He tells Mike that he wishes he had hit that last pitch out of the park, after which Mike fixes him a drink called &quot;The Spilt Milk&quot;. The Spilt Milk was a drink that gave him his wish that he hit that home run in that championship game.

Larry leaves the bar, walks home (his car apparently towed), and discovers someone else living in his house, which is now fixed up (previously his yard and driveway were muddy and unfinished). Mike appears as a cab driver and drives him to his &quot;new&quot; home, a mansion in Forest Hills, explaining that he did in fact hit the last pitch and won the game. He soon discovers that Cindy Jo is his wife and he&#x27;s the president of his company, Liberty Republic Sporting Goods. Being a classic car buff, he&#x27;s shocked to find that he owns a collection of priceless antique automobiles.

Larry soon discovers that Clip has a low-level job in the accounting department and is quite insecure as opposed to the joker he previously was. Ellen is a shop steward (in both realities) and is married to another man. Jewel, a forklift operator in the previous reality, is now Larry&#x27;s mistress and his secretary. Ellen hates Larry, and he discovers that the union is threatening a walkout due to massive layoffs and increased production since Niles is selling Liberty Republic in both realities. Seeing Ellen, he realizes how much he misses her and agrees to all the union&#x27;s demands, provided Ellen agrees to dinner at his favorite restaurant. She reluctantly agrees, and Larry eventually convinces her that they were married in a previous life.

After discovering that Larry has agreed to union demands, Niles takes revenge by telling both Cindy Jo and Jewel of Larry&#x27;s dinner date with Ellen. He then plots to kill Larry at the office that night. However, company owner Leo Hansen arrives to deliver a note to Larry, announcing his termination at Cindy Jo&#x27;s request, and Niles kills him by mistake. Discovering the note, Niles calls the police, who attempt to arrest Larry for Leo&#x27;s murder. Larry escapes while jealous Jewel creates pandemonium outside in her attempts to shoot him (and shoots out several police cars in the process), leading to a police chase. Larry is eventually cornered in a dark alley, but the pink glow of &quot;The Universal Joint&quot; comes on and he runs into the bar. Unable to find Mike, Larry attempts to make the &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; himself, the ingredients clearly aged.

What appears to be flashing police car lights appear and Larry surrenders. However, it is a tow truck driven by Duncan. Confused at first, Larry sees Mike back behind the bar and realizes he has been returned to his old life. Larry thanks Mike for everything and, upon exiting the bar, suddenly realizes that the deal with the Japanese investors is happening shortly. Driven by Duncan to company headquarters, Larry barges into the boardroom, decks Niles, and exposes his scheme just as Leo is about to sign the deal.

Thinking everyone forgot his birthday, Larry returns home (which still has the muddy driveway and lawn) to a surprise party with his family and friends. Soon after, Cindy Jo and her husband Jackie Earle, the company president, arrive. Jackie offers Niles&#x27; job to Larry, plus a company car which is a new Mercedes, and Larry accepts.

In the past, young Larry is about to leave the stadium, still upset about the loss, when he is greeted by a mysterious stranger in the stands (Mike) who reassures him that everything will be all right. Larry thanks him for the reassurance but walks off wondering who Mike thinks he is kidding.

==Deleted scenes==
The film has at least two scenes that were removed from the final cut, both featuring Michael Caine; one in the garage at LJ&#x27;s mansion and another where Caine&#x27;s character appears to LJ when he escapes Ellen&#x27;s dog while spying on her at her house.

<doc id="948247" wikidata="Q7197210" url="?curid=948247" title="Pipe Creek Sinkhole">
<text>The Pipe Creek Sinkhole near Swayzee in Grant County, Indiana, is one of the most important paleontological sites in the interior of the eastern half of North America. It is preserved because it was buried by glacial till. Uncovered in 1996 by workers at the Pipe Creek Junior limestone quarry, the sinkhole has yielded a diverse array of fossils from the Pliocene epoch, dating back five million years. Discoveries have been made there of the remains of camelids, bears, beavers, frogs, snakes, turtles, and several previously unknown species of rodents. Two fish taxa, bullhead (&quot;Ameiurus&quot;) and sunfish (&quot;Centrarchidae&quot;), have also been found there.

==Origin and importance==
The Pipe Creek Sinkhole preserves an ancient wetland. It was created by the collapse of a limestone cave in a Silurian reef formation. That left a steep-sided depression about long, wide and deep. When water collected in the depression, it became the habitat of the plants and animals whose remains were preserved there when the sinkhole was buried by glacial outwash and till during the Pleistocene Epoch, two million to 11,000 years ago.

While the ecology of the Pliocene in North America is well-known from fossil discoveries in other places, notably coastal sites, the Pleistocene glaciers destroyed or scattered most of the fossil remains in the continent&#x27;s interior. The Pipe Creek Sinkhole, however, was &quot;buried&quot; by the glaciers and the debris they left, making it the only known Pliocene example in the central part of the eastern half of the continent.

==The sinkhole&#x27;s ecology==
The ancient wetland was home to a large and dense plant and animal population that includes both extinct and extant forms. The climate was warm and temperate, but somewhat dry, possibly supporting a grassland-forest transitional zone. The preserved vertebrate fauna are dominated by aquatic species, particularly leopard frogs, which are still common throughout the United States. Mammalian finds include an early rhinoceros (&quot;Teleoceras&quot;, possibly from the Miocene epoch), canids, peccaries and short-faced bear.

Backed by a grant from the National Science Foundation, researchers from the Indiana State Museum and several universities substantially completed field work at the sinkhole in the summer of 2004, but there was about one weeklong dig a year from 2005 to 2011. What probably was the last work at the site took place in 2014, with scientists and volunteers screening soil previously removed from the sinkhole.

<text>Eugene Pleasants Odum (September 17, 1913 – August 10, 2002) was an American biologist at the University of Georgia known for his pioneering work on ecosystem ecology. He and his brother Howard T. Odum wrote the popular ecology textbook, &quot;Fundamentals of Ecology&quot; (1953). The Odum School of Ecology is named in his honor.

== Biography ==
Son of the sociologist Howard W. Odum, and older brother of the ecologist Howard T. Odum, E.P. Odum credited his father for imparting a holistic approach to exploring subjects. When contemplating where to conduct his advanced graduate work, he rejected both the University of Michigan and Cornell University, as he did not feel that this holism was embodied in their approach to their biology departments.

Instead, he chose the Graduate Department of Zoology at the University of Illinois, where he earned his doctorate degree. There Odum was a student of Victor Shelford, whose efforts led to the establishment of The Nature Conservancy.

After getting his Ph.D. in 1939, Odum was hired to be the first resident biologist at the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station, in Rensselaerville, New York. The 430-acre preserve had been founded in 1931 and its research station established in 1938. The Preserve’s first summer research fellows, also selected in 1939, were Edward C. Raney and Donald Griffin. Raney, who had just finished his Ph.D. at Cornell, studied green frogs and bullfrogs; he went on to become a leading ichthyologist (zoologist who studies fish). Griffin, who was completing his Ph.D. at Harvard, did research on bat echolocation (he later became famous for that work).

==Marriage and family==
Odum and Martha Ann Huff, whom he had met as a student, married at her home in Wilmette, Illinois, on November 18, 1939. She continued her work as an artist. Odum was very proud of Martha&#x27;s accomplishments as an artist. She often painted landscapes when traveling with her husband across the US and overseas. 
Martha Ann Odum joined her husband in Rensselaerville, where he continued to work at the Huyck Preserve. His research included studying chickadees and—more important for his future as an ecologist—inventorying the plants and preparing a habitat map. His purpose was to establish a basis for succession studies of the land so man could plan and manage ecosystems. He and Martha had two sons, William Eugene and Daniel Thomas Odum. Their son William died in 1991 at the age of 48, but had already made important contributions to science while a faculty member at the University of Virginia. In 1995 a paper attributed to William E. Odum, together with his father and uncle, suggested the paradigm of pulsed ecosystems.

==Academic career at University of Georgia==
In September 1940, Odum took a job as an instructor of biology at the University of Georgia (Athens, Georgia). In the late 1940s, while serving on the University&#x27;s biology faculty committee, which was then drawing up a new curriculum, he concluded there was an urgent need to incorporate the subject of ecology, since he learned that his colleagues generally did not know what ecology (in its own right) might be. He founded the Institute of Ecology, later named for him.

In 2007 the Institute of Ecology, which Odum founded at the University of Georgia, was named as the Odum School of Ecology, the first stand-alone academic unit of a research university dedicated to ecology. Odum also founded two field research stations as a faculty member at the University of Georgia: the University of Georgia Marine Institute and the Savannah River Ecology Lab.

== Work ==

=== Ecosystems ===
In the 1940s and 1950s, &quot;ecology&quot; was not yet a field of study that had been defined as a separate discipline. Even professional biologists seemed to Odum to be generally under-educated about how the Earth&#x27;s ecological systems interact with one another. Odum brought forward the importance of ecology as a discipline that should be a fundamental dimension of the training of a biologist.

Odum adopted and developed further the term &quot;ecosystem&quot;. Although sometimes said to have been coined by Raymond Lindeman in 1942, the term &quot;ecosystem&quot; first appeared in a 1935 publication by the British ecologist, Arthur Tansley, and had in 1930 been coined by Tansley&#x27;s colleague, Arthur Roy Clapham. Before Odum, the ecology of specific organisms and environments had been studied on a more limited scale within individual sub-disciplines of biology. Many scientists doubted that it could be studied on a large scale, or as a discipline in itself.

Odum wrote a textbook on ecology with his brother, Howard Thomas Odum, a graduate student at Yale. The Odum brothers&#x27; book (first edition, 1953), &quot;Fundamentals of Ecology&quot;, was the only textbook in the field for about ten years. Among other things, the Odums explored how one natural system can interact with another.

=== Environmentalism ===
While Odum did wish to influence the knowledge base and thinking of fellow biologists and of college and university students, his historical role was not as a promoter of public environmentalism as we now know it. However, his dedication in his 1963 book, &quot;Ecology&quot;, expressed that his father had inspired him to &quot;seek more harmonious relationships between man and nature&quot;.

By 1970, when the first Earth Day was organized, Odum&#x27;s conception of the living Earth as a global set of interlaced ecosystems became one of the key insights of the environmental movement that has since spread through the world. He was, however, an independent thinker who was at times, gently critical of the slogans and fashionable concepts of the environmentalist movement.

=== Legacy ===
Odum&#x27;s will stipulated that, after his death, his on the Middle Oconee River in Athens, Ga. would be sold and developed according to plans he laid out before his death. He would often show friends and colleagues hand sketched plans for his vision of this green community. Plans included that over 50 percent of the property would be protected greenspace and walking trails, managed by the Oconee River Land Trust. Profits from the sale of the land would go to the Eugene and William Odum Ecology Fund, after $1 million is set aside for a professorial chair at UGA in Odum&#x27;s name. The land was sold to builder John Willis Homes who is honoring Odum’s wishes at Beech Creek Preserve.

Odum&#x27;s financial contributions were focused on not only the University of Georgia, but also the University of Virginia given his son&#x27;s faculty appointment there, and the University of North Carolina where his father was a prolific scholar. Ultimately, his wealth—partly the product of book royalties—benefited those institutions that he respected. The Ecological Society of America offers the Eugene P. Odum Award for Excellence in Ecology Education, which was endowed by, and named for, Odum.

<text>Starodub (, , ) is a town in Bryansk Oblast, Russia, on the Babinets River in the Dnieper basin, southwest of Bryansk. Population: 16,000 (1975).

==History==

Starodub has been known since the 11th century, when it was a part of the Principality of Chernigov. It was plundered by the Cumans in 1080. It was burned to the ground by the Mongols in the 13th century.

It became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 14th century (soon part of the Polish–Lithuanian union), and Grand Duke Algirdas rebuilt it as a defensive stronghold against Muscovites and Tatars. In 1408, it was granted to Duke Švitrigaila. In 1503, it passed to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1535, it was besieged and captured by Polish-Lithuanian forces and the defenders were executed however, it soon fell back to Muscovy. In 1616, it was recaptured by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, within which it became a county seat in the Smolensk Voivodeship. During the Smolensk War, in 1632, it was captured by Russia, however, it was restored to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1634. In 1648, during the Khmelnytskyi Uprising, Zaporozhian Cossacks seized the town, and 188 families of local Ruthenian nobility recognized the Cossack hetman as a new governor, within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, after which the Ukrainians staged a anti-Jewish pogrom. In 1654, it passed to Russia, confirmed in 1686. In 1660, the town was ravaged by Tatars, and in 1663 it was attacked by the Poles. Starodub became the center of Starodub Cossack Regiment and enjoyed a large measure of autonomy between 1666 and 1686. In 1677 the town suffered a fire.

Starodub remained rudiments of Cossack Hetmanate&#x27;s administrative division until 1782 when it became an uyezd town. In 1796, Starodub was incorporated into Chernigov Governorate. In 1867, Starodub had a population of 12,042. In 1870, there were ten factories, including nine tanneries. Four annual fairs were held. In 1918, the town was occupied by the Germans and the town was part of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. The Soviet authority was instated in November 1918.
During the Soviet period, Starodub was a part of Gomel Governorate (1919–1926), Bryansk Governorate (1926–1929), Western Oblast (1929–1937), and Oryol Oblast (1937–1944). The town was once again occupied by the Germans between August 18, 1941 and September 22, 1943. The Germans operated a Nazi prison and a forced labour battalion for Jews in the town. Starodub finally became a part of Bryansk Oblast in 1944.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Starodub serves as the administrative center of Starodubsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Starodubsky Urban Administrative Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Starodubsky Urban Administrative Okrug is incorporated as Starodub Urban Okrug.

Prior to January 1, 2013, Starodub was administratively incorporated as a town of district significance within Starodubsky District.

==Architecture==
As a significant center of the Cossack Hetmanate, Starodub is the only place in Russia where authentic examples of Ukrainian Baroque may be seen. The Nativity Cathedral, built in 1617 and overhauled after a conflagration in 1677, is a typical example of Cossack Baroque. The Epiphany Church goes back to 1789, while the Church of St. Nicholas was erected in the Neoclassical style in 1802.

==Notable people==
* Alexandra Ramm-Pfemfert (1883–1963), translator
* Uri Nissan Gnessin (1879–1913), writer
* Menahem Gnessin (1882–1951), actor
* Pavlo Skoropadskyi (1873–1945), Hetman of Ukraine, went to school in Starodub
* Ivan Skoropadskyi (1646–1722), Zaporizhian Hetman, was at one point stationed in the town, when he was colonel of the Starodub Cossack regiment

<text>90 West Street (previously known as the West Street Building and the Brady Building) is a 23-story residential building in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. Located on West Street just south of the World Trade Center, the building was designed by Cass Gilbert, with Gunvald Aus and Burt Harrison as structural engineers, and John Peirce as general contractor. It was erected for the West Street Improvement Corporation, led by transportation magnate Howard Carroll.

The Gothic styling and ornamentation of 90 West Street served to emphasize its height. The design combined elements of the three-section &quot;classical column&quot; arrangement of 19th-century buildings with the &quot;romantic tower&quot; of Gilbert&#x27;s later structures such as the Woolworth Building. Its waterfront site necessitated the installation of pilings deep into the ground. Other features included a terracotta facade with granite at the two-story base, as well as terracotta fireproofing inside the building. The building&#x27;s design was widely praised when it was originally completed. The building is a New York City designated landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

90 West Street was built in 1905–1907 as an office building called the West Street Building. &quot;The Garret Restaurant&quot;, on the structure&#x27;s top floors, was marketed as the highest restaurant in the world. The building underwent numerous ownership changes in the 20th century, and was known after its long-term owner, Brady Security and Realty Corporation, during the middle of the century. Following the collapse of the adjacent World Trade Center in the September 11, 2001, attacks, the West Street Building was severely damaged. The building was subsequently extensively refurbished and it reopened as a residential building called 90 West in 2005.

== Site ==
90 West Street is located on a plot facing West Street to the west, Cedar Street and the World Trade Center to the north, and Albany Street to the south. The lot is roughly parallelogram-shaped. The building shares its block with 130 Cedar Street, a 19-story hotel. The building carries the address numbers 87–95 West Street, inclusive, as well as odd address numbers 21–25 Albany Street and even address numbers 136–140 Cedar Street.

When built, the West Street Building overlooked the North River (now Hudson River) to the west. Until the construction of the World Trade Center in the 1970s, the West Street Building was one of the tallest buildings on Lower Manhattan&#x27;s Hudson River shoreline. By the 1980s, Battery Park City was built on filled land along the shore of the river, cutting off the West Street Building from a view of the waterfront.

== Architecture ==
The West Street Building is tall and contains 23 above-ground floors. It was designed by Cass Gilbert, who had designed numerous public structures and government buildings in the Beaux Arts style. From the start, Gilbert intended the West Street Building as &quot;a machine that makes the land pay&quot;. In an article for the &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot;, he wrote that in general, &quot;architectural beauty, judged even from an economic standpoint, has an income-bearing value&quot;.

The West Street Building was one of the first skyscrapers to consistently use neo-Gothic-style decoration. At the time, it was still relatively rare for a steel-skeleton skyscraper to contain terracotta cladding, as the West Street Building did. The decoration was inspired by the Gothic architecture of Belgium, using religious models such as the St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral in Mechelen, as well as secular models such as Brussels Town Hall. Furthermore, in his initial plans, Gilbert wanted to create a five-story tower that rose from the center of the structure, topping the height of the Flatiron Building. This five-story tower was canceled by Carroll, presumably to save money, but the idea inspired the seven-story upper section of the building, topped by a mansard roof.

=== Form and facade ===
At the time of the West Street Building&#x27;s construction, the facades of many 19th-century early skyscrapers consisted of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. This contrasted with Gilbert&#x27;s later skyscraper designs, which tended toward a &quot;romantic tower&quot; style. The West Street Building was one of four important Gilbert skyscrapers in the early 20th century, the others being the Second Brazer Building (1896), the Broadway–Chambers Building (1900), and the Woolworth Building (1913). The West Street Building used a reduced version of the facade layout; compared to previous commissions, the &quot;base&quot; was scaled down, the shaft was emphasized by tall vertical piers, and the capital was emphasized by its Gothic-style mansard roof.

The West Street Building contains a base clad with granite. On the upper stories, the facade consists mostly of beige terracotta tiles manufactured by the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company. The terracotta facade is highlighted by red, green, blue, and gold tiles. To comply with the building laws of the 1900s, which required buildings over to be able to withstand of wind pressure, the West Street Building&#x27;s steel superstructure was braced to protect against wind gusts. The curtain walls on the exterior were reinforced by hollow brick, while portal bracing was used for the steel frame.

The lower floors occupy the whole parallelogram-shaped lot, while the upper floors contain a C-shaped floor plan, with a small &quot;light court&quot; facing east toward the middle of the block. There are seven bays on the Cedar Street elevation, nine bays along West Street, and six bays on Albany Street. The upper portion of the eastern elevation is divided by the light court into two wings: the northern wing contains four bays and the southern wing contains two bays. The eastern elevation is mostly concealed from view, but the visible portions contain a similar design treatment to the three other elevations.

==== Base ====

The base is three stories tall and clad with Fox Island granite. There are segmental arches at ground level, and a cornice runs above the second story. At West Street, there are single-width arches within the outermost bays and double-width arches in all the other bays. The center bay consists of a double-height arched entrance flanked by red marble columns, bosses with tracery, and a sign saying . The Albany and Cedar Street facades are largely set up similarly at the base, with single-width arches in the outer bays and double-width arches in the inner bays. The Cedar Street side has an offset arched entrance that is similar to the West Street entrance, with signage saying , while the Albany Street side has a driveway that leads down into a basement garage. On all three sides, the remaining arches are double-height and contain wood, aluminum, or cast-iron storefronts.

The third story is designed as a transitional story with a cornice above the top. Between the window openings in each bay, there are granite panels, as well as foliated bosses at each corner of the window openings. The outermost bays contain one window each and are framed by more elaborate surrounds, while all the other bays contain two windows each. There are marble panels below the cornice, and single-story engaged columns at each corner of the building. Some of the granite lintels are spalled because they had been burned in the September 11 attacks.

==== Upper stories ====
The shaft comprises the fourth through sixteenth stories. As with the base, the outer window bays consist of one window per floor, and the inner bays contain two windows per floor. Between each floor are terracotta spandrels, which are recessed behind the piers. Each bay is separated by three-quarter piers that rise from the fourth to the fifteenth stories. There are iron balconies on the 14th floor. At the 15th floor, the piers end in foliated capitals, and the tops of the windows end in elaborate arches. The 16th floor serves as another &quot;transitional story&quot; and its windows are surrounded by complex ornamentation. A cornice runs above the 16th floor.
The crown comprises the 17th through 20th floors. The 17th through 19th floors are designed as a triple-height arcade. The spandrels between the floors are decorated with multicolored floral motifs, while there is another ornate cornice above the 19th floor. On the 20th floor, there are groupings of two windows in the outer bays and three windows in the inner bays, with an elaborate colonette. There are figures of griffins separating each window bay.

The top three stories consist of a copper-clad mansard roof. There are dormer screens containing small balconies on the 21st floor, while the 22nd and 23rd floors contain dormer windows. These windows are covered by polygonal dormer roofs. Above the 23rd floor is an asphalt roof surface containing mechanical equipment as well as bulkheads. The dormers, as well as decorative tourelles, added to the aesthetic of the building when it was originally viewed from the waterfront.

=== Foundation ===
The site was difficult to develop, as the bedrock layer was an average of below the ground level of the site. The ground above the bedrock was composed of of clay directly above, then a layer of sand, and finally of mud and silt at ground level. Construction was further hindered by the difficulties in constructing caissons due to the frequent fires and air-pressure-related injuries associated with such structures. Gunvald Aus, the structural engineer, dismissed the original plans for the foundation, which called for the usage of pneumatic caissons so that the foundation would be deep inside the rock. Instead, he decided to use pilings because he felt that it was sufficient for the layers of rock and hardpan to be immediately adjacent. Pilings had been previously used in two other Lower Manhattan buildings: the New York Produce Exchange and the Havemeyer Building.

The foundation consisted of pilings that descended at least , except at the boiler room where they descended . A layer of concrete, approximately thick, was then placed atop the pilings. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the underwriter for general contractor John Peirce, initially did not insure the project because of concerns that the foundation would settle unevenly. Metropolitan Life finally agreed to insure the project after Aus performed a test, which found that a pile would settle when loaded with of pig iron.

Seventy-four columns were drilled down to the rock. Due to the varying loads carried by each column, their sizes ranged from square, composed of clusters of between 4 and 25 piles. Additionally, in the layer of concrete above the piles, there was a series of I-beams that was encased in the concrete. Since the boundaries of the lot did not intersect at right angles, the columns carried varying weight distributions. The foundation work proceeded at an average depth of below the Hudson River&#x27;s mean high water, requiring extensive waterproofing. This contract was outsourced to the Sicilian Asphalt Paving Company, one of Carroll&#x27;s companies.

=== Features ===
The lobby contains two corridors arranged in a &quot;T&quot; shape. One leads south from the Cedar Street entrance while the other extends east from the main entrance on West Street, terminating at the north–south corridor. A mailroom is located on the southern side of the lobby section leading from Cedar Street, while a concierge desk is located on the southern side of the section from West Street. Within the lobby, there are now-closed arches leading to the ground-floor retail spaces. The retail areas themselves were configured with entrances to the street and to the lobby, but did not have interior partitions. As built, there were nine &quot;plunger elevators&quot;, five of which could operate at the same time. All elevators served the upper stories. The upper floors contained of leasable office space, with an average of per floor. The floors could be arranged to allow a myriad of office layouts. The National Fireproofing Company manufactured the interior terracotta fireproofing.

Following a 2005 renovation, the building has five elevators on the east wall of the lobby, opposite the West Street entrance, and are arranged in an arc. The renovation added a floor made of marble tile as well as plaster groin vaults on the ceiling. While the retail spaces&#x27; original finishes were burned and removed after the September 11 attacks, they received new concrete floors and gypsum ceilings and wall panels during the 2005 renovation. Furthermore, the offices were converted into residential apartments, and gypsum paneling was installed on the walls. A fitness center was installed at the bottom of the light court on the second floor.

The West Street Building&#x27;s small footprint and waterside location meant that there was little room for the building&#x27;s mechanical equipment, the layout of which had been designed mostly by Burt Harrison. On one basement level, there were four boilers, six power generators, elevator equipment, and rooms in which of coal could be stored. Radiators were placed underneath each window, with heat provided by a system of low-pressure exhaust pipes, since the site could be subject to heat losses on windy days. Originally, there was no artificial ventilation except in part of the basement.

== History ==

=== Development ===

The formation of the City of Greater New York in 1898 resulted in a sharp increase in the number of buildings being erected in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, and by the first decade of the 20th century, the neighborhood had forty new office buildings. These included the United States Express Building (2 Rector Street), the Singer Building, and the Old New York Evening Post Building, which were under construction in the middle of that decade. Among the interested developers was the West Street Improvement Company, a collection of businesspersons in Lower Manhattan. The company, headquartered in the Broadway–Chambers Building, was led by Howard Carroll and co-founded by John Peirce, Walter Roberts, and Judge S. P. McConnell.

The West Street Improvement Company sought to erect an office structure particularly for the shipping interests along the Hudson River, the shoreline of which was located at West Street during the early 1900s. They selected a site between Albany and Cedar Streets with a lot length of facing West Street. The adjacent buildings on West Street contained warehouses and other facilities dedicated toward the railroad and steamship industries. Furthermore, the future site of the West Street Building was directly across West Street from ferry piers and docks, which in turn led to major ferry and rail terminals on the other side of the Hudson River.

Carroll hired Gilbert to create a design in April 1905. Gunvald Aus and Burt Harrison were commissioned as the structural engineers while John Peirce was retained as the general contractor. The same year, the West Street Improvement Company and Gilbert submitted documents to the New York City Department of Buildings, proposing a 23-to-28 story office building that would cost about $2 million to build. Architecture professor Sharon Irish identified &quot;fourteen preliminary sketches that include plans, elevations, and perspectives&quot; for the building, varying in their level of detail. The design had to attract the more than 100,000 ferry passengers that traveled between New Jersey and New York each day, many of whom would visit the building&#x27;s rooftop. The building&#x27;s construction started in April 1906 and the structure was finished the next year.

=== 20th-century use ===
According to a pamphlet for the West Street Building, &quot;the building commends itself particularly to railroads, engineers, dock builders, contractors, lawyers, shippers, and machinery and electrical trades&quot;. The main tenant was the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which operated both the nearby Cortlandt Street Ferry Depot as well as Hoboken Terminal across the Hudson River. This led to the building being nicknamed the &quot;Railroad and Iron Exchange Building&quot; and alternatively as the &quot;Coal and Iron Building&quot;. The top floor was occupied by Garret&#x27;s Restaurant, which was touted as the &quot;world&#x27;s highest restaurant&quot; and was later characterized as the forerunner to World Trade Center&#x27;s Windows on the World restaurant. Other tenants included West Street Improvement Company&#x27;s own members, including Carroll&#x27;s firm Sicilian Asphalt Paving Company as well as the John Peirce Company.

The American Sugar Refining Company (ASR) bought the West Street Building from the West Street Improvement Company in 1913 for $2.3 million, as part of a larger real-estate transaction worth $4.5 million. As partial payment, ASR sold some property in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, as well as some property in Brooklyn. The ASR held the West Street Building as an investment, occupying a small portion of the structure. By 1920 the West Street Building was estimated to be worth $3.5 million, though ASR initially refused to sell.

In 1923, the Brady Security and Realty Corporation bought the building from ASR, and the West Street Building subsequently became the Brady Building. The elevators, first-floor interior, office space and mechanical systems were refurbished during the early 1930s. During the renovation, the original first-floor interior&#x27;s arches and groin vaults were removed, and the facade received some modifications. Further modifications in the mid-20th century resulted in the renovation of the entrances and storefronts, as well as the addition of exterior nighttime lighting and air-conditioning grilles.

Brady sold the building in 1952 to Louis Schleifer for $2.7 million. The &quot;Brady Building&quot; name persisted over several years, despite being sold multiple times through the end of the 20th century. The lobby was renovated in the 1960s and 1980s, which led to the removal of many of the original finishes. The building&#x27;s exterior was designated an architectural landmark by the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1998. However, the interior was not similarly designated, which left it open to future modification.

=== 21st century ===
==== September 11 attacks ====
The building was severely damaged in the September 11 attacks in 2001, when the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed to the north. Scaffolding, which had been erected on the facade for renovation work, failed to prevent debris from falling onto the building. Debris tore a number of large gashes in its northern facade, including one gap between the third and 11th floors. Two office workers were killed when they were trapped in an elevator by falling debris. Several remains of 9/11 victims landed on the northern scaffolding and were not retrieved until 2003.

A firestorm continued for several days; the interior light court functioned as a chimney, causing further damage to the interior. The West Street Building&#x27;s heavy building materials and extensive use of terracotta may have helped serve as fireproofing and protected it from further damage and collapse. This contrasted with the more modern skyscraper at 7 World Trade Center, which suffered similar damage and collapsed on the afternoon of September 11. Nevertheless, falling steel from the World Trade Center resulted in the destruction of the ground-floor Morton&#x27;s The Steakhouse franchise. Following the attacks, a large American flag was flown outside the West Street Building, which became a &quot;symbol of hope&quot; for 9/11 rescuers.

==== Renovation and residential use ====
The building was sold in January 2003 to Brack Capital Real Estate, which wished to turn 90 West Street into a residential building. Brack Capital formed a limited liability company, Brack 90 West Street, to oversee the conversion, then sold a half-share in the company to BD Hotels and the Kibel Company. Because of the scale of the destruction, the inner floors were completely renovated, and plastic sheeting was placed across the north facade to cover the damage. The December 2003 nor&#x27;easter tore open a portion of the sheeting, which was then removed. The developers were subsequently given $106.5 million in federal bonds to renovate the building. Restoration of the lobby revealed some of Gilbert&#x27;s original terracotta work that had been covered over during an earlier modernization project. During this restoration, the copper roof was replaced for $4 million; the granite base was restored for $5 million; replacement gargoyles were added; and over 7,000 replica terracotta tiles were added. A parking garage was also built in the building&#x27;s basement. The interior was converted into apartments and reopened in mid-2005 as 90 West Street, a 410-unit residential building. The next year, it received a National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

90 West Street was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 25, 2007. The designation included the exterior and part of the interior. The building was slightly damaged in November 2007, when a large sewer pipe from the World Trade Center site burst open and flooded the basement, causing a two-week evacuation of the building. The operators of the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum proposed in 2011 to use 90 West Street as a security screening site for museum visitors, which was controversial among the building&#x27;s residents. Despite this, 90 West Street ended up being utilized as a visitors&#x27; center for people traveling to the memorial.

During residential conversion, the building had received a 421-g tax exemption, meant for developers converting Lower Manhattan buildings to residential use, and as such, some of the residential units were rent-stabilized. Tenants of 90 West Street filed a lawsuit in the mid-2010s, stating that the building&#x27;s owner, the Kibel Company, had wrongfully eliminated rent regulation for the building&#x27;s residential units. In 2019, the New York Supreme Court ruled in the tenants&#x27; favor, since the owner had received benefits under the 421-g tax incentive program, and was thus bound to provide stabilized leases for the tenants. The next year, the New York Supreme Court ruled that Kibel only owed rent-stabilized tenants four years of back rent, instead of the six years provided in the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.

== Critical reception ==

Upon its opening, the West Street Building was lauded by other architects and artists. The architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler, in a 1919 &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; article, noted that the West Street Building was uncommon in that it was praised by both the public and by architectural critics. John Merven Carrère, a partner in the architectural firm Carrère and Hastings, said to Gilbert that &quot;I think it is the most successful building of its class.&quot; Edwin Blashfield, a painter, wrote a letter to Gilbert to tell him &quot;what a splendid impression your West Street Building makes on one, as one comes up the harbor on the way back from the other side of the Atlantic.&quot;

Architectural critics approved of the building&#x27;s design as well. An anonymous writer for the &quot;Architectural Record&quot;, possibly Schuyler, said that he appreciated the upper stories, as well as the design of the vertical piers and the Gothic ornamentation. Another writer for the &quot;Architectural Record&quot; stated in 1909 that the structure was &quot;an aesthetic and technical triumph&quot; and &quot;the work of a master mind.&quot; In 1912, a writer for the &quot;Architectural Review&quot; said that the use of ornament and the expression of the building&#x27;s design &quot;account for the excellence of effect of the West Street Building.&quot; An unnamed critic in &quot;Architecture&quot; magazine praised 90 West Street and the Liberty Tower for the use of &quot;a high sloping roof to complete the structure&quot;, saying that &quot;this is a more desirable termination than a plain flat deck&quot;. Further, &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the use of multicolored ornamentation on 90 West Street&#x27;s facade.

Praise for the West Street Building continued even through later years, such as a 1934 article which called the structure among the city&#x27;s &quot;most satisfying buildings.&quot; Ada Louise Huxtable, speaking about a proposed Lower Manhattan development district in 1970, said that the area &quot;contains a few gems of substance such as Cass Gilbert&#x27;s Beaux-Arts Brady Building on West Street.&quot; Herbert Muschamp wrote in 1998 that, after the much taller World Trade Center was completed in the 1970s, &quot;Contemporary critics evidently found it painful to praise Gilbert&#x27;s West Street Building&quot; but that the &quot;wedding cake top&quot; of the mansard roof &quot;looks edible&quot;. The National Park Service, in its 2007 historic-designation report, stated that in addition to 90 West Street&#x27;s importance as one of the first skyscrapers to consistently use of Gothic detailing, the structure &quot;acquired additional historical importance as a witness to and survivor of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.&quot;

<text>The TurboExpress is an 8-bit handheld game console by NEC Home Electronics, released in late 1990 in Japan and the United States, branded as the PC Engine GT in Japan and TurboExpress Handheld Entertainment System in the U.S. It is essentially a portable version of the TurboGrafx-16 home console that came out one to three years earlier. Its launch price in Japan was ¥44,800 and in the U.S.

The TurboExpress was technically advanced for the time, able to play all the TurboGrafx16&#x27;s HuCard games, featuring a backlit, active-matrix color LCD screen, and optional TV tuner.

The TurboExpress primarily competed with Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy, Sega&#x27;s Game Gear, and the Atari Lynx. With 1.5 million units sold, far behind its two main competitors, NEC failed to gain significant sales or market share in the handheld market.

==History==
The TurboExpress&#x27;s codename was &quot;Game Tank&quot;. A working prototype was revealed in the April 1990 issue of VG&amp;CE. It was eventually released in December 1990 in both Japan and the U.S. Its price in the U.S. was briefly raised to $299.99 in March 1991 due to higher costs of the display, before dropping back to its launch price of $249.99, and lowering the price again to $199.99 in 1992.

Regardless of its technical advantages upon its release, the TurboExpress was not widely recognized or adopted by consumers. In addition to NEC&#x27;s marketing issues, the handheld was initially released for $249.99, significantly higher than popular competitors. Because of this price tag, it was labeled as the &quot;Rolls-Royce of handheld systems&quot;. On the other hand, the ability to run the same software as its console counterpart meant that additional portable system specific software did not have to be purchased if already owning the console, resulting in a (oftentimes substantial) cost savings.

==Hardware==
The screen is sized 66 mm (2.6 in.), the same as the original Game Boy. It can display 64 sprites at once, 16 per scanline, in up to 481 colors from a palette of 512. It has 8 kilobytes of RAM, and it runs a HuC6280 CPU at 1.79 or 7.16 MHz, same as TurboGrafx-16.

The TurboExpress had a backlit display. Handheld market leader Nintendo did not have a backlit handheld until the release of the Game Boy Light in 1998. Its keypad layout is similar to that of the original Game Boy, with the unique addition of two &quot;turbo switches&quot; that engage two levels of high-speed controller button re-triggering to assist the player.

Due to a problem with faulty capacitors (an industry-wide issue in the early 1990s), sound failure is a frequent problem with the TurboExpress, sometimes even in new systems. The screen used in the TurboExpress was another source for problems, though it was state of the art when it was released. The LCD technology used was still fairly new and the rate of pixel failure was very high. Brand-new TurboExpress systems often had several bad pixels. Text is also difficult or impossible to read in certain circumstances, as many times fonts were written to be seen on a television screen, not on a small LCD screen. As a result, certain RPGs and adventure games can be difficult to play on the unit.

The TurboExpress plays the same game cartridges as the TurboGrafx-16 home console. Some TurboGrafx-16 HuCards save game data to the internal memory of the TurboGrafx-CD unit, TurboDuo, or TurboBooster Plus (a peripheral for the core TG-16 console). The TurboExpress lacks this internal memory and, as a result, is not capable of saving in this manner. Most games provide a password save mechanism as an alternative.

The battery life is about three hours for 6 AA batteries. This is also a problem for other color and backlit or sidelit handhelds of the time, such as the Game Gear at 5–6 hours, the Sega Nomad at 2–3 hours, and the Atari Lynx at more than 4 hours. Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy had a 12- to 40-hour lifespan on 4 AA batteries.

===Specifications===
*CPU: HuC6280
*CPU speed: 7.16 MHz or 1.79 MHz (switchable in software)
*Resolution: 400x270 pixels
*Color palette: 512 colors; 9-bit RGB
*Max simultaneous colors: 481 on screen
*Max sprites: 64
*Audio: 6-voice wavetable synthesis

===TurboLink===

The TurboLink allows two-player play. &quot;Falcon&quot;, a flight simulator, includes &quot;head-to-head&quot; dogfight and cooperative modes that can only be accessed via TurboLink. This technology was also used for &quot;Bomberman &#x27;93&quot; Com-Link multiplayer. Although it was released after the TurboExpress launch, very few TG-16 games offer co-op play modes especially designed with the TurboExpress in mind.

===TurboVision===

TurboVision is a TV tuner adapter for the TurboExpress converting the TurboExpress into an handheld television. The accessory was available at launch for . It allowed a player to either watch television, or go back to playing games with the flip of a switch; in other words, one may use the TurboExpress as a video monitor. It includes an RCA audio/video input for external composite video signals. Due to the widespread adoption of digital television and the HDTV standard, however, the adapter will no longer function as a television in most places due to the lack of any HDTV digital processing circuitry (the tuner can only process an analog signal for television). Due to this limitation, the TV tuner adapter is now relegated to a collectible for most people, although its RCA audio/video input function will still be operational (albeit limited with its low screen resolution).

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; favorably compared TurboExpress to the Game Boy, but stated that the NEC handheld &quot;gobbles power like crazy ... almost forcing players to &quot;immediately&quot; purchase an AC adapter&quot;. The magazine nonetheless praised its compatibility with TurboGrafx games, and concluded, &quot;to see this machine in action is to fall in love with it&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the new 16 bit computer architecture of the system and the graphics of the games, but warned that the small screen is a downgrade for those used to playing the games on a big screen.

<text>Hillsborough Area Regional Transit (also known as the Hillsborough Transit Authority (HART)) provides public transportation for Hillsborough County, Florida. The agency operates fixed-route local and express bus service, paratransit service, demand-response service, MetroRapid service, and the TECO Line Streetcar system. In , the system had a ridership of .

== History ==

=== Budget cuts and system reorganization (2007 - 2011) ===
Like many local agencies throughout Florida, HART was forced in 2007 to cut its budget by $1.7 million. As a result of this, HARTflex service was canceled and numerous routes saw drawbacks in service. Limited Express Route 52 and Trolley Route 98 were eliminated due to low ridership.

During the 2009/2010 fiscal year, HART slashed another $3 million from its budget in order to compensate for additional property tax revenue losses. This move was achieved by trimming service in Town-N-Country and North Tampa, as well as cutting underutilized trips on numerous routes .

To counteract plummeting property tax revenues, HART proposed to switch to a sales tax-based system which many other transit agencies in Florida already use. Hillsborough County attempted to pass such a measure during the 2010 election season, but it failed by a 58/42% margin .

Despite drawbacks caused by state and county mandated budget cuts and the global recession, HART is striving to improve transit service in the future by managing existing service while only cutting under-performing service and gradually raising fares. HART&#x27;s 2008 Community Report outlined several key changes, such as the introduction of HARTflex service and the upcoming MetroRapid system.

Since 2010, a majority of HART&#x27;s routes have been realigned to better serve patrons throughout the county. These changes included eliminating inefficient segments and trips, realigning travel times, and adding services that would better serve patrons in the long term. Several under-performing routes (such as Neighborhood Connector routes 87, 88, and 89) were eliminated in favor of neighboring transit routes, HARTflex service, or (in the case of Route 59LX) by improved services (Route 61LX). HART also began testing a limited stop route, Route 6LTD, to replace Route 23X.

=== Mission MAX (2017-2020 System-wide Restructuring) ===
With many fiscal impacts looming to negatively impact HART&#x27;s future plans and budgeting - including, but no limited to: reducing the size of the agency&#x27;s debts, preparing for possible reductions in property tax revenues and federal transit funding support, and the national trend of declining transit ridership - the agency announced in early 2017 that it would launch a Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA) of the entire system as part of its next Transit Development Plan (TDP) update. This analysis allowed HART to essentially evaluate every route in the system to see which ones can be improved and which ones would have to be eliminated based on ridership levels and demand. Public outreach began during the spring of 2017 and continued through the summer - eventually leading up to the announcement of a system-wide restructuring effort called Mission MAX, which focuses on modernizing the system to operate with less reliance on traditional transfer hubs and more on a grid system, shorten travel times on key core routes, eliminate out-of-direction travel, and provide more direct service to key destinations. Mission MAX will also provide HART with the foundation that it needs to better analyze and execute future expansion endeavors .

==Services==
HART currently operates 26 local bus and 7 express bus routes. In addition, the agency operates one heritage streetcar route (The TECO Streetcar), 5 HartFlex Van Routes, and the MetroRapid BRT line.

===Local buses===

===Former Routes===
===Neighborhood Flex===
HART provides the HART Flex Service consisting of commuter vans that have routes in designated areas. Walk-up service is provided at regular HART stops along the Flex service route, or patrons can reserve a pick-up or drop-off at a location not a HART stop by calling to reserve between 2 and 72 hours in advance. Walk-up service may be limited by the number of reservations. Fare is $1 per way, and an all-day flex pass available for $2. There is no discount available for seniors, Medicare or disabled as there are on other HART routes; however, up to 3 kids under 6 are free with fare-paying rider. Regular HART 1-Day and 31-Day passes are accepted. The service areas are typically 2.5 miles from a preset route, although at least one Flex area does not have a specific route.

HartFlex Routes
* 571 - South County Flex - Bi-Direction from HCC Southshore Campus to La Estancia Apartments Guadalupe via Sun City Center.

Former HartFlex Routes
* 570 - Brandon Flex - Clockwise Loop from Westfield Brandon Mall to JC Handley PnR. Discontinued on January 24, 2021; partially replaced by extension of Route 38.
* 572 - Northdale Flex - Bi-Direction from Fletcher Ave/Dale Mabry Hwy to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital North via Dale Mabry Hwy. Discontinued on January 24, 2021; replaced by extension of Route 33.
* 573 - Town ‘n Country Flex - Clockwise Loop From Northwest TC to Tampa Community Hospital. Discontinued on January 24, 2021.
* 574 - South Tampa Flex - Counter Clockwise Loop from Britton Plaza to SSA - Frontage Rd/Laural St. Discontinued on January 24, 2021; replaced by restored Route 10 on Cypress Street; alternative service from Britton Plaza and Social Security/MacDonald is available on Route 36 and transfer to Route 30.

===Commuter Express===
In 2004, HART revised its express bus route system. The changes included new routes to Brandon and Pasco County, changes to existing routes (such as Route 28X), and the addition of 12 new Gillig BRT buses to the existing HART bus fleet. Almost all of the Commuter Express routes connected to Downtown Tampa. You can identify express routes by looking at the suffix letters at the end of the number (X means Express and LX means Limited Express). Some express routes operate on a Peak Direction schedule early morning and late afternoon. Others operate on an All-Day schedule. Due to changing ridership patterns, these routes were modified as needed. With the 2016 &quot;Mission MAX&quot; restructuring, Routes 21LX, 22X, 27LX, 28X, 47LX, 61LX, and 200X were all eliminated. Routes 60LX and 360LX were into service on the day &quot;Mission MAX&quot; was established. They’re also the first All-Day Limited Express Routes HART has established providing stops to Brandon, Downtown Tampa, Tampa Int’l Airport and South Tampa seven days a week. Route 275LX became the third All-Day Express Route replacing Route 51X serving Wiregrass, UATC, Downtown Tampa and TIA. There’s also talk about a NEW All-Day Express Route serving the Tampa Airport, Westshore, Downtown Tampa and Plant City. Although the official date of operation is unknown.

===Former Routes===
===MetroRapid Service===

MetroRapid is HART&#x27;s &quot;light&quot; Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, which launched on May 28, 2013. Between May 28 and June 7, HART provided customers a chance to use MetroRapid for free. This allowed customers to get a feel for the new service, while allowing HART staff to work out any last-minute problems before the start of revenue service. MetroRapid officially began revenue service on June 10, 2013, with a formal ribbon cutting held at the Hidden River Corporate Park grounds in Tampa Palms.

MetroRapid currently consists of one line, the north–south line (numbered as Route 400), which runs from Downtown Tampa (MTC) to the University Area Transit Center (UATC) via Nebraska and Fletcher Avenues every day, every 15 minutes. It replaced Route 2.

===TECO Line Streetcar System===

This service is a 2.7-mile streetcar line that runs along Downtown Tampa, through the Channel District, and Ybor City. The system features historical replica streetcars of the original Tampa Streetcar Line. The TECO Line Streetcar is now FREE with extended morning and late night hours.

In its heyday, Tampa&#x27;s streetcars whisked passengers to and from Ybor City, Ballast Point, Hyde Park, Sulphur Springs and points beyond. Operated by uniformed conductors, the Birney cars were a welcome sight, and the familiar clang of the streetcar bell was music to the ears. To ride the streetcar was to feel the pulse of the community.

Tampa&#x27;s first electric streetcar lines built in 1892 quickly became an essential part of everyday life as workers took the streetcar downtown and to the cigar factories of west Tampa. And families climbed aboard for a picnic or ball game in DeSoto and Macfarlane parks. Reaching the peak of its popularity in the 1920s with almost 24 million passengers in 1926, Tampa&#x27;s streetcar system rolled to a stop in August 1946 following World War II.

Today, electric streetcars are back in Tampa, supporting continued growth in Downtown, the Channel District and Ybor City. The TECO Line Streetcar System is a 2.7 mile section that connects these three areas, improving transportation capacity, supporting Tampa&#x27;s thriving cruise industry and transporting workers to and from their jobs

=== Late-night service ===

In 2006, HART introduced late-night bus service on nine local bus routes in order to meet the diverse needs of its patrons. Some of these routes now run as late as 12 am as a result in the increase of service. Since 2007, the number of routes running weekday services beyond 8:00pm has increased to 16 routes.

== Fares ==
* One-way fares on Local &amp; Limited Express: $2.00
* One-way fares on Express: $3.00
* Unlimited one-day Local &amp; Limited Express pass: $4.00
* Unlimited one-day Express pass: $6.00
* Unlimited 31 day Local &amp; Limited Express pass: $65
* Unlimited 31 day Express pass: $95

HART fares listed above will be given a 50% discount if a proper HART ID card is present prior to purchase.

HART has a partnership with the University of South Florida, where students can ride HART local, limited express, and flex routes for free if they show the bus operator their USF ID. USF Faculty &amp; Staff can use the same services for only 50 cents

=== Transit Centers ===
Like many transit agencies, HART has operated its bus system similar to a hub and spoke model. However, with system redesigns taking place in 2005 and 2017, the reliance on traditional hubs has lessened in favor of a grid-based system where transfers are done at key intersections and corridors.

The main hub for HART is the Marion Transit Center in Downtown Tampa, serving 16 local and express routes (including PSTA&#x27;s 100X and 300X) from 17 Bus Platforms (Platform A-N surrounding the station and the East, North and West Platforms), and also serves as stops for FlixBus and Greyhound. The center was constructed in 2001, replacing the obsolete Northern Terminal, which sat underneath the I-275 viaduct. The Marion Transit Center is located at the northern end of the Marion Street Transitway and includes a customer service center, office space, bus driver lounge, restrooms, bus shelters, and an array of public art displays. Was under construction where the station is being resurfaced since November 4, 2019 and completed construction on June 1, 2020. Serving Routes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 19, 30, 20X, 60LX, 275LX, 360LX, PSTA Routes 100X and 300X, and the MetroRapid North-South Line. HARTPlus also serves the station since June 8.

Other major bus terminals include:
*University Area Transit Center: Constructed in the late 1990s and located in the USF area (within the quadrant of 131st Ave, Livingston Ave, N 27th St, and 132nd Ave), the UATC is the transfer point for 10 local bus routes. This facility includes bus shelters, restrooms, and a customer service center. Prior to the UATC&#x27;s construction, HART spent several years juggling around several different locations as a transfer point in the university area, including University Mall. However, the University Mall plan failed to materialize due to financial problems and community opposition. .. Serving Routes 1, 5, 6, 9, 12, 33, 42, 48, 275LX and the MetroRapid North-South Line.
*NetPark Transfer Center: Located in east Tampa (off 56th Street and Hillsborough Ave), this facility is a transfer point for 8 local routes and includes restrooms, phones, and vending machines and will serve as a stop for HART&#x27;s MetroRapid system. Serving Routes 6, 15, 32, 34, 37, 38, 39 and 48.
*West Tampa Transfer Center: Located right next to Raymond James Stadium. Permanently closed following the Mission MAX system redesign in 2017. HART currently has no immediate intention to reactivate the hub and could sell the land in the distant future for redevelopment if longer-term plans deem it necessary to do so. During the Tampa Bay Buccaneers home games, the station will be open for HART MVP Express which operate for $10 round trip. Northbound trips on Routes 32, 36 and 45 have closest bus stops to provide entrance to Raymond James while Route 7 has stops on MLK Blvd/Himes Ave when events are available (Effective 8/16/2019)
*Northwest Transfer Center: Located on the corner of Sheldon Road and Waters Ave, the Northwest Transfer Center replaced the makeshift bus depot at Hanley/Waters Plaza. Construction began in the spring of 2007 and was dedicated/opened to patrons July 29, 2008 . The new facility is equipped with vending machines, restrooms for both patrons and employees, an adjacent park-n-ride lot and 4 local bus routes, and eight bus loading bays. Serving Routes 16, 34, 35, 39, Town-N-Country FLEX service, and the PSTA Tampa/Oldsmar Flex Connector.
*Tampa International Airport Rental Car Facility Bus Hub: Located on the grounds of TPA Airport, adjacent to the new Rental Car Facility, five bus loading bays along a straightaway drive allows for loading and unloading of transit buses, with future expansion in mind. Customers can easily connect to and from the airport terminal via SkyConnect. Serving Routes 30, 32, 35, 60LX, 275LX, and PSTA Route 300X.

===Secondary Bus Terminals===
*WestShore Plaza - WestShore Business District: Routes 15, 45, and South Tampa FLEX.
*Britton Plaza - South Tampa/Interbay: Routes 17, 19, 36, 360LX, South Tampa FLEX, and PSTA Route 100X.
*SouthShore Regional Service Center - SouthShore/Ruskin: Routes 31 and SouthShore FLEX.
*Westfield Brandon - Brandon: Routes 8, 31, 37, 46, 75LX, and Brandon FLEX.
*Yukon Transfer Center - Sulphur Springs: Routes 14, 16, 42, and 45.

===The Marion Street Transitway===
Constructed in the 1980s, the Marion Street Transitway provides a line of bus shelters along the street to allow patrons to easily board and deboard buses within Downtown Tampa. The transitway runs from the Marion Transit Center to Whiting Street and was originally a &quot;fare-free&quot; zone until 2008. All of the shelters along the transitway were equipped with departure time signage but have been removed.

==Plans==
HART has the following projects planned to begin service within the next five years.

===West Shore Multi-Modal Center===
HART and the Hillsborough County Aviation Authority have been discussing plans to build a transfer center at Tampa International Airport since 2008. Originally, the facility was to be located at the corner of O&#x27;Brien and Spruce streets but was dropped in 2011 in favor of a site closer to the TIA terminal. Plans for any type of transfer center on TIA property collapsed in 2012 following the impact of global economic downturn and the consolidation of the airline industry on TIA&#x27;s broad terminal expansion plans. In March, 2013, plans were unveiled for a possible Multi-Modal center along Interstate 275 in the WestShore Business District that could cater to multiple bus connections, light rail or commuter rail lines, and a People Mover system connecting the airport. This plan is heavily dependent on whether public transit in both Hillsborough and Pinellas counties are able to further expand. This in-turn, would be dependent on future funding situations . As of 2020, the multi-modal center remains a part of the Florida Department of Transportation&#x27;s Tampa Bay NEXT interstate-based transportation plan.

===Intelligent Transportation Systems===
According to HART&#x27;s 2008 Community Report, efforts are currently underway to construct an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Elements of this project include installing surveillance cameras and audio monitoring equipment, GPS systems, automated annunciator systems, real-time information display signs and other elements to all HART buses and several transfer centers. Such systems will allow patrons in the future to see in real-time, upcoming departures, major intersections, landmarks, and connecting routes. Many of these elements, including GPS, security, and automated annunciator systems were installed during the course of 2008 through 2010.

===American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009===
HART is slated to receive just over $15 million from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 that President Barack Obama signed into law in February 2009. Among the improvements that HART proposed to make: an expansion and upgrade to its operations facility in Ybor City, secure the purchase of 30 forty-foot Gillig Low Floor buses, streetcar extension, and the repainting of HART&#x27;s existing fleet. ()

===TRANSitFORMATION===
In September 2019, HART has several plans for the future of transportation in Hillsborough County under the hashtag #TRANSitFORMATION. Some of these plans include improvements and added services on select routes, more detailed information and improvements in bus shelters, adding electric bus pilots to their fleet and replacing select gas/diesel fuel buses, adding more Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) routes along Florida Ave, Nebraska Ave and Fowler Ave. also, HART has planned future commuter passenger rail or high speed rail transport across Hillsborough and its neighboring counties among the CSX rail corridor and possible future extensions for the TECO Streetcar Line.

== Fleet ==

As of October 2023, most local/express HART buses are in the blue and white livery. Trolley buses are in a similar pale blue/white livery, and MetroRapid buses are in a green/gray/white livery. (As Of May 2019 Only Some MetroRapid Units are in the MetroRapid Livery.) Since the May 2019 incident, most buses have protection driver doors to protect its operator from future offenses.

The repainting of buses was done to match the livery that is already carried by Commuter Express buses. However, instead of the purple and white livery of the express buses, local buses were repainted in a blue and white scheme (matching the colors of HART&#x27;s logo). Bus #2015 was the first bus to be painted in the new colors, returning to service in August 2008, upon the receipt of federal stimulus funds in 2009, HART accelerated the repainting process, allowing more buses to sport the new livery.

In 2008, the agency acquired 12 25-foot Champion/Freightliner T-300 buses (from Dallas Area Rapid Transit) to be used on the fixed-route system while its existing fleet was repainted. These buses were retired in March and April 2010, with the arrival of the 29 40-foot 2010 model (10XX) Gillig Low Floor buses.

Beginning in August 2009, HART retired its fleet of Gillig Phantom buses, which the agency purchased in 1996 and 1997 to replace Flxible Metro buses purchased during the 1980s. These buses were replaced by 30 2009 model (29XX) year Gillig Low Floor buses that were purchased with the help of federal stimulus funds. Although seven of the Phantoms were already taken out of service in 2007, HART kept three (#s 602, 608, and 609) in service beyond that time. By mid September, 2009, all of the Gillig Phantom buses were retired, along with most of the models. The final nine buses that were phased out during the week of September 30, 2009, included #s 703, 708, 711, 713, 717, 720, 723, 725, and 726, with #725 being featured at HART&#x27;s 30th Anniversary Ceremony on September 30.

In November 2011, HART was awarded a $2.3 million federal grant to build a CNG fueling station at its operations facility. It was completed in 2013. In 2014, HART began purchasing Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) transit buses, along with a small fleet of CNG powered paratransit vans. In total as of 2020, there are 70 CNG powered buses in the fleet, though one (# 1708) was retired earlier in the year due to severe accident damage.

In 2020, the agency received a $2.7 million federal grant to purchase 4 electric buses . These buses are expected to be on the road by 2022, though it is unclear which manufacturer will be selected to produce them.

<text>Ultimate X-Men is a superhero comic book series, which was published by Marvel Comics, from 2001 to 2009. The series is a modernized re-imagining of Marvel&#x27;s long-running X-Men comic book franchise as part of the Ultimate Marvel imprint. The Ultimate X-Men exist alongside other revamped Marvel characters in Ultimate Marvel titles including &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;The Ultimates&quot;.

The protagonists are the X-Men, a group of teen-aged mutants: a subspecies of the human race, who possess latent super-human abilities from birth, due to the presence of the mysterious &quot;X-Gene&quot; within their genetic codes. It sets them apart from the rest of humanity and despite being feared and distrusted by the general public and authorities, they use their super-powers to prevent and stop unnatural threats to both the human and mutant race, while being mentored by Professor Charles Xavier, The X-Men&#x27;s founder and a world-renowned expert on genetics and the world&#x27;s most powerful telepath. The series features many characters and storylines similar to those of the original X-Men series. &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; almost completely ignores supernatural or mystical elements as plot devices, and the X-Men have no secret identities, and mutants are distrusted and hunted down. 

The series began in 2001 under writer Mark Millar and artists Adam Kubert and Andy Kubert, while the final issues of the series were written by Aron Coleite and penciled by Mark Brooks. &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; was met with considerable commercial success, even outselling most of the other X-Men comic titles and received a generally positive response from critics and readers, who praised the art-work by various artists, the writing runs of Millar, Bendis, Vaughan, Kirkman and Coleite, the character development and progression of the titular superheroes throughout the series and the unique and interesting twists on conventional X-Men themes and concepts, along with the fresh and distinctively modernized re-imagining of the classic X-Men mythos, while the uneven quality of the writing, the somewhat edgy and unnecessarily adult-oriented tone and direction of the comics and some of the changes and deviations from the original X-Men comics were singled out for criticism.

A quasi-sequel/spinoff titled &quot;Ultimate Comics: X&quot; began in February 2010, but only lasted for 5 issues. The series focused on Wolverine&#x27;s secret son Jimmy Hudson, Jean Grey, and several other mutants dealing with the aftermath of &quot;Ultimatum&quot;.

Ultimate X-Men was later relaunched by Nick Spencer and Paco Medina, with the title now called &quot;Ultimate Comics: X-Men&quot;.

==Publishing history==

Upon its debut in February 2001, &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; was the second comic of the Ultimate Marvel line, preceded a few months by its sister title &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;. The heads of the Ultimate Universe line, Bill Jemas and Joe Quesada, originally tried to hire Brian Michael Bendis to write the title, but he declined. Marvel hired Scottish writer Mark Millar, who was best known at the time for his run on &quot;The Authority&quot; and was largely ignorant of the X-Men franchise. With the 2000 &quot;X-Men&quot; film as his only reference, Millar reinvented the X-Men. As a result, Millar&#x27;s original X-Men consisted of telepath Professor X, Cyclops, whose eyes shoot concussive beams, telepathic and telekinetic Jean Grey, weather-manipulating Storm, simian genius Beast, metal-skinned Colossus, and cryokinetic Iceman. Millar&#x27;s roster soon expanded to include teleporting Nightcrawler, intangible Kitty Pryde and power absorbing Rogue.

Common to the Millar period was an edgy tone, featuring quick action-driven plots and less moral X-Men. For instance, Wolverine tries to kill Cyclops in &quot;Return of the King&quot; because he is envious of Jean&#x27;s love. In an interview with &quot;Sequential Tart&quot;, Millar commented, &quot;You&#x27;re not competing with Cartoon Network on these books; you&#x27;re competing with &#x27;Buffy&#x27;...Superhero comics aren&#x27;t adult, but they shouldn&#x27;t be written for five-year-olds either.&quot; Millar shaped &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; into a commercial hit, consistently outselling its sister titles, &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; and &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;.

After Mark Millar&#x27;s run, &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; writer Brian Michael Bendis took over for a year. Bendis stated that his run on the book would be more character-driven, especially concerning Wolverine, who had previously tried to kill his teammate Cyclops. Bendis&#x27; run was marked by the introductions of Angel and Dazzler to the team, relative absence of major villains and was also notorious for killing Beast, who was killed when a Sentinel attacked the White House. This made Beast the first dead Ultimate X-Man. As a side note, &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #40 features what Marvel claims to be the first marriage proposal in a comic book letters column, which is answered in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #44 with a positive response.

The third &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; writer was Brian K. Vaughan, best known at the time for his work on &quot;&quot;, and, subsequently, &quot;Saga&quot;. His run was marked by the relative absence of Wolverine as the main character and the re-imagining of second-string &quot;X-Men&quot; characters. He introduced Mr. Sinister as a mutant-killing scientist with hypnosis and stealth powers in &quot;The Tempest&quot; (#46–49), German twins Fenris as mutant corporate criminals in &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; (#50–53), as well as Mojo and Longshot as a corrupt TV producer and a mutant felon, respectively in &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; (#54–57). Both are of non-alien origin in this world and have the civilian names &quot;Arthur Centino&quot; and &quot;Mojo Adams&quot;, a play on the names of their creators, writer Ann Nocenti and artist Art Adams. Further arcs were centered on Professor X (#58) and Deathstrike in &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; (#59–60). Lady Deathstrike possesses adamantium claws and regenerative powers. Vaughan also reintroduced Magneto, and established Ultimate Colossus to be homosexual.

On working within the Ultimate Universe, Vaughan wrote: &quot;In my mind, the X-Men shouldn&#x27;t be teachers or celebrities or even traditional superheroes. They&#x27;re students, confused, sometimes reckless teenagers who are feared and hated because their bodies are undergoing frightening changes... The Ultimate Universe restores that small but crucial element.&quot;

Vaughan&#x27;s run was followed by Robert Kirkman, author of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot; comic books. Kirkman&#x27;s run was noted for adapting several major storyarcs from the regular X-Men series. These included Jean Grey&#x27;s transformation into Phoenix, the arrival of Cable and Bishop, and the appearance of Apocalypse. Kirkman reintroduced Wolverine as an important character, and played with issues of team loyalty. Under his authorship, major characters such as Nightcrawler and Colossus left the team. His tenure also featured Cyclops&#x27; decision to turn Xavier&#x27;s into a more traditional school and consequently disband the X-Men. When this was done an alternate team of X-Men was formed by Bishop as part of the upcoming fight against Apocalypse. After the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline, nearly all of the X-Men were killed, and the team disbanded.

After the events in &quot;Ultimatum&quot; the book, along with &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot;, was canceled after its 100th issue. A follow-up one-shot, called &quot;Requiem&quot;, was released and concluded the series&#x27; story. A new series, &quot;Ultimate Comics: X&quot;, debuted in early 2010 and featured Kitty Pryde, Wolverine&#x27;s son, Jimmy Hudson and Jean Grey.

&quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; was then relaunched as &quot;Ultimate Comics: X-Men&quot; with writer Nick Spencer and artist Paco Medina. The series stars Jimmy Hudson, Kitty Pryde, Johnny Storm, Bobby Drake and Rogue.

=== 2024 relaunch ===
In October 2023 at New York Comic Con Marvel revealed that, following the conclusion of &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; and the creation of a brand new Ultimate Universe, a new volume of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; would launch in March 2024 written and illustrated by Peach Momoko.

===Commercial success===
&quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; quickly established itself as a hit comic, lauded by critics and popular with the fans. The following table shows the development of comic sales in comparison to the mainstream titles.

==Characters==
===X-Men===
* Professor Charles Xavier, telepath and telekinetic, is the founder and patron of the X-Men. He is an idealist and a pacifist, but less saintly than his mainstream counterpart. The Professor possesses vast knowledge and acquires advanced surgical skills he gleans from reading surgeons&#x27; minds (&quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;). He is the ex-husband of Dr. Moira MacTaggert with whom he worked to help mutants, devising new therapies and surgical techniques for their unique patients, and had a son named David. He suffered a spinal injury at the hands of his old friend, Magneto during an escape from his increasingly militaristic island society, the Savage Land, an injury that left him a paraplegic and ultimately a wheelchair user. He has a business relationship with the mysterious Lilandra, the majestrix of the pagan Shi&#x27;ar cult. After Jean Grey is kidnapped by the time-traveling Cable, Professor Xavier reveals to Cyclops that he is in love with her. Professor X is seemingly killed when he dives to protect Cyclops from a bomb that Cable detonates. It is subsequently revealed that he did not die, but was transported to Cable&#x27;s future. He is however murdered by Magneto during the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; miniseries.
* Angel, Warren Worthington III, is a handsome, shy, and winged mutant. He is Dazzler&#x27;s boyfriend before she is put into a coma. He has been &quot;expelled&quot; from the X-Men; in reality, he is spying for Xavier. Without Bishop&#x27;s consent, Dazzler has recruited him to be a part of the new X-Men. Angel is later killed by Sinister as part of Apocalypse&#x27;s resurrection, but is restored to life by the Phoenix. He is later killed again by Sabretooth during the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline.
* Beast, simian mutant and genius Henry &quot;Hank&quot; McCoy, is turned into a blue, furry beast by the insidious Weapon X project. He serves as the team&#x27;s elite engineer, upgrading the Blackbird and Danger Room sequences. When chatting online to the Blob (pretending to be an interested girl), he accidentally reveals Magneto survived Xavier&#x27;s earlier attack. He has a troubled romance with Storm, until he is killed in a Sentinel attack. It is revealed that Hank has been alive all this time, secretly working for S.H.I.E.L.D. on the Legacy Virus, until he escapes to return to the X-Men and Storm. Beast eventually dies in the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; wave.
* Colossus, Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Rasputin, can turn into organic steel and reluctantly works as an arms smuggler before joining the X-Men. Recently, Colossus has made peace with his former friend Nightcrawler. Colossus in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; can transmute his entire body into organic steel, a form which gives him seeming invulnerability and superhuman strength.
* Cyclops, Scott Summers, whose eyes emit concussive blasts, is the boy scout-like X-Men field leader. Initially shy and aloof, he learns to be an unrivaled leader and pursue his interests, notably the love of Jean Grey, an interest that has often puts him at odds with his teammate Wolverine. He revisits his dead parents in a dream world he calls &quot;Corsair&quot;. After the &quot;death&quot; of Xavier, Cyclops disbands the X-Men to utilize the school as a safe haven and educational center for mutants. He is assassinated by Quicksilver at the end of the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; event.
* Dazzler, Allison &quot;Ali&quot; Blaire, is a tough-as-nails rock singer with photovoltaic powers who is heavily pierced and tattooed and wears slashed clothing. She becomes Angel&#x27;s girlfriend after he takes the blame for something she does. She is stabbed and put into a coma by Storm&#x27;s old mentor Lady Deathstrike. During her recovery, Nightcrawler develops an obsessive crush on her, eventually culminating in him kidnapping her when she awakes. She leaves the team in disgust when Xavier tries to rehabilitate him. Bishop later recruits Dazzler as a member of his new X-Men team. She dies in the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; wave.
* Iceman, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake, is a hot-headed youth with cold-based powers, who is in the throes of puberty but loyal to the X-Men&#x27;s cause. He is very fickle, pursuing girls then losing interest and back to being interested again. He has a fear of Magneto and is often seen eating or playing video games. Recently, he rekindled his relationship with Rogue when her absorbing powers were halted after she absorbed Gambit&#x27;s powers for an extended period of time.
* Marvel Girl, or Jean Grey has telepathic and telekinetic powers. She is outgoing, witty and scathingly sarcastic, but can also be a very responsible young woman and is the unofficial second-in-command behind Cyclops. After an affair with Wolverine, she begins a steady relationship with Cyclops. The Shi&#x27;ar religion believes Jean to be the host of the Phoenix Force, their supposed god. Jean becomes the headmistress of the school, alongside Scott, after Xavier supposedly dies. When the X-Men battle Apocalypse, she merges with the Phoenix and destroys him with her god-like abilities and restarts time so this event will not happen. She leaves the team but returns promptly, to the surprise of the others.
* Nightcrawler, the Bavarian mutant teleporter Kurt Wagner, is a former Weapon X prisoner. He has a crush on Dazzler and is resentful that she chose Angel instead of him. Despite his own struggles with being rejected for being different, he is uncomfortable with Colossus&#x27; homosexuality and shuns him as a friend. He was being kept sedated after a failed attempt to kidnap Dazzler, but eventually escaped after Xavier&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;. Nightcrawler would go on to not only join the Morlocks, but become their chosen leader. He is later killed in the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; wave.
* Psylocke, or Betsy Braddock is a telepath who started off as a corporal for S.T.R.I.K.E., the British division of S.H.I.E.L.D.. She worked alongside her partner, Agent Dai Thomas, but during an encounter with Xavier&#x27;s reality-warping son David, her body was possessed and destroyed. Betsy transferred her mind into the body of a comatose Japanese girl named Kwannon. As this girl was a minor, Betsy was too young to serve as a government agent so she brought her formidable psychic abilities to the X-Men, reuniting with them for the first time since the destruction of her original body. Taking the codename Psylocke, she not only retained her telepathy but also learned to channel it into a psychic knife capable of cutting through any material.
* Rogue, or Marian, originally drains life-force and memories on skin contact. She is abducted into the Weapon X program under unknown circumstances. Like her mainstream counterpart, she can absorb mutant powers. When she is liberated, she first joins the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, then defects to the X-Men, then leaves the team in the company of Gambit after her boyfriend Bobby Drake cheats on her with Kitty Pryde. After absorbing his powers, which last for an extended period of time, during a battle with Juggernaut (in which Gambit dies), she inherits his energy-charging powers. This negates her absorbing power and she becomes able to touch people without draining their abilities or memories as shown when she and her ex-boyfriend, Iceman, have sex in the &quot;Date Night&quot; arc. These powers have since faded, leaving her with her previous absorbing powers.
* Shadowcat, Kitty Pryde, can walk through walls. She is a young, but dedicated girl. Like her mainstream counterpart, her devotion to her Jewish faith is evidenced by her ever-present Star of David. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man Annual&quot; #1 she begins dating Peter Parker, better known as Spider-Man. She left the team to live with her mother in Queens, where she is now enrolled in Peter Parker&#x27;s high school. Her relationship with Peter has ended, however, and she has shown an interest in dating Peter&#x27;s classmate Kenny &quot;Kong&quot; McFarlane.
* Storm, Ororo Munroe, like the phenomena from which she takes her name, has a unique mutant ability which allows her to harness and manipulate forces of nature. Calling upon the elements she can manifest violent storms, summon lightning from a benign sky, create blizzards instantly and even whip up winds to bear herself aloft. A streetwise car thief who hails from Morocco, Ororo&#x27;s sharp wit and cynicism can make her come off as arrogant, but, with that arrogance comes a near-unparalleled sense of level-headedness that allows her to temper as the voice of reason among the X-Men. Between the purported death of her boyfriend Beast, her fleeting relationships with Wolverine, and her role as second-in-command of Bishop&#x27;s X-Men, Ororo&#x27;s confidence has continued to grow, as has her skill with her mutant abilities.
* Wolverine, James &quot;Logan&quot; Howlett, has animal instincts and extreme regeneration powers. He is turned into an amnesiac, emotionless killer by Weapon X. Wolverine resurfaces as the cold-blooded elite assassin of Magneto and infiltrates the X-Men to kill Professor X. He betrays Magneto, however, and joins the X-Men after coming to understand and believe in Xavier&#x27;s cause. Over the course of the series in between attacks by former members of Weapon X, Wolverine has searched for answers regarding his long-forgotten past. He is killed by Magneto near the end of the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; series.

===Villains and supporting cast===

&quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; introduced revised versions of classic X-Men villains, such as mutant supremacist, would-be world conqueror, and evil genius mastermind Magneto. He heads the anti-human and genetic terrorist group Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy. The series also features the amoral, Mengele-like mutant super-weapon project Weapon X, the shady Hellfire Club and many more.

In addition, the Academy of Tomorrow is the Ultimate Marvel version of a spin-off X-Men team called the New Mutants. In this world, the group consists of: headmistress Emma Frost, who can turn her skin into organic diamond; Cyclops&#x27; older brother Havok (Alex Summers), who shoots concussive blasts from his hands; airborne Sam Guthrie, or Cannonball; mutant genius Doug Ramsey, also known as Cypher; Canadian speedster Jean-Paul Beaubier, or Northstar; Havok&#x27;s girlfriend, Lorna Dane, the magnekinetic Polaris; Roberto da Costa, the Brazilian solar-powered Sunspot; and recently Angel. The Shi&#x27;ar are a religious movement, led by &quot;Majestrix Lilandra&quot;. They worship the &quot;Phoenix God&quot;, which they think is reincarnated in the X-Man Marvel Girl (Jean Grey).

The Ultimate version of Cable is revealed to be a future version of Wolverine, who kidnaps Charles Xavier in an attempt to prevent the coming of Apocalypse.

&quot;Syndicate&quot; is the name of two mutants, psi-resistant conjoined twins named Luke and Matthew. They try to rob a bank to help their terminally ill sister, but are stopped by Professor X. Realizing their plight, he gives them a chance to redeem themselves by working as his private agents. Created by Brian K. Vaughan and Steve Dillon, they first appeared in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #58. The characters have an unusual heart which pumps out electromagnetic pulses with each beat; this disables almost any electrical system. Their interlinked brain matter also makes them immune to telepathic control, although they are still susceptible to mind readings.

In the shared universe of Ultimate Marvel, the X-Men have more than once crossed the paths of other superheroes: Peter Parker is a good friend of the X-Men and is Shadowcat&#x27;s ex-boyfriend. The X-Men share a wary truce with Nick Fury and the Ultimates, who have been both their best benefactors (&quot;New Mutants&quot; arc) and as adversaries (&quot;Ultimate War&quot;) in the past. The Ultimate Fantastic Four have met the X-Men in &quot;Ultimate X4&quot; and the teams are generally on positive terms.

===Settings===
* The X-Men live in the X-Mansion in Westchester, New York. Its location was a secret at first, but is now known to the world. It contains the Danger Room, a virtual reality dome in which the X-Men can fight against hard-light holographic enemies. It has been used several times for in-jokes and popular culture references. Once, the junior X-Men fought the Brood, and for recreation, Nightcrawler simulated scenes similar to &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.
* Genosha is an apartheid state in which mutants are discriminated against. Krakoa is an island not far off Genosha, where Mojo Adams&#x27; &quot;Hunt for Justice&quot; reality show is held.
* Muir Island is an island in the north of Scotland and the location of Dr. Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s lab.

==In other media==

* In the video games &quot;X-Men Legends&quot; and &quot;X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse&quot;, the characteristic tight black-and-golden costumes of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; are the default outfits of the X-Men. The traditional costumes can be unlocked as throwbacks after the player has unlocked them by completing acts within the game. Additionally, many of the other characters (such as the Brotherhood) have their Ultimate costumes as their default outfit. Characters in these games who had not yet appeared in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; at the time that the games were released either appear wearing their Earth-616 (&#x27;classic&#x27;) costumes or appear in a new costume that is in the same black-and-gold style as the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; suits.
* In the &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; animated series, Wolverine wears his &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; look from season 3 onwards. In the final episode &quot;Ascension&quot;, future adult versions of the teenage X-Men can be seen. Their normally bright, colorful costumes have changed into the dark &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; outfits.
* In the final arc of &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;, a fleet of Sentinels are sent to Genosha to attack Magneto and the mutants living there. However, like in &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, Magneto disassembles all of the Sentinels, reprogramming them to attack humans. He then launches an attack upon New York.
* &quot;Ultimate X-Men Vol. 1: The Tomorrow People&quot; appears in nine parts as an unlockable in &quot;Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects&quot;. Each part is unlocked after completing a specific bonus level.
* Wolverine and Bolivar Trask appear as the bosses in the video game &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;.
* Ultimate costumes of Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Magneto and Sabretooth appear in the video game &quot;&quot;.

<text>Florida Memorial University is a private historically black college in Miami Gardens, Florida. Founded as the Florida Baptist Institute, today it claims a focus on broader Christianity and is a member of the United Negro College Fund.

== History ==
Florida Memorial University was founded in 1879 as the Florida Baptist Institute in Live Oak, Florida. It is one of the oldest academic centers in the state. Soon after, the American Baptist Home Mission Society gave the school its full support, and the first regular school year began in 1880.

J. L. A. Fish (1828–1890) was its first president. Despite a promising start, racial tensions soon cast a shadow over the institute. In April 1892, after unknown persons fired shots into one of the school&#x27;s buildings, then-President Matthew Gilbert and other staff members fled Live Oak for Jacksonville, where they founded the Florida Baptist Academy in the basement of Bethel Baptist Church. They began holding classes in May 1892, with Sarah Ann Blocker as the main instructor. The school in Live Oak, however, continued to operate even after this splintering.

Nathan W. Collier, President of Florida Baptist Institute, and Sarah Ann Blocker, of Florida Baptist Academy, combined the two institutions to found Florida Normal and Technical Institute in 1896. Collier was president of the college from 1896 to 1941, and Blocker Dean of Women and vice-president from 1896 to 1944.

Brothers James Weldon Johnson and J. Rosamond Johnson (faculty member), wrote the words and music in 1900 to &quot;Lift Ev&#x27;ry Voice and Sing&quot; (known as the &quot;Negro National Anthem&quot;).

Florida Normal and Industrial Institute moved to St. Augustine in 1918 and operated in buildings on a tract of land, the site of the &quot;Old Hanson Plantation&quot;. It had been based on the forced labor of enslaved African Americans.

In 1941, the Live Oak and St. Augustine institutions merged, changing their limited offerings from a junior college classification to a four-year liberal arts institution; it graduated its first four-year class in 1945. The young author Zora Neale Hurston taught at the school in 1942; she lived on the second floor of a two-story house at 791 West King Street, just east of the campus.

The school&#x27;s name was changed in 1950 to Florida Normal and Industrial Memorial College. In 1963, the charter was amended to change the name to Florida Memorial College. Concerned by race-related violence in the city in relation to the civil rights movement (see St. Augustine movement), in 1965 the college bought a tract of land in what was then rural Dade County and developed the campus there.

In 1968, the college relocated to its present site (now &quot;northwest Miami&quot;). By 1972, it graduated its first class at the Miami site. Florida Memorial College celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1979 and began a series of expansion projects on the campus.

In 1993, Albert E. Smith was appointed as the college&#x27;s tenth president. He also directed a period of growth. On July 3, 2006, Karl S. Wright became the eleventh president.

Roslyn Clark Artis was appointed interim president in 2013 and became the 13th president in 2014; she was the first female President in the institution&#x27;s 138-year history. In 2017 she left to become the first female President of Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina in its 147-year history.

For years the college was based in what was classified as the Opa-locka North census-designated place, in an unincorporated area. In 2003 this was incorporated as the city of Miami Gardens.

In 2006, Florida Memorial College changed its name to Florida Memorial University, a reflection of its expansion in graduate offerings.

== Academics ==
Florida Memorial University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. It offers 41 undergraduate degree programs and four graduate degree programs through its eight academic divisions in six academic schools. The business programs are accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs. The social work program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The Music Department is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM).

The institution has offered an honors program for 10 years that is designed to target and challenge students to their highest level.

The institution also offers pre-college programs to reach out to the surrounding community. It addresses critical urban needs and helps more than 700 youth through the Lion&#x27;s Pre-College Experience Institute. The institute offers several programs that focus on academic achievement and higher learning, with an emphasis on physical fitness, dropout prevention, religion, financial management, entrepreneurship, and personal development.

===Library===
The Nathan W. Collier Library was named after Nathan White Collier, who served as the third president of Florida Baptist Academy for forty-five years. Collier was responsible for tireless fundraising and advocating; acquiring property and land; increasing enrollment and attracting nationally renowned faculty. Collier tried to replicate the educational aims and programs of Booker T. Washington. His greatest contribution was to the education and training of Black teachers throughout Florida.

The Collier library houses 120,000 volumes, two Information Commons areas as well as separate Electronic, Teaching, Periodicals, Audiovisual and Group study rooms. The library subscribes to 30 databases, 519 periodicals and contains two special collections: The Rev. I. C. Mickins Theological and Sermonic Research, and the Dr. Laban Connor Black Collection.
The library also houses the Trayvon Martin Foundation, in honor of Trayvon Martin, established in March 2012 by Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin as &quot;a nonprofit organization whose main purpose is to provide emotional and financial support to families who have lost a child to gun violence.&quot;

== Athletics ==
The Florida Memorial athletic teams are called the Lions. The institution is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Sun Conference (formerly known as the Florida Sun Conference (FSC) until after the 2007–08 school year) since the 1990–91 academic year. Its football program began competing in the Mid-South Conference (MSC) from the 2020 to 2021 fall seasons.

Florida Memorial competes in 13 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, football, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball, flag football, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading.

===Football===
The institution played football under the name Florida Normal and Industrial Institute from 1946-58 (except 1949), competing in the Southeastern Athletic Conference. The Lions&#x27; record in those twelve seasons was 41 wins, 25 losses and six ties, with a 14–8 win over Albany State in their final game of 1958. The football program was re-instated in 2020, after a 62 year hiatus. The &quot;new&quot; Lions got their first victory on October 23, 2021, defeating Union College. 41–17.

<text>Pete Atkin (born 22 August 1945) is a British singer-songwriter and radio producer, notable for his 1970s musical collaborations with Clive James and for producing the BBC Radio 4 series, &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Cambridge, England, Atkin attended Romsey County Primary School where he began to play the violin, and subsequently attended The Perse School. He taught himself piano and guitar. In 1959, he formed a church youth club band called &#x27;The Chevrons&#x27; for whom he played piano with four schoolfriends. He studied Classics and English at Cambridge University, where he was a member of St John&#x27;s College. In 1966 he joined Cambridge Footlights as a performer, writer and occasional music director, where he met future collaborators Julie Covington and Clive James.

==Music career==
Atkin made his first recording in 1967: a private pressing of 160 copies of &quot;While The Music Lasts&quot;, with vocals by Atkin and fellow Footlights alum Julie Covington and songs written by Atkin solo as well as with Clive James. Next year he was taken to EMI with Julie Covington to record the most popular number from the 1967 Revue Show: the complex &quot;Duet&quot;, which had appeared on his first album. At six minutes, it was too long to be a single and has never received commercial release; the tape has since been lost. Atkin released a second privately pressed album, consisting of 99 copies, in 1969. &quot;The Party&#x27;s Moving On&quot; featured performances by Atkin and Covington and songs co-written by James.

Essex Music funded the recording of fourteen Atkin/James tracks in 1969. The producer, Don Paul, was a friend of the disc jockey Kenny Everett, who played, amongst others, the song &quot;Master of the Revels.&quot; 

In 1970, Atkin, Covington and Dai Davies recorded a series of twelve 15-minute programmes edited by James for London Weekend Television. These shows, also called &quot;The Party&#x27;s Moving On&quot;, each featured three songs and were broadcast only in London late at night. They led to the commissioning of the larger revue format series &quot;What Are You Doing After The Show?&quot;. That year, Covington released several singles penned by Atkin and James, followed by the 1970 release of Atkin&#x27;s first album &quot;Beware of the Beautiful Stranger&quot;. In 1971, Covington released her first album, &quot;The Beautiful Changes&quot; with the majority of songs by Atkin and James.

Atkin did, and still does, write his own lyrics, but it was the collaboration with Clive James that produced his most famous songs. Atkin and James recorded six albums in the 1970s – the last four with RCA on which label the first two were also reissued. However, despite Atkin&#x27;s popularity on the college performance circuit the records did not sell in any great numbers. When singer Val Doonican recorded a cover version of the song &quot;The Flowers and the Wine&quot;, Atkin and James joked that the royalties from that alone exceeded the total from all album sales. For Atkin, touring provided a respectable but not luxurious income.

The release of the fourth album, &quot;The Road of Silk&quot; was accompanied by a promotional tour with a backing band, in contrast to Atkin&#x27;s usual solo tours. Despite the investment this implied, Atkin and James became increasingly dissatisfied with their handling by RCA. After the release of the next album &quot;Secret Drinker&quot; they had no wish to continue the relationship, and to fill their contractual obligations they concocted the album &quot;Live Libel&quot;, a collection of humour pieces which Atkin had used over the years to lighten the mood in concerts. Paradoxically this album resulted in their most successful tour to date, as James joined Atkin on stage for an evening of song, satire and poetry. James read from his epic poetic satire, &quot;The Fate of Felicity Fark in the Land of the Media&quot; while Atkin sang songs from the latest release and previous favourites.

To their dismay, the offers from other record labels did not flow in after the tour ended. Clive James returned to his blossoming career in television, while Atkin, after trying to make a living as a carpenter, responded to a &#x27;Situation Vacant&#x27; notice from the BBC, and thus embarked on the next phase of his career.

===Songs===
James&#x27; lyrics were far from mainstream popular music, being frequently dense with poetic references. At their most accessible they might describe the life of a machine tool shop supervisor, as in &quot;Carnations on the Roof&quot;. The song &quot;My Egoist&quot;, in contrast, is translated almost entirely from a poem by Guillaume Apollinaire. Other references include Rainer Maria Rilke&#x27;s &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; and William Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets.

Atkin&#x27;s musical settings drew most of their inspiration from Tin Pan Alley, although in the above-mentioned &quot;Carnations on the Roof&quot; he set a sombre description of a working class life to themes characteristic of Tamla Motown. Often Atkin turned James&#x27; intentions upside down, as with &quot;The Last Hill That Shows You All The Valley&quot;, which James wrote as a dirge but which Atkin set to a thumping, angry rock beat. The combination worked as James&#x27; mournful cataloguing of man&#x27;s inhumanity to man became a cry of protest.

A sonnet in French by Gérard de Nerval, &quot;&quot;El Desdichado&quot;, which begins &quot;Je suis le ténébreux, le veuf&quot;&quot; (roughly &quot;I am the shadowy man, the widower&quot;), inspired two separate lyrics by James, one of which was &quot;The Shadow and the Widower&quot;, an interior dialogue reflecting on a failed romance as a man wanders home through a sterile urban landscape. The same poem, coincidentally, was set to music and performed by Flanders and Swann. A detailed breakdown of the references within this song (and several others) can be found on Atkin&#x27;s website.

==Other work==
While James became a well-known television personality and Atkin a radio producer, their music catalogue went out of print until all six original albums were re-released on CD in the 1990s.

In 1976, Atkin&#x27;s recording contract with RCA expired and he concentrated on renovating his house and building furniture for other people. He also wrote columns on DIY for the UK environmentalist magazine &quot;Vole&quot;. Chris Parr of the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh commissioned Atkin to write a musical play for their Festival season in 1977. The result was &quot;A &amp; R&quot;, which was substantially re-written for a 1978 production by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Donmar Warehouse in London where it ran for six months in repertory.

In 1981, Atkin succeeded Griff Rhys Jones as BBC Radio Light Entertainment Producer. He subsequently became a Script Editor in 1983 and Chief Producer, Radio 4 in 1986. His productions included &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, &quot;My Word!&quot;, &quot;My Music&quot;, &quot;Week Ending&quot;, &quot;Legal, Decent, Honest and Truthful&quot; (written by Guy Jenkin and Jon Canter, and starring Martin Jarvis), &quot;After Henry&quot; (by Simon Brett with Prunella Scales, Joan Sanderson, Ben Whitrow, and Gerry Cowper), &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;, Christopher Lee&#x27;s &quot;The House&quot;, &quot;Flying The Flag&quot;, Peter Tinniswood&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Mort&#x27;s North Country&quot;, &quot;Jarvis&#x27;s Frayn&quot;, &quot;My Grandfather&quot;, Martin Jarvis reading Richmal Crompton&#x27;s &quot;Just William&quot; stories, and &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

Atkin moved to Bristol in 1989 to be Head of BBC Network Radio there. After four years in post, he became a freelance producer in 1993. His most notable freelance production is &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot; – a 216-part specially commissioned history of Britain, written by historian Christopher Lee and read by Anna Massey, Paul Eddington, Peter Jeffrey, and others (including Atkin himself under a pseudonym), recorded and broadcast over 14 months in 1995 and 1996. It was re-edited for release on ten BBC double cassettes and won the 1996 Talkie Award for best non-fiction, best design, and Talkie of the Year. Atkin also worked as script editor for Hat Trick Productions, as part of their sitcom and drama development team.

In 2005, Atkin provided the voice of Mr. Crock in the animated movie, &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;. He also received a &quot;special consultant&quot; credit for the movie &quot;Chicken Run&quot; (2000), which was created and produced by the same studios, Aardman Animations. Both Aardman and Pete Atkin are based in Bristol. Atkin also provided some additional voices in the 2009 film, &quot;Planet 51&quot;.

Atkin also worked as a voice director on the twelfth season/C.G.I. version of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;. Atkin has even worked on &quot;The Gruffalo&quot; films as a voice direction consultant.

==Revival==
In 2001, 2003 and 2005, Atkin and James undertook national tours of the UK talking about, reading and singing, their songs, poetry and prose. In 2003 the duo also toured Australia. Atkin has also performed from time to time in folk clubs solo and, more recently, with the pianist and arranger Simon Wallace.

This revival dates back to 1996 when Steve Birkill, an electronics entrepreneur and satellite television pioneer, approached Atkin at a concert and asked permission to create a website celebrating his work. Atkin provided background information for this, and it was supported by a mailing list. Birkill named the list &quot;Midnight Voices&quot; from the lyric of the song &quot;Payday Evening&quot;.

Birkill also invited Atkin to headline a local folk festival he supported in Monyash, Derbyshire. On the strength of Atkin&#x27;s performance and the response to it, and Atkin himself realising he still had a following, this was repeated the following year, with accompanying performance CD releases by subscription. The second show also featured a tribute band, a varying cast of amateur players under the rubric of &#x27;The Beautiful Changers&#x27;.

At the 2000 show, Atkin announced that the music conglomerate BMG, which had acquired the RCA catalogue and rights, had finally released the master recordings for the final four of his albums. They were subsequently re-released on CD in the same fashion as the first two, whose rights had been owned by a different company.

Atkin then recorded &quot;The Lakeside Sessions&quot; — a double CD of new recordings of some previously written but unrecorded Atkin/James songs. The CD &quot;Winter Spring&quot; is made up entirely of new material co-written with James. His next CD, &quot;Midnight Voices&quot;, made with Simon Wallace, consisted of reinterpretations of 15 songs originally recorded and released in the 1970s. The title is in part a tribute to the &quot;virtual and actual group of friends and aficionados&quot; who ran and contributed to the Midnight Voices discussion group.

In 2002, the electronic music outfit Lemon Jelly used a guitar sample from &quot;The Pearl Driller&quot; (from &quot;Driving Through Mythical America&quot; album) as part of the &quot;Nice Weather For Ducks&quot;.

&quot;The Colours Of The Night&quot;, a thirteen track album of new songs, released on 6 July 2015 on the Hillside Music label, is said to &quot;mark the final chapter in a songwriting partnership with Australian broadcaster and poet Clive James that has endured for almost fifty years&quot;. At the time of its release, James had been seriously ill with leukaemia for several years. He died in 2019.

Atkin lives in Bristol with his American wife, where he also performs as the piano/keyboard player in the Bristol-based band, The Shrinks. On 7 January 2016, Atkin was crossing the road in Bristol when he was hit in the face by a bus, suffering multiple injuries and subsequently losing the sight of one eye. However, he has since returned to performing.

In September 2023, Atkin released a second collaboration with Simon Wallace, &quot;The Luck of the Draw&quot;. The fourteen-track record included five songs from their 1970s records, two songs originally written for and recorded by Julie Covington, five from their recordings in the 2000s, including &quot;The Lakeside Sessions&quot; and &quot;Winter Spring&quot;, and two previously unreleased songs. 

The &quot;Midnight Voices&quot; mailing list has now been replaced by an online discussion forum with multiple subject areas.

<doc id="948312" wikidata="Q1344532" url="?curid=948312" title="Tomas Holmström">
<text>Bengt Tomas Holmström (; born 23 January 1973) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey left winger who played his entire National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Detroit Red Wings, with whom he won four Stanley Cup championships; in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2008.

During his playing career, Holmström was widely considered one of the NHL&#x27;s best at screening the opposition&#x27;s goaltender, as well as for his physical presence in front of the opposition&#x27;s net.

==Playing career==
Holmström was first noticed by Detroit Red Wings scout Håkan Andersson in 1993 during a Swedish national team selection camp, where Holmström missed the cut, then again the next year while playing with Boden, where his coach, Niklas Wikegård, told Andersson that Holmström was the team&#x27;s best player. He was then drafted 257th overall by Detroit in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft and began playing for the Red Wings in the 1996–97 season. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Holmström returned to Sweden to play for his old team, Luleå HF, in the Swedish top flight league, the Elitserien.

Holmström was inducted into the Piteå Wall of Fame in his hometown in 2006.

On 7 April 2007 Holmström scored his 30th goal of the 2006–07 season against the Chicago Blackhawks, reaching the 30-goal plateau in a season for the first time in his career.

Holmström scored 12 points during the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs as the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup for the fourth time in 11 years over the Pittsburgh Penguins. On his day with the Cup, he had his cousin&#x27;s daughter baptized in it.

During the 2009–10 season, Holmström was initially selected to play in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. A knee injury sustained on 13 February 2010, in a game against the Ottawa Senators, however, prevented him from playing in the tournament. It was announced the next day, 14 February, that he would be replaced by friend and Red Wing teammate Johan Franzén. The announcement came from Sweden Head Coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson. On 4 June 2010, during the season&#x27;s subsequent off-season, Holmström agreed on a two-year contract extension to remain in Detroit after an impressive season in which he scored 25 goals, second on the team only to sniper Pavel Datsyuk&#x27;s 27; Holmström also scored a team-high 13 goals on the power play.

On 12 February 2012 Holmström became only the sixth Red Wing and 272nd NHL player to play 1,000 games.

After the retirement of long-time Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström at the end of the 2011–12 season, Holmström became the last active player from the 1997 and 1998 Stanley Cup-winning Detroit teams to still be active with the team. However, he didn&#x27;t play a single game after Lidström announced his retirement.

On 22 January 2013 Holmström announced his retirement from professional hockey just hours before Detroit&#x27;s home opener at Joe Louis Arena against the Dallas Stars in the lockout-shortened season. , Holmström held the following records with the Red Wings: sixth in most regular season games played, fourth in playoff games played and 13th in points scored.

==Playing style==
During his playing career, Holmström was known for his presence in front of the opposition&#x27;s goal and his ability to screen the opposing team&#x27;s goaltender. Because he had to withstand teammates&#x27; shots towards goal, as well as efforts from opponents to vacate him from in front of the net, Holmström wore additional padding to protect his body. During a playoff series against the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2009, Detroit Head Coach Mike Babcock said of Holmström, &quot;I think there&#x27;s [defencemen] out there who think they might actually get to him. That&#x27;s just not possible.&quot;

Due to his obstructive playing style and close proximity to goalies and the crease, Holmström attained a reputation and was often charged with goaltender interference penalties as well as occasionally having goals called back because of his proximity to the goaltender&#x27;s crease. Holmström himself, as well as Red Wings TV announcers Mickey Redmond and Ken Daniels, often questioned the legitimacy of these calls by the on-ice officials.

Holmström was known to many fans in Detroit by the nickname of &quot;Homer.&quot; He acquired the nickname &quot;Demolition Man&quot; while playing in Sweden, where he was also called &quot;Holma.&quot;

==International play==



Holmström has participated in four international tournaments for Sweden:
*1996 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships
*2002 Winter Olympics
*2004 World Cup of Hockey
*2006 Winter Olympics

<doc id="948317" wikidata="Q1338888" url="?curid=948317" title="PC-8800 series">
<text>The , commonly shortened to PC-88, are a brand of Zilog Z80-based 8-bit home computers released by Nippon Electric Company (NEC) in 1981 and primarily sold in Japan.

The PC-8800 series sold extremely well and became one of the four major Japanese home computers of the 1980s, along with the Fujitsu FM-7, Sharp X1 and the MSX computers. It was later eclipsed by NEC&#x27;s 16-bit PC-9800 series, although it still maintained strong sales up until the early 1990s.

NEC&#x27;s American subsidiary, NEC Home Electronics (USA), marketed variations of the PC-8800 in the United States and Canada.

==History==
Nippon Electric&#x27;s Microcomputer Sales Section of the Electronic Device Sales Division launched the PC-8001 in September 1979, and by 1981 it consisted of 40% of the Japanese personal computer market. In April 1981, Nippon Electric decided to expand personal computer lines into three groups: New Nippon Electric, Information Processing Group and Electronic Devices Group, with each specializing in a particular series. The Microcomputer Sales Section was reformed to the Microcomputer and Application Division in June 1980, and was renamed to the Personal Computer Division in April 1981. At that time, Japanese personal computers were mostly used by hobbyists. The division introduced the PC-8801 in November 1981 and intended to expand the personal computer market into the business world.

The PC-8801 was capable of displaying Kanji characters via an optional Kanji ROM board. Various companies released Japanese word processor software for the machine, such as , , and . NEC themselves released which was a rebranded version of Yukara, but it was not a success. In addition to office software, companies like Enix and Koei released many popular games for the system, establishing the PC-8801 as a strong gaming platform. By November 1983, the PC-8801 had shipped 170,000 units. The PC-8801&#x27;s direct successor, the PC-8801mkII, came with a JIS level 1 kanji font ROM, a smaller case and keyboard, and, in the models 20 and 30, one or two internal 5-inch 2D floppy disk drives. This set of PC-8800 computers sold more units than the PC-9800 series at that time.

By December 1983, NEC had multiple personal computer lines coming out from different divisions. NEC&#x27;s Information Processing group had the PC-9800 series, and NEC Home Electronics had the PC-6000 series. To avoid competing with itself, NEC decided to consolidate their personal computer business into two divisions; the NEC Home Electronics division dealt with the 8-bit home computer line, and the Information Processing group dealt with the 16-bit personal computer line. The Electronic Device Sales division spun off personal computer business into NEC Home Electronics.

In March 1985, NEC Home Electronics introduced the PC-8801mkIISR, which had improved graphics and sound capabilities. A cost-reduced version, the PC-8801mkIIFR, shipped 60,000 units for half a year. Although the PC-9801VM shipments surpassed it, the PC-8800 series was still popular as a Japanese PC game platform until the early 1990s.

==Hardware==

=== Graphics ===
Throughout the lifetime of the PC-8800, there were four different graphics modes. They are as follows:

*N mode: PC-8000 series compatible graphic mode
*V1 mode: 640 × 200 8 colors, 640 × 400 2 colors
*V2 mode: 640 × 200 8 out of 512 colors, 640 × 400 2 out of 512 colors
*V3 mode: 640 × 200: 65536 colors, 640 × 400: 256 out of 65536 colors, 320 × 200: 65536 colors, 320 ×  400: 64 out of 65536 colors

No entry in the PC-8800 series was capable of displaying all four modes.

=== Sound ===
The early computers in the PC-8800 series use a simple internal speaker, like the Apple II and IBM PC, capable of generating beeps and clicks. Later models added FM-synthesis chips for much more elaborate audio.

==Software==
Companies that produced exclusive software for the NEC PC-8801 included Enix, Square, Sega, Nihon Falcom, Bandai, HAL Laboratory, ASCII, Pony Canyon, Technology and Entertainment Software, Wolf Team, Dempa, Champion Soft, Starcraft, Micro Cabin, PSK, and Bothtec. Certain games produced for the PC-8801 had a shared release with the MSX, such as those produced by Game Arts, ELF Corporation, and Konami. Many popular series first appeared on the NEC PC-8801, including &quot;Snatcher&quot;, &quot;Thexder&quot;, &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;RPG Maker&quot;, &quot;Sokoban&quot;, and &quot;Ys&quot;.

Nintendo licensed Hudson Soft to port some of Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer games for the platform, including &quot;Excitebike&quot;, &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;, &quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, and &quot;Ice Climber&quot;, as well as new editions of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; called &quot;Mario Bros. Special&quot; and &quot;Punch Ball Mario Bros.&quot;, a semi-sequel to &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot; titled &quot;Donkey Kong 3: Dai Gyakushū.&quot;

The computer also had its own BASIC dialect, N88-BASIC.

<doc id="948320" wikidata="Q5144886" url="?curid=948320" title="Colin Beyer">
<text>Colin Andrew Nielsen Beyer (10 September 1938 – 21 August 2015) was a New Zealand lawyer. He was a partner and then consultant with Simpson Grierson in Wellington. Also a prominent businessman with many governance positions, Beyer was a securities commissioner on the Securities Commission of New Zealand from 2001 until 2010. He was the stepfather of former Member of Parliament Georgina Beyer.

==Early life==
Of Danish descent, Beyer was born in Wellington on 10 September 1938 to Knud Johan Nielsen and Carla Emilie (née Pallesen) Beyer. His father worked on the wharves in Wellington and his mother worked for the Education Department. Together with his younger brother Trevor and his sister Olga, they lived in Island Bay. Both brothers attended Wellington College.

==Professional career==
Beyer was educated at Victoria University of Wellington. He graduated with an LLB and was admitted to the bar in 1962. His specialties are corporate law and mining law. He was a partner with Simpson Grierson for ten years until 2003, when he became a consultant (the term that Simpson Grierson uses for former partners). As of December 2010, Beyer is no longer listed on the Simpson Grierson website as a consultant.

Beyer was a prominent businessman with considerable governance experience. He was made a Distinguished Fellow of the Institute of Directors in 2006. He served as Chairman of the Accident Compensation Corporation, Government Property Services Ltd., Capital Properties New Zealand Ltd, Tower Ltd and Summit Resources Ltd, and a director of Capital Power Ltd and TrustPower Ltd. He was a ministerial appointee on the Wellington Area Health Board and the Wellington Polytechnic Board.

He was chairman of the Tower Corporation from 1990 until his resignation in 2003. The sacking of managing director James Boonzaier in 2002 under his chairmanship caused some controversy. Beyer was widely criticised in financial circles for publicly blaming Boonzaier for Tower&#x27;s poor financial performance, and Beyer&#x27;s decision not to stand for re-election prior to the 2003 AGM is described as having prevented the &quot;possibility of a humiliating defeat&quot;. Bruce Sheppard, the founder of the New Zealand Shareholder&#x27;s Association, criticised the board of Tower under Beyer&#x27;s chairmanship over the setting of directors&#x27; fees and the payment of retirement allowances. Sheppard described the practices of the board as &quot;the most outrageous gaming by the most reprehensible group&quot;.

Beyer was appointed to the Securities Commission in February 2001 for a four-year term. In early 2005, he was reappointed for a second five-year term by Commerce Minister Pete Hodgson. In 2009, Minister of Commerce Simon Power announced that Beyer would retire in February 2010, to be succeeded by Simon Botherway.

He was the Honorary Consul-General of Finland from 1993, and was by 2006 the Dean of the Consular Corps in Wellington. He was made a Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland.

==Political career==
In the 1970s, while living in Camborne, he spent some time on the Porirua City Council, first as an independent and later as a Labour Party representative. During his time as a Porirua city councillor Beyer was widely respected for his sound judgement and a broad knowledge and understanding of the complex range of issues the City was dealing with. He later moved to Kelburn.

==Family==
Beyer was married to Noeline Bertrand (née Tamati). Her first child, born 1957 as George Bertrand and later named Georgina Beyer, came to live with them after their marriage after having spent the previous years with her parents. Their son Andrew was born in December 1963. With marital problems developing, George was sent to Wellesley College boarding school, where he tried to commit suicide for feeling rejected by his parents. Colin Beyer separated from Noeline in 1971 and moved to Brooklyn, where he shared an apartment with Ron Brierley, whom he knew from Wellington College. He married Brazilian-born Anna and had two sons. He also gained custody of his son Andrew.

Georgina Beyer came out first to her stepfather, before telling her mother about her 1984 sex reassignment surgery. She achieved fame as the world&#x27;s first transsexual Member of Parliament.

==Death==
Colin Beyer died on 21 August 2015. His funeral was held at Old St. Paul&#x27;s, Mulgrave St, Wellington.

<text>Triumph Films (also known as Triumph Releasing Corporation) was an American independent film studio division of Sony Pictures Entertainment that geared towards theatre and direct-to-video film production and distribution.

==History==
It was founded in 1982 as a joint venture between Columbia Pictures and the French company Gaumont to distribute foreign films in the US. In 1984, Marcie Bloom, who was formerly of the New York Film Festival, joined Triumph Films to serve as New York publicity director (Bloom would later co-found Sony Pictures Classics).

In 1985, Triumph Films announced that they would cut back down on their production slate, focusing on foreign-language films with English subtitles. Shortly afterwards, Gaumont decided to cut ties, and Columbia Pictures, now the sole owner, decided to shutter Triumph Films, and fold it into the Columbia Pictures label.

On January 5, 1988, the then-newly founded Columbia Pictures Entertainment announced that they would revive the Triumph brand as a new worldwide subsidiary, Triumph Releasing Corporation; this incarnation of Triumph provided administrative services related to the distribution of Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures in the U.S. and Canada, while internationally, Triumph would be responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of Columbia and Tri-Star films under the direction of each individual studio. It was officially incorporated on March 24, 1988. In 1989, Triumph began to distribute films from Crédit Lyonnais&#x27;s Epic Productions Inc..

On November 23, 1994, Triumph Releasing Corporation was renamed as Sony Pictures Releasing Corporation, and the Triumph name was spun off as Triumph Films, now primarily a label for low-budget and direct-to-video releases. After being shut down in 1997, the Triumph Films label was re-activated in 2003. The label went dormant again, becoming an in-name-only division of Sony Pictures Releasing Corporation. In 2014, the label was revived yet again for the release of &quot;The Remaining&quot;. Their direct-to-video role has been taken by Destination Films within Sony.

==Notable films==
Notable films include &quot;To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday&quot;, &quot;The Ambulance&quot;, &quot;Brainscan&quot;, &quot;Magic in the Water&quot; (co-released by TriStar Pictures), &quot;The Golden Laws&quot;, &quot;Steamboy&quot; (co-distributed by Destination Films) and the critically panned &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="948327" wikidata="Q5149883" url="?curid=948327" title="Columbia TriStar Television">
<text>Columbia TriStar Television, Inc. (abbreviated as CTT) was an American television production and distribution company, which was active from 1994 until its reincorporation as Sony Pictures Television on 2002. It was the third iteration of what had originated as Columbia Pictures&#x27;s television studio, Screen Gems.

==History==
Columbia TriStar Television was launched on February 21, 1994, from the merger of Columbia Pictures Television and TriStar Television, under the leadership of Jon Feltheimer, who was president of TriStar Television from 1991 to 1994 and of New World Television until 1991. After the merger, Columbia Pictures Television Distribution was renamed Columbia TriStar Television Distribution, though most traces of the former name were not removed in full until the start of the 1995–96 television season. It officially subsumed Merv Griffin Enterprises on June 4, 1994 and took over the role of production of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; starting in September 1994, with both shows continuing to utilize King World for distribution, an arrangement that continued until 2025 under successor company CBS Media Ventures. In 1994, SPE acquired Stewart Television, which was known for the &quot;Pyramid&quot; franchise, to burnish the library for Sony&#x27;s Game Show Network, which would launch on December 1, 1994.

Its global subsidiary, Columbia TriStar International Television, distributed Sony&#x27;s programs outside North America, and was formed from Columbia Pictures International Television with TriStar International Television&#x27;s merger into one unit in 1992.

In 1995, Columbia TriStar Television established its children and family entertainment division with Sander Schwartz named as senior vice president of the unit.

On January 30, 1997, Sony streamlined its American domestic operations. On March 12, 1997, CTT signed a deal with Procter &amp; Gamble Productions (P&amp;G) to launch shows that P&amp;G products sponsor, after the original agreement with Paramount Television expired. On August 26, 1997, Addis-Wechsler inked a five-year joint venture agreement with the studio to produce all forms of its own television programming.

On July 1, 2000, Barry Thurston stepped down as president of Columbia TriStar Television Distribution after 17 years and was succeeded by then-current president, Steve Mosko. Thurston was originally president of Embassy Telecommunications in 1983.

On October 25, 2001, Sony combined the domestic network and syndication divisions (Columbia TriStar Television and Columbia TriStar Television Distribution, respectively) into one unit known as Columbia TriStar Domestic Television.

The start of the 2002–03 television season saw Sony Pictures Entertainment wind down the &quot;Columbia TriStar&quot; monicker permanently from active use, and the television divisions became Sony Pictures Television and Sony Pictures Television International officially on September 16, 2002 with that day&#x27;s season premieres of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;.

<doc id="948330" wikidata="Q172876" url="?curid=948330" title="Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours">
<text>Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours is a motor racing circuit located in central France, near the towns of Magny-Cours and Nevers, some from Paris and from Lyon.

It staged the Formula One French Grand Prix from 1991 (succeeding Circuit Paul Ricard) to 2008, and the 24-hour Bol d&#x27;Or motorcycle endurance events from 2000 to 2014 (succeeded by Circuit Paul Ricard). It hosted the French motorcycle Grand Prix in 1992, and the Superbike World Championship in 1991 and annually since 2003.

Magny-Cours has hosted several additional international championships, like the World Sportscar Championship, World Touring Car Championship, FIA GT Championship, World Series by Renault and Formula 3 Euroseries. Also, the FFSA GT Championship has visited the circuit since 1997.

A campus of the French engineering college Institut supérieur de l&#x27;automobile et des transports is also located on the circuit, as well as the museum Conservatoire de la monoplace française.

==History==

Commonly dubbed Magny-Cours, it was built in 1960 by Jean Bernigaud and was home to the prestigious Winfield racing school (École de Pilotage Winfield), which produced drivers such as François Cevert, Jacques Laffite and Didier Pironi. The circuit was opened on 7 August 1960. However, in the 1980s the track fell into disrepair and was not used for international motor racing until it was purchased by the Conseil Départemental de la Nièvre in 1986.

In the 1990s, the Ligier Formula One team and its successor Prost were based at the circuit and did much of their testing at Magny-Cours.

The circuit hosted the French Formula One Grand Prix from 1991 until 2008, and the Bol d&#x27;Or from 2000 until 2014.

The circuit was re-designed in 2003 and used for a wide range of events include various sports and commercial use. For the 2003 French Grand Prix, the final corner and chicane were changed in an effort to increase overtaking, with little effect.

Michael Schumacher was able to win the 2004 French Grand Prix using an unprecedented four-stop strategy.

In 2006, Michael Schumacher became the first driver ever to win any single Formula One Grand Prix a total of 8 times and at the same circuit.

Bernie Ecclestone originally confirmed that F1 would not return to Magny-Cours in 2008, instead moving to an alternative location possibly in Paris. However in a striking U-turn, it was revealed that the 2008 French Grand Prix would take place at Magny-Cours with the release of the official calendar in July 2007.

In May 2008, Ecclestone confirmed that Magny-Cours would stop hosting the French Grand Prix after the 2008 race, suggesting that he was looking into the possibility of hosting the French Grand Prix on the streets of Paris. The venue suffered from poor attendances due to its remote location, poor access and insufficient accommodation.

In June 2008, the provisional calendar for the 2009 season was released, and a French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours appeared on it, scheduled for 28 June. However, in October 2008 the 2009 French Grand Prix was cancelled after the French Motorsports Federation (FFSA) withdrew financing for the event. In 2009 the track hosted its first Superleague Formula event. It also hosted a second event in 2010.

The circuit was used as part of stage three of the 2014 Paris–Nice cycling race, with the peloton completing almost a full lap of the circuit – in the reverse direction to its motorsport use – before the finish on the front straight.

==The circuit==
The track nowadays is a smooth circuit with good facilities for the teams, although restricted access prevents spectators from reaching many parts of the circuit. Unusually, many corners are modelled on famous turns from other circuits, and are named after those circuits, i.e.. the fast Estoril corner (turn 3), the Adelaide hairpin (turn 5) and the Nürburgring and Imola chicanes (turns 7 and 12 respectively). It has a mix of slow hairpins and high-speed chicane sections which includes a long fast straight into the first-gear Adelaide hairpin, the best overtaking opportunity on the circuit. The circuit is very flat with negligible change in elevation (only a small valley at the Estoril corner and a slight hill near the Lycee corner).

The circuit provides few overtaking opportunities, despite modifications in 2003, which means the races here are commonly regarded as quite uneventful. Formula 1 races at Magny-Cours tend to have a processional nature, with most overtaking occurring during pit stop sequences.

More varied racing occurs when it rains, such as in the 1999 race, which was interrupted by a downpour. After a restart, most top contenders developed problems, which paved the way for Heinz-Harald Frentzen to claim a surprising victory in his Jordan.

Although the Bol d&#x27;Or 24-hour motorcycle endurance race was held at Magny-Cours for several years, it returned to the more popular Circuit Paul Ricard in 2015, which held the mentioned race before Magny-Cours.

==Lap records==

The official lap record for the current Grand Prix circuit layout is 1:15.377, set by Michael Schumacher during the 2004 French Grand Prix, while the unofficial all-time track record is 1:13.698, set by Fernando Alonso in the qualifying of aforementioned race. As of September 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours are listed as:

==Weather and climate==
The Nevers area has an oceanic climate that is still influenced by its far inland position. With a yearly precipitation of over on average, Magny-Cours is theoretically prone to rain affecting proceedings, although in the Formula One era, it often evaded the rainfall. There was one notable exception, when both the qualifying and the race of 1999 saw a fully wet track. With the Grand Prix being held in the middle of summer, tyre wear through high asphalt temperatures was possible. Magny-Cours&#x27; main event post-Grand Prix era, Superbike World Championship is being held in autumn and as a result sees colder temperatures.

<doc id="948332" wikidata="Q7783435" url="?curid=948332" title="Theseus and the Minotaur">
<text>Theseus and the Minotaur is a type of logic maze designed by Robert Abbott. In this maze, the player acts as Theseus, the king of Athens who is attempting to escape the Labyrinth. The main difference between this and the standard type of labyrinth, beyond the fact that it is set on a grid, is the fact that the maze is not empty, but also contains a Minotaur who hunts the player down, taking two steps for every one the player takes.

While the Minotaur is faster than the player, his moves are predictable and often inefficient: they are determined by checking to see if he can get closer to the player by moving horizontally, then checking to see if he can get any closer by moving vertically. If neither move would place him closer to the player, the Minotaur skips his turn. Theseus may also skip his turn.

This type of maze was first published in 1990 in Robert Abbott&#x27;s book &quot;Mad Mazes&quot;. The idea was later published in the British magazine &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot;.

<text>Columbia Pictures Television, Inc. (abbreviated as CPT) was launched on May 6, 1974, by Columbia Pictures as an American television production and distribution company. It is the second name of the Columbia Pictures&#x27; television division Screen Gems (SG) and the third name of Pioneer Telefilms. The company was active from 1974 until New Year&#x27;s Day 2001, when it was folded into Columbia TriStar Television (which is currently known as Sony Pictures Television), a merger between Columbia Pictures Television and TriStar Television. A separate entity of CPT continues to exist on paper as an intellectual property holder, and under the moniker &quot;CPT Holdings&quot; (the initials standing for Columbia Pictures Television) to hold the copyright for the TV show &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, as well as old incarnations from the company&#x27;s television library such as &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;

==History==

=== Screen Gems (1948–1974) ===
Screen Gems was a television production company that was owned by Columbia Pictures from 1948 to May 6, 1974, best known for shows like &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. It was one of the largest television producers in history, and it was around that time, one of the few TV subsidiaries of a major movie studio that didn&#x27;t carry the film studio&#x27;s name. It was highly profitable until 1974, when it was changed its name to Columbia Pictures Television.

===Re-incorporation as CPT and early years (1974–1982)===
The studio changed its name from Screen Gems to Columbia Pictures Television on May 6, 1974, and was suggested by David Gerber, who was producer on such CPT/Screen Gems shows, and now executive vice president of the studio, displacing Art Frankel when he was at Screen Gems. He announced plans to launch a separate unit to concentrate on movie-of-the-week titles. John H. Mitchell, who was president of the studio since 1958 when the studio was Screen Gems, said that they would take the division more closely to the parent company and to help achieve an interrelationship among all of its divisions.

As the successor in interest to Screen Gems, it assumed productions of the daytime soap operas &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, as well as the NBC police show &quot;Police Story&quot;. Its first produced series is the sitcom &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot; and was originally slated to be a Screen Gems production. Other new productions that were slated to be Screen Gems productions were &quot;Nakia&quot;, &quot;Born Free&quot; and &quot;Police Woman&quot;.

On May 27, 1974, Columbia Pictures Television planned to syndicate as early as 1975, ten one-hour musical specials that was set to be taped in Las Vegas nightclubs, and the programs will be simulcast on FM Radio to be set up by Yuri Zabran. In September 1974, Columbia had signed Abby Mann to develop long-form television projects, and the first project to came out of the deal was &quot;Medical Story&quot;.

In 1975, Carl Reiner joined Columbia Pictures Television to serve as executive producer and host of the show &quot;Good Heavens&quot;, which was for the ABC television network. Also, on July 1, 1975, former NBC vice president Larry White had set up his own production company Larry White Productions with a deal at Columbia Pictures Television. On May 10, 1976, White then joined the studio to displace Gerber as his program chief, who subsequently restarted plans to launch its own CPT-based production company.

On June 13, 1977, CPT acquired worldwide distribution rights to &quot;Barney Miller&quot; and &quot;Fish&quot; from Danny Arnold, Quinn Martin&#x27;s &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, and &quot;Soap&quot; from Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions. On June 27, CPT bought domestic distribution rights to four series made by Spelling-Goldberg Productions including &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and &quot;Family&quot; from Metromedia. Later on in 1977, former MGM Television president Harris Katleman and Universal Television producer Harve Bennett joined forces to form Bennett/Katleman Productions with a deal at the studio. Also in 1978, Larry White was then promoted to president of the studio.

From 1978 to 1986, CPT co-produced series with Spelling-Goldberg including &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, and &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;. On February 19, 1979, CPT acquired TOY Productions, whose output included &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; and &quot;Carter Country&quot;. In 1981, Richard Dawson has signed a joint development contract with Rastar Television and Columbia Pictures Television to produce TV shows. On August 13, 1981, CPT acquired the television assets of Time Life. A year later, Columbia (which Time-Life Television became a part of its sisters television company) joined with HBO and CBS to form TriStar Pictures.

On May 17, 1982, Columbia Pictures acquired Spelling-Goldberg Productions for more than $40 million. Around the same year, former ABC executive Barbara Corday started a new Columbia-affiliated production company Can&#x27;t Sing Can&#x27;t Dance Productions.

===The Coca-Cola Years (1982–1989)===
The 1980s brought significant changes to CPT. On June 22, 1982, beverage company The Coca-Cola Company bought Columbia Pictures for $750 million. In 1983, Coca-Cola formed CPT Holdings and demerged CPT from Columbia Pictures Industries in 1984 and transferred CPT to CPT Holdings. In 1983, actress Suzanne Somers through Hamel/Somers Productions had signed a deal with the studio. Also that same year that producer Roy Huggins struck a deal with the studio. Also that year, Columbia Pictures Television entered into an agreement with producer Centerpoint to co-produce two miniseries &quot;Sadat&quot; and &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;.

On January 30, 1984, CPT joined forces with Lexington Broadcast Services Company by creating a joint venture between the two companies called Colex Enterprises to distribute library shows such as &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; and &quot;The Monkees&quot;, while throughout the 1980s and 1990s, other shows such as &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; were licensed to The Program Exchange. The same year, CPT acquired distribution rights to &quot;Benson&quot;. In late 1984, Barbara Corday took over as president of the studio. Another high-profile deal at CPT arrived in August 1984 when two of the high-profile independent producers North Ave. Productions (backed by Michael S. Baser and Kim Weiskopf) signed with CPT after leaving 20th Century Fox Television (now 20th Television), while George Schenck and Frank Cardea through Schenck/Cardea Productions reupped its contract with CPT.

On June 18, 1985, Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio sold their company, Embassy Communications, Inc. (Embassy Pictures, Embassy Television, Tandem Productions, and Embassy Home Entertainment) to Coca-Cola. The company gained the rights to such shows as &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, among others. &quot;AITF&quot; at the time however, was still distributed by Viacom Enterprises but under license by Embassy. Coke also made plans to spin off Embassy Pictures and Embassy Home Entertainment. Under Coca-Cola&#x27;s ownership, Embassy saw success with &quot;227&quot; and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. The same year, Columbia and LBS Communications launched &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot; in first-run syndication. The show was a sequel to the 1970s ABC sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;. Also that year, Barney Rosenzweig via his The Rosenzweig Company banner had signed a three-year, distribution deal with the studio to distribute their own projects. During that year, the company revived the previous Screen Gems brand name to market classic television shows for syndication.

Major changes took place in 1986. On May 5, Coke acquired Merv Griffin Enterprises, producer of the popular series, &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, and the two game shows, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;; (the nighttime versions were distributed by King World, which is now handled by successor CBS Media Ventures). However, Sony Pictures Television handles off-net syndication reruns by broadcasting them on Game Show Network, while sister company Sony Pictures Home Entertainment owns DVD rights, though, as game shows, are unlikely to get a proper release). On May 21, 1986, Joe Indelli was resigned as president of Columbia Pictures Television Distribution, in order to launch a new company that was owned by MTM Enterprises to syndicate its own programs and Robert King, who was partner of The Television Program Source, would replace it as CPTD&#x27;s president of the studio.

Also in 1986, the former Lear units (Embassy Television, Embassy Telecommunications, and Tandem Productions) were merged to become Embassy Communications; the Tandem unit ceased production to be used after the cancellation of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; but remained in-name-only, while the Columbia and Embassy units continued to exist separately. Also on the same year on August 28, CPT acquired Danny Arnold&#x27;s Four D Productions, Inc. for $50 million. On November 24, 1986, Coca-Cola regrouped CPT, Embassy Communications, and Merv Griffin Enterprises into Coca-Cola Television, which was a division of the entertainment sector of The Coca-Cola Company, and Coke formed a new first-run syndication unit; Coca-Cola Telecommunications due to Coca-Cola merging the distribution unit of Columbia Pictures Television and The Television Program Source (a syndicator that was a joint venture between Alan Bennett, former King World president Robert King, and CPT that was created on October 15, 1984, which Coca-Cola had a small investment in originally, and notably distributed the 1985–1986 nighttime syndicated version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and was slated to distribute a new version of &quot;Match Game&quot; for syndication in 1987). It was headed by Gary Rosenthal, who was leading Embassy Telecommunications, and also inserted was a new subsidiary Coca-Cola Television Operations. On September 9, 1986, Columbia Pictures Television&#x27;s European division expanded its branch, producing programming for ITV franchisee holders, such as HTV, and added new co-productions from other ITV franchisees such as Anglia Television and Yorkshire Television.

Coca-Cola Telecommunications also took some programs that were or slated to be distributed under the Columbia Pictures Television banner including &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;, &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Dinosaucers&quot;, and &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; as well as taking the US distribution rights of &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot; from Colex. Columbia acquired the rights to &quot;Punky&quot;, a former NBC in-house production, because Financial Interest and Syndication Rules prevented the network from producing more episodes for syndication after they cancelled it. During the fall of 1986, the sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot; began a successful seven-year run on CBS. The same year, Tri-Star Pictures formed Tri-Star Television and produced the short-lived series &quot;Downtown&quot;. Tri-Star produced more series in 1987, &quot;Take Five&quot;, &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;, &quot;My Two Dads&quot;, &quot;Werewolf&quot;, and &quot;Buck James&quot;. Also that same year, Clyde Phillips joined the studio as an independent television producer.

In 1987, a major reorganization shook up at Columbia/Embassy Television, whereas Embassy employee Glenn Patrick resigned to start his own film and television production company, and Barbara Corday was appointed president at the organized studio. The Columbia name would now be used for dramatic shows, while the Embassy name would be used for comedic output. Owing to the association with Castle Rock Entertainment with the movie studio, CPT signed on to handle international distribution and off-net syndication of Castle Rock&#x27;s programs, because Columbia had a 40% interest in the studio.

====Columbia Pictures Entertainment (1987–1989)====
On December 21, 1987, Coca-Cola spun off their entertainment holdings and sold it to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. for $3.1 billion. Tri-Star was renamed as Columbia Pictures Entertainment (which they partially owned) after the film &quot;Ishtar&quot; turned out to be a notorious failure both critically and financially. CPT Holdings then became a stand-alone division from CPT.

In January 1988, Columbia/Embassy Television and Tri-Star Television were formed to create the new Columbia Pictures Television and Embassy Communications was reduced as in-name-only and was renamed as ELP Communications as the copyright holder for the shows by Embassy. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola Telecommunications and Embassy Communications (the distributor arm) were merged into the new Columbia Pictures Television Distribution. All shows in the era ended with the Columbia logo between 1988 and 1991.

As a result, many of the staff, including Barbara Corday, who had been as president of the studio since 1984 has been laid off, as well as former Coca-Cola Telecommunications presidents Herman Rush and Peter Seale, who had also been laid off and replaced mostly by Tri-Star alumnus, such as Scott Siegler, who was president of the studio, and former Columbia/Embassy executives were assigned to the new unit, namely Gary Lieberthal, who had the same title as Columbia/Embassy, would assume the position of the new CPT, and Barry Thurston, president of CET, will have the same title for the new CPT. Other executives retained by CPE were Arnold Mesnser, who was previously president of Tri-Star Telecommunications, who took over the responsibilities of Rush and Seale will have still have an unspecified corporate operation at CPE&#x27;s headquarters for the New York area, allowing Herman Rush and Peter Seale had plans to set up a new syndicated company to handle the former CCT product. On February 2, 1988, Barry Thurston; vice-president of Columbia/Embassy Television, became president of Columbia Pictures Television Distribution. On December 26, 1988, writer Pamela Pettler signed a deal with the studio.

On February 2, 1989, Columbia Pictures Television formed a joint-venture with Norman Lear&#x27;s Act III Communications called Act III Television to produce television series instead of managing.

===The Sony years to the end (1989–2001)===
On November 8, 1989, Sony bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion and the next day, Sony acquired The Guber-Peters Entertainment Company (formerly game show production company Barris Industries with the library of game shows including &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, and &quot;The Gong Show&quot;) for $200 million after hiring film producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters to run the company. On November 5, 1990, CPE folded its first-run syndication unit Guber-Peters Television into Columbia Pictures Television Distribution. On August 7, 1991, CPE changed its name to Sony Pictures Entertainment and TriStar Television was relaunched on October 10. That year, the company signed a deal with Brillstein-Grey Entertainment to distribute programming.

Throughout the 1990s, the studio launched such successful shows for Columbia such as &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot; on TLC and CBS in 1992, &quot;Ricki Lake&quot; in syndication which lasted 11 years, &quot;Party of Five&quot; on Fox, &quot;NewsRadio&quot; on NBC, and the short-lived cult following animated series &quot;The Critic&quot; on ABC and Fox in 1994, and for TriStar such as &quot;Mad About You&quot; on NBC in 1992, &quot;Forever Knight&quot; on CBS, first-run syndication, and USA in 1992, &quot;The Nanny&quot; on CBS in 1993, &quot;Malcolm &amp; Eddie&quot; on UPN in 1996, and &quot;Early Edition&quot; on CBS in 1996. One of the most successful by far was &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, a Castle Rock Entertainment production which Columbia distributed in off-net syndication years later.

On August 21, 1992, Columbia&#x27;s subsidiary CAT Holdings, Inc. (Columbia Act III Television) and Franklin/Waterman Entertainment created a joint venture called Franklin/Waterman 2. On December 7, 1992, SPE acquired the Barry &amp; Enright Productions game show library. In 1992, CPT has the potential by possibly going off-net syndication rights to a company backed by a joint venture between RHI Entertainment and Trilogy Entertainment Group. Later that year, director Jonathan Lynn had signed a deal with the studio to develop their own television projects, including an NBC series commitment.

On May 10, 1993, CPT and MCA TV formed their barter divisions. CPT&#x27;s barter division was called Columbia Pictures Television Advertising Sales (a.k.a. &quot;Columbia Television Advertising Sales&quot;). The sales division handled series by TriStar Television and Merv Griffin Enterprises; as well as off-net series by Castle Rock Entertainment, HBO Independent Productions, and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment. CPT used other companies such as Group W Productions for &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot;, MTV&#x27;s One World Entertainment for &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, and Tribune Entertainment for &quot;Designing Women&quot;. From 1994 until March 1996, the company distributed programming made by the CapCities/ABC-Brillstein-Grey joint venture Brillstein-Grey Communications until MCA purchased an investment made by the parent company.

====Merger with TriStar Television, restructuring, and expansion (1994–2001)====
On February 21, 1994, after takeover by Sony Pictures Entertainment, Columbia Pictures Television and TriStar Television merged under the leadership of Jon Feltheimer and the two combined studios became Columbia TriStar Television. After the merger, Columbia Pictures Television Distribution was renamed as Columbia TriStar Television Distribution.

During that year, SPE acquired a vast back catalog of independently produced game shows with the acquisition of Stewart Television. Along with the Merv Griffin, Chuck Barris, Barry &amp; Enright, and CPT game shows they had already owned, these were part of the basis of the Game Show Network, launched on December 1, 1994. In 1998, ELP Communications became an in-name unit of Columbia TriStar Television. In 1997, most new shows, as well as some existing CPT shows like &quot;Party of Five&quot;, dropped the CPT logo and begin putting the CTT logo in its place, and also in January 1997, changed monikers from Sony Television Entertainment to Columbia TriStar Television Group.

On July 1, 2000, Barry Thurston stepped down as president of Columbia TriStar Television Distribution after 17 years and was succeeded by then-current president, Steve Mosko. On January 1, 2001, Columbia Pictures Television officially dropped its separate logo and it was replaced by that of Columbia TriStar Television, with &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; being the last known show to feature the separate CPT logo, just in time when NBC started using split-screen credits. On October 25, 2001, CTT and CTTD merged to form Columbia TriStar Domestic Television.

On September 16, 2002, Sony Pictures changed the name of its television division to Sony Pictures Television.

<text>TriStar Television, Inc. (first spelled Tri-Star, and abbreviated as TT) was an American television production studio that was a division of Sony Pictures Television, a Sony Pictures Entertainment company. TriStar Television was launched in March 1986 by TriStar Pictures, and remained a joint-venture between Columbia Pictures, CBS, and HBO until it was acquired by Sony, the parent of both Columbia and TriStar. After a purchase by Sony Pictures Entertainment, both companies Columbia Pictures Television and TriStar Television merged and formed Columbia TriStar Television on February 21, 1994. The television studio was relaunched twice, most recently as a specialty label for Sony Pictures Television. The entity was originally a sister company of Columbia Pictures Television, which was shut down in 2001. Sony shut down this division again on May 31, 2024.

==History==
It was formed when Tri-Star Pictures joined forces with Stephen J. Cannell Productions and Witt/Thomas Productions and created a television distribution company called TeleVentures. Scott Siegler was immediately hired as president of the studio. As the Tri-Star Television studio rolled around, the company inked overall deals with various personnel, like Ron Samuels, Richard Leder, Michael Jacobs, Larry Tucker, Donald P. Bellisario, Jim Green and Larry Epstein to help develop projects for the studio and decided that they would be involved in various television movies.

By December 1987, Coca-Cola owned 80% Columbia Pictures Entertainment until January 1988, when it was reduced down to 49% and Tri-Star Television was then merged with Columbia/Embassy Television into the reorganized Columbia Pictures Television (CPT), although TeleVentures was retained to handle sales of the existing Tri-Star programs that were inherited under contract to CPT, which would continue as a separate sales and distribution company from the CPT unit. Scott remained president of the studio until he left in 1993. Columbia Pictures Entertainment was sold in November 1989 to Sony of Japan.

In late 1988, Witt/Thomas Productions withdrew from the TeleVentures venture, ceding it to Walt Disney Television, and sold its shares to Cannell. On July 11, 1990, both Tri-Star and Cannell dissolved the TeleVentures joint venture and Tri-Star sold its shares to Stephen J. Cannell Productions and TeleVentures became Cannell Distribution Co. Most of the series and the Tri-Star film packages that were distributed by TeleVentures were taken over by Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.

===Revival and merger with Columbia Pictures Television===
CPT would continue on under Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), but TriStar Television was reestablished in October 1991 after CPT acquired some of the library of New World Television. Jon Feltheimer, who was president of New World Television became the new president of TriStar Television. On March 15, 1993, star Larry Hagman had signed a deal with the studio to develop projects for the 1993-94 TV season. On February 21, 1994, TriStar Television merged with Columbia Pictures Television and formed Columbia TriStar Television (CTT). In 1997, most new shows, and some existing TriStar shows like &quot;Early Edition&quot;, shifted from TriStar Television to CTT, and also in January 1997, changed monikers from Sony Television Entertainment to Columbia TriStar Television Group.

When TriStar Television&#x27;s productions were folded into Columbia TriStar Television in 1999, &quot;Early Edition&quot; (a joint production with CBS) retained the TriStar copyright until 2000. The final season of &quot;Malcolm &amp; Eddie&quot; was later produced by CTT and TriStar Television operated in-name-only. On October 25, 2001, Columbia TriStar Television and Columbia TriStar Television Distribution merged to become Columbia TriStar Domestic Television. On September 16, 2002, SPE retired the Columbia and TriStar names from television, renaming CTDT as Sony Pictures Television.

===Second revival===
On May 28, 2015, TriStar Television was re-launched as a boutique production label for Sony Pictures Television. Until her death in March 2018, TriStar Television was run by Suzanne Patmore-Gibbs after being in-name-only for 15 years. The first new series was &quot;Good Girls Revolt&quot; and was piloted for Amazon Prime Video on November 5, 2015.

===Shutdown===
On May 31, 2024, Sony announced they are shutting down its TriStar Television boutique label and was folded into its drama department. The move was announced after the departures of Nicole Norwood and Jennifer Turner. Newer projects in development were taken over by Sony Pictures Television.

<doc id="948337" wikidata="Q3589" url="?curid=948337" title="The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)">
<text>The Manchurian Candidate is a 2004 American neo-noir psychological political 
thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme. The film, based on Richard Condon&#x27;s 1959 novel of the same name and a reworking of the previous 1962 film, stars Denzel Washington as Bennett Marco, a tenacious, virtuous soldier; Liev Schreiber as Raymond Shaw, a U.S. Representative from New York, manipulated into becoming a vice-presidential candidate; Jon Voight as U.S. Senator Tom Jordan, a challenger for vice president; and Meryl Streep as Eleanor Prentiss Shaw, also a U.S. Senator and Raymond&#x27;s manipulative ruthless mother.

While the name of the novel and the earlier film was retained, the significance of &quot;Manchurian&quot; was changed. In the original, the protagonist was captured in the Korean War and brainwashed by the Chinese army in Manchuria. In the 2004 film, with the Korean War replaced by the Gulf War, &quot;Manchurian&quot; is instead used as the name of a sinister multinational company.

==Plot==
Major Bennett Marco commanded a U.S. Army unit during the Gulf War in 1991. His unit&#x27;s member Sergeant First Class Raymond Shaw was awarded the Medal of Honor for single-handedly engaging the enemy during their ambushed reconnaissance patrol in Kuwait and leading all but two men of the patrol to safety over three days through the desert. Shaw is now a U.S. congressman. His ruthless mother, Virginia Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw, uses her influence to secure his nomination as the vice-presidential candidate over the favorite, Senator Tom Jordan. Shaw is aloof and somewhat reserved, but opens up to his mother, although he still resents her role in the break-up of the relationship with his childhood sweetheart Jocelyn, Senator Jordan&#x27;s daughter, prior to his enlistment.

Al Melvin, one of Marco&#x27;s former soldiers, tells Marco of his confusing memories and dreams about their ambushed patrol. Though clearly mentally ill, he shows Marco his drawings of images from his dreams. Marco also begins to have dreams about that mission, in which he and the rest of the patrol are captured, tortured and brainwashed.

Marco starts investigating what really happened. He travels to New York City: on the train he meets an outgoing supermarket clerk named Rosie who had already identified him. She offers him a place to stay in New York. While showering at her apartment, Marco feels a small lump on his upper back. He uses a knife to dig at the spot, and pulls out a tiny metallic object from under his skin, but accidentally drops it down the bathroom sink after Rosie, having listened to Marco&#x27;s subtle sounds of distress, forces her way inside.

Marco confronts Shaw at campaign headquarters, and during their joint lunch, wrestles him down, biting into Shaw&#x27;s back to remove an implant he suspects to be there. Marco is arrested but is subsequently released when Shaw decides not to press charges. Back at Rosie&#x27;s apartment Marco recovers Shaw&#x27;s implant which he had removed and kept hidden in his mouth during his detention. Marco has Shaw&#x27;s implant analysed by his friend Delp, who surmises that the implant&#x27;s purpose was storage of emergency medical data, but also recollects that there was a parallel project for various kinds of implantables funded by Manchurian Global, a powerful private equity firm with major political connections, including Senator Eleanor Shaw. After Delp administers electro-convulsive therapy with methohexital to Marco at his request, Marco begins to have clearer recollections that he was brainwashed during the ambushed mission and that he and Shaw were forced to kill the two missing soldiers from his patrol. He begins to suspect that he&#x27;s under surveillance and finds in Rosie&#x27;s handbag microcassettes with a file of information about him. The tapes turn out to contain recordings of his conversations with Rosie.

His research on Manchurian Global in the public library leads him to the name of Dr. Atticus Noyle, the South African geneticist accused of human experimentation on political prisoners during Apartheid and involved in scientific research with novel memory implants for Manchurian Global. He brings his findings to Senator Jordan, who confronts the Shaws with clear connections between Dr. Noyle&#x27;s work on deep implant behaviour modification under a research grant from Manchurian Global during Desert Storm, Marco and Shaw&#x27;s patrol missing for three days in the desert, and subsequent dreams and recollections of the patrol&#x27;s members; he suggests that Shaw withdraw from the campaign. Instead, Eleanor &quot;activates&quot; Shaw and orders him to kill Jordan. Jocelyn is also killed when she tries to stop Shaw.

When Marco confronts Rosie, she reveals she works for the FBI and has been following him undercover. Having found an implant in Melvin, who, like all other members of Shaw and Marco&#x27;s patrol, died mysteriously, the FBI arranges a meeting between Marco and Shaw to convince them they were brainwashed under an assassination plot, which takes place just as Governor Arthur and Shaw win the White House. Shaw receives a phone call intended for Marco from Eleanor, and by using trigger words, she gives Marco the command to assassinate the President-elect so that Shaw becomes President, and admits that she voluntarily gave him to the brainwashers for the country&#x27;s benefit; Shaw resists the mind-control techniques, empowered by Jocelyn&#x27;s death.

At the climactic moment, Shaw deliberately places himself between the entranced Marco and the President-elect. As Rosie rushes through the crowd to find Marco, Shaw looks at the vent where Marco is hiding and nods as a signal to kill him and his mother. Shaw dances with his mother and steers them into the marked position, where Marco kills them both with a single rifle shot. Marco prepares to kill himself, but after seeing Shaw&#x27;s nod, Rosie arrives and prevents his suicide by wounding him.

The FBI frames a deceased Manchurian Global contractor as the shooter. Manchurian executives watch in defeat as their entire conspiracy is revealed on television. Rosie takes Marco to the remote island compound where he was conditioned. After reflecting on his time there, Marco drops a photo of his Army unit and Shaw&#x27;s Medal of Honor into the sea.

==Cast==

In addition, cameos include: director Sidney Lumet as a political pundit, director Roger Corman as the Secretary of State, actor and future US Senator (2009–2018) Al Franken as a reporter, and president of the Authors Guild Roy Blount Jr. as a political pundit.

==Production==
Tina Sinatra was a co-producer of the film. Her father Frank Sinatra portrayed Marco in the original 1962 film and owned that film&#x27;s legal distribution rights into the late 1980s, never re-releasing it during that time (although it did air on network television several times). In the original, nationally released during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the premise was based on communists taking control; in this remake, big corporate influence serves as the evil faction, a twist to maintain the &quot;Manchurian connection&quot;. The remake does not follow the original film&#x27;s plot details on several occasions.

The film&#x27;s Persian Gulf War scenes were filmed in New Jersey.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; grossed $66.0million domestically (United States and Canada) and $30.1million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $96.1million, against a production budget of $80million. Released Jul 30, 2004, it opened at No. 3 and spent its first four weeks in the Top 10 at the domestic box office.

===Critical response===

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote of Streep, &quot;No one can talk about the acting in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; without rhapsodizing about Streep (in the role originated by Angela Lansbury). She has the Hillary hair and the Karen Hughes attack-dog energy, but the charm, the inspiration, and the constant invention are her own. She gives us a senator who&#x27;s a monomaniac, a mad mommy and master politician rolled into one, a woman firing on so many levels that no one can keep up – someone who loves being evil as much as Streep loves acting. She&#x27;s a pleasure to watch and to marvel at every second she&#x27;s onscreen.&quot;

<text>Antony John Green (born 2 March 1960) is an Australian psephologist and commentator. He is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s chief election analyst.

==Early years and background==
Born in Warrington, Lancashire, in northern England, Green emigrated to Australia with his family in 1964. He attended James Ruse Agricultural High School in Sydney, graduating in 1977. Green graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and computing, and a Bachelor of Economics with honours in politics from the University of Sydney. He worked initially as a data analyst in the computing industry and for a polling company before joining the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1989. Green recalls he saw an ad for a six-month position as an ABC election researcher and applied, along with 150 other applicants. His experience and his “slightly bubbly personality” helped him get the position. ABC producer Ian Carroll and journalist Kerry O’Brien recommended he stay on and he remains with the ABC until today.

==Career==
Green first appeared on the ABC&#x27;s election-night television coverage in the 1991 New South Wales election, following with the federal election in 1993.

, he had analysed over 70Australian elections at the territory, state and federal level for the ABC, starting with the 1989 Queensland state election to the 2024 Queensland state election. He designed the computer system that he uses to display and predict election results based on automated result feeds from Australia&#x27;s electoral commissions.

Green has also worked on elections from as far afield as Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for the ABC.

As the ABC&#x27;s Chief Election Analyst, Green is responsible for the content of its election website. He also has editorial responsibility for its data analysis and for their election-night results service. He is considered &quot;the face of election night coverage&quot;.

In time for the 2013 federal election campaign, Green helped introduce the voter engagement tool Vote Compass to the ABC website. It enables voters to gauge how their views align with candidates based on parties&#x27; statements on issues and also provides Green and other analysts a dataset larger than traditional opinion polls. Green also writes a comprehensive blog on electoral matters.

Green has said that he tends not to do campaign commentary and that he,
In a 2015 interview, he explained that some of the work in preparation for his election night coverage can start years earlier—including building up the database with candidates, polling places and past results and calculating the impact of redistributions. He also recounted the realisation of his recurring nightmare of the power outage during the on air coverage of the 2010 Victorian state election.

In addition to analysing and commenting on elections for the ABC, Green writes election analysis for third-party media outlets such as &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;Crikey&quot; and has appeared before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Australian Parliament urging reform of the ticket voting system used in Australian Senate elections.

In February 2025, Green announced he would retire from broadcasting following the federal election later that year. Stating that he would be 68 by the time the next federal election would be expected, Green said he did not feel &quot;as sharp and quick as I was&quot;, and that he would prefer to retire than stay &quot;too long&quot;.

==Honours==
In 2014, the University of Sydney recognised Green with an Honorary Doctor of Letters. This was followed in 2015 by appointment as an adjunct professor in Sydney University&#x27;s Department of Government and International Relations, recognising Green&#x27;s work in the study of elections. In the Australian 2017 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, Green was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO)
==Personal life==
Green is an avid cyclist, taking long-distance biking trips mostly in Australia and Europe. He is also an ambassador for the Sydney Swans football club, a team in the AFL.

==In popular culture==
Green&#x27;s contribution to political analysis was celebrated in the song &quot;Antony Green&quot; in the musical &quot;Keating!&quot;, where he was represented as an animated character.

<text>The North American X-10 (originally designated RTV-A-5) is an unmanned technology demonstrator developed by North American Aviation. It was a subscale reusable design that included many of the design features of the SM-64 Navaho missile. The X-10 was similar to the development of the Bell X-9 Shrike project, which was based on features of the GAM-63 RASCAL.

==Development==

To facilitate development of the long-range Navaho surface-to-surface cruise missile, North American Aviation (NAA) developed the RTV-A-5 (Research Test Vehicle, Air Force), or X-10 in 1951. This vehicle was to prove critical flight technology for the design of the Navaho cruise missile. These included proving the basic aerodynamics to Mach 2, flight testing the inertial guidance unit and flight control avionics to the same speed, and validate the recovery system for the next phase in the Navaho program. Preliminary design of the X-10 was completed in February 1951 and the first vehicle was delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in May 1953. The first flight occurred on 14 October 1953.

The X-10 was powered by two Westinghouse J40 turbojet engines with afterburners, and equipped with landing gear for conventional take off and landing. The combination of a delta wing with an all-moving canard gave it extremely good aerodynamics in the transonic and supersonic environments. It also made the vehicle unstable requiring active computer flight control in the form of an autopilot. Thus, the X-10 is similar to modern military fighters which are flown by the onboard computer and not directly by the pilot. Though the X-10 was receiving directional commands from a radio-command guidance system, these commands were sent through the on-board computer which implemented the commands. Later X-10s included an N-6 inertial navigation system which completely controlled the vehicle through the cruise portion of the flight.

==Operational history==

At the time it entered service, the X-10 was one of the fastest turbojet-powered aircraft flown. From 1953 to 1955 a total of five X-10s flew 15 flights at Edwards AFB. There it reached a maximum flight speed of Mach 1.84, flew a distance of , and reached an altitude of . These were performance levels superior to nearly all manned turbojet aircraft (the exception being the YF-104 Starfighter). In 1955 the program moved to Cape Canaveral, Florida, to complete the test program. Here a new set of six X-10 vehicles completed the testing of the N-6 inertial navigation system at supersonic speeds, reach altitude, a total flight distance of and a peak speed of Mach 2.05.

===Disposition===
Of all the X-10s built, only one survived the test program: serial 51-9307, the first X-10 to fly. Of the other four aircraft that flew at Edwards AFB, one exploded on takeoff, one was lost in flight, and the remaining two were destroyed in landing accidents. As for the vehicles flown at Cape Canaveral, three were expended in planned dive-in flights against Grand Bahama Island, and two were lost in landing accidents.

In 1958, the remaining three Cape Canaveral X-10s were selected for use as high speed targets for the BOMARC surface-to-air missile. The plan was to recover and reuse the X-10, not to have them shot down by the BOMARC. None of these vehicles completed their target flight: two were lost when landing and the third suffered a mechanical problem forcing it to be flown into the Atlantic.

==Surviving aircraft==
The sole surviving X-10 s/n GM 19307 is located at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. This was the first X-10 to fly. The aircraft was delivered to the Air Force Museum in 1957, upon completion of the program. It is displayed in the museum&#x27;s Research &amp; Development Hangar.

==Notable appearances in media==
The 1960s series &quot;Men Into Space&quot; used footage of the X-10 and SM-64 Navaho tests at Edwards AFB to depict spacecraft landings on a desert runway.

<doc id="948376" wikidata="Q1155472" url="?curid=948376" title="8 mm video format">
<text>The 8mm video format refers informally to three related videocassette formats. These are the original Video8 format (analog video and analog audio but with provision for digital audio), its improved variant Hi8, as well as a more recent digital recording format [[Digital8]]. Their user base consisted mainly of amateur camcorder users, although they also saw important use in the professional television production field.

In 1982, five companies – Sony, Matsushita (now Panasonic), JVC, Hitachi, and Philips – created a preliminary draft of the unified format and invited members of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, the Magnetic Tape Industry Association, the Japan Camera Industry Association and other related associations to participate. As a result, a consortium of 127 companies endorsed 8-mm video format in April 1984.

In January 1984, Eastman Kodak announced the new technology in the U.S. In 1985, Sony of Japan introduced the Handycam, one of the first Video8 cameras with commercial success. Much smaller than the competition&#x27;s VHS and Betamax video cameras, Video8 became very popular in the consumer camcorder market.

Video8 was launched in 1984, into a market dominated by the VHS-C and Betamax formats. The first two models were the Kodak Kodavision 2200 and 2400, both over US$1,500. The Kodak machines were produced by Matsushita Electric, but Matsushita itself had shown no interest in selling the same product under its own name.

The first Sony camcorder capable of recording to standard 8mm videotape was the Sony CCD-V8, with 6x zoom but only manual focus, released in 1985 with an MSRP of approximately $1,175, and a mass of . The same year, Sony released the CCD-V8AF which added autofocus. Also in 1985, Sony released the first of their compact Handycam range: the CCD-M8, which at one kilogram was half the mass of the CCD-V8, though it had no zoom and supported only manual focus with three focus settings.

In April 1986 six Japanese electronics companies—Matsushita, Hitachi, Pentax, Minolta, Mitsubishi, Sharp and Toshiba—announced their lack of plans to embrace eight millimeter in the foreseeable future and instead adopted VHS-C format. Yet, several months later at the summer 1986 Consumer Electronics Show Olympus introduced an eight-millimeter camcorder manufactured by Matsushita, and Hitachi was reported to be making eight-millimeter machines for Minolta &amp; Pentax.

In terms of video quality, Video8 offers similar performance to Beta-II and VHS in their standard-play modes. 

In terms of audio, Video8 generally outperforms its older rivals. Audio on Standard VHS and Beta is recorded along a narrow linear track at the edge of the tape, where it is vulnerable to damage. Coupled with the slow horizontal tape speed, the sound was comparable with that of a low-quality audio cassette. By contrast, all Video8 machines used audio frequency modulation (AFM) to record sound along the same helical tape path as that of the video signal. This meant that Video8&#x27;s standard audio was of a far higher quality than that of its rivals. Early Video8 camcorders used mono AFM sound, but this was later made stereo. This cost less than including 8mm&#x27;s optional digital stereo audio track. Linear audio did have the advantage that (unlike either AFM system) it could be re-recorded without disturbing the video, doing this in 8mm required a deck that supported digital audio. 

The small size of media means that many Video8 camcorders are small enough to hold in the palm of the user&#x27;s hand. This was impossible with Betamax and full-sized VHS camcorders, with all of them having shoulder-mount form factor. 

Video8 also has an advantage in terms of recording and playback time over VHS-C – 180 minutes vs 45 minutes in SP mode for standard cassettes for each format.

Video8/Hi8&#x27;s main drawback is that tapes made with Video8 camcorders cannot be played on VHS hardware. Instead it was assumed that the camcorder would be directly plugged into one&#x27;s TV. Although it is possible to transfer tapes (using the VCR to rerecord the source video as it is played back by the camcorder), the VHS copy would lose some quality compared to the 8mm original. During the 1990s Sony did market a few VHS VCRs that also feature an 8mm deck to allow convenient transfer to VHS. GoldStar also made a similar dual-deck machine. 

Ultimately, Video8&#x27;s main rival in the camcorder market turned out to be VHS-C, with neither dominating the market completely. However, both formats (along with their improved descendants, Hi8 and S-VHS-C) were nevertheless very successful. Collectively, they dominated the camcorder market for almost two decades before they were eventually crowded out by digital formats, such as MiniDV, 8cm DVD.

=== Hi8 ===


To counter the Super-VHS format, Sony introduced Video Hi8 (short for high-band Video8). First demonstrated in February 1989, it was initially endorsed by ten other manufacturers — Aiwa, Canon, Fuji, Hitachi, Konica, Matsushita, Maxell, Ricoh, Sanyo and TDK, which were joined later by Nikon, Samsung, Sharp and TEAC.

Similar to S-VHS, Hi8 used improved recorder electronics and media formulation to increase the recorded bandwidth of the luminance signal. The luminance carrier was shifted from 4.2 MHz for regular 8-mm up to 5.7 MHz for Hi8, and the frequency deviation was increased to 2 MHz from the 1.2 MHz of standard 8-mm.

Like S-VHS, Hi8 was officially rated at a luminance resolution of 400 lines, a vast improvement from their respective base formats and are roughly equal to LaserDisc quality. Chrominance resolution remained unchanged.

Sony retained monaural AFM and stereo digital PCM audio in its initial offerings, while Canon introduced HiFi AFM Stereo with the A1. HiFi AFM Stereo improved the original AFM audio format, making it stereo; it was also cheaper than digital PCM. Sony accepted HiFi AFM Stereo for its future mid-range models and relegated digital PCM audio to top of the line camcorders and VCRs.

All Hi8 equipment can record and play the standard 8-mm video. The reverse is not usually the case though a few late-entry 8-mm systems recognize and play Hi8 recordings.

=== PCM Multi Audio ===
The Sony EV-S900 (Hi8), Sony EV-S800, Sony EV-S700U, and Pioneer VE-D77 (Video8) all support a mode called &quot;PCM Multi Audio Recording&quot;. While other 8mm decks support only a single stereo PCM recording, these units provide five additional stereo PCM tracks that are recorded in the video area of the signal. This allows 8mm tapes to hold 6 parallel tracks of audio, each up to 4 hours long (in LP mode). Only one stereo track can be recorded or listened to at a time, and tracks are selected with the &quot;PCM Multi Audio&quot; selector button.

=== Digital8 ===


Introduced in 1999, &quot;Digital8&quot; is a form of the industry standard DV codec, recorded on Hi8 media. In engineering terms, Digital8 and MiniDV are indistinguishable at the logical format level. To store the digitally encoded audio/video on a standard NTSC Video8 cassette, the tape must be run at double the Hi8 speed. Thus, a 120-minute NTSC Hi8 tape yields 60 minutes of Digital8 video. Most Digital8 units offer an LP mode, which increases the recording time on an NTSC P6-120 tape to 90 minutes.

For PAL, the Digital8 recorder runs 1½ times faster; thus, a 90-minute PAL Hi8 tape yields 60 minutes of Digital8 video. PAL LP mode returns the tape speed to the Hi8 SP speed, so a Hi8 90-minute tape yields 90 minutes of Digital8 video.

Sony has licensed Digital8 technology to at least one other firm (Hitachi), which marketed a few models for a while; but by 2005 only Sony sold Digital8 consumer equipment. Digital8&#x27;s main rival is the consumer MiniDV format, which uses narrower tape and a correspondingly smaller cassette shell. Since both technologies share the same logical audio/video format, Digital8 can theoretically equal MiniDV or even DVCAM in A/V performance. But by the year 2005, Digital8 had been relegated to the entry-level camcorder market.

Digital8 recordings are not interchangeable with analog recordings, although many models of Digital8 equipment are able to play Hi8/Video8 analog recordings.

=== Decline ===
By 2009, the popularity of the analog 8mm formats had dwindled considerably and new camcorders that support the format were unobtainable, having been superseded by digital formats, mainly MiniDV and 8 cm DVD. These in turn have been largely displaced by high-definition camcorders that record to flash storage cards. Both Video8 and Hi8 blank media remain available and affordable but are increasingly rare. Tape-based camcorders are still readily available in the secondhand market. The last Hi8 camcorder (the Sony CCD-TRV238) and the last Digital8 camcorder (the Sony DCR-TRV280 (NTSC) / DCR-TRV285 (PAL)) were both discontinued in 2007, ending the 8mm format&#x27;s 22 years on the market.

== Design ==

The three formats are physically very similar, featuring both the same magnetic tape width and near-identical cassette shells, measuring 95 × 62.5 × 15 mm. This gives a measure of backward compatibility in some cases. One difference between them is in the quality of the tape itself, but the main differences lie in the encoding of the video when it is recorded onto the tape.

Video8 was the earliest of the three formats, and is entirely analog. (Excluding the optional digital PCM audio.) The 8mm tape width was chosen as smaller successor to the 12mm Betamax format, using similar technology (including U-shaped tape loading) but in a smaller configuration in response to the small configuration VHS-C compact camcorders introduced by the competition. It was followed by Hi8, a version with improved resolution. 

Digital8 is the most recent 8mm video format. It retains the same physical cassette shell as its predecessors, and can even record onto Video8 (not recommended) or Hi8 cassettes. However, the format in which video is encoded and stored on the tape itself is the entirely digital DV format (and thus very different from the analog Video8 and Hi8). Some Digital8 camcorders support Video8 and Hi8 with analog sound (for playback only), but this is not required by the Digital8 specification.

In all three cases, a length of 8mm-wide magnetic tape is wound between two spools and contained within a hard-shell cassette. These cassettes share similar size and appearance with the audio cassette, but their mechanical operation is far closer to that of VHS or Betamax videocassettes. Standard recording time is up to 90 minutes for PAL and 120 minutes for NTSC. These times are doubled for Long Play (LP) recording mode. (The cassette holds the same length tape; tape consumption is different between PAL and NTSC recorders.) Longer tapes were available, but were less common. 

Like most other videocassette systems, Video8 uses a helical-scan head drum (it having a small 40mm head) to read from and write to the magnetic tape. The drum rotates at high speed (one or two rotations per picture frame—about 1800 or 3600 rpm for NTSC, and 1500 or 3000 rpm for PAL) while the tape is pulled along the drum&#x27;s path. Because the tape and drum are oriented at a slight angular offset, the recording tracks are laid down as parallel diagonal stripes on the tape.

The heads on the drum of a Video8 recorder move across the tape at (a writing speed of) 3.75 meters per second.

Unlike preceding systems, 8mm did not use a control track on the tape to facilitate the head following the diagonal tracks. Instead 8mm recorded a sequence of four sine waves on each video track such that adjacent tracks would produce one of two heterodyne frequencies if the head mistracked. The system automatically adjusted the tracking such that the two frequencies produced were of equal magnitude. This system was derived from the dynamic track following (DTF) used by the Philips Video 2000 system. Sony rechristened the system as automatic track following (ATF) as the 8mm system lacked the ability of the heads to physically move within the head drum.

The main disadvantage of the ATF system was that unlike in the case of a control track, an 8mm camera or player cannot keep track of where the tape is during fast forward and rewind (though it could during shuttle search). This made editing using a linear editing system problematic. Some later cameras and players attempted to derive the tape position from the differential rotation of the spools with limited success.

=== Tape and recording protection ===
As with many other video cassette formats, 8mm videocassettes have a tape-protecting mechanism built into the shell. Unlike the ones on VHS and VHS-C shells, which consist of only a single piece of plastic that protects the part of the tape that is read by the player/recorder, Hi8&#x27;s tape-protection mechanism consists of two pieces of plastic at the top of the shell that come together and form a casing that protects both sides of the tape, and a latch that prevents this casing from opening and exposing the tape. The playback/recording unit can depress this latch to open the casing and gain access to the tape.

To prevent the recording on the tape from being erased, there is a small write-protect tab that can be moved to one of two positions, labeled &quot;REC&quot; and &quot;SAVE&quot; (sometimes marked as &quot;ERASE ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;, respectively). Comparing the sliding tab to a door, the tape is in the &quot;REC&quot; position when the &quot;door&quot; is open and in the &quot;SAVE&quot; position when it is closed. (Not all tape cases have markings for this information.) The tape can only be recorded onto (or recorded over) when this tab is in the &quot;REC&quot; position. This is an improved version of the VHS write-protect tab, which prevents erasure after it has been broken off, requiring covering with adhesive tape or filling with an obstruction to remove the write protection.

== Non-camcorder use ==

=== Home market ===
Efforts were made to expand Video8 from only the camcorder market into mainstream home video. But as a replacement for full-size VCRs, Video8 failed. It lacks the long (5+ hours) recording times of both VHS and Betamax, offers no clear audio/video improvement, and cost more than equivalent full-size VCRs. Even with all of the advanced features offered in high-end Video8 machines, there was no compelling reason to switch to Video8 for the home application.

Initially, many movies were prerecorded in 8mm format for home and rental use, but the rental market for Video8 never materialized. Sony maintained a line of Video8 home VCRs well into the 1990s, but unlike VHS, 8mm VCRs with timers were very expensive.

Sony also produced a line of Video8 Walkman-branded players and recorders, with and without a flip-up screen meant for video playback and limited recording. These have been adapted for Digital8 as well as MiniDV formats, even as portable DVD players have become popular in this application. Such players saw use in professional applications, particularly with airlines, which, during the 1980s, adopted 8mm as the format for in-flight movies. They remained in use among some airlines until at least 2015.

=== Videography ===
Among home and amateur videographers, Video8/Hi8 was popular enough for Sony to make equipment for video editing and production. The format also saw some use in professional electronic news gathering and electronic field production.

=== Professional 8-track audio ===

TASCAM used Hi8 tapes to develop an 8-track professional digital audio format called DTRS (Digital Tape Recording System). The format was first used in the DA-88 and similar models. While the cassettes are physically interchangeable, these recordings are not interchangeable with 8mm video formats.

<doc id="948381" wikidata="Q3101841" url="?curid=948381" title="George P. Bush">
<text>George Prescott Bush (born April 24, 1976) is an American politician and attorney who served as the commissioner of the Texas General Land Office from 2015 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, Bush unsuccessfully campaigned for the party&#x27;s nomination in the 2022 Texas Attorney General election.

A fourth-generation elected official of the Bush family, he is the eldest child of former governor of Florida Jeb Bush; nephew of the 43rd president, George W. Bush; grandson of the 41st president, George H. W. Bush; and great-grandson of former U.S. senator from Connecticut Prescott Bush.

== Early life and education ==
Bush was born in Houston, Texas, to Jeb and Columba Bush (née Garnica Gallo). Bush has two siblings: younger sister Noelle Lucila Bush and younger brother John Ellis Bush Jr. Bush attended Gulliver Preparatory School in the Miami area.

In December 1994, Bush was involved in an incident at his former girlfriend&#x27;s home after attempting to break in and later driving his car through the front yard. His girlfriend&#x27;s father declined to press charges. He graduated from Rice University with a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1998. He then attended the University of Texas School of Law from 2000 until 2003, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree.

== Career ==

=== Education ===

From August 1998 until June 1999, Bush taught social studies at a public high school in Homestead, Florida. Bush was the Tarrant County chairman for Uplift Education, a charter school district in Dallas.

=== Legal ===

Bush clerked for U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Texas, Sidney A. Fitzwater, from September 2003 until 2004. From 2004 to 2007 he practiced corporate and securities law with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld LLP in Dallas. In 2005, Bush was selected as one of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;″s &quot;Rising Stars&quot; for his work with Akin Gump. 

From 2007 to 2012, Bush was a partner at Pennybacker Capital, LLC, a real estate private equity firm in Austin, Texas. The firm was originally named N3 Capital and headquartered in Fort Worth. In 2012, he founded St. Augustine Partners, an energy and technology-focused investment firm in Fort Worth. After Bush&#x27;s defeat in the March 2022 attorney general primary to Ken Paxton, he went to work for a Wisconsin-based law firm called Michael Best &amp; Friedrich LLP, based out of Austin. In 2024 he was named the Managing Partner of the Austin office.

== Military service ==

Bush told &quot;Politico&quot; that attending the October 2006 launch of the inspired him to join the United States Navy. He also called the death of Pat Tillman, the National Football League player and Army Ranger who was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004, &quot;a wake-up call&quot;.

In March 2007, the United States Navy Reserve selected Bush for training as an intelligence officer through the direct commission officer program, a Navy initiative whereby applicants in specialized civilian fields forgo the typical prerequisites of a commission, such as the Naval Academy, NROTC or OCS, and—instead—attend the Direct Commissioned Officer Indoctrination Course (DCOIC), a three-week course on subjects such as naval history, customs and courtesies, followed by online classes. He was commissioned as a Navy Reserve Officer in May 2007. Bush served in Afghanistan for eight months from June 2010 to February 2011. During the deployment, he was given a different name for security purposes. Bush left the U.S. Navy Reserve in May 2017 as a lieutenant.

== Texas Land Commissioner ==

=== 2014 election ===
In September 2012, Bush announced his intention to run for office, saying that he was considering one of several state offices. Two months later he filed papers required to run for state office in Texas. The same month, his father, Jeb Bush, emailed donors requesting that they support him in his 2014 bid for Texas Land Commissioner.

In January 2013, Bush filed a campaign finance report stating he had received about $1.3 million in campaign contributions. In March 2013, Bush filed to run for Texas Land Commissioner. The main role of the Land Office is negotiating and enforcing leases for mineral rights on millions of acres of land owned by the State of Texas.

By June 2013, Bush had raised $3.3 million even though no Democratic candidate had emerged for land commissioner. On November 19, 2013, he officially filed the papers to run for Texas Land Commissioner.

In the 2014 Republican primary, outgoing Land Commissioner Jerry E. Patterson ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor while Bush defeated David Watts of Gilmer in Upshur County for the Republican nomination for land commissioner; Bush received 74 percent of the vote, totalling 937,987 votes to Watts&#x27; 27 percent with 346,949 votes.

In the November 4 general election, Bush faced Democrat John Cook, a former mayor of El Paso. Bush won 61 percent of the vote against token opposition, carrying &quot;virtually every demographic&quot; and riding a nationwide Republican wave in the midterms. He became the only Bush to win his first election.

=== 2018 election ===
, Bush had about $3.1 million in campaign cash for his re-election campaign. He won the March 6, 2018, Republican primary with nearly 58 percent of the vote, defeating three other candidates including Jerry E. Patterson, the previous land commissioner. In the general election, Bush received 53.68 percent of the vote to Democratic candidate Miguel Suazo&#x27;s 43.19 percent and Libertarian Matt Pina&#x27;s 3.1 percent.

=== Tenure ===

Bush assumed office on January 2, 2015.

As state land commissioner, Bush oversaw the Texas General Land Office (GLO), which manages about 13 million acres of state land and is in charge of auctions for leases to extract oil and natural gas on those lands.

In 2015, the GLO under Bush took control of the Alamo, a historic site in San Antonio, ending the state&#x27;s partnership with the Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT), which had managed the site for decades. In firing DRT as managers of the Alamo, Bush alleged that the group had violated its contract. Bush locked the DRT out of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas Library, and the GLO claimed ownership over the library&#x27;s collections and artifacts. DRT sued, and the suit was settled in 2016, with Bush and the GLO relinquishing their claims and agreeing to pay the DRT $200,000 in legal fees. Bush oversaw a $450-million remodel of the Alamo and the plaza around it. In 2015, Bush spoke at a fundraising event for the Alamo Endowment, which took over management of the site in conjunction with the GLO. English singer Phil Collins donated various Alamo-related artifacts to the State of Texas, with the stipulation that the State of Texas build a facility to hold the artifacts within a seven-year period. The Texas state legislature made a one-time infusion of $25 million to Bush&#x27;s GLO to redevelop the Alamo site, and the city of San Antonio agreed to provide $1 million for the redevelopment.

Bush dismissed some one hundred land commission employees hired under the preceding Commissioner Jerry E. Patterson. According to the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;, Bush paid almost $1 million in taxpayer funds to encourage the dismissed personnel not to file suit against either him or the agency. He kept at least forty persons on the payroll for up to five months after terminating their employment; they agreed in writing not to sue.

In 2016, the office began a multi-year study on the flood effects of the Houston area and Texas coast.

In June 2020, amid reports that George W. Bush and Jeb Bush would not support Trump&#x27;s re-election, George P. Bush announced his full support for Trump, saying &quot;Trump is the only thing standing between America and socialism.&quot;

In 2021, Bush supported the ouster of Liz Cheney from her position as chair of the House Republican Conference in Congress.

In 2020 and 2021, Bush said he was considering running for Texas attorney general in 2022 against incumbent Ken Paxton, a Republican accused of scandal. On June 2, 2021, Bush officially announced his candidacy.

== 2022 Texas Attorney General election ==

In June 2021, Bush entered the race for Texas Attorney General with a campaign video that praises Donald Trump and does not mention his father, grandfather, or great-grandfather. Trump then endorsed Bush&#x27;s opponent, Ken Paxton.

During the campaign, Bush criticized the ways in which Paxton sought to overturn the 2020 election results, but said that he did not disagree with Paxton&#x27;s &quot;intent.&quot; His campaign talking points were &quot;massive voter fraud&quot;, &quot;critical race theory&quot; in schools, finishing the &quot;Trump wall&quot;, and district attorneys in big cities &quot;who are not on the side of law enforcement.&quot; He also said he would &quot;go after human traffickers and drug cartels&quot;.

Bush was defeated by Ken Paxton who received 68% of the vote and Bush obtained 32% of the vote in the primary election runoff. &quot;The Texas Tribune&quot; wrote Bush&#x27;s &quot;defeat could mark the end of a four-generation political dynasty.&quot;

== Political activities ==
=== Campaign activities for his relatives and Donald Trump ===

At the age of 12, Bush spoke before the 1988 Republican National Convention, which nominated his grandfather. He also spoke at the 1992 convention on the occasion of his renomination. He campaigned for his uncle, George W. Bush, during his successful 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns, often performing outreach to Latino voters. He worked on the 2000 presidential campaign from 1999 to 2000. Bush has called himself a &quot;George W. Bush Republican&quot; on immigration reform, and has expressed support for portions of the DREAM Act in the past.

When asked in 2003 about whether he planned to run for office himself, Bush replied that his grandmother, Barbara Bush, had advised that anyone thinking about entering politics should distinguish himself in some other field first: &quot;Make a name for yourself, have a family, marry someone great, have some kids, buy a house, pay taxes, and do the things everyone also does instead of just running out and saying, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;m the nephew of or the son of or the grandson of...&#x27;&quot;

His father campaigned in the 2016 Republican presidential race, but later dropped out. After his father&#x27;s exit, Bush campaigned for Donald Trump while most of the remainder of the Bush family did not support him. By 2021, ABC News described Bush as an &quot;avowed Trump backer&quot; and Trump, who had shown animosity toward the Bush family in the past, favorably coined Bush as &quot;My Bush.&quot;

=== Republican Party positions ===

As of 2012, he was the deputy finance chairman of the Republican Party of Texas.

=== Work on political action committees ===

Bush was the national co-chair of Maverick PAC, a national political action committee dedicated to engaging the next generation of Republican voters. Bush served as a member of several diplomacy missions, including one to Nicaragua for the second peaceful transfer of power in that country, and one to Brazil for the Pan American Games in 2007. He also joined two US Congressional delegations, one to Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring of 2011 and one to Turkey in 2012 at the time of the civil war in neighboring Syria.

Bush is a co-founder and serves on the board of directors of Hispanic Republicans of Texas, a political action committee whose goal is to elect Republican political candidates to office in the state.

== Political positions ==
In August 2004, during a trip to Mexico sponsored by the group Republicans Abroad, he called Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez a dictator and criticized the U.S. Border Patrol&#x27;s use of guns which fire plastic pellets packed with chili powder. Bush was quoted as telling Mexican media, &quot;If there has been American approval for this policy, that is reprehensible. It&#x27;s kind of barbarous.&quot; He attributed the gun usage to &quot;some local INS guy who&#x27;s trying to be tough, act macho&quot;, although it is an agency policy.

In 2009, Bush criticized Florida Governor Charlie Crist for accepting money from the 2009 stimulus package, calling for a return to fiscal conservatism. In January 2010, he endorsed Marco Rubio, Crist&#x27;s opponent for the United States Senate.

Bush said that climate change is a serious threat to Texas but he does not accept the scientific consensus which attributes climate change to human activity.

In February 2021, Texas experienced a humanitarian crisis after widespread power outages were caused by the infrastructure not being weatherized. Although 90 percent of the power plants that failed were fueled by fossil and nuclear fuels, Bush attacked wind and solar energy: &quot;If the last few days have proven anything, it’s that we need oil &amp; gas. Relying solely on renewable energy would be catastrophic.&quot;

== Personal life ==

He was featured in &quot;People&quot;″s 100 most eligible bachelors in 2000.

Bush married law school classmate, Amanda L. Williams, on August 7, 2004, in Kennebunkport, Maine, at St. Ann&#x27;s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church Williams is a media law attorney at the firm Jackson Walker LLP in Fort Worth, Texas. The couple has two sons.

== Awards and honors ==

In 2016, the League of United Latin American Citizens Council No. 12 in Laredo gave Bush and Mexican official José Antonio Meade Kuribreña the titles of &quot;Señor Internacional&quot;, an honor given to distinguished figures in the border region.

<doc id="948383" wikidata="Q7655609" url="?curid=948383" title="Sweet and Sour (1984 TV series)">
<text>Sweet and Sour was an Australian television series that screened on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1984. It was created by Tim Gooding and Johanna Pigott and was produced internally for the ABC by Jan Chapman.

==Synopsis==
The main storyline of the series followed the efforts of a fictional band, The Takeaways, to break into the Sydney music scene. &quot;The Takeaways have so far eluded commercial success. However, negotiations are presently underway for the band to sell their story to a prominent TV station, and really clean up.&quot;

In mid-1983 Sydney a band called The Takeaways is formed. Initially it consists of Carol Howard, Martin Kabel and George Poulopoulos.
Carol Howard (Tracy Mann) is an attractive vocalist and novice guitarist from Melbourne; she had pursued an acting career with little success but is now focussed on her music. Carol wrote her first song on the train to Sydney.

Martin Kabel (David Reyne) is an established, albeit unsuccessful, guitarist who wants to branch out from his current band: he would like to sing his own songs. Martin gets his chance with The Takeaways.

George Poulopoulos (Arky Michael) is more interested in playing soccer for the Combined Hellenic Travel Agents but reluctantly joins to play bass. He learns how to play at the band&#x27;s first practice session; slowly he overcomes his shyness to become a confident performer.

Darrell Winters (Ric Herbert) sees a quick dollar to be made as their manager; Darrell talks the talk and tries to walk the walk. He sets out to organise their first gig: a backyard barbecue! Fortunately better gigs followed in various Sydney pubs. Their first jam sessions are in an old boot factory.

Meanwhile, Christine Yates (Sandra Lillingston) breaks into their house and rather than turn her in to the police they offer her a spot in their band. Christine&#x27;s father, legendary 1960s saxophonist Shrug Yates (Martin Vaughan), taught her to &#x27;feel&#x27; music while playing sax. Christine sings lead vocal on some songs.

Initially they play their gigs using a drum machine until Johnny Black (Robin Copp), an established drummer, joins.

Some six months later, The Takeaways release an independent single, &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot;, and await the pressing of their first album. They meet recording executives and media personalities including Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum and artist Jon English. They undertake a tour of Melbourne to promote the first single.

There is some romantic tension between Carol and Martin, and between George and Christine. Martin is brash and confident but his Lothario image is belied by his naivety when he deals with a female music executive (Megan Williams). Darrell starts to believe his own PR and eventually becomes more interested in his music video career than the band. Manipulation by music industry insiders sees both Martin and Carol tempted by solo deals; eventually the group splits.

The outer cover of their first Soundtrack album shows The Takeaways in a similar pose to the inner cover photo but has them as neon outlines whereas the second Soundtrack has the same neon outlines but with a reversed design. The neon outlines were also animated and used on their first promo video.

Other actors in the show included Megan Williams, Martin Vaughan as Christine&#x27;s father Shrug, Jane Clifton, Rocky Horror star Daniel Abineri, George Spartels as Nick, George&#x27;s older brother, Carmen Tanti and Michelle Stayner.

==Musicians and songwriters==
Numerous Australian and New Zealand musicians and songwriters were involved in this TV series.

The title song of the series,&quot;Sweet and Sour&quot;, was written by Sharon O&#x27;Neill, who also recorded the song in 1987 as &quot;In Control&quot; on her album &quot;Danced in the Fire&quot;. Deborah Conway (Do-Ré-Mi) was actor Tracy Mann&#x27;s &#x27;singing voice&#x27; and sang the hit &quot;Sweet &amp; Sour&quot; (#13 Australian national singles chart). The song&#x27;s lyrics relate to self-empowerment in the face of life&#x27;s vagaries: &quot;Life can be sweet and sour, But I am in control. It can chill me to the bone, Give me wings to fly on my own.&quot;

Music was directed by Martin Armiger (The Sports, Stephen Cummings Band) who also provided backing vocals, lead guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, drums and lyrics. Associate Music Director Graham Bidstrup (The Angels, GANGgajang) also provided backing vocals, keyboards, percussion and lyrics. In 1980, Bidstrup had produced a single, &quot;Russia Rocks&quot;, for an Australian group The Takeaways. Assistant to Music Director Stephen O&#x27;Rourke also provided backing vocals.

The list of recording musicians/songwriters includes Tommy Emmanuel, Chris Bailey (The Angels, GANGgajang), Eric McCusker (Mondo Rock), Red Symons (Skyhooks), &quot;Freddie&quot; Strauks (Skyhooks), Todd Hunter (Dragon, XL Capris), Rick Grossman (Divinyls, Hoodoo Gurus), Mark Edwards (The Runners), Tony Buchanan (Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs mk2) and Reg Mombassa (Mental As Anything).

Cathy McQuade (Deckchairs Overboard) was Sandra Lillingston&#x27;s &#x27;singing voice&#x27; and John Clifforth (Deckchairs Overboard) was David Reyne&#x27;s &#x27;singing voice&#x27; (both Reyne and Herbert sang backing vocals on some tracks).

The soundtrack album went platinum, selling over 70,000 copies.

Australian band GANGgajang were formed as a direct result of four of their members involvement as musicians/songwriters for this show: Chris Bailey, Graham Bidstrup, Mark Callaghan and Kay Bee.

Cameo appearances from other Australian musicians include, The Johnnys playing Slip Slap Fishin&#x27; and Rebel Yell live in Episode 3 and Richard Clapton playing acoustic in the street in Episode 6. Kirk Pengilly from INXS appeared in Episode 7 and Chrissie Amphlett from the Divinyls popped up in Episode 8.

==&quot;Countdown&quot; links==
As an ABC TV show, there was a natural tie-in to &quot;Countdown&quot;, with guest appearance by Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum. &quot;Sweet &amp; Sour&quot; (lead vocal Conway) was shown on the 12 August 1984 episode of &quot;Countdown&quot;. The promo clip does not show The Takeaways&#x27; &#x27;bass player&#x27; George (Arky Michael), but does include a juggler, acrobat and stage magician. On the same &quot;Countdown&quot; episode were O&#x27;Neill performing &quot;Power&quot; and Stephen Cummings performing &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (Armiger as producer/musician/songwriter). &quot;Glam To Wham&quot; (lead vocal Conway, backing vocal McQuade) was broadcast &quot;Countdown&quot; on 7 October 1984, with guest hosts Michael, Lillingston and Herbert of The Takeaways (during which Herbert refers to Arky Michael as &quot;Spartels&quot;). It shows Lillingston miming to Conway&#x27;s vocals; however, in the &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot; TV series Lillingston&#x27;s vocals were supplied by McQuade and she only sang lead on &quot;Digging A Hole&quot; and &quot;On The Street Where You Live&quot;. Also on the 7 October episode was Cummings performing &quot;Another Kick to the Head&quot; (Armiger as producer/musician/songwriter).

The pilot episode was directed by Grant Rule, an Executive Producer of &quot;Countdown&quot;, it was shot in an old warehouse in Pyrmont and starred Terry Serrio from the Elks and Joy Smithers, who would later star in &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot; mini series with Nicole Kidman. The guitar player was Marty Shiel (Juggernaut). Another link to &quot;Countdown&quot; is the selection and briefing of songwriters by &quot;Countdown&quot; Awards co-producer Carolyn James, credited as researcher on the LP sleeve. On advice from Peter Hall at Rondor Publishing, Carolyn also negotiated with Jan Chapman a first for ABC drama. Instead of a one-off single payment for a song, a &quot;No Favoured Nations&quot; contract was offered to all songwriters. This meant the music budget stretched much further, and that signed and unsigned writers received ongoing royalty payments for each unit sold and so provided significant income to lesser-known songwriters such as David McComb of The Triffids. Graham Thorburn came up from producing and directing &quot;Countdown&quot; to direct four episodes.

New Zealand&#x27;s TVNZ series &quot;Heroes&quot;, released 21 October 1984, &quot;is about a group of musicians just getting started as a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band&quot;. It ran for 8 episodes in 1984 and 6 in 1986. Actors included Michael Hurst, Jay Laga&#x27;aia, Margaret Umbers and John Gibson.

==Creators, Writers, and Directors==
Tim Gooding and Johanna Pigott were members of Sydney post-punk band, XL Capris (1978–1982). Dragon bassist Todd Hunter later produced the band before joining the line-up. Pigott and Hunter wrote &quot;Rain&quot; for the reformed Dragon, and &quot;Age of Reason&quot; for John Farnham. Gooding and Pigott both wrote for the TV Series &quot;Heartbreak High&quot;(Hunter composed its music) and for &quot;Mortified&quot;.

Writers for &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot; were Gooding, Pigott, Michael Cove, Paul Leadon, David Poltorak, Bert Deling, Forrest Redlich and Debra Oswald. Directors were Geoffrey Nottage, Riccardo Pellizzeri, Graham Thorburn, Posie Graeme-Evans (aka Posie Jacobs) and Helena Harris.

<doc id="948390" wikidata="Q707140" url="?curid=948390" title="Chinese Culture University">
<text>The Chinese Culture University (CCU; ) is a private Taiwanese university located in Yangmingshan in Shilin District, Taipei, Taiwan. Established in 1962, CCU is one of the largest universities in Taiwan with an enrollment of about 32,000 students. Satellite campuses are located in the Jianguo, Ximending, and Zhongxiao East Road areas of Taipei City. 

==History==
The school was founded as Far East University in 1962 by Chang Ch&#x27;i-yun, and it was renamed College of Chinese Culture by President Chiang Kai-shek in 1963. It became Chinese Culture University in 1980.

The main campus is located on Yang Ming Mountain, overlooks the Tienmu District, and is about a 45-minute drive from Taipei Main Station. The area is known for its extensive hiking trails and hot springs. The university is located just off of the main road that winds up the mountain where amenities can be found. Many of the students rent apartments in this small village area and the city buses have stops along the main road.

Chinese Culture University has been reorganized many times. The Ministry of Education granted the University permission to establish studies in philosophy, Chinese, Eastern languages, English, French, German, history, geography, news, art, music, drama, physical education, domestic science, and architecture.

==Academics==
CCU has 12 colleges: Agriculture, Arts, Business Administration, Education, Engineering, Environmental Design, Foreign Languages, Journalism and Mass Communications, Law, Liberal Arts, Science, and Social Sciences. CCU first appeared and ranked 401-450 in the QS 2022 Asian Universities Ranking.

In 2023, CCU was ranked 16th best Taiwanese university focusing on humanities and social sciences by &quot;Global Views Monthly&quot;.

==Transportation==

The relatively inconvenient and isolated location of CCU&#x27;s main campus has presented students and staff with transportation problems. While the university operates a number of school buses to transport faculty, staff and students up and down the mountain every day, many students chose to ride scooters up to the main campus. This has resulted in a high number of student injuries and fatalities each semester. Public buses, the R5 and 260, also operate between the main campus and downtown Taipei. These buses also make stops at Jiantan and Shilin MRT train stations. Taxi service can be found on the main campus with taxis waiting for students and teachers in front of the university sports centre during the daytime hours.

==Facilities==
CCU has four campuses in Taipei City. The main campus is located on Yang Ming Mountain and three other smaller campuses are located in Jianguo, Ximending, and Zhongxiao East Road in downtown Taipei. The Jianguo campus is the location of the Mandarin Training Centre, while the Zhongxiao East Road campus is the location of the International Language Institute. The Ximending campus offers a variety of both credit and non-credit courses in addition to being an extension campus for the College of Law.

===The Hwa Kang Museum===

Established in 1971, the university museum, also called the Hwa Kang Museum, is the first comprehensive museum of its kind in Taiwan. Its permanent collection consists of Chinese ceramics from the many centuries, modern Chinese paintings and calligraphic works, Chinese folk arts and woodblock prints. Some highlights of the collection include pieces by Wang Yangming, Wu Changshuo, Woo Tsin-hang, Yu Youren, Puru, Chang Dai-chien, and Li Meishu.

==Athletics==
CCU offers martial arts programs on the Yang Ming Shan campus. The CCU Judo team is internationally competitive and a number of members have won their division in both national and international tournaments. The CCU Martial Arts Department also offers courses in Japanese ju jitsu, aikido and kung fu.

The CCU baseball program was established in 1964, in the second year of the school&#x27;s history.

<doc id="948391" wikidata="Q461943" url="?curid=948391" title="Ducking stool">
<text>Ducking stools or cucking stools were chairs formerly used for punishment of disorderly women, scolds, and dishonest tradesmen in medieval Europe and elsewhere at later times. The ducking-stool was a form of , or &quot;women&#x27;s punishment&quot;, as referred to in Langland&#x27;s &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; (1378). They were instruments of public humiliation and censure both primarily for the offense of scolding or and less often for sexual offences like bearing an illegitimate child or prostitution.

The stools were technical devices which formed part of the wider method of law enforcement through social humiliation. A common alternative was a court order to recite one&#x27;s crimes or sins after Mass or in the market place on market day or informal action such as a Skimmington ride. They were usually of local manufacture with no standard design. Most were simply chairs into which the offender could be tied and exposed at her door or the site of her offence. Some were on wheels like a tumbrel that could be dragged around the parish. Some were put on poles so that they could be plunged into water, hence &quot;ducking&quot; stool. Stocks or pillories were similarly used for the punishment of men or women by humiliation.

The term &quot;cucking-stool&quot; is older, with written records dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. Written records for the name &quot;ducking stool&quot; appear from 1597, and a statement in 1769 relates that &quot;ducking-stool&quot; is a corruption of the term &quot;cucking-stool&quot;. Whereas a cucking-stool could be and was used for humiliation with or without dunking the person in water, the name &quot;ducking-stool&quot; came to be used more specifically for those cucking-stools on an oscillating plank which were used to duck the person into water.

==Cucking-stools==
A ballad, dating from about 1615, called &quot;The Cucking of a Scold&quot;, illustrates the punishment inflicted to women whose behaviour made them be identified as &quot;a Scold&quot;:

The cucking-stool, or &quot;Stool of Repentance&quot;, has a long history, and was used by the Saxons, who called it the &#x27; or &quot;scolding stool&quot;. It is mentioned in &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as being in use at Chester, being called &#x27;, a name which seems to confirm the first of the derivations suggested in the footnote below. Tied to this stool the woman—her head and feet bare—was publicly exposed at her door or paraded through the streets amidst the jeers of the crowd.

The term &quot;cucking-stool&quot; is known to have been in use from about 1215. It means literally &quot;defecation chair&quot;, as its name is derived from the old verb &quot;&quot; and has not quite been rid of in many parts of the English speaking world as &quot;to cack&quot; (defecate) (akin to Dutch &quot;&quot; and Latin &quot;&quot; [same meaning]; &quot;cf.&quot; Greek &quot;&quot; [&quot;bad/evil, vile, ugly, worthless&quot;]), rather than, as popularly believed, from the word &quot;cuckold&quot;.

Both seem to have become more common in the second half of the sixteenth century. It has been suggested this reflected developing strains in gender relations, but it may simply be a result of the differential survival of records. The cucking-stool appears to have still been in use as late as the mid-18th century, with &quot;Poor Robin&#x27;s Almanack&quot; of 1746 observing:

==Ducking-stools==
The ducking-stool was a strongly-made wooden armchair (the surviving specimens are of oak) in which the offender was seated, an iron band being placed around them so that they should not fall out during their immersion. The earliest record of the use of such is towards the beginning of the 17th century, with the term being first attested in English in 1597. It was used both in Europe and in the English colonies of North America.

Usually, the chair was fastened to a long wooden beam fixed as a seesaw on the edge of a pond or river. Sometimes, however, the ducking-stool was not a fixture but was mounted on a pair of wooden wheels so that it could be wheeled through the streets, and at the river-edge was hung by a chain from the end of a beam. In sentencing a woman the magistrates ordered the number of duckings she should have. Yet another type of ducking-stool was called a tumbrel. It was a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This was pushed into the pond and then the shafts released, thus tipping the chair up backwards. Sometimes the punishment proved fatal and the subject died.

==Use in identifying witches==
In medieval times until the early 18th century, ducking was a way used to establish whether a suspect was a witch. The ducking stools were first used for this purpose but ducking was later inflicted without the chair. In this instance the subject&#x27;s right thumb was bound to her left big toe. A rope was tied around the waist of the accused and she was thrown into a river or deep pond. If she floated, it was deemed that she was in league with the devil, rejecting the baptismal water. If she sank, she was &quot;cleared. And dead&quot;.

==Notable examples==
=== Surviving examples ===
The tumbrel of a ducking stool is in the crypt of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick. There is also a ducking chair in Canterbury, where the High Street meets the River Stour.

A surviving ducking stool is on public display outside the Criminal Museum (&quot;Kriminalmuseum&quot;) in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, a well-preserved medieval town in Bavaria, Germany.

=== Replicas ===
A complete ducking stool is on public display in Leominster Priory, Herefordshire. The town clock, commissioned for the Millennium, features a moving ducking stool depiction.

Christchurch, Dorset, continues to house a replica ducking stool, at the site where punishments were once carried out.

=== Early mentions ===
There is a reference from about 1378 to a ducking stool as (&quot;women&#x27;s punishment&quot;),

=== In film ===
A type of ducking stool can be seen briefly in the film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975).

In the 1944 Powell and Pressburger film &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot;, an American soldier stopping over at the town hall in fictional Chillingbourne (a village near Canterbury), is puzzled by an antique piece of furniture that he spots; the local magistrate informs him that it is a ducking stool. 

In the Laurel and Hardy feature film &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, Laurel and Hardy are sentenced to the ducking stool, followed by banishment to Boogeyland, for burgling Barnaby&#x27;s house.

==Demise==
The last recorded cases are those of a Mrs Ganble at Plymouth (1808); Jenny Pipes, a &quot;notorious scold&quot; (1809), and Sarah Leeke (1817), both of Leominster. In the last case, the water in the pond was so low that the offender was merely wheeled around the town in the chair. The common law offence of common scold was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution for sex discrimination. Long before this decision, the punishment of ducking, together with all other forms of corporal punishment, had become unlawful under the provisions of the New Jersey Constitution of 1844 or even as early as 1776.

<doc id="948396" wikidata="Q1142226" url="?curid=948396" title="Nihon Falcom">
<text>is a Japanese video game developer, best known for their &quot;Ys&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Trails&quot; series. They are credited with pioneering the action role-playing and Japanese role-playing game genres, as well as popularizing the use of personal computers in Japan.

==History==
Nihon Falcom was founded by Masayuki Kato in 1981. They are credited with laying the foundations for the action role-playing and Japanese role-playing game genres. The name Falcom came from the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; and the final &quot;n&quot; was changed to an &quot;m&quot; to fit naming trends of that time. The word Nihon, taken after one of the native names of Japan, was added to make it sound more complete.

Falcom&#x27;s first role-playing game (RPG) was &quot;Panorama Toh&quot;, released for the PC-8801 in 1983 and created by Yoshio Kiya, who would go on to create the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; and &quot;Brandish&quot; franchises. While its RPG elements were limited, lacking traditional statistical or leveling systems, the game featured real-time combat with a gun, bringing it close to the action RPG formula that Falcom would later be known for. Set on a desert island, the game&#x27;s overworld is presented as a hex grid and featured a day-night cycle. There were also indigenous non-player characters (NPCs) who the player could choose to attack, have a conversation with, or give money for items, though NPCs could choose to run away with the money. In order to survive on the island, the player needs to find and consume rations, as every normal action consumes hit points. The island also has traps, which require calling for help and waiting for NPCs to help. The player could also be bit by snakes that poison and paralyze the player, requiring medicine to heal or calling for help from NPCs.

Falcom eventually went on to create their flagship franchises, including the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Heroes&quot; and &quot;Ys&quot; series. The original &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; was responsible for setting the template for the action role-playing genre. &quot;Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu&quot; (1985) had more than 400,000 copies sold, making it the best-selling PC game up until that time.

While most of Falcom&#x27;s games have been ported to various video game consoles of all generations, they have only developed a few non-PC video games themselves. The company&#x27;s decision to develop mainly for PCs rather than consoles set them apart from their main rivals, Enix and Square, but limited the company&#x27;s popularity in the Western world, thus limiting their growth potential in the 1990s. By the early 2010s, the &quot;Ys&quot; series was second only to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series as the largest Japanese role-playing game franchise in terms of the overall number of game releases.

Falcom was also a pioneer in video game music, with their early soundtracks mostly composed by chiptune musicians Yuzo Koshiro and Mieko Ishikawa.

<text>Salekhard ( ; Khanty: , &quot;Pułñawat&quot;; , , formerly Obdorsk) is a town and the administrative centre of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia. The town lies on the Arctic Circle, with the town centre being about south and suburbs stretching to the north of the circle. The population is .

==History==
The settlement of Obdorsk () was founded in 1595, in the place of a Khanty settlement called Polnovat-Vozh (), by Russian settlers after the conquest of Siberia. It was situated on the Ob River, and its name supposedly derives from that. The land around Obdorsk was referred to as Obdorsky krai, or Obdoriya.

The town was often used as a place of exile during the Tsarist and Soviet periods. Among notable people who spent time here were the Doukhobor spiritual leader Pyotr Verigin and Leon Trotsky. The town and nearby area contained three Soviet camps where approximately 6,500 prisoners were held, arrested for their belief in God. At the port of Salekhard, approximately 1,500 prisoners were used as slave labor, loading and unloading goods at the dock, or mining metal ore. About 5,000 prisoners in two camps near Salekhard were forced to polish diamonds mined from Mir mine.

The nearest railway station is at Labytnangi on the opposite side of the river Ob. From 1949 to 1953, the Salekhard-Igarka Railway project made an unsuccessful attempt to extend the line to Igarka, claiming the lives of thousands of Gulag prisoners. The section of railway from Salekhard to Nadym was completed and remained in use for some time in the Soviet era, although it was later abandoned. It is currently being rebuilt, along with a long-awaited bridge across the Ob between Labytnangi and Salekhard.

Salekhard was the host city for the 2006 Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in October 2006.

In April 2014, Rostelecom, a Russian Internet service provider, completed the final stretch of the Nadym-Salekhard optical Internet line, which stretches for almost .

In the Summer of 2016, temperatures as high as thawed anthrax-infected corpses that had been frozen since the soviet era near Salekhard, causing anthrax spores to infect reindeer herds and herders.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one rural locality, incorporated as the town of okrug significance of Salekhard—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of okrug significance of Salekhard is incorporated as Salekhard Urban Okrug.

==Demographics==
As of 2021, the ethnic composition of Salekhard was:
* Russians – 66.3%
* Tatars – 7.1%
* Khanty – 3.8%
* Ukrainians – 3.7%
* Nenets – 3.7%
* Komi – 2.0%
* Kyrgyz – 1.4%
* Others – 12%

==Economy==

Yamal Airlines has its head office in Salekhard. Most of residents are employed in reindeer herding, fishing and the services sector.

By 2015, about from the airport, near the Arctic Circle, authorities plan to build a large polar resort &quot;Center of the Arctic tourism&quot;.

===Transportation===

Salekhard is located in the Ob river valley and is an important river port of the Russian Far North. The unfinished Salekhard–Igarka Railway was set to provide a rail connection between the Ob river port of Salekhard and the Yenisei river port of Igarka. Currently, the nearest railway is at Labytnangi, northwest on the opposite side of the river Ob. The project Northern Latitudinal Railway will provide Salekhard access to Russian railway and will further connect Salekhard to the Konosha–Vorkuta railway and other parts of European Russia. The Salekhard Bridge project, a combined railway-road bridge over Ob river, is the main component of Northern Latitudinal Railway that will connect Labytnangi and Salekhard is to be constructed with the cost of 60 billion rubles. Nadym–Salekhard road, a 344 km long road, was inaugurated in December 2020 to the 90th anniversary of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, it will facilate the construction of a railway between the two cities and connects the eastern and western parts of Yamal Okrug. For 9–10 months each year, the Ob river is frozen and cars and trucks can drive across the river ice. In the summer a ferry operates, however during the floating of ice, generally shortly before the start and shortly after the end of summer, Salekhard is effectively isolated from the outside world, regarding freight. During these periods, only helicopters are able to reach Salekhard in case of emergency. Native people, mainly the Nenets and Khanty people, always build up stocks of food at home, in the shops, and in the markets during this period, but they still suffer from seasonal inflation. The city is also served by the Salekhard Airport, which is north of the main city.

<text>Clube da Esquina (, in English &quot;Corner Club&quot;) was a Brazilian music artists collective, originating in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. It is also the name of a double album from 1972. Clube da Esquina mixes rock and roll, progressive rock, bossa nova and jazz styles, with Brazilian folk music and classical music influences. The Beatles and the Platters were also an important influence on Clube da Esquina.

Together with Tropicália, Clube da Esquina is usually regarded as the Brazilian musical movement that achieved the greatest international resonance in the post-bossa nova period (beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s).

== History of Clube da Esquina ==

In 1963 Milton Nascimento moved from Três Pontas, in the midlands of the state of Minas Gerais, to the capital Belo Horizonte, looking for work. He settled at the Levy Building, where he found his future collaborators, the Borges family, including Márcio Borges and Lô Borges. Milton and Márcio started composing (Milton had already played in some bars of Belo Horizonte): Márcio wrote the lyrics, and Milton wrote the music. Ever since, Márcio has played an important role in the history of Clube de Esquina as a lyricist, mainly together with, at a later stage, Fernando Brant.

In 1972, the first LP was recorded for EMI, &quot;Clube da Esquina&quot;. While it was released under Milton&#x27;s and Lô&#x27;s names and featured many compositions and contributions from them, it was a collaborative effort of many members of the collective. It was a double LP and had a youth group, and it attracted attention because of its engaging compositions, its patchwork of sounds, and its poetic richness. The group wrote a part of one of the most important chapters in the history of Brazilian popular music. It drew the attention of musicians from Brazil and abroad with its artistic daring and innovative creativity.

At the time, critics lacked the ability to understand what was happening and made harsh comments about the work. But the album had soon won international recognition and prestige in Brazil. The album and its creators became the head of a network musicians around the world, making it a benchmark of style and aesthetics in contemporary music.

It was followed by another album in 1978 (&quot;Clube da Esquina 2&quot;), which contained tracks written by artists who were not part of the original group (such as Chico Buarque).

<text>Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEF, less commonly, Surrendered Enemy Forces) is a US designation for soldiers who surrender to an adversary after hostilities end, and for those POWs who had already surrendered and were held in camps in occupied German territory at the time. It was General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s designation of German prisoners in post–World War II occupied Germany.

Because of the logistical difficulties of feeding all of the nearly two million of surrendered German soldiers at the levels required by the Geneva Convention during the food crisis of 1945, the purpose of the designation, along with the British designation of Surrendered Enemy Personnel (SEP), was to prevent categorization of the prisoners as prisoners of war (POW) under the 1929 Geneva Convention.

==Germany at the end of the war==
Food and agriculture in Nazi Germany had declined greatly in 1944 and 1945. Germany had mobilized for total war, and food for the troops and war workers was vital to the war. A shortage of synthetic fertilizers had developed after nitrogen and phosphate stocks were channeled into ammunition (explosives) production, and much of the potato crop was requisitioned to produce ethanol fuel for the military&#x27;s V-2 arsenal. Consequently, crop levels had fallen by 20% to 30% at the end of the war. Allied bombing raids had destroyed thousands of farm buildings, and rendered food processing facilities inoperable. Lack of farm machinery, spare parts, and fertilizer caused an almost total disruption of agriculture when the war was over. After the release of Ostarbeiters, slave laborers that were Soviet POWs and Eastern Europeans, extreme agriculture labor shortages existed that could be relieved only by German DEFs and SEPs. Roving bands of displaced persons and returning soldiers and civilians decimated the hog herds and chicken flocks of German farmers.

The destroyed German transportation infrastructure created additional logistical difficulties, with railroad lines, bridges, canals and terminals left in ruins. The turnaround time for railroad wagons was five times higher than the prewar average. Of the 15,600 German locomotives, 38.6% were no longer operating and 31% were damaged. Only 1,000 of the 13,000 kilometers of track in the British zone were operable. Urban centers often had to be supplied with horse-drawn carriages and wheeled carts.

By May 8, 1945, the Allies had become responsible for the health and wellbeing of 7 million displaced persons in Germany and 1.6 million in Austria, including slave laborers from all over Europe. Soon thereafter, German populations had swollen by 12 to 14.5 million ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union. Bavarian villages in the American zone faced 15% to 25% population increases from displaced persons, with Munich alone having to deal with 75,000 displaced persons.

The worst dislocation of agriculture was caused by the German zonal partitions, which cut off Western Germany from its &quot;breadbasket&quot; of farm lands east of the Oder-Neisse line that had accounted for 35% of Germany&#x27;s prewar food production, and which the Yalta Conference had given to Poland to compensate for lands of Eastern Poland. The Soviet Union, with millions of its own starving citizens at home, was not willing to distribute this production to the population in western Germany. In January 1945, the basic German ration was 1,625 calories/day, and that was further reduced to 1,100 calories by the end of the war in the British zone, and remained at that level into the summer, with levels varying from 840 calories/day in the Ruhr to 1,340 calories/day in Hamburg. The situation was no better in the American zones of Germany and Austria.

These problems combined to create severe shortages across Germany. One summary report estimated that just prior to Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, German consumer daily caloric intake was only 1,050, and that after V-E Day it dropped to 860 calories per day, though actual estimates are confusing because of the wide variation by location and because unofficial estimates were usually higher. It was clear by any measure that, by the spring of 1945, the German population was existing on rations that would not sustain life in the long term. A July 1945 CCAC report stated that &quot;the food situation in western Germany is perhaps the most serious problem of the occupation. Average consumption is now about one third below the general accepted subsistence level of 2000 calories per day.&quot;

In the spring of 1946 the International Red Cross was finally allowed to provide limited amounts of food aid to prisoners of war in the U.S. occupation zone. By June 1948, DEF rations had been increased to 1990 calories and in December 1949 rationing was effectively discontinued and the food crisis was over.

== Number of surrenders in World War II ==

Approximately 35 million POWs were taken in World War II, 11 million of them Germans. In addition to 20 million dislocated citizens, the U.S. Army had to cope with most of the surrendered German military forces. While the Allies had anticipated 3 million surrendering Germans, the actual total was as many as 5 million in American hands by June 1945 out of 7.6 million in northwestern Europe alone, not counting the 1.4 million in Allied hands in Italy. Approximately 1 million were Wehrmacht soldiers fleeing west to avoid capture by the Red Army.

The number of Germans surrendering to U.S. forces shot up from 313,000 by the end of the first quarter of 1945, to 2.6 million by April 1945, and more than 5 million in May. By April 1945, entire German Army groups were surrendering, which overwhelmed Allied shipping such that German prisoners could no longer be sent to POW camps in America after March 1945. According to a June 22, 1945, announcement by the Allies, a total of 7,614,914 prisoners (of all designations) were held in British and American camps.

Although the British and Americans agreed to split the western Germans who surrendered, the British recanted arguing that they &quot;did not have places to keep them or men to guard them on the continent, and that moving them to England would arouse public resentment and adversely affect British morale.&quot; By June 1, 1945, Eisenhower reported to the War Office that this refusal produced shortages in the 25 million prisoner-day rations which were growing at the rate of 900,000 prisoner-day rations. Feeding this number of people became a logistical nightmare for SHAEF, which frequently had to resort to improvisation.

==Early considerations of DEF designations==
Regarding the adherence to the Geneva Convention for vanquished Germans, Churchill at the Casablanca Conference in 1943 summed up the Allies’ &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; policy with &quot;If we are bound, we are bound by our consciences to civilization.&quot; In prosecuting the war, SHAEF carried out the decisions of the Combined (Anglo-American) Chiefs of Staff (CCS). They had to execute the directives of the European Advisory Commission (EAC), which included the Soviet Union. The CCS and EAC directives implemented policies of the heads of government who decided the most important questions of Allied occupation policy. After the EAC was set up by the 1943 Moscow Conference, it drafted the instruments of unconditional surrender. During the EAC debates the Allies determined that they could strip the Germans of all government, including their protection by international law, and be free to punish them without restriction. The Geneva Convention (GC) required SHAEF to feed German POWs a ration equal to its own base soldiers.

The original discussion of the Allies treating post-Victory in Europe (V-E) Day prisoners of war as something other than those protected by the Geneva Convention had its vague origins in the Casablanca Conference, but it was given specific form by the EAC in the summer of 1944 in a &quot;draft instrument of surrender&quot; given to the American government. The instrument required the surrendering German commander to accept that his men &quot;shall at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Allied State concerned be declared to be Prisoners of War.&quot; Several factors went into this consideration, including that the EAC member the Soviet Union refused to sign the Geneva Conventions, despite intense pressure from 1942 onward to sign the document. Behind the Soviets&#x27; refusal were a number of considerations closely linked with the regime, but a major consideration that emerged at the Tehran Conference was that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin desired four million German laborers for an &quot;indefinite period&quot;, perhaps for life. The Soviets&#x27; refusal to even consider signing the GC created great problems for the EAC, including the fact that a single surrender instrument could not be drafted if a Soviet commander taking the surrender could not possibly commit his government to accord GC rights to prisoners. As a result, the EAC instruments promised nothing in that regard, employed awkward and tortured language and made plain the premeditated Allied evasion of the Geneva Convention. In addition, other Allies also considered using Germans for prison labor, which the Germans themselves had already required of prisoners they had held during the war. Later EAC documents described the &quot;Disabled Enemy Forces&quot;.

==DEF and SEP designations==
With regard to food requirements, regardless of the reasoning or GC legal requirements, SHAEF was simply not capable of feeding all of the millions of German prisoners at the level of Allied base soldiers because of the high numbers and lack of resources. This was not deliberate policy, but the result of wartime damage to the infrastructure, which created the difficult problem of feeding the defeated peoples without it. In a March 10, 1945, cable to the CCS, Eisenhower requested permission for this designation per the earlier EAC documents, and was granted such permission. When the CCS approved Eisenhower&#x27;s March 1945 request, it added that prisoners after Victory in Europe (V-E Day) should not be declared &quot;Prisoners of War&quot; under the Geneva Convention because of the lack of food.

The CCS then cabled British Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander, supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, suggesting that the same steps be taken regarding the German surrenders in Austria, and then approved Alexander&#x27;s similar request for a DEF designation, stating &quot;in view of the difficulties regarding food and accommodation, it was so decided.&quot; Eisenhower&#x27;s JCS superiors ordered him to change German POWs&#x27; designation to &quot;disarmed enemy forces&quot; (DEF), just as British chiefs had done, redesignating their prisoners &quot;Surrendered Enemy Personnel&quot; (SEP). Alexander then requested that the CCS let British forces use such a designation for the surrender of German forces in Italy, the CCS granted his request and the conditions of such surrenders to British commander General Sir William D. Moran almost prevented the surrenders from occurring for worried German troops. The CCS submitted the DEF designations for study to the Combined Civilian Affairs Committee (CCAC), which not only concurred with the designation, but went further, suggesting that the status of all German POWs be retroactively lifted after the German surrender.

By June 22, 1945, of the 7,614,914 prisoners (of all designations) held in British and American camps, 4,209,000 were soldiers captured before the German capitulation and considered &quot;POWs&quot;. This leaves approximately 3.4 million DEFs and SEPs, who according to Allied agreements, were supposed to be split between Britain and the United States. As of June 16, 1945, the U.S., France, and the U.K. held a combined total of 7,500,000 German POWs and DEFs. By June 18, the U.S. had discharged 1,200,000 of these.

==Aftermath==

After the DEF designations were made in the early summer of 1945, the International Red Cross was not permitted to fully involve itself in the situation in camps containing German prisoners (POWs, DEFs or SEPs), some of which initially were Rheinwiesenlager transit camps, and even though conditions in them gradually improved, &quot;even the most conservative estimates put the death toll in French camps alone at over 16,500 in 1945&quot;.

The Geneva Convention was amended. Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Geneva July 27, 1929, had covered what may and may not be done to a prisoner on &quot;capture&quot;. The wording of the 1949 Third Geneva Convention was intentionally altered from that of the 1929 convention so that soldiers who &quot;fall into the power&quot; following surrender or mass capitulation of an enemy are now protected as well as those &quot;captured&quot; in the course of fighting.

Most captives of the Americans and the British were released by the end of 1948, and most of those in French and Soviet captivity were released by the end of 1949, although the last big release occurred in 1956. According to the section of the German Red Cross dealing with tracing the captives, the ultimate fate of 1,300,000 German POWs in Allied custody (mostly American) is still unknown; they are still officially listed as missing.

==Historical precedents==

After defeating Poland in 1939, and also after the defeat of Yugoslavia two years later, many troops from those nations were &quot;released&quot; from POW status and turned into a &quot;virtual conscript labor force&quot;.

Germany had either broken up or absorbed the countries in question, and the German argument was that neither country remained as a recognized state to which the POWs could still claim to belong, and that since belonging to a recognized nation was a formal prerequisite for POW status, &quot;former Polish and Yugoslav military personnel were not legally prisoners of war&quot;.

The Allied argument for retracting Geneva convention protection from the German soldiers was similar to that of Nazi Germany &quot;vis à vis&quot; Polish and Yugoslav soldiers; using the &quot;disappearance of the Third Reich to argue that the convention no longer operated-that POW status did not apply to the vast majority who had passed into captivity on and after May 5&quot;. The motive was twofold: both an unwillingness to follow the Geneva convention now that the threat of German reprisals against Allied POWs was gone, and also they were &quot;to an extent unable to meet the high standards of the Geneva code&quot; for the large number of captured Germans.

Following the surrender of Italy to the Allies in September 1943, German forces took around one million Italian military personnel prisoner. These personnel were designated &quot;Italian military internees&quot; and not granted the rights of POWs under the Geneva Conventions, as the German government claimed that they were not POWs as the two countries had not been at war. This continued, despite Italy’s subsequent declaration of war on Germany on October 13, 1943. Approximately 600,000 of the captured Italians were subsequently transported to Germany and required to work as forced labourers in generally harsh conditions.

<doc id="948409" wikidata="Q712849" url="?curid=948409" title="National Chengchi University">
<text>National Chengchi University () is a public research university in Taipei, Taiwan. The university is also considered as the earliest public service training facility of Taiwan. First established in Nanjing in 1927, the university was subsequently relocated to Taipei and resumed full operation in 1954 as the first re-established &quot;National University&quot; in Taiwan. 

The university, abbreviated as NCCU, specializes in arts and humanities, mass media, linguistics and literature, social sciences, economics, management, politics, and international affairs. It is the only publicly-funded university in Taiwan to provide courses in advertising, diplomacy, and several languages that are not taught at other institutions in Taiwan. The name &quot;Chengchi&quot; () means governance or politics, and refers to its founding in 1927 as a training institution for senior civil servants for the Nanjing Nationalist government of the Republic of China. The university has ties with academic institutions like Academia Sinica, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University and the National Palace Museum. 

The NCCU is also a member of the University System of Taiwan and University Alliance in Talent Education Development (UAiTED).

==History==

The school was established in 1927 in Nanjing, which was the capital city of China, as the Nationalist Party of China&#x27;s Central School of Party Affairs to train Party cadre. In 1929, it was renamed to Central School of Governance, after the Kuomintang reunified China in the Northern Expedition campaign. The school was built on the basis of National Central University in Nanjing, which was the highest academic institution of the Republic of China. In 1946, it merged with the Central School of Cadre, which was founded in 1944 by the Youth Corps of Three People&#x27;s Principles in Chongqing. The merged school was named the National Central University of Governance, based in Nanjing. When the Nationalist government lost control of mainland China in 1949, the university&#x27;s activities were suspended.

The university was reopened in 1954 as National Chengchi University in Taipei by the Executive Yuan, in order to meet the needs of civil service and the growing demands of higher education in Taiwan. Initially only graduate students were admitted, later in 1955, the school started to offer places to undergraduate students. In 1960, the university awarded the very first Doctor of Juridical Science degree in the Republic of China. In 1964, the school initiated the first-ever Mandarin-based Chinese Master of Business Administration program in the world.

Traditionally, as a modern institution training for public servants, NCCU is considered one of the leading institutions of the Republic of China. Today, the school is one of the top universities in Taiwan, and it also has been elected as the &quot;Aim for the Top University Project&quot; sponsored school of the Ministry of Education.

In 2014, the Embassy of Japan in Taiwan listed NCCU as one of the seven well-known Taiwanese universities.

In December 2019, NCCU established its first overseas office in Bangkok, Thailand. 

==Organization==

NCCU has 12 colleges, including colleges of Commerce, Communication, Foreign Languages and Literature, Education, International Affairs, Law, Liberal Arts, Science, Social Sciences, International Innovation, Global Banking and Finance and Informatics, encompassing 34 departments and 48 graduate institutes.

* The College of Commerce is ranked as a top business school by Eduniversal and is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and the European Quality Improvement System. In addition, the college is a member of The Partnership in International Management.
* The College of Foreign Languages and Literature offers distinctive academic programs on Slavic languages and literature, Arabic languages and literature and Turkish language and culture. Arabic languages and literature and Turkish language and culture are the faculties which exist only in NCCU in Taiwan. Dual degrees in Korean language with Sungkyunkwan University and Hanyang University have been offered since 2013. The college also is awarded by the Academy of Korean Studies for the &quot;Core University Program for Korean Studies&quot; and receive support from the government of the Republic of Korea.

<text>Kim Emil Jörgen Johnsson (born March 16, 1976) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman who played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks. He played six seasons for the Malmö Redhawks in the Swedish Elitserien prior to his NHL career.

==Playing career==
Johnsson was selected 286th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, the last pick in that draft. After playing two seasons with the Rangers, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers on August 20, 2001, along with Jan Hlaváč, Pavel Brendl, and a third-round pick in exchange for Eric Lindros. After four seasons with the Flyers, Johnsson signed a four-year contract with the Minnesota Wild on July 1, 2006. On February 12, 2010, Johnsson and Nick Leddy were traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for Cam Barker. He played 8 regular season games for Chicago before getting injured. Johnsson missed the remaining 14 regular season games and all 22 playoff games because of a concussion. While the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup that year, Johnsson did not play 41 games for Chicago, and Chicago did not request his name be included among the 52 names engraved on the Stanley Cup. Johnsson never played again after suffering his concussion.

As of 2020, Johnsson has returned to private life. Scott Powers of &quot;The Athletic&quot; attempted to reach Johnsson, but he declined an interview via his agent; Johnsson did, however, reveal that he returned to full health following his concussion.

<text>The Hockenheimring Baden-Württemberg () is a motor racing circuit situated in the Rhine valley near the town of Hockenheim in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, located on the Bertha Benz Memorial Route. Amongst other motor racing events, it has hosted the German Grand Prix, most recently in 2019. The circuit has very little differences in elevation. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 licence.

==History==
===1932–1938===
Originally called &quot;Dreieckskurs&quot; (triangle course), the Hockenheimring was built in 1932. The man behind it is Ernst Christ, a young timekeeper who felt that a racing track should be built in his hometown of Hockenheim. He submitted the plans to the mayor and they were approved on Christmas day, in 1931. This first layout of the track was around twelve kilometres long and consisted of a large triangle-like section, a hairpin in the city and two straights connecting them.

===1938–1965===

In 1938, the circuit dramatically shortened, from twelve kilometres down to just over seven and a half, and the Ostkurve corner, which lasted until 2001, was introduced for the first time. In that year, the track was also renamed to &quot;Kurpfalzring&quot;. The track was damaged by tanks during World War II. After the war, the track was repaired, and renamed to &quot;Hockenheimring&quot;. Former DKW and NSU factory rider and world record setter Wilhelm Herz became the manager of the track in 1954 and promoted the track successfully; Grand Prix motorcycle racing events were held, with the German motorcycle Grand Prix alternating between the Hockenheimring and other tracks. This version of the circuit was just over seven and a half kilometres long and consisted of the original two long straights, with the Ostkurve in the forest and the original hairpin inside Hockenheim joining them together.

===1965–2001===
In 1965, when the new Autobahn A 6 separated the village from the main part of the track, a new version of Hockenheim circuit was built, with the &quot;Motodrom&quot; stadium section, designed by John Hugenholtz, who also designed Suzuka. After Jim Clark was killed on 7 April 1968 in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added and the track was lined with crash barriers in 1970. A small memorial was placed near the first chicane (which was named after him), at the site of his accident. In 1982, another chicane was added at the Ostkurve (&quot;east curve&quot;), after Patrick Depailler was killed there in 1980, and the first chicane was made slower as well. For the 1992 German Grand Prix, the Ostkurve was changed yet again, from a quick left turn into a more complex right-left-right chicane, after Érik Comas crashed there in 1991. The second chicane was renamed after Ayrton Senna, after his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

This version used to be quite large, with a very long and very fast section going through forests essentially consisting of four straights of roughly , separated by a chicane sequence, followed by a more tight and twisty &quot;stadium&quot; section (so called because of all the grandstands situated there) named &quot;Motodrom&quot;. This made the setting up of racing cars difficult, since a choice had to be made – whether to run low downforce to optimize speed through the straights and compromise grip in the stadium section, or, run more downforce to optimize grip through the stadium section and compromise speed on the straights. The long track length also meant that a typical Formula One race had only 45 laps, limiting the spectators&#x27; experience of the race to only that many passes through the stadium.

During the mid-1980s &quot;turbo era&quot; of Formula One where fuel was restricted to either 220 (1984–1985), 195 (1986–1987) or 150 (1988) litres for races for the turbo powered cars, Hockenheim also saw drivers, including World Champion Alain Prost, at times fail to finish due to simply running out of fuel near the end of the race. Prost ran out at the end of the 1986 race, pushing his McLaren towards the line before giving up. He was placed 3rd when he ran dry and was eventually classified 6th, gaining a valuable championship point that would help him with his second World Championship.

Many problems came to light during the 2000 German Grand Prix, which was won by Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello from having started 18th on the grid. The race finished in changeable weather conditions, with pouring rain in the stadium sector and almost completely dry forest straights. All the overtaking moves that took place during the race were in the chicanes of the forest sector, meaning hardly any spectators saw most of the best action. Midway through the race, a former Mercedes-Benz employee, who had been dismissed, breached the track&#x27;s security barriers on the first forest straight, showing vulnerable security facilities in the forest and leading to the deployment of the safety car that neutralized a comfortable lead for the two Mercedes-powered McLarens. Later on, French driver Jean Alesi collided with Brazilian Pedro Diniz in the braking zone for the third chicane and his car spun uncontrollably down the track, which caused him to suffer dizziness for three days.

These events prompted much protest from the FIA to greatly improve spectator viewing, safety, and security at the track, claiming that the track was no longer suited to modern Formula One racing.

===2002 redesign===


In the early 2000s, F1 officials demanded the track be shortened and threatened to discontinue racing there, threatening to relocate to other tracks such as the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and sites in Asia. The state government of Baden-Württemberg secured the financing for the redesign by Hermann Tilke for the 2002 German Grand Prix. The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Turn 1 (&quot;Nordkurve&quot;). However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners. More than half of the first straight and almost all of the straight between the Ostkurve and Senna chicane were cut and the rest was connected with a new long straight called the &quot;Parabolika&quot;, with a small kink being added between the first straight and the new one. A small right-left-right complex was added to the remaining part of the final straight, with a new grandstand overlooking it. In an extremely controversial move, the old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events.

There was and still remains a great deal of criticism of the track redesign, in terms of ruining the previous unique technical challenges of the old Hockenheim circuit and delivering a new homogenised &quot;assembly line&quot; circuit without the character of the previous layout, whilst being beset by the perceived problems of other Tilke circuits. Several drivers and team principals, including Ron Dennis, Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya, criticised the changes and stated their preference for the old circuit.

The change in the track layout also saw the installation of a new memorial to Jim Clark. This is located at the outside of the current track&#x27;s turn 2, where the old track continued out into the forests, and the new shortened track turns to the right.

The new track has a seating capacity of 120,000, due to new large grandstands sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. The complex also features a quarter-mile track for drag racing. It hosts one of the largest drag racing events in Europe, known as the &quot;NitrOlympx&quot;, and was one of the last Top Fuel circuits to race to before the FIA switched the nitro categories to the now-recognised distance in 2012.

==Formula One==
The Hockenheim Circuit hosted the German Grand Prix for the first time in 1970 when the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the allegedly dangerous Nürburgring unless major changes were made. The next year the German Grand Prix went back to the Nürburgring until the 1976 German Grand Prix. From to , the Hockenheimring hosted the German Grand Prix with the exception of 1985, when the race was held at the reconfigured Nürburgring.

In July 2006, Bernie Ecclestone announced that from 2007 onwards, there would be only one Grand Prix per year in Germany. Since , there had been two Grands Prix every year in Germany; the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, plus either the European Grand Prix or the Luxembourg Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. From 2007, the Nürburgring and Hockenheimring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix, starting with the Nürburgring in 2007.

Ongoing deficits of the Formula One races, amounting to up to 5.3 million Euro per race that had to be covered by the local communities, made it likely the contract between the Hockenheimring and Formula One Management would not be extended after the Grand Prix of 2010. However, in October 2009 the contract for the circuit to hold the German GP was extended to 2018, with the FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs. Neither Hockenheim nor the Nürburgring hosted a Grand Prix in 2015 or 2017 after the Nürburgring failed to complete an agreement with Formula 1&#x27;s commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.
2019 was the last time the facility hosted the German Grand Prix, which was sponsored by Mercedes-Benz, celebrating the German manufacturer 125th year in motorsport.

==Drag racing (NitrolympX – Rico Anthes Quartermile)==
From 1986 to 1988, the start–finish straight was used for 1/8 mile drag racing. In 1989, a proper drag strip was built by connecting the Opel-Kurve and the first turn entering the Motodrom section. The finish line was at the beginning of the forest, with a very long run-off on the straight in the forest. Competitors had to travel around the full race track in opposite direction to return to the paddock.

The drag strip is only used for two events in August, the &quot;Public Race Days&quot; and the &quot;&quot; main event a week later. Originally named the &quot;Nitrolympics&quot; and featuring Top Fuel dragsters, it was renamed to NitrolympX.

When the Hockenheimring was shortened in 2002, the drag strip was moved back, closer to the new tall Tower stands that allow an unusual view along the drag strip. Even though the run off was cut in half it remains one of the longest in drag racing. The NitrolympX usually host most European Drag Racing Championship, sanctioned by FIA or FIM, plus jet dragsters and other entertaining events on the Saturday night show that draws 40,000 spectators.

The drag strip in 2008 was christened &quot;Rico Anthes Quartermile&quot; after the German former Top Fuel driver and long-time organizer of the NitrolympX had retired in 2007. As the dragstrip can only be prepared for professional drag racing after the last major circuit event, mainly the Formula One race, the grip is often sub par compared to permanent drag strips that host two Euro Championship events each year, like Santa Pod Raceway in England or Tierp Arena in Sweden. The best performances on the full quarter-mile were significantly below those in Santa Pod, and the best ET was set in 2005: 4.873 sec. and 458 km/h by Brady Kalivoda (USA).

In 2012, some Pro classes could not find traction as Formula One had demanded a new surface. In subsequent years, the organizers provided a better track, with support from Santa Pod personnel and machinery. In 2016, Hockenheim, and mainland Europe, finally saw the first 3-second Top Fuel 1000 ft passes, with 3.939 sec. and by Anita Mäkelä (FIN). An overall European record for Super Street Bike was set by Garry Bowe (GB) with 7.04s .

==DTM==
The DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series has regularly raced at the Hockenheimring since its revival in 2000. In most years, the DTM has competed there twice during a season.

==Rallycross==
Located in the stadia section of the track, the rallycross track uses a section of track from turns 11 to 16, combined with a dirt section in front of the grandstands. It hosted first ever World RX of Hockenheim, round 2 of FIA World Rallycross Championship in 2015 as supporting event of DTM. WRX also combined with the DTM for an event there in 2017.

<text>NGC 5866 (also called the Spindle Galaxy or possibly [[Messier 102]]) is a lenticular galaxy in the constellation Draco. NGC 5866 was most likely discovered by Pierre Méchain or Charles Messier in 1781, and independently found by William Herschel in 1788.
Measured orbital velocities of its globular cluster system
imply that dark matter makes up only of the mass within 5 effective radii,
a notable paucity.

==Dust lane==
One of the most outstanding features of NGC 5866 is the extended dust disk, which is seen almost exactly edge-on. This dust lane is highly unusual for a lenticular galaxy. The dust in most lenticular galaxies is generally found only near the nucleus and generally follows the light profile of the galaxies&#x27; bulges. This dust disk may contain a ring-like structure, although the shape of this structure is difficult to determine given the edge-on orientation of the galaxy. It is also possible that the galaxy is a spiral galaxy that was misclassified as a lenticular galaxy because of its edge-on orientation, in which case the dust lane would not be too unusual.

==Galaxy group information==
NGC 5866 is one of the brightest galaxies in the NGC 5866 Group, a small galaxy group that also includes the spiral galaxies NGC 5879 and NGC 5907. This group may actually be a subclump at the northwest end of a large, elongated structure that comprises the M51 Group and the M101 Group, although most sources distinguish the three groups as separate entities.

<text>Robert Lamb Sproull (August 16, 1918 – October 9, 2014) was an American educator, physicist and US Department of Defense official.

== Life and career ==
Sproull was born in Lacon, Illinois. A graduate of Deep Springs College, Sproull studied English literature at Cornell University before taking a PhD at the same university in physics. He began a promising and productive career as a physicist at Cornell and headed the Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics (LASSP) and the Materials Science Center. Sproull left Cornell to become director of ARPA, where he was a strong advocate of cooperation among academia, government, and industry to meet US scientific needs for defense and competition with the Soviet Union.

After taking up an administrative post at Cornell, he became provost and vice president of the University of Rochester in 1968. While at Rochester, he also served on Cornell&#x27;s board of trustees. In 1970, he became Rochester&#x27;s president, and the trustees voted in 1974 to make him the university’s chief executive officer. He retired as president and became professor of physics at the university in 1985. He served on the board of the George C. Marshall Institute. He was chairman of the Defense Science Board.

<text>Messier 102 (also known as M102) is a galaxy listed in the Messier Catalogue that cannot be unambiguously identified. Its original discoverer Pierre Méchain retracted his discovery two years after publication and said that it was a duplicate observation of Messier 101. Later historical evidence favors that M102 is actually the galaxy NGC 5866, although other galaxies have been suggested as possible identities. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) considers it to be the same as NGC 5866.

== History ==

The Messier Catalogue was a list of astronomical objects compiled by Charles Messier between 1771 and 1781, in which he briefly described each object and provided their coordinates on the sky. Because Messier was only interested in finding comets, he created this list of non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them. Astronomer Pierre Méchain collaborated with Messier on the compilation of his list.

M102 was observed by Méchain in late March or early April 1781 and was added by Messier to the final version of his catalogue published in 1781. However, Messier did not include the coordinates of M102 on his catalogue, leading to confusion about the exact object they observed. His description of the object was the following:

In 1783, Méchain retracted his discovery in a letter written to J. Bernoulli and claimed that M102 was actually an accidental duplication of M101 in the catalog. This letter was later published twice: First in original French in the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy for 1782, and second in German translation and somewhat rearranged by Johann Elert Bode in the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch for 1786.

==Candidate corresponding objects==
Since the publication of the Messier Catalogue, a number of galaxies have been identified by different historians, professional astronomers, and amateur astronomers as corresponding to M102.

===Messier 101===

Messier 101 (also known as the &quot;Pinwheel Galaxy&quot; or &quot;NGC 5457&quot;) is a face-on spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. In a letter written in 1783 to J. Bernoulli, Pierre Méchain (who had shared information about his discoveries with Messier) claimed that M102 was actually an accidental duplication of M101 in the catalog. This letter was later published twice: First in original French in the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy for 1782, and second in German translation and somewhat rearranged by Johann Elert Bode in the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch for 1786.
===NGC 5866===

NGC 5866 (one of two galaxies commonly called the &quot;Spindle Galaxy&quot;) is a lenticular galaxy in the constellation Draco. This galaxy appears to closely match both the object description (by Pierre Méchain) in the printed version of the Messier Catalog of 1781, and the object position given by Charles Messier in hand-written notes on his personal list of the Messier Catalogue.
===Other possible corresponding objects===
Although M101 and NGC 5866 are considered to be the two most likely candidates for M102, a few other objects have been suggested as potentially corresponding to this entry.

====NGC 5879, NGC 5907, NGC 5908 ====
NGC 5879, NGC 5907, NGC 5905, and NGC 5908 are all galaxies near the position of NGC 5866. By that criterion, they may all be as likely as NGC 5866 to be the objects that correspond to M102. However, none of these galaxies are as bright or as high in surface brightness as NGC 5866, so it is less likely that these objects correspond to M102.

====NGC 5928====
NGC 5928 is a 14th magnitude galaxy located between ο Boötis and ι Serpentis. J. L. E. Dreyer, in his &quot;Notes and Corrections&quot; to the New General Catalogue, suggested that this may have been the source identified as M102 on the basis that ι Serpentis may have been misidentified as ι Draconis in the location given for the object. However, it may not have been observable by Messier and Méchain, since even the faintest objects in Messier&#x27;s catalogue are of roughly 10th magnitude, so it is unlikely to correspond to M102.

<text>Fell terrier refers to a regional type of long-legged working terrier, not a specific breed of dog.

== Description and purpose ==
Fell terriers are types of small working terriers developed in the fell country of Northern England and used as hunting dogs. They may be crossbred or purebred. Fell terrier types are typically small, usually 10- 15 lbs/6.5 kg, and with a narrow chest, so as to fit into the tunnels of the animals they hunt. Fell terriers are long-legged, with a rough textured coat, often red or black in colour. The tail traditionally is docked; in the United States the tail is not required to be docked. Crossbreeding with other hunting terriers in the beginning caused the appearance to vary.

Fell terriers are bred for hunting ability and gameness rather than to a standard of appearance (breed type). They hunt in packs or alone. The fell terrier was originally developed by Ullswater Hunt Master Joe Bowman, an early Border Terrier breeder, where he used the best red fell terriers available to him, so that he could continue his efforts to refine the fell terrier even further to hunt the large fell fox that was believed to cause serious losses for sheep stockmen. The dog needed long legs to follow hunters through heavy snow, and a narrow chest to follow the fox in a stony underground den. In the hunt, a terrier follows the red fox underground into its den, where it either kills the fox, bolts it or holds it until the hunter (terrierman) digs the dog and fox up. The original fell terrier bloodlines extend down from Harry Hardisty Turk and Sid Wilkinson&#x27;s Rock, Wilkinson&#x27;s Rock the most important stud dog of his Era bred down from Fred Barker and Anthony Barker&#x27;s chowt-face rock terriers. Others who have contributed are Garry Middleton, 
Brian Nuttall, John Park, Ken Gould, Frank Buck, Cyril Breay, Joe Armstrong, Anthony Barker, Fred Barker, Maurice Bell, Anthony Chapman, John Cowen, Tommy Dobson, Eddie Pool, Graham Ward, and Sid Wilkinson. Fell terriers have been used in the United States for several generations hunting small game and have been known under the name Patterdale terrier. For the most part remain unchanged by the hunter who keeps the standard.

== Breeds ==
Several named breeds have been developed from the fell terrier type, such as the Border Terrier, Lakeland Terrier, Patterdale Terrier, scorrier terrier, Welsh Terrier, and other locally developed breeds. All are sometimes called &quot;fell terrier&quot; interchangeably with their breed name. The &quot;National Terriers Club LLC&quot;, The &quot;American Fell Terrier International&quot; has published a Fell Terrier standard. In Germany, the Jagdterrier was developed out of Fell terrier stock in the 1920s. Fell terriers may be descended from a very old type of long-legged terrier referred to as the rough-coated Black and Tan, similar to today&#x27;s Welsh Terrier.

<doc id="948432" wikidata="Q1227176" url="?curid=948432" title="Diplexer">
<text>A diplexer is a passive device that implements frequency-domain multiplexing. Two ports (e.g., L and H) are multiplexed onto a third port (e.g., S). The signals on ports L and H occupy disjoint frequency bands. Consequently, the signals on L and H can coexist on port S without interfering with each other.

Typically, the signal on port L will occupy a single low frequency band and the signal on port H will occupy a higher frequency band. In that situation, the diplexer consists of a lowpass filter connecting ports L and S and high pass filter connecting ports H and S. Ideally, all the lowband signal power on port L is transferred to the S port and vice versa. All the highband signal power on port H is transferred to port S and vice versa. Ideally, the separation of the signals is complete. None of the low band signal is transferred from the L port to the H port. In the real world, some power will be lost, and some signal power will leak to the wrong port.

The diplexer, being a passive device, is normally reciprocal: the device itself doesn&#x27;t have a notion of input or output. However poorly designed diplexers may have differing impedance on various ports, so it should not simply be assumed that any such device is fully reciprocal unless it is stated or the return loss measured.

The diplexer is a different device than a passive combiner or splitter. The ports of a diplexer are frequency selective; the ports of a combiner are not. There is also a power &quot;loss&quot; difference - a combiner takes all the power delivered to the S port and equally divides it between the A and B ports. A diplexer does not.

A diplexer frequency multiplexes two ports onto one port, but more than two ports may be multiplexed. A three-port to one-port multiplexer is known as a triplexer, and a four-port to one-port multiplexer is a quadplexer or quadruplexer.

A typical diplexer may have around 30 dB isolation between its L and H ports. That isolation is sufficient for many applications, but it is insufficient to allow simultaneous reception and transmission on one antenna. If the transmitter emits 1 kW, then 1 W of that signal would appear at the receiver; that 1 W may be enough power to overload the receiver. Diplexers designed for simultaneous reception and transmission have more stringent isolation requirements and are known as duplexers.

==Common uses==
A diplexer allows two different devices to share a common communications channel. Typically, the channel is a long coaxial cable, and a diplexer is often used at both ends of the coaxial cable. The plan is feasible if the two devices operate on different frequencies. The plan is economical if the diplexers cost less than running a second cable.

Diplexers are typically used with radio receivers or transmitters on different, widely separated, frequency bands. A single city radio tower might have a police department antenna on 460 MHz and a fire department antenna on 156 MHz. A diplexer at the top combines the two antenna signals to the single coaxial feedline, and a second identical diplexer inside the building separates the feedline signals to the two dispatch radios. Some diplexers support as many as four antennas or radios that work on different radio bands.

Diplexers are also commonly used where a multi-band antenna is used on a tower, with a common feedline. The diplexer will split the two bands inside the building (such as VHF and UHF systems combined with a diplexer onto a common antenna).

==Industrial applications==
Diplexing is used to prevent intermodulation and keep reflected power (VSWR) to a minimum for each input transmitter and frequency. While diplexers can combine a relatively wide bandwidth, the major limitation comes with the antenna itself, which must be sufficiently wideband to accept all of the signals being passed through it, and transfer them to the air efficiently.

Typically with a multi-band antenna the frequencies in use will bear an odd harmonic relationship to each other to take advantage of natural harmonic resonances (such as 145/435 MHz), making a highly efficient multi-band antenna. Other times tuned traps will be used, which is less efficient and generally not a technique used at VHF/UHF.

Many other large UHF-/VHF-transmitters use diplexers. The number of transmitters which can share an antenna is restricted by the spacing of their frequency bands. Transmitters whose frequencies are too close together cannot be combined successfully by a diplexer.

Diplexers are also used at medium wave broadcasting stations. However their use is not that common in this frequency range because the corresponding wavelength varies much more across the medium wave band than across the FM band and so it is more practicable to use a separate antenna for each frequency: medium wave transmission sites usually broadcast only on one to four frequencies, while FM-broadcasting sites often uses four and more frequencies.

Diplexers may be used as a back-up device. An example is maintenance work at one antenna of a medium wave transmission site that has two antennas transmitting on two frequencies. Then the other antenna can be used for broadcasting both channels. If it is not possible to build a second antenna for the second transmitter due to space constraints, then the diplexer is used permanently.

At long wave broadcasting sites diplexers are normally not used since these stations usually broadcast on only one frequency. A realization of diplexers for long wave broadcasting stations may be difficult, as the ratio of bandwidth (9 kHz) to transmission frequency is high.

Diplexers are not used at VLF transmitters. In this frequency range their realization is very difficult because of the very high voltages that occur in the huge tuned loading coils that are used in the antenna feed.

Diplexers are also used for non-broadcast applications such as amateur radio.

==Residential==
Diplexers are also used in the home to allow a direct broadcast satellite TV dish antenna and a terrestrial TV antenna (local broadcast channels) to share one coaxial cable. The dish antenna occupies the high frequencies (typically 950 to 1450 MHz), and the TV antenna uses lower television channel frequencies (typically 50 to 870 MHz). In addition, the satellite also gets a DC to low frequency band to power the dish&#x27;s block converter and select the dish antenna polarization (e.g., voltage signaling or DiSEqC). The diplexer is useful in homes that are already wired with one cable, because it eliminates the need to install a second cable. For the diplexer to work, the existing cable must be able to pass the satellite frequencies with little loss. Older TV installations may use a solid dielectric RG-59 cable, and that cable may be inadequate. RG-6 cable is typically used for satellite feed lines.

In this application, there would be a diplexer on the roof that joins the satellite dish feed and the TV antenna together into a single coaxial cable. That cable would then run from the roof into the house. At a convenient point, a second diplexer would split the two signals apart; one signal would go to the TV set and the other to the IRD of the DBS set-top box. These usually have an antenna input and a diplexer, so that the antenna signal is also distributed along with the satellite.

More modern installations confront several issues. There are often multiple satellite dishes that need to feed several receivers or even multichannel receivers. See, for example, single cable distribution.

Diplexers were also used to combine UHF TV and VHF TV and FM signals onto one downlead, which can then be split back into its component parts as required.

<text>Mazdak (, Middle Persian: 𐭬𐭦𐭣𐭪, also Mazdak the Younger; died c. 524 or 528) was an Iranian Zoroastrian &quot;mobad&quot; (priest) and religious reformer who gained influence during the reign of the Sasanian emperor Kavadh I. He claimed to be a prophet of Ahura Mazda and instituted social welfare programs.

==Mazdakism==
Mazdak was the chief representative of a religious and philosophical teaching called Mazdakism, which he viewed as a reformed and purified version of Zoroastrianism, although his teaching has been argued to display influences from Manichaeism, the Carpocratians, and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; as well. Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion of Sassanid Persia, and Mazdak himself was a mobad or Zoroastrian priest, but most of the clergy regarded his teaching as heresy. Surviving documentation is scarce. Some further details may be inferred from the later doctrine of the Khurramites, which has been seen as a continuation of Mazdakism.

===Origins===
Some sources claim that the original founders of this sect lived earlier than Mazdak. These were another mobad, Zaradust-e Khuragen (distinct from the founder of Zoroastrianism, Zoroaster, Middle Persian &quot;Zardusht&quot;) and/or a Zoroastrian philosopher known as Mazdak the Elder, who taught a combination of altruism and hedonism: &quot;he directed his followers to enjoy the pleasures of life and satisfy their appetite in the highest degree with regard to eating and drinking in the spirit of equality, to aim at good deeds; to abstain from shedding blood and inflicting harm on others; and to practise hospitality without reservation&quot;. This doctrine was further developed by the much better-known Mazdak the Younger, son of Bāmdād.

At later stages the conservative Zoroastrian opposition accused Mazdak&#x27;s followers of heresy and with abhorrent practices such as the sharing of women, for which scholars have found no evidence. Mazdak&#x27;s followers are considered to be the first real socialists in human history by their emphasis on community property and community work with benefits accruing to all.

===Theological tenets===
Like both Zoroastrianism (at least as practised at the time) and Manichaeism, Mazdakism had a dualistic cosmology and worldview. This doctrine taught that there were two original principles of the universe: Light, the good one; and Darkness, the evil one. These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, tainting everything except God. Light is characterized by knowledge and feeling, and acts by design and free will, whereas Darkness is ignorant and blind, and acts at random. Mankind&#x27;s role in this life was, through good conduct, to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. But where Manichaeism saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.

In addition, Mazdakism is reported, in one late work, to have distinguished three elements (Fire, Water, Earth), and four Powers (Discernment, Understanding, Preservation and Joy), corresponding to the four chief officials of the Sassanid state – the Chief Mobad (&quot;Mobadan Mobad&quot;), the Chief Herbad, the Commander of the Army and the Entertainment Master), seven Viziers and twelve Spiritual Forces. When the Four, the Seven and the Twelve were united in a human being, he was no longer subject to religious duties. In addition, God was believed to rule the world through letters, which held the key to the Great Secret that should be learned. This description suggests that Mazdakism was, in many ways, a typical Gnostic sect.

===Ethical and social principles===
Two distinguishing factors of Mazdak&#x27;s teaching were the reduction of the importance of religious formalities—the true religious person being the one who understood and related correctly to the principles of the universe—and a criticism of the strong position of mainstream clergy, who, he believed, had oppressed the Persian population and caused much poverty.

Mazdak emphasised good conduct, which involved a moral and ascetic life, no killing and vegetarianism (considering meat to contain substances derived solely from Darkness), being kind and friendly and living in peace with other people. In many ways Mazdak&#x27;s teaching can be understood as a call for social revolution, and has been referred to as early &quot;communism&quot;.

According to Mazdak, God had originally placed the means of subsistence on earth so that people should divide them among themselves equally, but the strong had coerced the weak, seeking domination and causing the contemporary inequality. This in turn empowered the &quot;Five Demons&quot; that turned men from Righteousness—these were Envy, Wrath, Vengeance, Need and Greed. To prevail over these evils, justice had to be restored and everybody should share excess possessions with his fellow men. Mazdak allegedly planned to achieve this by making all wealth common or by re-distributing the excess, although it is unclear how he intended to organize that in terms of regulations and to what extent his position has been caricatured by hostile sources. The hostile sources mostly dwell on the alleged &quot;sharing&quot; of women, the resulting sexual promiscuity and the confusion of the line of descent. Since the latter is a standard accusation against heretical sects, its veracity has been doubted by researchers; it is likely that Mazdak took measures against the widespread polygamy of the rich and lack of wives for the poor.

==Followers==
Mazdak&#x27;s teaching acquired many followers, to the point when even King Kavadh I, ruling from 488 until 531, converted to Mazdakism. He also reportedly sponsored its adoption by the Arab vassal kingdom of al-Hirah, entailing the deposing of the previous king al-Mundhir by the Kindite chief al-Harith.

With the King&#x27;s backing Mazdak could embark on a program of social reform, which involved pacifism, anti-clericalism and aid programs for helping the poor. Mazdak had government warehouses opened to help the poor. He also had all the Zoroastrian fire temples closed except the three major ones.

==Opposition to and purge of Mazdak&#x27;s adherents==
Fear among the nobility and Zoroastrian clergy grew so strong that King Kavadh was overthrown in 496, but he managed to regain the throne three years later with the help of the Hephthalite Empire.
Scared by the resistance among the powerful, he chose to distance himself from Mazdak. He allowed Anushiravan to launch a campaign against the Mazdakites in 524 or 528, culminating in a massacre of most of the adherents – including Mazdak himself – and restoring orthodox Zoroastrianism as the state religion. Various fictionalized accounts specify the manner of execution: for example, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; states that 3,000 Mazdakites were buried alive with the feet upwards in order to present the spectacle of a &quot;human garden&quot;, whereas Mazdak himself was hanged upside down and shot with countless arrows; other stories specify other torturous methods of execution. Anushiravan then proceeded to implement his own far-reaching social and administrative reforms. The Mazdakite ruler of al-Hirah was also overthrown and the previous king restored to power.

==Jewish tradition==
A Jewish tradition relates a slightly different story. The Exilarch of Babylon, Mar-Zutra II, rallied the Jewish community and their allies, who defeated Mazdak and established an independent Jewish kingdom in Mahoza that lasted for seven years 
(495–502).

== Historicity ==
The historicity of the persona of Mazdak has been questioned. He may have been a fabrication to take blame away from Kavad. Contemporary historians, including Procopius and Joshua the Stylite make no mention of Mazdak naming Kavad as the figure behind the movement. Mention of Mazdak only emerges in later Middle Persian Zoroastrian documents, namely the &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, the &quot;Denkard&quot;, and the &quot;Zand-i Wahman yasn&quot;. Later Islamic-era sources, particularly al-Tabari&#x27;s work, also mention Mazdak. These later writings were perhaps corrupted by Iranian oral folklore, given that blame put on Mazdak for the redistribution of aristocratic properties to the people, is a topic repeated in Iranian oral history. Other &quot;villains&quot; in Iranian history, namely Gaumata in the Behistun Inscription of the Achaemenid ruler Darius the Great (), and Wahnam in the Paikuli inscription of the Sasanian shah Narseh (), are frequently accused of similar misdeeds.

==Legacy==
A few Mazdakites survived and settled in remote areas. Small pockets of Mazdakite societies are said to have survived for centuries after the Muslim conquest of Persia. Their doctrines probably mixed with radical currents of Shia Islam, influencing them and giving rise to later powerful revolutionary-religious movements in the region. The cult of al-Muqanna‘, who claimed to be the incarnation of God and had followers among the Mubaiyyidah sect of Zoroastrianism and even some Turks, upheld the laws and institutes of Mazdak. In the 9th century, the Khurramites, an egalitarian religious sect possibly originating from Mazdakism, led a revolt under the leadership of Babak Khorramdin against the Abbasid Caliphate and successfully defended large territories against the Caliphate&#x27;s forces for some twenty years. The Batiniyya, Qarmatians and other later revolutionary currents of Islam may also be connected to Mazdakism and were often equated with it by contemporary authors.

Turkish scholar Abdülbâkî Gölpınarlı sees even the Qizilbash of the 16th century – a radical Shi&#x27;i movement in Persia which helped the Safaviyya establish Twelver Islam as the dominant religion of Iran – as &quot;spiritual descendants of the Khurramites&quot; and, hence, of the Mazdakites. &quot;Mazdakist&quot; eventually seems to have become a standard derogative label attached by pre-modern Persian and Arabic authors to any radical egalitarian movement in subsequent Iranian history. While medieval Muslim historiography primarily focused on the &quot;socialist&quot; aspects of Mazdak, Zoroastrian tradition, on the other hand, remembers Mazdak above all as a dangerous heretic and enemy of the true faith (&quot;Zand-i Wahman yasn&quot; 2:1).

The author of the &quot;Dabestan-e Mazaheb&quot;, writing as late as the 17th century, claims to have met individual adherents of Mazdakism who practised their religion secretly among the Muslims and preserved the &quot;Desnad&quot;, a book in Middle Persian containing the teachings of Mazdak.

Philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal, who inspired the Pakistan Movement in British India, termed Karl Marx as the modern reincarnation of Mazdakite thought. In the poem Ibless ki Majlis-e-Shura, he drew similarities between Marxism and Mazadak thought of redistribution of excess, reduction of the importance of religious formality, emancipation of love and social revolution. Iqbal describes Karl Marx as reincarnation of the soul of Mazdak. These views penned in 1936, when Russian Revolution was still fledgling, remained skeptical if Mazdakite logic of Marxism was the solution of problems of the poor and the downtrodden. Iqbal devotes a chapter on Mazdak in his PhD thesis with Munich University on The Development of Metaphysics in Persia.

<text>Operation Wigwam involved a single test of the Mark 90 &quot;Betty&quot; nuclear bomb. It was conducted between &quot;Operation Teapot&quot; and &quot;Project 56&quot; on May 14, 1955, about 500 miles (800 km) southwest of San Diego, California. 6,800 personnel aboard 30 ships were involved in &quot;Wigwam&quot;. The purpose of &quot;Wigwam&quot; was to determine the vulnerability of submarines to deeply detonated nuclear weapons, and to evaluate the feasibility of using such weapons in a combat situation. The task force commander, Admiral John Sylvester, was embarked on the task force flagship . &quot;Wigwam&quot; was the first atomic test in the deep ocean, and it remains the only test that has been conducted in water deeper than .

== Detonation layout and test ==
The test device was suspended to a depth of by cable attached to a barge. A tow line connected the Cherokee-class fleet tug, , to the shot barge. Suspended from the tow lines of other tugs were three miniature unmanned target submarines designated &quot;SQUAWS&quot;, each packed with cameras and telemetry instruments. Those targets were long, scale of the SS-563 prototype hull () to assess effects of the explosion on a submarine hull.

The time of detonation was 13:00 local Pacific Time (noon Pacific Standard Time).

The equipment intended for direct measurement of the explosion-generated underwater bubble was not operational at the time of the shot, but based on other measurements, the bubble&#x27;s maximum radius was calculated as , and its pulsation period approximately 2.83 seconds.

See also the table at List of United States&#x27; nuclear weapons tests.

== Underwater sound ==
The underwater sound from the Wigwam explosion was recorded on bottom-mounted hydrophones at Point Sur and Point Arena off California, and at Kāneʻohe Bay off Oahu, Hawaii. The sound emanating from the explosive test began as an intense water shock wave. As the sound traveled away from the test point, it reflected from topographic features, such as islands and seamounts, located throughout both the North and South Pacific Basins. The reflected sound was then recorded as hours-long coda at Kaneohe and Point Sur. Some of the acoustic energy travelled round trip distances of over . The sound signals provided one of the early measurements of underwater sound attenuation at low frequencies.

<text>Higham is a village in the Borough of Pendle in Lancashire, England, south of Pendle Hill. The civil parish is named Higham with West Close Booth. The village is north-east of Padiham and about south-west of Nelson along the A6068 road. 

According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the parish has a population of 778, a decrease from 808 in the 2001 census.

The parish adjoins the other Pendle parishes of Goldshaw Booth, Old Laund Booth and Reedley Hallows, the Burnley parishes of Ightenhill and Padiham, and the Ribble Valley parishes of Simonstone and Sabden. The area of the parish north of Stump Hall Road is part of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

==Governance==
Higham with West Close Booth was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Burnley Rural District from 1894. The township included a detached area south of the village of Fence, but this part transferred to Old Laund Booth in 1898. A part of the parish also transferred to Sabden on its creation in 1904. The neighbouring civil parish of North Town (historically associated with Padiham) was merged into Simonstone in 1983. However, after a public campaign to move Simonstone into the Borough of Ribble Valley and Boundary Commission review completed in 1985, a part of North Town lying north of the A6068 Padiham Bypass was added to this parish.

Along with Goldshaw Booth, Barley-with-Wheatley Booth and Roughlee Booth, the parish forms the Higham with Pendleside ward of Pendle Borough Council.

==Facilities==
The centre of Higham is a conservation area. The buildings in the area are stone-built, mainly from the 19th century with a few even older. Several farmhouses and barns have been converted to houses. Outside the Conservation Area most buildings are from later periods, including modern housing estates.

Amenities include a pub, the Four Alls Inn, est. 1798 where one can discover the meaning of &quot;Four Alls&quot;; the Church of St. John the Evangelist (C of E) built 1874, Higham C of E (Controlled) Primary School, and the Village Hall.

==Buildings and features==
The Spout is a feature in the centre of the village, providing constant natural spring water. Nearby is the historic site of a pinfold or poundfield, a walled area with grass and running water which was used to temporarily impound animals.

Other buildings of note include the village hall, 1837, which was built as the National School and also used for Church of England services until St. John&#x27;s Church was built. Higham Hall, 17th century, had been used for meetings of the court of the Forest of Pendle. Clover Croft Mill stood in the centre of the village, having latterly been used as a furniture factory. The demolition was completed in 2006 to enable a housing development to be built on the site.

On the road to Nelson are three buildings of interest: Lower White Lee (18th century), Higher White Lee birthplace of Jonas Moore (see below), Ashlar House has a porch dated 1594 with the names Richard Grimshaw and John Box, but the house seems to have been rebuilt in the 17th century.

==Notable residents==
*Herbert Butterworth (1902–1938) professional footballer, born in Higham.
*Harry Hargreaves (1896–1975) professional footballer, born in Higham.
*Jonas Moore (1617–1679) later Sir Jonas Moore FRS, was an English mathematician, surveyor, Ordnance officer and patron of astronomy, born at White Lee, now Higher White Lee Farm, Higham.
*The Pendle Witches. One of the families swept up in the Pendle Witch Trials of 1612 was the &#x27;Chattox&#x27; clan, based in West Close where the old crone Mother Chattox lived and her family pursued their work of professional begging. In Alizon Device&#x27;s confession she told that &quot;Anne Whittle, alias Chattox, was suspected for bewitching the drinke of John Moore of Higham, gentleman&quot; and for causing one of his sons to die. The landlord of the pub, The Four Alls, accused Chattox of putting a curse on his brew. The suspected witches were first examined at Ashlar House, by local Magistrate Roger Nowell of nearby Read Hall.

<doc id="948472" wikidata="Q6303518" url="?curid=948472" title="Judith Krantz's Till We Meet Again">
<text>Judith Krantz&#x27;s Till We Meet Again is a 1989 two-episode television miniseries based on the 1988 Judith Krantz novel, &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot;. Its stars include Mia Sara, Bruce Boxleitner, Hugh Grant, Maxwell Caulfield, and Courteney Cox.

The story revolves around Eve, Delphine and Frederique (Freddy), three young women who are looking to get themselves set up in a world that changes quickly. Along the way they find romance and become swept up in war, danger and family intrigue. Events from 1913 to 1952 are included.

==Plot==
===Part 1===
The story starts in Dijon in 1913. Eve (Lucy Gutteridge) is the daughter of a prominent doctor, and is destined to be married off to Roger Grillont (James Langton), but instead she falls in love with a low-class theater performer, Alain Marais (Maxwell Caulfield). Alain believes that she is an orphan from the same social class as him, and loses his interest after finding out that she is a rich, privileged girl. Nevertheless, she follows him to live in Paris, where her neighbor Vivianne de Biron (Juliet Mills) helps her land a job as a showgirl. Alain disapproves of her profession, comparing it with prostitution, following which she leaves him.

By 1915 World War I is in full motion. Eve meets Paul de Lancel (Michael York) while performing for the army and falls in love with him. Paul&#x27;s aristocratic family disapproves of Paul serving in the army, because it requires him to abandon his work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as his duties as a husband to Laure (Susannah Harker) and their newborn son Bruno. Laure is devastated by Paul&#x27;s absence and kills herself, after which her family swears revenge by keeping Bruno and raising him to hate his father. By 1917, Paul and Eve meet again in Paris and soon marry. She quits her career to support her husband&#x27;s political career.

In 1930, Paul is stationed as a Consul General at the Consulate in Los Angeles. Here, their daughter Freddy (Elisabeth Harnois) starts getting flying lessons from stunt flyer Terrence &#x27;Mac&#x27; McGuire (Barry Bostwick). By 1936, a now-teenaged Freddy (Courteney Cox) is an avid flyer and a tomboy. Her sister Delphine (Mia Sara), meanwhile, leads a reckless life with parties and alcohol. For the first time in their lives, they move to their home country of France to live with their grandparents at Chateau Valmont. They meet their half brother Bruno (Hugh Grant), who is now a political science student and a nazi sympathizer with a deep hatred for Paul. He reveals Eve&#x27;s scandalous showgirl past to Freddy and Delphine.

In 1937, Freddy and Delphine return to Los Angeles. A stubborn Freddy accepts a stunt job from movie stunt coordinator Swede Castelli (Denis Arndt) and is kicked out of the house by her father. She moves in with Mac and starts a relationship with him despite a 23-year age gap. Delphine, meanwhile, is jailed for her reckless party behavior and is sent back to France to live with her grandparents. There, she finds work as a movie actress and falls in love with Jewish movie director Armand Sadowski (Charles Shaughnessy). Bruno warns her that Armand will have the same fate as Jewish Germans as soon as the war breaks out, but Delphine continues to see him.

One day Freddy prepares for a stunt scene that Mac considers too dangerous. He replaces her last-minute, crashes the plane and dies.

===Part 2===
The year is 1940, and World War II is in full motion. Freddy is stationed as an army pilot in England and becomes good friends with co-pilot Jane Longbridge (Serena Gordon). She meets Jane&#x27;s older brother Tony (John Vickery) and soon marries him and becomes pregnant. Unbeknownst to her, Tony&#x27;s best man Jock Hampton (Bruce Boxleitner) is in love with her. Meanwhile, in France, Bruno takes over control of the chateau after the country surrenders to Germany and the family&#x27;s vineyard becomes occupied by the German army. Bruno happily collaborates with German Captain Ruttemann. Delphine desperately tries to find Armand, who was taken prisoner in Dunkirk. Bruno helps her set up a meeting with a German official to gather information but the official makes sexual advances which she rejects. Bruno is enraged at her for disrespecting the German army and violently rapes her.

Soon after, Bruno sets up a champagne trading business with the German army and is spotted by Charles Martin, a loyal worker who has been with De Lancels for decades. Bruno shoots and kills Charles in cold blood in front of Charles&#x27; son Edward (Nick Wright). Armand, meanwhile, is assigned to do labor work at the vineyard in Chateau Valmont where Eve recognizes him. When it turns out he has no vineyard skills he is to be sent off to a concentration camp. He and other prisoners revolt and manage to escape with help from Eve. He flees to Paris where he is reunited with Delphine. Paul, who was previously stationed in England, now serves the army in France and sees his wife for the first time in years. He tells her that Freddy has given birth to a daughter in England. At the chateau Paul learns of Bruno&#x27;s champagne trading business and orders him to leave the country. Bruno attempts to murder Paul but fails and leaves France.

After the war ends, Freddy moves back to Los Angeles, where she starts a business venture in aviation. She becomes a workaholic which comes at the cost of her marriage. Tony is unhappy and seeks comfort with alcohol and other women. Soon after he asks for a divorce and moves back to England. Jock, who is now working for Freddy, tells her that he has always loved her and was aware of Tony&#x27;s adultery. Freddy feels betrayed that Jock never told her anything about the mistresses and runs off to fly a plane. The plane crashes and she is seriously injured. Following her recovery she sells the shares of her company.

In 1952 Paul dies of a heart attack. Bruno interrupts his funeral to spit on his grave. There Edward recognizes him as his father&#x27;s killer. It also turns out that Bruno prepared a scheme that he would own the chateau after Paul&#x27;s death, following which he kicks Eve, Freddy and Delphine out. Edward takes revenge on Bruno by shooting and killing him; Bruno&#x27;s death is ruled as an accident. In the final scene Freddy, who was afraid to fly following her serious flying accident, conquers her fear of flying and kisses Jock.

<text>WABE-TV (channel 30) is a secondary PBS member television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Owned by Atlanta Public Schools, it is a sister outlet to NPR member station WABE (90.1 FM) and local educational access cable service APS Cable Channel 22. The three outlets share studios on Bismark Road in the Morningside/Lenox Park section of Atlanta; WABE-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on New Street Northeast (south of DeKalb Avenue) in the city&#x27;s Edgewood neighborhood.

WABE-TV was Georgia&#x27;s first public television station, signing on as WETV in February 1958, and is the only one that is not part of Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB). It has typically provided a programming mix more reflective of the city of Atlanta than the statewide service from GPB, though duplication between the two has been an issue at times in WABE-TV&#x27;s history.

==History==
The Board of Education of the City of Atlanta filed on February 16, 1953, for a construction permit to build a new noncommercial educational television station on Atlanta&#x27;s reserved channel 30. The Federal Communications Commission granted the application on March 21, 1956; the school board announced that the station would operate from the former Rock Springs School. After delays in tower construction set back the start, the station first signed on the air as WETV, for &quot;Educational Television&quot;, on February 17, 1958; test broadcasts had started at the end of 1957.

Channel 30, the first educational television station to sign on in Georgia, focused initially on programs for use in the city&#x27;s public schools. The initial offering consisted of five high school courses and two at the elementary school level. In addition, the station aired programs from National Educational Television and produced local specialty programming, including Board of Aldermen and Board of Education meetings and programs for senior citizens and Spanish speakers. In 1973, the station began broadcasting on Saturdays for the first time ever.

Parallel to WETV&#x27;s early years, the University of Georgia built WGTV, channel 8 in Athens, in 1960, and the Georgia Educational Television Network was constructed in the 1960s, providing service to the rest of the state. However, in the early 1980s, when WGTV was amalgamated with Georgia Educational Television to form the present Georgia Public Broadcasting, Governor George Busbee called for the state to negotiate to purchase WETV. The late 1970s and early 1980s also saw other changes: the formation of a Public Broadcasting Association to advise on the operations of WETV and WABE; upset workers who threatened a wildcat strike over work schedule issues; and Fulton County&#x27;s decision to stop funding WABE and WETV in 1982, which almost led the Atlanta school board to turn both over to GPB. Ultimately, the factor that dissuaded the Board of Education from handing over its broadcasting outlets was the fact that it was a minority school system and had no interest in turning over the services to a predominantly White group.

In 1984, seeking to improve its image, channel 30 changed its call letters to WPBA (&quot;Public Broadcasting Atlanta&quot;). The station periodically explored potential new directions, such as a 1991 study that suggested focusing on local productions and deemphasizing network shows; the same study also suggested a move to a multicultural format for WABE, which drew the ire of public broadcasting supporters. The advisory board campaigned in 1993 to take full control of the stations; this led to its restructuring as the Atlanta Educational Telecommunications Collaborative in 1994. After the handover, WPBA more than doubled its annual budget thanks to increased corporate and viewer donations, and its number of members tripled; however, much of this came from airing PBS programming, prompting more concern by some donors of overlap with GPB. The statewide network made another overture to take over WPBA and WABE, which the Atlanta Board of Education rebuffed, with the racial composition of channel 30&#x27;s management compared to the state agency again being cited. Milton Clipper, president and CEO of Public Broadcasting Atlanta, told the &quot;Atlanta Business Chronicle&quot;, &quot;We can certainly do interesting [programming] for the state as well, but that&#x27;s not where we&#x27;re heading right now. I want to make sure that I&#x27;m doing what I am responsible to do for our city.&quot;
On September 6, 1999, WPBA assumed time-lease rights to Atlanta Public Schools&#x27;s APS Cable channel (carried on Comcast channel 22 in metropolitan Atlanta), which began to air programming from the upstart PBS Kids Channel each night from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., with instructional programming acquired by the school district continuing to air during the daytime hours.

In 2005, WPBA heavily reduced its PBS program offerings after Atlanta Public Schools and station management decided to make channel 30 a participant in the service&#x27;s Program Differentiation Plan; this came amid frequent complaints of duplication between WPBA and GPB and a desire to cut costs at the station. As a result, the station began to carry only 25 percent of the programming broadcast by PBS&#x27;s national feed, giving GPB primary status for most new PBS programs. To make up for the reduced lineup of PBS shows, WPBA also expanded its reliance on syndicated programs from American Public Television and other distributors as well as locally produced news and public affairs programs.

On July 23, 2018, WPBA discontinued the &quot;PBA 30&quot; branding, used since the late 1990s, and changed its moniker to &quot;ATL PBA&quot;, removing references to its over-the-air virtual channel. The following day (July 24), Atlanta Public Schools reached an agreement with PBS to convert WPBA into a full-service member outlet in order to better compete with GPB for viewers, public and private monetary contributions, and corporate programming underwriters. The move, which allows WPBA to carry any content supplied by the service and to provide PBS Passport to its members, resulted in a roughly $500,000 increase in programming expenditures; however, the station announced that it would not simulcast programming with GPB and would inform the statewide network of its scheduling decisions. In addition, it was announced that the station planned to keep its Monday and Friday lineups—which primarily relied on British programming—unchanged and expand local program production.

On January 18, 2022, Public Broadcasting Atlanta rebranded both WPBA and its sister station WABE, along with their websites, podcasts and smartphone apps, as a single unified entity named WABE, with a new logo and slogan, &quot;Amplifying Atlanta&quot;. The call sign of the television station changed to WABE-TV on that date.

==Funding==
In fiscal year 2021, WPBA generated $5.13 million in total revenue. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provided $925,000, primarily in the form of a Community Service Grant. $1.8 million in revenue was generated from memberships and subscriptions from a total of 9,770 contributors.

==Local programming==
WABE-TV&#x27;s local programming, fitting the station&#x27;s remit, traditionally focuses on Atlanta issues and culture, though in recent years it has been more limited while WABE built out a digital presence and a series of podcasts. The weekly talk show &quot;Love and Respect with Killer Mike&quot; airs on television and expanded to radio in 2022; that same year, the station began a concert series franchise, &quot;Sounds Like ATL&quot;.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
NHK World-Japan was added as a subchannel in 2018.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WPBA began transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 21 on January 1, 2005. WPBA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 30, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 21, virtual channel 30.

<text>The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (), informally referred to as Spa, is a motor-racing circuit located in Francorchamps, Stavelot, Wallonia, Belgium, about southeast of Spa. It is the current venue of the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix, hosting its first Grand Prix in 1925, and has held a Grand Prix every year since 1985 except 2003 and 2006.

Spa also hosts several other international events including the 24 Hours of Spa and the World Endurance Championship 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. It is also the host of the Uniroyal Fun Cup 25 Hours of Spa, one of the longest motor races in the world.

The circuit has undergone several redesigns through its history, most extensively in 1979 when the track was modified and shortened from a circuit using public roads to a permanent circuit due to safety concerns with the old circuit.

==Track configurations==

===Original layout===

In 1918, German headquarters were in Spa, and in 1919, the Treaty of Versailles separated the Eupen-Malmedy region from Prussia and the German Empire. Between January and June 1920, a plebiscite was held, without a secret ballot and under other questionable circumstances. As a result, the Transitional Government prepared for the unification of Eupen-Malmedy with Belgium in June 1925. 

Jules de Thier, owner of the Liège newspaper &quot;La Meuse&quot;, was looking for a site to host a race, and following a meeting at the Hotel des Bruyères in Francorchamps, with burgomaster Joseph de Crawhez and racing-car driver Henri Langlois van Ophem, it was decided that the roads from Spa-Francorchamps to the former German Malmedy, to Stavelot, and back towards Francorchamps constituted an ideal triangle-shaped circuit with few tight corners and long fast sections. Eau Rouge creek was the Belgian-German Empire border until 1920, with the &quot;Ancienne Douane&quot; customs office being rather recent than ancient. After passing through former German Bürnenville, the track crossed the former border again halfway on the road between Malmedy and Stavelot, at the junction of the Meiz road. In Stavelot, there was a sharp right-hander, later replaced with a sweeping bypass. 

The track&#x27;s inaugural race was planned for August 1921, but was cancelled when only one driver entered. The first car race was held at the circuit in 1922, and 1924 saw the first running of the now famous 24 Hours of Francorchamps race. The circuit was first used for Grand Prix racing in 1925.

The original Spa-Francorchamps circuit was essentially a speed course, with drivers managing higher average speeds than on other road race tracks. At the time, the Belgians took pride in having a very fast circuit, and to improve average speeds, in 1939 the former Ancienne Douane slow uphill U-turn after the bottom of the Eau Rouge creek valley was cut short with a faster sweep straight up the hill, called the Raidillon. In public traffic until 2000, at Eau Rouge, southbound traffic was allowed to use the famous uphill corner, while the opposite downhill traffic had to use the old road and U-turn behind the grandstands, rejoining the race track at the bottom of Eau Rouge. Around 2001, a new bypass road N62c was built to the East, and the track was closed to the public as the road from Stavelot to Blanchimont became a cul-de-sac.

The old race track continued through the dynamic Kemmel curves (straightened in 1979) to the highest part of the track ( above the lowest part), then went downhill into Les Combes, a fast, slightly banked downhill left-hand corner towards Burnenville, passing this village in a fast right hand sweep. Near Malmedy, the Masta straight began, which was only interrupted by the Masta Kink between farm houses before arriving at the town of Stavelot. Then, the track progressed through an uphill straight section with a few bends called La Carriere, going through two high-speed turns (the former being an unnamed right-hand turn, and the latter named Blanchimont) before braking very hard, for the Bus Stop chicane that was added later, and for La Source hairpin, that rejoined the downhill start finish section (as opposed to today where the start–finish section is before La Source).
Spa is located in the Belgian Ardennes countryside, and the long old circuit was, and for most parts still is, used as an everyday public road, and there were houses, trees, electric poles, fields and other obstacles located right next to the track. Before 1970, there were no safety modifications of any kind done to the circuit and the conditions of the circuit were, aside from a few straw bales, virtually identical to everyday civilian use. Former Formula One racing driver and team owner Jackie Oliver was quoted as saying &quot;if you went off the road, you didn&#x27;t know what you were going to hit&quot;.

Spa-Francorchamps was the fastest road circuit in Europe at the time, and it had a reputation for being dangerous and very fast – it demanded calmness from drivers, and most were frightened of it. The old Spa circuit was unique in that speeds were consistently high with hardly any let-up at all for three to four minutes. This made it an extraordinarily difficult mental challenge, because most of the corners were taken at more than and were not quite flat – every corner was as important as the one before it. If a driver lifted the throttle more than expected, then whole seconds, not tenths, would be lost. The slightest error of any kind carried multiple harsh consequences, but this also worked inversely: huge advantages could be gained if a driver came out of a corner slightly faster.

Like the Le Mans circuit, which also ran on public roads, Spa became notorious for fatal accidents. At the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix, two drivers, Chris Bristow and Alan Stacey, were killed within 15 minutes (although Stacey&#x27;s accident was caused by a bird hitting him in the face) and Stirling Moss had crashed at Burnenville during practice and was severely injured. When Armco crash barriers were added to the track in 1970, deaths became less frequent, but the track was still notorious for other factors. The Ardennes forest had very unpredictable weather and there were parts where it was raining and the track was wet, and other parts where the sun was shining and the track was completely dry. This factor was a commonality on long circuits, but the unpredictable weather at Spa, combined with the fact that it was a track with all but one corner being high-speed, made it one of the most dangerous race tracks in the world (if not the most). As a result, the Formula 1 and motorcycle Grands Prix and 1000 km sportscar races saw smaller than usual fields at Spa because most drivers and riders feared the circuit and did not like racing there. Multiple fatalities during the 1973 and 1975 24 Hours of Spa touring car races more or less sealed the old circuit&#x27;s fate, and by 1978, the last year Spa was in its original form, the only major races held there were the Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix and the Spa 24 Hours touring car race; the 1000 km World Sportscar Championship race no longer took place after 1975 and did not come back until 1982. 

In 1969, the Belgian Grand Prix was boycotted by the F1 drivers because of the extreme danger of Spa. There had been ten car racing fatalities in total at the track in the 1960s, including five in the two years previous. The drivers demanded changes made to Spa which were not possible on short notice, so the Belgian Grand Prix was dropped that year. Armco barriers were added to the track and sections of it were improved (especially the Stavelot and Hollowell sections), just like they had been added for the 1969 Le Mans race. One last race there the following year on the improved track was still not satisfactory enough (even after a temporary chicane was added at Malmedy just for that race) for the drivers in terms of safety, and even with the chicane, the drivers averaged over during the race. For the 1971 race, the track owners and authorities had not brought the track up to date with mandatory safety measures, and the race was cancelled. Formula One would not return to Spa until 1983 on the modern track.

====Masta Kink====

The Masta Kink &quot;was by far the most difficult corner in the world&quot;, according to Jackie Stewart, requiring skill and bravery in equal measure to get it right. After a long run from Malmedy, the cars would reach top speed before having to negotiate Masta, a high speed left-right chicane, and a good exit speed was vital as it was followed by another long straight run to Stavelot. This was a very fast and very dangerous corner, as it was situated right in the middle of two long unbroken straights, both about long. The speed in this sector could reach .

Masta was removed from F1 racing after the 1970 season. Jackie Stewart&#x27;s crusade to improve safety in racing was set in motion by his crash there in 1966, when his BRM ended upside-down in a ditch near a farmhouse on the outside of the corner, with fuel gushing out of the tank onto Stewart, who had broken ribs. At this point, many of the Formula One drivers disliked Spa (including Stewart and Jim Clark, who had some of his greatest wins there) because of the immense speeds that were constant on the track. While he was spectating at the 1972 12 Hours of Sebring, Stewart attempted to organise a boycott of the Spa 1000 km race that year, a move that was not respected by many of the drivers, because Spa was still popular with racing drivers outside of Formula One. Stewart later described the old Spa circuit in 1986 as being as &quot;ferocious as a tiger&quot;, and he later described Masta in an interview in 2011 as perhaps the hardest corner on any racetrack he raced on in his career; even more so than Eau Rouge.
Another particularly gruesome story comes from the 1972 24-hour touring car race. During one of his pit stops at night, Hans-Joachim Stuck shouted to his co-driver Jochen Mass over the noise from the cars that he should &quot;look out for body parts at the Masta Kink&quot;. Mass arrived there expecting to see pieces from cars all over the road but was appalled to discover it was in fact the remains of a marshal.

After Masta, and at the end of the subsequent Hollowell Straight, there used to be a sharp hairpin at the entrance to the town itself, which was later bypassed by a quicker, banked right hand corner. Another fast section of road in the forest leads to Blanchimont. Here, the new short Grand Prix track of 1979 joins the old layout.

Eighteen Formula One World Championship Grands Prix were run on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit&#x27;s original configuration, which was boycotted by F1 in 1969, before the revised circuit banished it to the history books in 1979. The lap record of the old triangle-shaped track is 3 minutes and 13.4 seconds, held by the French driver Henri Pescarolo, driving a Matra at the 1973 Spa 1000 km World Sportscar Championship race at an average speed of , but the fastest ever recorded time of the old Spa circuit was the pole position time for the same race—3 minutes and 12.7 seconds by Jacky Ickx in a Ferrari 312PB.

===New layout===

Over the years, the Spa course has been modified several times. The track was originally long, but after World War II, the track underwent some changes. In 1930, the chicane at Malmedy was eliminated and bypassed, making the course even faster, but the chicane was re-installed in 1935, albeit slightly different. In 1939, &quot;Virage de l&#x27;Ancienne Douane&quot; was eliminated and cut short, thus giving birth to the Eau Rouge/Raidillon uphill sweeping corner. In 1947, the chicane at Malmedy was again eliminated and bypassed, and was made part of the Masta Straight. The slight right-hander that was originally Hollowell (the corner before Stavelot after the second Masta Straight) was eliminated. And finally, instead of going through a slight left-hander that went into the town of Stavelot and a sharp right-hander at a road junction in Stavelot, a shortcut was built that became a very fast, very wide right-handed turn that bypassed Stavelot. All these changes made the final configuration of the old Spa circuit long, and also made Spa the fastest open road circuit in the world. In the final years of the old circuit, drivers could average . The biggest change, however, saw the circuit being shortened from in 1979. The start/finish line, which was originally on the downhill straight before Eau Rouge, was moved to the straight before the La Source hairpin in 1981. Like its predecessor, the new layout is still a fast and hilly route through the Ardennes where speeds in excess of can be reached. Since its inception, the place has been famous for its unpredictable weather, where drivers are confronted with one part of the course being clear and bright while another stretch is rainy and slippery.


====Eau Rouge and Raidillon====

The most famous part of the circuit is the Eau Rouge and Raidillon combination. Having negotiated the La Source hairpin, drivers race down a straight to the point where the track crosses the Eau Rouge stream for the first time, before being launched steeply uphill into a sweeping left-right-left series of corners with a blind summit. Properly speaking, the Eau Rouge corner is only the left-hander at the bottom. The following right-hander that leads steeply uphill, which was introduced in 1939 to shortcut the original Ancienne Douane hairpin, is called . The corner requires an amount of skill from the driver to negotiate it well and the long Kemmel straight ahead produces good overtaking opportunities for drivers at the following &quot;Les Combes&quot; corner. The corner was tighter and narrower before 1970, allowing drivers to take the corner faster.

Double F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso explained:

A challenge for drivers has always been to take Eau Rouge/Raidillon flat out. Touring cars can take the corner at , and Formula One cars at over due to high downforce. World Champion Jacques Villeneuve once spoke of the effects of downforce, saying that to get through the corner the drivers have to drive faster, because downforce increases the faster a race car goes. Without lifting the throttle through Eau Rouge, a car would be flat out from La Source, along the Kemmel straight to Les Combes, a total distance of .

A loss of control through this section can often lead to a very heavy shunt, as usually the rear end of the car is lost and the resulting impact is often lateral. Several famous racing drivers have crashed while driving through Eau Rouge/Raidillon, including Stefan Bellof in a Porsche sportscar, Guy Renard during the 1990 24h of Spa-Francorchamps in a Toyota Corolla GT, and Alex Zanardi in a season-ending crash during a practice session of the 1993 Belgian Grand Prix in a Lotus. Jacques Villeneuve suffered a spectacular crash at the top of Raidillon in qualifying during the 1999 Belgian Grand Prix which he described as &quot;My best-ever crash&quot;. His teammate Ricardo Zonta followed Villeneuve by having a similar accident later in practice, leading cartoonist Jim Bamber to show BAR boss Craig Pollock telling Zonta: &quot;Jacques is the quickest through Eau Rouge, so go out there and do exactly what Jacques does…&quot; It was revealed later that Villeneuve and Zonta had a personal bet to see if either could take the corner flat out.

Following the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at Imola in 1994, the following F1 races saw the introduction of chicanes made up from stacked tyres. The entry to Eau Rouge was obstructed in such a way in 1994, although it was returned to its previous configuration the following year. The corner was slightly modified for the 2002 Belgian Grand Prix.

When fans first got to see the course configuration at the start of the weekend of the 2005 Turkish Grand Prix, they noted that an uphill kink on the back straight was very similar to Eau Rouge; the kink was therefore jokingly dubbed &quot;Faux Rouge&quot; (a pun on the name of the original Spa corner using the French word &quot;faux&quot;, meaning &quot;false&quot;).

====Blanchimont====

The Blanchimont high-speed left-hand turn, present in both the old circuit and the new, shorter, track, is the final sweeping corner of the track before the chicane, which leads to the pit straight.

This turn and the approach to it have been the scene of serious accidents over time, the most recent being in 2001, when Luciano Burti lost the front wing of his Prost due to a clash with Eddie Irvine&#x27;s Jaguar, losing front downforce and steering, leaving the track at and piling into the tyre wall, the impact knocking him out and burying the car into a mound of tyres. Problems have also occurred in lower classes of racing with Tom Kristensen having a very violent crash in a Formula 3000 car in 1997 after running wide on the entry to the Blanchimont turn and subsequently hitting the wall, throwing the monocoque back out in the middle of the track, where it was hit by numerous cars before coming to a complete halt.

The run-off area is narrower than in other turns taken at this speed, and behind the protective barriers there is a 7–8 metre drop. This is the first turn taken by the cars after the new track rejoins the route of the old track. Blanchimont was also the scene where in 1992 after Érik Comas had crashed heavily during Friday&#x27;s session, Ayrton Senna stopped, disembarked his car and sprinted to help the injured driver, with other cars driving past at racing speeds.

====Jacky Ickx corner====
From the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix turn 11 has been called the Jacky Ickx corner as a tribute to his career. The corner was formerly known by most drivers as either &quot;Speakers corner&quot; because the circuit&#x27;s public address announcer could see the cars for the first time after the cars disappeared into the forest past Raidillon or simply &quot;The Corner with No Name&quot;. There are two versions of Jacky Ickx as of 2022, the car turn and a turn inside of it for motorcycles.

==Problems and renovations==
Due to the introduction of the Television Without Frontiers Directive (1989), tobacco advertising and sponsorship on television were banned within the European Union from 1991. Formula One faced a major threat regarding races in its historical European heartland. Due to these political and legislative circumstances, the Grand Prix at Spa was left out of the 2003 calendar as a response to the internal tobacco legislation in Belgium. The event was tagged as a world class event within the national senate, and thus it was saved for the 2004 Formula One season. The final Bus Stop chicane was reprofiled for 2004 with an additional sweep to the right.

Spa was dropped from the Formula One calendar in . The organiser of the event went bankrupt in late 2005, and therefore the planned improvements to the race track and paddock had not yet been made. The Wallonia government stepped in and provided the necessary funds, but too late for the 2006 race to take place.

===Redevelopment for the 2007 season===
With a new financial backer, the renovation started on 6 November 2006 and finished in May 2007, costing around €19 million. Formula 1 returned to Spa for , with a modified track layout. The Bus Stop chicane was moved back towards Blanchimont and the La Source hairpin moved forward. This allowed more space for the new pit lane, and gave a longer start/finish straight.

===Modifications===
New asphalt runoff was added to the inside and outside of Les Combes for the 2010 race, in line with the prevailing trends at other Formula One circuits. Prior to the 2013 race, drainage grooves were cut into the asphalt on the start–finish straight, underneath the first 11 grid slots. Drivers were initially concerned that this would affect grip at the start.

=== Eau Rouge and Raidillon safety concerns ===

In Spa Francorchamps&#x27; tenure as a permanent racing facility, after it was removed from the public road network in 2000, there have been multiple accidents in the Eau Rouge/Raidillon combination. In the day and age where safety is paramount to many racing organizations and governing bodies like the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile, these crashes, of which some noteworthy ones are listed below, opened up public debate whether the Eau Rouge/Raidillon combination was deemed unsafe. Criticism centred around the nature of the tyre barrier and run-off area of Raidillon, which tended to bounce out-of-control cars back onto the track rather than collect them.

In October 2020 the circuit announced that gravel traps would be placed at La Source, Raidillon, Blanchimont, Les Combes and Stavelot. The runoff areas of some corners including Raidillon would be expanded. It was part of an €80 million upgrade to the circuit that would make it able to hold motorcycle races. The upgrade will also include a grandstand at the top of the Eau Rouge/Raidillon hill. The upgrades were completed in March 2022, ready for the FIM Endurance World Championship race, due to be held in June. The circuit is also shortened to , as Jacky Ickx corner is bypassed in favour of a shorter section with more runoff for motorcycles.

==== Fatal crash of Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert in 2019 ====
During the Formula 2 feature race in late August, a serious incident between Anthoine Hubert and Juan Manuel Correa occurred shortly after Raidillon on the Kemmel Straight. As the second lap began, Trident driver Giuliano Alesi lost control of his car as he climbed the Raidillon curve due to a puncture he had received earlier, causing his car to spin and hit the left wall of the circuit, tearing off his rear wing and spreading debris onto the track. As another Trident driver, Ralph Boschung reached the crest of Raidillon, he slowed down and moved towards the run-off area to avoid Alesi&#x27;s damaged car and the field of debris. Hubert, who was following Boschung closely and had no view of what had happened to Alesi, moved right to avoid Boschung&#x27;s slowing car, clipping Boschung&#x27;s right rear wheel with his front wing. Hubert&#x27;s car crashed into the tyre barrier on the right side of the track at an acute angle and was deflected sideways into the path of Charouz driver Juan Manuel Correa, who struck it on the left side in the driver seat area.

The incident resulted in the death of Hubert and serious injury to Correa with the feature race being abandoned and the scheduled sprint race a day later being cancelled too, whilst the Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix went ahead.

==== 2021 W Series and Formula One incidents ====
During the qualifying session of the W Series, rain started to fall, affecting the grip. This caused a serious incident that involved six cars crashing into each other. Sarah Moore was the first driver to lose control of her car, spinning into the barrier at Raidillon. Abbie Eaton also lost the car and spun into the same barrier. She bounced back into Moore at low speed. Beitske Visser lost the rear end, spun around and went straight into Eaton and Moore, causing Eaton to become airborne. Ayla Ågren did the same as Visser, spinning and running into Moore and an airborne Eaton. Belén García then hit all four cars, causing Visser to become airborne and mount the tyre barrier. The final car of Fabienne Wohlwend then hit Beitske Visser head on, causing Visser to spin into the track and roll over. The incident ended with cars all over the track and run off areas. All drivers were checked as a precaution, and Visser and Agren were sent to hospital for x-rays and further checks. Eventually, all drivers were cleared and unharmed.

Just one day after the W Series crash, Formula One held its qualifying session in heavy rain. In the third segment of qualifying, many drivers were complaining that the conditions were not safe and that the session should be delayed or red flagged. Lando Norris then had a snap of oversteer, and subsequently corrected but then aquaplaned into the tyre barrier at Raidillon. His McLaren then spun into the track while crossing the racing line. Norris was taken to hospital for x-rays, but was cleared to race the next day.

After this crash and the W Series incident just a day before, drivers from all series were calling for changes to that section of the track. Jack Aitken, who a month earlier suffered a broken collarbone and fractured vertebra after a crash at Raidillon in the 2021 24 Hours of Spa, said &quot;everyone has gotten the picture of what needs changing&quot; on social media, regarding the W Series crash. Zhou Guanyu stated &quot;Eau Rouge corner in Spa needs to making a change,&quot; while Pietro Fittipaldi said &quot;they need to do something to Eau Rouge to make it safer.&quot; Carlos Sainz Jr. insisted the &quot;corner maybe needs a bit of fine-tuning still.&quot; Sacha Fenestraz, Jake Hughes, Daniel Ricciardo and Toto Wolff all agreed changes need to be made immediately to make the circuit safer.

==== Fatal FRECA crash of Dilano van &#x27;t Hoff ====
On 1 July 2023, a multi-car crash in the second race of the 2023 Formula Regional European Championship resulted in the death of Dutch racing driver Dilano van &#x27;t Hoff. The crash happened at the exit of the Raidillon corner, at the beginning of the Kemmel straight. Dilano lost control of his MP motorsport car at the exit of the Raidillon corner, hitting the barrier on the left side of the track. The car was bounced back in the middle of the track, after which Adam Fitzgerald hit the cockpit of the car on drivers right side at full speed. Poor visibility due to heavy rain prevented the Irish racing driver from reacting in time to avoid the collision. Other drivers involved in the crash were Joshua Dufek, Emerson Fittipaldi Jr., and Enzo Scionti.

==== Other incidents ====
Multiple other incidents have happened at the Eau Rouge/Raidillon section of the circuit. These include crashes for Kevin Magnussen in 2016, where he managed to walk away with only minor injuries; Pietro Fittipaldi in 2018, where he broke his leg and Jack Aitken in 2021, where he broke his collarbone. In May 2023, during the Franco Fun Festival, the driver Olivier Parigi, who was driving the car #508, crashed and died. According to a statement of the organizers &quot;Excessive speed and then a loss of control on his own in the Speaker Corner. Minor accident but a chain of circumstances after breaking away in the car were fatal to our friend during his stay in Liège hospital.&quot; 

===Redevelopment for the 2022 season===
Ahead of the 2022 FIM EWC 24H Spa EWC Motos race and 2022 F1 Grand Prix, the circuit underwent a major facility and safety facility redevelopment which had been planned since . Extra run-off was added to the Eau Rouge/Raidillon part of the course – changes made in response to several big accidents in recent years at that section of the track, including the fatal accident of Anthoine Hubert during the 2019 Spa-Francorchamps Formula 2 round. In addition, gravel traps were added to and modified at various corners around the circuit including: La Source, Les Combes, Speaker&#x27;s Corner, Pouhon (or double gauche), Stavelot and Blanchimont. The track has also been resurfaced for this year&#x27;s event altering track grip levels, with Max Verstappen the first driver to run a Formula One car around the renovated circuit in a Red Bull RB7. , head of Dromo Circuit Design, the company who carried out the renovations, revealed twenty possible different iterations of Eau Rouge were evaluated, with the selected iteration chosen with the help of form of ex-Formula One drivers Thierry Boutsen and Emanuele Pirro and fine tuned with simulations for Formula One and GT cars.

Spa-Francorchamps is part of the 2023 Formula 1 calendar, and its contract was extended to 2025 in October 2023.

==Layout history==

==Lap records==

The unofficial all-time track record set during a race weekend is 1:41.252, set by Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance, during final qualifying for the 2020 Belgian Grand Prix. The official lap record for the current circuit layout is 1:44.701, set by Sergio Pérez in a Red Bull Racing RB20 during the 2024 Belgian Grand Prix. As of August 2024, the fastest official race lap records of the modern Spa-Francorchamps circuit for several top series have been listed as:

==In popular culture==
As the long-time home of the Belgian Grand Prix and its location within the Ardennes forests it has been a popular backdrop for all kinds of fictional media, from appearances in comics and motion pictures, to regular appearances in dozens of video games going back into the 1980s.

==Tour de France==
The circuit has been used several times in the Tour de France cycling race. In 1980, the circuit was part of an individual time trial stage, won by Bernard Hinault (); while in 1989, several laps of the circuit were completed before the finish of the third stage, which was won by &#x27;s Raúl Alcalá. In 2017, the circuit was used as part of the third stage, starting in Verviers, Belgium and ending in Longwy, France.

==Climate==
The area of Spa-Francorchamps is often rainy or having cool air temperatures, which has led to Formula One events such as the 1998 14-car pileup on a waterlogged track and the dramatic finish to the 2008 event, when rain fell during the last few laps after an all-dry race. The Royal Meteorological Institute runs weather stations both in Stavelot and in Malmedy, which both show similar oceanic climates with some interior influence. Although temperatures generally often stay above freezing in winter, snowfall is quite common. During summer, temperatures most often remain in the low 20s, with frequent cloud cover and showers. With the World Endurance race running in spring and the Formula One race in late summer, hot temperatures during high-profile events are very rare. Even so, the annual warmest temperature averages above . The official Spa weather station is located at a similar elevation as the race track a few miles north and yields similar conditions to the Stavelot and Malmedy stations. Summer may nights may get rather chilly, but stay above frost during the prime season for the circuit.
