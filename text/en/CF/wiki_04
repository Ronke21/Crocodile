<text>&quot;The Judgment&quot; (German: &quot;Das Urteil&quot;), also translated &quot;The Verdict&quot;, is a short story written by Franz Kafka in 1912, concerning the relationship between a man and his father.

== Plot summary ==

The story begins with a young merchant, Georg Bendemann, sitting in his room writing a letter to his dear friend in Russia, who had left their hometown some years previously to set up a business that, though initially successful, is now failing. Georg is writing to tell his friend, amongst other things, that he is engaged to marry Frieda Brandenfeld, a girl from a well-to-do family.

Georg breaks out of his reverie and decides to check on his father. Though quite ill, Georg&#x27;s father appears huge. Georg informs his father that he has just written a letter to his friend, updating him on his upcoming marriage. His father questions the existence of the friend in Russia, at which point Georg changes the subject. Georg&#x27;s father accuses him of deceiving him about the happenings of the business. He claims the death of his wife (Georg&#x27;s mother) hit him harder than it did Georg.

Georg insists on having his father lie down in bed for a while. Because of this, Georg&#x27;s father claims his son wants him dead. Moreover, he admits to knowing his son&#x27;s friend, and, in fact, to having been carrying on a correspondence with him concurrently with Georg&#x27;s. He claims to have swayed the friend&#x27;s loyalty from Georg to himself, and that the friend reads the father&#x27;s letters, and disposes of Georg&#x27;s without reading them. He makes Georg feel terrible, suggesting that Georg has ignored his friend ever since he moved away to Russia. The father does not appreciate Georg&#x27;s love and care, maintaining he can take care of himself. Georg shrinks back into a corner, scared of his father and his harsh words.

Georg&#x27;s father accuses him of being selfish and finally sentences him to &quot;death by drowning&quot;. Georg feels himself pushed from the room. He runs from his home to a bridge over a stretch of water. He swings himself over the railing and plunges, apparently to his death.

== Context ==

Franz Kafka wrote &quot;The Judgment&quot; (&quot;Das Urteil&quot;) at the age of 29. At this point in his life, Kafka had finished his studies of law at the Karl-Ferdinands-Universität of Prague five years earlier and had worked at various jobs, including working for an insurance company and starting an asbestos factory with his brother-in-law, Karl Hermann.

Kafka wrote &quot;The Judgment&quot; in a single sitting on September 22, 1912. In later writings, he described the creative outburst of &quot;The Judgment&quot; as “the total opening of body and soul,” saying that “the story evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime.” Kafka viewed the work as “one of his most successful and perfect literary creations” which he was able to write in a “semi-unconscious state of mind.” Kafka was incredibly enthusiastic after the work, and talked to his good friend, Max Brod, who edited and published much of his work. &quot;The Judgment&quot; was published in 1913 in the literary yearbook &quot;Arkadia&quot;. The story was dedicated &quot;to Miss Felice Bauer&quot; whom he met just before writing it, and in subsequent editions simply &quot;for F.&quot;. Brod noted in his biography that the name of the main character, Georg Bendemann, alludes to Kafka (Franz has as many letters as Georg; Bende sounds similar to Kafka) and the name of the fiancée alludes to Felice (they have the same initials; Frieda as many letters as Felice; &quot;Branden&quot; may refer to Brandenburg around Berlin where Felice lived; &quot;feld&quot; (field) is related to &quot;Bauer&quot; (farmer)).

The work has several key inspirations that can be traced to events around the time it was created. While Kafka was running his business, he was troubled because the time required for this job limited his literary creativity. This conflict inspired the character Georg Bendemann, the protagonist of &quot;The Judgment&quot;.

== Interpretation ==

Interpretations of Kafka&#x27;s short story range from simple parallelism between the lives of Georg and Kafka to more complex views concerning the notion of judgement itself. Heinz Politzer, for example, views the story as a means through which Kafka explored his thoughts about his romance with Felice Bauer, citing as evidence the impending marriages Georg and Kafka held in common. He argues that the severed relationship between Georg and his friend represented the bachelorhood that Georg, and therefore Kafka, would soon have to give up.

Herbert Tauber, on the other hand, viewed the story as a commentary on the conflict between two separate worlds, shown through the conflict between father and son. The world of the son is a world of “vital existence in which probability and reservation rule” and that of the father is a world “in which every step has an incalculable importance because it is taken under the horizon of an absolute summons to the road”.

Meanwhile, Russel Berman sees the story as a discourse on the nature of judgment in general, recognizing its depiction in the story as weak and illogical, yet simultaneously necessary. He also bemoans such a state of society as was suggested in the story that would foster degraded forms of writing and, more hauntingly, nurture extreme willingness to conform to orders without concern for consequences. Berman additionally points out that Georg&#x27;s need to rationalize why he does not want to invite his estranged friend to his wedding is a result of concerns he has pushed out of sight, but nevertheless still holds. He says Kafka shares this methodology of exploring the human psyche by analyzing the motivations behind actions and thoughts with the famed thinkers Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud.

In the story, the exiled friend in Russia exerts considerable power over the other characters—Georg, his father, and his fiancée, Frieda. In his diaries, Kafka wrote that the friend is the strongest connection between Georg and his father, for it is through this link that his father is able to reassert himself as paterfamilias and his son&#x27;s enemy and that Georg is able to submissively accept him as such. Kafka goes on to relate that the fiancée exists, in a tangential sense, only because of the father-son bond that the absent exile creates.

== Translation ==

A virtually insurmountable problem facing the translator is how to deal with the author&#x27;s intentional use of ambiguous terms or of words that have several meanings. An example is Kafka&#x27;s use of the German noun &quot;Verkehr&quot; in the final sentence of the story. &#x27;Verkehr&#x27; can mean either &quot;traffic&quot; or &quot;intercourse&quot; in both the social or sexual sense. The sentence can be translated as: &quot;At this moment an unending stream of traffic was just going over the bridge.&quot; What gives added weight to the obvious double meaning of &quot;Verkehr&quot; is Kafka&#x27;s confession to his friend and biographer Max Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of &quot;a violent ejaculation.&quot;

<doc id="937967" wikidata="Q506680" url="?curid=937967" title="Endemic (epidemiology)">
<text>In epidemiology, an infection is said to be endemic in a specific population or populated place when that infection is constantly present, or maintained at a baseline level, without extra infections being brought into the group as a result of travel or similar means. The term describes the distribution of an infectious disease among a group of people or within a populated area. An endemic disease always has a steady, predictable number of people getting sick, but that number can be high (&quot;hyperendemic&quot;) or low (&quot;hypoendemic&quot;), and the disease can be severe or mild. Also, a disease that is usually endemic can become epidemic.

For example, chickenpox is endemic in the United Kingdom, but malaria is not. Every year, there are a few cases of malaria reported in the UK, but these do not lead to sustained transmission in the population due to the lack of a suitable vector (mosquitoes of the genus &quot;Anopheles&quot;). Consequently, the number of people infected by malaria in the UK is too variable to be called endemic. However, the number of people who get chickenpox in the UK varies little from year to year, so chickenpox is considered endemic in the UK.

== Mathematical determination ==

For an infection that relies on person-to-person transmission, to be endemic, each person who becomes infected with the disease must pass it on to one other person on average. Assuming a completely susceptible population, that means that the basic reproduction number (R0) of the infection must equal one. In a population with some immune individuals, the basic reproduction number multiplied by the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population (&quot;S&quot;) must be one. This takes account of the probability of each individual to whom the disease may be transmitted being susceptible to it, effectively discounting the immune sector of the population. So, for a disease to be in an &quot;endemic steady state&quot; or &quot;endemic equilibrium&quot;, it holds that

: formula_1

In this way, the infection neither dies out, nor does the number of infected people increase exponentially. An infection that starts as an epidemic will eventually either die out (with the possibility of it resurging in a theoretically predictable cyclical manner) or reach the endemic steady state, depending on a number of factors, including the virulence of the disease and its mode of transmission.

If a disease is in an endemic steady state in a population, the relation above allows the basic reproduction number (R0) of a particular infection to be estimated. This in turn can be fed into a mathematical model for the epidemic. Based on the reproduction number, we can define the epidemic waves, such as the first wave, second wave, etc. for COVID-19 in different regions and countries.

== Misuse ==
It has been claimed that endemic COVID-19 implies that the disease severity would be mild. However, endemicity has no inherent relationship with disease severity. Endemic COVID-19 could be mild if previously acquired immunity reduces the risk of death and disability during future infections, but in itself endemicity only means that there will be a steady, predictable number of sick people.

== Related terms ==

=== Categories of endemic diseases ===
;Holoendemic: An endemic disease with an extremely high rate of infection, especially a disease that infects nearly everyone early in life, so that nearly all adults have developed some level of immunity.
;Hyperendemic: An endemic disease with a high rate of infection, especially one affecting people of all ages equally.
;Mesoendemic: An endemic disease with a moderate rate of infection. This term is often used to describe the prevalence of malaria in a local area, with 10 to 50% of children showing evidence of prior infection being considered a moderate level for that disease.
;Hypoendemic: An endemic disease with a low rate of infection. Typhoid fever is a hypoendemic disease in the US.

=== Categories for non-endemic diseases ===
;Sporadic: A disease that appears occasionally, but, unlike endemic disease, is not always present at a steady and predictable level.
;Outbreak: An epidemic, especially one affecting a very small area, such as the people in one town or attending a single event. The 2019–2020 measles outbreaks showed a normally endemic disease causing an epidemic outbreak, primarily among unvaccinated people.
;Epidemic: A new disease that is spreading or a previously endemic disease whose infection rate is increasing significantly. Seasonal flu frequently appears as an epidemic.
;Pandemic: An epidemic affecting a very large part of the world, generally multiple countries or multiple continents. Seasonal flu is sometimes a global pandemic.

== Examples ==
This is a short, incomplete list of some infections that are usually considered endemic:
* Common cold
* Lassa fever
* Malaria
* Polio
* Rotavirus
* Hepatitis C
* Measles

Smallpox was an endemic disease until it was eradicated through vaccination.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;endemic&quot; comes from the Greek: , , &quot;in, within&quot; and , , &quot;people&quot;.

== See also ==
* Syndemic – when two or more public health problems coincide and exacerbate each other
* Eradication of infectious diseases – when an infection declines until it no longer exists

<doc id="937969" wikidata="Q749834" url="?curid=937969" title="Scythian languages">
<text>The Scythian languages ( or or ) are a group of Eastern Iranic languages of the classical and late antique period (the Middle Iranic period), spoken in a vast region of Eurasia by the populations belonging to the Scythian cultures and their descendants. The dominant ethnic groups among the Scythian-speakers were nomadic pastoralists of Central Asia and the Pontic–Caspian steppe. Fragments of their speech known from inscriptions and words quoted in ancient authors as well as analysis of their names indicate that it was an Indo-European language, more specifically from the Iranic group of Indo-Iranic languages.

Most of the Scythian languages eventually became extinct, except for modern Ossetian (which descends from the Alanic dialect of Scytho-Sarmatian), Wakhi (which descends from the Khotanese and Tumshuqese forms of Scytho-Khotanese), and Yaghnobi (which descends from Sogdian). Alexander Lubotsky summarizes the known linguistic landscape as follows:
== Classification ==
Ossetian is an Eastern Iranic language. The vast majority of Scythological scholars agree in considering the Scythian languages a part of the Eastern Iranic languages too. This relies principally on the fact that the Greek inscriptions of the Northern Black Sea Coast contain several hundreds of Sarmatian names showing a close affinity to the Ossetian language.

Some scholars detect a division of Scythian into two dialects: a western, more conservative dialect, and an eastern, more innovative one. The Scythian languages may have formed a dialect continuum:
* Alanic languages or Scytho-Sarmatian in the west: were spoken by people originally of Iranic stock from the 8th and 7th century BC onwards in the area of Ukraine, Southern Russia and Kazakhstan.
**Modern Ossetian survives as a continuation of the language family &quot;possibly&quot; represented by Scytho-Sarmatian inscriptions, although the Scytho-Sarmatian language family &quot;does not simply represent the same [Ossetian] language&quot; at an earlier date.

* Saka languages or Scytho-Khotanese in the east: spoken in the first century in the Kingdom of Khotan (located in present-day Xinjiang, China), and including the Khotanese of Khotan and Tumshuqese of Tumshuq.

It is highly probable that already in the Old Iranic period, there were some eastern Scythian dialects which gave rise to the ancestor(s) of the Sogdian and Yaghnobi languages, although data required to test this hypothesis is presently lacking.

The Scythian languages shared some features with other Eastern Iranic languages, such as the use of the suffix to denote the plural form, which is also present in Sogdian, Chorasmian, Ossetian, and Yaghnobi.

==Phonology==
The Pontic Scythian language possessed the following phonemes:

&quot;This article uses cursive theta to denote the Scythian voiceless dental fricative (IPA //), and regular theta to denote the Greek aspirated, voiceless dental plosive (IPA //).&quot;

The western dialects of the Scythian languages had experienced an evolution of the Proto-Iranic sound /d/ into the Proto-Scythian sound /ð/, which in the Cimmerian and Pontic dialects of Scythian became the sound /l/. Scythian shares the evolution of Proto-Iranic sound /d/ into /ð/ with all Eastern Iranic languages with the exception of Ossetian, Yaghnobi, and Ishkashimi; and the later evolution of /ð/ into /l/ is also present in several Eastern Iranic languages such as Bactrian, Pashto, Munjani, and Yidgha.

== History ==
Early Eastern Iranic peoples originated in the Yaz culture (ca. 1500–1100 BC) in Central Asia. The Scythians migrated from Central Asia toward Eastern Europe in the 8th and 7th century BC, occupying today&#x27;s Southern Russia and Ukraine and the Carpathian Basin and parts of Moldova and Dobruja. They disappeared from history after the Hunnish invasion of Europe in the 5th century AD, and Turkic (Avar, Batsange, etc.) and Slavic peoples probably assimilated most people speaking Scythian. However, in the Caucasus, the Ossetian language belonging to the Scythian linguistic continuum remains in use , while in Central Asia, some languages belonging to Eastern Iranic group are still spoken, namely Pashto, the Pamir languages and Yaghnobi.
== Corpus ==

=== Inscriptions ===

Some scholars ascribe certain inscribed objects found in the Carpathian Basin and in Central Asia to the Scythians, but the interpretation of these inscriptions remains disputed (given that nobody has definitively identified the alphabet or translated the content).

===Issyk inscription===
The Issyk inscription is not yet certainly deciphered, and is probably in a Scythian dialect, constituting one of very few autochthonous epigraphic traces of that language. János Harmatta, using the Kharoṣṭhī script, identified the language as a Khotanese Saka dialect spoken by the Kushans, tentatively translating:
=== Personal names ===

The primary sources for Scythian words remain the Scythian toponyms, tribal names, and numerous personal names in the ancient Greek texts and in the Greek inscriptions found in the Greek colonies on the Northern Black Sea Coast. These names suggest that the Sarmatian language had close similarities to modern Ossetian.

Recorded Scythian personal names include:

===Tribal names===
Recorded Scythian tribal names include:

===Place names===
Some scholars believe that many toponyms and hydronyms of the Russian and Ukrainian steppe have Scythian links. For example, Vasmer associates the name of the river Don with an assumed/reconstructed unattested Scythian word *&quot;dānu&quot; &quot;water, river&quot;, and with Avestan &quot;dānu-&quot;, Pashto &quot;dand&quot; and Ossetian &quot;don&quot;.
The river names Don, Donets, Dnieper, Danube, and Dniester, and lake Donuzlav (the deepest one in Crimea) may also belong with the same word-group.

Recorded Scythian place names include:

=== Herodotus&#x27; Scythian etymologies ===

The Greek historian Herodotus provides another source of Scythian; he reports that the Scythians called the Amazons &quot;Oiorpata&quot;, and explains the name as a compound of &quot;oior&quot;, meaning &quot;man&quot;, and &quot;pata&quot;, meaning &quot;to kill&quot; (&quot;Hist&quot;. 4,110).

* Most scholars associate &quot;oior&quot; &quot;man&quot; with Avestan &quot;vīra-&quot; &quot;man, hero&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;vīra-&quot;, Latin &quot;vir&quot; (gen. &quot;virī&quot;) &quot;man, hero, husband&quot;, PIE . Various explanations account for &quot;pata&quot; &quot;kill&quot;:
*# Persian &quot;pat-&quot; &quot;(to) kill&quot;, &quot;patxuste&quot; &quot;killed&quot;;
*# Sogdian &quot;pt-&quot; &quot;(to) kill&quot;, &quot;ptgawsty&quot; &quot;killed&quot;;
*# Ossetian &quot;fædyn&quot; &quot;cleave&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;pātayati&quot; &quot;fell&quot;, PIE &quot;fall&quot;.
*# Avestan &quot;paiti-&quot; &quot;lord&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;páti&quot;, PIE , cf. Lat. &quot;potestate&quot; (i.e. &quot;man-ruler&quot;);
*# Ossetian &quot;maryn&quot; &quot;kill&quot;, Pashto &quot;mrəl&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;mārayati&quot;, PIE &quot;die&quot; (confusion of Greek Μ and Π);
* Alternatively, one scholar suggests Iranic &quot;aiwa-&quot; &quot;one&quot; + &quot;warah-&quot; &quot;breast&quot;, the Amazons believed to have removed a breast to aid drawing a bow, according to some ancient folklorists, and as reflected in Greek folk-etymology: &quot;a-&quot; (privative) + &quot;mazos&quot;, &quot;without breast&quot;.

Elsewhere Herodotus explains the name of the mythical one-eyed tribe Arimaspoi as a compound of the Scythian words &quot;arima&quot;, meaning &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;spu&quot;, meaning &quot;eye&quot; (&quot;Hist&quot;. 4,27).

* Some scholars connect &quot;arima&quot; &quot;one&quot; with Ossetian &quot;ærmæst&quot; &quot;only&quot;, Avestic &quot;airime&quot; &quot;quiet&quot;, Greek &quot;erēmos&quot; &quot;empty&quot;, PIE ?, and &quot;spu&quot; &quot;eye&quot; with Avestic &quot;spas-&quot; &quot;foretell&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;spaś-&quot;, PIE &quot;see&quot;.
* However, Iranic usually expresses &quot;one&quot; and &quot;eye&quot; with words like &quot;aiwa-&quot; and &quot;čašman-&quot; (Ossetian &quot;īw&quot; and &quot;cæst&quot;).
* Other scholars reject Herodotus&#x27; etymology and derive the ethnonym Arimaspoi from Iranic &quot;aspa-&quot; &quot;horse&quot; instead.
* Or the first part of the name may reflect something like Iranic &quot;raiwant-&quot; &quot;rich&quot;, cf. Ossetian &quot;riwæ&quot; &quot;rich&quot;.

=== Scythian theonyms ===

=== Pliny the Elder ===
Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (AD 77–79) derives the name of the Caucasus from the Scythian &quot;kroy-khasis&quot; = ice-shining, white with snow (cf. Greek &quot;cryos&quot; = ice-cold).

===Aristophanes===

In the comedy works of Aristophanes, the dialects of various Greek people are accurately imitated. In his &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;, a Scythian archer (a member of a police force in Athens) speaks broken Greek, consistently omitting the final &quot;-s&quot; () and &quot;-n&quot; (), using the lenis in place of the aspirate, and once using &quot;ks&quot; () in place of &quot;s&quot; (sigma); these may be used to elucidate the Scythian languages.

<text>Endemism is the state of a species being found only in a single defined geographic location, such as an island, state, nation, country or other defined zone; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. For example, the Cape sugarbird is found exclusively in southwestern South Africa and is therefore said to be &quot;endemic&quot; to that particular part of the world. An endemic species can also be referred to as an &quot;endemism&quot; or, in scientific literature, as an &quot;endemite&quot;. Similarly, many species found in the Western ghats of India are examples of endemism.

Endemism is an important concept in conservation biology for measuring biodiversity in a particular place and evaluating the risk of extinction for species. Endemism is also of interest in evolutionary biology, because it provides clues about how changes in the environment cause species to undergo range shifts (potentially expanding their range into a larger area, or becoming extirpated from an area they once lived), go extinct, or diversify into more species.

The extreme opposite of an endemic species is one with a cosmopolitan distribution, having a global or widespread range.

A rare alternative term for a species that is endemic is &quot;precinctive&quot;, which applies to species (and other taxonomic levels) that are restricted to a defined geographical area. Other terms that sometimes are used interchangeably, but less often, include autochthonal, autochthonic, and indigenous; however, these terms do not reflect the status of a species that specifically belongs only to a determined place.

== Etymology ==
=== History of the concept ===
The word &quot;endemic&quot; is from Neo-Latin &quot;endēmicus&quot;, from Greek ἔνδημος, &quot;éndēmos&quot;, &quot;native&quot;. &quot;Endēmos&quot; is formed of &quot;en&quot; meaning &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;dēmos&quot; meaning &quot;the people&quot;. The word entered the English language as a loan word from French &quot;endémique&quot;, and originally seems to have been used in the sense of diseases that occur at a constant amount in a country, as opposed to epidemic diseases, which are exploding in cases. The word was used in biology in 1872 to mean a species restricted to a specific location by Charles Darwin.

The less common term &#x27;precinctive&#x27; has been used by some entomologists as the equivalent of &#x27;endemic&#x27;. &quot;Precinctive&quot; was coined in 1900 by David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian insects, as he was uncomfortable with the fact that the word &#x27;endemic&#x27; is often associated with diseases. &#x27;Precinctive&#x27; was first used in botany by Vaughan MacCaughey in Hawaii in 1917.

== Overview ==
A species is considered to be endemic to the area where it is found naturally, to the exclusion of other areas; presence in captivity or botanical gardens does not disqualify a species from being endemic. In theory, the term &quot;endemic&quot; could be applied on any scale; for example, the cougar is endemic to the Americas, and all known life is endemic to Earth. However, endemism is normally used only when a species has a relatively small or restricted range. This usage of &quot;endemic&quot; contrasts with &quot;cosmopolitan.&quot; Endemics are not necessarily rare; some might be common where they occur. Likewise, not all rare species are endemics; some may have a large range but be rare throughout this range.

===Origins===

The evolutionary history of a species can lead to endemism in multiple ways. Allopatric speciation, or geographic speciation, is when two populations of a species become geographically separated from each other and as a result develop into different species. In isolated areas where there is little possibility for organisms to disperse to new places, or to receive new gene flow from outside, the rate of endemism is particularly high. For example, many endemic species are found on remote islands, such as Hawaii, the Galápagos Islands and Socotra. Populations on an island are isolated, with little opportunity to interbreed with outside populations, which eventually causes reproductive isolation and separation into different species. Darwin&#x27;s finches in the Galápagos archipelago are examples of species endemic to islands. Similarly, isolated mountainous regions like the Ethiopian Highlands, or large bodies of water far from other lakes, like Lake Baikal, can also have high rates of endemism.

Endemism can also be created in areas which act as refuges for species during times of climate change like ice ages. These changes may have caused species to become repeatedly restricted to regions with unusually stable climate conditions, leading to high concentrations of endemic species in areas resistant to climate fluctuations. Endemic species that used to exist in a much larger area, but died out in most of their range, are called paleoendemic, in contrast to neoendemic species, which are new species that have not dispersed beyond their range. The ginkgo tree, &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;, is one example of a paleoendemic species. 

In many cases, biological factors, such as low rates of dispersal or returning to the spawning area (philopatry), can cause a particular group of organisms to have high speciation rates and thus many endemic species. For example, cichlids in the East African Rift Lakes have diversified into many more endemic species than the other fish families in the same lakes, possibly due to such factors. Plants that become endemic on isolated islands are often those which have a &quot;high&quot; rate of dispersal and are able to reach such islands by being dispersed by birds. While birds are less likely to be endemic to a region based on their ability to disperse via flight, there are over 2,500 species which are considered endemic, meaning that the species is restricted to an area less than .

Microorganisms were traditionally not believed to form endemics. The hypothesis &#x27;everything is everywhere&#x27;, first stated in Dutch by Lourens G.M. Baas Becking in 1934, describes the theory that the distribution of organisms smaller than 2 mm is cosmopolitan where habitats occur that support their growth.

==Subtypes and definitions==
Endemism can reflect a wide variety of evolutionary histories, so researchers often use more specialized terms that categorize endemic species based upon how they came to be endemic to an area. Different categorizations of endemism also capture the uniqueness and irreplaceability of biodiversity hotspots differently and impact how those hotspots are defined, affecting how resources for conservation are allocated. 

The first subcategories were first introduced by Claude P. E. Favager and Juliette Contandriopoulis in 1961: schizoendemics, apoendemics and patroendemics. Using this work, Ledyard Stebbins and Jack Major then introduced the concepts of neoendemics and paleoendemics in 1965 to describe the endemics of California. Endemic taxa can also be classified into autochthonous, allochthonous, taxonomic relicts and biogeographic relicts.

Paleoendemism refers to species that were formerly widespread but are now restricted to a smaller area. Neoendemism refers to species that have recently arisen, such as through divergence and reproductive isolation or through hybridization and polyploidy in plants, and have not dispersed beyond a limited range.

Paleoendemism is more or less synonymous with the concept of a &#x27;relict species&#x27;: a population or taxon of organisms that were more widespread or more diverse in the past. A &#x27;relictual population&#x27; is a population that currently occurs in a restricted area, but whose original range was far wider during a previous geologic epoch. Similarly, a &#x27;relictual taxon&#x27; is a taxon (e.g. species or other lineage) that is the sole surviving representative of a formerly diverse group.

The concept of &quot;phylogenetic endemism&quot; has also been used to measure the relative uniqueness of the species endemic to an area. In measurements that incorporate phylogenetic endemism, branches of the evolutionary tree are weighted by how narrowly they are distributed. This captures not only the total number of taxa endemic to the area (taxonomic endemism), but also how distant those species are from their living relatives.

Schizoendemics, apoendemics and patroendemics can all be classified as types of neoendemics. Schizoendemics arise from a wider distributed taxon that has become reproductively isolated without becoming (potentially) genetically isolated – a schizoendemic has the same chromosome count as the parent taxon it evolved from. An apoendemic is a polyploid of the parent taxon (or taxa in the case of allopolyploids), whereas a patroendemic has a lower, diploid chromosome count than the related, more widely distributed polyploid taxon. Mikio Ono coined the term &#x27;aneuendemics&#x27; in 1991 for species that have more or fewer chromosomes than their relatives due to aneuploidy.

Pseudoendemics are taxa that have possibly recently evolved from a mutation. Holoendemics is a concept introduced by Richardson in 1978 to describe taxa that have remained endemic to a restricted distribution for a very long time.

In a 2000 paper, Myers and de Grave further attempted to redefine the concept. In their view, everything is endemic, even cosmopolitan species are endemic to Earth, and earlier definitions restricting endemics to specific locations are wrong. Thus the subdivisions neoendemics and paleoendemics are without merit regarding the study of distributions, because these concepts consider that an endemic has a distribution limited to one place. Instead, they propose four different categories: holoendemics, euryendemics, stenoendemics and rhoendemics. In their scheme cryptoendemics and euendemics are further subdivisions of rhoendemics. In their view, a holoendemic is a cosmopolitan species. Stenoendemics, also known as local endemics, have a reduced distribution and are synonymous with the word &#x27;endemics&#x27; in the traditional sense, whereas euryendemics have a larger distribution -both these have distributions that are more or less continuous. A rhoendemic has a disjunct distribution. Where this disjunct distribution is caused by vicariance, in a euendemic the vicariance was geologic in nature, such as the movement of tectonic plates, but in a cryptoendemic the disjunct distribution was due to the extinction of the intervening populations. There is yet another possible situation that can cause a disjunct distribution, where a species is able to colonize new territories by crossing over areas of unsuitable habitat, such as plants colonizing an island – this situation they dismiss as extremely rare and do not devise a name for. Traditionally, none of Myers and de Grave&#x27;s categories would be considered endemics except stenoendemics.

==Environments==
Some environments are particularly conducive to the development of endemic species, either because they allow the persistence of relict taxa that were extirpated elsewhere, or because they provide mechanisms for isolation and opportunities to fill new niches.

=== Soil ===
Serpentine soils act as &#x27;edaphic islands&#x27; of low fertility and these soils lead to high rates of endemism. These soils are found in the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey, Alps, Cuba, New Caledonia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the North American Appalachians, and scattered distribution in California, Oregon, and Washington and elsewhere. For example, Mayer and Soltis considered the widespread subspecies &quot;Streptanthus glandulosus&quot; subsp. &quot;glandulosus&quot; which grows on normal soils, to be a paleoendemic, whereas closely related endemic forms of &quot;S. glandulosus&quot; occurring on serpentine soil patches are neoendemics which recently evolved from subsp. &quot;glandulosus&quot;.

=== Caves ===
Obligate cave-dwelling species, known as troglobites, are often endemic to small areas, even to single individual caves, because cave habitats are by nature restricted, isolated, and fragmented. A high level of adaptation to a cave environment limits an organism&#x27;s ability to disperse, since caves are often not connected to each other. One hypothesis for how closely related troglobite species could become isolated from one another in different caves is that their common ancestor may have been less restricted to cave habitats. When climate conditions became unfavorable, the ancestral species was extirpated from the surface, but some populations survived in caves, and diverged into different species due to lack of gene flow between them.

=== Islands ===
Isolated islands commonly develop a number of endemics. Many species and other higher taxonomic groups exist in very small terrestrial or aquatic islands, which restrict their distribution. The Devil&#x27;s Hole pupfish, &quot;Cyprinodon diabolis,&quot; has its whole native population restricted to a spring that is 20 x 3 meters, in Nevada&#x27;s Mojave Desert. This &#x27;aquatic island&#x27; is connected to an underground basin; however, the population present in the pool remains isolated.

Other areas very similar to the Galapagos Islands of the Pacific Ocean exist and foster high rates of endemism. The Socotra Archipelago of Yemen, located in the Indian Ocean, has seen a new endemic species of parasitic leech, &quot;Myxobdella socotrensis,&quot; appear. This species is restricted to freshwater springs, where it may attach to and feed upon native crabs.

=== Mountains ===
Mountains can be seen as &#x27;sky islands&#x27;: refugia of endemics because species that live in the cool climates of mountain peaks are geographically isolated. For example, in the Alpes-Maritimes department of France, &quot;Saxifraga florulenta&quot; is an endemic plant that may have evolved in the Late Miocene and could have once been widespread across the Mediterranean Basin.

Volcanoes also tend to harbor a number of endemic species. Plants on volcanoes tend to fill a specialized ecological niche, with a very restrictive range, due to the unique environmental characteristics. The Kula Volcano, one of the fourteen volcanoes in Turkey, is home to 13 endemic species of plants.

==Conservation==

Endemics might more easily become endangered or extinct because they are already restricted in distribution. This puts endemic plants and animals at greater risk than widespread species during the rapid climate change of this century. Some scientists claim that the presence of endemic species in an area is a good method to find geographical regions that can be considered priorities for conservation. Endemism can thus be studied as a proxy for measuring biodiversity of a region.

The concept of finding endemic species that occur in the same region to designate &#x27;endemism hotspots&#x27; was first proposed by Paul Müller in a 1973 book. According to him, this is only possible where 1.) the taxonomy of the species in question is not in dispute; 2.) the species distribution is accurately known; and 3.) the species have relatively small distributional ranges.

In a 2000 article, Myers &quot;et al&quot;. used the standard of having more than 0.5% of the world&#x27;s plant species being endemic to the region to designate 25 geographical areas of the world as biodiversity hotspots.

In response to the above, the World Wildlife Fund has split the world into a few hundred geographical &#x27;ecoregions&#x27;. These have been designed to include as many species as possible that only occur in a single ecoregion, and these species are thus &#x27;endemics&#x27; to these ecoregions. Since plenty of these ecoregions have a high prevalence of endemics existing within them, many National Parks have been formed around or within them to further promote conservation. The Caparaó National Park was formed in the Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot located in Brazil, in order to help protect valuable and vulnerable species.

Other scientists have argued that endemism is not an appropriate measure of biodiversity, because the levels of threat or biodiversity are not actually correlated to areas of high endemism. When using bird species as an example, it was found that only 2.5% of biodiversity hotspots correlate with endemism and the threatened nature of a geographic region. A similar pattern had been found regarding mammals, &quot;Lasioglossum&quot; bees, Plusiinae moths, and swallowtail butterflies in North America: these different groups of taxa did not correlate geographically with each other regarding endemism and species richness. Especially using mammals as flagship species proved to be a poor system of identifying and protecting areas of high invertebrate biodiversity. In response to this, other scientists again defended the concept by using WWF ecoregions and reptiles, finding that most reptile endemics occur in WWF ecoregions with high biodiversity.

Other conservation efforts for endemics include keeping captive and semi-captive populations in zoological parks and botanical gardens. These methods are &quot;ex situ&quot; (&quot;off-site&quot;) conservation methods. The use of such methods may not only offer refuge and protection for individuals of declining or vulnerable populations, but it may also allow biologists valuable opportunities to research them as well.

<text>Renmark is a town in South Australia&#x27;s rural Riverland area, and is located northeast of Adelaide, on the banks of the River Murray. The Sturt Highway between Adelaide and Sydney runs through the town; Renmark is the last major town encountered in South Australia when driving this route. It is a few kilometres west of the SA–Victoria and SA–NSW borders. It is above sea level.

==History==

It has been suggested that the name Renmark refers to a local Aboriginal word meaning &quot;red mud&quot; (the original inhabitants of the area were the Erawirung people). However, the mud at Renmark is not red. Alternatively, it could be derived from the name Bookmark, later Calperum, the station founded by the Chambers brothers, from which was excised for the town and irrigation project. Another possibility is the name of an early settler in the district, William Renny. Wool was shipped from &quot;Renmark&quot; in 1878, The first unambiguous use of the name (as &quot;Renmark Flat&quot;) in newspapers was in November 1883.

Captain Charles Sturt was the first European to pass through the area in January 1830, as he navigated the length of the Murray River from the Great Dividing Range, eventually reaching Lake Alexandrina.

A settlement began to grow in 1887, when the Renmark Irrigation Settlement was established by George and William Chaffey, who created a system of open drains using water from the Murray River, (called Renmark Irrigation Trust) to allow orchards to be planted in the area. By pumping water onto the hot red sand they transformed it into a fruit growing area similar to California. The Chaffey brothers&#x27; business collapsed in 1893, and the Renmark Irrigation Trust was created to manage the irrigation scheme.

Renmark was proclaimed a town in 1904 and a municipality in 1935.
The Renmark Hotel was the first community-owned hotel in the British Empire and became the town&#x27;s major landmark.

Renmark was connected to Adelaide by rail on 31 January 1927, when the railway line across the bridge to Paringa was opened. It was later extended west as far as Barmera, and known as the Barmera railway line, but then closed in 1983 then the last scheduled train to cross the bridge was on 31 December 1990.

==Heritage listings==

Renmark has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Murray Avenue: Renmark Hotel
* 149 Murray Avenue: Renmark Irrigation Trust Office
* 24 Ral Ral Avenue: Renmark Post Office
* Renmark Avenue: Renmark Distillery Bridge
* Renmark Avenue: Olivewood
* Sturt Highway: Paringa Bridge

==Governance==
Renmark is located within the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of Chaffey and the local government area of the Renmark Paringa Council.

==Tourism, industry and facilities==
Renmark is a multicultural centre for the Riverland area. The river itself offers excellent spots for fishing, waterskiing and boating. The area is known for the cultivation of grapes, citrus fruits, tomatoes, vegetables, wheat and wool. Orange trees stretch for hectares as do vineyards and stone fruit orchards. Other industries include almond growing and pistachio nut cultivation.

Renmark is also home to the region&#x27;s only restored paddle steamer(PS Industry), wine companies and the rose industry. Renmark hosts the Renmark Rose Festival every October.

There is a shopping centre known as Renmark Square, featuring many popular stores, community-owned businesses, and Big W and Woolworths serving as the anchors.

Many camping grounds are along the river, they are popular destinations for tourists in Renmark.

===Murray River National Park===

The Murray River National Park includes two locations near Renmark:
* Paringa Paddock (), including Goat Island, between Renmark and Paringa; and
* Bulyong, or Bulyong Island, on the west side of the river upstream from Renmark, accessible only by boat.

Paringa Paddock (which includes Goat Island) contains areas of riverine woodlands, wetlands and river flats. The floodplain is lined by huge river red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot;) and river box (&quot;Eucalyptus largiflorens&quot;). The wetland complex provides habitat for koalas, birds and reptiles, and the park provides recreation for people of all ages and abilities. There are walking and biking trails developed by the Renmark Paringa Council and the local community. Bulyong is home to many wildlife species, such as western grey kangaroos, emus, pelicans, kingfishers and parrots.

==Media==
The &quot;Murray Pioneer&quot;, a newspaper founded in 1892 as the &quot;Renmark Pioneer&quot;, is printed in Renmark.

Channels from the following television networks are available in Renmark:
* ABC Television (ABC)
* SBS Television (SBS) 
* WIN Television (7, 9 &amp; 10) as RTS-5A &amp; LRS-34 relays the programming from Seven Network (Seven SA), Nine Network (Nine SA) &amp; Network Ten (Ten SA), Sky News Regional and Fox Sports News, with local commercials inserted

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) broadcasts a local radio station, ABC Riverland (1062 AM), along with national stations ABC Radio National (1305 AM); ABC News Radio (93.9 FM); ABC Classic (105.1 FM) and Triple J (101.9 FM).

In addition, there are commercial radio stations, including 5RM (801 AM); KIX Country (1557 AM); Magic 93.1 (93.1 FM); TAB Racing Network (95.5 FM) and Riverland Life (100.7 FM). 

== Sport ==
Sporting teams
* Renmark Olympic (football)
* Renmark Rovers (australian rules)
* Renmark Royals (cricket)

There is a speedway venue known as the Riverland Speedway, off the Sturt Highway to the southwest of the town (). It holds stock car racing, sedans, sprint and speed cars. The 380 metres dirt oval speedway track has hosted numerous Australian Speedway Championships for both motorbikes and cars including the Australian Solo Championship, Australian Street Stock Championship and the Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship. It hosted the Australian Under-21 Individual Speedway Championship in 2009.

The town also has the Renmark Oval, a football ground featuring a seating capacity of about 5,000 people, it includes space for venues, and it is the home of the Renmark Rovers.

==Climate==
Renmark experiences a cold desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with hot, dry summers (though which are subject to cold fronts on account of the western longitude); warm to mild springs and autumns; and cool, sometimes cloudy winters. Renmark is surrounded by mallee scrub, and is situated in a grassland location, north of Goyder&#x27;s Line.

Due to its geographical location, summers are a few degrees hotter than those of Adelaide; although it has many more touches of frost in the winter, and it also lacks Adelaide&#x27;s sizeable winter precipitation. The average rainfall of Renmark is , peaking somewhat in spring; falling as thunderstorms and/or cold fronts in summer; cold fronts and Northwest cloudbands in winter, and a combination of the three in spring and autumn. 

Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 20 December 2019 to on 18 June 1998 at the Aero site. Furthermore on 5 January 2020, Renmark registered a new record low maximum of just for any summer month; this extraordinarily low maximum was nearly four degrees lower than its previous January low maximum set back in 1983 at the old town site.

<text>Struve is the lava-flooded remains of a lunar impact crater. It is located near the western extreme of the Oceanus Procellarum, close to the western lunar limb. As a consequence, even though it is roughly circular in outline, it appears oval due to foreshortening.

The northern rim of this crater intersects the smaller lava-flooded crater Russell to the north, and there is now a wide gap between the two formations. Attached to the southeast rim is the remains of another lava-flooded formation, Eddington. Farther to the southwest is Balboa, near the lunar limb.

The rim of Struve is heavily worn and irregular, with several gaps connecting to the surrounding mare. It resembles little more than a circular mountain range, climbing to a maximum height of 1.7 km. There are several small impact craters within the wall, most notably in the southeast part of the crater. The crater Struve G overlaps the inner part of the western rim, and just to the north of this crater is a gap in the wall that connects to the Oceanus Procellarum between the rims of Russell and Eddington.

On older maps this formation was named Otto Struve. It now honors three members of the same family, all astronomers.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Struve.

<text>Schickard is a lunar impact crater of the form called a walled plain. It lies in the southwest sector of the Moon, near the lunar limb. As a result, the crater appears oblong due to foreshortening. Attached to the northern rim is the lesser crater Lehmann, and to the northeast is the even smaller Drebbel. Southwest of Schickard is Wargentin, a lava-flooded plateau.

Schickard has a worn rim that is overlain in several locations by smaller impact craters. The most prominent of these is the irregular Schickard E across the southeastern rim. The floor of Schickard has been partially flooded by lava, leaving only the southwest portion uncovered and rough-textured.

Schickard&#x27;s floor is marked with a triangular band of lighter-albedo material, leaving relatively darker patches in the north and southeast. This feature is more prominent when the Sun is at a relatively high angle. There are also multiple small crater impacts on the floor, most notably in the southwest.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Schickard.

<doc id="937992" wikidata="Q1248394" url="?curid=937992" title="Edward Forbes">
<text>Edward Forbes FRS, FGS (12 February 1815 – 18 November 1854) was a Manx naturalist. In 1846, he proposed that the distributions of montane plants and animals had been compressed downslope, and some oceanic islands connected to the mainland, during the recent ice age. This mechanism, which was the first natural explanation to explain the distributions of the same species on now-isolated islands and mountain tops, was discovered independently by Charles Darwin, who credited Forbes with the idea. He also incorrectly deduced the so-called azoic hypothesis, that life under the sea would decline to the point that no life forms could exist below a certain depth.

==Early years==
Forbes was born at Douglas on the Isle of Man. His father was a well-to-do banker. As a child, Forbes was very interested in collecting insects, shells, minerals, fossils, and plants. Due to poor health, he was unable to attend school from his 5th through his 11th years. In 1828, he started attending the Athole House Academy in Douglas.

In June 1831, Forbes moved to London to study drawing but was not admitted by the Royal Academy. However, having given up on art as a profession, he trained privately and moved back to Douglas. In later years, Forbes used his artistic abilities to create humorous drawings for his publications.

In November 1832, Forbes matriculated as a medical student in the University of Edinburgh attending the lectures of Robert Jameson and Robert Knox while also being active in student societies. In 1832, he studied the natural history of the Isle of Man. Forbes&#x27;s brother David was a notable mineralogist.

==Travels==

In 1833, Forbes travelled to Norway to study its botanical resources. His findings were published in Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Magazine of Natural History&quot; for 1835–1836. The British Association funded his studies based on dredging in the Irish Sea for biological specimens. In 1835, he travelled in France, Switzerland and Germany to study their natural histories.

In 1836, Forbes abandoned his medical studies and moved to Paris, where he attended the lectures at the Jardin des Plantes on natural history, comparative anatomy, geology and mineralogy. In April 1837, Forbes traveled to Algiers to gather material for a paper on land and freshwater Mollusca. The paper was published in the &quot;Annals of Natural History&quot;, vol. ii. p. 250. He remained in Edinburgh, paid for by his father.

In 1838, Forbes published his first volume, &quot;Malacologia Monensis&quot;, a synopsis of the mollusk species native to the Isle of Man. During the summer of 1838 he visited the Duchy of Styria (now part of Austria and Slovenia) and Carniola in Slovenia to gather botanical specimens.

==Scholarly years==

===Marine biology===
In 1838, Forbes presented a paper to the British Association at Newcastle on the distribution of terrestrial Pulmonata in Europe. He was then commissioned to prepare a survey on pulmonata in the British Isles. In 1841, Forbes published his &quot;History of British star-fishes&quot;, embodying extensive observations and containing 120 illustrations, all designed by Forbes.

On 17 April 1841, Forbes and naturalist William Thompson, joined at Malta HM surveying ship &quot;Beacon&quot;, to which he had been appointed naturalist by her commander Captain Thomas Graves (1802–1856). From April 1841 until October 1842, Forbes investigated the botany, zoology and geology of the Mediterranean region.

In 1843, Forbes presented a &quot;Report on the Mollusca and Radiata of the Aegean Sea&quot;, to the British Association. In the report, he discussed the influence of climate and of the nature and depth of the sea bottom upon marine life. He divided the Aegean region into eight biological zones. In his azoic hypothesis, Forbes stated that the sea regions below 300 fathom were entirely devoid of life. This hypothesis was disproved 25 years later.

In 1847, Forbes published &quot;Travels in Lycia&quot; with Lieut. T. A. B. Spratt. In 1848, he published his monograph on jellyfish, the &quot;British Naked-eyed Medusae&quot; (Ray Society).

In 1852, Forbes published the fourth and concluding volume of Forbes and S. Hanley&#x27;s &quot;History of British Mollusca&quot; He also published his &quot;Monograph of the Echinodermata of the British Tertiaries&quot; (Palaeontographical Soc.).

===Posts in London===
In 1842, financial pressures forced Forbes to take the curatorship of the museum of the Geological Society of London. In 1843, he also became a professor botany at King&#x27;s College London.

In November 1844, Forbes resigned the curatorship and became palaeontologist to the Geological Survey of Great Britain. Trilobite leading authority John William Salter was appointed on the staff of the Geological Survey and worked under Edward Forbes until 1854. Salter replaced Forbes as palaeontologist to the survey and gave his chief attention to the Palaeozoic fossils, spending much time in Wales and the border counties.

On 26 August 1848, Forbes married Emily Marianne Ashworth, the daughter of General Sir Charles Ashworth.

===Botanical studies===
In 1846, Forbes published in the &quot;Memoirs of the Geological Survey&quot; his important essay &quot;On the Connection between the distribution of the existing Fauna and Flora of the British Isles, and the Geological Changes which have affected their Area, especially during the epoch of the Northern Drift&quot;.

In this essay, Forbes divided the plants of Great Britain into five geographic groups and compared them to other regions in Europe: 
*The West and Southwest Irish group, related to flora from Northern Spain
*The Southeast Irish and Southwest English group, related to flora of the Channel Islands and nearby coastal France
*The Southeast English group, characterized by species from the Northern French coast
*The mountain summits group, related to Scandinavian flora
*A general or Germanic flora group

Forbes theorized that the majority of British terrestrial animals and flowering plants migrated there over land bridges before, during and after the ice age. His theory was later discredited. (see C Reid&#x27;s &quot;Origin of the British Flora&quot;, 1899).

In 1851 Forbes was professor of natural history to the Royal School of Mines.

In 1852 Forbes submitted an abstract to the 22nd Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Belfast. He described the fossil plant &quot;Cyclopteris hyberinca&quot;, now &quot;Archaeopteris hybernica&quot; (E.Forbs) Stur. This is the type species of the genus &quot;Archaeopteris&quot; (Dawson) Sturr. The genus is often incorrectly attributed to John William Dawson (1871), but correctly attributed to (1875).

Forbes served as an important mentor to the young biologist Thomas Henry Huxley. During Huxley&#x27;s 1846 to 1850 voyage on to Northern Australia, Huxley relayed news of his discoveries back to Forbes in the United Kingdom, who then published them.

Forbes provided Huxley with introductions to influential people, wrote a favorable review of Huxley&#x27;s work, and helped his admission to the Royal Society (FRS) at age 26.

=== Illustrations ===
Forbes&#x27;s scientific illustrations have been said to be anthropomorphic, often just hiding a human form even when depicting an invertebrate.
==Final years==

In 1853 Forbes became president of the Geological Society of London. In 1854, he was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Edinburgh, a long sought goal. During his later years, Forbes found more time in between lecturing and writing to order his stores of biological information.

In the summer of 1854, Forbes lectured at Edinburgh and in September served as president of the geological section at the Liverpool meeting of the British Science Association. He served briefly as Professor of Natural History in succession to Prof Robert Jameson.

In November 1854, soon after the start of winter classes at Edinburgh, Forbes became ill. He died at Wardie Parish, near Edinburgh, on 18 November 1854. He was interred at the Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh.

In 1859, a former student of Forbes; James Hector dedicated Mount Forbes in what is now Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada to his memory.

The following Forbes works were issued posthumously:

*&quot;On the Tertiary Fluviomarine Formation of the Isle of Wight&quot; (Geol. Survey), edited by RAC Godwin-Austen (1856)
*&quot;The Natural History of the European Seas&quot;, edited and continued by RAC Godwin-Austen (1859).
Forbes&#x27;s widow provided papers to George Wilson to write up the memoirs of Forbes. Wilson however died in 1859 and his sister then passed on the papers to Archibald Geikie who had met Forbes only twice. Forbes&#x27;s widow married Major Yelverton in 1858 and forbade Geikie to work on the memoirs, seeking back all the papers. Forbes&#x27;s brother however wished that Geikie finish the book as did the publisher Alexander Macmillan. In 1860, it was found that Yelverton had earlier married Maria Teresa Longworth and the separation had not been made with a witness. Yelverton was accused of bigamy and Teresa Longworth wrote about her plight in a book &quot;Martyrs to Circumstance.&quot; Mrs Forbes had two sons by Yelverton and with the case being in the limelight, she had no time to apply pressure on Geikie. Geikie however had to exercise considerable diplomacy while writing the biography as Forbes had claimed that he had been sufficiently remunerated by the School of Mines.

<doc id="937997" wikidata="Q35959" url="?curid=937997" title="Hunnic language">
<text>The Hunnic language, or Hunnish, was the language spoken by Huns in the Hunnic Empire, a heterogeneous, multi-ethnic tribal confederation which invaded Eastern and Central Europe, and ruled most of Pannonian Central Europe, during the 4th and 5th centuries CE. A variety of languages were spoken within the Hun Empire. A contemporary report by Priscus has that Hunnish was spoken alongside Gothic and the languages of other tribes subjugated by the Huns.

As no inscriptions or whole sentences in the Hunnic language have been preserved, the attested corpus is very limited, consisting almost entirely of proper names in Greek and Latin sources.

There is no consensus on the classification of the Hunnish language, but due to the origin of these proper names it has been compared with Turkic, Mongolic, Iranian, and Yeniseian languages, and with various Indo-European languages. Other scholars consider the available evidence inconclusive and the Hunnish language therefore unclassifiable.

==Corpus==
Contemporary observers of the European Huns, such as Priscus and the 6th century historian Jordanes, preserved three words of the language of the Huns: 

The words , a beverage akin to mead, , a barley drink, and , a funeral feast, are of Indo-European origin, possibly Slavic, Germanic and/or Iranian. Maenchen-Helfen argued that &quot;strava&quot; may have come from an informant who spoke Slavic.

All other information on the Hunnic language is contained in the form of personal and tribal names.

==Possible affiliations==
Many of the waves of nomadic peoples who swept into Eastern Europe, are known to have spoken languages from a variety of families. Several proposals for the affinities of Hunnic have been made, however there is no consensus.

===Unclassifiable===
Given the small corpus, a number of scholars hold the Hunnic language to be unclassifiable until further evidence, if any, is discovered. András Róna-Tas notes that &quot;the very scant sources of information are often mutually contradictory.&quot;

===Turkic or Altaic &quot;sprachbund&quot;===
A number of historians and linguists including Karl Heinrich Menges, and Omeljan Pritsak feel that the proper names only allow the Hunnic language to be positioned in relationship to the Altaic language group, which is itself a widely discredited language family. Although Menges was reserved towards the language evidence, his view of the Huns was that &quot;there are ethnological reasons for considering them Turkic or close to the Turks&quot;. As further possibilities, Menges suggests that the Huns could have spoken a Mongolian or Tungusic language, or possibly a language between Mongolian and Turkic. Pritsak analyzed 33 surviving Hunnic personal names and concluded: &quot;It was not a Turkic language, but one between Turkic and Mongolian, probably closer to the former than the latter. The language had strong ties to Bulgar language and to modern Chuvash, but also had some important connections, especially lexical and morphological, to Ottoman Turkish and Yakut&quot;.

According to Savelyev-Jeong (2020), the &quot;traditional and prevailing view is [...] that the Xiongnu and/or the Huns were Turkic or at least Altaic&quot; speakers. Otto Maenchen-Helfen argues that many tribal and proper names among the Huns appear to have originated in Turkic languages, indicating that the language was Turkic. Hyun Jin Kim similarly concluded that it &quot;seems highly likely then from the names that we do know, most of which seem to be Turkic, that the Hunnic elite was predominantly Turkic-speaking&quot;. Denis Sinor, while skeptical of our ability to classify Hunnic as a whole, states that part of the Hunnish elite likely spoke Turkic, though he notes that some Hunnic names cannot be Turkic in origin. The historian Peter Heather, while he supported the Turkic hypothesis as the &quot;best guess&quot; in 1995, has since voiced skepticism, in 2010 saying that &quot;the truth is that we don&#x27;t know what language the Huns spoke, and probably never will&quot;. Savelyev and Jeong similarly note that &quot;the majority of the previously proposed Turkic etymologies for the Hunnic names are far from unambiguous, so no firm conclusion can be drawn from this type of data.&quot;

===Yeniseian===
Some scholars – most notably Lajos Ligeti (1950/51) and Edwin G. Pulleyblank (1962) – have claimed that languages of Siberia, especially Ket – a member of the Yeniseian language family – may have been a major source (or perhaps even the linguistic core) of the Xiongnu and/or Hunnic languages. First proposed by Edwin G. Pulleyblank, the theory that the Xiongnu language belonged to the Yeniseian languages was reinforced by the discovery of the Kot and Pumpokol word lists, which Alexander Vovin used to create a more accurate reconstruction. Hyun Jin Kim in 2013 proposed that the Huns experienced a language flip like the Chagatai Khanate, switching from Yeniseian to Oghuric Turkic after absorbing the Dingling or Tiele peoples.

Vajda (et al. 2013) proposed that the ruling elite of the Huns spoke a Yeniseian language and influenced other languages in the region. The Yeniseian people were likely assimilated later by Turkic and Mongolic groups.

Alexander Savelyev and Choongwon Jeong criticize the Yeniseian proposal by Pulleyblank and note that the more convincing Yeniseian words may be shared cultural vocabulary that was non-native to both the Xiongnu and the Yeniseians.

===Indo-European===
All three words described as &quot;Hunnic&quot; by ancient sources appear to be Indo-European.

A number of scholars suggest that a Germanic language, possibly Gothic, may have coexisted with another Hunnic language as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Hunnic Empire. Maenchen-Helfen suggests that the words &quot;medos&quot; and &quot;kamos&quot; could possibly be of Germanic origin. He argues that &quot;Attila&quot;, &quot;Bleda&quot;, &quot;Laudaricus&quot;, &quot;Onegesius&quot;, &quot;Ragnaris&quot;, and &quot;Ruga&quot; are Germanic, while Heather also includes the names &quot;Scottas&quot; and &quot;Berichus&quot;. Kim questions the Germanic etymologies of &quot;Ruga&quot;, &quot;Attila&quot;, and &quot;Bleda&quot;, arguing that there are &quot;more probable Turkic etymologies.&quot; Elsewhere, he argues that the Germanicization of Hunnic names may have been a conscious policy of the Hunnic elite in the Western part of the Empire.

Maenchen-Helfen also classified some names as having roots in Iranian. Christopher Atwood has argued, as one explanation for his proposed etymology of the name &quot;Hun&quot; that, &quot;their state or confederation must be seen as the result of Sogdian/Baktrian [Iranian-speaking] leadership and organization&quot;. Subjects of the Huns included Iranian-speaking Alans and Sarmatians, Maenchen-Helfen argues that the Iranian names were likely borrowed from the Persians and finds none prior to the 5th century; he takes this to mean that the Alans had little influence inside of Attila&#x27;s empire. Kim, however, argues for a considerable presence of Iranian-speakers among the Huns.

The word &quot;strava&quot; has been argued to be of Slavic origin and to show a presence of Slavic speakers among the Huns. Peter Heather, however, argues that this word &quot;is certainly a very slender peg upon which to hang the claim that otherwise undocumented Slavs played a major role in Attila&#x27;s empire&quot;. In the 19th century, some Russian scholars argued that the Huns as a whole had spoken a Slavic language.

===Uralic===
In the 19th century, some scholars, such as German Sinologist Julius Heinrich Klaproth, argued that the Huns had spoken a Finno-Ugric language and connected them with the ancient Hungarians.

==Possible script==
It is possible that a written form of Hunnic existed and may yet be identified from artifacts. Priscus recorded that Hunnic secretaries read out names of fugitives from a written list. Franz Altheim considered it was not Greek or Latin, but a script like the Oguric Turkic of the Bulgars. He argued that the runes were brought into Europe from Central Asia by the Huns, and were an adapted version of the old Sogdian alphabet in the Hunnic (Oghur Turkic) language. Zacharias Rhetor wrote that in 507/508 AD, Bishop Qardust of Arran went to the land of the Caucasian Huns for seven years, and returned with books written in the Hunnic language. There is some debate as to whether a Xiongnu-Xianbei runic system existed, and was part of a wider Eurasian script which gave rise to the Old Turkic alphabet in the 8th century.

<text>Trinidad and Tobago competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent nation, although it had previously appeared in four editions as part of the British colony and the West Indies Federation. 
Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee sent a total of nineteen athletes to the Games, ten men and nine women, to compete only in track and field (the largest by sport), shooting, swimming, and taekwondo, which made its Olympic debut; the nation&#x27;s team size was relatively similar to the record in Sydney four years earlier.

Eight athletes from the Trinidad and Tobago team had previously competed in Sydney, including swimmer and double Pan American Games champion George Bovell, sprinters Ato Modibo, who later married to Caymanian athlete Cydonie Mothersille, and Ato Boldon, who became the most decorated athlete for Trinidad and Tobago with a staggering record of four Olympic medals. Because of his repeated successes and being the most sophisticated athlete of the team as a four-time Olympian, Boldon reprised his role to carry the Trinidad and Tobago flag in the opening ceremony for the second time.

Trinidad and Tobago left Athens with a remarkable historic milestone from George Bovell, being the nation&#x27;s first ever swimmer to win an Olympic bronze medal in the men&#x27;s 200 m individual medley.

<doc id="938001" wikidata="Q7026704" url="?curid=938001" title="Nick Altrock">
<text>Nicholas Altrock (September 15, 1876 – January 20, 1965) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in the major leagues as a left-handed pitcher between 1898 and 1919. After the 1919 season he continued to make periodic appearances as a pinch hitter for many years, until his final game at the age of 57. As a player, Altrock was a member of two World Series winning teams and then won a third World Series as a coach. He was a coach for the Washington Senators for many years.

==Early life==
Altrock was born in Cincinnati, to German immigrant parents.

==Career==
Altrock was one of the better pitchers in baseball for a brief period from to with the Chicago White Sox. He was instrumental in the White Sox World Series championship in 1906, going 20–13 with a 2.06 earned run average in the regular season and 1–1 with a Series-best 1.00 earned run average against the Chicago Cubs.
An arm injury after 1906 ruined his career, but he hung on with the White Sox and Washington Senators until , though he pitched very little after and made sporadic pinch-hitting appearances after that, including one in (facing Rube Walberg of the Philadelphia Athletics) at 57 years of age. He appeared in major league games in five different decades, one of only two players to do this (Minnie Miñoso is the other); he is one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four decades.

Altrock became a coach for the Senators in and remained on the Washington staff through , a 42-year skein that represents the longest consecutive-year tenure of a coach with the same franchise in baseball history. Some Senator scorecards continued to list Altrock as a &quot;coach emeritus&quot; even after his formal retirement.
During that time, he was noted for his antics in the coaching box and teamed with Al Schacht, the &quot;Clown Prince of Baseball&quot;, for a dozen years to perform comedy routines on baseball fields in the days before official mascots. Schacht and Altrock also took their antics to the vaudeville stage where they appeared in a comedy routine. At the height of their collaboration, Schacht and Altrock developed a deep personal animosity and stopped speaking with each other off the field. During their famous comic re-enactments of the Dempsey–Tunney championship boxing match, many speculated that they pulled no punches as they rained blows on each other.

An anecdote, probably apocryphal, has been printed in some baseball books about a quip by Altrock during his coaching days with the Senators. A batter had hit a ball into the stands and it was not known whether it was fair or foul. The umpire, who had been the target of Altrock&#x27;s gibes, made the call and shortly afterward a woman was carried from the stands on a litter. The umpire asked Altrock if the ball had hit the woman. In his clear voice, Nick answered, &quot;No. You called that one right and she passed out from shock.&quot;

He was the second oldest position player to play in a major league game when he played in 1933 at the age of 57.

==Later life==
Altrock lived for many years in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his wife Eleanor, and died at age 88 in 1965. He is interred at Vine Street Hill Cemetery in Cincinnati.

<doc id="938004" wikidata="Q1156226" url="?curid=938004" title="Lancelet">
<text>The lancelets ( ), also known as amphioxi (: amphioxus ), consist of 32 described species of &quot;fish-like&quot; benthic filter feeding chordates in the subphylum Cephalochordata, class Leptocardii, and family Branchiostomatidae.

Lancelets diverged from other chordates during or prior to the Cambrian period. A number of fossil chordates have been suggested to be closely related to lancelets, including &quot;Pikaia&quot; and &quot;Cathaymyrus&quot; from the Cambrian and &quot;Palaeobranchiostoma&quot; from the Permian, but their close relationship to lancelets has been doubted by other authors. Molecular clock analysis suggests that modern lancelets probably diversified much more recently, during the Cretaceous or Cenozoic.

Zoologists are interested in them because they provide evolutionary insight into the origins of vertebrates. Lancelets contain many organs and organ systems that are homologous to those of modern fish, but in a more primitive form. Therefore, they provide a number of examples of possible evolutionary exaptation. For example, the gill-slits of lancelets are used for feeding only, and not for respiration. The circulatory system carries food throughout their body, but does not have red blood cells or hemoglobin for transporting oxygen. 

Lancelet genomes hold clues about the early evolution of vertebrates: by comparing genes from lancelets with the same genes in vertebrates, changes in gene expression, function and number as vertebrates evolved can be discovered. The genome of a few species in the genus &quot;Branchiostoma&quot; have been sequenced: &quot;B. floridae,&quot; &quot;B. belcheri&quot;, and &quot;B. lanceolatum&quot;.

In Asia, lancelets are harvested commercially as food for humans. In Japan, amphioxus (&quot;B. belcheri&quot;) has been listed in the registry of &quot;Endangered Animals of Japanese Marine and Fresh Water Organisms&quot;.

== Ecology ==

=== Habitat ===
Adult amphioxus typically inhabit the seafloor, burrowing into well-ventilated substrates characterized by a soft texture and minimal organic content. While various species have been observed in different types of substrate, such as fine sand, coarse sand, and shell deposits, most exhibit a distinct preference for coarse sand with low levels of fine particles. For instance, Branchiostoma nigeriense along the west coast of Africa, Branchiostoma caribaeum in Mississippi Sound and along the coast from South Carolina to Georgia, B. senegalense in the offshore shelf region off North West Africa, and B. lanceolatum along the Mediterranean coast of southern France all demonstrate this preference (Webb and Hill, 1958; Webb, 1958; Boschung and Gunter, 1962; Cory and Pierce, 1967; Gosselck and Spittler, 1979; Caccavale et al., 2021b; Desdevises et al., 2011). However, Branchiostoma floridae from Tampa Bay, Florida, appears to be an exception to this trend, favoring fine sand bottoms instead (Stokes and Holland, 1996a; Stokes, 1996).

All amphioxus species exhibit gonochorism, with only rare instances of hermaphroditism reported in &quot;Branchiostoma lanceolatum &quot; and &quot;B. belcheri&quot;. In these cases, a small number of female gonads were observed within male individuals, typically ranging from 2 to 5 gonads out of a total of 45–50. An extraordinary occurrence of complete sex reversal was documented in B. belcheri, where a female amphioxus raised in laboratory conditions underwent a transformation into a male (Zhang et al., 2001).

=== Feeding ===
Their habitat preference reflects their feeding method: they only expose the front end to the water and filter-feed on plankton by means of a branchial ciliary current that passes water through a mucous sheet. &quot;Branchiostoma floridae&quot; is capable of trapping particles from microbial to small phytoplankton size, while &quot;B. lanceolatum&quot; preferentially traps bigger particles (&gt;4 μm).

=== Reproduction and spawning ===
Lancelets are gonochoric animals, i.e. having two sexes, and they reproduce via external fertilization. They only reproduce during their spawning season, which varies slightly between species — usually corresponding to spring and summer months. All lancelets species spawn shortly after sunset, either synchronously (e.g. &quot;Branchiostoma floridae&quot;, about once every two weeks during spawning season) or asynchronously (&quot;Branchiostoma lanceolatum&quot;, gradual spawning through the season).

Nicholas and Linda Holland were the first researchers to describe a method of obtaining amphioxus embryos by induction of spawning in captivity and in vitro fertilization. Spawning can be artificially induced in the lab by electric or thermal shock.

== History ==

=== Taxonomy ===

The first representative organism of the group to be described was &quot;Branchiostoma lanceolatum&quot;. It was described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1774 as molluscan slugs in the genus &quot;Limax&quot;. It was not until 1834 that Gabriel Costa brought the phylogenetic position of the group closer to the agnathan vertebrates (hagfish and lampreys), including it in the new genus &quot;Branchiostoma&quot; (from the Greek, branchio = &quot;gills&quot;, stoma = &quot;mouth&quot;). In 1836, Yarrell renamed the genus as &quot;Amphioxus&quot; (from the Greek: &quot;pointed on both sides&quot;), now considered an obsolete synonym of the genus &quot;Branchiostoma&quot;. Today, the term &quot;amphioxus&quot; is still used as a common name for the Amphioxiformes, along with &quot;lancelet&quot;, especially in the English language.

All living lancelets are all placed in the family Branchiostomatidae, class Leptocardii, and subphylum Cephalochordata. The family was first named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1846, though he used the incorrect spelling &quot;Branchiostomidae&quot;. One year previously, Johannes Müller had introduced the name Leptocardii as a subclass.
Finally, the subphylum name Cephalochordata is attributed to Ernst Haeckel (1866). At the taxonomic rank of order, lancelets are sometimes placed in the order Amphioxi Bonaparte, 1846, Amphioxiformes Berg, 1937, or Branchiostomiformes Fowler, 1947. Another name sometimes used for high-ranked taxa for the lancelets is Acrania Haeckel, 1866.

=== Anatomy ===
Observations of amphioxus anatomy began in the middle of the 19th century. First, the adult then the embryonic anatomy were described.

Alexander Kowalevsky first described the key anatomical features of the adult amphioxus (hollow dorsal nerve tube, endostyle, segmented body, postanal tail). De Quatrefages first completely described the nervous system of amphioxus. Other important contributions to amphioxus adult anatomy were given by Heinrich Rathke and John Goodsir.

Kowalevsky also released the first complete description of amphioxus embryos, while Schultze and Leuckart were the first to describe the larvae. Other important contributions to amphioxus embryonic anatomy were given by Hatschek, Conklin and later by Tung (experimental embryology).

== Anatomy ==

The larvae are extremely asymmetrical, with the mouth and anus on the left side, and the gill slits on the right side. Organs associated with the pharynx are positioned either exclusively on the left or on the right side of the body. In addition, segmented muscle blocks and parts of the nervous system are asymmetrical. After metamorphosis the anatomy becomes more symmetrical, but some asymmetrical traits are still present also as adults, such as the nervous system and the location of the gonads which are found on the right side in Asymmetron and Epigonichthys (in Branchiostoma gonads develop on both sides of body).

Depending on the exact species involved, the maximum length of lancelets is typically . &quot;Branchiostoma belcheri&quot; and &quot;B. lanceolatum&quot; are among the largest. Except for the size, the species are very similar in general appearance, differing mainly in the number of myotomes and the pigmentation of their larvae. They have a translucent, somewhat fish-like body, but without any paired fins or other limbs. A relatively poorly developed tail fin is present, so they are not especially good swimmers. While they do possess some cartilage material stiffening the gill slits, mouth, and tail, they have no true complex skeleton.

=== Nervous system and notochord ===
In common with vertebrates, lancelets have a hollow nerve cord running along the back, pharyngeal slits and a tail that runs past the anus. Also like vertebrates, the muscles are arranged in blocks called myomeres.

Unlike vertebrates, the dorsal nerve cord is not protected by bone but by a simpler notochord made up of a cylinder of cells that are closely packed in collagen fibers to form a toughened rod. The lancelet notochord, unlike the vertebrate spine, extends into the head. This gives the subphylum, Cephalochordata, its name (, &quot;kephalē&quot; means &#x27;head&#x27;). The fine structure of the notochord and the cellular basis of its adult growth are best known for the Bahamas lancelet, &quot;Asymmetron lucayanum&quot;

The nerve cord is only slightly larger in the head region than in the rest of the body, so that lancelets do not appear to possess a true brain. However, developmental gene expression and transmission electron microscopy indicate the presence of a diencephalic forebrain, a possible midbrain, and a hindbrain. Recent studies involving a comparison with vertebrates indicate that the vertebrate thalamus, pretectum, and midbrain areas jointly correspond to a single, combined region in the amphioxus, which has been termed &quot;di-mesencephalic primordium&quot; (DiMes).

=== Visual system ===
Lancelets have four known kinds of light-sensing structures: Joseph cells, Hesse organs, an unpaired anterior eye and lamellar body, all of which utilize opsins as light receptors. All of these organs and structures are located in the neural tube, with the frontal eye at the front, followed by the lamellar body, the Joseph cells, and the Hesse organs.

==== Joseph cells and Hesse organs ====
Joseph cells are bare photoreceptors surrounded by a band of microvilli. These cells bear the opsin melanopsin. The Hesse organs (also known as dorsal ocelli) consist of a photoreceptor cell surrounded by a band of microvilli and bearing melanopsin, but half enveloped by a cup-shaped pigment cell. The peak sensitivity of both cells is ~470 nm (blue).

Both the Joseph cells and Hesse organs are in the neural tube, the Joseph cells forming a dorsal column, the Hesse organs in the ventral part along the length of the tube. The Joseph cells extend from the caudal end of the anterior vesicle (or cerebral vesicle) to the boundary between myomeres three and four, where the Hesse organs begin and continue nearly to the tail.

==== Frontal eye ====
The frontal eye consists of a pigment cup, a group of photoreceptor cells (termed &quot;Row 1&quot;), three rows of neurons (&quot;Rows 2–4&quot;), and glial cells. The frontal eye, which expresses the PAX6 gene, has been proposed as the homolog of vertebrate paired eyes,or the pineal eye on vertebrates, the pigment cup as the homolog of the RPE (retinal pigment epithelium), the putative photoreceptors as homologs of vertebrate rods and cones, and Row 2 neurons as homologs of the retinal ganglion cells.

The pigment cup is oriented concave dorsally. Its cells contain the pigment melanin.

The putative photoreceptor cells, Row 1, are arranged in two diagonal rows, one on either side of the pigment cup, symmetrically positioned with respect to the ventral midline. The cells are flask-shaped, with long, slender ciliary processes (one cilium per cell). The main bodies of the cells lie outside of the pigment cup, while the cilia extend into the pigment cup before turning and exiting. The cells bear the opsin &quot;c-opsin 1&quot;, except for a few which carry &quot;c-opsin 3&quot;.

The Row 2 cells are serotonergic neurons in direct contact with Row 1 cells. Row 3 and 4 cells are also neurons. Cells of all four rows have axons that project into the left and right ventrolateral nerves. For Row 2 neurons, axon projections have been traced to the tegmental neuropil. The tegmental neuropil has been compared with locomotor control regions of the vertebrate hypothalamus, where paracrine release modulates locomotor patterns such as feeding and swimming.

=== Fluorescent proteins ===
Lancelets naturally express green fluorescent proteins (GFP) inside their oral tentacles and near the eye spot. Depending on the species, it can also be expressed in the tail and gonads, though this is only reported in the Asymmetron genus. Multiple fluorescent protein genes have been recorded in lancelet species throughout the world. &quot;Branchiostoma floridae&quot; alone has 16 GFP-encoding genes. However, the GFP produced by lancelets is more similar to GFP produced by copepods than jellyfish (&quot;Aequorea victoria&quot;).

It is suspected GFP plays multiple roles with lancelets such as attracting plankton towards their mouth. Considering that lancelets are filter feeders, the natural current would draw nearby plankton into the digestive tract. GFP is also expressed in larvae, signifying it may be used for photoprotection by converting higher energy blue light to less harmful green light.

The fluorescent proteins from lancelets have been adapted for use in molecular biology and microscopy. The yellow fluorescent protein from &quot;Branchiostoma lanceolatum&quot; exhibits unusually high quantum yield (~0.95). It has been engineered into a monomeric green fluorescent protein known as mNeonGreen, which is the brightest known monomeric green or yellow fluorescent protein.

=== Feeding and digestive system ===
Lancelets are passive filter feeders, spending most of the time half-buried in sand with only their frontal part protruding. They eat a wide variety of small planktonic organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, diatoms, and zooplankton, and they will also take detritus. Little is known about the diet of the lancelet larvae in the wild, but captive larvae of several species can be maintained on a diet of phytoplankton, although this apparently is not optimal for &quot;Asymmetron lucayanum&quot;.

Lancelets have oral cirri, thin tentacle-like strands that hang in front of the mouth and act as sensory devices and as a filter for the water passing into the body. Water passes from the mouth into the large pharynx, which is lined by numerous gill-slits. The ventral surface of the pharynx contains a groove called the endostyle, which, connected to a structure known as Hatschek&#x27;s pit, produces a film of mucus. Ciliary action pushes the mucus in a film over the surface of the gill slits, trapping suspended food particles as it does so. The mucus is collected in a second, dorsal groove, known as the epipharyngeal groove, and passed back to the rest of the digestive tract. Having passed through the gill slits, the water enters an atrium surrounding the pharynx, then exits the body via the atriopore.

Both adults and larvae exhibit a &quot;cough&quot; reflex to clear the mouth or throat of debris or items too large to swallow. In larvae the action is mediated by the pharyngeal muscles while in the adult animal it is accomplished by atrial contraction.

The remainder of the digestive system consists of a simple tube running from the pharynx to the anus. The hepatic caecum, a single blind-ending caecum, branches off from the underside of the gut, with a lining able to phagocytize the food particles, a feature not found in vertebrates. Although it performs many functions of a liver, it is not considered a true liver but a homolog of the vertebrate liver.

=== Other systems ===
Lancelets have no respiratory system, breathing solely through their skin, which consists of a simple epithelium. Despite the name, little if any respiration occurs in the &quot;gill&quot; slits, which are solely devoted to feeding. The circulatory system does resemble that of primitive fish in its general layout, but is much simpler, and does not include a heart. There are no blood cells, and no hemoglobin.

The excretory system consists of segmented &quot;kidneys&quot; containing protonephridia instead of nephrons, and quite unlike those of vertebrates. Also unlike vertebrates, there are numerous, segmented gonads.

== Model organism ==
Lancelets became famous in the 1860s when Ernst Haeckel began promoting them as a model for the ancestor of all vertebrates. By 1900, lancelets had become a model organism. By the mid-20th century they had fallen out of favor for a variety of reasons, including a decline of comparative anatomy and embryology, and due to the belief that lancelets were more derived than they appeared, e.g., the profound asymmetry in the larval stage. More recently, the fundamental symmetric and twisted development of vertebrates is the topic of the axial twist theory. According to this theory, there is a deep agreement between the vertebrates and cephalochordates, and even all chordates.

With the advent of molecular genetics lancelets are once again regarded as a model of vertebrate ancestors, and are used again as a model organism.

As a result of their use in science, methods of keeping and breeding lancelets in captivity have been developed for several of the species, initially the European &quot;Branchiostoma lanceolatum&quot;, but later also the West Pacific &quot;Branchiostoma belcheri&quot; and &quot;Branchiostoma japonicum&quot;, the Gulf of Mexico and West Atlantic &quot;Branchiostoma floridae&quot; and the circumtropical (however, genetic evidence suggest the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations should be recognized as separate) &quot;Asymmetron lucayanum&quot;. They can reach an age of up to 7–8 years.

==As human food==
The animals are edible and harvested in some parts of the world. They are eaten both fresh, tasting like herring, and as a food additive in dry form after being roasted in oil. When their gonads start to ripen in the spring it affects their flavor, making them taste bad during their breeding season.

== Phylogeny and taxonomy ==
The lancelets were traditionally seen as the sister lineage to the vertebrates; in turn, these two groups together (sometimes called Notochordata) were considered the sister group to the Tunicata (also called Urochordata and including sea squirts). Consistent with this view, at least ten morphological features are shared by lancelets and vertebrates, but not tunicates. Newer research suggests this pattern of evolutionary relationship is incorrect. Extensive molecular phylogenetic analysis has shown convincingly that the Cephalochordata is the most basal subphylum of the chordates, with tunicates being the sister group of the vertebrates. This revised phylogeny of chordates suggests that tunicates have secondarily lost some of the morphological characters that were formerly considered to be synapomorphies (shared, derived characters) of vertebrates and lancelets. Lancelets have turned out to be among the most genetically diverse animals sequenced to date, due to high rates of genetic changes like exon shuffling and domain combination.

Among the three extant (living) genera, &quot;Asymmetron&quot; is basal. Molecular clock studies have come to different conclusions on their divergence, with some suggesting that &quot;Asymmetron&quot; diverged from other lancelets more than 100 million years ago while others have suggested that it occurred about 46 million years ago. According to the younger estimation, &quot;Branchiostoma&quot; and &quot;Epigonichthys&quot; have been estimated to have diverged from each other about 38.3 million years ago. Despite this deep separation, hybrids between &quot;Asymmetron lucayanum&quot; and &quot;Branchiostoma floridae&quot; are viable (among the deepest split species known to be able to produce such hybrids).

The following are the species recognised by WoRMS. Other sources recognize about thirty species. It is likely that currently unrecognized cryptic species remain.

<text>Heart Hampshire (formerly Ocean FM and Ocean Sound) is a British Independent Local Radio station serving South Hampshire, West Sussex (excluding Worthing) and The Isle of Wight primarily for Portsmouth, Southampton, Winchester and Chichester. The station serves an area of England with a high proportion of commuters to London and a higher-than-average disposable income from middle-class families and people over 45. Its target age range is 25–45.

==History==

Ocean Sound&#x27;s predecessor, Radio Victory provided the first local commercial radio service in the South of England in 1975, with its small transmission area around Portsmouth. The station was disliked by the then regulator the Independent Broadcasting Authority, and when it re-advertised the Portsmouth licence to include Southampton and Winchester, Victory lost out to a new consortium called &quot;Ocean Sound Ltd&quot;. Ocean Sound proposed an expanded coverage area taking in Southampton. Radio Victory ceased operations in June 1986, three months earlier than the expiry date of its franchise, with a test transmission informing listeners of the unprecedented situation. Ocean Sound took over programme provision that October from a new purpose-built broadcast unit in a business park at Segensworth West on the western outskirts of Fareham, Hampshire.

Ocean Sound debuted on 12 October 1986, initially with two services – Ocean Sound (West), covering Southampton, Winchester and much of the Isle of Wight, and Ocean Sound (East) serving Portsmouth and the surrounding area. Ocean Sound (West) used 103.2 MHz FM and 1557 kHz AM. Ocean Sound (East) used 97.5 MHz FM and 1170 kHz AM. The East service underwent a change of frequency from that inherited from Radio Victory (from 95.0 MHz to 97.5 MHz FM). Both services shared breakfast and evening programmes with daytime output and specialist programmes broadcasting uniquely on each service – for instance on Saturday evenings, an Isle of Wight programme with Jean-Paul Hansford would air on Ocean Sound (West)&#x27;s FM frequency, while an alternative, Guy Hornsby&#x27;s Saturday Soul Club would air on Ocean Sound (East) and the AM transmitter of Ocean Sound (West). This was prior to the termination of simulcasting programmes on FM and AM, which would see both services transformed.

The reason that two stations launched, rather than an expanded solo station is that then managing director David Lucas identified two potential audiences: one familiar with commercial radio (in the East area), and one largely acquainted with the BBC (the West area, of which the majority of local listening was to BBC Radio Solent). Ocean Sound (East) therefore sounded livelier than its West counterpart, which took on a softer sound.

===New Studios===

Once the franchise was won, Ocean Sound needed brand-new state of the art studios in Segensworth West, a district outside Fareham, beside the M27 motorway in Hampshire. This move to base themselves outside the two major cities of Southampton and Portsmouth was a strategic one, so as not to appear sounding biased in favour of either city and to remove any lingering associations with Radio Victory, primarily focused on Portsmouth.

The following is an excerpt of a 1986 interview with then managing director David Lucas in an Independent Broadcasting Authority publication:

&quot;The original plan was to have studio buildings and offices in both Portsmouth and Southampton,&#x27; says Lucas. &#x27;But that is an unnecessarily complicated way of doing the job. The important thing is for the programmes themselves to provide a strong and relevant local identity. Contribution studios have been established in both Portsmouth and Southampton to provide direct city-centre access to the airwaves for interviewees and guests.&quot;

&quot;&quot;...But Lucas, like some other radio managers, wonders whether the high standards of IBA studio specifications are always necessary. &#x27;A significant proportion of studio costs comes in sound-proofing them&#x27;; says Lucas. &#x27;Would it really matter if the listener heard the occasional lorry rumbling past outside? With most stations operating on close mic techniques anyway, peripheral noise can be minor&#x27;&quot;.&quot;

Once the studios were complete, staff needed to be hired – almost from scratch. Sales managers and a Head of News were all recruited, ironically from Radio Victory. Construction of the new studios took under a year and finished in time for the station&#x27;s launch in 1986.

On 6 December 1987, Ocean Sound&#x27;s coverage area was extended with an additional service covering the Winchester area. Entitled &quot;Ocean Sound (North)&quot; – The Light FM, this would relay the Ocean Sound West service, with locally focused news, travel and programmes during the morning, early afternoon and early evening. Ocean Sound North could be heard on 96.7 MHz FM.

===The Gold, The Power and The Light===

1988 saw Ocean Sound undergo a massive re-organisation of its frequencies and services. The main changes were:

*&quot;Ocean Sound (East and North)&quot; on FM would become FM-only and simply renamed Ocean Sound and The Light FM
*&quot;Ocean Sound (West)&quot; on FM would become Power FM
*&quot;Ocean Sound&quot; on AM would become The Gold AM

The Gold AM launched on its mediumwave transmitters, effectively permanently separating from its FM counterpart. An all-oldies format playing 1960s and 1970s pop music, it won the right to use the name after a court battle with County Sound, a station originating from Guildford, Surrey, selected &quot;County Sound GOLD&quot;, later resulting in the Surrey station adopting its &quot;First Gold Radio&quot; moniker. 
Ocean Sound and The Light FM continued as before on 97.5 and 96.7 MHz FM, whilst Ocean Sound (West) relaunched as a music-intensive youth pop station – 103.2 Power FM on 4 December 1988. Power FM was designed as a direct competitor to BBC Radio 1 in the area, with a heavy rotation of chart and Top 40 pop and mainstream dance, with quick hourly news and information. It aimed to win over Radio 1 listeners who were frustrated by the fact that the BBC station would remain on mediumwave only in the area until May 1990, despite the fact that in the autumn of 1988 it was regularly plugging its new FM transmitters, sometimes giving the impression that it could already be heard on FM throughout the UK. The services were, however, 24 hours a day and overnights were a single programme with the DJ not identifying the service and separate jingles playing to the correct transmitter to give the impression that the listener was still tuned to the service for that frequency.

===Mergers, takeovers and relaunches===

Sussex radio station Southern Sound looked upon Ocean Sound as a potential takeover target, citing its location in a prosperous and commercially attractive area of England. So in 1992 a merger was agreed forming Southern Radio Holdings plc, which would see the following further changes to Ocean Sound:

*&quot;Ocean Sound&quot; and &quot;The Light FM&quot; would unite as Ocean Sound – Classic Hits (later abbreviated just to Ocean FM)
*Power FM would continue as before
*&quot;The Gold AM&quot; would merge with Southern Sound&#x27;s AM frequencies to create South Coast Radio.

Ocean FM was reduced to an opt-out service from the main Sussex station, sharing output for most of the day with local news every half-hour at breakfast and drivetime. South Coast Radio would take on a much more relaxed sound with the slogan &quot;Light and Easy&quot;, playing mostly Easy Listening and soft Gold hits.

In 1994, Capital Radio, looking for expansion possibilities, opted to purchase Southern Radio plc, which included Ocean Sound, now renamed Ocean FM. This led to more changes, this time to the on-air sound rather than name changes. Whilst Power FM took on Capital FM&#x27;s long-established, successful and highly polished sound, Ocean FM became a more music-led station, playing heavy rotation soft adult contemporary hits, with its news and information sequences reduced in length and finishing with the sentence &quot;And that&#x27;s the way it is at [time check]&quot;.

In 1997, the Capital Radio Group along with the GWR Group sought Radio Authority approval to reduce the amount of local programming on its AM stations, affecting South Coast Radio. This would mean the station would be opting-out of a main service based in London. There Capital Gold was launched in place of South Coast Radio, with four hours programming locally produced, usually either at breakfast or drivetime.

In 1998, Ocean FM was a key target for newly launched Wave 105, a similar-sounding commercial radio station also playing adult contemporary music. Launched by former &quot;Ocean Sound&quot; managing director David Lucas, Wave 105 would curiously base itself in Segensworth East, a few hundred metres away from Ocean FM in Segensworth West.

Meanwhile, Ocean FM would be part of a network of AC stations, including Invicta FM and Fox FM. In 2000, this was re-organised to be part of the Century FM network, playing current AC music with a slogan of &quot;Number 1 for 80s, 90s and Now!&quot;

===Ocean in the 2000s===

With fiercely loyal listenership to BBC Radio Solent, direct competition from Original 106, Wave 105 and BBC Radio 2, Dream 107.2, Radio Hampshire (formerly SouthCity FM &amp; The Saint) and a failed revival of Radio Victory (later 107.4 The Quay), Ocean was still a well-known brand and regularly featured among the better-performing local music stations. It was such a strong name that GCap Media bosses refused to re-brand the station as Century FM along usual radio network lines, and the station only broadcast special network shows.

Ocean went digital in 2003, airing on DAB digital radio in South Hampshire, West Sussex and the Isle of Wight, along with sister stations Power FM and Capital Gold; competitors Wave 105, The Saint, BBC Radio Solent; and new stations Capital Disney and XFM.

In May 2006, Ocean dropped the &#x27;FM&#x27; from its previous &#x27;Ocean FM&#x27; name to become just &#x27;Ocean&#x27;, simultaneously introducing a new set of logos and the tagline &quot;Hampshire&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. In June 2007 the use of &#x27;Ocean FM&#x27; was introduced back into the output in addition to a new tagline &quot;Classic Hits and the Best New Songs&quot;. However the website still used the Hampshire&#x27;s Greatest Hits tag. Around the same time, Ocean did not renew the contracts of long term Presenters Richard Williams, Pippa Head, James Macdonald and Australian import Warren Kay and more automation and networking was implemented.

Ocean also had their own charity, Help a Local Child. It launched in 2003 with a commitment to helping local children and young people up to the age of 18, who experience the negative effects of poverty, abuse, neglect, homelessness, violence, crime, illness and disability in the area. They frequently held fund raising events from car boot sales to themed discos with competitions.

===Heart rebranding===
In 2008, it was announced that Ocean FM, along with 30 other stations in the One Network, would be rebranded Heart by owners Global Radio. Ocean FM was amongst the final phase of stations to be rebranded, becoming Heart Hampshire on 22 June 2009.

===Network restructuring===
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to merge Heart Hampshire with Heart Dorset &amp; New Forest as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new station, &quot;Heart South Coast&quot;, began broadcasting from Fareham on 30 July 2010.

<text>Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt (11 May 181112 March 1888) was an English vice-admiral, hydrographer, and geologist.
== Life ==

Thomas Spratt was born at Woodway House, East Teignmouth, the eldest son of Commander James Spratt, RN, who was a hero of the Battle of Trafalgar. He joined the Royal Navy at age 16 in 1827 and was attached to the surveying branch on HMS &quot;Victory&quot;. He was engaged almost continuously until 1863 in surveying the Mediterranean. He received his early training in surveying from Thomas Graves in HMS &quot;Mastiff&quot; and . He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1841 and his first command was the converted sixth-rate . He then succeeded Graves as commander of HMS &quot;Spitfire&quot;. He rendered distinguished service in the Black Sea during the Crimean War, planning the attacks on Kertch and Kinburn. He was promoted to captain in 1855, and was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in the same year. He was then given command of in which ship he continued survey work in the Mediterranean.

At an earlier date he was associated with Edward Forbes, then naturalist to the &quot;Beacon&quot;, and during the years 1841–1843 they made observations on the bathymetric distribution of marine life. He was specially indebted to Forbes for his interest in natural history and geology, and together they published &quot;Travels in Lycia&quot;, etc. (1847). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as &quot;The author of Travels in Lycia, &amp; Important papers in the Journals of the Geological &amp; Geographical Societies&quot;.

Whilst on sick leave in Teignmouth due to the after effects of malaria he investigated the movements of the Sand Bars at Teignmouth and suggested practical means of improving the entrance to the harbour. He published his research in 1856 and was congratulated for the clarity and practicality of his work by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who was building the South Devon Railway at the time.

Spratt investigated the caves at Malta and obtained remains of the pygmy elephant (&quot;Elephas melitensis&quot;), which was described by Hugh Falconer. He investigated the geology of several Greek islands, the shores of Asia Minor, and the Nile delta.

He was especially distinguished for his &quot;Travels and Researches in Crete&quot; (2 vols., 1865), in which he described the physical geography, geology, archaeology (Eleutherna Bridge) and natural history of the island. Two fossil species were named in his honour and several books were dedicated to him. He was commissioner of fisheries from 1866 to 1873; and acting conservator of the River Mersey from 1879 until his death at Tunbridge Wells on 12 March 1888.

He had married Sophia Price. Two sons died young. Sidney Drake died in Malta (23 December 1852) at the age of 21 months and was buried at the Msida Bastion Historic Garden, in Floriana. A gravestone is still existing. On the same stone is also mentioned William Devereux who died in the island of Crete (12 November 1852) at the age of 3 years and 6 months.

==Role in discovery of Troy==
One of the maps made by Thomas Spratt known as &quot;Spratt&#x27;s Map&quot; was used by archaeologists Heinrich Schliemann, Wilhelm Dorpfeld, and Carl Blegen, which contributed to the discovery of Troy, because the name &quot;Troy&quot; with a question mark was added by a German professor of classical antiquities working with Spratt over the spot of the real Troy. He had added it, because it was above the ruins of the identified Greek city of &quot;Novo Ilium&quot; (New Troy). Observing the map, Schliemann saw Troy with a question mark and decided to begin digging, which led to the discovery of Troy.

<text>Charles Hutton FRS FRSE LLD (14 August 1737 – 27 January 1823) was an English mathematician and surveyor. He was professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich from 1773 to 1807. He is remembered for his calculation of the density of the earth from Nevil Maskelyne&#x27;s measurements collected during the Schiehallion experiment.

==Life==
Hutton was born on Percy Street in Newcastle upon Tyne in the north of England, the son of a superintendent of mines, who died when he was still very young. He was educated at a school at Jesmond, kept by Mr Ivison, an Anglican clergyman. There is reason to believe, on the evidence of two pay-bills, that for a short time in 1755 and 1756 Hutton worked in the colliery at Old Long Benton. Following Ivison&#x27;s promotion to a church living, Hutton took over the Jesmond school, which, in consequence of his increasing number of pupils, he relocated to nearby Stotes Hall, since demolished. While he taught during the day at Stotes Hall, which overlooked Jesmond Dene, he studied mathematics in the evening at a school in Newcastle. In 1760 he married, and began teaching on a larger scale in Newcastle, where his pupils included John Scott, later Lord Eldon, who became Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

In 1764 Hutton published his first work, &quot;The Schoolmasters Guide, or a Complete System of Practical Arithmetic&quot;, which was followed by his &quot;Treatise on Mensuration both in Theory and Practice&quot; in 1770. At around this time he was employed by the mayor and corporation of Newcastle to make a survey of the town and its environs. He drew up a map for the corporation; a smaller one, of the town only, was engraved and published. In 1772 he brought out a tract on &quot;The Principles of Bridges&quot;, a subject suggested by the destruction of the sole Newcastle bridge by the Great Flood of 1771.

Hutton left Newcastle in 1773, following his appointment as professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in July, 1774 He was asked by the society to perform the calculations necessary to work out the mass and density of the earth from the results of the Schiehallion experiment – a set of observations of the gravitational pull of a mountain in Perthshire made by the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, in 1774–76. Hutton&#x27;s results appeared in the society&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for 1778, and were later reprinted in the second volume of Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Tracts on Mathematical and Philosophical Subjects&quot;. His work on the question procured for him the degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. He became the foreign secretary of the Royal Society in 1779. His resignation from the society in 1783 was brought about by tensions between its president Sir Joseph Banks and the mathematicians amongst its members. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788.

While working on the Schiehallion experiment, Hutton recorded 23 Gaelic place-names on or near his measurement contour. Less than half are to be found on the modern Ordnance Survey map.

After his &quot;Tables of the Products and Powers of Numbers&quot;, 1781, and his &quot;Mathematical Tables&quot; of 1785 (second edition 1794), Hutton issued, for the use of the Royal Military Academy, in 1787 &quot;Elements of Conic Sections&quot;, and in 1798 his &quot;Course of Mathematics&quot;. His &quot;Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary&quot;, a valuable contribution to scientific biography, was published in 1795 and the four volumes of &quot;Recreations in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy&quot;, mostly translated from the French, in 1803. One of his most laborious works was the abridgment, in conjunction with G. Shaw and R. Pearson, of the Royal Society&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. This undertaking, the mathematical and scientific parts of which fell to Hutton, was completed in 1809, and filled 18 quarto volumes. From 1764 he contributed to &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Diary&quot; (a poetical and mathematical almanac established in 1704), and became its editor in 1773–4, retaining the post until 1817. He had previously begun a small periodical called &quot;Miscellane Mathematica&quot;, of which only 13 numbers appeared; he subsequently published five volumes of &quot;The Diarian Miscellany&quot; which contained substantial extracts from the &quot;Diary&quot;.

Due to ill health, Hutton resigned his professorship in 1807, although he served as the principal examiner of the Royal Military Academy, and also to the Addiscombe Military Seminary for some years after his retirement. The Board of Ordnance had granted him a pension of £500 a year. During his last years, he worked on new editions of his earlier works.

He died on 27 January 1823, and was buried in the family vault at Charlton, in Kent.

During the last year of his life a group of his friends set up a fund to pay to have a marble bust made of him. It was executed by the sculptor Sebastian Gahagan. The subscription exceeded the amount necessary, and a medal was also produced, engraved by Benjamin Wyon, showing Hutton&#x27;s head on one side and emblems representing his discoveries about the force of gunpowder, and the density of the earth on the other.

<doc id="938018" wikidata="Q5692090" url="?curid=938018" title="Heart Somerset">
<text>Heart Somerset (formerly Somerset&#x27;s Orchard FM) was an Independent Local Radio station serving Somerset, England. Originally owned by (and officially remains licensed to) Orchard Media Ltd, the company was purchased by GWR Group in 1999, and subsequently became owned by GCap Media in 2005. Somerset&#x27;s Orchard FM (later Heart Somerset) broadcast from studios at Haygrove House (a converted farmhouse and grounds) at Shoreditch near Taunton Racecourse, Taunton, adjacent to the M5.

==History==
In November 2005 it was announced that GCap&#x27;s local radio stations in the South West, including Orchard FM, were to be sold. This is because they were outside of the company&#x27;s primary target area. This sale was called off in Spring 2006 because the bids received were much lower than hoped.

2008 saw the takeover of GCap Media by Global Radio. On 20 January 2009, it was announced that Orchard FM, along with 11 other stations in Southern England, would be rebranded as Heart on 23 March 2009.

Presenters on the station over the years included Bob McCreadie (later Pirate FM and Radio Plymouth), Phil Easton, Steve Bulley (now at Wessex FM), Jennie Gow (now presenter of MotoGP for the BBC), Steve Carpenter (now Radio Ninesprings), Jon White (now The Breeze), Mike Harwood, Dave Hills, Dan Jennings, Alex James (Alex Breingan), Tim Ley, Gregory Steven&#x27;s, Dave Gould, Robert D&#x27;Ovidio (now Capital 95.8), Jeremy Kyle, Ian Burrage, Laura James (now The Breeze), Matt Bown (later BBC Southwest) and Ben Clark. Newsreaders included Rachel Hart, Lindsey Ashwood, Dominic Cotter (now BBC Radio Oxford), Greg Bown (now Radio Ninesprings), Angus Walker, Nicola Maxey, Darren Bevan, Helen Martin and Lisa Hay (later BBC Southwest, Mike Marsh. 
Black Thunder was the name given to Orchard FM&#x27;s promotional team and their heavily branded 4x4 vehicles based at the Taunton studios, staffed by presenters including Laura James and Matt Bown along with promotional staff Becci Balliston, Matt Burd, Jodi Peppin, Becky Rayfield, Jemma Crook and thunder biker Simon Clark.

==Network restructuring==
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart Somerset and merge the station with Heart Bristol and Heart Bath as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The final local programme was broadcast on Friday 16 July 2010 by long-standing breakfast presenters Ian Burrage and Laura James. The new station, &quot;Heart West Country&quot;, began broadcasting from Bristol on the same date.

==Transmitters==
The main frequency is on 102.6 MHz FM from the Mendip TV Mast. This is at 4 kW, mixed polarisation. The signal is highly directional, with the maximum ERP only being radiated to the south and into Somerset in order to prevent a coverage and thus programming overlap with Heart from Bristol.

Other frequencies are 97.1 MHz FM from Chedington (near Crewkerne), which is at 400 watts, but again directional in order to prevent interference with nearby Wessex FM from the Dorchester area, which broadcasts on 97.2 MHz FM. This transmitter exists to reinforce coverage in the Yeovil, North Dorset and South Somerset areas.

96.5 MHz FM radiates from a 60 watt transmitter located in the grounds of the converted farm at Shoreditch in Taunton, from which Orchard FM and Heart Somerset were based. This transmitter reinforces signal in the Taunton area.

==Background==
The station was launched in 1992 under the name of Pirate FM 102 with the voice of breakfast presenter Roger Day (a well-known ex-pirate DJ from Radio Caroline and Radio North Sea International). The station&#x27;s launch Chief Executive was Mike Powell, who specified digital technology so advanced at the time that it was featured on the BBC science programme, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;.

Much of the early success of the station was due to the technical expertise of the first managing director Richard Lawley, who was also a graduate electronic engineer. He was succeeded by the station&#x27;s initial sales director Joseph Swain. The station has also won numerous awards including &#x27;Station of the Year&#x27; (in the 300,000 to 1 million potential audience category) at the 2003 and 2006 Sony Radio Academy awards.

In September 2005, the station&#x27;s branding changed from &quot;The Southwest&#x27;s Pirate FM&quot; to &quot;Cornwall&#x27;s Pirate FM&quot;. Listenership appears to have increased in Cornwall following the move, however it reduced their audience in West Devon (including Plymouth, where Pirate FM had a separate office and studio prior to the rebrand). From &quot;Quarter 4&quot; 2006 Pirate FM&#x27;s survey area (TSA) was reduced by removing Plymouth &amp; most of West Devon, thus reducing the potential audience significantly but focusing on the core Cornish audience. Pirate FM remains as the number one station by audience reach despite the increased competition.

The Pirate Trust was the charitable arm of Pirate FM that raises thousands of pounds yearly for good causes in Cornwall with their &#x27;Cornwall in Need Appeal&#x27;. Yearly fundraisers include the &#x27;Garden Party&#x27; and the all-day on-air and online auction known as &#x27;Radiothon&#x27;. Radiothon [2007] and Radiothon [2008] were both run in collaboration with free classifieds website itsmymarket.com

Almost all programming is produced and presented locally. From August 2014 until 2020, the station operated a second service on DAB, known as Pirate 2, which aired a series of weekly specialist talk shows, covering topics such as business, farming, education and health and wellbeing.

Until 2018, Pirate FM broadcast &quot;The Vodafone Big Top 40&quot; chart show (previously The Pepsi Chart &amp; Hit40UK) which was produced from Capital FM in London and syndicated across over 140 commercial radio stations in the UK. However, the show was withdrawn from syndication in 2018 and now broadcasts solely on Heart &amp; Capital stations. The &#x27;Hits UK&#x27; show is now presented on the station with Sam Thompson.

In February 2021, the station, along with Lincs FM, began syndicating the UK Chart Show, from Bauer&#x27;s Hits Radio network, on Sunday afternoons. In recent years, the station has also shared a music playlist and many features with Hampshire-based sister station Wave 105.

==Station restructuring and rebrand==
On 27 February 2024, station owners Bauer announced Pirate FM would be rebranded as Hits Radio Cornwall from 17 April 2024, as part of a wider relaunch involving 17 local radio stations in England and Wales.

The station would be available on DAB and online only and most of the station&#x27;s local programming outside weekday breakfast will be replaced with programming from the Hits Radio Network, although local news, traffic bulletins and advertising will be retained.

Pirate&#x27;s FM frequencies were taken over by a local variant of Greatest Hits Radio, which will include a local afternoon show for Cornwall, local news and traffic bulletins, alongside a largely networked schedule featuring weekday shows with Ken Bruce and Simon Mayo.

The changes were expected to lead to a number of redundancies with freelance contracts being placed under review.

It was later announced that Pirate presenters Scott Temple and Holly Day would host Greatest Hits Radio&#x27;s local afternoon show.

== Programming ==
Local programming airs 6-10am on weekdays from Bauer’s Redruth studios.

At all other times networked programming airs via Bauer’s London headquarters or from studios in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle.

== Former Presenters ==

* Scott Temple (now stand-in)
* Holly Day

==News==
Bauer&#x27;s Redruth newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am-7pm on weekdays, and from 7am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked bulletins on weekend afternoons, usually originating from Bauer&#x27;s Manchester newsroom.

==Branding==
Hits Radio Cornwall has one current on air strapline: &quot;The Biggest Hits, The Biggest Throwbacks&quot;

005, made by jingle production company IQ Beats. It was a re-recording of a previous package made for Heart 106.2 in London.

Previous Pirate FM (Former name of Hits Radio Cornwall) straplines were &quot;&quot;More music for Cornwall&quot;, &quot;Real music variety&quot;, &quot;Better variety, more music&quot;, &quot;The world&#x27;s greatest music&quot;, &quot;Greatest memories, latest hits&quot;, &quot;Love Cornwall, Love Music, Love Pirate FM&quot; and &quot;The latest technology, and the best records too&quot;&quot;.

Pirate FM adopted the Hits Radio Network slogan &#x27;The Biggest Hits, The Biggest Throwbacks&#x27; in 2023, alongside &#x27;Love Cornwall, Love Music&#x27;.

==Mascot==
Intermittently since 1992, the station employed a mascot that accompanies the broadcast team to events.

From launch until the early 2000s, the character was known as &quot;Jasper Parrot&quot;, while in recent years, Pirate revisited the concept with a parrot character, named &quot;Dreckly&quot; after an audience vote.

==Expansion==
Pirate FM was one of the two stations that applied for the licence to serve Plymouth after the licence was handed back by Macquarie&#x27;s Diamond FM.

The UKRD plan to extend Pirate&#x27;s service under the name Plymouth&#x27;s Pirate FM lost out to Radio Plymouth, which was also eventually acquired by Bauer Media Audio UK and merged with the Greatest Hits Radio network in its FM slots and the Hits Radio network on its former DAB slot.

<text>Heart Northants (formerly Northants 96) was an Independent Local Radio station serving Northamptonshire.

The station broadcast on 96.6 FM from studios in Northampton town centre, via the transmitter located in the Kingsthorpe area. As of August 2011 the station merged with Heart Dunstable and Heart Bedford to become [[Heart Four Counties]] and now has its studios from Central Milton Keynes. It is owned and operated by Global Radio as a part of the Heart Network.

== History ==

=== The start of commercial local radio in Northamptonshire ===
Hereward Radio was the first Independent Local Radio franchise for the county, providing programmes for Northamptonshire, Milton Keynes and Rugby from 1 October 1984, using its former FM frequency of 102.8 MHz and 1557 kHz medium wave. The station launched at 1am, while disc jockey John Warwick hosted its morning show, &quot;Hereward Daybreak&quot; the following morning.

Local radio frequencies on the FM band in the United Kingdom were expanded and re-organised to form &#x27;sub-bands&#x27; (104–105 MHz were reserved for BBC Local Radio, whereas 96.1–97.7 MHz were attributed to Independent Local Radio). This affected Northamptonshire as follows:

*BBC Radio Northampton (96.6 FM) moved to 104.2 FM and 103.6 FM
*Northamptonshire ILR (102.8 FM) moved to 96.6 FM.

Shortly afterwards, due to general difficulties within the commercial radio industry at the time Hereward withdrew from Northamptonshire and continued in Peterborough. In 1985, the Independent Broadcasting Authority assigned the Independent Local Radio franchise to a new company, Northants Radio Ltd, owned by Chiltern Radio Group.

Northants 96 launched at 10.00 am on 30 November 1986 with announcer Tony West introducing the first regular programmes on the station. Following a synthesised alarm clock ticking saying: &quot;Good Morning. 10am, Sunday 30 November 1986, and this is the new sound of radio in Northamptonshire- Northants 96!&quot; followed by a station identification jingle and a welcome message from the then Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire and the first song to be played was &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; by The Beach Boys.

Notable disc jockeys on Northants included Northants&#x27; first breakfast show, future well-known hypnotist Paul McKenna and David Prever, who would later move to Wiltshire&#x27;s GWR FM

Its to be noted that Northants 96 and Northants Radio were interchangeable names for the station and relayed programmes on a mediumwave frequency – 1557 kHz, which opened on 25 June 1990.

===The Hot FM and SuperGold===
Northants 96 was essentially part of a regional collective of commercial stations which included Chiltern Radio, based in Dunstable and Bedford. Station directors had to tackle a major concern in the area; &quot;how do you make this station appear more &#x27;local&#x27; than the previous incumbent, while saving money at the same time?&quot; The result was that programmes were syndicated from Chiltern headquarters in Dunstable during the day, consisting of popular middle of the road music whilst &#x27;opting out&#x27; for hourly local news bulletins. Thus &quot;The Hot FM&quot; sustaining service was born.

The Chiltern Radio Group did this by making use of new technology whereby a disc-jockey interjects with an identification jingle during a networked/syndicated programme by pressing a button with the result that depending on where the listener was, either &quot;Northants 96- The Hot FM&quot; or &quot;Chiltern Radio 97 – The Hot FM&quot; was heard. This solved the problem of inexpensive local radio with the added benefit of totally opting out of the network for local emergencies, for example snow reports or flooding information. However, after a time, some shows such as breakfast, mid morning and drive time were localised with each Chiltern Network station broadcasting individual shows.

In 1988, the Home Office declared that the independent local radio industry was able to support a permanent split in AM-FM broadcasting and decided to enforce this rule through the IBA. All ILR stations were required to broadcast separate programming or lose their licences. The Chiltern Radio Network responded to this by launching its second sustaining service, SuperGold, on 15 July 1990. SuperGold was a general golden oldies station broadcasting to Herts, Beds, Bucks and Cambridge on the medium wave band with Northants Radio SuperGold following suit. Both the classic and contemporary FM and the oldies AM stations were rated very highly, consistently beating its local competitor BBC Radio Northampton.

=== A better music mix, a hostile takeover ===
The Chiltern Radio Group, then a plc received a hostile takeover bid from GWR Group plc in 1995 which was reluctantly accepted. This affected both FM and AM stations and networked programming- &quot;The Hot FM&quot; closed and associated stations were rebranded &quot;The New______- A Better Music Mix&quot; while &quot;SuperGold&quot; was absorbed into GWR Group&#x27;s existing Classic Gold network.

Northants Radio however was less affected by this major change than other stations in the enlarged group (Chiltern Radio for example) becoming &quot;The New Northants 96&quot; whereas its AM station &quot;Northants Radio SuperGold&quot; became &quot;Classic Gold 1557&quot;. The significance of this takeover was more resources meant a more local service; up to 15 hours a day were broadcast locally on FM as opposed to a mere 4 under &quot;The Hot FM&quot; whilst Classic Gold retained 8 hours.

Programming-wise Northants Radio underwent a subtle shift towards more upbeat contemporary and chart hits and less in the way of talk. A past slogan voiced by Eddy Temple-Morris claimed that &quot;other radio stations talked over the end of songs, whilst we didn&#x27;t- That&#x27;s the Northants 96 difference&quot;. This over time evolved into the &quot;Better Music Mix of the 80s 90s and today&quot; and &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Mix for Northamptonshire&quot;.

Shortly after Northants&#x27; former owner GWR Group merged with Capital Radio plc to form GCap Media in 2005, Northants 96 adopted the slogan &quot;More music variety&quot;. In 2008, GCap Media&#x27;s radio and music assets were purchased by Global Radio.

===More music variety arrives===
On 5 January 2009, Northants 96 was rebranded Heart, along with Dunstable-based Chiltern Radio and other Global-owned stations in the East of England. Heart Northamptonshire reduced its weekday local output from 12 hours to seven.

On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart Northants and merge the station with Heart Milton Keynes, Heart Dunstable and Heart Bedford as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new station, &quot;Heart Home Counties&quot; (later Heart Four Counties), began broadcasting from Dunstable on 16 July 2010. Networked and local programming on the merged station are now similar, except for commercial breaks, which are still split locally. Heart&#x27;s Northampton base in the town centre were closed as early as March 2011, with the station expected to be broadcast from new premises in Milton Keynes.

<text>Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire is an Independent Local Radio station based in Birmingham, England, owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to Coventry and Warwickshire.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 107,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==

The station began broadcasting as Mercia Sound at 0700 BST on 23 May 1980, with an opening announcement by Programme Director Ian Rufus, followed by breakfast presenter Gordon Astley and a news bulletin read by Mike Henfield.

In 1987, the station moved FM frequencies, along with most ILR stations at the time to 97.0 FM. Shortly after this a new transmitter on 102.9 FM was created to serve South Warwickshire.

In 1989, along with BRMB in Birmingham, the AM frequency was split from the FM transmissions to create a new radio station called Xtra AM which played music from the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1993, the station&#x27;s owners, Midlands Radio, sold the station to Capital Radio who, shortly afterwards sold it to GWR Group, who re-branded it in-line with their &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Mix&quot; slogan from 1994 onwards. During this period numerous presenters from other GWR stations joined Mercia, including Craig Strong (Trent FM, Ram FM, Leicester Sound), Tim Gough (Trent FM, dead in 2022), Adrian Eyre (Trent FM, Ram FM), Rachael Hopper (Ram FM) and Sean Goldsmith (Trent FM). From 2002 onwards, the slogan was &quot;Playing the best mix of the 80&#x27;s, 90&#x27;s and today&quot;. In 2007, it reverted to the old slogan of &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Mix&quot;.

On 8 August 2008, it was confirmed that due to competition &#x27;conflict of interests&#x27; in the West Midlands (and in other areas), Mercia would be sold by Global Radio, along with other West Midlands owned GCap/Global stations BRMB, Wyvern FM, Heart 106 and Beacon Radio. In July 2009, the station was sold officially to a company, backed by Lloyds Development Capital and Phil Riley, called Orion Media.

At this time, seven hours of local programming were broadcast each weekday with four hours on weekend afternoons and a regional daytime programme on weekdays.

On 8 July 2011, Orion Media announced plans to close Mercia&#x27;s studios at Hertford Place in Coventry and co-locate the station to the company&#x27;s headquarters in Birmingham – the move took place two months later and the Hertford Place studios were transferred to community radio station Radio Plus.

On 9 January 2012, Orion Media announced that Mercia would be rebranded as a Free Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire from April 2012, along with its sister West Midlands stations Beacon, BRMB and Wyvern. The Mercia brand was phased out on Wednesday 21 March 2012 in preparation for the rebrand, which took place at 7pm on Monday 26 March 2012.

On 6 May 2016, the station&#x27;s owners, Orion, announced they had been brought by Bauer for an undisclosed fee, reportedly between £40 and £50 million.

In May 2019, following OFCOM&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Bauer announced Free Radio&#x27;s Coventry &amp; Warwickshire breakfast show would be shared with the sister station in Herefordshire and Worcestershire from 8 July 2019, presented by John Dalziel and Roisin McCourt. The localised weekday drivetime shows were initially replaced by a single regional show, presented by Andy Goulding.

Regional weekend afternoon shows were axed in favour of additional network programming. As of 2 September 2019, further networked output replaced the weekday drivetime show.

On 23 November 2021, Bauer announced the station&#x27;s &quot;Hits at Breakfast&quot; show, presented by John Dalziel and Roisin McCourt, would broadcast across all four Free Radio licences.

The move was permitted under OFCOM&#x27;s local content guidelines. The Coventry and Warwickshire station retains opt-outs for local news, traffic updates and advertising.

===Hits Radio rebrand===
On 10 January 2024, station owners Bauer announced Free Radio would be rebranded as Hits Radio Coventry and Warwickshire from April 17th 2024, as part of a network-wide relaunch involving 17 local radio stations in England and Wales.

<doc id="938031" wikidata="Q5139519" url="?curid=938031" title="Cock rock">
<text>Cock rock is a description of rock music that emphasizes an aggressive form of male sexuality. The style developed in the later 1950s, came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, and continues into the present day.

== Characteristics ==
Cock rock is a musical genre. Philip Auslander uses Simon Frith&#x27;s description of cock rock characteristics:
[C]ock-rock performance means an explicit, crude, &#x27;masterful&#x27; expression of sexuality ... Cock-rock performers are aggressive, boastful, constantly drawing audience attention to their prowess and control. Their bodies are on display ... mikes and guitars are phallic symbols (or else caressed like female bodies), the music is loud, rhythmically insistent, built around techniques of arousal and release. Lyrics are assertive and arrogant, but the exact words are less significant than the vocal styles involved, the shrill shouting and screaming.

== Use of the term ==
The meaning of the term &quot;cock rock&quot; has changed over time. It was first mentioned by an anonymous author in the New York–based underground feminist publication &quot;Rat&quot; in 1970 to describe the male-dominated music industry, and became a synonym for hard rock, emphasizing the aggressive expression of male sexuality, often misogynist lyrics and use of phallic imagery. The term was used by sociologists Simon Frith and Angela McRobbie in 1978 to point to the contrast between the male-dominated subculture of cock rock which was &quot;aggressive, dominating and boastful&quot; and the more feminized teenybop stars of pop music. Led Zeppelin have been described as &quot;the quintessential purveyors of &#x27;cock rock&#x27;&quot;. Other formative acts include the Rolling Stones, The Who and Jim Morrison of The Doors.

In 1981, Frith described the characteristics of cock rock in a way that could apply to female performers, not just male ones. In 2004, Auslander used this description of cock-rock characteristics to show that Suzi Quatro (the first female bass player to become a major rockstar) is a female cock-rocker.

Since the 1980s, the term has been sometimes interchangeable with hair metal or glam metal. Examples of this genre include: Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Warrant, Extreme, Cinderella, Pretty Boy Floyd, Jackyl, L.A. Guns, and Poison. Despite the name, many of these bands had or have large numbers of female fans. The spoof documentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; is an acclaimed parody of the genre. In the 21st century, there was a revival of the genre with the sleaze metal movement in Sweden, with acts including Vains of Jenna.

<doc id="938033" wikidata="Q6551318" url="?curid=938033" title="Hits Radio Lincolnshire">
<text>Hits Radio Lincolnshire is an Independent Local Radio station serving Lincolnshire and Newark in Nottinghamshire. The station is owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio Network. The station has rebranded from its original name Lincs FM on 17 April 2024.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 99,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==Background==
Lincs FM commenced broadcasting from studios at Witham Park in Lincoln on 1 March 1992. It was part of the wider Lincs FM Group of eight radio stations.

In March 2019, it was announced that the radio station and its sister stations had been bought by Bauer Media for an undisclosed sum.

==Programming==
Most output is produced locally at the station&#x27;s Lincoln studios.

From February 2021, the station began to relay Bauer&#x27;s networked Sunday afternoon programme The UK Chart Show (Now Hits UK Chart Show - Sam Thompson), replacing the local chart previously broadcast in the slot.

On Monday 23 October 2023, Lincs FM started broadcasting Hits Radio programming outside of breakfast, although &quot;The Farming Programme&quot;, which aired as part of the Sunday breakfast show, continued to air as normal.

It was announced on 10 January 2024 that from April 2024, the Lincs FM name was to be dropped along with 14 other heritage FM station names in the Hits Radio network, and would become Hits Radio Lincolnshire. The announcement marked the end of the Lincs FM brand after just over 30 years of broadcasting.

==Transmitters==

The main transmitter 102.2 FM signal comes from the Belmont transmitting station. It also has lower-powered frequencies in Grantham, south of the town near the bypass, on 96.7 FM and Trent View Flats (near the John Leggott College) in Scunthorpe on 97.6 FM. Lincs FM can be clearly heard in northern Nottinghamshire and eastern South Yorkshire. The Belmont transmitter relays Digital One and in 2015 a local Lincolnshire multiplex was launched from the site. This operates on the old MXR frequency 12B. The Lincs FM Group broadcasting engineer is Andy Langford.

On 3 April 2023, Lincs FM&#x27;s FM frequencies were replaced with a relay of Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire, with Lincs FM continuing on DAB.

<doc id="938034" wikidata="Q6750113" url="?curid=938034" title="Manitoba Party (1998)">
<text>The Manitoba Party was a political party in Manitoba, Canada. It was formed in 1998, and fielded twelve candidates in the 1999 provincial election, none of whom came close to being elected. It attempted to contest the 2003 election as well, but was not able to find the five candidates needed for official ballot status. It is possible that some independent candidates in 2003 were actually representatives of the Manitoba Party.

The Manitoba Party advocated fundamental changes to the province&#x27;s political system in the 1999 campaign, referring to the existing government structure as an &quot;elected dictatorship&quot;. It promoted greater grass-roots participation, and claimed that any MLAs it elected would be allowed to vote according to the wishes of their constituents, rather than an official party line.

The party also promised debt reduction and lower taxes, and was particularly concerned with the plight of farmers in the province&#x27;s southwestern corner. The general orientation of the MP may be described as right-wing and populist, though it is unclear if the party articulated any positions on social issues.

Roger Woloshyn was the party&#x27;s leader throughout its existence. In 2000, its President was Brian Hanslip.

<doc id="938036" wikidata="Q948618" url="?curid=938036" title="Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen FRS FZS FRGS MBOU (6 July 1834 – 2 December 1923), known until 1854 as Henry Haversham Austen, was an English topographer, surveyor, naturalist and geologist.

He explored the mountains in the Himalayas and surveyed the glaciers at the base of K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen. Geographer Kenneth Mason called Godwin-Austen &quot;probably the greatest mountaineer of his day&quot;. He also remains the most important investigator of the terrestrial molluscs of the Indian subcontinent.

==Early life==
The eldest son of the eighteen children of the geologist Robert Austen, who in 1854 added Godwin to his surname by royal licence, Henry Haversham Austen was probably born at Ogwell House, near Newton Abbot, Devon, where his father had recently taken up residence. His father&#x27;s family, landowners in Cheshire and Surrey since the 12th century, had a history as merchant venturers, soldiers, scholars, and collectors. His grandfather, Sir Henry Edmund Austen (1785–1871), was a High Sheriff and Deputy Lieutenant for Surrey and a gentleman of the Privy Chamber to King William IV. His great-grandfather, Robert Austen (died 1797), married Lady Frances Annesley, a descendant of Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey.

Austen&#x27;s mother, Maria Elizabeth Godwin, was the only child of Major-General Sir Henry Godwin (1784–1853), who had fought in the First Anglo-Burmese War and who commanded the British and Indian forces in the Second. His brother Edmund Godwin Austen played first-class cricket for Canterbury in New Zealand. H. H. Austen was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and then from 1848 to 1851 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. At Sandhurst he learnt military surveying from Captain Robert Petley and was a contemporary of the future Lord Roberts.

==Life in Burma and India==
In 1851, after leaving the Royal Military College, Austen was commissioned into the 24th Foot. In early 1853 he arrived in Burma at the end of the Second Anglo-Burmese war, serving as aide-de-camp to his maternal grandfather, General Sir Henry Godwin. The latter died unexpectedly in 1853, and as a result his daughter&#x27;s family added the name of Godwin to their own, becoming Godwin-Austen.

While in Burma, he surveyed the Irrawaddy Delta, and this work came to the favourable notice of Sir Andrew Scott Waugh, Surveyor General of India. After periods in Simla and Sialkot, Godwin-Austen was posted to Peshawar under the command of Major General Thomas Reed. In 1856, he joined the Trigonometrical Survey of India and began to work in Kashmir under Captain Thomas George Montgomerie. In May 1856 he was promoted Lieutenant, in March 1857 he was formally appointed to the Survey of India, and on 29 October 1858 he was further promoted to Captain.

A liaison with an Indian lady named Kudidje, the daughter of a Muslim landowner of Poonch, probably a Sudhan, may have begun as early as 1855, and this led to the birth on 5 May 1857 of a son who was named Edward. Another source says that Edward was born at Sialkot on 15 March 1859. The relationship is seen by one biographer as probably an obstacle to Godwin-Austen&#x27;s advancement in India. In April 1857 Godwin-Austen was posted to Kashmir. In June 1858 he married Kudidje in a ceremony near Budrawar; from the British point of view the marriage was legal as it satisfied Muslim conditions. In November 1858, Godwin-Austen was seriously injured in an attack near Udhampur which left him unconscious, and in April 1859 he took a year&#x27;s home leave, joining the Second Battalion of his regiment in England. While there, he became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

From 1857 to June 1860 he had worked for the Survey of India, mainly around the Kazi Nag, Pir Panjal, and Marau-Warwan regions. He was given a permanent post in the Trigonometrical Survey and in 1860 mapped Shigar and the lower Saltoro Valley of Baltistan as far as the south face of K1, Masherbrum. In 1861, he traversed the Skoro La, beyond Skardu and Shigar, where he surveyed the Karakoram glaciers: Baltoro, Punmah, Biafo, Chiring, almost as far as the Old Mustagh Pass and Hispar. On this expedition, he climbed at least 1000 m above Urdukas on the Baltoro Glacier, and fixed the height and position of K2 for the first time.

In 1860, after a separation of some fifteen months, Godwin-Austen and Kudidje were reunited, and she accompanied him on his first expedition to Baltistan. However, after September 1860 she disappears from the record, and Godwin-Austen arranged the adoption of their son by a couple named Milner, so it is likely that Kudidje had died by late 1860. A few months before his death in 1923, Godwin-Austen received the surprise of a letter from a Mrs Barclay, one of their grandchildren, a daughter of Edward, and in reply recalled of Kudidje &quot;She was a good wife with me and if there is anything now left that I can look back on and love, it is her memory and the way she looked after me.&quot;

On 5 April 1861 Godwin-Austen married Pauline Georgiana, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Wellesley Chichele Plowden, granddaughter of William Plowden (1787–1880), an East India Company director, and niece of William Chichele Plowden, an Indian civilian. Their first child, Alfred, was born in March 1862, but lived less than three months. Pauline herself died in 1871, leaving one surviving son, Arthur.

In 1862, Godwin-Austen surveyed upper Changchenmo, Pangong district, and the Zanskar ranges, resulting in his &quot;Notes on the Pangong Lake District of Ladakh&quot; (1864).

Although he gave great attention to geology and topography, his greatest interest lay in collecting non-marine molluscs and in identifying birds. He published his &quot;Birds of Assam&quot; (1870–1878) and described a number of birds for the first time, some with Arthur Hay, 9th Marquess of Tweeddale. Most of these notes were published in the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot; and Godwin-Austen sometimes drew illustrations of the new bird species. He was particularly active in ornithology after 1863, when he was posted in the eastern Himalayas as part of the political mission to Bhutan headed by Ashley Eden. He surveyed the Garo, Khasi, and Jaintia hills, and in 1875 joined an expedition into the Daphla Hills. Venturing into anthropology, he described the monuments and customs of the Khasi tribes.

==Retirement==
In 1877, Godwin-Austen retired from the Trigonometrical Survey of India with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, as his health was beginning to deteriorate, but back in England he recovered. In 1881, he married lastly Jessie, daughter of John Harding Robinson, an Examiner in the House of Lords. She was 20 and he 47. They remained married until his wife&#x27;s death in 1913, and the marriage has been called &quot;a union of love and mutual support&quot;. An obituary stated that, &quot;of a most attractive disposition and singular charm of manner, Godwin-Austen was much beloved by his contemporaries&quot;. He served as a justice of the peace from 1885.

When his father died in 1884, Godwin-Austen inherited an estate and substantial house at Shalford, in Surrey. The estate no longer provided sufficient income to fund such a house. Unable to sell land because of an entail, he was declared bankrupt in 1899, although through the sale of the house he had discharged the bankruptcy by 1902. Thereafter he lived at another property on the estate, Nore House near Godalming.
Godwin-Austen produced numerous research articles on the terrestrial molluscs that he had collected in India. He sold this collection to the British Museum, but parts were loaned back in turn for him to work on, besides which he visited the museum regularly to catalogue both his own and others&#x27; collections from India (work for which he was paid). He had also sold this museum his collection of birds, about 3,500 skins collected in Manipur and Assam. Unlike most contemporary malacologists, he described not just the shells but also the internal anatomy and radula teeth, which often better distinguish species and more reliably assign them to families. He took over the authorship of the first volume of the &quot;Fauna of British India&quot; devoted to terrestrial molluscs, but he was subsequently replaced by G.K. Gude, who could work faster because his descriptions were more superficial. Instead Godwin-Austen chose to work on his own at his own pace, publishing most of his results in &quot;The Land and Freshwater Mollusca of India&quot;, appearing in 13 parts from 1882 to 1920. This research brought him recognition, and he served as president of the Malacological Society of London (1897–1899), president of the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland (1908–1909) and vice president of the Zoological Society of London (1895). In 1880 he had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1910 he received the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.

He died on 2 December 1923 at Nore, looked after in the last 10 years of his life by his sister Beatrice.

Family tradition holds that Haversham Godwin-Austen was a convert to the Buddhist faith (following a self-attested period as an at least nominal Muslim in the middle to late 1850s), and as such he may be the first known British adherent to Buddhism. His small Burmese-style Buddhist shrine at Nore, Hascombe, Surrey, is likely to have been erected there around 1901 (although a later date of c. 1920 is possible), perhaps after being situated at each of Godwin-Austen&#x27;s successive main residences from 1877 onwards, following his return to England after 25 years in Asia. Accordingly, the shrine probably constitutes the first ever custom-built physical structure raised for Buddhist devotional purposes in Britain. It was forgotten and lost to view under brambles after Godwin-Austen&#x27;s time, prior to rediscovery in 1962 by a new owner of Nore, actor Dirk Bogarde.

Godwin-Austen&#x27;s conversion – and possibly his shrine – therefore predates the earliest formal Buddhist missions to Britain: namely, those of the Japanese-sponsored &#x27;Buddhist Propagation Society&#x27;, led by Irish-born Captain Charles J. W. Pfoundes in 1889, and that of English convert Charles Henry Allan Bennett, also known as &#x27;Ananda Metteyya&#x27;, in 1908. &#x27;The Buddhist Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland&#x27; was formed in 1907.

==Legacy==

The second-highest mountain in the world, the Karakoram peak K2 in the Himalayas, was at one time renamed Mount Godwin-Austen, in honour of its first surveyor. The Godwin-Austen Glacier was also named in his honour.

Godwin-Austen &quot;stands out as by far the most important investigator of Indian Mollusca.&quot; His &quot;The land and freshwater molluscs of India&quot; has been described as &quot;an epoch-making work on Indian land molluscs, also indispensable in the study of all Oriental and Ethiopian faunas.&quot; The mollusc genera &quot;Austenia&quot; G. Nevill, 1878, &quot;Godwinia&quot; Sykes, 1900, and several Indian species have been named in his honour. Godwin-Austen is also commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards: &quot;Pachydactylus austeni&quot; and &quot;Pseudocalotes austeniana&quot;.

His son R.A. Godwin-Austen was also a career army officer and was later a supporter of the &quot;saintly mafia&quot; called Ferguson&#x27;s Gang, dedicated to saving historically important buildings. H. H. Godwin-Austen&#x27;s nephew, General Sir Alfred Godwin-Austen (1889–1963), was a divisional commander of the East African and Western Desert campaigns during the Second World War.

Godwin-Austen&#x27;s son by Kudidje, Edward, who had been adopted by a family named Milner, became a civil engineer in Hyderabad State and elsewhere. In 1879 he married Emma Theresa Smith, and they had fifteen children. Edward Henry Hastings Milner died in Bombay in 1917, aged only 59, but his widow lived until 1958.

<doc id="938037" wikidata="Q1285108" url="?curid=938037" title="G. Wayne Clough">
<text>Gerald Wayne Clough (born September 24, 1941) is an American civil engineer and educator who is President Emeritus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and former Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. A graduate of Georgia Tech in civil engineering, he was the first alumnus to serve as President of the Institute.

The Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons, which officially opened its doors in August 2011, is named in his honor. Clough has garnered many other awards and honors, including the title of President Emeritus, two Norman Medals, eight honorary degrees, and membership in the National Science Board.

==Personal life and education==
Clough was born on September 24, 1941, in Douglas, Georgia, the youngest of three children born to Daniel and Bessie (née Johnson) Clough. Clough&#x27;s parents ran the local ice and coal plant. After electricity spread to south Georgia, the family moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Clough attended City High School. Clough also met his future wife, Anne Olivia Robinson, during this time. They have two children, Eliza and Matthew.

Clough entered Georgia Tech in 1959 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering in 1964. While an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, Clough participated in the cooperative education program, and was, against his wishes, a surveyor for a railroad company. Clough was a member of Georgia Tech&#x27;s chapter of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and lived in their fraternity house on North Avenue for half a year. Clough originally planned to receive only a bachelor&#x27;s degree; however, the faculty encouraged him to pursue a graduate degree, so he continued his education and received his master&#x27;s degree in civil engineering in 1965. In 1969, Clough received a Ph.D. in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, with the thesis &quot;Finite element analyses of soil-structures interaction in U-frame locks&quot;.

==Research==
After earning his doctorate, Clough began his academic career as an assistant professor at Duke University in 1969. He joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1974 first as an associate professor and then later as full professor. In 1982, he joined the faculty of Virginia Tech as a professor of civil engineering and served as head of their Department of Civil Engineering for seven years. In 1990, Clough became dean of the Virginia Tech College of Engineering. Clough continued his research and instruction of graduate students at Virginia Tech in addition to his administrative responsibilities. Clough&#x27;s research focused on geotechnical engineering, including earthquake studies, numerical analysis, soil structure interaction, in-situ testing, and underground openings. In 1993, he became provost and vice president for academic affairs at the University of Washington. Clough cofounded the United States Universities Council of Geotechnical Engineering Research (USUCGER), and served as the organization&#x27;s first president during 1993.

==President of Georgia Tech==
On September 1, 1994, Clough became the first Georgia Tech alumnus to serve as the President of the Institute, succeeding John Patrick Crecine, and was in office during the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1998, he separated the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs into the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and the College of Management, which he returned to independent status. This separation was a major organizational change that built upon the large (and controversial) reorganization of the institute by Clough&#x27;s predecessor.

During his tenure, research expenditures increased from $212 million to $425 million, computers became required for all students, and enrollment increased from 13,000 to 18,000 students. Tech also received the Hesburgh Award for support of undergraduate teaching and learning, and the Institute&#x27;s &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings steadily improved.

Clough&#x27;s tenure was especially focused on a dramatic expansion of the Institute; more than $1 billion was spent on projects to expand or improve the campus. These projects included the completion of several west campus dorms, the manufacturing complex, 10th and Home, Technology Square, The Biomedical Complex, the Student Center renovation, the expanded 5th Street Bridge, the Aquatic Center&#x27;s renovation into the Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center, a new Health Center, the Klaus Advanced Computing Building, and the Nanotechnology Research Center.

Clough also spearheaded research opportunities for undergraduate students, later known as the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), the creation of an International Plan, and the creation of a fund to make Georgia Tech more affordable for low-income students (the G. Wayne Clough Georgia Tech Promise Program). The students of Georgia Tech affectionately dubbed him &quot;Funk Masta G. Wayne&quot; during his presidency due to the expansion and growth he encouraged in urban Atlanta, and he was generally known to have a warm and friendly disposition and a distinctive beard.

In 2006, members of Georgia Tech&#x27;s college Republican club sued Georgia Tech, aided by the Alliance Defense Fund, in a case known as Sklar v. Clough that lasted until April 2008. The students won this case and Georgia Tech was forced to drop their speech code which was deemed unconstitutional and pay the defendants court costs.

Clough stepped down after almost fourteen years as President on July 1, 2008, which he previously announced in an email to students and staff on March 15, 2008.

==Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution==

On January 1, 2008, the Smithsonian named a search committee for the position of Secretary. Clough&#x27;s primary competition for the position was Acting Secretary Cristián Samper, who had replaced Secretary Lawrence M. Small after Small&#x27;s resignation in 2007. The Smithsonian&#x27;s board of regents, whose duties include electing the Smithsonian&#x27;s secretary, took at least two votes in the Lawyers&#x27; Lounge at the U.S. Supreme Court to arrive at their decision.

Clough was elected the 12th Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; he was notified via a phone call with regents chairman Roger W. Sant on the afternoon of March 14, 2008. This decision was announced publicly at a press conference held at the Smithsonian Castle on March 15, 2008. Clough assumed office on July 1, 2008, and was officially installed in an academic ceremony on January 26, 2009. His starting salary as Secretary was $490,000, a pay cut from his final compensation package at Georgia Tech ($551,186) and significantly lower than his predecessor, Lawrence Small&#x27;s annual salary of $900,000.

Upon assumption of his office, Clough made plans to digitize the Museum&#x27;s collections, and offer more intensive K-12 educational programming. In November 2008, for the first time, the Smithsonian opened a board meeting to the public. He also made efforts to improve the Smithsonian&#x27;s facilities and long-term planning, as well as plans to reorganize and cut back on staff and budget. In February 2012, Clough&#x27;s travel expenses were probed by senator Charles E. Grassley, despite increased controls; Clough&#x27;s travel had to been approved by the Smithsonian&#x27;s chief financial officer as part of the reforms enacted in the wake of alleged abuses by Secretary Small.

On November 30, 2010, Secretary Clough made the decision to remove the David Wojnarowicz video &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; from the National Portrait Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture&quot; exhibition. The video artwork was perceived by some to be anti-Christian and Clough believed it detracted from the entirety of the exhibition, which he said was &quot;to be a powerful exhibit about the contributions of gay and lesbian artists&quot; and not about &quot;religious iconography&quot; and &quot;desecration&quot;. This decision was widely criticized, but Clough responded that he was protecting the Smithsonian&#x27;s larger educational mission. After the controversy, the Smithsonian&#x27;s board of regents appointed an outside panel to examine the decision to remove the work from the exhibition; the panel recommended that art not be removed from shows that have already opened.

On September 18, 2013, after six years as Secretary, Clough announced his retirement, which would be effective October 2014. In announcing his retirement, he said, &quot;When I became Secretary in 2008, I believed strongly that the Smithsonian had enormous untapped potential, especially in digital technology, to reach millions of people and serve as a resource for those who cannot visit Washington. I am confident that with our initiatives underway in bioconservation, education, digitization and fundraising, this is the right time to announce my plans for next fall so that an orderly transition can begin.&quot;

==Honors and awards==

Clough has earned numerous awards and honors during his career. In his early career, he earned two Norman Medals, the State of the Art Award, and the Karl von Terzaghi Lectureship in 1994. Clough has also earned a George Westinghouse Award from the American Society for Engineering Education. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1990 for developing and verifying advanced design and analysis procedures for soil-structure interaction problems. At NAE, he served as a chair of one of its summits in 2004, The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century.

In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed him to the President&#x27;s Council of Science and Technology. In 2004, Bush appointed him a member of the National Science Board, which oversees the National Science Foundation and provides advice to Congress and the president on issues of science and technology. Also in 2004, the American Society of Civil Engineers presented him with the Outstanding Projects and Leaders award for his contribution to education, and the University of California, Berkeley College of Engineering honored him with one of the four Distinguished Engineering Alumni Awards.

In 2008, Clough was made an honorary member of the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech&#x27;s oldest known secret society and honor society. In October 2008, the National Academy of Engineering presented Clough with the Arthur M. Bueche Award for leadership in science, technology, and engineering policy. In February 2009, he received the Joseph M. Pettit Alumni Distinguished Service Award that recognizes a lifetime of leadership, achievement and service to Georgia Tech; and in March 2009, he was inducted into the Technology Hall of Fame of Georgia.

Clough has received eight honorary Doctor of Science degrees. In 2011, he received an honorary degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; in 2010, he received honorary degrees from Oglethorpe University in Atlanta; University of Maryland, Baltimore County; and Williams College in Williamstown. He had previously received honorary doctorates from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Florida Southern College and the University of South Carolina. In April 2010, he was named a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

During the ground breaking ceremony for the G. Wayne Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons building held in 2010, President Bud Peterson and University System of Georgia Chancellor Erroll B. Davis Jr. presented to Clough a proclamation declaring him President Emeritus of the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2011, Georgia Tech opened the G. Wayne Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons building named in honor of his commitment to undergraduate students; it was dedicated on Clough&#x27;s birthday, September 24, 2011. In May 2011, he was awarded the 2011 Foreign Policy Association Medal.

<doc id="938048" wikidata="Q5691906" url="?curid=938048" title="Heart Berkshire">
<text>Heart Berkshire (formerly 2-Ten FM) was an Independent Local Radio station, serving Berkshire and North Hampshire from studios in Reading.

==About==
Launched as Radio 210 (Two-One-Oh), the station commenced broadcasting in March 1976 on its medium-wave frequency of 210metres (1,431 kHz). It later became known as 210-FM, later as 2-Ten FM, and was part of The One Network group of stations owned and operated by Global Radio by 2008. The station was rebranded a year later as part of the Heart Network.

==History==
The original parent company, Radio Kennet had won the licence to broadcast as far back as 1974, but plans for the station to float on the London Stock Exchange as soon as it commenced broadcasting failed as it did not raise enough funding. Radio Kennet returned in 1976 as Thames Valley Broadcasting.

Radio 210 first broadcast on 8 March 1976 at 6a.m. Former BBC Radio 2 DJ Paul Hollingdale played the Carpenters record &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; at the start of his four-hour breakfast show. Other early presenters were Steve Wright, Mike Read, Tony Fox, Steve Crozier (&quot;Yer Man Croze&quot;), Mike Matthews, John Flower, Tony Holden, Steve Wood, Mike Quinn, Dave Glass, John Hayes (deceased), Gavin McCoy, Bob Morrison, Graham Ledger, Mike Sanderson (the Folk Show), Martin Dean (the Soul Show) and news editor David Addis. Rising stars Mike Read and Steve Wright co-hosted the Read &amp; Wright Show at weekends before gaining daily shows and later pursuing high-profile careers on BBC Radio 1. Other presenters made the opposite move, leaving the BBC to join Radio 210, including Bob Harris and David Hamilton, the latter having defected from BBC Radio 2 because of changes in that station&#x27;s music policy.

Radio 210 initially only served Reading with a transmitter on 97.0 MHz FM on top of The Butts shopping centre; however that changed when it began broadcasting from the Hannington transmitter on a second frequency of 102.9 MHz at midday 1 January 1987 to serve a wider area of Berkshire and north Hampshire, with a Henley-on-Thames relay added in 1997.

==Split frequencies==
In 1990, Radio 210 split frequencies (as required then to do so by Government due to a radio act recently passed to end simulcasting) to provide two services – 210-FM (Now broadcasting as Heart South) and 210 Classic Gold Radio. The AM transmitter was actually a relay of Brunel Classic Gold&#x27;s service from Bristol. Also, broadcast to Bournemouth, Devon, &amp; Swindon. It took a couple of networked shows. One Sunday Lunchtime show with David Hamilton, and also Jimmy Savile&#x27;s Saviles Travels (1990–92). It stopped taking that because it was said that they preferred to broadcast their own shows. Classic Gold featured slightly more known presenters like Tony Gillham (head of music), and Trevor Fry. Paul Burnett joined in 1996, and Tony Blackburn a few years later. They were both dropped in July 2007, when Classic Gold was taken over by GCap Media, and became known as Gold.

Radio 210 claimed to be &quot;the only comprehensive travel service in the Thames Valley and North Hampshire&quot;. The station broadcast news bulletins on the hour every hour and regional news during certain points throughout the day.

==Network restructuring==
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to merge Heart Berkshire with Heart Oxfordshire as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 15. The new station, &quot;Heart Thames Valley&quot; began broadcasting from Reading on 9 July 2010.

<doc id="938049" wikidata="Q2176894" url="?curid=938049" title="Russell (lunar crater)">
<text>Russell is the lava-flooded remains of a lunar impact crater. It is located in the western part of the Oceanus Procellarum, close to the western lunar limb. As a result, it appears oblong-shaped due to foreshortening.

The south-southwestern rim of Russell overlaps the larger rim of the lava-flooded crater Struve, and together the two crater rims form a figure-8 outline with a wide gap where they are joined. To the east of Russell is Briggs, and to the southeast, adjacent to Struve, is the lava-flooded remains of a crater called Eddington.

The rim of Russell is heavily worn and irregular in form, with multiple crater impacts overlying the wall. The largest of these is Briggs A on the eastern rim. To the north of Russell are the flooded remnants of several smaller craters. Russell&#x27;s lava-flooded floor is flat and level with the surrounding mare. It lacks a central peak.

In the past this crater was sometimes designated as Otto Struve A, or just assumed to be part of the larger Struve. The crater Eddington to the southeast has also been designated as Otto Struve A on old lunar maps.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Russell.

<text>Tutong District (; Jawi: دائيره توتوڠ) or simply known as Tutong (&quot;&quot;), is the third largest and populated district in Brunei. It has an area of and the population of 47,210 as of 2021. The district is also home to its administrative centre is Tutong Town (), as well as the Tutong River and Tasek Merimbun, the country&#x27;s second longest river and the only ASEAN Heritage Parks in Brunei respectively.

== Geography ==
The district borders the South China Sea to the north, Brunei–Muara District to the northeast, Sarawak to the east and south, and Belait District to the west. Covering , it is the third-largest district in Brunei. The 137 kilometre Tutong River, the district&#x27;s primary river, flows from the interior in the south to the South China Sea. Bukit Bedawan, the district&#x27;s highest point, stands at 529 meters. The district also hosts Tasek Merimbun, Brunei&#x27;s largest natural lake, designated as an ASEAN Heritage Park since 29 November 1984.

Compared to Temburong District, which is isolated from Brunei proper, Tutong is in a more beneficial position due to its extremely strategic placement between the Brunei–Muara and Belait districts. This is due to the fact that, despite having less economic potential than Temburong, the Tutong District benefits from a better location in terms of development, as all major roads and highways pass through it and connect the state&#x27;s administrative center, the Belait District, with Brunei&#x27;s economic centre, the Brunei–Muara District.

== History ==
Tutong was formerly a part of the Melanau administration in the 14th century before joining the Bruneian Empire in the 15th century.

Early in 1901, Dato Di Gadong organised an uprising in Tutong, purportedly with the backing of Rajah of Sarawak, Sir Charles Brooke, who wanted to use Brunei&#x27;s instability as a pretext for annexing the area. Brooke&#x27;s proposal was thwarted when the British authorities cautioned him not to intervene. While most rebels received amnesty from the Bruneian authorities, Dato Di Gadong and Dato Kalam of Limau Manis were left out and fled to Limbang, where they were found guilty of stealing carabao. When Dato Di Gadong returned to Tutong illegally in 1902, Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II ordered his death. Dato Di Gadong was also suspected of many killings.

Prior to the introduction of the British Residency in Brunei in 1906, Tutong was a (belonging to state officials), a type of land ownership in Brunei&#x27;s traditional government. It was the non-hereditary land of , one of the four traditional Wazirs to the Sultan. Healthcare in the district began with the establishment of a medical clinic in 1932 in Bukit Bendera area near the district town Pekan Tutong. Before the Tutong Bridge was built in 1959, Brunei Town (present day Bandar Seri Begawan) and Brunei&#x27;s southern districts could only be reached by ferrying between Danau and Kuala Tutong. 

In 1967, the government moved quickly to provide areas that the local populace needed and found convenient. A modern B$500,000 structure was also constructed in lieu of the government building. A community centre, playground, police and fire stations, a carpentry school, an English primary school, a telecom facility, and guest residences for the village chief and district officer are among the other structures that were constructed. In addition, wells, bridges, and paved roads have been constructed to raise the level of living. The district have seen a rapid rise in population by nearly 15,000 in that same year.

== Administration ==
The procedures for the board&#x27;s business conduct are outlined in the Tutong Municipal Board (Standing Orders) By-Laws, 2014. Meeting procedures, such as notification requirements, quorum requirements, and the responsibilities of the chairman and secretary, are outlined in the bylaws. Members must adhere to certain voting and speaking procedures, and meetings must begin with a prayer. The chairman is in charge of the meeting, and every motion needs to be submitted in writing and seconded before it can be discussed. These bylaws guarantee the Municipal Board&#x27;s organised and orderly governance.

The district is administered by the Tutong District Office (), a government department under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The district is subdivided into 8 mukims, namely:

According to the Constitution, the district is to be represented in the Legislative Council, the state legislature, by up to 7 members. As of 2023, two members have been appointed to represent the district in the legislature.

== Demographics ==
The main ethnic groups in the district consist of Tutong, Dusun, Kedayan, Iban and Chinese. Since much of Tutong&#x27;s interior is still covered in dense forest, where some of the non-Malay indigenous people live, the majority of the population resides along the shore. In 2020, the district&#x27;s population was estimated to have increased to 51,500.

=== Religion ===
With slower expansion in inland areas like Belait, Tutong, and Temburong, Islam eventually spread across the country. About 200 years before to 1988, an individual by the name of (Pehin) Julak brought Islam to Tutong. Approximately 300 years ago, , adherents of Sultan Husin Kamaluddin dispersed Islam over Temburong. Evidence found by the Brunei History Centre (PSB) indicates that Islam may have reached Tutong much earlier. In a Muslim cemetery in Sugan, Bukit Bendera, a gravestone with the date Hijrah 969 (1561 AD) was discovered. It was written in Jawi Kufi script. This finding suggests that Islam could have been practiced in Tutong as early as 1561, which is about 400 years ago—much earlier than previously thought. The gravestone may have been made by the same artist because of its similar design to others in Bandar Seri Begawan, including Sultan Bolkiah&#x27;s tombstone at Kota Batu.

Given its closeness to Brunei (present day Brunei–Muara), Tutong may have adopted Islam sooner than Belait and Temburong. Between Brunei and Belait, it functioned as a port of call for tourists and traders, giving Muslim businesspeople the chance to spread Islam among the indigenous populace. Islam was present in Tutong at least by the early 16th century, maybe under the rule of Sultan Saiful Rijal, according to oral tradition and gravestone evidence.

==Transportation==
===Road===

Additional road infrastructure improvement projects, including those in Tutong District, will be implemented through the National Development Plan (RKN) 2007–2012. These projects include the first phase of widening Jalan Lamunin (earthworks), the construction of small roads along Kampong Batang Mitus, Kampong Kebia, and Penapar Bridge to Lubok Pulau, and the third phase of replacing the current wooden bridges. The Muara–Tutong Highway is the main route running across Tutong, which connects to the Brunei–Muara and Belait districts.

===Water===
Due to a shallow, sandbar that shifts periodically near the river mouth, Tutong Town, which is located on the northern bank of the Tutong River approximately 8 miles upstream, has few shipping options. The settlement has a 20-foot wooden pier that is mostly used by government patrol boats and indigenous vessels. Kuala Tutong on the north bank is connected to Danau on the south bank by a government-run car ferry service. The M.A. &quot;Pemancha,&quot; a bigger all-steel vessel that was introduced in May, has boosted traffic and enhanced the efficiency of this ferry service, which is essential for connecting the two sides of the state. In addition, Tutong issued licenses to eighteen fishing vessels in 1957.

Tenders have been called for the design and construction of two large bridge sites, one over the Tutong River near Tutong and another over the Telamba River near Telisai, which will replace the Kuala Tutong Ferry service. A route has been surveyed and found favorable for road construction earlier in 1953. On 25 December 1958, Tutong–Danau ferries came to a stop, signaling the end of an era. The Tutong Bridge was opened in 1959, this allowed continuous vehicle movement from Bandar Seri Begawan through Tutong was made feasible by the bridge over the river.

<text>Richard Kirwan, LL.D, FRS, FRSE MRIA (1 August 1733 – 22 June 1812) was an Irish geologist and chemist. He was one of the last supporters of the theory of phlogiston.

Kirwan was active in the fields of chemistry, meteorology, and geology. He was widely known in his day, corresponding and meeting with Lavoisier, Black, Priestley, and Cavendish.

== Life and work ==

Richard Kirwan was born at Cloughballymore, County Galway, the second son of Martin Kirwan of Cregg (d.1741), and his wife, Mary French (d.1751). He was a descendant of William Ó Ciardhubháin and a member of The Tribes of Galway. Part of his early life was spent abroad, and in 1754 he entered the Jesuit novitiate either at St Omer or at Hesdin, but returned to Ireland in the following year when he succeeded to the family estates through the death of his brother in a duel. Kirwan married &quot;Miss Blake&quot; in 1757, but his wife only lived eight more years. The couple had two daughters, Maria Theresa and Eliza.

In 1766, having conformed to the established religion (Church of Ireland) two years previously, Kirwan was called to the Irish Bar, but in 1768 abandoned practice in favour of scientific pursuits. During the next nineteen years, he resided chiefly in London, enjoying the society of the scientific men living there and corresponding with many savants on the continent of Europe, as his wide knowledge of languages enabled him to do with ease. His experiments on the specific gravities and attractive powers of various saline substances formed a substantial contribution to the methods of analytical chemistry and in 1782 gained him the Copley medal from the Royal Society, of which he was elected a fellow in 1780. In 1784, he was engaged in a controversy with Henry Cavendish in regard to the latter&#x27;s experiments about air. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1784 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1786.

In 1787, Kirwan moved to Dublin, where, in 1799, he became president of the Royal Irish Academy until his death. To its proceedings, he contributed some thirty-eight memoirs dealing with meteorology, pure and applied chemistry, geology, magnetism and philology. One of these, on the primitive state of the globe and its subsequent catastrophe, involved him in a lively dispute with the upholders of the Huttonian theory. His geological work was marred by an implicit belief in the universal deluge and through finding fossils associated with the trap rocks near Portrush that he maintained basalt was of aqueous origin.
Kirwan was one of the last supporters in Britain and Ireland of the theory of phlogiston, for which he contended in his &quot;Essay on Phlogiston and the Constitution of Acids&quot; (1787), identifying phlogiston with hydrogen. This work, translated by Marie-Anne Pierette Paulze, was published in French with critical notes by Lavoisier and some of his associates. Kirwan attempted to refute their arguments, but they proved too strong for him, and he acknowledged himself a convert in 1791.

There is evidence to suggest that Kirwan was a member of the Society of the United Irishmen, a revolutionary republican organisation in 18th century Ireland. The United Irishmen were founded as a reformist club by a group of Irish radical Protestants and Presbyterians in 1791, influenced by the American and French revolutions. Gradually becoming more militant, the Society advocated for Catholic emancipation and the overthrow in Ireland of British rule. This movement culminated in the defeat of the United Irishmen in the 1798 Rebellion and the Act of Union.

At the time of the Union, Kirwan refused a baronetcy, died in Dublin in June 1812, and was buried there in St. George&#x27;s Church, Lower Temple Street. Kirwan&#x27;s library was sold at auction in Dublin by Thomas Jones on 12 April 1813 (and following days); a copy of the catalogue is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.159(12)).

==Eccentricities==

Various stories are told of Kirwan&#x27;s eccentricities as well as of his conversational powers. It is said that flies &quot;were his especial aversion; he kept a pet eagle, and was attended by six large dogs.&quot; Kirwan disliked flies and paid his servants for each time they were killed. He also disliked late visitors and had his door-knocker removed each evening at seven o&#x27;clock.

Kirwan suffered from dysphagia and always dined alone. He lived on an exclusive diet of ham and milk. The ham was cooked on Sunday and reheated for the rest of the week. Kirwan was obsessed with avoiding a cold. He heated his living room all year round with a fire and always wore an overcoat indoors.

<text>Heart Norwich (formerly Radio Broadland) was an Independent Local Radio station for Norfolk and North Suffolk, including Norwich, Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, until early 2009. The station, now part of the national Heart Network, is owned and operated by Global Radio.

==Station history==
On 1 October 1984, a new independent local radio station called &quot;Radio Broadland&quot; was launched by a Norfolk-based group with experience in local business, newspapers and television, but little in radio.

Several people with extensive radio experience were brought in to start the station. Russell Stuart arrived from Gwent Broadcasting in Newport as managing director, Mike Stewart from Radio West in Bristol as programme controller and Robb Young moved from Radio Orwell in Ipswich as sales manager.

Stewart put together the first team of presenters. Nick Risby joined from Red Rose Radio in Preston, Tony Gillham came from Chiltern and BBC Radio Bedfordshire, Dave Brown from Radio Tees, Rob Chandler from Radio Orwell and Adrian Finighan from Gwent Radio. Dave Brown became programme controller of the station in the late 1990s, while Rob Chandler remained for 30 years, including more than 25 years as breakfast presenter, until leaving the station in December 2013. Another long server was Chrissie Jackson, who lasted for 27 years including 14 as joint breakfast host, until leaving at the same time as Rob Chandler. Bob Harris presented a weekly show on the station for a time after it launched, while he was living in the area.

For the first two years, Radio Broadland went off air at 10pm until 6am the following morning. The station simulcasted on 97.6FM and 1152AM for three years, but in 1987, due to national changes in local radio frequencies, moved to 102.4FM. Broadland at the end of the 1980s was achieving an audience reach of 50 per cent and average weekly listening of up to 18 hours per listener, some of the best in the UK.

In 1990, Broadland took over Suffolk Group Radio, which owned Radio Orwell in Ipswich and Saxon Radio in Bury St Edmunds and, to reflect the addition of the new stations, the company became East Anglian Radio. The two Suffolk stations were renamed and re-launched as SGR fm in 1992. The group later won the licence to launch a station in Colchester under the SGR banner in 1993.

Initially, Radio Broadland played both classic hit music and current chart hits, but in 1995 the decision was made by the EAR group to make better use of the AM slot. Amber Radio was created in Norfolk and Suffolk playing 60s and 70s music, whilst Broadland 102 focused more on current and recent chart hits. The EAR group continued to be run by the original Broadland management team.

In 1996, the GWR Group bid more than £25 million for the East Anglian Radio group, which later resulted in changes to the station such as networked programming and a new strapline of &quot;Today&#x27;s Better Music Mix&quot;. The original management remained in different roles with GWR and then GCap, but had all left by 2003. Mike Stewart and Russell Stuart were part of a new company, Norwich Radio Group, which narrowly failed to win a new ILR licence advertised in 2005 for Norwich.

In 2007, the station reverted to the name of Radio Broadland, adopting &#x27;More Music Variety&#x27; to reflect an emphasis on classic hits in place of chart material. Also that year, as with all of GCap&#x27;s One Network, the station gained a new logo and website.

An offer of £375 million for the GCap group from Global Radio, owner of Heart and LBC in London and Galaxy station, was accepted in 2008. All GCap&#x27;s senior management departed on completion of the takeover.

==Heart re-brand==
In January 2009, Radio Broadland was renamed as &quot;Heart Norwich&quot;, as part of a major re-branding involving 29 stations owned by Global Radio. By this time, local programming was restricted to daily breakfast and weekday drivetime with all other output networked from London.

===Network restructuring===
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to merge Heart Norwich with Heart Ipswich as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The new station, Heart East Anglia, began broadcasting from Norwich on 3 September 2010.

The former Radio Broadland studios in Norwich were closed, after nearly 35 years, in the summer of 2019, and the building was put up for sale. Broadcasting on the Heart network moved from a local to a regional basis, with Heart East Anglia emanating from studios at Milton Keynes.

In April 2021, it was announced that the University of East Anglia would open a broadcast journalism course centre at the Colegate building in the autumn. It meant that the still-intact studio areas would be retained, just a few weeks before they were due to be demolished.

<text>Ireland competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eighteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics.

The Olympic Council of Ireland sent a total of 46 athletes to the Games, 32 men and 14 women, to compete in nine sports. The International Olympic Committee allowed athletes from Northern Ireland the option to compete at the Olympic games for either Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or for Ireland. Ireland&#x27;s Olympic campaign for the Games started with a controversy, as middle-distance runner Cathal Lombard failed a drug test for EPO, and was not allowed to compete.

Originally, Ireland left Athens with only a gold medal from show jumper Cian O&#x27;Connor. On 8 October 2004, International Federation for Equestrian Sports announced that Waterford Crystal, owned by O&#x27;Connor, failed a horse doping test for fluphenazine and zuclopenthixol that formally stripped off O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Olympic title in early 2005. Because O&#x27;Connor decided not to appeal, he was formally stripped of his Olympic title, which was awarded to silver medalist Rodrigo Pessoa of Brazil.

==Athletics ==

Irish athletes achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of three athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard). Middle-distance runner Cathal Lombard was initially selected to the team, but he failed a drug test for EPO, and was not allowed to compete.

<doc id="938062" wikidata="Q263285" url="?curid=938062" title="Temburong District">
<text>Temburong District (; Jawi: دائيره تمبوروڠ) or simply known as Temburong (&quot;&quot;; ), is the second largest and least populated district in Brunei. It has an area of and the population of 9,444 as of 2021. The district is also home to its administrative centre, Bangar Town (), as well as the Temburong River and Ulu Temburong National Park, the country&#x27;s third longest river and a national park in Brunei respectively.

== Geography ==
The Malaysian district of Limbang divided the Temburong District, an exclave, from the rest of Brunei. It is a location for ecotourism and is home to a large portion of the Sultanate&#x27;s virgin rainforests. Nestled between the Limbang and Trusan Rivers on all sides, Bukit Pagon (1,850 m) dominates the eastern region of Brunei.

The Royal Geographical Society and Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) are coordinating international rainforest research in Temburong District, which is rich in tropical rainforest. The region is inaccessible, but it has substantial gravel reserves that have been actively mined to satisfy rising building demand. This then gives place to montane vegetation with stunted, gnarled trees covered in mosses in the upper Temburong region as the ground climbs over . This is in contrast to a major portion of Brunei, which has managed to preserve its wooded terrain as most people live around the shore and the majority of its economic growth has been centred around hydrocarbon fossil resources, these woods have not been extensively exploited.

It is suggested that a few tiny islands covered in mangroves be designated as nature sanctuaries because of their ecological significance and rich biodiversity. Proposals for conservation include islands like Pulau Kitang, Siarau, and Selirong; Pulau Kitang may support the proboscis monkey. Because these places are important for fisheries, biological filters, and sediment stability, the Biology Department at the UBD is in favour of their protection. Even if there may be restricted development for social or commercial reasons, it is recommended that any disturbance adhere to comprehensive environmental impact evaluations.

The Temburong River is an integral element of the Brunei estuary, which is a vital nursery and feeding ground for marine life, especially &quot;penaeid&quot; shrimps. As such, the district plays an important role in Brunei&#x27;s coastal environment. The estuary, which is made up of deep channels and mudbanks rich in organic matter, receives a lot of freshwater from rivers such as Temburong and Trusan, which causes its salinity levels to fluctuate. Salinity and turbidity are influenced by seasonal rainfall patterns; during intermonsoon times, salinity is low and turbidity is high, and the estuary flushes in two to four days.

== History ==
Brunei was divided in two when Rajah of Sarawak seized the area around the Limbang River in 1890. The British not only took no action to halt the annexation, but they also officially acknowledged its legitimacy. The sultan and the Bruneian court were deeply offended by this, and they are still feeling the pain today. Over the next few years, Brunei was under constant pressure from Sarawak to absorb the entire country. However, Brunei was able to save its independence by defending it with diplomatic missions, letters, and petitions to Britain. Eventually, the North Borneo authorities who wanted Brunei to stay as a buffer state between itself and Sarawak helped them with this.

In 1919, the government funded a public works program to construct bridle paths, connecting rubber estates in Temburong with those near the capital at Gadong and Berakas.

With the building of four bridges in the 10th National Development Plan (RKN), Temburong increased connectivity. Two of the projects are particularly noteworthy since one of them, the Pandaruan Bridge, crosses the Pandaruan River to connect with Limbang, Malaysia. The biggest project is the Temburong Bridge (present day Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien Bridge), which would span the Brunei Bay to link the district with the mainland.

== Administration ==
The district is administered by the Temburong District Office (), a government department under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The district is subdivided into 5 mukims, namely:

These are further subdivided into 76 Kampongs (Villages).

According to the Constitution, the district is to be represented in the Legislative Council, the state legislature, by up to 2 members. As of 2023, one member has been appointed to represent the district in the legislature.

== Demographics ==
The indigenous language of Murut, also called Lun Bawang, is mainly spoken in Temburong District. In 2021, Temburong District had a population of 9,444 people, with 5,031 males and 4,413 females. There were 2,056 households and 1,892 occupied living quarters in the district. This reflects a slight population increase from 2011, when the district had 8,852 people.

==Transportation==
===Road===

The RKN 2007-2012, which allocates over $600 million for highway projects, road building, paving, maintenance, and resurfacing, shows the government&#x27;s continued investment in road development. There were 2,972.11 kilometers of state, district, and military highways in Brunei as of 2008. In addition to studies for additional road and bridge links between Brunei–Muara and Temburong, the plan calls for infrastructure upgrades in the Temburong District, including correcting earth slips, modernising high-density roadways, replacing wooden bridges, and rehabilitating important highways.

The Pandaruan Bridge, a five-lane bridge that span the Pandaruan River and form part of Brunei&#x27;s border with Sarawak, is expected to be completed in a year. It alleviated the ferry bottlenecks and include approach ramps and connecting roads to Temburong and Limbang. This long-awaited land link between mainland Brunei and the exclave of Temburong was created in 2020 with the opening of the Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien Bridge across Brunei Bay. The drive from Bandar Seri Begawan was reduced by 75%, from two or more hours (via Sarawak, requiring four international passport checks) to approximately thirty minutes.

===Water===
Brunei Bay and Malaysia divide Temburong from the rest of the country. As a result, until 2020, the only ways for Bruneians to go to the capital or other regions are by boat or by entering Malaysia. On 19 June 2008, work on the Pekan Bangar Boat Terminal got underway, and it was finished on 19 December 2009. The Minister of Communications, Abu Bakar Apong, formally opened the terminal on 7 January 2010. This terminal was constructed as part of the RKN at an approximate cost of $1.4 million.

==Economy==
=== Agriculture ===

As part of its economic diversification, Brunei has prioritised agriculture, which has led to significant development. With $131.6 million from cattle, $41.35 million from crops, and $52.53 million from agri-food, the agricultural industry brought in over $200 million in 2008, almost double its 1999 earnings. The &quot;Beras Laila&quot; rice type, which is high in protein, low in carbs, and able to be harvested twice a year, strengthened food security and proved to be a success for the paddy plantation industry. 

Three primary locations have been designated for paddy production in Temburong District: Senukoh (80 hectares), Selapon (150 hectares), and Lakiun–Perdayan (700 hectares). With 382.4 hectares and 264.52 metric tons of rice produced annually, Temburong was the second-largest paddy plantation area in Brunei by 2008. Varieties grown there included Adan, Bario, Pusu, and Laila. To further enhance the district&#x27;s agricultural potential, 1,852.76 hectares in Temburong have been set aside for agricultural development in places like Labu Estate, Selapon, Senukoh, Lakiun, Semabat, and Kampong Puni.

In 2022, Temburong District had a total of 2,063.17 hectares designated as agricultural development areas. Of this, 265.92 hectares were allocated to farmers, while 611.25 hectares were used for stations or other purposes. A total of 2,063.17 hectares of land were designated as Agricultural Development Areas (KKP). Of this, 265.92 hectares were awarded to farmers, while 611.25 hectares were allocated for stations or other uses. The primary agricultural activities include fruit cultivation, paddy farming, and integrated crops. Key areas such as KKP Labu Estate focus on fruits, vegetables, and broiler farming, while KKP Selapon and Senukoh areas are dedicated to both fruits and paddy cultivation. Several agricultural stations are also established, including in Perdayan and Puni.

=== Agrifood ===
The government wants to expand sales in the agri-food sector by 512% to $340 million by 2015 from $52.53 million in 2008. 450 ducks may currently be raised on the 0.7 acre Hazeeyah Agro Farm in Temburong, which is run by Nur Haziyah Abdul Rahman and her husband Muhd Hazim Abdul Rahim Mangkiling. The farm began in 2015 with 12 ducks.

In 2022, 78.51 hectares of land are allocated for livestock activities. This includes areas for broiler (chicken meat) production (2.2 hectares), buffalo farming (31.07 hectares), cattle farming (28.17 hectares), and smaller allocations for goats (5.6 hectares), deer (1.7 hectares), and sheep (6.65 hectares). Additionally, there are 3.12 hectares used for miscellaneous livestock, but no land allocated for egg production or slaughtering centers.

=== Forestry ===

The greatest concentration of mangrove timber in Brunei is found in the Temburong District, where important species including &quot;Bruguiera&quot;, &quot;Xylocarpus&quot;, and &quot;Rhizophora apiculata&quot; are found. There is an increasing supply of mangrove timber projected for the Selirong and Labu Forest Reserves, where timber production is a significant activity. The need for firewood and charcoal is predicted to decrease, but the demand for goods like heaps and poles is anticipated to increase. Depletion of mangrove resources is not projected despite predicted increases in demand; nonetheless, in order to maintain long-term conservation and utilisation, a sustainable mangrove forest management plan is advised. Despite extensive clearing, the district&#x27;s mangrove forests—especially in Selirong and Labu—still include sizable tracts of unbroken old-growth forest. Selirong has 1,458 hectares of old-growth forest, compared to 3,140.6 hectares in the Labu forest. Despite being unreachable by water, these regions are home to important species that produce lumber, such as &quot;Xylocarpus spp.&quot; and &quot;Rhizophora apiculata&quot;.

=== Fisheries ===
A prawn farm was established on a 1,000 acre site at Biang on the Temburong River as part of efforts to boost fisheries development; however, it eventually failed commercially owing to issues with water quality control, management, and labor shortages. Large-scale activities have been hampered by the absence of local knowledge, even with government assistance in the form of infrastructure, hatcheries, and fishing cooperatives.

=== Quarrying ===
The district is renowned for its industrial quarry site. This region is home to various quarry industries. Temburong District, a top producer of high-quality stones, manufactures interlocking paving blocks in addition to providing a steady and enough supply of aggregates for sale and usage in road building. It also makes ready-mixed concrete and asphalt premix.

== Development ==

Constructed for about $9.9 million, the Pengiran Isteri Hajah Mariam Hospital is the primary referral facility. Furthermore, Kampong Labu Estate and Kampong Amo are home to two health clinics, and the Flying Doctor Service provides medical care to places that are inaccessible by road or water. In addition, the district contains 13 elementary schools, including both public and private ones, and one secondary school, named Sultan Hassan Secondary School. This indicates that educational facilities have been expanded to accommodate the increasing population.

Since the 1950s, the Bruneian government has ensured that its population with the National Housing Programme. This was followed by a number of additional schemes, including the Infill Scheme (IS), Temporary Occupation-of-Land License (TOL), and Landless Indigenous Citizens Housing Scheme (STKRJ). The Kampung Rataie Landless Indigenous Citizens Housing Scheme and Rataie National Housing Scheme, together with five Iban longhouses (Kampong Sibut, Kampong Sumbiling Baru, Kampong Semabat, Kampong Amo, and Kampong Lepong Baru) are among the housing efforts in Temburong District.

In order to keep up with the increasing demand for clean water, the Sumbiling Water Treatment Plant is scheduled for renovation and expansion. Bangar Town will also receive a new sewage system, as it does not yet have a centralised network. The RKN 8 covers growing power demands estimated for the 2007–2012 period, with peak demand reaching 454 megawatts by the end of 2005. It also includes drainage improvements in the district. Although gas is the primary fuel used to generate energy, a new $4 million power station with a 2.56 megawatt capacity has been erected in Kampong Belingos, Temburong, and plans are in place to expand it by adding two 3-megawatt diesel generators. In addition, there are plans to add ten additional street lights to the district and link Temburong&#x27;s network with the Brunei–Muara and Berakas Power Management Company networks.

== Tourism ==

=== Commerce ===

Popular regional dishes include the highly sought-after &quot;Udang Galah&quot; (King Prawn) in Temburong, the steamed rice dish &quot;Wajid Temburong&quot; (wrapped in &quot;phacelophrynium&quot; (&quot;Nyirik&quot;) leaves and served with sugar and coconut milk), and the refreshingly sweet and green Cendol Temburong, a dessert composed of rice grains. Government resthouses, executive houses like Teratak Madu and Teratak Semala, chalets like Tanjong Bungar Longhouse and Kampong Puni, and homestays like Tanjong Pungar Longhouse are among the lodging choices in Temburong. Bangar Town shopping offers a variety of retail establishments as well as the Bumiputera Main Complex, which has souvenir shops, food stores, handicrafts, and more. For a sample of the local cuisine, visit Tamu Muhibah Aneka Selera Pekan Bangar, a dry market across from the Youth Center in Bangar Town.

=== Landmarks ===

The Temburong District has a number of noteworthy locations. The ancient rubber processing gear is kept in Kampong Labu Estate, a former significant rubber plantation. Taman Aie Tenub, named after the creek that runs through it (meaning &quot;cold water park&quot; in a combination of Malay, Iban, and Murut), is a perfect place for picnics in verdant surroundings. It is situated in Kampong Selapon. Reachable by driving in 10 to 20 minutes, the Temburong Longhouses in southern Temburong provide a full picture of Iban ethnic life, with many residences under one roof and a Head of the House known as a &quot;Tuai Rumah.&quot; In Kampong Senukoh, Wasai Deraya Rimba and Wasai Deraya Belukar offer serene swimming areas with miniature waterfalls, while Arca Taman Gemilang 60 honors Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah&#x27;s 60th birthday.

=== Recreation ===
With a canopy walkway rising to a height of 250 meters, Ulu Temburong National Park, which covers an area of more than 500 square kilometers, offers panoramic view of one of the oldest rainforests. A little mangrove island to the north called Selirong Island, with its bright tropical ecology and morning mist, provides a magical experience. Situated in the eastern region of Temburong, Bukit Patoi Recreational Park boasts a 300-meter wooden walk that ascends to a 310-meter hill that offers views across the Lawas Basin. 13 kilometers from Bangar Town, Batang Duri Recreational Park has a mini-zoo with native animals and river wading.

== Awards ==
In 2009, Temburong District was recognised for the first Excellent Village medal, where the Village Consultative Council (MPK) of Belais and Buda-Buda won a bronze medal for their efforts related to fishing, heritage and recreational parks, farming of chicken, mushroom cultivation, and food production. The MPK Sibut was also given a certificate of appreciation.

<doc id="938065" wikidata="Q7293294" url="?curid=938065" title="Ranking member">
<text>In United States politics, a ranking member is the most senior member of a congressional or state legislative committee from the minority party. On many committees the ranking minority member, along with the Chair, serve as &quot;ex officio&quot; members of all of the committee&#x27;s subcommittees.

Both the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives use ranking members as part of their legislative structure.

When party control of a legislative chamber changes, a committee&#x27;s ranking minority member is generally ensured to become the next chairman of the committee, and vice versa.

==Congressional usage==
Four Senate committees refer to the ranking minority member as vice chairman. The following committees follow the chairman/vice chairman structure for the majority and minority parties.

*Senate Committee on Appropriations
*Senate Committee on Indian Affairs
*Senate Select Committee on Ethics
*Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Other Senate committees refer to the ranking minority members as ranking member.

The House of Representatives normally does not use the term vice chairman for the ranking minority member, though some committees do have a vice-chairman position, usually assigned to a senior member of the majority party other than the chairman. House committees that follow this structure are:

*House Committee on Agriculture
*House Committee on Appropriations
*House Committee on the Budget
*House Committee on Education and the Workforce
*House Committee on Energy and Commerce
*House Committee on Financial Services
*House Committee on Government Reform
*House Committee on Foreign Affairs
*House Committee on Resources
*House Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs
*House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (subcommittees only)

The position of vice chair as the designation for the ranking minority member has been used for the House January 6 Committee.

Joint committees of the House and Senate operate in much the same way, with a chairman and vice-chairman from the majority party, alternating between a member of the House and a member of the Senate, and often two ranking members from both bodies.

<doc id="938068" wikidata="Q7303634" url="?curid=938068" title="Red Ames">
<text>Leon Kessling &quot;Red&quot; Ames (August 2, 1882 – October 8, 1936) was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1903 to 1919 for the New York Giants, Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals, and Philadelphia Phillies. Listed at and , he threw right-handed and was a switch hitter.

==Major league career==
Born in Warren, Ohio, Ames was a third or fourth starter for the New York Giants during their early period of dominance under John McGraw. He made his debut on September 14, 1903, pitching an abbreviated five-inning no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals (the game was called due to darkness), but was not in the rotation full-time until 1905, when his 22 wins and 2.74 ERA helped the Giants to their first twentieth-century world championship. This was by far his best season; although the Giants were perennial contenders during this time, injury and wildness kept him from becoming a star even though he was the Opening Day pitcher three years running. A career ERA of 2.63 ties him with Cy Young.

He pitched in three World Series with the Giants (1905, 1911, 1912), but appeared almost entirely in relief in the fall classic, starting only once, the last game in 1911, which he lost decisively to the world champion Philadelphia Athletics. He was traded to the Reds in 1913, and never again approached his earlier success with the Giants.

Ames&#x27; greatest distinction was being one of the wildest pitchers in history with a curveball charitably described as &quot;dramatic.&quot; Other of his notable accomplishments are leading the National League in saves with six in 1914 and eight in 1916, and in strikeouts per nine innings pitched in 1905 (6.78), 1906 (6.90) and 1907 (5.63).

On Opening Day, April 15, 1909, he held the Brooklyn Superbas hitless for nine innings, but as neither team had scored, extra innings were required. Ames allowed a hit in the 10th inning, then went on to allow three runs in the 13th inning, as the Giants lost, 3–0. Such efforts were originally recognized as no-hitters (as no hits were allowed through nine innings), but since 1991 are no longer recognized by Major League Baseball. This nonetheless remains the longest outing by a Giants starting pitcher on Opening Day.

Ames, Lee Meadows and Bill Doak were involved in a car accident on April 16, 1919, when the car they were in crashed into a streetcar in St. Louis. Initial reports indicated that none were seriously injured.

==Later years==
After leaving the majors, Ames pitched in the minor leagues for three more years and managed briefly in the minors in 1923. His son, Leon Kessling &quot;Red&quot; Ames Jr., played for Ohio State in 1927 and then in the farm system of the Pittsburgh Pirates for several years.

<text>A cartogram (also called a value-area map or an anamorphic map, the latter common among German-speakers) is a thematic map of a set of features (countries, provinces, etc.), in which their geographic size is altered to be directly proportional to a selected variable, such as travel time, population, or gross national income. Geographic space itself is thus warped, sometimes extremely, in order to visualize the distribution of the variable. It is one of the most abstract types of map; in fact, some forms may more properly be called diagrams. They are primarily used to display emphasis and for analysis as nomographs.

Cartograms leverage the fact that size is the most intuitive visual variable for representing a total amount. In this, it is a strategy that is similar to proportional symbol maps, which scale point features, and many flow maps, which scale the weight of linear features. However, these two techniques only scale the map symbol, not space itself; a map that stretches the length of linear features is considered a linear cartogram (although additional flow map techniques may be added). Once constructed, cartograms are often used as a base for other thematic mapping techniques to visualize additional variables, such as choropleth mapping.

==History==

The cartogram was developed later than other types of thematic maps, but followed the same tradition of innovation in France. The earliest known cartogram was published in 1876 by French statistician and geographer Pierre Émile Levasseur, who created a series of maps that represented the countries of Europe as squares, sized according to a variable and arranged in their general geographical position (with separate maps scaled by area, population, religious adherents, and national budget). Later reviewers have called his figures a statistical diagram rather than a map, but Levasseur referred to it as a &quot;carte figurative&quot;, the common term then in use for any thematic map. He produced them as teaching aids, immediately recognizing the intuitive power of size as a visual variable: &quot;It is impossible that the child is not struck by the importance of the trade of Western Europe in relation to that of Eastern Europe, that he does not notice how much England, which has a small territory but outweighs other nations by its wealth and especially by its navy, how much on the contrary Russia which, by its area and its population occupies the first rank, is still left behind by other nations in the commerce and navigation.&quot;

Levasseur&#x27;s technique does not appear to have been adopted by others, and relatively few similar maps appear for many years. The next notable development was a pair of maps by Hermann Haack and Hugo Weichel of the 1898 election results for the German Reichstag in preparation for the 1903 election, the earliest known &quot;contiguous cartogram&quot;. Both maps showed a similar outline of the German Empire, with one subdivided into constituencies to scale, and the other distorting the constituencies by area. The subsequent expansion of densely populated areas around Berlin, Hamburg, and Saxony was intended to visualize the controversial tendency of the mainly urban Social Democrats to win the popular vote, while the mainly rural Zentrum won more seats (thus presaging the modern popularity of cartograms for showing the same tendencies in recent elections in the United States).

The continuous cartogram emerged soon after in the United States, where a variety appeared in the popular media after 1911. Most were rather crudely drawn compared to Haack and Weichel, with the exception of the &quot;rectangular statistical cartograms&quot; by the American master cartographer Erwin Raisz, who claimed to have invented the technique.

When Haack and Weichel referred to their map as a &quot;kartogramm&quot;, this term was commonly being used to refer to all thematic maps, especially in Europe. It was not until Raisz and other academic cartographers stated their preference for a restricted use of the term in their textbooks (Raisz initially espousing &quot;value-area cartogram&quot;) that the current meaning was gradually adopted.

The primary challenge of cartograms has always been the drafting of the distorted shapes, making them a prime target for computer automation. Waldo R. Tobler developed one of the first algorithms in 1963, based on a strategy of warping space itself rather than the distinct districts. Since then, a wide variety of algorithms have been developed (see below), although it is still common to craft cartograms manually.

== General principles ==
Since the early days of the academic study of cartograms, they have been compared to map projections in many ways, in that both methods transform (and thus distort) space itself. The goal of designing a cartogram or a map projection is therefore to represent one or more aspects of geographic phenomena as accurately as possible, while minimizing the collateral damage of distortion in other aspects. In the case of cartograms, by scaling features to have a size proportional to a variable other than their actual size, the danger is that the features will be distorted to the degree that they are no longer recognizable to map readers, making them less useful.

As with map projections, the tradeoffs inherent in cartograms have led to a wide variety of strategies, including manual methods and dozens of computer algorithms that produce very different results from the same source data. The quality of each type of cartogram is typically judged on how accurately it scales each feature, as well as on how (and how well) it attempts to preserve some form of recognizability in the features, usually in two aspects: shape and topological relationship (i.e., retained adjacency of neighboring features). It is likely impossible to preserve both of these, so some cartogram methods attempt to preserve one at the expense of the other, some attempt a compromise solution of balancing the distortion of both, and other methods do not attempt to preserve either one, sacrificing all recognizability to achieve another goal.

== Area cartograms ==

The area cartogram is by far the most common form; it scales a set of region features, usually administrative districts such as counties or countries, such that the area of each district is directly proportional to a given variable. Usually this variable represents the total count or amount of something, such as total Population, Gross domestic product, or the number of retail outlets of a given brand or type. Other strictly positive ratio variables can also be used, such as GDP per capita or Birth rate, but these can sometimes produce misleading results because of the natural tendency to interpret size as total amount. Of these, total population is probably the most common variable, sometimes called an &quot;isodemographic map&quot;.

The various strategies and algorithms have been classified a number of ways, generally according to their strategies with respect to preserving shape and topology. Those that preserve shape are sometimes called &quot;equiform&quot;, although &quot;isomorphic&quot; (same-shape) or &quot;homomorphic&quot; (similar-shape) may be better terms. Three broad categories are widely accepted: contiguous (preserve topology, distort shape), non-contiguous (preserve shape, distort topology), and diagrammatic (distort both). Recently, more thorough taxonomies by Nusrat and Kobourov, Markowska, and others have built on this basic framework in an attempt to capture the variety in approaches that have been proposed and in the appearances of the results. The various taxonomies tend to agree on the following general types of area cartograms.

===Anamorphic Projection===

This is a type of contiguous cartogram that uses a single parametric mathematical formula (such as a polynomial curved surface) to distort space itself to equalize the spatial distribution of the chosen variable, rather than distorting the individual features. Because of this distinction, some have preferred to call the result a &quot;pseudo-cartogram&quot;. Tobler&#x27;s first computer cartogram algorithm was based on this strategy, for which he developed the general mathematical construct on which his and subsequent algorithms are based. This approach first models the distribution of the chosen variable as a continuous density function (usually using a least squares fitting), then uses the inverse of that function to adjust the space such that the density is equalized. The Gastner-Newman algorithm, one of the most popular tools used today, is a more advanced version of this approach. Because they do not directly scale the districts, there is no guarantee that the area of each district is exactly equal to its value.

===Shape-warping contiguous cartograms===

Also called &quot;irregular cartograms&quot; or &quot;deformation cartograms&quot;, This is a family of very different algorithms that scale and deform the shape of each district while maintaining adjacent edges. This approach has its roots in the early 20th Century cartograms of Haack and Weichel and others, although these were rarely as mathematically precise as current computerized versions. The variety of approaches that have been proposed include cellular automata, quadtree partitions, cartographic generalization, medial axes, spring-like forces, and simulations of inflation and deflation. Some attempt to preserve some semblance of the original shape (and may thus be termed &quot;homomorphic&quot;), but these are often more complex and slower algorithms than those that severely distort shape.

===Non-contiguous isomorphic cartograms===

This is perhaps the simplest method for constructing a cartogram, in which each district is simply reduced or enlarged in size according to the variable without altering its shape at all. In most cases, a second step adjusts the location of each shape to reduce gaps and overlaps between the shapes, but their boundaries are not actually adjacent. While the preservation of shape is a prime advantage of this approach, the results often have a haphazard appearance because the individual districts do not fit together well.

===Diagrammatic (Dorling) cartograms===

In this approach, each district is replaced with a simple geometric shape of proportional size. Thus, the original shape is completely eliminated, and contiguity may be retained in a limited form or not at all. Although they are usually referred to as &quot;Dorling cartograms&quot; after Daniel Dorling&#x27;s 1996 algorithm first facilitated their construction, these are actually the original form of cartogram, dating back to Levasseur (1876) and Raisz (1934). Several options are available for the geometric shapes:
* Circles (Dorling), typically brought together to be touching and arranged to retain some semblance of the overall shape of the original space. These often look like proportional symbol maps, and some consider them to be a hybrid between the two types of thematic map.
* Squares (Levasseur/Demers), treated in much the same way as the circles, although they do not generally fit together as simply.
* Rectangles (Raisz), in which the height and width of each rectangular district is adjusted to fit within an overall shape. The result looks much like a treemap diagram, although the latter is generally sorted by size rather than geography. These are often contiguous, although the contiguity may be illusory because many of the districts that are adjacent in the map may not be the same as those that are adjacent in reality.

Because the districts are not at all recognizable, this approach is most useful and popular for situations in which the shapes would not be familiar to map readers anyway (e.g., U.K. parliamentary constituencies) or where the districts are so familiar to map readers that their general distribution is sufficient information to recognize them (e.g., countries of the world). Typically, this method is used when it is more important for readers to ascertain the overall geographic pattern than to identify particular districts; if identification is needed, the individual geometric shapes are often labeled.

===Mosaic cartograms===

In this approach (also called &quot;block&quot; or &quot;regular cartograms&quot;), each shape is not just scaled or warped, but is reconstructed from a discrete tessellation of space, usually into squares or hexagons. Each cell of the tessellation represents a constant value of the variable (e.g., 5000 residents), so the number of whole cells to be occupied can be calculated (although rounding error often means that the final area is not exactly proportional to the variable). Then a shape is assembled from those cells, usually with some attempt to retain the original shape, including salient features such as panhandles that aid recognition (for example, Long Island and Cape Cod are often exaggerated). Thus, these cartograms are usually homomorphic and at least partially contiguous.

This method works best with variables that are already measured as a relatively low-valued integer, enabling a one-to-one match with the cells. This has made them very popular for visualizing the United States Electoral College that determines the election of the president, appearing on television coverage and numerous vote-tracking websites. Several examples of block cartograms were published during the 2016 U.S. presidential election season by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; blog, and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, among others. This is a cartogram for the 2024 and 2028 elections, based on the 2020 Census apportionment:

The major disadvantage of this type of cartogram has traditionally been that they had to be constructed manually, but recently algorithms have been developed to automatically generate both square and hexagonal mosaic cartograms.

== Linear cartograms ==

While an area cartogram manipulates the area of a polygon feature, a linear cartogram manipulates linear distance on a line feature. The spatial distortion allows the map reader to easily visualize intangible concepts such as travel time and connectivity on a network. Distance cartograms are also useful for comparing such concepts among different geographic features. A distance cartogram may also be called a &quot;central-point cartogram&quot;.

A common use of distance cartograms is to show the relative travel times and directions from vertices in a network. For example, on a distance cartogram showing travel time between cities, the less time required to get from one city to another, the shorter the distance on the cartogram will be. When it takes a longer time to travel between two cities, they will be shown as further apart in the cartogram, even if they are physically close together.

Distance cartograms are also used to show connectivity. This is common on subway and metro maps, where stations and stops are shown as being the same distance apart on the map even though the true distance varies. Though the exact time and distance from one location to another is distorted, these cartograms are still useful for travel and analysis.

== Multivariate cartograms ==
Both area and linear cartograms adjust the base geometry of the map, but neither has any requirements for how each feature is symbolized. This means that symbology can be used to represent a second variable using a different type of thematic mapping technique. For linear cartograms, line width can be scaled as a flow map to represent a variable such as traffic volume. For area cartograms, it is very common to fill each district with a color as a choropleth map. For example, WorldMapper has used this technique to map topics relating to global social issues, such as poverty or malnutrition; a cartogram based on total population is combined with a choropleth of a socioeconomic variable, giving readers a clear visualization of the number of people living in underprivileged conditions.

Another option for diagrammatic cartograms is to subdivide the shapes as charts (commonly a pie chart), in the same fashion often done with proportional symbol maps. This can be very effective for showing complex variables such as population composition, but can be overwhelming if there are a large number of symbols or if the individual symbols are very small.

== Production ==
One of the first cartographers to generate cartograms with the aid of computer visualization was Waldo Tobler of UC Santa Barbara in the 1960s. Prior to Tobler&#x27;s work, cartograms were created by hand (as they occasionally still are). The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis located on the UCSB campus maintains an online Cartogram Central with resources regarding cartograms.

A number of software packages generate cartograms. Most of the available cartogram generation tools work in conjunction with other GIS software tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of cartogram software include ScapeToad, Cart, and the Cartogram Processing Tool (an ArcScript for ESRI&#x27;s ArcGIS), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm. An alternative algorithm, Carto3F, is also implemented as an independent program for non-commercial use on Windows platforms. This program also provides an optimization to the original Dougenik rubber-sheet algorithm.

The CRAN package recmap provides an implementation of a rectangular cartogram algorithm.

<text>Cian O&#x27;Connor (born 12 November 1979) is an Irish equestrian competing in show jumping. He has competed at four Olympic Games, four World Championships and six European Championships.

O&#x27;Connor was stripped of the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics when his horse was found to have a banned substance in its system. O&#x27;Connor returned to the Olympics in 2012, receiving the bronze medal in the individual showjumping event. At the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics, O&#x27;Connor withdrew his mount Kilkenny after the horse suffered a nosebleed during their round.

Cian was a member of the Irish Teams that won the Aga Khan Trophy at the Dublin Horse show in 2004, 2012, 2015 and 2022.

O’Connor was also a member of the winning Irish team at the European Show Jumping Championships in 2017, where he placed third in the individual competition.

As part of the Irish World Championships team in Herning 2022, O&#x27;Connor qualified for the Paris Olympic Games in 2024.

== Major results ==

===2004 Summer Olympics===

Riding Waterford Crystal, O&#x27;Connor placed first in the individual jumping competition, earning Ireland&#x27;s only gold medal. However, on 8 October 2004, it emerged that Waterford Crystal had tested positive for a prohibited substance. The Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) ruled that O&#x27;Connor must be stripped of his medal and he also received a three-month ban from competition. FEI found that he did not deliberately attempt to affect the performance of the horse. The individual showjumping gold medal went to Brazilian Rodrigo Pessoa and the Irish team&#x27;s seventh place was inherited by the Italians.

===2012 Summer Olympics===
O&#x27;Connor won the bronze medal in London with his horse Blue Loyd 12 in individual jumping. He lost to Gerco Schröder of the Netherlands in a Silver medal jump-off.

===2020 Summer Olympics===

O&#x27;Connor rode to seventh place with Kilkenny at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (celebrated in 2021), but withdrew after his horse suffered a nosebleed during their round. Blood became visible from the horse&#x27;s nostrils three-quarters into their jumping round, and due to the horse&#x27;s grey colouring, it was visible to spectators on the event&#x27;s live stream. The appearance of blood from the nostrils was not in violation of the FEI&#x27;s blood rule, however, out of an abundance of caution, O&#x27;Connor withdrew from the remaining team competition.

<text>Capital South Wales is a regional radio station owned by Communicorp UK and operated by Global as part of the Capital network. It broadcasts to Cardiff and Newport and the surrounding areas from studios in Cardiff Bay.

==History==
The station originally took to the air in Cardiff only. Known as CBC (Cardiff Broadcasting Company), the station launched on 11 April 1980 on broadcasting on FM and AM. Following the closure of neighbouring Gwent Broadcasting in April 1985, CBC began relaying its service as a temporary measure to southern Gwent on FM and AM. This became permanent when CBC re-launched as Red Dragon Radio on 14 October 1985. Initially, there were separate drive time shows for Glamorgan and Gwent, but these were dropped for a single service by the early 1990s.

Simulcasting on and AM ended in 1990, with the launch of Touch AM.

On 3 January 2011, the station was rebranded from Red Dragon FM to Capital South Wales as part of a merger of owners Global&#x27;s Hit Music and Galaxy networks to form the Capital FM network. On 6 February 2014, Global Radio announced it would be selling Capital South Wales to Communicorp. Capital&#x27;s network programming and brand name are retained under a franchise agreement. Global&#x27;s Heart South Wales station shares facilities at the Capital studios in Cardiff Bay.

On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed the station&#x27;s local breakfast and weekend shows would be replaced with networked programming from April 2019. The weekday drivetime show was retained alongside news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

In January 2025, it was reported that Capital Cymru would cease all of its Welsh language programming following the broadcast regulator Ofcom&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations for commercial radio, apart from news. The station&#x27;s Wrexham studios will also close.

As of 24 February 2025, the station&#x27;s weekday Drivetime show, presented by Josh Andrews and Kally Davies, is simulcast on Capital&#x27;s stations in the North West and North Wales. Separate local news and traffic bulletins for South Wales were retained.

==Coverage area==
Initially, CBC broadcast to Cardiff on and Newport on FM. These frequencies were switched to and respectively in 1987, following a national reorganisation of UK FM frequencies.

The signal, which is the stronger of the two, comes from the transmitter at Wenallt near Cardiff, with the signal being transmitted from Christchurch in Newport. The signals reach as far out as the South Wales Valleys to the north and part of Bridgend to the west.

Capital South Wales also broadcasts on the NOW Digital South East Wales DAB multiplex and online.

==Programming==
All networked programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot;. Local programming is produced and broadcast from Global&#x27;s Cardiff Bay studios from 4-7pm, presented by Josh Andrews and Kally Davies. 

===News===
Global&#x27;s Newsroom broadcasts hourly regional news updates from 5am-7pm on weekdays and 8am-12 midday at weekends.

The bulletins are produced for Communicorp by Global&#x27;s Cardiff Bay newsroom, which also produces bulletins for Heart South Wales, Heart North and Mid Wales and Smooth Wales.

<text>Paul Heinrich Ritter von Groth (23 June 1843 – 2 December 1927) was a German mineralogist. His most important contribution to science was his systematic classification of minerals based on their chemical compositions and crystal structures.

==Biography==
He was born at Magdeburg, and educated at Freiberg, Dresden and Berlin, and received the doctorate degree in 1868. After lecturing at the Freiberg mining school and at the University of Berlin, in 1872 he became professor of mineralogy at Strasbourg. In 1883, he was appointed professor of mineralogy and curator of minerals in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.

He died in Munich.

==Work==
He carried out extensive research on crystals and minerals, and also on rocks. von Groth published &quot;Tabellarische Übersicht der einfachen Mineralien&quot; (1874-1898) and &quot;Physikalische Krystallographie&quot; (1876-1895, ed. 4, 1905), the latter of which was influential with the acceptance of crystallographic methods in the field of organic chemistry. In 1877 he founded the journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Krystallographie und Mineralogie&quot;, and subsequently served as its editor until 1920. In 1883, Groth compiled a monumental five-volume collection entitled &quot;Chemische Kristallographie,&quot; which contained crystalline morphology and physical property data on thousands of substances.

By Groth&#x27;s time, Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory was already well established. In 1888, Groth was the first to suggest the possibility that spherical atoms reside at equivalent positions of space lattices, which gave a physical significance to this still somewhat abstract idea of the regular and symmetric partitioning of space. The German physicist Leonhard Sohncke (1842–1897) had previously derived the 65 chiral space groups (i.e. those lacking an inversion center, mirror planes, or improper axes of rotation that invert the handedness of a crystal). The mathematical descriptions of the complete set of 230 space groups, including their symmetry elements, were thereafter derived independently by Schönflies, Fedorov, and Barlow. Finally, in 1922, Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff (1897–1994) authored &quot;The Analytical Expression of the Results of the Theory of Space Groups&quot;, a book which contained, among other things, tables with the positional coordinates, both general and special, permitted by the symmetry elements.

<doc id="938078" wikidata="Q327044" url="?curid=938078" title="Operation Northwind (1944)">
<text>Operation Northwind () was the last major German offensive of World War II on the Western Front. Northwind was launched to support the German Ardennes offensive campaign in the Battle of the Bulge, which by late December 1944 had decisively turned against the German forces. It began on 31 December 1944 in Rhineland-Palatinate, Alsace and Lorraine in southwestern Germany and northeastern France, and ended on 25 January 1945. The German offensive was an operational failure, with its main objectives not achieved.

== Objectives ==

By 21 December 1944, the German momentum during the Battle of the Bulge had begun to dissipate, and it was evident that the operation was on the brink of failure. The German high command believed that an attack against the United States Seventh Army further south, which had extended its lines and taken on a defensive posture to cover the area vacated by the United States Third Army which had turned north to assist at the site of the German breakthrough, could relieve pressure on German forces in the Ardennes. In a briefing at his military command complex at Adlerhorst, Adolf Hitler declared in his speech to his division commanders on 28 December 1944 (three days prior to the launch of Operation &quot;Nordwind&quot;), &quot;This attack has a very clear objective, namely the destruction of the enemy forces. There is not a matter of prestige involved here. It is a matter of destroying and exterminating the enemy forces wherever we find them.&quot;

The goal of the offensive was to break through the lines of the U.S. Seventh Army and the French 1st Army in the Upper Vosges Mountains and the Alsatian Plain and destroy them, as well as seize the city of Strasbourg, which Himmler had promised would be captured by 30 January. The achievement of these objectives would pave the way for Operation Dentist (&quot;Unternehmen Zahnarzt&quot;), a planned major thrust into the rear of the U.S. Third Army, intended to lead to the destruction of that army.

== Offensive ==

On 31 December 1944, German Army Group G (commanded by Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz) and Army Group Upper Rhine (commanded by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler) launched a major offensive against the thinly stretched, front line held by the U.S. 7th Army. Operation Nordwind soon had the overextended U.S. 7th Army in dire straits; the 7th Army (at the orders of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower) had sent troops, equipment, and supplies north to reinforce the American armies in the Ardennes involved in the Battle of the Bulge.

On the same day that the German Army launched Operation Nordwind, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German Air Force) committed almost 1,000 aircraft in support. This attempt to cripple the Allied air forces based in northwestern Europe was known as Operation Bodenplatte. It failed without having achieved any of its key objectives.

The initial Nordwind attack was conducted by three corps of the German 1st Army of Army Group G, and by 9 January, the XXXIX (39th) Panzer Corps was heavily engaged as well. By 15 January at least 17 German divisions (including units in the Colmar Pocket) from Army Group G and Army Group Oberrhein, including the 6th SS Mountain, 17th SS Panzergrenadier, 21st Panzer, and 25th Panzergrenadier Divisions were engaged in the fighting. Another smaller attack was made against the French positions south of Strasbourg, but it was finally stopped. The U.S. VI Corps—which bore the brunt of the German attacks—was fighting on three sides by 15 January.

The 125th Regiment of the 21st Panzer Division under Colonel Hans von Luck aimed to sever the American supply line to Strasbourg, by cutting across the eastern foothills of the Vosges at the northwest base of a natural salient in a bend of the River Rhine. Here the Maginot Line, running east–west, was used by Allied forces, and &quot;showed what a superb fortification it was&quot;. On January 7 Luck approached the line south of Wissembourg at the villages of Rittershoffen and Hatten. Heavy American fire came from the 79th Infantry Division, the 14th Armoured Division, plus elements of the 42nd Infantry Division. On January 10 Luck reached the villages. Two weeks of heavy fighting followed, Germans and Americans each occupying parts of the villages while civilians sheltered in cellars. Luck later said that the fighting around Rittershoffen had been &quot;one of the hardest and most costly battles that ever raged&quot;.

Eisenhower, fearing the outright destruction of the U.S. 7th Army, had rushed already battered divisions hurriedly relieved from the Ardennes, southeast over , to reinforce the 7th Army. But their arrival was delayed, and on 21 January with supplies and ammunition short, Seventh Army ordered the much-depleted 79th Infantry and 14th Armored Divisions to retreat from Rittershoffen and fall back on new positions on the south bank of the Moder River.

On 25 January the German offensive was halted, after the U.S. 222nd Infantry Regiment stopped their advance near Haguenau, earning the Presidential Unit Citation in the process. The same day reinforcements began to arrive from the Ardennes. Although Strasbourg had been successfully defended, the Colmar Pocket had not yet been eliminated.

<text>Heart Gloucestershire (formerly Severn Sound) was a British Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Heart network. It broadcast to Gloucestershire from studios in Gloucester.

The transmitter, shared with Radio Gloucestershire, is at Churchdown Hill, just west of the M5.

==History==

Severn Sound started transmissions on 23 October 1980, from its first studio at the &quot;Old Talbot&quot; pub in Southgate Street, Gloucester. The pub had been bought by local businessmen including Clive Lindley, chairman of the Roadchef motorway service stations and of Severn Sound. The station&#x27;s first employee was Chief Engineer Quentin Howard, who converted the pub into the radio station.

The original presenters were Alan Roberts, Head of Music, on Breakfast, Christopher Musk on mid-mornings, Eddie Vickers, Programme Controller, on the Lunchtime News and Topical programme, Laura de Vere on the Afternoon Show and Steve Ellis on Drivetime. There was a Sunday lunchtime show in which the presenter would go to various areas of Gloucester and share Sunday lunch with the residents of a house.

One notable director was the writer Dennis Potter, who played an active role in the station&#x27;s early years and lived in Ross on Wye. Potter&#x27;s &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; producer, Kenith Trodd, presented a Sunday programme of 78 records featuring singers including Al Bowlly, which Todd and Potter had used in &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;. Another director was England rugby player Mike Burton, who also started sports travel agency Gulliver&#x27;s Travels.

On 1 July 1984 two of the station&#x27;s engineers, Nigel Lane and Tony Cooper, were killed on an outside broadcast when the telescopic mast of their radio car touched an overhead 11 kV power line while they were preparing for a live broadcast from Sudeley Castle, Winchcombe. The inquiry into the accident found Severn Sound guilty of health and safety offences and fined the company £2,500. Many new safety procedures for radio cars were introduced across the industry as a result of the accident.

The station was sold to the &quot;Chiltern Radio Group&quot;, after some resistance, in 1989, and was later taken over by the GWR Group in 1995, which merged into GCap Media in 2005, and was sold to Global Radio in 2008.

During the Gloucester/Tewkesbury flood crisis of Summer 2007, Severn Sound was forced to move temporarily to the GWR FM Bristol Studios, due to a loss of electricity and running water.

===Split frequencies===

In 1990, Severn Sound split frequencies, with its 774 kHz AM frequency being renamed Three Counties Radio, expanding to cover Hereford &amp; Worcester. This was an &quot;oldies&quot; station and was a mix of local programmes and networking from Chiltern Radio Network&#x27;s Supergold service. Presenters who moved from Severn Sound to Three Counties included &quot;Tony Peters &amp; Sally Low Hurry&quot;. John Hellings was brought in as breakfast presenter. In 1992, Three Counties Radio was re-branded as Severn Sound Supergold (and no longer promoted in Hereford &amp; Worcester), and was re-branded again, in 1996, by new owners GWR as Severn Sound Classic Gold. Ownership rules required GWR to sell all their Classic Gold licences, to UBC Media, and another re-brand to Classic Gold 774 followed. The heritage name &quot;Severn&quot; is no longer mentioned on 774 AM after it was re-branded again, in 2007, to Gold, and again on 24 March 2014 to Smooth Radio. All programming on 774 AM now comes from London.

===Rebrand===

In September 2008 Severn Sound became Heart Gloucestershire as part of a national re-branding of 29 stations by owners Global Radio.

The &quot;Heart Gloucestershire&quot; branding was launched at 6am on Monday 23 March 2009, with local programming broadcast from the above-the-street &quot;Bridge Studios&quot;, part of the Eastgate Shopping Centre (The Mall) in Gloucester. Local news bulletins on the station are produced by Heart West in Bristol, following the closure of the station&#x27;s Gloucester newsroom in summer 2010.

===Station merger===
In 2019 Heart Gloucestershire merged with three sister stations in Bristol and Somerset, Devon and Cornwall and Wiltshire. From 3 June 2019, local output will became a three-hour regional Drivetime show on weekdays, with local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

Heart Gloucestershire&#x27;s studios in Gloucester closed, with operations moving to Bristol. The station ceased local programming on 31 May 2019. Local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London.

Heart West began broadcasting regional programming on 3 June 2019.

<doc id="938085" wikidata="Q1075050" url="?curid=938085" title="Cuman language">
<text>Cuman or Kuman (also called Kipchak, Qypchaq or Polovtsian, self referred to as Tatar () in Codex Cumanicus) was a West Kipchak Turkic language spoken by the Cumans (Polovtsy, Folban, Vallany, Kun) and Kipchaks; the language was similar to today&#x27;s various languages of the West Kipchak branch. Cuman is documented in medieval works, including the Codex Cumanicus, and in early modern manuscripts, like the notebook of Benedictine monk Johannes ex Grafing. It was a literary language in Central and Eastern Europe that left a rich literary inheritance. The language became the main language (lingua franca) of the Golden Horde.

==History==
The Cumans were nomadic people who lived on the steppes of Eastern Europe, north of the Black Sea, before the Golden Horde. Many Turkic peoples including the Crimean Tatars, Karachays, Kumyks, Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks and Balkars, Manavs are descended from the Cumans. Today, the speakers of these various languages belonging to the Kipchak branch speak variations closely related to the Cuman language.

The literary Cuman language became extinct in the early 18th century in the region of Cumania in Hungary, which was its last stronghold. Tradition holds that the last speaker of the Cuman language in Hungary was István Varró, a resident of Karcag (Hungary) who died in 1770. The Cuman language in Crimea, however, managed to survive. The Cuman language is considered the direct ancestor of the current language of the Crimean Tatars with possible incorporations of the other languages in the region, like Crimean Gothic.

By a preponderance Cumanian population of the Crimea acquired the name &quot;Tatars&quot;, embraced Islam, and retained the Quman-Qipchaq Turkic language, and the process of consolidating the multi-ethnic conglomerate of the Peninsula began, which has led to the emergence of the Crimean Tatar people.

The Cuman-Kipchaks had an important role in the history of Anatolia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Romania (see, for example, the Basarab dynasty), Moldavia, Bessarabia and Bulgaria.

Radlov believed that among the current languages Cuman is closest to the Mishar dialect of the Tatar language.

<text>Delaware, Ontario is a community located about west of and outside of London, Ontario, within Middlesex County. Delaware straddles the Thames River. Delaware is accessed by Highway 2 linking London and Chatham, while the Highway 402 links to Sarnia along with Port Huron and Toronto.

== Education ==
Delaware has two elementary schools, Delaware Central Public School (Thames Valley District School Board), and Our Lady of Lourdes (London District Catholic School Board). Delaware Central (DCPS) has about 175 students, while Our Lady of Lourdes has approximately 350. In the fall of 2011, Our Lady of Lourdes (OLOL) moved to a new facility on Wellington Street, in part this was due to the school being flooded constantly from the nearby creek. After the departure of OLOL the private school Riverbend Academy acquired the property. Riverbend Academy is a co-ed elementary and secondary school offering enrollment from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12.

== Geography ==
Delaware is situated in the Thames River Valley, although it has now expanded over the top of the valley ridge. Most of the area surrounding Delaware is made up of forests and floodplain areas. Corn, soybeans and tobacco are farmed extensively in the area around Delaware, as well as inside the town limits in some areas. Delaware has undergone modest growth in housing over the last 30 years, with the developed area nearly doubling in that time.

Many of the buildings in the heart of Delaware are known to be well into their second century. For example, the fine brick house on the north brow of Wellington St. was built in 1842 by the Tiffanys. Buildings in the village still stand that are seen in Civil War era photographs. These include the building that is now Delaware Variety as well as the antique shop across the street (now the Delaware Pharmacy). Belvoir Manor is a private home that was at one point a seminary and a private school for boys, and at one point was damaged by fire. Belvoir was originally built by Dean Tiffany in 1859 and named Maple Grove, passing in turn to the Gibson family who renamed it Belvoir and pronounced it Beever, then to the Little family, who after the death of Senator Little sold it to the Roman Catholic Church. Belvoir is now a privately owned farm.

== Tourism and entertainment ==
Delaware boasts a number of tourist destinations despite its small size. Delaware Speedway is a half-mile paved race track that is one of the oldest in Canada. The track hosts stock car racing every Friday night during the summer, as well as several Saturday and Sunday race features. The track has also hosted major concert events in the past including I Mother Earth and Matthew Good.

The Longwoods Road Conservation Area features Skah-Nah-Doht, a recreated Iroquoian village complete with longhouses and tours, as well as a museum featuring exhibits of Iroquoian culture and archaeological artifacts. The park hosts a yearly native festival as well as a re-enactment of the Battle of Longwoods.

<doc id="938088" wikidata="Q6963397" url="?curid=938088" title="William Roy">
<text>Major-General William Roy (4 May 17261 July 1790) was a Scottish military engineer, surveyor, and antiquarian. He was an innovator who applied new scientific discoveries and newly emerging technologies to the accurate geodetic mapping of Great Britain. His masterpiece is usually referred to as Roy&#x27;s Map of Scotland.

It was Roy&#x27;s advocacy and leadership that led to the creation of the Ordnance Survey in 1791, the year after his death. His technical work in the establishment of a surveying baseline won him the Copley Medal in 1785. His maps and drawings of Roman archaeological sites in Scotland were the first accurate and systematic study of the subject, and have not been improved upon even today. Roy was a fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

==Life and works==
=== Early life and family ===
Roy was born at Milton Head in Carluke parish in South Lanarkshire on 4 May 1726. His father was a factor in the service of the Gordons/Hamiltons of Hallcraig, as well as an elder of the Kirk. His grandfather had held a similar position as factor, and his uncle acted in that capacity for the Lockharts of Lee. Thus Roy grew up in an environment where making land surveys and using maps was part of the daily business. He was educated in Carluke parish school and then Lanark Grammar School. There is no record of a further education such as that enjoyed by his
younger brother James.

The next few years of his life are poorly documented. Owen and Pilbeam claim
that &quot;Some time after 1738 (when Roy was 12) he moved to Edinburgh and gained experience of surveying and making plans, probably as a civilian draughtsman at the office of the Board of Ordnance at Edinburgh Castle.&quot; It is possible that he may have been employed there as a boy because it was normal procedure for the board to employ &quot;cadets&quot; aged ten or eleven who were trained to become civilian surveyors and draughtsmen. Roy was certainly associated with the board by 1746 (aged 20), for he was the author of an official map of Culloden made soon after the battle.

As an employee of the board he would have come to notice of Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson, Deputy Quartermaster-General of the Military District of North Britain for the board, whose headquarters was in Edinburgh. The terms of Roy&#x27;s employment are unknown but must have some opportunity to undertake private surveys for he was reported as a respected land surveyor employed by the Callander family at their Craigforth estate near Stirling prior to his work for the military.

Roy maintained his connections to his birthplace and the people living there. A servant for the Lockharts of Lee recalled his visits there over time, as his national reputation grew. She noted that at first he would dine in the servants hall, in later years he would dine with the family, and later still he would be seated at the right hand of the Laird.

=== Monument ===

There is a monument to William Roy at the location of his birthplace on Milton Road near Carluke. It is signposted from the junction of Lanark Road and Cartland Avenue. The monument is in the form of a Hotine pillar, a type of trig point. The inscription reads &quot;Here stood Miltonhead the birthplace of Major-General William Roy 4th May 1726 - 30th June 1790 from whose military map of Scotland made in 1747 - 1755 grew the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain&quot;.

==Roy as surveyor and soldier==

===The survey of Scotland ===

In 1747 Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson, Deputy Quartermaster-General, proposed the compilation of a map of the Scottish Highlands following the Jacobite rising of 1745.
In response, King George II commissioned a military survey of the Highlands, and Watson was placed in charge, under the command of the Duke of Cumberland, but it fell to Roy &quot;to begin, and afterwards to have a considerable share in, the execution of that map&quot;, now known as &quot;The Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s Map&quot;.

Roy was without any military rank at this 
time 
but Watson appointed him as an assistant to the quartermaster to provide him some seniority over the group of (typically) six soldiers who travelled with him: an NCO, two end markers, two chainmen and a batman.
From 1749 he was joined by another five junior surveyors for various periods of time: notable among these young assistants were Paul Sandby (born 1731), later renowned for his watercolour landscapes, and a seventeen-year-old David Dundas (born 1735), later Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.

Eventually there were six teams conducting surveys by traverses of the country with the objects to the side of the line recorded by sketches and compass directions. The Highlands were covered by 1752, but the survey was extended to the lowlands for another three years, until 1755, when most of the engineer surveyors were posted to war stations. In the introduction to the 1885 account of the measurement of the Hounslow baseline Roy writes that the map remained &quot;in an unfinished state ... and is to be considered as a magnificent military sketch rather than a very accurate map of a country ... (and) it would have been completed, and many of its imperfections no doubt remedied, but for the breaking out of war in 1755.&quot;
The eighty-four original field sheets and the thirty-eight divisions of the &quot;fair-protraction&quot;are held in the British Museum together with a small index map and a reduced map of the whole country in a single sheet published as &quot;the King&#x27;s map&quot;. It is now possible to view the map online.

===Military appointments===
Throughout the Survey of Scotland, Roy was a civilian assistant to David Watson the deputy quartermaster-general, but in 1755 the survey was terminated by the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War with France and the consequent redeployment of personnel to more pressing posts in both the regular army and the Board of Ordnance. In the same year the engineers of the board were formed into the Corps of Engineers. The board officers were members of both structures, for they would be deployed with the army regiments for specialist duties.

In 1776 Roy was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 53rd Foot, a new regiment formed in 1755. At the same time he was appointed as a practitioner-engineer, the lowest rank in the Board of Ordnance survey department, and ensign in the Corps of Engineers. 
Thereafter Roy was promoted steadily, and rapidly, in both structures, but his army rank was always greater than his board rank. For example, he was lieutenant-colonel in the army by 1762 and director and lieutenant-colonel of the Engineers in 1783. He is best known by his army rank of major-general, which he attained in 1781.

From 1786 to his death in 1790, Roy held the position of Colonel of the 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot.

===Active service===
On the termination of the Scottish survey Roy, now under the jurisdiction of two military bodies, was posted in 1756 to the South of England where he was engaged, together with Watson and Dundas, in inspecting the readiness of coastal military installations in preparation for an expected French invasion. This work involved Roy in the production of plans of fortifications and rough maps of stretches of the south coast: examples are a sketch of the country from Gloucester to Pembroke, with Milford Haven and a sketch of the country betwixt Guildford and Canterbury. These sketches are preserved in the British Library.

By 1757 Roy was with his regiment in France for the Rochefort expedition and then in Germany for the Battle of Minden in 1759. His technical abilities and willingness to innovate brought him to the favourable attention of his commanders. Preparatory to the battle, the various military engineers made drawings of each step of the coming battle, with each step drawn on a different sheet of paper. The commander could then study the course of the battle before it occurred, going from one sheet to the next. Lieutenant Roy, however, made his drawings on a single sheet with coordinated and accurate overlays, so that the commander could more easily study the course of the battle by examining a single sheet of paper. The commander&#x27;s comprehension was greatly facilitated, and Roy&#x27;s methodology was soon adopted as an advancement in military science. Thereafter his promotion was rapid, and by the end of the war in 1763 Roy was a lieutenant colonel in the regiment and director of the engineers of the Board of Ordnance as well as being the deputy quartermaster general for Germany.

===Surveyor-general===

At the conclusion of the war in 1763 Roy returned to London, where he was based for the rest of his life. The threatened French invasion of the south coast had never materialised, but he felt strongly that the reconnaissances he had made with Watson at the outbreak of the war should be extended to a national survey, not just of the vulnerable south but the whole of the British Isles. He never ceased to champion this cause, but the expense of the Seven Years&#x27; War and then the American War of Independence excluded any expenditure on trigonometrical surveys for another twenty years.

In 1765 he was appointed surveyor-general under a royal warrant which directed him &quot;to inspect, survey and make reports from time to time of the state of the coasts of this Kingdom and the islands thereunto belonging.&quot; This work, which took him to many parts of Britain and abroad (Ireland and Gibraltar), is recorded in the many plans and sketch maps of districts that are now lodged at the British Library.

Despite the travel Roy was able to enter fully into the intellectual life of London, and in 1767 he became a fellow of the Royal Society. The only paper he read before the society was in 1783 on &quot;Rules for measuring heights with a barometer&quot;. Roy was promoted to colonel in 1777, and to major-general in 1781. He was in charge of the departments of the Quartermaster-General and Chief Engineer in 1782, and in 1783 became the director of Royal Engineers.

===The Anglo-French survey===

Late in life, when he was 57, Roy was granted the opportunity to establish his lasting reputation in the world of geodesy. The opening came from a completely unexpected direction. In 1783 Cassini de Thury addressed a memoir to the Royal Society in which he expressed grave reservations of the measurements of latitude and longitude which had been undertaken at Greenwich Observatory. He suggested that the correct values might be found by combining the Paris Observatory figures with a precise triangulation (survey) between the two observatories. 
Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, proposed that Roy should lead the project. Roy accepted with enthusiasm for he saw that apart from the specific measurements proposed the survey could be the first step towards the national survey that he had advocated so often. The whole project is described by Roy in three major contributions to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 
1785,
1787 and
1790.
There are shorter accounts of the project in the &quot;History of the Royal Engineers&quot;,
the records of the Royal Society
and in every history of the Ordnance Survey.

After a preliminary survey by Roy and three other members of the Society on 16 April, they found a suitable location for the starting baseline on Hounslow Heath, between King&#x27;s Arbour and Hampton Poor-house just over 5 miles to the south-east. A preliminary measurement of the line was carried out with a steel chain prepared by Jesse Ramsden. It was the intention to measure more accurately with a set of three deal rods about 20 ft. in length but their use had to be abandoned because of their susceptibility to lengthen and shorten in wet weather. The deal rods were replaced by one-inch-thick glass tubes of the same length. The final measurement gives the length of the base as 27404.7 ft. to an accuracy of about 3 inches in 5 miles (or about 1/100,000). The precision of this baseline measurement far exceeded any previous attempts, and in recognition Roy was awarded the Copley medal by the Royal Society in 1785.
The triangulation itself was delayed until 1787 when Ramsden supplied a new theodolite of unsurpassed accuracy: it could measure angles to within one arc second and therefore detect the curvature of the Earth by measuring the 
spherical excess of the triangles of the survey. By the end of that year he had completed measurements at all but two of the trigonometric stations. Many of the measurements, particularly the cross channel sightings, were taken at night using intense flares (handled by the artillery). Others required the placing of the instrument on church towers, or even on scaffolded steeples, and in their absence it was sometimes necessary to use a specially constructed portable tower some 30 feet high.

The final report of 1790 presents figures for the distance between Paris and Greenwich as well as the precise latitude, longitude and height of the British triangulation stations. Throughout the survey Roy took every opportunity to fix the position of as many landmarks as possible and these formed the basis of the topographic surveys from which new maps could be prepared. Roy died when only three pages of his final report remained to be proofed.

===Roy&#x27;s scientific legacy===

Roy&#x27;s use of scientific advancements and accurate mathematical formulae paved the way for modern geodesic surveying. His tenure and his work are the dividing line between older, approximate mappings and newer, highly accurate ones in Britain. He is cited repeatedly in early nineteenth-century mathematics textbooks for his use of spherical trigonometry in surveying. 
Early twentieth-century technical books on modern surveying and geodesy include Roy&#x27;s work as the historical starting point for the modern profession. Perhaps his greatest legacy of all was the work of the Ordnance Survey which commenced in 1791, one year after his death, by extending the basic Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) to the rest of Great Britain over the following sixty years.

==Roy as antiquary==

During the Scottish Survey, Roy took careful note of the locations of ancient Roman remains, primarily military camps, wherever he encountered them and these were all marked precisely on the map sheets. This was the beginning of a lifelong interest in ancient Scottish history which he pursued whenever he was travelling the country in his capacity as Surveyor General. 
Roy&#x27;s maps and his drawings of the relics of the Roman presence in Scotland were immediately seen as credible and valuable. For sites where the Roman remains were later destroyed by human development, his drawings are the only reliable record of their existence.
Roy was the first to systematically map the Antonine Wall and provide accurate and detailed drawings of its remains, an effort undertaken in 1764.

Roy&#x27;s only historical work, &quot;Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain&quot; was published posthumously in 1793. 
This book has a mixed reputation. His drawings and maps are held in the highest regard as still-valuable research sources. However, his efforts in the scholarly discussion of history are widely held to be without value, largely through no fault of his own. This was due to his belief that the spurious text of Charles Bertram &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot; was a genuine work, a view shared by virtually all of his contemporaries. Roy consequently adjusted his perspective to be consistent with the history as told in the fraud, causing his own conclusions to be without a valid foundation. Much of Roy&#x27;s research was devoted to the attempt to follow fictitious journeys throughout Scotland that were described in &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot;.

That Roy&#x27;s considerable talents were partially wasted is a tragedy. He was a Scot with a lifelong interest in ancient Scottish history, and his technical ability and scientific knowledge made him uniquely qualified to provide information in an area of history where knowledge and understanding are minimal. That loss for Scottish history has been bemoaned by Scottish historians. In his introduction to &quot;Celtic Scotland&quot;, Skene deprecates those historical works based on &quot;De Situ&quot;, including Roy&#x27;s, but adds for him alone the comment that &quot; ... perhaps more to be regretted, the valuable work of General Roy ...&quot;

<doc id="938089" wikidata="Q978504" url="?curid=938089" title="Galilaei (lunar crater)">
<text>Galilaei is a lunar impact crater located in the western Oceanus Procellarum. Some distance to the southeast is the crater Reiner, while to the south-southwest is Cavalerius. Northeast of the crater is a meandering rille named the Rima Galilaei. To the southeast is the unusual Reiner Gamma formation, a swirling arrangement of light-hued ray-like material.

Galilaei is relatively undistinguished, with a sharp-edged rim that has a higher albedo than the surrounding maria. The inner walls slope down to a ring of debris on the outer edges of the interior floor. There is a small central rise near the midpoint.

About 40 kilometers to the south is the landing site of the Luna 9 robotic probe, the first such vehicle to make a controlled landing on the lunar surface.

Despite being the first person to publish astronomical observations of the Moon with a telescope, Galileo Galilei is honored only with this unremarkable formation.

Initially, the name Galilaeus had been applied by Giovanni Battista Riccioli, an Italian Jesuit who produced one of the first detailed maps of the Moon in 1651, to a large and bright nearby albedo feature (now known as Reiner Gamma). The name was transferred to its present location by Johann Heinrich Mädler in his influential Mappa Selenographica, published in collaboration with Wilhelm Beer in four parts between 1834 and 1836. Mädler&#x27;s motive for this change was the fact that his lunar map did not name albedo features, forcing him to transfer Galileo&#x27;s name to an insignificant nearby crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Galilaei.

<text>Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan (born 28 November 1969) is an Irish former track and field athlete. She won a gold medal in the 5000 metres at the 1995 World Championships, and a silver medal in the 5000 metres at the 2000 Olympic Games. Her 2000 m world record of 5:25.36, set in 1994 stood until 2017.

O&#x27;Sullivan first came to prominence when winning the 1500 m at the 1991 Universiade, before going on to finish fourth in the 3000 m final at the 1992 Olympic Games. She then won a silver medal in the 1500 m at the 1993 World Championships. She was the favourite for the 5000 m title at the 1996 Olympic Games but dropped out of the final due to illness. As well as her 1995 World title, she won three gold medals at the European Championships, in the 3000 m (1994), 5000 m (1998) and 10,000 m (1998), and is a two-time World Cross Country Champion.

O&#x27;Sullivan won silver medals in the 5000 m and 10,000 m at the 2002 European Championships, and competed at her fourth Olympic Games in 2004. She is known for her dramatic kick, clocking 28-second final 200 m splits in some of her races.

She is one of two women (the other Tirunesh Dibaba) who won the short and long course World Cross Country title at the same championship (1998 in Marrakesh).

== Early career ==

Born in Cobh, County Cork, O&#x27;Sullivan was educated at St Marys National School Cobh and Cobh Community College. She completed her leaving certificate in 1987. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first major international competition was the 1990 European Championships at Split, where she finished 11th in the 3000 m. However, O&#x27;Sullivan improved quickly after that, and on 26 January the following year, at Boston, she set a new world indoor record in the 5000 m of 15:17.28, taking more than 5 seconds off the old record. At the time, O&#x27;Sullivan (who attained a sporting scholarship) was studying accountancy at Villanova University in the US, and at the World Student Games at Sheffield in July 1991, she won the 1500 m gold medal in 4:12.14, and the silver medal in the 3000 m in 8:56.55. At the start of 1992, she finished 7th in the World Cross Country Championships.

She won the Honda Sports Award as the nation&#x27;s top female cross-country runner in 1991–92.

In 1992, O&#x27;Sullivan improved her personal bests in a number of distances between 800 m and 5000 m, setting six Irish national records in the process, including five in the space of 11 days in mid-August following the Barcelona Olympic Games. At Barcelona, in the 3000 m final, O&#x27;Sullivan was always in contention and hit the lead in the back straight on the final lap, but she was eventually outsprinted and finished fourth. Narrowly missing out on an Olympic medal was made all the more frustrating when the silver medalist from the race Tatyana Dorovskikh tested positive for a banned substance the following year. In the 1500 m, she finished only 11th in her semi-final and did not qualify for the final. She finished 1992 by winning the Grand Prix Final for the 5000 m.

== 1993–1995 ==

=== 1993 ===

In 1993, O&#x27;Sullivan established herself as one of the world&#x27;s top middle-distance runners. By the time the World Championships came around, she was the clear favourite for both the 3000 m and 1500 m. However her hopes in the 3000 m were dashed by the performances of three Chinese athletes who would later in the year go on to smash the world record multiple times. The winner, Qu Yunxia, finished in a championship record of 8:28.71, with Zhang Linli and Zhang Lirong following in second and third respectively. A month later Qu would go on to set a 1500 m world record of 3:50.46. O&#x27;Sullivan finished the race 4th in a time of 8:33.8. Six days later she won the silver medal in the 1500 m in a time of 4:03.48, again behind a Chinese athlete. Five days after the championships, at the ISTAF meet in Berlin, O&#x27;Sullivan recorded the season&#x27;s best time over 5000 m of 14:45.92, which moved her to third on the all-time world list. Soon afterwards she closed the year by winning the Grand Prix Final for the 3000 m and finished 2nd in the Mile. She finished the Grand Prix season in 2nd place in the Women&#x27;s Overall competition.

=== 1994 ===

During 1994, O&#x27;Sullivan dominated international distance running. She set the fastest time of the year in four events, the 1500 m, 1 mile, 2000 m and 3000 m, and the second fastest time in the 5000 m. On 8 July, at Edinburgh, she broke the 2000 m world record, setting a new time of 5:25.36. This record stood until Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia broke it on 7 February 2017. The next week, in London, she broke the European record for the 3000 m, beating Britain&#x27;s Yvonne Murray, and setting the year&#x27;s fastest time of 8:21.64. This moved her to fifth on the all-time world list, behind the four Chinese runners who had set their personal bests at the 1993 National Championships in Beijing. This record lasted until 2002, when Gabriela Szabo bettered it. Only three days later, at Nice, O&#x27;Sullivan recorded the year&#x27;s fastest 1500 m, a personal best, of 3:59.10, and only four days after that, she won the mile at the Bislett Games in Oslo, in a time of 4:17.25. This was the season&#x27;s best, and it moved O&#x27;Sullivan to fourth on the all-time world list. All four of these times were also new Irish records, and after this two-week period of record-breaking, O&#x27;Sullivan became a clear favourite to win any event she chose to compete in at the European Athletics Championships in Helsinki in August. At Helsinki, O&#x27;Sullivan elected to only contest the 3000 m, with her main opposition expected to come from Yvonne Murray. In the final, on 10 August, Murray set the pace with O&#x27;Sullivan on her shoulder. With 200 m to go, O&#x27;Sullivan surged past Murray to win easily in 8:31.84. O&#x27;Sullivan followed this with a win over 5000 m in the Grand Prix final in Paris on 3 September. She finished the Grand Prix season in 3rd place in the Women&#x27;s Overall standings. At the end of a long season, on 9 September, the tired O&#x27;Sullivan finished only fifth in the 1500 m at the World Cup in London.

=== 1995 ===

O&#x27;Sullivan continued to dominate international distance running in 1995. As she had done in 1994, O&#x27;Sullivan set the fastest time of the year in four events, the 1500 m, 1 mile, 2000 m and 3000 m, and the second fastest time in the 5000 m. O&#x27;Sullivan was the winner of 11 of the 12 races in which she competed over 1500 m or 1 mile in 1995. These victories included the only sub-4-minute 1500 m time recorded during the year, a new Irish record of 3:58.85 set at the Herculis meet in Monaco on 25 July. In the 3000 m, O&#x27;Sullivan was clearly in a class above her rivals, winning all five of her races, and producing four of the six fastest times, including the year&#x27;s fastest time of 8:27.57 at the Weltklasse meet in Zürich on 16 August. Her other 3000 m victories included the Bislett Games in Oslo on 21 July, and the Grand Prix final in Monaco on 9 September. O&#x27;Sullivan was left with the dilemma leading up to the World Championships at Gothenburg, of whether to compete in the 1500 m or the 5000 m. She had been unbeaten at 5000 m before Gothenburg, although the fastest time of the year, a new world record, had been set by Portugal&#x27;s Fernanda Ribeiro. In the end, O&#x27;Sullivan chose the 5000 m, and, after easily winning her heat on 10 August, she kicked clear of Ribeiro in the final two days later, to win the world title in 14:46.47. Three weeks later, on 1 September, at the ISTAF meeting in Berlin, O&#x27;Sullivan again battled over 5000 m with the new world record holder Ribeiro, and again O&#x27;Sullivan was victorious, winning in a time of 14:41.40, a new Irish record, and the third fastest 5000 m of all time. For the fourth year in a row, she won the Grand Prix Final, this time over 3000 m.

== 1996–1997==

Although she was not as dominant as she had been in 1994 and 1995, Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan continued to be a major force in 1996 at the distances between 1500 m and 5000 m. Her best event in 1996 was the 3000 m, where she was unbeaten for the third successive year, winning all five of her races. O&#x27;Sullivan produced the early season leading time of 8:42.40 in Eugene on 26 May, and then at Nice, on 10 July, she recorded the year&#x27;s fastest time of 8:35.42. In the 1500 m, only two women broke 4 minutes during the year, one of whom was O&#x27;Sullivan, who clocked her best time of 3:59.91 when winning at the Bislett Games in Oslo on 5 July. In terms of preparation for the Olympic Games held later that year in Atlanta, O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s best event appeared to be the 5000  m, the distance at which she was the reigning world champion. On 5 June, at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, O&#x27;Sullivan won in 14:54.75. A month later, on 12 July, at the Securicor Games in London, she beat a strong field to win in 14:48.36. The program at the Olympic Games in Atlanta was sufficiently scheduled to allow O&#x27;Sullivan to contest both the 5000 m and 1500 m events. Her early season form and world title the previous year had made her one of the favourites for the 5000 m; however, news of double-world record holder Wang Junxia competing made many observers revise their opinion. In the heats everything seemed on track when she easily won her heat in 15:15.80. However, in the final on 28 July, she was badly affected by a stomach upset, and after starting well gradually faded away and failed to finish. The race was won by 3000 and 10,000 m world record holder Wang Junxia of China. Her disappointment continued in the 1500 m, where, still weakened, she came second last in her heat and failed to qualify for the semi-finals.

O&#x27;Sullivan competed in her first indoor competition for five years at the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics in Paris in March 1997. Prior to that meeting, O&#x27;Sullivan had travelled to Australia to get some early season competition in the Australian domestic outdoor season. O&#x27;Sullivan recorded her best result in Canberra, on 11 January, where she won a 5000 m race in 15:10.98. She had entered both the 1500 m and 3000 m at the World Indoors, but eventually, she chose to only contest the 3000 m event. In the final, on 8 March, O&#x27;Sullivan hit the lead in the last lap, but she was overtaken by Romanian Gabriela Szabo who went on to narrowly defeat O&#x27;Sullivan in 8:45.75 compared to the Irishwoman&#x27;s second-place time of 8:46.19. At the World Cross Country Championships, she finished 9th but helped Ireland win the bronze medal in the Team Event. O&#x27;Sullivan had an indifferent outdoor season in 1997, and her best time of 8:53.53 over 3000 m, which she achieved in Paris on 25 June, was 7 seconds slower than the time she had set indoors in March. Similarly, her best performance at 5000 m for the year remained the time she had set in Australia in January. At the World Championships held in Athens, O&#x27;Sullivan produced her best 1500 m time of the year of 4:05.31 when she finished fourth in her semi-final on 3 August. In the final, held two days later, O&#x27;Sullivan was never a serious threat, and she finished 8th in 4:07.81. O&#x27;Sullivan had even greater disappointment in the 5000 m where she was the defending world champion, finishing only 7th in her heat and failing to qualify for the final.

== 1998–1999 ==

O&#x27;Sullivan made an impressive comeback in 1998. At the World Cross-Country Championships at Marrakech in March, she entered both the short course (4 km) and long course (8 km) events. On successive days, O&#x27;Sullivan won both events, and her 4 km time of 12:20 was 14 seconds ahead of her nearest rival. O&#x27;Sullivan continued this form into the track season, where her performances in the 1500 m, 3000 m and 5000 m were close to those she had produced at her peak in 1994 and 1995.

At the European Athletics Championships in Budapest, the 1500 m and 5000 m finals, events at which O&#x27;Sullivan usually doubled at major championships, were scheduled to be run on the same day, thus denying her the opportunity of competing in both events. Undeterred, O&#x27;Sullivan entered the 5000 m and 10,000 m, having never run the latter event before on the track. In the 10,000 m final, on 19 August, she shadowed the leaders, and then produced an astonishing 28.1 second final 200 metres to win the gold medal in 31:29.33 in her debut at the distance. Four days later, in the more familiar territory of the 5000 m, the pace was set by Romanian Gabriela Szabo, but again, O&#x27;Sullivan produced an explosive finishing sprint to defeat Szabo in 15:06.50. At the World Cup held the following month in Johannesburg, O&#x27;Sullivan won her second major international 5000 m competition of the year, again sprinting clear of the opposition following a very slow pace. She concluded her year by winning the BUPA Great North Run.

O&#x27;Sullivan took a break from competition for most of 1999, during which time she gave birth to her daughter, Ciara, on 10 July 1999. O&#x27;Sullivan returned to training 10 days after her daughter&#x27;s birth, and on 10 October, finished a half marathon in 70:05.

On 17 October, O&#x27;Sullivan won the Bupa Loughrea Run 99, in Loughrea, Co Galway with a world record 5 mi finishing time of 24:27.

==2000–2002==

With the prospect of competing at her third Olympic Games in September 2000 in Sydney, O&#x27;Sullivan competed in the Australian domestic outdoor season during the European winter, recording a fastest time over 5000 m of 15:10.24 at Sydney on 13 February 2000. Back in Europe, she won the Dublin Women&#x27;s Mini Marathon in June, before producing a number of quality performances on the track in her preparation for the Olympics. The Weltklasse meet in Zürich on 11 August produced the finest 3000 m race of the year, with the first six placings registering the six fastest times of 2000. O&#x27;Sullivan finished a close second in this race to Romanian Gabriela Szabo in a time of 8:27.58. At Sydney, on 22 September, O&#x27;Sullivan won her 5000 m heat with a season&#x27;s best of 15:07.91. In the final three days later, after an enthralling sprint finish, O&#x27;Sullivan won the silver medal behind Szabo in a National Record 14:41.02. She became only the second Irish woman to win an Olympic Medal, after Michelle Smith and the first Irish Track and Field Olympic Medalist since John Treacy took silver in Los Angeles in 1984. In the 10,000 m final, held on 30 September, O&#x27;Sullivan set another personal best and national record when finishing sixth in 30:53.37 performance. Shortly after the Olympics, she won the Grand Prix Final 3000 m. Following the Olympics, O&#x27;Sullivan made her marathon debut, winning the Dublin marathon in a time of 2:35:42 on 30 October.

In March 2001, O&#x27;Sullivan decided to compete in the World Indoor Championships. She finished 7th in the 3000 m and 9th in the 1500 m. After this she took a break from athletics to give birth to her second daughter, Sophie.

O&#x27;Sullivan returned in March 2002 for the World Cross Country Championships, being held in Dublin. She finished a respectable 7th in the Short Race, and led Ireland to Team Bronze. At the European Championships in Munich later that year, O&#x27;Sullivan attempted a defence of the two European golds she had won in 1998. In the 10,000 m she won silver in a national record of 30:47.59. O&#x27;Sullivan admitted she had been outclassed in the race by Paula Radcliffe, saying that only world record holder Wang Junxia could have beaten the British girl on the night. A few days later, O&#x27;Sullivan added a second silver in the 5000 m as she was beaten into second place by Marta Dominguez of Spain in a time of 15:14.85. Shortly afterwards she set a season&#x27;s best for the 3000 m in Zürich as she finished third in a time of 8:33.62. A week later, she ran her fastest 5000 m time since her Olympic silver in London in a time of 14:46.97, as she finished third. She ended an excellent season by winning her second BUPA Great North Run title in a national record time of 67:19.

== 2003–2009 ==

After an impressive 2002 season, O&#x27;Sullivan had a disappointing 2003. She started well with a win at the newly inaugurated Great Ireland Run, but she struggled during the summer Grand Prix races. However, she appeared to be finding her form at the right time when she ran a season&#x27;s best in the 3000 m in Zürich in a time of 8:37.55 on 15 August. At the World Championships in Paris later that month she was considered a possible medalist. She qualified very comfortably from her heat. However, in the final, she finished last of the 15 starters. In December she finished an impressive fourth at the European Cross-Country Championships and led Ireland to silver in the team event.

2004 was to be an even more disappointing season for O&#x27;Sullivan. She struggled to find her best form throughout the year. At the Olympic Games in Athens, she qualified for the final of the 5000 m. However, in the final, O&#x27;Sullivan, who was suffering from an illness, finished last of the 14 finishers, well over a lap behind the winner Meseret Defar. She was given a hero&#x27;s reception by the crowd as she completed her last lap. It was one of the more poignant moments of the 2004 Games. In November, O&#x27;Sullivan finished an impressive 4th in the World Half-Marathon Championship in Delhi.

In April 2005, O&#x27;Sullivan ran the London Marathon for the first time and finished 8th in a personal best time of 2:29:01. In June she won Dublin&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Mini Marathon for the second time. However, an injury kept her out of the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki.

In January 2006, O&#x27;Sullivan applied for dual citizenship, which would allow her to compete for both Ireland and Australia. This request was granted and she intended to represent Australia at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, but to represent Ireland in all other competitions. She was chosen for the Australian Commonwealth Games team for the 5000 m. However, she wasn&#x27;t able to compete due to a hamstring injury.

On 14 February 2007, O&#x27;Sullivan said she planned to retire after the Great Ireland Run on 15 April, having said the previous year that she planned to run competitively until the 2012 Olympics in London. She later confirmed that she would retire at the end of the 2007 season.

In March 2008, O&#x27;Sullivan was appointed team manager of the Australian team for the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 2009, she ran the Cork City Marathon,

==2010–present==

In 2012, O&#x27;Sullivan carried the Olympic flame when it arrived in Dublin on 6 June. She carried the flame onto St Stephen&#x27;s Green and lit an Olympic cauldron. O&#x27;Sullivan was made &quot;chef de mission&quot; for Team Ireland at the 2012 Olympic Games.

O&#x27;Sullivan completed the 2013 Ealing Half Marathon in 1:27:28.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio South Wales (formerly Swansea Sound) is an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Bauer Radio as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. The station broadcasts to Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and South Carmarthenshire from studios in the Llansamlet area of Swansea on DAB.

Up until 2022, the station broadcast on 1170 kHz across its broadcast area.

As of March 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 136,000, according to RAJAR.

== History ==

===Launch===
Swansea Sound began broadcasting at 6am, on Monday 30 September 1974. The first voice heard on air was its managing director, Charles Braham:

&quot;Bore da. Good Morning. As managing director I am very proud to say for the very first time that this is Swansea Sound bringing independent radio to Wales, to entertain, to inform and above all give yourselves a real involvement in community matters...&quot;

Chris Harper presented the station&#x27;s first breakfast show, opening with MFSB&#x27;s &quot;Love Is The Message&quot;. At its launch, it was the first and only commercial radio station in Wales and the seventh in the United Kingdom. It was also the first independent radio station to broadcast a bilingual service in the English and Welsh languages.

Originally, the station broadcast on 257 metres (1170 kHz) AM and 95.1 FM before moving its FM frequency to 96.4 in the early 1980s.

====Frequency split, launch of The Wave (1995)====
Until the early 1990s, FM adoption in the UK was relatively low, so it was common practice among stations to simulcast their programming on both AM and FM frequencies. Starting in the late 1980s, the UK government and the IBA required that ILR and BBC stations cease simulcasting and provide separate services on their AM and FM frequencies.

In September 1995, Swansea Sound&#x27;s FM frequency became a CHR (contemporary hit radio) station called &quot;96.4 Sound Wave&quot; (later &quot;96.4 The Wave&quot;, now &quot;Hits Radio South Wales&quot;), while &quot;Swansea Sound&quot; continued to broadcast its full service format on 1170 AM.

====Sale to UTV Media (2006)====
In 2006, UTV Media purchased the Wireless Group, owners of radio stations across the UK including Swansea Sound. It gave the station a new jingle package, logo and slogans, as well as a significant expansion to local programming.

In late 2016, UTV&#x27;s television assets were sold to ITV plc. The radio division of the company was later sold to News UK, and renamed back to its original name, the Wireless Group.

At News UK, its sister stations included TalkSport and the relaunched Virgin Radio UK.

===Station sale; rebrand as Greatest Hits Radio (2020)===

On 8 February 2019, Swansea Sound was sold alongside The Wave and the Wireless Group&#x27;s network of local radio stations to Bauer Radio. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

Under the terms of the deal, both Swansea Sound and The Wave, along with over 40 stations brought by Bauer in a “hold separate” ownership until early 2020.

On 27 May 2020, Bauer announced that Swansea Sound would rebrand and join the Greatest Hits Radio network from 1 September 2020.

Most of the station&#x27;s local output - including Breakfast, daytime and Welsh language shows - was retained due to conditions placed on the station&#x27;s AM broadcast licence by OFCOM.

As of April 2021, Greatest Hits Radio broadcasts 15 hours of local programming each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and six hours on Sundays, alongside hourly local news bulletins and peak-time traffic updates.

In July 2022, Greatest Hits Radio ended broadcasting on its medium-wave transmitter (1170 kHz) in South West Wales, after nearly 48 years on air. The closedown also removed the OFCOM requirement for the station to broadcast separate programming.

=== Local programming cuts ===
On 12 January 2023, it was announced that, in April 2023, Greatest Hits Radio would replace its local daytime programming - including breakfast, morning and afternoon shows - with networked programmes.

Bauer management told the industry news website, RadioToday, that the separate content for South Wales was &quot;no longer viable going forwards&quot;, although the station would retain its late-night Welsh-language programme, airing from Sunday to Thursday nights. The station is also expected to retain opt-outs for local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. A small number of contracts for freelance presenters were reported as &quot;up for review&quot;. As of September 2022, RAJAR reported the station had a reach of 14,000 weekly listeners. 

On 2 April 2023, the station broadcast its final English-language local programme. It was hosted by long-serving presenter Steve Dewitt from the Gowerton studios.

<text>Albert Heim (12 April 184931 August 1937) was a Swiss geologist, noted for his three-volume &quot;Geologie der Schweiz&quot;.

Born in Zürich, he was educated at Zürich and Berlin universities. Very early in life he became interested in the physical features of the Alps, and at the age of sixteen he made a model of the Tödi group. This came to the notice of Arnold Escher von der Linth, to whom Heim was indebted for much encouragement and geological instruction in the field.

In 1873 he became professor of geology in the polytechnic school at Zürich, and in 1875 professor of geology in the university. In the same year he married Marie Heim-Vögtlin, Switzerland&#x27;s first woman physician. In 1882 he was appointed director of the Geological Survey of Switzerland, and in 1884 the honorary degree of PhD was conferred upon him at the University of Berne.

He was especially distinguished for his researches on the structure of the Alps and for the light thereby thrown on the structure of mountain masses in general. He traced the plications from minor to major stages, and illustrated the remarkable foldings and overthrust faultings in numerous sections and with the aid of pictorial drawings. His initial misinterpretation of the Glarus Alps as resulting entirely from folding rather than from a major thrust fault, an error which he acknowledged in 1901, did not detract measurably from his considerable contributions.

His work, &quot;Mechanismus der Gebirgsbildung&quot; (1878), is now regarded as a classic, and it served to inspire Professor C Lapworth in his brilliant researches on the Scottish Highlands (see &quot;Geol. Mag.&quot; 1883). Heim also devoted considerable attention to the glacial phenomena of the Alpine regions. The Wollaston medal was awarded to him in 1904 by the Geological Society of London, and in 1905 he was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

A constant kinetic friction coefficient controlling the movement of pyroclastic flows and avalanches was named Heim coefficient after Albert Heim. The ridge Dorsum Heim on the Moon was also named after him.

In 1908, on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Swiss Kennel Club, two short-haired Bernese Mountain Dogs were shown by Franz Schertenlieb to Heim, an advocate of the Swiss mountain dogs. Heim recognized them as representatives of the old, vanishing, large mountain dog, whose ancestors had been widely spread across Europe, and bred as guard dogs, draft dogs, and droving-cattle dogs.

Heim was a Sennenhund expert, and started to encourage breeders to take an interest in them. These efforts resulted in the re-establishment of the breed. In 1909, the dogs were recognized as a separate breed by the Swiss Kennel Club and entered as &quot;Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund&quot; in Volume 12 of the Swiss stud book. The first breed club was formed in 1912 to promote the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. The Bernese Mountain Dog and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog are two of four distinctive farm-type dogs of Swiss origin that were saved from extinction and revitalized by Schertenlieb in the late 1800s.

<text>Signal 2 was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting from studios in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, to Staffordshire and Cheshire. The station was owned by Wireless Group and ran a &quot;gold format&quot; playlist. It was the sister station of Signal 1 and was based in the same studios.

In September 2020, Signal 2 was closed and replaced with a localised version of Greatest Hits Radio.

== History ==

The station began as Signal Radio which first broadcast at 6 a.m., 5 September 1983, with DJ John Evington selecting Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; as its first track. The station initially broadcast on 104.3 MHz and 1170 kHz (a wavelength of 257 metres, with the phrase &quot;2 5 7&quot; becoming a distinctive leitmotif), changing to 102.6 MHz soon after. The station&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Signal&quot; the name of the newspaper in Arnold Bennett&#x27;s local novels.

In the late 1980s the Independent Broadcasting Authority ordered stations to provide different services on their AM and FM outputs, and 1992 saw the launch of a &quot;Golden Breakfast Show&quot; on the 1170 AM frequency while for the rest of the day it would take the main Signal Radio service. On 18 January 1993 a full-time station, Signal Gold, was launched.

In February 2019, Signal 2 was sold to Bauer Radio.

==Technical==
The station&#x27;s 1170 AM transmitter was at Sideway, near to the A500 D Road, just south of the A50 junction. It transmitted 200 watts of power and could be heard throughout most of Staffordshire and Cheshire. This transmitter was closed in January 2023. 

Signal 2 was also broadcast on the local Stoke and Stafford DAB multiplex 12D, from transmitters at Alsagers Bank, Pye Green BT Tower, Sutton Common BT Tower and Tick Hill.

==Programming==
The majority of Signal 2&#x27;s programming was produced and presented from its Stoke-on-Trent studios. The nightly late show was simulcast with Wireless Group&#x27;s AM and FM stations while a syndicated show from Chris Country Radio aired on Sunday afternoons.

Signal 2 broadcast local news bulletins hourly from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. on weekends. Headlines were broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside thrice daily showbiz bulletins. The station also simulcast hourly Sky News Radio bulletins at all other times. Signal 2 also broadcast the bulk of Signal Radio&#x27;s sports coverage, including live commentary on Stoke City matches and a weekly magazine show, &quot;Jumpers for Goalposts&quot; on Friday evenings.

<doc id="938107" wikidata="Q7582174" url="?curid=938107" title="Squaw Island Light">
<text>Squaw Island Light is a privately owned lighthouse located on Ojibwa Island (formerly Squaw Island) in Lake Michigan, about six miles (10 km) north of Beaver Island. The island is part of St. James Township in Charlevoix County of the U.S. state of Michigan. There are of land on the island. Ojibwa Island and the lighthouse are privately owned and views of the lighthouse from the water are limited due to vegetation.

==History==

The U.S. Congress appropriated $25,000 to construct the light on March 3, 1891. Construction began the following spring. Work was completed on September 16, 1892. William H. Shields was appointed as the station&#x27;s head keeper, and entered the structure for the first time on the evening of October 10, 1892. The original dwelling, which was too small for both the head keeper, the assistant keeper and their families, was expanded in 1894.

Waters approaching the island become very shallow, less than six feet deep even though far out.

Construction of the Lansing Shoals Light Station offshore in 1928 made the Squaw Island light obsolete, and the station was abandoned. The lighthouse deteriorated over many years of neglect until Squaw Island passed into private ownership. Restoration of the station is being done by Bernie Hellstrom of Boyne City, Michigan. There is also a functioning unmanned light on another, much smaller Squaw Island in the St. Mary&#x27;s River.

<text>Krafft is a prominent lunar impact crater located near the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum. To the north is the lava-flooded walled plain Eddington. Almost due south is the crater Cardanus, and the two are connected by a 60-kilometer-long chain of craters known as the Catena Krafft.

Krafft has a sharp, circular rim with a rampart on the exterior, and no central peak. There are several associated craters near the southern rim that are notable for their size in relation to the dimensions of Krafft.

Krafft is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Krafft.

<doc id="938112" wikidata="Q337409" url="?curid=938112" title="Juris Podnieks">
<text>Juris Podnieks (December 5, 1950, Riga – June 23, 1992, Kuldīga District) was a Soviet/Latvian film director and producer.

== Early life and education ==
Podnieks was born in the family of an announcer and a dental technician. He started his career in film in 1967, becoming an assistant cameraman. He graduated from the Soviet VGIK film school in 1975 after which he started working at the Riga Film Studio. He became a director in 1979.

== Career ==

Podnieks&#x27; first film &quot;Cradle&quot; won an award at the Dok Leipzig festival. In 1981, his film &quot;The Brothers Kokari&quot; (, which followed Latvian composers-twins Imants and Gido Kokars) took the first prize at the Kiev Youth Festival. In the same year, his film &quot;Constellation of Riflemen&quot; () won honours in the 17th All State Festival in Leningrad and the Latvian Komsomol prize. This film gave Podnieks wide recognition within the Soviet Union.

Podnieks gained international recognition with his movie &quot;&#x27;Is It Easy to Be Young?&quot;. The film with dialogue in both Latvian and Russian was an exploration of Soviet youth, in which Podnieks talked to Latvian youngsters, many of which were seen as outliers and/or rebels at the time. The movie broke box-office records in the Soviet Union - something that rarely happened to documentaries.

As the Soviet Union collapsed, Podnieks cooperated with British television to give a first-hand insight on the events in the Soviet Union. Over three years, Podnieks filmed a five-part documentary titled &quot;Soviets&quot; or &quot;Hello, do you hear us?&quot; (title in the UK, &quot;Mēs?&quot; in Latvian). It showed civil unrest in Uzbekistan, survivors of the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, striking workers in Yaroslavl, environmental protests in Kirishi, former residents returning to Chernobyl etc. The first film in the series, &quot;Red Hot&quot;, was awarded the Prix Italia and the Peabody Award.

Later, Podnieks filmed movies that focused on the rise of national identity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. His &quot;Homeland&quot; (&quot;Krustceļš&quot;, 1992) was an account of folk festivals in these countries when national songs which had been banned by the Soviet regime for 50 years, were sung by massed choirs. While filming a follow-up in January 1991, Podnieks and his crew came under sniper fire during the attempted coup by Soviet forces in Riga. Podnieks was beaten up, his cameraman and long-time friend Andris Slapiņš was killed and Gvido Zvaigzne, another collaborator and friend of Podnieks, died of injuries. This was captured on video and shown as an addition to &quot;Homeland&quot; and later as an introduction for the revised version of this film.

Four of his films received the Lielais Kristaps prize as the best documentary of the year. 

Juris Podnieks drowned on 23 June 1992 (during Jāņi) while scuba-diving in Zvirgzdu Lake near Alsunga in Courland. Various conspiracy theories have been put forward ever since about the circumstances of his death.

== Legacy ==
In 2010, Podnieks was posthumously awarded the Latvian Order of Viesturs, 1st Class for his contribution to the restoration of the independence of Latvia. The award was given to his relatives in a ceremony by Latvian president Valdis Zatlers. He had also received the Soviet medal &quot;For Distinguished Labour&quot; and the USSR State Prize.

<text>Sunrise Radio is a 24-hour Asian commercial radio station, focusing on entertainment, music and news from the Indian subcontinent. It broadcasts to the Greater London area on 963/972 AM, nationally on DAB through the Sound Digital multiplex, and via the internet.

According to RAJAR, Sunrise Radio National and Sunrise Radio London broadcast to a combined weekly audience of 425,000 listeners as of December 2023.

==History==
Sunrise Radio started life as the pirate radio station &quot;Sina Radio&quot;, originally founded by Manjit Singh Gehdu and based in Southall, Middlesex from 1984 until 1988.

In 1989, owned by Avtar Lit, it was awarded a license and officially launched on 5 November 1989 becoming the first 24-hour radio station in the UK specifically for the Asian demographic. It initially broadcast to West London on 1413 AM. In 1994 it took over the BBC&#x27;s former 1458 kHz frequency which had been used for GLR.

In 1992, the station acquired Sunrise House in Southall which was officially opened on 21 January 1993 by Peter Baldwin Chief Executive of the Radio Authority. In 2016 Sunrise Radio Moved to new purpose built Studio and office in Hounslow, this is also the company&#x27;s Headquarters.

The station expanded by also broadcasting on satellite television, first on the Astra analogue satellite, and later on Sky Digital.

From 1991 through until August 2004, the Sunrise Radio satellite feed was the source of the live hourly IRN news bulletins for numerous UK commercial, community and hospital radio stations.

In July 2013, Lit was one of forty radio professionals honoured by the Radio Centre for their significant contribution to the growth and success of the industry.

On 13 January 2014, the station would go into administration. The station was bought by the mobile operator Lyca, and was able to retain its license, with a move to 963/972 AM. Tony Lit was appointed managing director, with Gurdev Jassi as chairman.

In November 2014, the Sunrise Radio Training Academy was launched - a free training scheme for those wanting to pursue a career in radio. The scheme allows those wishing to pursue a career in radio to train alongside professionals and learn every aspect of the business, from producing to presenting and radio journalism.

Sunrise Radio went Nationwide on DAB in early 2016.

On 5 November 2019 Sunrise Radio completed 30 years on air.

On 8 May 2023, Sunrise Radio launched Sunrise Smooth, a station playing easy listening Asian music. Sunrise Smooth was launched on DAB in London, but Sunrise Radio confirmed it had plans to launch the station on other DAB platforms in the UK.

==Events==
Sunrise Radio has organised and sponsored many events and melas, including a collaboration with the London Mayor&#x27;s office to put together the London Mela, launched in August 2003 in Gunnersbury Park, West London. The event attracted an audience of over 60,000.

In 2004 Sunrise Radio launched the Asian Lifestyle Show at London&#x27;s Olympia attracting over 40,000 people. The event was widely recognised as the largest celebration of Asian culture in Europe. The show was shortlisted for the &#x27;Best New Consumer Show 2004&#x27; by the Association of Event Organisers. The Asian Lifestyle Show 2004-2007 was consistently sold out.

Sunrise Radio has collaborated with University College London (UCL) and Imperial College to support their West End production, &quot;Rangeela&quot;.

<doc id="938121" wikidata="Q46124" url="?curid=938121" title="Sanatorium">
<text>A sanatorium (from Latin &quot;&quot; &#x27;to heal&#x27;), also sanitarium or sanitorium, is a historic name for a specialised hospital for the treatment of specific diseases, related ailments, and convalescence. 

Sanatoriums are often in a healthy climate, usually in the countryside. The idea of healing was an important reason for the historical wave of establishments of sanatoria, especially at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. One sought, for instance, the healing of consumptives especially tuberculosis (before the discovery of antibiotics) or alcoholism, but also of more obscure addictions and longings of hysteria, masturbation, fatigue and emotional exhaustion. Facility operators were often charitable associations, such as the Order of St. John and the newly founded social welfare insurance companies.

Sanatoriums should not be confused with the Russian sanatoriums from the time of the Soviet Union, which were a type of sanatorium resort residence for workers.

==History==
===Conception===
The first suggestion of sanatoria in the modern sense was likely made by George Bodington, who opened a sanatorium in Sutton Coldfield in 1836 and later published his essay &quot;On the Treatment and Cure of Pulmonary Consumption&quot; in 1840. His novel approach was dismissed as &quot;very crude ideas and unsupported assertions&quot; by reviewers in the &quot;Lancet&quot;, and his sanatorium was converted to an asylum soon after. The rationale for sanatoria in the pre-antibiotic era was that a regimen of rest and good nutrition offered the best chance that the patient&#x27;s immune system would &quot;wall off&quot; pockets of pulmonary TB infection. In 1863, Hermann Brehmer opened the &quot;Brehmersche Heilanstalt für Lungenkranke&quot; in Görbersdorf (Sokołowsko), Silesia (now Poland), for the treatment of tuberculosis. Patients were exposed to plentiful amounts of high altitude, fresh air, and good nutrition. Tuberculosis sanatoria became common throughout Europe from the late-19th century onward.

===Early establishments===
The Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium, established in Saranac Lake, New York, in 1885, was the first such establishment in North America. According to the Saskatchewan Lung Association, when the National Anti-Tuberculosis Association (Canada) was founded in 1904, its members, including renowned pioneer in the fight against tuberculosis R.G. Ferguson, believed that a distinction should be made between the health resorts with which people were familiar and the new tuberculosis treatment hospitals: &quot;So they decided to use a new word which instead of being derived from the Latin noun &quot;sanitas&quot;, meaning health, would emphasize the need for scientific healing or treatment. Accordingly, they took the Latin verb root &quot;sano&quot;, meaning to heal, and adopted the new word sanatorium.&quot;

Switzerland used to have many sanatoria, as health professionals believed that clean, cold mountain air was the best treatment for lung diseases. In Finland, a series of tuberculosis sanatoria were built throughout the country in isolated forest areas during the early 1900s. The most famous was the Paimio Sanatorium, completed in 1933 and designed by world-renowned architect Alvar Aalto. It had both sun-balconies and a rooftop terrace where the patients would lie all day either in beds or on specially designed chairs, the Paimio Chair. In Portugal, the Heliantia Sanatorium in Valadares was used for the treatment of bone tuberculosis between the 1930s and 1960s.

===In 20th-century United States===

In the early 20th century, tuberculosis sanatoria became common in the United States. The first of several in Asheville, North Carolina was established by Horatio Page Gatchell in 1871, before the cause of tuberculosis (then called &quot;phthisis&quot; or &quot;consumption&quot;) was even known. Fifty years earlier, J.F.E. Hardy had reportedly been cured in the &quot;healing climate&quot;. Medical experts reported that at above sea level, air pressure was equal to that in blood vessels, and activities, scenery, and lack of stress also helped. In the early 1900s, Arizona&#x27;s sunshine and dry desert air attracted many people (called &quot;lungers&quot;) who had tuberculosis, rheumatism, asthma, and numerous other diseases. Wealthier people chose to recuperate in exclusive TB resorts, while others used their savings to journey to Arizona and arrived penniless. TB camps in the desert were formed by pitching tents and building cabins. During the tuberculosis epidemic, cities in Arizona advertised the state as an ideal place for treating TB. Many sanatoria in Arizona were modeled after European away-from-city resorts of the time, boasting courtyards and individual rooms. Each sanatorium was equipped to take care of about 120 people.

The first sanatorium in the Pacific Northwest opened in Milwaukie Heights, Oregon, in 1905, followed closely by the first state-owned TB hospital in Salem, Oregon, in 1910. Oregon was the first state on the West Coast to enact legislation stating that the government was to supply proper housing for people with TB who could not receive adequate care at home. The West Coast became a popular spot for sanatoriums.

The greatest area for sanatoria was in Tucson with over twelve hotel-style facilities in the city. By 1920, Tucson had 7,000 people who had come for treatment of tuberculosis. So many people came to the West that not enough housing was available. In 1910, tent cities began to pop up in different areas; one was described as a place of squalor and shunned by most citizens. Many of the infected slept in the open desert. The area adjacent to what was then central Phoenix, called Sunnyslope, was home to another large TB encampment. The residents primarily lived in tents pitched along the hillsides of the mountains that rise to the north of the city. Several sanatoria also opened in southern California in the early 20th century due to the dry, warm climate.

The first tuberculosis sanatorium for Black Americans in the segregated South was the Piedmont Sanatorium in Burkeville, Virginia. Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a Louisville, Kentucky, tuberculosis sanatorium, was founded in 1911. It has become a mecca for curiosity seekers who believe it is haunted. Because of its dry climate, Colorado Springs was home to several sanatoria. A. G. Holley Hospital in Lantana, Florida, was the last remaining freestanding tuberculosis sanatorium in the United States until it closed on July 2, 2012.

In 1907, Stannington Sanatorium was opened in the northeast of England to treat tuberculosis in children. The sanatorium was opened using funds raised by a local charity, the Poor Children&#x27;s Holiday Association, now the region&#x27;s oldest children&#x27;s charity, Children North East. The largest U.S. tuberculosis sanatorium was located on the site of Chicago&#x27;s present-day North Park Village. Chicago&#x27;s Peterson Park fieldhouse housed the lab and morgue of Chicago&#x27;s Municipal Tuberculosis Sanatorium.

===Discovery of antibiotics and decline===
After 1943, when Albert Schatz, then a graduate student at Rutgers University, discovered streptomycin, an antibiotic and the first cure for tuberculosis, sanatoria began to close. As in the case of the Paimio Sanatorium, many were transformed into general hospitals. By the 1950s, tuberculosis was no longer a major public health threat in the developed world; it was controlled by antibiotics rather than extended rest. Most sanatoria had been demolished years before.

Some, however, have been adapted for new medical roles. The Tambaram Sanatorium in south India is now a hospital for AIDS patients. The state hospital in Sanatorium, Mississippi, is now a regional center for programs for treatment and occupational therapy associated with intellectual disability. In Japan in 2001, the Ministry of Welfare suggested changing the name of a leprosarium to a sanatorium.

=== Post-Soviet states ===

In the post-Soviet countries, sanatorium is generally used to refer to a combination resort/recreational facility and a medical facility to provide short-term complex rest and medical services. It is similar to a spa resort, but with medical services.

In countries of the former Warsaw Pact, sanatoria are hotels with health resort facilities and services such as massage, pools, saunas, aromatherapy, and oxygen therapy not covered by medical insurance; they are spa resorts catering to healthy people seeking a restful respite from their jobs. For example, Sanatorium Astória and others located in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, or the Geneva Sanatorium Hotel, Ukraine, serve this purpose. A doctor&#x27;s prescription is usually not required. However, a general practitioner is available for guests to have a medical check-up at the beginning and end of their stay.

Sanatoriums first began to achieve prominence in the Soviet Union in the early 1920s, with the introduction of the Labour Code of the Russian SFSR, which established basic recommendations and standards for Russian workers (distinct labour codes of the Union Republics would later be standardized in 1970). This Labour Code guaranteed at least two weeks of annual leave for all workers, recommending that it be spent at a sanatorium for health reasons. A medical professional would recommend a place and duration of stay, typically ranging from 24 days to 10 months, and the worker would file a form () for the recommended stay. The cost was partly or completely covered by unions or health insurance. 
By 1990, sanatoriums in the Soviet Union could hold up to 50,000 guests at once. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many sanatoriums fell into disrepair and some became refugee camps, but a number of sanatoriums across the former Union Republics are still in operation. Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan was known for such sanatoria, some of which have been refurbished.

==In culture==
Fictional stories that are set in sanatoriums often make use of the isolated locations of these health care facilities, high in a mountainous region. The emotions evoked by the sanatorium setting may be positive if the facility is beautiful and well-run, or dark and scary if the facilities are run-down or, in a horror story, abandoned. 

*&quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, the 1924 novel by German writer and social critic Thomas Mann, is set in a sanatorium.
*The Austrian-American Jewish poet and artist Samuel Greenberg wrote three poems about his experiences in sanatoria, including &quot;Wards Island Symphonique.&quot;
*The American heavy metal band Metallica has the song &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; on their 1986 &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; studio album, which had been in part inspired by &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.
*The mystery writer Mary Roberts Rinehart&#x27;s &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot; was set in a sanatorium.
*Major story elements of the 2015 drama horror video game &quot;Until Dawn&quot; are set in and around the fictional abandoned Blackwood Sanitorium.
*Provincial, the first solo album by Canadian musician John K. Samson features 2 songs referencing the Ninette Sanatorium, &quot;When I Write my Masters Thesis&quot; and &quot;Letter in Icelandic from the Ninette San&quot;.

<text>Thomas A. (Tim) Mutch (August 26, 1931 – October 6, 1980) was an American geologist and planetary scientist and mountain climber. He was a professor at Brown University beginning in 1960 and was on leave from Brown serving as Associate Administrator of Space Science at NASA at the time of his death in 1980. He disappeared during descent from Mount Nun in the Kashmir Himalayas.

==Biography==
Tim Mutch was an mountain climber and planetary scientist; he began mountain climbing in the 1950s in the Tetons and subsequently British Columbia where he made the first ascent of Mount Arjuna and in the Canadian Rockies where he made the first ascent of Eiffel Peak. In 1955 he went with Joseph Murphy to Pakistan where the two ascended Istor-o-nal (elevation 24,288 feet) in the Hindu Kush, believing that they were the first to summit this peak. In later years, as other climbers ascended Istor-o-nal it became unclear if the summit they reached had been the highest. 

While a professor at Brown University he published books regarding the geology of the Moon (&quot;Geology of the Moon: A Stratigraphic View&quot;, published 1973) and of Mars (&quot;The Geology of Mars&quot;, published 1977) and also taught courses on exploration, where he&#x27;d once led a group of Brown students in climbing the Himalayan peak Devistan, and geology. He was head of the Viking surface photography team on its mission to Mars in 1976. He is quoted as commenting on the first pictures: &quot;This is just an incredible scene. It truly is. Nothing before or after can compare. It is transparent, brilliant, boundless. An explorer would understand. We have stood on the surface of Mars.&quot;

At the time of his disappearance in 1980 he was on leave from Brown and serving as Associate Administrator of Space Science at NASA in Washington DC.

==Legacy==

A crater on Mars was named in his honor, and the &quot;Viking 1&quot; lander was formally renamed &quot;Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station&quot; on January 7, 1981, by then NASA Administrator, Robert A. Frosch; the engineering model currently displayed in the Smithsonian Institution has a small plaque beside it commemorating this, and a note that it will be left with the actual lander when circumstances permit. The Thomas &quot;Tim&quot; Mutch Memorial Fund was established in 1981 by his family and friends.

<doc id="938142" wikidata="Q646741" url="?curid=938142" title="Vueling">
<text>Vueling S.A. (, ) is a Spanish low-cost airline based at Viladecans in Greater Barcelona with operating bases at Barcelona–El Prat Airport (main); Paris-Orly Airport in Paris, France; Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport in Rome, Italy (secondary). It is the largest airline in Spain, measured by fleet size and number of destinations. As of 2021, Vueling serves 122 destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, and carried more than 34 million passengers in 2019. Since 2013, it has been an operating company of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus.

== History ==
===Early years===
Vueling was established on 10 February 2004 and commenced operations on 1 July 2004 with a flight between Barcelona and Ibiza. The initial fleet consisted of two Airbus A320 aircraft, based in Barcelona serving Brussels, Ibiza, Palma de Mallorca and Paris-CDG. The name Vueling was formed by combining the Spanish word &quot;vuelo&quot; (flight) with the English gerund suffix &quot;-ing&quot;.

Initially, major shareholders of Vueling were Apax Partners (40%), Inversiones Hemisferio (Grupo Planeta) (30%), Vueling&#x27;s management team (23%) and V.A. Investor (JetBlue Airways) (7%). During its nascent stages, the company&#x27;s general manager was Lázaro Ros, while Carlos Muñoz was CEO. In November 2007, Vueling appointed managing director of Spanair Lars Nygaard as CEO to replace Carlos Muñoz, who remained a member of the board of directors.

Madrid was added as the airline&#x27;s second base in 2005, followed by its first base outside Spain at Paris CDG in 2007. Seville followed in December 2009.

===Financial concerns and management re-shuffle===
In 2007, Apax Partners sold its then-21% stake in the carrier in June of that year, followed by two profit warnings issued in August and October. Two company directors and the chairman resigned shortly before the second profit warning, citing differences over commercial strategy. Shares in the company were also temporarily suspended. This led to Barbara Cassani, former Chief Executive of UK low-cost airline Go, joining Vueling as chairman of the board in September 2007. The airline then embarked on a restructuring exercise and posted its first profit in mid 2009.

===Vueling and Clickair merger===
In June 2008, Vueling and rival Spanish low-cost airline Clickair announced their intention to merge. The merger was designed to create a carrier better able to compete in the competitive Spanish airline market and mitigate high fuel costs with Iberia as the main industrial partner. While the new company would trade under the Vueling name, Clickair&#x27;s Alex Cruz was named as chief executive. The deal was subject to scrutiny and approval by European competition regulators, who were concerned that the merged airline would have a significant competitive advantage on around 19 routes. The regulators demanded the release of slots at Barcelona and other European airports as a condition of the merger. On 15 July 2009, the merger of Vueling and Clickair was completed. The new merged airline operates under the Vueling brand, with Clickair flights and aircraft re-branded under the Vueling name. It became the second largest Spanish carrier, flying 8.2 million passengers in 2009 to almost 50 destinations.

===Co-operation with MTV===

In 2009, Vueling for the second year running co-operated with MTV during the summer season. Two of Vueling&#x27;s A320 aircraft (EC-KDG and EC-KDH) were re-painted into MTV liveries with some MTV styling on-board too. The designs of both liveries were created by Custo Dalmau and both liveries were removed at the end of 2009. In the summer season of 2010, EC-KDG had again been re-painted into an MTV livery, and in 2011, it was re-painted into a livery based on the DJ and producer David Guetta; the livery has since been removed and co-operation with MTV has since ended.

===2010 onwards===
In November 2010, Vueling announced a new base at Toulouse Airport in France from April 2011, followed in December 2010 by the announcement of a new base in Amsterdam, also to open during April 2011. The Toulouse base opened on 23 April 2011, but has since closed.

In January 2011, further expansion was announced with Vueling adding a further nine aircraft to its fleet, including Airbus A319 aircraft. Six Airbus A320s were delivered between April and June 2011, whilst the remaining two A320s were delivered by the end of 2011.

On 21 March 2012, it was announced by CEO Alex Cruz that Rome would be added as a new base. The base launched on 25 March 2012 with one aircraft based there: the airline has since expanded at Rome with numerous new destinations. On 5 December 2012, Vueling announced the opening of a new base of operations in Florence: the carrier is to base one aircraft there and serve four new European destinations. Ten months later, on 25 October 2013, Vueling launched Florence-Catania, its first domestic route in Italy.

Since November 2013, the airline has continued to expand from its hub at Barcelona. On 6 November 2013, Vueling announced a new base with one aircraft in Brussels, with seven new destinations from May 2014, in addition to the four previous routes from Brussels. Also in November 2013, Vueling announced an expansion of its base at Rome-Fiumicino. From mid-2014, 8 aircraft would be based there, operating more than 30 routes. This expansion meant Rome-Fiumicino would become Vueling&#x27;s secondary hub, after Barcelona. In 2014, Vueling opened routes to Warsaw and Cracow in Poland, both of which were canceled in 2020.

During the first weekend of July 2016, Vueling had many delays and cancellations, which resulted in an investigation by the Spanish authorities. During the same month, Vueling cancelled all its flights to Sheremetyevo International Airport, Vilnius Airport and Rabat–Salé Airport. Clients were able to get a refund or fly to the nearest airport where Vueling flew. In October 2016, Vueling shut down their bases in Brussels, Catania and Palermo as part of restructuring measures.

In March 2017, Vueling canceled its route from Barcelona to Frankfurt Airport.

On 29 December 2017, it was announced that IAG would acquire Austrian airline Niki as a subsidiary for Vueling. However, Niki was later acquired by Niki Lauda, the owner of Laudamotion, with investment from Ryanair. A few months after losing the bid for Niki, IAG instead established Anisec Luftfahrt as a subsidiary of Vueling, operating as LEVEL, using four former Niki aircraft that had not been purchased by rival Lufthansa (and leased to Lauda).

In 2020, Vueling announced new routes linking Paris, France to Dubrovnik, Croatia and Seville, Spain to Marrakech, Morocco. Subsequently in December 2024, Vueling announced that the airline will launch flights between Florence and Brussels in April 2025 using their Airbus A319 aircraft.

==Corporate affairs==
===Business trends===
The key trends for Vueling are shown below (as at year ending 31 December):
===Takeover by IAG===

In November 2012, International Airlines Group, whose subsidiary Iberia held a 45.85% stake in Vueling, offered to buy the remaining 54.15% of the company with both Iberia and IAG owning both shares and not resulting in the company being wholly owned by IAG through 100% of shares. IAG, also the owner of British Airways, plans to use Vueling to help stem losses at Iberia. However, market trends (increased profits and improved figures from Vueling resulting in a higher share-price) had made IAG&#x27;s offer a significant undervaluation of the airline. Vueling had urged its shareholders to reject IAG&#x27;s offer and its shareholders had until the 8th of April 2013 to decide upon the recommendation.

On 27 March 2013, IAG improved its offer for Vueling, raising its offer per share from €7 to €9.25. Vueling shares quickly surged following the announcement, rising by 8.8% to €9.23 following a temporary suspension as BMAD waited on an official comment from Vueling regarding the updated offer. The acceptance period was also increased by 48 calendar days.

On 9 April 2013, the board of Vueling unanimously recommended shareholders accept an improved offer of €9.25 per share from IAG. IAG CEO Willie Walsh confirmed that the board had recommended the new offer; however, Walsh also stated that Vueling would not be merged with Iberia, saying, &quot;Vueling will operate as a stand-alone entity in the IAG group.&quot;

On 23 April 2013, IAG acquired control of Vueling, which saw the recently purchased 44.66% stake by IAG merged with Iberia&#x27;s existing 45.85% stake to form a 90.51% shareholding. Vueling remains a standalone company now within the IAG, and its management structure is unchanged; however, Vueling&#x27;s CEO reports directly to IAG CEO.

===Frequent flyer programme===
Vueling&#x27;s frequent flyer programme is Vueling Club, which allows members to earn and redeem Avios for award flights or fare discounts on Vueling and IAG airlines Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, and Level, and for award travel on Oneworld airline alliance partners. Vueling Club replaced Vueling&#x27;s original programme, Punto (Spanish for &quot;point&quot;), on 27 October 2017, after being announced prior in August 2017. Punto allowed account holders to earn and redeem points for Vueling flights.

<doc id="938143" wikidata="Q1338141" url="?curid=938143" title="Jesse Ramsden">
<text>Jesse Ramsden FRS FRSE (6 October 1735 – 5 November 1800) was a British mathematician, astronomical and scientific instrument maker. His reputation was built on the engraving and design of dividing engines which allowed high accuracy measurements of angles and lengths in instruments. He produced instruments for astronomy that were especially well known for maritime use where they were needed for the measurement of latitudes and for his surveying instruments which were widely used for cartography and land survey both across the British Empire and outside. An achromatic eyepiece that he invented for telescopes and microscopes continues to be known as the Ramsden eyepiece.

==Life==
Ramsden was born at Salterhebble, Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, England the son of Thomas Ramsden, an innkeeper and his wife Abigail née Flather.

Having attended the free school at Halifax from 1744 to 1747, he was sent at the age of twelve to his maternal uncle, Mr Craven, in the North Riding, and there studied mathematics under the Rev. Mr. Hall. After serving his apprenticeship as a cloth-worker in Halifax, he went to London where, in 1755, he became a clerk in a cloth warehouse. In 1758 he was apprenticed to a mathematical instrument maker and he proved so proficient that he was able to set up his own business only four years later. The quality and accuracy of his instruments established his reputation as the most able instrument maker in Europe for the next forty years until his death in 1800.

In 1765, Ramsden married Sarah Dollond, daughter of John Dollond, the famous maker of high quality lenses and optical instruments. Ramsden received a share in Dollond&#x27;s patent achromatic lens as dowry. Little is known of their life together but Sarah did not accompany him when he moved his workshop (and home). In 1773, Ramsden moved to 199 Piccadilly but Sarah and her son lived at Haymarket at a home belonging to her father&#x27;s family. At the time of her death on 29 August 1796 she lived at Hercules Buildings, off Westminster Road, Lambeth. She was buried at St Mary&#x27;s, Lambeth, on 1 September 1796. In his later years he lived above the workshop with a number of his apprentices. The Ramsdens had two sons and two daughters with only one, John, living past infancy. John later became a commander in the East India Company&#x27;s navy.

Ramsden&#x27;s dividing engine allowed instruments to be made smaller without loss of measurement accuracy. The rights for a portable sextant designed by Ramsden and used for maritime navigation were purchased by the Board of Longitude in 1777 for £300. An additional £315 was paid to allow for its construction details to be used by other craftsmen. He also received charges for servicing of the instruments.

Ramsden was of a genial disposition, but at the same time infuriated his clients with his tardiness in delivering their purchases, particularly of larger commissions. His three-year delay in providing William Roy with the theodolite for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) provoked a public row within the portals of the Royal Society and in its &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. Many delays could be attributed to Ramsden&#x27;s quest for perfection, as he continually refined his designs as the slightest shortcomings were revealed.

Ramsden was elected to the Royal Society in 1786 and to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in (probably) 1798.
The Copley Medal of the Royal Society was bestowed upon him in 1795 for his &#x27;various inventions and improvements in philosophical instruments.’

Ramsden&#x27;s health began to fail and he traveled to Brighton on the south coast to try to benefit from its better climate; he died there on 5 November 1800. He was buried at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly on 13 November. His instrument-making business in London was taken over by his foreman, Matthew Berge until his death in 1819. The estate passed on to his son. Many of Ramsden&#x27;s apprentices such as William Cary went on to establish their own instrument-making ventures. Others like Edward Troughton incorporated ideas from Ramsden into their own designs.

==Ramsden&#x27;s instruments==

===Dividing engines===
Ramsden created one of the first high-quality dividing engines. This led to his speciality in dividing circles, which began to supersede the quadrants in observatories towards the end of the 18th century. He published a &quot;Description of an Engine for dividing Mathematical Instruments&quot; in 1777.

===Other instruments===
He also built an early plate electrostatic generator in 1768.

===Surveying instruments===
In about 1785, Ramsden provided General William Roy a new large theodolite which was used for the measurement of the latitude and longitude separations of London (Greenwich) and Paris and later for the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain. This work provided the basis for the subsequent Ordnance Survey of the counties of Britain.

===Telescopes===
Ramsden is also responsible for the achromatic eyepiece named after him. In its simplest form it consists of two planoconvex lenses with the curved sides facing each other and separated by a gap of about 2/3 of their focal length. It had the additional advantage of allowing a greater distance (or eye relief) between the lens and the eye. It thus also allowed sunshades and prisms to be placed before it.

The exit pupil of an eyepiece was once called the &quot;Ramsden disc&quot; in his honour.

In 1791, he completed the Shuckburgh telescope, an equatorial mounted refracting telescope.

His most celebrated work was a 5-feet vertical circle, which was finished in 1789 and was used by Giuseppe Piazzi at the Palermo Astronomical Observatory in constructing his catalogue of stars and in the discovery of the dwarf planet Ceres on 1 January 1801.

===Micrometers===
He was the first to carry out in practice a method of reading off angles (first suggested in 1768 by the Duc de Chaulnes) by measuring the distance of the index from the nearest division line by means of a micrometer screw which moves one or two fine threads placed in the focus of a microscope.

==Honours==
Ramsden Rock in Antarctica is named after Jesse Ramsden.

<doc id="938146" wikidata="Q7417129" url="?curid=938146" title="Sandy Amorós">
<text>Edmundo &quot;Sandy&quot; Amorós Isasi (January 30, 1930 – June 27, 1992) was a Cuban professional baseball left fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers and Detroit Tigers. Amorós was born in Matanzas. He both batted and threw left-handed, and was listed as tall and . Dodgers scout Al Campanis signed him in 1951, struck by the his speed. Amorós also played for the New York Cubans of the Negro leagues in 1950.

==Career==
Amorós, nicknamed for his resemblance to boxing champ Sandy Saddler, had a brief but underrated Major League career. From 1954 to 1957, he was a valuable member of the lineup of the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was not understood at the time partly because Amorós was overshadowed by Dodgers&#x27; outfield stars like Duke Snider. But mostly he was underrated because the concept of On-Base Percentage (OBP) was not yet a part of player evaluations. Amorós&#x27;s batting averages were mediocre but, because he drew a large number of walks, his on-base percentages between 1954 and 1957 were .353, .347, .385 and .399.

The defining moment of Amorós&#x27; career with the Brooklyn Dodgers was one of the memorable events in World Series history. It was the sixth inning of the decisive Game 7 of the 1955 World Series. The Dodgers had never won a World Series and were now trying to hold a 2–0 lead against their perennial rivals, the New York Yankees. The left-handed Amorós came into the game that inning as a defensive replacement, as the right-handed throwing Jim Gilliam moved from left field to second base in place of Don Zimmer. The first two batters in the inning reached base and Yogi Berra came to the plate. Berra, notorious for swinging at pitches outside the strike zone, hit an opposite-field shot toward the left field corner that looked to be a sure double, as the Brooklyn outfield had just shifted to the right. Amorós seemingly came out of nowhere, extended his gloved right hand to catch the ball and immediately skidded to a halt to avoid crashing into the fence near Yankee Stadium&#x27;s 301 distance marker in the left field corner. He then threw to the relay man, shortstop Pee Wee Reese, who in turn threw to first baseman Gil Hodges, doubling Gil McDougald off first; Hank Bauer grounded out to end the inning.

==Life in Cuba and the United States==
Amorós&#x27; last season in the majors was 1960, after which he fell on hard times, largely because he came into conflict with Fidel Castro by refusing to take the manager&#x27;s job at Castro&#x27;s request for the Cuban National Team. He lost a $30,000 ranch he had owned for a number of years.

As author Roberto González Echevarría notes in his book &quot;The Pride of Havana&quot; (1999):

It was 1967 when Castro finally allowed Amorós to leave for the United States. After the Dodgers act of kindness of always looking out for those players considered part of the Dodger family, it became ironic Amorós would then move to Elton Avenue in the South Bronx, not too far from Yankee Stadium where he made that famous catch in the 1955 World Series. Later that year, his wife divorced him.

Sandy lost touch with everyone in the Cuban community, especially all those individuals he thought were his friends. As a result of moving to the South Bronx, Sandy was immediately embraced by the local Puerto Rican community. There he became active in supporting Herman Badillo a politician who had been a borough president, United States Representative, and candidate for Mayor of New York City. He was the first Puerto Rican to be elected to these posts and be a mayoral candidate in the continental United States. A few years later, Sandy wanted something else. So in 1977, he moved to Central Florida to live with his best friend, Victor Germain from Puerto Rico, who lived in the South Bronx and later moved to Tampa in search of a better quality of life for himself and his family.

Sandy lived comfortably in Clair-Mel City, a section of Tampa, with the Germain family for many years attending functions in his honor as the man who made it possible for Brooklyn to win its only World Series title.

After receiving an increase in his pension from Major League Baseball Sandy moved out on his own where he eventually developed an alcohol problem which later led to ill health (diabetes) and a life of poverty. He lost his best friend in 1986, then lost part of his left leg in 1987 to circulatory problems and gangrene where, at that time, old teammates and then the Baseball Assistance Team (BAT) gave him a helping hand.

Five years later, at the age of 62, Sandy died from pneumonia, in Miami, Florida.

<text>On the night of 24 August 2004, explosive devices were detonated on board two domestic passenger flights that had taken off from Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia, causing the destruction of both aircraft and the loss of all 90 people on board them.

Subsequent investigations concluded that two Chechen female suicide bombers were responsible for the bombings, which were also later claimed by the leader of the Chechen insurgency.

== Flights ==

===Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1303===
The first to crash was Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1303, a Tupolev Tu-134, registered RA-65080, which had been in service since 1977. The plane was flying from Moscow to Volgograd. It left Domodedovo International Airport at 22:30 on 24 August 2004. Communication with the plane was lost at 22:56 while it was flying over Tula Oblast, south of Moscow. The remains of the aircraft were found on the ground several hours later. Thirty-four passengers and 9 crew members were on board the plane. All of them died in the crash. 

The flight recorders were recovered from the crash site. The flight data recorder showed that the plane was cruising uneventfully at , before indicating some type of high energy event likely originating near the right hand side of the aircraft at seat row 19. Both recorders stopped recording within 2–3 seconds of this event. This was followed by the separation of the fuselage at that location an undetermined amount of time afterward.

===Siberia Airlines Flight 1047===
Just minutes after the first crash, Siberia Airlines Flight 1047, which had left Domodedovo International Airport at 21:35 on 24 August 2004, disappeared from the radar screens and crashed. The Tu-154 aircraft, registered RA-85556, which had been in service since 1982, was flying from Moscow to Sochi. According to an unnamed government source of the Russian news agency Interfax, the plane had broadcast a hijack warning while flying over Rostov Oblast at 22:59. However, it was later determined that this was the aircraft&#x27;s Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), and that the crew of Flight 1047 were not aware of any danger prior to the aircraft disappearing from radar. The plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after that and crashed. 38 passengers and 8 crew members were on board the plane, and there were no survivors after the crash. The debris of the aircraft was found on the morning of 25 August 2004, from the work settlement of Gluboky in Kamensky District of Rostov Oblast. 

The flight recorders were also recovered in this case; the flight data recorder along with wreckage analysis suggested an almost identical high-energy event to the one seen on Flight 1303 took place near the right hand side of the aircraft at seat row 25, while the aircraft was cruising at . The blast resulted in a rapid decompression of the cabin, damage to the elevator and rudder controls, a substantial loss of electrical power, and severe damage to the fuselage and tail components. The ELT was triggered half a second after the event, either by a crew member or automatically. The data recorder stopped working shortly after the explosion, but the cockpit voice recorder continued recording until impact with the ground, during which most of the crew discussions were about the loss of cabin pressure and electrical systems. The crew were caught completely off guard by the event, and there is no evidence that the crew was aware of the detonation of an explosive device on board.

== Responsibility ==
The two almost simultaneous crashes caused speculations about terrorism. President Vladimir Putin immediately ordered the Federal Security Service (FSB) to investigate the crashes. On 28 August 2004, the FSB had found traces of the explosive RDX in the remains of both planes. Itar-Tass news agency reported on 30 August 2004, &quot;without a shadow of a doubt, the FSB security service said that &#x27;both airplanes were blown up as a result of a terrorist attack&#x27;&quot;. A little known group called the Islambouli Brigades claimed responsibility; the truth of those claims remains uncertain. The Islambouli Brigades have also claimed that five of their members were on each plane; experts are skeptical about the possibility of (and the need for) so many terrorists on board.

The subsequent investigation found that the bombs were triggered by two female Chechen suicide bombers, Grozny residents Satsita Dzhebirkhanova (Siberia Airlines Flight 1047) and Amanta Nagayeva (Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1303). Nagayeva&#x27;s brother had disappeared three years earlier and the family believed he was abducted by Russian forces. Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev took responsibility for the bombings in an open letter published on the Chechen separatists&#x27; websites on 17 September 2004. He claimed that the aircraft bombings cost him US$4,000 in total. He has also denied the Islambouli Brigade&#x27;s claims.

The bombings followed the Moscow metro bombing which left 41 people dead in February 2004 and preceded other deadly attacks in Russia soon afterwards: on 31 August 2004 a bomb killed 10 at a Moscow subway station, and then the Beslan hostage crisis began on 1 September 2004 which would leave over 335 people dead, many of them children.

== Arrests and trials ==
On 24 August 2004, the bombers were stopped in the airport by police captain Mikhail Artamonov to be searched for weapons and for identification. They were accompanied by two male Chechens. The four of them arrived in Moscow on a flight from Makhachkala. According to the prosecution, Artamonov did not search them, and subsequently was charged with criminal negligence. On 30 June 2005, he was convicted of negligence and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. An appeal was made against the sentence, and the court subsequently reduced the term to six years.

According to investigators, ticket seller Armen Aratyunyan was bribed approximately €140 to sell tickets to the two women without obtaining their correct IDs. Aratyunyan also helped Dzhebirkhanova to bribe the ticket-checking clerk, Nikolai Korenkov, with €25 to get on board without the proper IDs. On 15 April 2005, Aratyunyan and Korenkov were convicted of giving and taking bribes. They were sentenced to 1.5 years in a settlement colony (settlement colony convicts have more rights and privileges than people in standard colonies).

Twenty-one relatives of the deceased passengers filed a civil suit against the security company responsible for checking the passengers, ZAO East-Line Aviation Security. They demanded 3,000,000 rubles (approximately €86,600 or US$115,000) in damages per victim. The trial in that case started in Volgograd on 22 February 2007. The security company claimed that it was not liable for damages, but the persons who organized the bombings were. The court handling the civil case sent a request to the prosecutor&#x27;s office to get an update on the criminal investigation. The investigation was suspended indefinitely on 26 September 2006. According to the investigator who was handling the case, the people helping the suicide bombers at the airport were killed in Chechnya, the people responsible for planning the bombings were not identified (Shamil Basayev, who claimed responsibility for organizing the bombings, was also killed), and consequently the investigation was suspended due to lack of suspects. That civil case was still in court . Other passengers&#x27; relatives also sued the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, S7 Airlines and two insurance companies, Ingosstrakh and OAO Afes for damages (none of the defendants acknowledge any liability). On 21 October 2007, the court in the latter case found S7 Airlines liable for damages and ruled they should pay the relative of the victim in question 250,000 rubles (approximately €7,000), which was about 10% of what the plaintiffs asked for. S7&#x27;s initial appeal was rejected by the court on 27 May 2008. A new S7 appeal was successful in April 2009 and the verdict was rejected. Relatives of the passenger appealed against the decision, but their appeal was dismissed in August 2009. They plan to appeal to a higher court.

<doc id="938150" wikidata="Q3184034" url="?curid=938150" title="Josef K (band)">
<text>Josef K were a Scottish post-punk band, active between 1979 and 1982, who released singles on the Postcard Records label. The band was named after the protagonist of Franz Kafka&#x27;s novel &quot;The Trial&quot;. Although they released just one album while together and achieved only moderate success, they have since proved influential on many bands that followed.

==History==
The band was formed in 1979 originally as TV Art by Paul Haig (vocals, guitar) and his childhood friend Ronnie Torrance (drums), later joined by Malcolm Ross (guitar, keyboards), with Gary McCormack added on bass guitar, who soon left (later joining The Exploited) with David Weddell replacing him. They disliked the name and were inspired to change it when they were asked at the last minute to open for Adam and the Ants at Clouds Ballroom on 20 July 1979 after the original opener dropped out.

After recording a ten-track demo, their first release was the &quot;Romance&quot;/&quot;Chance Meeting&quot; single on Orange Juice drummer Steven Daly&#x27;s Absolute label in December that year. They were then signed to Postcard Records, the label founded by Daly and Alan Horne, releasing a string of critically acclaimed singles in 1980 and 1981. The band recorded their debut album, &quot;Sorry for Laughing&quot;, in 1981 at Castle Sound Studios in Pencaitland, but it was shelved, with the band unhappy with the clean, polished production, Haig describing it as sounding &quot;flat and disinfected&quot;, with only a few copies being released. They returned to the studio in Belgium to record &quot;The Only Fun in Town&quot;, opting for a more &#x27;live&#x27; sound and recording the whole album in two days, Haig later expressing a measure of regret that &quot;we decided to make an almost unlistenable record with the vocals mixed down really low&quot;. It was their only album release while together, and while it placed well on the UK Independent Chart, it received a poor critical reception. Their earlier unreleased &quot;Sorry For Laughing&quot; album was eventually issued on a 1990 CD reissue of &quot;The Only Fun in Town&quot; and subsequently as its own vinyl LP in 2012 accompanied by a CD of TV Art&#x27;s early demos. 

The band played their last show on 23 August 1981 and split immediately after, Haig deciding to end the band as he felt they already had hit their peak. At the time Haig said, &quot;The band had been together too long, we&#x27;d achieved all we&#x27;d set out to do and everything was in a rut—there was not room for new ideas.&quot; Their last release was the 1982 single, &quot;The Farewell Single&quot;, through Les Disques du Crépuscule, which included the Peel session track, &quot;The Missionary&quot;. 

Torrance joined Boots for Dancing and later (with Weddell) formed The Happy Family with Nick Currie (aka Momus). Haig embarked on a long solo career, releasing a string of albums on his own Rhythm of Life label between 1984 and 2008, while Malcolm Ross joined Orange Juice and then played with Aztec Camera and Blancmange before embarking on a solo career. Ross and Weddell later reunited in Magic Clan.

==Musical style==
Musically, they resembled their label mates Orange Juice in fusing post-punk guitars with funk and disco rhythms. They were influenced by American bands such as Pere Ubu, Television, Talking Heads, and The Voidoids, and British bands such as Subway Sect. However, in terms of their lyrics and image Josef K were always far more downbeat and austere than Orange Juice, and were never to match Orange Juice&#x27;s commercial success. They were also described as sounding similar to Joy Division but &quot;less doomy&quot;. Haig was a fan of Joy Division and &quot;It&#x27;s Kinda Funny&quot; was inspired by the death of Ian Curtis. Haig&#x27;s lyrics were also inspired by the works of Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Hermann Hesse, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Knut Hamsun.

The band adopted what was described as an &quot;anti-rock stance&quot;, most members eschewing drink and (most) drugs, and the band never doing encores, engaging in stage banter, or signing autographs, all of which Ross considered &quot;patronizing&quot;.

==Influence==
Josef K would prove to be a major influence on several later 1980s bands, including The June Brides and The Wedding Present (who also never do encores). They also influenced later bands such as Franz Ferdinand, The Futureheads, and The Rapture, and they were described in 2006 as &quot;one of the most influential bands in Britain&quot;.

&quot;Sorry for Laughing&quot; was covered by German synth pop group Propaganda on their 1985 album &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; (and the remix album &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;), and again in 2004 by French New Wave/bossa nova band Nouvelle Vague.

In an interview with Nardwuar the Human Serviette, British musician King Krule stated that Josef K created, &quot;intelligent music and it&#x27;s coming from a pure place, I think. Any music like, which is real, should get a listen to.&quot;

Several notable labels have reissued Josef K albums and compilations, including Creation, Domino and LTM Recordings. In 2014 Les Disques du Crépuscule issued remastered vinyl and CD editions of &quot;The Only Fun in Town&quot;. The history of Josef K is covered in 2015 documentary film &quot;Big Gold Dream&quot;, with Malcolm Ross featuring prominently as an interviewee.

==Band members==
* Paul Haig – guitar, vocals, songwriting
* Malcolm Ross – guitar, violin
* David Weddell – bass
* Ronnie Torrance – drums

Original founding members included Neil Shah-Shah (guitar) and Matthew Cocks (bass), who left the band due to increasing press interest.
Gary McCormack briefly played bass before joining The Exploited.

All of their songs were written by either Paul Haig or Paul Haig/Malcolm Ross.

<text>Nikola Šarčević (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Шарчевић; born 9 July 1974, Örebro) is a Swedish musician of Serbian origin. He is the bassist, vocalist, and primary songwriter for the Swedish punk rock band Millencolin and also has a solo career with four studio albums. He also runs the Swedish brewery Duckpond Brewing.

==Biography==
His first band was Seigmenn. &quot;Lock-Sport-Krock&quot; was Šarčević&#x27;s first solo album. The title comes from the name of an imaginary football team that he and his brother pretended to play in when they were young. His solo work is mostly composed of folk rock and country music. On 20 April 2003, the band cancelled their US Tour after Nikola reported the disappearance of his brother, Miodrag Šarčević. Miodrag was found, deceased, four years later. It is believed a few Millencolin songs such as “Happiness For Dogs” and “Farewell My Hell” were written about him.

Nikola was listed as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Sexiest Vegetarians&quot; in 2008 and 2009, despite the fact that Nikola claims he is not a vegetarian. Šarčević&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Roll Roll and Flee&quot;, was released on 23 October 2006.

On 2 December 2009, Šarčević announced on his official Facebook page that he would release his third solo record &quot;Nikola &amp; Fattiglapparna&quot; in 2010. The 11-song album was his first release to be recorded entirely in Swedish. In 2010 it was released through his own label Stalemate Music.

He lives in Gothenburg with his wife Lisa, and three daughters.

<text>Thygeson&#x27;s superficial punctate keratopathy (TSPK) is a disease of the eyes. The causes of TSPK are not currently known, but details of the disease were first published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1950 by American ophthalmologist Phillips Thygeson (1903–2002), after whom it is named.

== Symptoms and signs==
A patient with TSPK may complain of blurred vision, dry eyes, a sensation of having a foreign body stuck in the eye, photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), burning sensations and watery eyes. On inspection with a slit lamp, tiny lumps can be found on the cornea of the eye. These lumps can be more easily seen after applying fluorescein or rose Bengal dye eye-drops. The lumps appear to be randomly positioned on the cornea and they may appear and disappear over a period of time (with or without treatment).

TSPK may affect one or both eyes. When both eyes are affected, the tiny lumps found on the cornea may differ in number between eyes. The severity of the symptoms often vary during the course of the disease. The disease may appear to go into remission, only to later reappear after months or years.

== Causes ==
The causes of TSPK are not yet well known.
==Diagnosis==
There are no proposed diagnostic criteria for TSPK, but its diagnostic features are &quot;(1) the presence of bilateral punctate epithelial keratitis; (2) a chronic course with exacerbations and remissions; (3) healing without scar formation; (4) no response to antibiotics; and (5) a striking symptomatic response to topical corticosteroids.&quot;

== Treatment ==
There are a number of different treatments to deal with TSPK. Symptoms may disappear if untreated, but treatment may decrease both the healing time and the chances of remission.
* Artificial tear eye-drops or ointments may be a suitable treatment for mild cases.
* Low-dosage steroidal eye-drops, such as prednisone, fluorometholone, loteprednol (Lotemax 0.5%) or rimexolone. Steroidal drops should be used with caution and the eye pressure should be regularly checked during treatment.
* Soft contact lenses.
* Ciclosporin is an experimental treatment for TSPK. It is usually used during transplants as it reduces the immune system response.
* Tacrolimus (Protopic 0.03% ointment) is also an experimental treatment.
* Laser eye treatment.
* Amniotic membrane (Case Study)
* PRK laser eye surgery has been suggested in a one-person case study as having cured this disease.

<doc id="938163" wikidata="Q5603006" url="?curid=938163" title="Green Party of Manitoba">
<text>The Green Party of Manitoba () (&#x27;GPM&#x27;) is a green provincial political party in Manitoba, Canada, founded on November 11, 1998. The party is legally autonomous from the Green Party of Canada, though for several years many of its members also belonged to the &quot;Green Party of Canada in Manitoba&quot;, a federal organization established in 1996 (the two organizations were separated in May 2005). The GPM has maintained a position as the fourth largest party in Manitoba since the 2003 election until the 2023 Manitoba general election, both in the number of votes received and candidates run. 

==History==

The GPM is not the first &quot;Green Party&quot; in Manitoba history. Former New Democrat Nick Ternette established a &quot;Green Party&quot; in Winnipeg in 1989, and fielded candidates under its banner in that year&#x27;s municipal elections. Ternette was from the left-wing of the NDP, and opposed the party&#x27;s centrist direction in the 1980s. His &quot;Green Party&quot; supported several progressive and environmental causes, and was further to the left than is the current GPM. None of its candidates were elected, and the party never ran candidates at the provincial level. Ternette is not affiliated with the GPM, although neither has he opposed it.

The current party was established by Winnipeg electoral reform activist Chris Billows in November 1998, with the assistance of the Green Party of Canada. Billows, Eymond Toupin, and future provincial leader Markus Buchart hosted the Green Party of Canada&#x27;s national convention in Winnipeg in August 1998.

==Policies==

The GPM&#x27;s policies are generally progressive. The party is primarily focused on environmental issues, and promotes the conservation of land and non-renewable natural resources. It has expressed concern about &quot;urban sprawl&quot; in Winnipeg&#x27;s suburbs, has called for reform in Manitoba&#x27;s commercial hog sector, and generally supports the rights of small farming interests over corporations.

The GPM also favours liberal positions on social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage, and promotes accessible public health care with emphasis on healthy lifestyles and illness prevention.

The party supports the extension of labour protection laws to farm-workers and a reduction of Manitoba&#x27;s standard work week from 40 to 32 hours. It has also endorsed full employment, and has criticized Gary Doer&#x27;s NDP government for not reversing welfare cutbacks enacted by the previous Tory government of Gary Filmon.

===2016 Platform===

The GPM released its 2016 election platform, entitled &quot;Building a Sustainable Manitoba&quot;, on April 5, 2016. The document included promises to introduce Guaranteed Annual Income to Manitoba, a $50/tonne carbon tax, fare-free transit, and oppose the Energy East pipeline, among other items.

==Elections==

The GPM ran six candidates in the provincial election of 1999, and scored its best result in the Winnipeg riding of Wolseley, where Phyllis Abbé, also a prominent former New Democrat, received 386 votes. Former party leader Markus Buchart ran against Premier Gary Filmon in the riding of Tuxedo, and received 126 votes. The party received 0.2% of all votes cast in the province.

The GPM ran fourteen candidates in the 2003 election. Buchart received 1193 votes (19.5%) in Wolseley, placing second against New Democrat Rob Altemeyer. The GPM as a whole received 4.08% of the vote in the ridings that it contested.

In the December 13, 2005, by-election held in the strongly conservative Fort Whyte constituency, GPM candidate Shelagh Pizey-Allen garnered 1.77% of the vote.

The GPM ran fifteen candidates in the 2007 election. The fifteen captured 1.33% of the vote, or 5.5% in the electoral divisions that were contested. The Green candidates received 12.32% in Wolseley placing second, 8.46% in Lord Roberts, 7.76% in St. Boniface, 6.38% in Fort Rouge, and third place in Minnedosa ahead of the Liberal Party of Manitoba.

In 2011, the GPM ran 32 candidates across the province and took 2.52% of the vote province-wide, or 10,886 votes, and won 4.56% of votes in ridings they contested. Party leader James Beddome placed second in the Wolseley constituency with 19.64% of the vote, while nine other candidates placed third in various ridings ahead of Liberal candidates.

In 2016, the party more than doubled its total votes from 2011, breaching the 5% total vote threshold for the first time in its history. Green candidates won an average of 9.14% of the vote in ridings they constested. In Wolseley, David Nickarz would take 35.94% of the vote and come within 500 votes of unseating longtime NDP MLA Rob Altemeyer. Beddome, still the party&#x27;s leader, would take 18.77% of the vote in Fort Garry-Riverview, an increase of 14 percentage points for the Greens over the previous election in that riding. The Greens also came in second in La Verendrye with Janine Gibson, Morden-Winkler with Mike Urichuk and Midland with Stacy O&#x27;Neill finishing ahead of NDP and Liberal candidates in ridings easily won by the Progressive Conservatives.

In 2019, still under Beddome&#x27;s leadership, the party ran candidates in over 40 ridings for the first time ever. Greens took over 6% of the total vote, an average of 8.25% in the ridings they contested. Despite this, no Green was elected and the party finished second in only three seats (Morden-Winkler with Mike Urchik, Wolseley with David Nickarz, and Turtle Mountain with David M. Neufeld), largely due to an improved performance by the New Democratic Party.

In 2022, Beddome announced he was stepping down as leader of the GPM. He was replaced by Janine Gibson in March 2023, ahead of that year&#x27;s provincial election. The Greens suffered a major setback, running only 13 candidates — the fewest since 1999, their first election — and receiving less than one percent of the total vote, and fewer raw votes than they did in 2003. The party did not finish ahead of third in any ridings, and finished third in just one riding where there were more than three candidates: Portage la Prairie, where Arishya Aggarwal finished 65 votes ahead of the last-place Liberal candidate.

==Leadership==

Leaders of the Green Party of Manitoba

*Markus Buchart, 1998–2005
*Daniel Drimes, 2005
*Holly Nelson, 2005–2006
*Andrew Basham, 2006–2008
*James Beddome, 2008–2013

Markus Buchart resigned as party leader in late February 2005.

The party&#x27;s second leader was Daniel Drimes. He served as leader from April 2 to 22, 2005.

The party&#x27;s first leadership contest under the rules of Elections Manitoba began on July 1, 2005, and a new leader was chosen on November 20, 2005. She was Holly Nelson, a retired electrical technologist and professional writer who owned a Winnipeg New Age book store, the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, during the 1990s.

In September 2006, a few weeks before the party&#x27;s leadership convention, she stepped down, having accepted an out-of-province job. On November 19, 2006, the party chose 23-year-old Andrew Basham as its new leader.

On November 15, 2008, James Beddome was elected leader, defeating incumbent leader Andrew Basham and contender Shane Nestruck. Beddome&#x27;s first term expired November 2010, and he was acclaimed a second term.

Alain Landry was appointed interim party leader for the Manitoba Greens in Nov, 2013 after the resignation of former leader James Beddome. James stepped down to focus on his new career as a lawyer after graduating from the faculty of law at the University of Manitoba in 2013.

Landry ran as a candidate in the 2007 and 2011 elections. In January 2014, he ran in the Morris by-election.

Former leader James Beddome sought to return to the leadership of the Greens and ran in the leadership race held in November 2014. He defeated past Green candidate Kate Storey in the contest with 21 votes to 9 for Storey.

In May 2022, Beddome announced that he would step down as leader of the Green Party of Manitoba. He was succeeded by Janine Gibson on March 26, 2023.

<text>UK Music is a British umbrella organisation which represents the collective interests of the production side of UK&#x27;s commercial music industry: artists, musicians, songwriters, composers, record labels, artist managers, music publishers, studio producers and music collecting societies.

==History==

Launched on 26 September 2008, Feargal Sharkey, former member of The Undertones, became chief executive officer (CEO) and Andy Heath, former chairman of British Music Rights, became chairman.

Sharkey left the organisation in November 2011, with Jo Dipple taking over as acting CEO. UK Music confirmed on 27 January 2012 the appointment of Dipple as the next CEO.

In January 2017, the organisation announced that Dipple would stand down as its CEO in June 2017. In April 2017, former Labour Party MP and Shadow Cabinet member Michael Dugher was announced as Dipple&#x27;s replacement. Dugher took over as CEO of UK Music in May 2017. 

In December 2019 Michael Dugher announced he would stepping down as CEO. Deputy CEO Tom Kiehl took over as acting CEO in February 2020. Former Labour Party Deputy Leader Tom Watson took over as chair, replacing Andy Heath, in April 2020.

Jamie Njoku-Goodwin took over as CEO of UK Music in October 2020. He left the organisation in August of 2023 to become Director of Strategy for PM Rishi Sunak, after gaining political prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic as a special adviser to Culture, and then Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Following nine months acting as Interim CEO, Tom Kiehl was formally appointed CEO in June 2024.

==Sound Rights==

In December 2008, UK Music launched Sound Rights, a free online resource for teachers and schools to support music study in schools. This was aimed at supporting the study of &quot;the role of music and musicians in society, the music industry and of artistic and intellectual property rights.&quot; In an interview with ISP Review in January 2009, UK Music Press Officer Adam Webb outlined the organisation&#x27;s plans for tackling the problems of illegal file sharing over the internet and building working relationships with Internet service providers.

<doc id="938165" wikidata="Q1336683" url="?curid=938165" title="Zhang Han (Qin dynasty)">
<text>Zhang Han (died June or July 205 BC) was a Chinese military general of the Qin dynasty. Between 209 and 208 BC, when uprisings against the Qin dynasty broke out, Zhang Han, along with Sima Xin and Dong Yi, led Qin forces into battle against the various rebel groups and defeated some of them. However, they lost to rebel forces led by Xiang Yu in 207 BC at the Battle of Julu and were forced to surrender. After the rebels overthrew the Qin dynasty in 206 BC, China was divided into the Eighteen Kingdoms and the three surrendered Qin generals were made kings – Zhang Han as the King of Yong, Sima Xin as the King of Sai, and Dong Yi as the King of Di. Their three kingdoms were collectively known as the Three Qins since they occupied the Guanzhong region, the heartland of the Qin state during the Warring States period. In 205 BC, Liu Bang, the King of Han, invaded Zhang Han&#x27;s kingdom and defeated Zhang Han in battle. Zhang Han committed suicide after his defeat.

==Life==
In 209 BC, the Dazexiang uprising broke out under the leadership of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang and sparked off a series of rebellions against the Qin dynasty throughout China. The rebel groups claimed to be restoring the former six states which were conquered between 230 and 221 BC by the Qin state, the precursor of the Qin dynasty. Zhou Wen (), one of Chen Sheng&#x27;s deputies, managed to lead a vanguard force that came close to Xianyang, the Qin capital, alarming the emperor Qin Er Shi, who called for a meeting with his subjects to discuss how to counter the rebels. Zhang Han, then holding the position of Minister Steward (), suggested to the emperor to grant amnesty to the convicts serving as labourers at the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, and recruit them to serve in the Qin army. The emperor approved Zhang Han&#x27;s proposal and appointed him as a general, putting him in charge of leading Qin forces to fight the rebels. Zhang Han defeated and drove back Zhou Wen, who committed suicide. The emperor then sent Sima Xin and Dong Yi to serve as Zhang Han&#x27;s deputies.

The Qin forces under Zhang Han continued to advance eastward and destroyed Chen Sheng&#x27;s rebel group. Zhang Han then led his troops to attack the Wei rebel group, defeating them along with their reinforcements from the Qi rebel group. After that, Zhang Han moved on to attack Tian Rong (), the leader of the Qi rebel group, prompting Tian Rong to seek help from Xiang Liang, the leader of the Chu rebel group. Zhang Han then engaged Xiang Liang at the Battle of Dingtao; Xiang Liang was defeated and killed in battle.

In 207 BC, when Zhang Han attacked and besieged the Zhao rebel group at Julu, the Zhao leader Zhao Xie () sought help from the Chu rebel group. King Huai II, the nominal leader of the Chu rebel group, sent Xiang Liang&#x27;s nephew, Xiang Yu, to assist their fellow rebels. Xiang Yu defeated Zhang Han at the Battle of Julu despite being heavily outnumbered. When Zhang Han sent Sima Xin to request reinforcements from Xianyang, the emperor refused to send aid after being deceived by Zhao Gao. Sima Xin escaped from Zhao Gao&#x27;s assassins on his return journey and reported to Zhang Han that the Qin government had fallen under Zhao Gao&#x27;s control. Zhang Han, along with his deputies and 200,000 troops, ultimately surrendered to Xiang Yu.

After the fall of the Qin dynasty in 206 BC, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Zhang Han and his two deputies were made the rulers of three of the Eighteen Kingdoms. The three kingdoms were known as the Three Qins because they occupied the lands of the former Qin state in the Guanzhong region. Later that year, the forces of Liu Bang, the King of Han, invaded Guanzhong and captured Zhang Han&#x27;s kingdom in a surprise attack. Zhang Han retreated to Feiqiu (; present-day Xingping, Shaanxi) and remained there. A year later, in June or July 205 BC, the Han army flooded Feiqiu and Zhang Han committed suicide after his defeat.

<doc id="938166" wikidata="Q5193892" url="?curid=938166" title="Cumberland Gap National Historical Park">
<text>The Cumberland Gap National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park located at the border between Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, centered on the Cumberland Gap, a natural break in the Appalachian Mountains.

The park lies in parts of Bell and Harlan counties in Kentucky, Claiborne County in Tennessee, and Lee County in Virginia. The park contains the Kentucky-Virginia-Tennessee tripoint, accessible via trail.

The town of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee, is located inside of the park&#x27;s territory.

The Cumberland Gap Visitor Center is located on U.S. Highway 25E just southeast of the city of Middlesboro, Kentucky, and just northwest of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel and the town of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee. The visitor center features a museum with interactive exhibits about the Gap&#x27;s role as a transportation corridor, an auditorium that shows films about the area&#x27;s cultural and natural history, a book store and the Cumberland Crafts gift shop with crafts from Appalachia.

==Physical geography==
The park covers and is among the largest national parks in the eastern United States. As of 2010, of this was designated as Recommended Wilderness. Elevation varies from a low of to a high of .

The park runs along the Cumberland Mountains, stretching about with an average width of . The park straddles a tri-state area encompassing land from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. It includes the area of the Wilderness Road running through the passage across the Cumberland Plateau and through the Cumberland Gap, an important geological feature that facilitated travel for American settlers and Native Americans. It includes 24 known cave features ranging in size from around to more than in length.

There are a number of large cliff systems in the park, the most prominent of which is the cliffs of White Rocks, located in the eastern portion of the area. At the northeastern end, the park sits adjacent to the Sillalah Creek Wildlife Management Area and the Martin&#x27;s Fork Wildlife Management Area and State Natural Area.

The climate of the area is mild, with hot and humid summers and mild winters, and an average annual temperature of .

===Hydrology===
The park contains over of streams. With the exception of one, Little Yellow Creek, all of these originate from within the park, with those to the north of the main ridge flowing into the Cumberland River, and those to the south flowing into the Powell River. Overall water quality in the park is good to fair, with some areas falling below recommended pH levels, likely due to natural causes, and others exceeding recommended levels of microorganisms, possibly due to contamination from campgrounds.

===Ecology===
The area of the park is 97% forested and contains 970 species of vascular plants, 90 of which are classified as sensitive or rare species. These include 108 non-native species of plants, and 31 considered to be highly aggressive invasive plants.

The park is home to at least 145 species of birds, and 40 species of mammals, including the near-threatened bat, &quot;Myotis sodalis&quot; (Indiana bat). The streams in the park house around 27 species of fish, including &quot;Chrosomus cumberlandensis&quot; (blackside dace), federally listed as an endangered species. Additionally, surveys have identified at least 36 species of reptiles and amphibians.

Ecosystems in the park are threatened by a number of insect infestations from non-native pest species, including &quot;Dendroctonus frontalis&quot; (southern pine beetle), and &quot;Adelges tsugae&quot; (hemlock woolly adelgid). The species &quot;Agrilus planipennis&quot; (emerald ash borer) and &quot;Lymantria dispar dispar&quot; (gypsy moth) also represent imminent threats from surrounding areas.

==History==
Business leaders from Middlesboro, Kentucky, meeting in Cincinnati for the Appalachian Logging Conference, proposed a Lincoln National Park, centered around Fern Lake as early as 1922. However, two bills introduced into the Kentucky State Legislature the following year by State Congressman John Robison both failed. Later attempts in 1929 sought to create memorials for Civil War battles fought in the area, and also failed. In 1938, the National Park Service agreed to support a park if the lands were donated to form one, and the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park Association was created, sparking more unsuccessful attempts in Kentucky, and then passage of a bill in Virginia in 1939 that paved the way for federal authorization.

The park was established on June 11, 1940, by Franklin Roosevelt in order to &quot;commemorate the story of the first doorway of the west&quot;. It was authorized by Congress to occupy an area not to exceed . The surrounding states purchased and deeded the land of the park to the federal government in 1955, and the official opening took place in 1959.

In 1992, the park purchased the area surrounding Gap Cave, which had previously been privately owned. By 1996, the park had undergone some $280 million in improvements, including construction of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel.

Toward the southern end of the park lies Fern Lake, created by an earthen dam in 1890, which provides water to the nearby town of Middlesboro, Kentucky. The area surrounding the lake was purchased by the park in four phases following the passage of the Fern Lake Conservation and Recreation Act, increasing the overall size of the park by 20%:
* Phases I and II, of land purchased in 2008 from Ataya Hardwoods by The Trust for Public Land and transferred to the park
* Phase III, of land purchased in 2009 from Molpus Woodlands Group
* Phase IV, of land purchased in 2009 from Molpus Woodlands Group

As of 2010 there were plans to acquire an additional of land surrounding the lake. As of 2018, the park had an estimated $15 million in deferred maintenance.

==Accommodations== 

The park includes a visitor center, renovated in 2004, which features a museum and auditorium, providing exhibits on the areas cultural and natural history, as well as book and gift shops.

Guided tours of the Hensley Settlement and Gap Cave are provided from the tourist center. Around from the center, along the Skyland Road, lies the Pinnacle Overlook, which, at an elevation of , overlooks the gap and the surrounding country.

There are of hiking trails, ranging from shorter routes such as the Sugar Run Trail, to the Ridge Trail, which spans the park and reaches an elevation of . The nearby Wilderness Road Campground includes 160 campsites. No hunting is permitted within the park.

Tri-State Peak is located in the park, and is accessible by trail. A marker designating the tripoint of the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, is located at the peak of the mountain.

===Tourism===
The park saw 737,547 visitors in 2017, according to statistics by the National Park Service. According to one federal study, in 2013 visitor spending amounted to $46 million in nearby communities, supporting 639 local jobs. Peak rates of visitation normally occur during the seasons of spring, summer and fall.

==Recognition==
In 2017, the park received the Keeper of the Light Award from the Southeast Region of the National Park Service, which recognizes excellence in education. In 2016, the United States Mint released a commemorative quarter as part of the America the Beautiful series honoring the park.

<text>Somalia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Since the civil war that broke out in the early 1990s, the Somali Olympic Committee has been supported by various factions centered on the capital of Mogadishu. 

Somalia&#x27;s two athletes were Fartun Abukar Omar, who finished last in her qualifying heat in the women&#x27;s 100 meter sprint, and Abdulla Mohamed Hussein who finished with the slowest time of all runners in the qualifying for the men&#x27;s 400 meters. Many Somali&#x27;s also followed the progress of American runner Abdihakem Abdirahman who was born in Somalia but left that country at age 13. He finished twelfth in the 10,000 metre race.

The Somali participation was also marked by controversy when the International Olympic Committee banned Farah W. Addo, the president of the Somali Olympic Committee from attending the Games. Addo had earlier been expelled from FIFA for embezzling millions of dollars meant to go the Somali soccer program. After complaints from FIFA, the IOC elected to ban Addo.

==Athletics==

Somali athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

;Men

<text>Medicinal or pharmaceutical chemistry is a scientific discipline at the intersection of chemistry and pharmacy involved with designing and developing pharmaceutical drugs. Medicinal chemistry involves the identification, synthesis and development of new chemical entities suitable for therapeutic use. It also includes the study of existing drugs, their biological properties, and their quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR).

Medicinal chemistry is a highly interdisciplinary science combining organic chemistry with biochemistry, computational chemistry, pharmacology, molecular biology, statistics, and physical chemistry.

Compounds used as medicines are most often organic compounds, which are often divided into the broad classes of small organic molecules (e.g., atorvastatin, fluticasone, clopidogrel) and &quot;biologics&quot; (infliximab, erythropoietin, insulin glargine), the latter of which are most often medicinal preparations of proteins (natural and recombinant antibodies, hormones etc.). Medicines can also be inorganic and organometallic compounds, commonly referred to as metallodrugs (e.g., platinum, lithium and gallium-based agents such as cisplatin, lithium carbonate and gallium nitrate, respectively). The discipline of Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry investigates the role of metals in medicine metallotherapeutics, which involves the study and treatment of diseases and health conditions associated with inorganic metals in biological systems. There are several metallotherapeutics approved for the treatment of cancer (e.g., contain Pt, Ru, Gd, Ti, Ge, V, and Ga), antimicrobials (e.g., Ag, Cu, and Ru), diabetes (e.g., V and Cr), broad-spectrum antibiotic (e.g., Bi), bipolar disorder (e.g., Li). Other areas of study include: metallomics, genomics, proteomics, diagnostic agents (e.g., MRI: Gd, Mn; X-ray: Ba, I) and radiopharmaceuticals (e.g., 99mTc for diagnostics, 186Re for therapeutics).

In particular, medicinal chemistry in its most common practice—focusing on small organic molecules—encompasses synthetic organic chemistry and aspects of natural products and computational chemistry in close combination with chemical biology, enzymology and structural biology, together aiming at the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents. Practically speaking, it involves chemical aspects of identification, and then systematic, thorough synthetic alteration of new chemical entities to make them suitable for therapeutic use. It includes synthetic and computational aspects of the study of existing drugs and agents in development in relation to their bioactivities (biological activities and properties), i.e., understanding their structure–activity relationships (SAR). Pharmaceutical chemistry is focused on quality aspects of medicines and aims to assure fitness for purpose of medicinal products.

At the biological interface, medicinal chemistry combines to form a set of highly interdisciplinary sciences, setting its organic, physical, and computational emphases alongside biological areas such as biochemistry, molecular biology, pharmacognosy and pharmacology, toxicology and veterinary and human medicine; these, with project management, statistics, and pharmaceutical business practices, systematically oversee altering identified chemical agents such that after pharmaceutical formulation, they are safe and efficacious, and therefore suitable for use in treatment of disease.

==In the path of drug discovery==

===Discovery===
Discovery is the identification of novel active chemical compounds, often called &quot;hits&quot;, which are typically found by assay of compounds for a desired biological activity. Initial hits can come from repurposing existing agents toward a new pathologic processes, and from observations of biologic effects of new or existing natural products from bacteria, fungi, plants, etc. In addition, hits also routinely originate from structural observations of small molecule &quot;fragments&quot; bound to therapeutic targets (enzymes, receptors, etc.), where the fragments serve as starting points to develop more chemically complex forms by synthesis. Finally, hits also regularly originate from &quot;en-masse&quot; testing of chemical compounds against biological targets using biochemical or chemoproteomics assays, where the compounds may be from novel synthetic chemical libraries known to have particular properties (kinase inhibitory activity, diversity or drug-likeness, etc.), or from historic chemical compound collections or libraries created through combinatorial chemistry. While a number of approaches toward the identification and development of hits exist, the most successful techniques are based on chemical and biological intuition developed in team environments through years of rigorous practice aimed solely at discovering new therapeutic agents.

===Hit to lead and lead optimization===

Further chemistry and analysis is necessary, first to identify the &quot;triage&quot; compounds that do not provide series displaying suitable SAR and chemical characteristics associated with long-term potential for development, then to improve the remaining hit series concerning the desired primary activity, as well as secondary activities and physiochemical properties such that the agent will be useful when administered in real patients. In this regard, chemical modifications can improve the recognition and binding geometries (pharmacophores) of the candidate compounds, and so their affinities for their targets, as well as improving the physicochemical properties of the molecule that underlie necessary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), and toxicologic profiles (stability toward metabolic degradation, lack of geno-, hepatic, and cardiac toxicities, etc.) such that the chemical compound or biologic is suitable for introduction into animal and human studies.

===Process chemistry and development===
The final synthetic chemistry stages involve the production of a lead compound in suitable quantity and quality to allow large scale animal testing, and then human clinical trials. This involves the optimization of the synthetic route for bulk industrial production, and discovery of the most suitable drug formulation. The former of these is still the bailiwick of medicinal chemistry, the latter brings in the specialization of formulation science (with its components of physical and polymer chemistry and materials science). The synthetic chemistry specialization in medicinal chemistry aimed at adaptation and optimization of the synthetic route for industrial scale syntheses of hundreds of kilograms or more is termed process synthesis, and involves thorough knowledge of acceptable synthetic practice in the context of large scale reactions (reaction thermodynamics, economics, safety, etc.). Critical at this stage is the transition to more stringent GMP requirements for material sourcing, handling, and chemistry.

===Synthetic analysis===
The synthetic methodology employed in medicinal chemistry is subject to constraints that do not apply to traditional organic synthesis. Owing to the prospect of scaling the preparation, safety is of paramount importance. The potential toxicity of reagents affects methodology.

===Structural analysis===
The structures of pharmaceuticals are assessed in many ways, in part as a means to predict efficacy, stability, and accessibility. Lipinski&#x27;s rule of five focus on the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, surface area, and lipophilicity. Other parameters by which medicinal chemists assess or classify their compounds are: synthetic complexity, chirality, flatness, and aromatic ring count.

Structural analysis of lead compounds is often performed through computational methods prior to actual synthesis of the ligand(s). This is done for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: time and financial considerations (expenditure, etc.). Once the ligand of interest has been synthesized in the laboratory, analysis is then performed by traditional methods (TLC, NMR, GC/MS, and others).

==Training==

Medicinal chemistry is by nature an interdisciplinary science, and practitioners have a strong background in organic chemistry, which must eventually be coupled with a broad understanding of biological concepts related to cellular drug targets. Scientists in medicinal chemistry work are principally industrial scientists (but see following), working as part of an interdisciplinary team that uses their chemistry abilities, especially, their synthetic abilities, to use chemical principles to design effective therapeutic agents. The length of training is intense, with practitioners often required to attain a 4-year bachelor&#x27;s degree followed by a 4–6 year Ph.D. in organic chemistry. Most training regimens also include a postdoctoral fellowship period of 2 or more years after receiving a Ph.D. in chemistry, making the total length of training range from 10 to 12 years of college education. However, employment opportunities at the Master&#x27;s level also exist in the pharmaceutical industry, and at that and the Ph.D. level there are further opportunities for employment in academia and government.

Graduate level programs in medicinal chemistry can be found in traditional medicinal chemistry or pharmaceutical sciences departments, both of which are traditionally associated with schools of pharmacy, and in some chemistry departments. However, the majority of working medicinal chemists have graduate degrees (MS, but especially Ph.D.) in organic chemistry, rather than medicinal chemistry, and the preponderance of positions are in research, where the net is necessarily cast widest, and most broad synthetic activity occurs.

In research of small molecule therapeutics, an emphasis on training that provides for breadth of synthetic experience and &quot;pace&quot; of bench operations is clearly present (e.g., for individuals with pure synthetic organic and natural products synthesis in Ph.D. and post-doctoral positions, ibid.). In the medicinal chemistry specialty areas associated with the design and synthesis of chemical libraries or the execution of process chemistry aimed at viable commercial syntheses (areas generally with fewer opportunities), training paths are often much more varied (e.g., including focused training in physical organic chemistry, library-related syntheses, etc.).

As such, most entry-level workers in medicinal chemistry, especially in the U.S., do not have formal training in medicinal chemistry but receive the necessary medicinal chemistry and pharmacologic background after employment—at entry into their work in a pharmaceutical company, where the company provides its particular understanding or model of &quot;medichem&quot; training through active involvement in practical synthesis on therapeutic projects. (The same is somewhat true of computational medicinal chemistry specialties, but not to the same degree as in synthetic areas.)

<text>The Peru national football team (), nicknamed La Bicolor, represents Peru in men&#x27;s international football. The national team has been organised, since 1927, by the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF). The FPF constitutes one of the ten members of FIFA&#x27;s South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). Peru has won the Copa América twice, and has qualified for the FIFA World Cup five times (last appearing in 2018); the team also participated in the 1936 Olympic football competition and has reached the semi-finals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The team plays most of its home matches at the Estadio Nacional in Lima, the country&#x27;s capital.

The team wears distinctive white shirts adorned with a diagonal red stripe, which combine Peru&#x27;s national colours. This basic design has been used continuously since 1936, and gives rise to the team&#x27;s common Spanish nickname, &quot;la Blanquirroja&quot; (&quot;the white-and-red&quot;). Peruvian football fans are known for their distinctive cheer &quot;¡Arriba Perú!&quot; (&quot;Onward Peru!&quot;) and large celebrations. Peru has a longstanding rivalry with Chile.

The Peru national team enjoyed its most successful periods thanks to footballing generations from the 1930s and the 1970s. The 1930s generation led Peru at the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and won the 1938 Bolivarian Games and the 1939 Copa América, with goalkeeper Juan Valdivieso and forwards Teodoro Fernández and Alejandro Villanueva playing important roles. The 1970s generation qualified Peru for three World Cups and won the Copa América in 1975; the team then notably included defender Héctor Chumpitaz and the forward partnership of Hugo Sotil and Teófilo Cubillas. Teodoro Fernández and Teófilo Cubillas are both often considered Peru&#x27;s greatest player in history.

The national team&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer is Paolo Guerrero, with 39 goals, and its two joint most-capped players are Roberto Palacios and Yoshimar Yotún, both with 128 appearances. Since February 2025, Peru is managed by the former goalkeeper Óscar Ibáñez.

== History ==
During the 19th century, British immigrants and Peruvians returning from England introduced football to Peru. In 1859, members of the British community in the country&#x27;s capital founded the Lima Cricket Club, Peru&#x27;s first organisation dedicated to the practice of cricket, rugby, and football. These new sports became popular among the local upper-class over the following decades, but early developments stopped due to the War of the Pacific that Peru fought against Chile from 1879 to 1883. After the war, Peru&#x27;s coastal society embraced football as a modern innovation. In Lima&#x27;s &quot;barrios&quot;, football became a popular daily activity, encouraged by bosses who wanted it to inspire solidarity and productivity among their workers. In the adjacent port of Callao and other commercial areas, British civilian workers and sailors played the sport among themselves and with locals. Sports rivalries between locals and foreigners arose in Callao, and between elites and workers in Lima—as foreigners departed, this became a rivalry between Callao and Lima. These factors, coupled with the sport&#x27;s rapid growth among the urban poor of Lima&#x27;s La Victoria district (where, in 1901, the Alianza Lima club formed), led to Peru developing the Andean region&#x27;s strongest footballing culture, and, according to historian Andreas Campomar, &quot;some of the most elegant and accomplished football on the continent&quot;.

The Peruvian Football League, founded in 1912, held annual competitions until it disbanded in 1921 amid disputes amongst its clubs. The Peruvian Football Federation (FPF), formed in 1922, reorganised the annual tournament in 1926. The FPF joined the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) in 1925 and, after restructuring its finances, formed the Peru national football team in 1927. The team debuted in the 1927 South American Championship, hosted by the FPF at Lima&#x27;s Estadio Nacional. Peru lost 0–4 against Uruguay in its first match, and won 3–2 over Bolivia in its second. Peru did not advance beyond the first stage of the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930.

The 1930s were the team&#x27;s first golden era, when they improved their game through play with more experienced teams. The &quot;Combinado del Pacífico&quot; (a squad composed of Chilean and Peruvian footballers) toured Europe from 1933 to 1934. Starting with Ciclista Lima in 1926, Peru&#x27;s football clubs toured Latin America with much success. During one of these tours—Alianza Lima&#x27;s undefeated journey through Chile in 1935—emerged the &quot;Rodillo Negro&quot; (&quot;Black Roller&quot;), a skillful group led by forwards Alejandro Villanueva, Teodoro Fernández and goalkeeper Juan Valdivieso. Sports historian Richard Witzig described these three as &quot;a soccer triumvirate unsurpassed in the world at that time&quot;, citing their combined innovation and effectiveness at both ends of the field. Peru and the &quot;Rodillo Negro&quot; impressed at the 1936 Summer Olympics, won the inaugural Bolivarian Games in 1938, and finished the decade as South American champions.

Historian David Goldblatt assessed the decline of its previous success: &quot;despite all the apparent preconditions for footballing growth and success, Peruvian football disappeared&quot;. He attributes this sudden decline to Peruvian authorities&#x27; repression of &quot;social, sporting and political organisations among the urban and rural poor&quot; during the 1940s and 1950s. Nevertheless, Peru performed creditably at the South American Championships, placing third in Brazil 1949 and Chile 1955, and missed qualification for the Sweden 1958 World Cup finals, over two legs to eventual champions Brazil.
Successes during the late 1960s, including qualification for the 1970 FIFA World Cup finals in Mexico, ushered in a second golden period for Peruvian football. The formidable forward partnership between Teófilo Cubillas and Hugo Sotil was a key factor in Peru&#x27;s triumphs during the 1970s. Peru reached the quarter-finals in 1970, losing to the tournament winners Brazil, and earned the first FIFA Fair Play Trophy; historian Richard Henshaw describes Peru as &quot;the surprise of the 1970 competition, showing flair and a high level of skill&quot;. Five years later, Peru became South American champions for the second time when it won the 1975 Copa América (the then-rechristened South American Championship) despite failing to qualify for West Germany 1974 a year earlier. The team next qualified for two consecutive World Cup finals, reaching the second round in Argentina 1978 and the first group stage in Spain 1982. Peru&#x27;s early elimination in 1982 marked the end of the side&#x27;s globally-admired &quot;flowing football&quot;. Peru, nonetheless, barely missed the Mexico 1986 World Cup finals after placing second in a qualification group to eventual champions Argentina. In their golden period from 1970 to 1982, Peru was among the best teams in the world.

By the late 1980s, renewed expectations for Peru were centred on a young generation of Alianza Lima players known colloquially as &quot;Los Potrillos&quot; (&quot;The Colts&quot;). Sociologists Aldo Panfichi and Victor Vich write that &quot;Los Potrillos&quot; &quot;became the hope of the entire country&quot;—fans expected them to qualify for the Italy 1990 World Cup finals. These hopes were dashed when the national team entered a hiatus after its manager and several of its players died in a plane crash carrying most of Alianza&#x27;s team and staff in 1987. Peru subsequently only came close to reaching the France 1998 World Cup finals, missing qualification on goal difference, but would go on to win the 1999 Kirin Cup tournament in Japan (sharing the title with Belgium) and reached the semi-finals at the 1997 Copa América and the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup (contested as an invitee).

Qualification for the FIFA World Cup finals continued being an elusive objective for Peru during the early 21st century. According to historian Charles F. Walker, player indiscipline problems marred Peru&#x27;s national team and football league. Troubles in the FPF, particularly with its then-president Manuel Burga, deepened the crisis in Peruvian football—FIFA temporarily suspended the country from international competition, in late 2008, because the Peruvian government investigated alleged corruption within the FPF. Burga&#x27;s twelve-year tenure as FPF president, deemed by journalists and the public as disastrous for the national team, despite a third place at the 2011 Copa América, ended in 2014. The FPF&#x27;s new leadership appointed Juan Carlos Oblitas as the federation&#x27;s new director and Ricardo Gareca as Peru&#x27;s manager in March 2015. Sports journalists credited Gareca with revitalizing Peru&#x27;s football prowess by improving the players&#x27; training and professional conduct. Under Gareca, Peru participated in the group stage of the Russia 2018 World Cup finals and finished runners-up at the 2019 Copa América. After Peru narrowly missed qualification for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, losing the inter-continental play-off against Australia, the FPF appointed former team captain Juan Reynoso as Peru&#x27;s new manager. Dissatisfied with results for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the FPF replaced Reynoso with Uruguayan Jorge Fossati in 2023.

== Kit ==
The Peru national football team plays in red and white, Peru&#x27;s national colours. Its first-choice kit has been, since 1936, white shorts, white socks, and white shirts with a distinctive red &quot;sash&quot; crossing their front diagonally from the proper left shoulder to the right hip and returning on the back from the right hip to the proper left shoulder. This basic scheme has been only slightly altered over the years.

Peru&#x27;s kit has won praise as one of world football&#x27;s most attractive designs. Christopher Turpin, the executive producer of NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; news show, lauded the 1970 iteration as &quot;the beautiful game&#x27;s most beautiful shirt&quot;, also describing it as &quot;retro even in 1970&quot;. Miles Kohrman, football reporter for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, commended Peru&#x27;s kit as &quot;one of soccer&#x27;s best-kept secrets&quot;. Rory Smith, Chief Soccer Correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, referred to Peru&#x27;s 2018 version of the jersey as &quot;a classic&quot; with a nostalgic, fan-pleasing &quot;blood-red sash&quot;. The version worn in 1978 came first in a 2010 ESPN list of the &quot;Best World Cup jerseys of all time&quot;, described therein as &quot;simple yet strikingly effective&quot;.

Peru&#x27;s first kit, made for the 1927 South American Championship, comprised a white-and-red striped shirt, white shorts and black socks. At the 1930 World Cup, Peru used an alternate design because Paraguay had already registered a similar kit with white-and-red striped shirts. The Peruvians instead wore white shirts with a red collar, white shorts and black socks. The team added a horizontal red stripe to the shirt for the 1935 South American Championship. The following year, at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the team adopted the iconic diagonal red sash design it has retained ever since. According to historian Jaime Pulgar-Vidal Otálora, the idea for the design came from school football matches in which coloured sashes worn over the shoulder would allow two teams wearing white shirts to play against each other.

Peru wears as its badge the emblem of the Peruvian Football Federation. The first badge, presented in 1927, had a heater shield design with the country&#x27;s name and the federation&#x27;s acronym (FPF). Eight different emblems followed, with the longest-lasting design being the modern French escutcheon form emblazoned in the team&#x27;s jersey from 1953 until 2014. This design had the Peruvian flag at its base, and either the country&#x27;s name or the federation&#x27;s acronym at its chief. Since 2014, the badge has a retro-inspired heater shield design, with the entire field comprised by Peru&#x27;s flag and the federation&#x27;s acronym, surrounded by a gold-colored frame.

Eight sportswear manufacturers have supplied Peru&#x27;s national team. The first, German company Adidas, supplied the team&#x27;s kit in 1978 and 1983–1985. The FPF has signed contracts with manufacturers from Brazil (Penalty, 1981–82), Switzerland (Power, 1989–1991), Italy (Diadora, 1991–1992), England (Umbro, 1996–1997, 2010–2018), Ecuador (Marathon Sports, 2018–2022), and another from Germany (Puma, 1987–1989). The team has also been supplied by three local firms: Calvo Sporwear (1986–1987), Polmer (1993–1995), and Walon Sport (1998–2010). Since January 2023, Adidas produces Peru&#x27;s kit.

== Stadium ==

The traditional home of Peruvian football is the country&#x27;s national stadium, the Estadio Nacional in Lima, which seats 50,000 spectators. The present ground is the Estadio Nacional&#x27;s third incarnation, renovated under the Alan García administration. Its official re-inauguration, 24 July 2011, marked 88 years to the day after the original ground opened on the same site in 1923.

To celebrate the centenary of Peru&#x27;s independence from Spain, Lima&#x27;s British community donated the original Estadio Nacional, a wooden structure with a capacity of 6,000. Construction began on 28 July 1921, overseen by President Augusto B. Leguía. The stadium&#x27;s re-inauguration on 27 October 1952, under the Manuel A. Odría administration, followed an onerous campaign for its renovation led by Miguel Dasso, president of the &quot;Sociedad de Beneficencia de Lima&quot;. The renovated stadium boasted a cement structure and larger spectator capacity of 53,000. Its last redevelopment, in 2011, included the construction of a plaque-covered exterior, an internal multicoloured illumination system, two giant LED screens, and 375 private suites.

A distinctive feature of the ground is the Miguel Dasso Tower on its north side, which contains luxury boxes (renovated in 2004). The Estadio Nacional currently has a natural bermudagrass pitch, reinstalled as part of redevelopments completed in 2011. Previously, the FPF had installed artificial turf in the stadium for the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship, making it the only national stadium in CONMEBOL with such a turf. Despite the synthetic ground&#x27;s rating of &quot;FIFA Star II&quot;, the highest certification granted to artificial pitches, players accused the turf of causing them injuries, such as burns and bruises.

Peru sometimes play home matches at other venues. Outside the desert-like coast region of Lima, the thin atmosphere at the high-altitude Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega in Cusco has been described as providing strategic advantages for Peru against certain visiting teams. Other common alternate venues for the national team include two other grounds in the Peruvian capital—Alianza&#x27;s Estadio Alejandro Villanueva and Universitario&#x27;s Estadio Monumental &quot;U&quot;.

The national team&#x27;s training grounds are located within the &quot;Villa Deportiva Nacional&quot; (VIDENA) sports complex in Lima&#x27;s San Luis district. Since 1981, the complex is managed by the Peruvian Institute of Sport (IPD). In 2017, following Peru&#x27;s qualification for the Russia 2018 World Cup finals, the Peruvian Football Federation announced the creation of a new complex, the Center of National Teams, in Lima&#x27;s Chaclacayo district. The new complex will contain six training grounds for both the male and the female squads, including the senior and the youth sides. In 2023, the FPF also announced its &quot;Plan Maestro&quot;, which incorporates modernized infrastructure in the VIDENA.

== Supporters ==

Football has been the most popular sport in Peru since the early 20th century, with Peru having one of the largest fanbases in the Americas and possibly the world. Originally largely exclusive to Lima&#x27;s Anglophile elite and expatriates, and secluded from the rest of the city, football became an integral part of wider popular culture during the 1900s and 1910s. Over the following decades, Augusto Leguía&#x27;s government institutionalised the sport into a national pastime by promoting and organising its development. Consequently, the national football team became an important element of Peru&#x27;s national identity. According to the historian Carlos Aguirre, nationalist fervor spiked during the qualification phase for the 1970 World Cup finals, because the revolutionary government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado tied the national team&#x27;s success with the alleged cultural, social, and psychological changes spurred by the country&#x27;s new political project.

Peruvian football fans are known for their distinctive cheer &quot;¡Arriba Perú!&quot; (&quot;Onward Peru!&quot;), unabating popular chant &quot;¡Vamos peruanos!&quot; (Let&#x27;s go Peruvians!), as well as for their use of traditional Peruvian &quot;música criolla&quot; to express support, both at national team games and at club matches. &quot;Música criolla&quot; attained national and international recognition with the advent of mass media during the 1930s, becoming a recognised symbol of Peru and its culture. The national team&#x27;s most popular anthems are &quot;Peru Campeón&quot;, a &quot;polca criolla&quot; (Peruvian polka) glorifying Peru&#x27;s qualification for the 1970 World Cup, and &quot;Contigo Perú&quot;, a &quot;vals criollo&quot; (Peruvian waltz) that newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot; calls &quot;the hymn of Peruvian national football teams&quot;. In 2018, a FIFA-sanctioned worldwide online poll honoured the &quot;fervent and dedicated group&quot; of Peruvian supporters at that year&#x27;s World Cup tournament with the FIFA Fan Award.

The Estadio Nacional disaster of 24 May 1964, involving Peruvian supporters, is cited as one of the worst tragedies in football history. During a qualifying match for the 1964 Olympics between Peru&#x27;s under-20 team and its counterpart from Argentina, the Uruguayan referee Angel Payos disallowed a would-be Peruvian equaliser, alleging rough play. Spectators threw missiles from the stands while two fans invaded the pitch and attacked the referee. Police threw tear gas into the crowd, causing a stampede; trying to escape, fans were crushed against the stadium&#x27;s locked gates. A total of 315 people died in the chaos, with more than 500 others injured.

== Rivalries ==

=== Chile ===

The Peru national football team maintains prominent rivalries with its counterparts from neighbouring Chile and Ecuador. The Peruvians have a favourable record against Ecuador and a negative record against Chile. Peru faced both rivals in the 1939 South American Championship in Lima, which also marked the first time that Peru faced Ecuador in an official tournament; Peru won both games. Peru also defeated its rivals during qualifying for the Argentina 1978 World Cup, directly eliminating both teams.

The Chile–Peru football rivalry is known in Spanish as the &quot;Clásico del Pacífico&quot; (&quot;Pacific Derby&quot;). CNN World Sport editor Greg Duke ranks it among the top ten football rivalries in the world. Peru first faced Chile in the 1935 South American Championship, defeating it 1–0. The football rivalry between Peru and Chile, partly a reflection of the geopolitical conflict between both neighboring states, is primarily a result of both football squads vying for recognition as the better team in South America&#x27;s Pacific coast—as their football confederation is historically dominated by countries in South America&#x27;s Atlantic coast. The two countries traditionally compete with each other over the rank of fourth-best national team in South America (after Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay). They also both claim to have invented the bicycle kick; Peruvians call it the &quot;chalaca&quot;, while it is the &quot;chilena&quot; in Chile.

=== Ecuador ===
The rivalry between the Ecuador and Peru football teams is rooted in the historical border conflict between the two nations dating back to the 19th century. In 1995, after the brief Cenepa War, CONMEBOL contemplated altering that year&#x27;s Copa América group stage to prevent a match between the two sides, but ultimately did not. According to cultural historian Michael Handelsman, Ecuadorian fans consider losses to Colombia or Peru &quot;an excuse to lament Ecuador&#x27;s inability to establish itself as an international soccer power&quot;. Handelsman adds that &quot;[t]he rivalries are intense, and the games always carry an element of national pride and honor&quot;.

==Results and fixtures==

The following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.

== Managers ==
A total of 44 managers have led the Peru national football team since 1927 (including multiple spells separately); of these, 36 have been from Peru and 24 have been from abroad. Sports analysts and historians generally consider Peru&#x27;s most successful managers to have been the Englishman Jack Greenwell and the Peruvian Marcos Calderón. The former managed Peru to triumph in the 1938 Bolivarian Games and the 1939 South American Championship, and the latter led Peru to victory in the 1975 Copa América tournament and coached it at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Three other managers have led Peru to tournament victories—Juan Carlos Oblitas, Freddy Ternero, and Sergio Markarián each oversaw Peru&#x27;s victory in the Kirin Cup in Japan, in 1999, 2005 and 2011, respectively.

Soon after forming Peru&#x27;s national football team, the FPF invited Uruguayan coaches Pedro Olivieri and Julio Borelli to manage the squad. Olivieri received the FPF&#x27;s first appointment, for the 1927 South American Championship, due to his prior experience managing Uruguay. Borelli became the national team&#x27;s second manager, for the 1929 South American Championship, after some years of refereeing football matches in Peru. The Spaniard Francisco Bru, Peru&#x27;s third manager and first World Cup coach at the inaugural tournament in 1930, previously had been Spain&#x27;s first manager. The FPF next appointed the national team&#x27;s first Peruvian coach, Telmo Carbajo, for the 1935 South American Championship. Coach Ricardo Gareca was credited well, bringing Peru to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, finished second in the 2019 and placed third in 2015 and fourth in 2021 Copa Américas, along with almost bringing Peru to their sixth World Cup in 2022 but was removed in 2022. The team&#x27;s manager since February 2025 is Óscar Ibáñez who took the role as caretaker.

Managers that brought outstanding changes to the Peru national team&#x27;s style of play include the Hungarian György Orth and the Brazilians Didi and Tim. Orth coached Peru from 1957 to 1959; sports historian Andreas Campomar cites Peru&#x27;s &quot;4–1 thrashing of England in Lima&quot; as evidence of Orth&#x27;s positive influence over the national team&#x27;s offensive game. Víctor Benítez, Peru&#x27;s defensive midfielder under Orth, attributes the Hungarian with maximizing the team&#x27;s potential by accurately placing each player in their optimal positions. Didi coached Peru from 1968 to 1970 and managed it at the 1970 FIFA World Cup; Campomar attributes Didi&#x27;s tactics as the reason for Peru&#x27;s development of a &quot;free-flowing football&quot; style. &quot;Placar&quot;, a Brazilian sports journal, attributed Tim, who managed Peru at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, with making Peru &quot;a team that plays beautiful, combining efficiency with that swagger that people thought only existed in Brazil&quot;.

=== Notable ===

A report published by CONMEBOL in 2008 described Peru as traditionally exhibiting an &quot;elegant, technical and fine football style&quot;, and praised it as &quot;one of the most loyal exponents of South American football talent&quot;. In 2017, Argentine manager Ricardo Gareca described Peruvian footballers as &quot;technically sound, [physically] strong and adaptable&quot;, adding that their adaptability resulted from Peru&#x27;s diverse geography.

Peruvian players noted in the CONMEBOL report as &quot;true artists of the ball&quot; include forwards Teófilo Cubillas, Pedro Pablo León and Hugo Sotil, defender Héctor Chumpitaz and midfielders Roberto Challe, César Cueto, José del Solar, and Roberto Palacios. Cubillas, an attacking midfielder and forward popularly known as &quot;El Nene&quot; (&quot;The Kid&quot;), is widely regarded as Peru&#x27;s greatest ever player. Chumpitaz is often cited as the team&#x27;s best defender; Witzig lists him among his &quot;Best Players of the Modern Era&quot;, and praises him as &quot;a strong reader of the game with excellent ball skills and distribution, [who] marshalled a capable defence to support Peru&#x27;s attack&quot;. &quot;El Gráfico&quot;, an Argentine sports journal, described Cueto, Cubillas, and José Velásquez as, collectively, &quot;the best [midfield] in the world&quot; in 1978.

Before Cubillas&#x27; appearance, Teodoro &quot;Lolo&quot; Fernández, a forward nicknamed &quot;El Cañonero&quot; (&quot;The Cannoneer&quot;), held the status of Peru&#x27;s greatest player—due to his powerful shots, marksmanship, and club loyalty to Universitario. Fernández participated as a key member of the &quot;Rodillo Negro&quot; team of the 1930s, along with Alejandro Villanueva and Juan Valdivieso. Fernández scored most of the team&#x27;s goals; his partner in attack, the gifted playmaker Villanueva, awed audiences with his acrobatic skills. Goalkeeper Valdivieso had a reputation as a penalty stopper with exceptional athleticism.

In 1972, teams representing Europe and South America played a commemorative match in Basel, Switzerland, for the benefit of homeless children. Cubillas, Chumpitaz, Sotil, and Julio Baylón played in the South American team, which won the game 2–0; Cubillas scored the first goal. The teams held another match the following year, at Barcelona&#x27;s Camp Nou, with the declared intent of fighting global poverty. Cubillas, Chumpitaz, and Sotil again participated, with Chumpitaz named South America&#x27;s captain. Each of the Peruvians scored in a 4–4 draw, which South America won 7–6 on penalties.

== Team records ==
The Peru national football team has played 645 matches since 1927, including friendlies. The largest margin of victory achieved by a Peru side was a 9–1 win against Ecuador on 11 August 1938, at the Bolivarian Games in Colombia. The team&#x27;s record defeat was a 7–0 loss to Brazil at the 1997 Copa América in Bolivia.

=== Most appearances ===

The two Peruvian players with the most international caps are Roberto Palacios, and Yoshimar Yotún who both made 128 appearances for the side from 1992 to 2007 and 2011 to present. The player with the third-most caps is Paolo Guerrero and Luis Advíncula both with 124. The Peruvian goalkeeper with the most appearances is Pedro Gallese with 114.

The team&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer is Paolo Guerrero, with 39 goals in 124 appearances. He is followed by Jefferson Farfán, with 27 goals in 102 appearances, and Teófilo Cubillas, who scored 26 goals in 81 appearances. Of the top ten scorers for Peru, Teodoro Fernández, with 24 goals in 32 games, holds the best goal-per-appearance ratio (0.75 goals/match). Claudio Pizarro scored Peru&#x27;s fastest ever goal, coming less than a minute into a match against Mexico on 20 August 2003.

Peru&#x27;s current captain is forward Paolo Guerrero. Midfielder Leopoldo Basurto was the team&#x27;s first captain. Defender Héctor Chumpitaz held the Peruvian team&#x27;s leadership position for the longest time, between 1965 and 1981. Forward Claudio Pizarro had the second-longest tenure as captain, from 2003 to 2016. In 2022, streaming service Netflix launched &quot;Contigo capitán&quot;, a series about Paolo Guerrero&#x27;s doping ban that almost impeded his participation in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Other notable captains include Rubén Díaz (1981–1985), Julio César Uribe (1987–1989), Juan Reynoso (1993–1999), and Nolberto Solano (2000–2003).

== Competitive record ==
=== FIFA World Cup ===

Peru has taken part in the World Cup finals five times. The Peruvian team competed at the first World Cup in 1930 by invitation, and has entered each tournament at the qualifying stage since 1958, qualifying for the finals four times: in 1970, 1978, 1982 and 2018. Its all-time record in World Cup qualifying matches, as of 2017, stands at 43 wins, 37 draws and 69 losses. In the finals, the team has won five matches, drawn three and lost ten, with 21 goals in favour and 33 against. Peru won the inaugural FIFA Fair Play Trophy, awarded at the 1970 World Cup, having been the only team not to receive any yellow or red cards during the competition. Peru has the peculiar distinction of always facing the tournament&#x27;s eventual winners during the finals phase.

Luis de Souza Ferreira scored Peru&#x27;s first World Cup goal on 14 July 1930, in a match against Romania. José Velásquez scored Peru&#x27;s fastest World Cup finals goal—that is, that scored soonest after kick-off—two minutes into the match against Iran on 11 June 1978. Jefferson Farfán is Peru&#x27;s top scorer and fifth-overall top scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualification, with 16 goals. Teófilo Cubillas is the team&#x27;s top scorer in the World Cup finals, with 10 goals in 13 games. During the 1930 competition, a Peruvian became the first player sent off in a World Cup—his identity is disputed between sources as either defender Plácido Galindo or midfielder Mario de las Casas. Peru&#x27;s Ramón Quiroga holds the unusual record of being the only goalkeeper to commit a foul in the opponent&#x27;s side of the pitch in a match at the World Cup finals.
=== Copa América ===

Peru&#x27;s national team has taken part in 34 editions of the Copa América since 1927, and has won the competition twice (in 1939 and 1975). The country has hosted the tournament six times (in 1927, 1935, 1939, 1953, 1957 and 2004). Peru&#x27;s overall record in the competition is 58 victories, 40 draws, and 66 losses. Peru won the Fair Play award in the 2015 edition.

Demetrio Neyra scored Peru&#x27;s first goal in the competition on 13 November 1927, in a match against Bolivia. Christian Cueva scored Peru&#x27;s fastest Copa América goal, two minutes into the match against Brazil on 14 June 2015. Four tournaments have featured a Peruvian top scorer: Teodoro Fernández in 1939, and Paolo Guerrero in 2011, 2015, and 2019. Fernández, the Copa América&#x27;s third-overall scorer, was named best player of the 1939 tournament; Teófilo Cubillas, voted the best player in the 1975 competition, is the only other Peruvian to win this award.

Peru earned its first continental title in 1939, when it won the South American Championship with successive victories over Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. This marked the first time that the competition had been won by a team other than Uruguay, Brazil, or Argentina. Peru became South American champions for the second time in 1975, when it won that year&#x27;s Copa América, the first to feature all ten CONMEBOL members. Peru came top of their group in the first round, eliminating Chile and Bolivia, and in the semi-finals drew with Brazil over two legs, winning 3–1 in Brazil but losing 2–0 at home. Peru was declared the winner by drawing of lots. In the two-legged final between Colombia and Peru, both teams won their respective home games (1–0 in Bogota and 2–0 in Lima), forcing a play-off in Caracas that Peru won 1–0.
=== CONCACAF Gold Cup ===
Peru competed in the CONCACAF Gold Cup&#x27;s fifth edition in 2000. Peru participated, along with Colombia and South Korea, as that year&#x27;s invitees. The Peruvian team&#x27;s overall record in the tournament is 1 victory, 1 draw, and 2 losses.

Ysrael Zúñiga scored Peru&#x27;s first goal in the competition on 14 February 2000, in a match against Haiti. Roberto Palacios, the team&#x27;s top scorer with two goals in four matches, received a spot in that year&#x27;s &quot;team of the tournament&quot;, comprising the competition&#x27;s eleven best players.

Peru progressed past the North American tournament&#x27;s first stage, despite not winning any of its matches, as the second-best ranked team in Group B behind the United States. Peru next defeated Honduras 5–3 in a heated quarter-finals match that ended a minute early due to a pitch invasion by irate Honduran fans. Colombia defeated Peru 2–1 in the semi-finals, in a match that included an own goal from Peru&#x27;s Marcial Salazar.

=== Olympic Games ===
Peru&#x27;s senior side has competed in the Olympic football tournament once, at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. The multiracial 1936 team has been described by historian David Goldblatt as &quot;the jewel of the country&#x27;s first Olympic delegation&quot;. It had a record of two victories, scoring 11 goals and conceding 5.

Teodoro Fernández scored Peru&#x27;s first goal in the tournament in the match against Finland on 6 August, and finished as the team&#x27;s top scorer with six goals in two games, including Peru&#x27;s only hat-trick at the Olympics.

The 1935 South American Championship in Lima acted as the qualifying stage for the 1936 Olympic tournament. Uruguay won undefeated and Argentina came second, but neither took up their Olympic spot because of economic issues. Peru, who had come third, represented South America. The Peruvian team began the competition with a 7–3 win over Finland, after which it faced Austria, managed by Jimmy Hogan and popularly known as the &quot;Wunderteam&quot;, in the quarter-finals. After the game ended 2–2, Peru scored twice in extra time to win 4–2. Peru expected to then face Poland in the semi-finals, but events off the pitch led to the withdrawal of Peru&#x27;s Olympic delegation before the match.

<text>Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte (; 25 December 1754 – 8 June 1840) was a minister in the government of the French First Republic. He was born in Metz.

At the outbreak of the Revolution he was a captain of cavalry, and his zeal led to his being made colonel and given the command at Cambrai. When Dumouriez delivered up to the Austrians the minister of war, the marquis de Beurnonville, in April 1793, Bouchotte, who had bravely defended Cambrai, was called by the Convention to be minister of war, where he remained until 31 March 1794.

The predominant role of the Committee of Public Safety during that period did not leave much scope for the new minister, yet he rendered some services in the organization of the republican armies, and chose his officers with insight, among them Kléber, Masséna, Moreau and Bonaparte.

During the Thermidorian Reaction, in spite of his incontestable honesty, he was accused by the anti-revolutionists. He was tried by the tribunal of the Eure-et-Loir and acquitted. Then he withdrew from politics, and lived in retirement until his death.

He left in 1992, disappointed with the government&#x27;s environmental direction. He received a law degree from the University of Manitoba in 1995, and ran an independent law practice for several years before joining the downtown Winnipeg law firm of Tupper &amp; Adams in 2004. His practice consists mainly of civil litigation. In late 2006, he moved to the firm of Pullan Kammerloch Frohlinger.

Buchart has been active with several environmental, peace and social justice groups, and was an editor and writer for the local environmental quarterly &quot;Links Magazine&quot; from 1989 to 1998. In one 1995 article, he wrote that Manitoba civil servants had been instructed to write environmental laws and regulations so as to ensure that the government would not be held liable for lax enforcement. He has repeatedly called for Manitoba to improve its water safety legislation, noting that the provincial Environment Act exempts farmland from its provisions. Buchart criticized a water safety bill introduced by Steve Ashton in 2004, arguing that while it would provide for effective testing, it would not prevent waste-runoff from entering the water system in the first place. He has also argued that the province ignored its own laws by allowing the City of Winnipeg to spray malathion against mosquitoes.

Buchart opposed the True North Entertainment Centre&#x27;s bid to construct an arena on the site of Winnipeg&#x27;s old Eaton&#x27;s building in 2002. He spearheaded a court challenge against the Assiniboine Credit Union&#x27;s decision to fund the project, describing the initiative as a risky venture for members (including himself). He later drew attention to the initial transfer of ownership for the Eaton&#x27;s building, which was permitted on a sworn value of $10 and resulted in the non-payment of a provincial land transfer tax. Following criticism, the government imposed a transfer tax of $100,000. The property was valued at five million dollars in a subsequent transfer of ownership.

==Political career==

Buchart describes himself as a &quot;blue-green&quot;, and is on the eco-capitalist wing of Canada&#x27;s green movement. He was chosen as the Manitoba Green Party&#x27;s first leader in 1999, one year after the party&#x27;s creation. The Manitoba Greens fielded six candidates in the 1999 provincial election, and Buchart ran against Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon in the Tuxedo constituency. He declared his support for small business in this election, arguing that small enterprises provide jobs for local economies and cause less pollution than large companies. He also drew attention to the fact that several municipalities in southeastern Manitoba were donating public tax revenues to political parties, a practice that he strongly criticized.

The Green Party ran fourteen candidates in the 2003 election, and ran a more visible campaign than in 1999. Buchart criticized the governing New Democratic Party&#x27;s stewardship of the environment, and said that his party would amend the provincial Parks Act to provide protection to all parks. He campaigned in the Wolseley constituency, and received 1,193 votes (19.5%) for a second-place finish against New Democrat Rob Altemeyer. No other GPM candidate received more than 7% support. Buchart&#x27;s leadership was challenged by Nelson Morrison in November 2004, but he handily retained his position.

Buchart resigned as party leader in March 2005, saying that Green Party meetings and committees were being disrupted by a small group of &quot;unruly and ungovernable&quot; radical members. Six other members of the party executive resigned at the same time. Buchart argued that his opponents were more interested in &quot;placard-waving protests&quot; than in building a serious political party.

Buchart announced the creation of the Winnipeg Green Party in May 2006, and campaigned under its banner in the 2006 municipal election. The City of Winnipeg does not officially recognize parties, and all municipal Green candidates appeared on the ballot as independents. In addition to promoting environmental goals, the Winnipeg Greens called for Video Lottery Terminals to be removed from all bars, restaurants and city-owned casinos.

Buchart supported Jim Harris&#x27;s tenure as leader of the federal Green Party, and campaigned for David Chernushenko to become Harris&#x27;s successor in 2006. Buchart is the personal lawyer of ex-Mayor candidate Alex &quot;Creampuff boy&quot; Reid.

<text>Pompeii is a novel by Robert Harris, published by Random House in 2003. It blends historical fiction with the real-life eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 24 August 79 AD, which overwhelmed the town of Pompeii and its vicinity. The novel is notable for its references to various aspects of volcanology and use of the Roman calendar. In 2007, a film adaptation was planned, to be directed by Roman Polanski with a budget of US$150 million, but was cancelled due to the threat of a looming actors&#x27; strike.

==Plot==
Marcus Attilius Primus arrives in the Bay of Naples from Rome to take charge as &quot;aquarius&quot; (hydraulic engineer) of the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that supplies water to the towns in the region encompassing the Bay of Naples and Mount Vesuvius. The nine important towns are, in order, Pompeii, Nola, Acerra, Atella, Napoli, Puteoli, Cumae, Baiae, and Miseno. Attilius&#x27;s predecessor, Exomnius, has mysteriously vanished as the springs that flow through the aqueduct begin to fail, which reduces the supply of water available to the region&#x27;s reservoir. Attilius is unpopular among the workers, particularly Corax, who resents the young foreigner giving him orders. Attilius&#x27;s concerns about the water are heightened when he is summoned by a young, wealthy woman, Corelia, to investigate water that apparently killed her father&#x27;s prized fish. Corelia&#x27;s father is the former slave and land speculator Numerius Popidius Ampliatus, who came to fortune after he rebuilt Pompeii from a past earthquake. Ampliatus feeds to eels the slave he deems responsible for the fish&#x27;s death for his own amusement. Attilius realises that unusually, sulfur poisoned the water.

Dramatically, the flow of water then stops entirely. Attilius concludes that the aqueduct must be blocked somewhere close to Mount Vesuvius since reports claim a shutdown of the system just before Nola. That means that towns from there through Napoli and Misenum are without any water supply. With aid from Pliny the Elder, whose fleet is docked at Misenum, Attilius assembles an expedition to travel to Pompeii, the closest town still being supplied with water, and then on to the blocked section of the Aqua Augusta.

While Attilius&#x27; expedition is there, he becomes embroiled as part of a plot by Ampliatus. Ampliatus plans to offer a cheap water supply to Pompeii, which Exomnius had helped him to do while he steals from the imperial treasury. Ampliatus tries to persuade Attilius to fill in Exomnius&#x27;s role, but he refuses.

Attilius&#x27;s questions and studies make Ampliatus suspicious, and the latter makes arrangements for Attilius to be assassinated. Attilius begins to suspect Ampliatus of bribery, suspicions that are supported by what Pliny the Elder and his nephew later discover: thousands of Roman sesterces at the bottom of the reservoir that should have gone to Rome. Attilius&#x27;s predecessor had intended to retrieve them once he had emptied the reservoir. Corelia gets Attilius the proof that he needs from her father&#x27;s written records when he is performing repairs to a collapsed section of tunnel in the region around Vesuvius. Attilius also discovers that Exomnius was investigating the phenomena around Vesuvius since he recognised some of them from his hometown of Catania after an eruption of Mount Etna. While exploring Vesuvius on his own, Attilius discovers Exomnius&#x27;s corpse in a pit of earth choked by noxious fumes, which also kills Corax, who has come to assassinate Attilius.

The eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 24 August overwhelms Pompeii, Oplontis, and Herculaneum. Attilius risks his life and comes back to Pompeii to find Corelia. A deranged Ampliatus refuses to evacuate, first holds his family and then Attilius captive and believes that he will become even richer and more powerful by rebuilding the city once more after it is destroyed. Attilius rescues Corelia but is pursued by Ampliatus and his men, even as pyroclastic flows begin to descend on Pompeii. Attilius and Corelia enter the aqueduct and dig their way to safety. Ampliatus is killed by the overwhelming heat of the pyroclastic flow, along with the rest of his family and the rest of the expedition. Pliny dies from the effects of the fumes while he tries to evacuate the household of a friend at the nearby town of Stabiae.

Pompeii is buried underneath rocks, pumice, ash, and volcanic material and leaves few survivors. The last sentence of the novel reports a local legend that a man and woman had emerged from the aqueduct after the eruption, which implies that Attilius and Corelia likely survived the trip up the aqueduct.

The incident of Ampliatus feeding a slave to his eels is based on the actual historical case of Vedius Pollio.

==Comparison with the United States==
The novel&#x27;s motto combines two quotes, from Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Hooking Up&quot; and from the &quot;Natural History&quot; of Pliny the Elder (who, as noted, is a central character in the book itself), with both writers speaking in nearly identical terms of the preeminence of, respectively, the present United States and the Roman Empire, over the rest of the world.

The theme of comparing ancient Rome to the contemporary United States is repeated throughout the book, for example in the deliberate use of typically American terminology, as when Attilius regards Pompeii as &quot;a hustling boomtown&quot; while Ampliatus boasts that &quot;I am the man who runs this town.&quot;

Attilius himself is an example of a &quot;modern&quot; character, a typical proponent of the problem solving approach – a pragmatic engineer, who has little use for religion or gods but an unbounded confidence in the ability of sound Roman engineering and science to solve problems – given a thorough knowledge of natural laws, good planning and a firm leadership, all of which he is fully capable of providing.

==Cancelled film adaptation==
In 2007, together with studio, Harris wrote a screenplay based on &quot;Pompeii&quot; for director Roman Polanski. Harris acknowledged in many interviews that the plot of his novel was inspired by Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and Polanski said it was precisely that similarity that had attracted him to &quot;Pompeii&quot;. The film, to be produced by Summit Entertainment, was announced at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 as potentially the most expensive European film ever made, set to be shot in Spain. Media reports suggested Polanski wanted Orlando Bloom and Scarlett Johansson to play the two leads. The film was cancelled in September 2007 due to delays caused by location and script problems as well as fears of a looming actors&#x27; strike.

<text>Jed Allan Brown (March 1, 1935 – March 9, 2019), known professionally as Jed Allan, was an American actor and television host, best known as C.C. Capwell on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, Don Craig on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Rush Sanders on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, Scott Turner on &quot;Lassie&quot;, Harold Johnson on &quot;The Bay&quot;, and the host of &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Education and early career===
Allan attended the University of Washington, where he majored in Drama. While in college, he supported himself working as a radio and television announcer and sportscaster. In the 1960s, he appeared in several Broadway productions such as &quot;Viva Madison Avenue!&quot;, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;.

===Daytime television roles===
Allan starred in several soap operas. He made his debut as trouble-making Ace Hubbard on &quot;Love of Life&quot; in 1964. He played college professor Paul Britton on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; in 196465. Allan was one of many actors to play Paul, who was involved with the show&#x27;s leading heroine, Amy Ames. Allan replaced his future &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; co-star Nicolas Coster in the part. He is best known for his role as Don Craig in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, which he played from 1971 to 1985, his exit taking place as many of the show&#x27;s veteran cast members were being written out so the show could focus on younger characters. His departure from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; was unpopular among his fans. His character was abruptly written out with minor explanation. He gained a new audience when he took over the role of C. C. Capwell in &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1986 to 1993. After his time on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, Allan had a recurring role in &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; playing Rush Sanders.

In 2004, he started playing the role of Edward Quartermaine in &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

===Other projects===
Allan&#x27;s most notable television role outside of soap operas was when he starred on &quot;Lassie&quot; from 1968 to 1970 as Forest Ranger Scott Turner, who along with fellow ranger Bob Erickson (played by Jack De Mave) served as the collie dog&#x27;s main human companion during that period.

He appeared in numerous made-for-television movies. He hosted &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot; during the 1970s as well as a game show pilot, &quot;Temptation&quot;, in 1981 for Ralph Andrews and Columbia Pictures Television.

Allan was a featured character in several episodes of &quot;Adam-12&quot;. He played Reno West, a prolific burglar who was known as, &quot;Take a little, leave a little&quot; because of his M.O. He was finally caught by Reed and Malloy in the episode &#x27;Capture&#x27; (season 6, episode 9).

Allan wrote a book, &quot;Please, Spell the Name Right&quot;, in reference to his name often being spelled incorrectly. The book is about his experiences of 50 years as an actor working with other actors and was released in November 2004.
He also played Mr. Marraco in the Carman film, The Champion.

==Personal life and death==
Allan was married to Toby Brown from September 21, 1958 until her death in 2001. The couple had three sons, Mitch, Dean, and Rick. Allan lived in Palm Desert, California.

He died on March 9, 2019, eight days after his 84th birthday.

<text>Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville (10 May 1752 – 23 April 1821) was a French general during the French Revolutionary Wars and later a marshal of France and Deputy Grand Master of Grand Orient de France.

==Biography==
Bournonville was born at Champignol-lez-Mondeville, Aube.

After service in the colonies, he married a wealthy Creole, Geneviève Gillot L&#x27;Étang. After his return to France, he purchased the post of lieutenant of the Swiss Guard of the count of Provence.

During the French Revolution he was named lieutenant-general, and took an active part in the battles of Valmy and Jemmapes. Minister of War in February 1793, he denounced his old commander, Charles François Dumouriez, to the Convention, and was one of the four deputies sent to watch him.

Handed over by Dumouriez to the Austrians on 3 April 1793, Beurnonville was not exchanged until November 1795. He entered the service again, commanded the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse and Army of the North, and was appointed inspector of infantry of the Army of England in 1798. He was sent as ambassador to Berlin in 1800, and to Madrid in 1802.

Napoleon made him a senator and count of the empire. In 1814 he was a member of the provisional government organized after the abdication of Napoleon. He followed Louis XVIII to exile in Ghent, and after the second restoration was made marquis and marshal of France (1816).

<text>Peterculter , also known as Culter, is an outer suburb of Aberdeen, Scotland, about from the city centre. It lies on the north bank of the River Dee, at its confluence with the Culter Burn. Following the 1996 Scottish council boundary changes it became part of the Lower Deeside ward in the Aberdeen City council area.

==History==
About south west of Peterculter is the site of the Roman marching camp at Normandykes.

King William the Lion bestowed the church of Kulter, &quot;iuxta Abirdene&quot;, upon the Abbey and monks of St Mary of Kelso, about 1165–1199. The gift was afterwards confirmed by Mathew, Bishop of Aberdeen, within whose diocese the church sat.

Alan of Soltre, chaplain, who had probably been an ecclesiastic of the hospital, or monastery of Soutra, in Lothian, was presented by the Abbot of Kelso, to the vicarage of the church of Culter, 1239–1240.

In 1287–1288, an agreement was made between the Abbot and Convent of Kelso and the brotherhood of the Knights of Jerusalem, regarding the Templars&#x27; lands of Blairs and Kincolsi (Kincousie, now Kincaussie), on the south side of the Dee, by which a chapel, built by the Templars at their house of Culter, was recognised as a church, with parochial rights, for the inhabitants of the said lands. It was this agreement that changed the existing parish of Culter into two separate parishes with two separate names, the other being Maryculter.

==Attractions==
High up on the steep, rocky bank of the Culter Burn, near the western exit of the town, was a colourful and well-tended kilted wooden figure holding a broadsword and targe, representing Rob Roy Macgregor, who, according to local legend, leapt across the burn at that point to flee pursuing Hanoverian troops (given the width of the stream there, the story - which has its local variants in many parts of Scotland - is unlikely to have much basis in fact). The outlaw Gilderoy is a more likely historical figure for the story. The original statue is thought to have been a modified ship&#x27;s figurehead. The statue was replaced in 2017 by a resin effigy, wearing ancient Macgregor tartan.

Due to its nearness to Aberdeen City and being only about from the Cairngorm National Park, Culter is a base for tourists. In the town itself there are choices of many local walks, including its connection to the Deeside Way at the site of the former Culter railway station, as well as the forest area known locally as &quot;Sandy Hilly&quot;, or &quot;The Muggie Widds&quot; (St. Margaret Woods), the entrance to which sits beside the Bucklerburn region.

For sport, there is Peterculter Golf Club and Culter Sports Centre. Each year, on the last Saturday in May, is the Culter Gala, in the main playing field of the town; this event draws hundreds of local townsfolk.

==Education==
Culter School is a primary school in Peterculter dating from 1896.

<text>Dallas Page (born Page Joseph Falkinburg Jr., April 5, 1956), is an American fitness instructor, actor, and retired professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE under a Legends contract, under the ring name Diamond Dallas Page (often shortened to DDP). In the course of his wrestling career Page has wrestled for mainstream wrestling promotions World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and All Elite Wrestling (AEW).

Page first broke into the wrestling business in 1979, in which he wrestled three matches. He retired after a knee injury, however. In 1988, he returned to wrestling as a manager in the American Wrestling Association, where he worked for nine months before signing with WCW in 1991. There, he continued as a manager until late 1991, when he became a wrestler. Over a decade in WCW, Page became a three-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, two-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion, four-time WCW World Tag Team Champion and one-time WCW World Television Champion. He is the fourth WCW Triple Crown Champion, and the only United States Heavyweight Champion to defend the title in a pay-per-view main event, defeating Bret Hart at the 1998 World War 3.

After WCW was sold in 2001, Page signed with the WWF where he made his pay-per-view debut in the main event of July&#x27;s Invasion show, and went on to become a one-time WWF European Champion and one-time WWF World Tag Team Champion. Due to a series of injuries, he allowed his contract with the company to expire in 2002. He worked for TNA from 2004 to 2005, challenging for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Destination X 2005. On March 31, 2017, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Eric Bischoff. He is considered &quot;one of the finest WCW legends in history.&quot;

Since 2012, Page has run a mail order and online fitness video business called DDP Yoga, based on yoga and dynamic self-resistance.

== Early life ==

Page Joseph Falkinburg Jr., the eldest of three children, was born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, the son of Sylvia (née Seigel) and Page Falkinburg Sr. He was raised by his father during his early years after his parents divorced. He stated that he is of German, Irish, and Dutch origin. Falkinburg/Falkenburg is also the name of multiple German villages and at least three German castles. The name &quot;Dallas&quot; came from his love of the Dallas Cowboys.

His brother Rory and sister Sally were raised by their maternal grandmother. Falkinburg lived with his father from age three to eight. His father took him, at eight years old, to live with his grandmother, who raised him. Falkinburg admitted in his autobiography he is dyslexic. He had many challenges hit him throughout his childhood and educational years.

He attended St. Joseph&#x27;s High School (now Donovan Catholic High School) in Toms River, New Jersey, for his freshman and second years, spending his first season on the JV basketball team and making the varsity squad as a sophomore. He transferred to Point Pleasant Borough High School in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, where he was a star basketball player with the Panthers. He attended Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina briefly before leaving school to work full-time.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== First Matches (1979) ===
In 1979, Page wrestled in three matches. He retired after a knee injury.

=== American Wrestling Association (1988) ===
Page ran a nightclub in Fort Myers, Florida called Norma Jeans (known for its pink Cadillac) while he was working as a wrestling manager in the American Wrestling Association (AWA). He started managing in 1988, where he handled Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka), a team he led to the AWA World Tag Team Championship on March 19. Badd Company was often accompanied by female valets known as the &quot;Diamond Dolls&quot; (Tonya, Jennifer and Torri). During his time in the AWA, Page also managed Colonel DeBeers, Curt Hennig and Madusa Miceli as the leader of the Diamond Exchange stable. He worked for the AWA at 12 dates over a period of nine months, where they filmed all the television shows in one day.

=== Professional Wrestling Federation (19891991) ===
Page also worked as a color commentator in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), soon renamed Professional Wrestling Federation (PWF), where he worked alongside Gordon Solie, before finally debuting as a professional wrestler. Page&#x27;s first pro match occurred in May 1989 against Dick Slater.

In 1990, Page received a tryout with the WWF as an announcer, but wasn&#x27;t offered a job. At WrestleMania VI, he drove Rhythm and Blues (The Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine) to the ring in his pink Cadillac. At this time, he was virtually unknown in the World Wrestling Federation. When FCW went out of business, Page was still involved in the club business until Dusty Rhodes returned to World Championship Wrestling. Rhodes started booking and brought him in on a small contract in early 1991.

===World Championship Wrestling/WCW (1991–2001)===

==== Various alliances (1991–1993) ====

Page came to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in January 1991 to become the manager of The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Michael P.S. Hayes). He made his debut on February 3, 1991, on The Main Event, when Paul E. Dangerously introduced Page to the audience in an interview on the show&#x27;s wrestling news segment &quot;The Danger Zone&quot;. Page managed the Freebirds to a shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship where they defeated Doom (Butch Reed and Ron Simmons) on February 24. Before that match took place, Page unveiled the stable&#x27;s new road manager, Big Daddy Dink, formerly known as Oliver Humperdink, who interfered in the match. During this match, Page introduced the &quot;Diamond Dolls&quot;. In April 1991 he added Scott Hall to the stable under the name of Diamond Studd. Page also worked as a color commentator for WCW with Eric Bischoff. With rumors that the WCW wanted to take the Diamond Studd away from Page, he decided to take the advice of Magnum T. A. and begin to wrestle himself. He headed to the WCW Power Plant where Buddy Lee Parker, The Assassin, and Dusty Rhodes trained the 35-year-old rookie. The advice was fruitful, as on the August 31, 1991 episode it was announced by commentators that the Studd and Page had indeed parted ways.

Dallas Page would make his debut as a wrestler on August 22, 1991, at a house show in Jacksonville, FL, losing to Tom Zenk in 90 seconds. As he continued his training Page became a commentator for WCW programming. He also resumed managing Scott Hall; however, he would not return to the ring until November 25, 1991, when he teamed with The Diamond Studd to defeat Chris Sullivan and Brian Lee on WCW World Championship Wrestling (the future WCW Saturday Night). At the same taping, but in a match airing on December 21, 1991, on WCW Pro, Studd and Page would gain their first significant victory when they defeated PN News and Johnny B. Badd. On the house show circuit, Page and Studd suffered their first defeat when they fell to the WCW Patriots in Baltimore, MD on November 27. On the December 21 edition of &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot;, Dallas accomplished his first single victory, defeating Johnny Rich. Later that month he faced former clients Michael Hayes and Jim Garvin in house show matches, losing each encounter.

He made his wrestling pay-per-view debut at Starrcade in 1991, teaming with Mike Graham in a losing effort to Jushin Thunder Liger and Bill Kazmaier. In regards to this period, he stated:
&quot;Bischoff gave me the job as I was a good example of work ethic, passion and someone that cares about the business. Since they wouldn&#x27;t really book me, I went down to the WCW Power Plant every day I wasn&#x27;t working. That&#x27;s how you adapt to adversity. Even when I started to make it, I still kept going back. Until I was on the road 260 days a year-plus, I was still going to that Power Plant. For five years I went there, because that&#x27;s how long it took me to get to the top.&quot;

Page opened 1992 with a house show victory over Brad Anderson in Atlanta, GA, making his wrestling debut at The Omni. This would be his only victory for some time, as the former manager began to wrestle full-time but quickly found himself relegated to the &quot;jobber&quot; list. Page would make his debut at Clash of the Champions, losing to PN News at Clash of the Champions XVIII. He would also lose matches to Ron Simmons, The Steiner Brothers, Barry Windham &amp; Dustin Rhodes, Van Hammer, The Freebirds, Nikita Koloff and Tom Zenk. On February 29, 1992, he was defeated by Big Josh in the opening dark match at the SuperBrawl II PPV.

In April 1992 he began teaming with Richard Morton (Ricky Morton) following the dissolution of The York Foundation. The duo faced Ron Simmons &amp; The Junkyard Dog, The Steiner Brothers and The Freebirds on the house show circuit but were unsuccessful. On the April 25, 1992 episode of WCW Worldwide it was announced that Kip Frey had banned Page from any non-wrestling appearances in WCW, and ultimately eliminated his wrestling license. Meanwhile, on April 30, 1992, he garnered his first significant singles victory of his nascent career when he pinned Marcus Alexander Bagwell at a house show in West Palm Beach, Fl.

World Championship Wrestling announced a tournament to crown the NWA World Tag Team Champions on May 2, 1992; Dallas Page proceeded to crash the event and brought bags of letters of support for overturning his ban. Kip Frey relented, and Page had his TV time and wrestling license restored. He teamed with Thomas Rich to defeat Firebreaker Chip and Bob Cook in the dark match of WrestleWar &#x27;92 on May 17, 1992. On the June 13, 1992 edition of WCW Saturday Night he faced WCW World Heavyweight Champion Sting in a non-title matchup and was defeated. On June 20, he teamed with Tracy Smothers and Richard Morton in a losing effort to The Junkyard Dog, Tom Zenk, and Big Josh in the dark match of Beach Blast 92.

Page continued to wrestle and gradually brought other wrestlers into his stable, The Diamond Mine, such as Scotty Flamingo (Raven) and Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash). The relationships between DDP, Flamingo, and Vegas were used in many angles over the following months. Page went in the corner of Scotty Flamingo, at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXI&quot; on November 18, 1992, when Flamingo fought Johnny B. Badd in a worked boxing match. Flamingo won this bout with a little help from Page who filled Flamingo&#x27;s glove with water. The following year, after Studd and Flamingo left the stable, Page teamed with Vinnie Vegas as the Vegas Connection. The team was disbanded shortly after its debut when Page tore a rotator cuff in a match against Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce toward the end of 1992 and was later fired, while Nash left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation.

==== World Television Champion and feud with Randy Savage (1993–1997) ====
Page, determined to continue improving his character, sought the help of Jake Roberts who advised him on the psychological aspects of the business. After his injury had healed and following a tour of Germany for World Wrestling Superstars in the summer of 1993, Page re-signed with World Championship Wrestling. He made his return on the December 19, 1993 edition of The Main Event, losing to Scott D&#x27;Amore via countout. He closed the year by defeating &quot;Jungle&quot; Jim Steele at a house show in Kennesaw, GA 

Page had returned with his wife Kimberly as the Diamond Doll, and an on-screen bodyguard, Max Muscle. He held open arm wrestling challenges to win Kimberly, but Max always helped him win or arm wrestled for him. He was also involved in an angle where he was said to have amassed $13 million through victories in arm wrestling competitions, then lost it. In summer 1995, he feuded with Dave Sullivan because Sullivan gave Kimberly gifts (and largely because Page was defeated by Sullivan in one of the arm wrestling contests, which earned him a date with Kimberly). At Fall Brawl, Page won his first championship when he defeated Renegade for the WCW World Television Championship. In the build-up to his first title defence at Halloween Havoc, there was growing dissension between Page and Kimberly. Johnny B. Badd defeated Page for the TV title and again at World War 3 on November 26, winning Kimberly&#x27;s freedom from DDP. At Uncensored on March 24, 1996 The Booty Man with Kimberly as The Booty Babe defeated Diamond Dallas Page in a Loser Leaves Town match.
Page returned on the May 18, 1996 episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; as a tweener defeating Billy Kidman. On May 19, Page participated in the Lord of the Ring Tournament (Battle Bowl) at Slamboree. Falkinburg was victorious when he defeated The Barbarian with two Diamond Cutters. The winner was to be the number one contender for the World Title which at that time was held by The Giant. He never received the title shot that he earned that night. Page was feuding with Eddie Guerrero when the New World Order (nWo) was formed. Since Nash and Hall were both former partners of Page, they assisted him in his matches in the tournament being held for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship. Believing their assistance was not appreciated, Hall and Nash attacked him during the tournament final, allowing Guerrero to win. After demonstrating the benefits of the nWo, they asked him to join. He responded by giving them Diamond Cutters on January 25, 1997, at Souled Out, starting a face turn and a feud with the nWo. Soon after, Page began a feud with recent nWo recruit &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. On an episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Savage, aided by Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, attacked Page and spray-painted &quot;nWo&quot; on his back. A few weeks later at Uncensored, Savage and Miss Elizabeth &quot;broke&quot; (a worked shoot) by revealing to the world that Page and Kimberly were, in fact, married. Savage then proceeded to beat up Page, ensuring a future match between the two. At Spring Stampede, in Page&#x27;s first pay-per-view main event, he and Savage battled in a match where Page emerged victorious, but it was not the end of conflict between the two. A few months later at The Great American Bash, they squared off again in an anything goes, lights out match. The match ended with Savage defeating Page with help from (then) Tag Team Champion Scott Hall. At Bash at the Beach, Scott Hall and Randy Savage defeated Diamond Dallas Page and Curt Hennig. Curt Hennig, who Diamond Dallas Page had recruited personally to join WCW and team with him, turned on DDP during the match. Hennig defeated Diamond Dallas Page in a grudge match at Road Wild. At Fall Brawl, Page teamed with Lex Luger to defeat Scott Hall and Randy Savage in a No Disqualification match. Page even dressed up as masked wrestler La Parka and beat Savage on the July 7 edition of Monday Nitro. Around this time, Page also started fighting nWo leader, Hollywood Hogan. Page and Savage battled for the last time at Halloween Havoc. The match was billed as a Las Vegas sudden-death match, where Savage pinned Page after Hogan, dressed as Sting, came out and hit Page with a baseball bat in his already &quot;injured&quot; midsection, resulting in Savage picking up the win. On an episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; shortly after Halloween Havoc, Page fought Hogan, but was again beaten down by the nWo.

==== United States Heavyweight Champion (1997–1998) ====
At Starrcade, Page won the United States Heavyweight Championship from Curt Hennig. The following year at Uncensored, Page defended the title in a Triple Threat, Falls Count Anywhere contest against Chris Benoit and Raven, putting Raven through a table with a Diamond Cutter to retain the belt. Page later lost the title to Raven at Spring Stampede. Later in the year, Page tagged with Karl Malone against Hulk Hogan and Dennis Rodman at Bash at the Beach, losing due to interference. Page tagged with late night talk show host Jay Leno at Road Wild, where they defeated Hogan and Eric Bischoff.

Page, along with Raven and the Flock, were featured in the music video for the song &quot;Rising&quot; by the band Stuck Mojo. At Fall Brawl, Page won the WarGames main event, and got a World title shot against the undefeated Goldberg at Halloween Havoc. Page did not win the match, but the match was voted &quot;WCW Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Match of the Year&quot; 1998. Halloween Havoc ran slightly longer than expected resulting in a number of cable companies blacking out the end of the Hogan versus Warrior match and all of the DDP versus Goldberg contest. WCW decided to air the Goldberg versus DDP title bout in its entirety on the October 26 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, which proved immensely popular in the ratings and resulted in a ratings win for &quot;Nitro&quot; over &quot;Raw&quot; – the last win &quot;Nitro&quot; ever had. Despite this setback in the World title picture, Page rebounded this same following night of Halloween Havoc, on the October 26 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, with a win over Bret Hart to capture the United States Heavyweight Title. The two headlined the following month&#x27;s World War 3, in a title match which Page won. Page lost the title to Hart on the November 30 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; in a No Disqualification match, when he was assaulted by The Giant.

==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1999–2001) ====

Page became WCW World Heavyweight Champion in April 1999, at Spring Stampede when he defeated Sting, Hogan, and Ric Flair for the title in a Four Way Dance with &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage as Special Guest Referee. Page pinned Flair after giving Flair the Diamond Cutter. Around this time some fans were starting to boo Page at various WCW events, so shortly after Spring Stampede a decision was made to turn Page heel for the first time in three years. The turn played out slowly at first, with Page undergoing a change in attitude. Then, on April 19, Page defended his title against Goldberg, where he cemented the turn by first knocking Goldberg out with brass knuckles and then propping his leg up against the ring stairs and repeatedly smashing it with a steel chair, all while taunting the fans with repeated utterances of &quot;boo me now&quot;. Page only stopped when Kevin Nash, an ally of Hogan&#x27;s who was angry at Page for (kayfabe) injuring Hogan&#x27;s knee during the match at Spring Stampede, came back from injury and chased him away.

On April 26, 1999, Page lost and regained his title in the span of two hours. Sting challenged him to defend his title in the first hour of that night&#x27;s &quot;Nitro&quot; and defeated him to regain the title he had lost a year earlier. This ended Page&#x27;s reign at 15 days, but he gained an opportunity to get the title back ninety minutes later. Nash came to the ring and made a challenge for a four-way match for the title, and the just-dethroned Page joined defending champion Sting and Goldberg in the match. Page regained the WCW World Heavyweight Championship by using a foreign object to hit Nash and take the win and regain the title without actually defeating the reigning champion. Nash became the number one contender shortly after and vowed to get revenge on Page for his friend Hogan, culminating in a match at Slamboree in May. Page originally retained the WCW World Heavyweight Championship after Savage interfered and hit Nash, but the match was ordered to continue by Eric Bischoff and Nash pinned Page to win the title after a powerbomb. Page dropped out of the title picture shortly thereafter.

Shortly after Slamboree, Page entered into an alliance with fellow New Jerseyan Bam Bam Bigelow and won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from then champions Perry Saturn and Raven on May 31, thanks to Chris Kanyon turning heel on former ally Raven and costing the team the championships. Page, Bigelow, and Kanyon became known as the Jersey Triad and through their alliance with WCW &quot;President for Life&quot; Ric Flair took advantage of the Freebird Rule in their subsequent matches (meaning any combination of the three could defend the championship). The Triad held the titles until June 10, when Saturn and Chris Benoit (now stablemates in The Revolution) took the title from them. They regained the belts at The Great American Bash three days later, and lost them to Harlem Heat at Road Wild in August. Later that night, Chris Benoit defeated Diamond Dallas Page to retain the United States title. The group broke up shortly thereafter and Page began feuding with Hogan again, joining Sid Vicious and Rick Steiner in a team effort to take on Hogan, Sting, and Goldberg. Soon after that feud ended Page turned into a hero again and feuded with both Kanyon and Bigelow before the year ended.

In 2000, with WCW under new management, Page earned a shot at the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Spring Stampede against Jeff Jarrett. In a surprise twist, Page&#x27;s wife, Kimberly, turned on Page and helped Jarrett become the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Page got the better of Jarrett on the April 24 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, where he defeated Jarrett in a steel cage match to become WCW World Heavyweight Champion for the third time, then lost the title to his tag partner, actor David Arquette, three days later on &quot;Thunder&quot;; the rules stated that whoever got the pin would win the title, and Arquette pinned Jarrett&#x27;s partner, Eric Bischoff. Page attempted to win the title back at Slamboree later that month in a triple cage match against Arquette and Jarrett, but lost after Arquette hit him with a guitar. Page then entered a feud with Mike Awesome, who defeated him in an Ambulance Match at The Great American Bash after Kanyon turned on Page.

Page took some time off shortly after this, but returned in late 2000 as a full-time wrestler. After Page came back he formed a tag team with Kevin Nash called The Insiders, and the team won the WCW World Tag Team Championship on November 26 at Mayhem by defeating Perfect Event (Shawn Stasiak and Chuck Palumbo). The team was temporarily stripped of the titles but won them back at Starrcade defeating Stasiak and Palumbo again. Page and Nash lost the titles to Palumbo and Sean O&#x27;Haire at Sin in January and broke up shortly thereafter. After his tag team run Page briefly feuded with the returning Kanyon, which saw Kanyon defeat Page at SuperBrawl Revenge, and Page defeating Kanyon the following night on Nitro, ending their feud. Page then moved into the World Championship picture again by facing Scott Steiner. Their feud hit a climax at WCW&#x27;s final PPV Greed, saw Page&#x27;s final match in WCW as he passed out in Steiner&#x27;s finisher, The Steiner Recliner, after refusing to tap out.

=== World Wrestling Federation (2001–2002) ===
When WCW was purchased by WWF owner Vince McMahon in 2001, Page was one of the few major WCW stars (along with Booker T and Buff Bagwell) who accepted buyouts of their AOL Time Warner contracts in order to immediately sign with McMahon. He debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on the June 18, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when he unveiled himself as the stalker of The Undertaker&#x27;s wife, Sara. Page revealed he didn&#x27;t care about Sara; he only did it to make an impact and wanted to take on the &quot;biggest dog in the yard&quot;. At King of the Ring, he fought The Undertaker in an unsanctioned brawl that was never announced as an official match. On the July 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Page competed against WCW Champion Booker T, but failed to win the title after a distraction from the Undertaker. On the July 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, WCW owner Shane McMahon and ECW owner Paul Heyman joined to create The Alliance, with former WCW and ECW alumni joining forces in an attempt to take control of the WWF. At the Invasion pay-per-view, Page formed part of Team Alliance alongside Booker T, Rhyno and The Dudley Boyz, defeating Team WWF, after Team WWF member Stone Cold Steve Austin turned on his team members mid-match.

Page and Chris Kanyon reunited on the August 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Kanyon helped Page attack The Undertaker backstage. Three days later on the August 9 taping of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Page and Kanyon defeated the APA to win the WWF Tag Team Championship.

His feud with the Undertaker culminated when Undertaker and Kane defeated Page and Kanyon at SummerSlam on August 19, 2001, in a Steel cage match for the WWF Tag Team Championship. During the match, Page was injured, keeping him out of action until late October 2001. While Page was injured, he developed a new gimmick in which he became a motivational speaker. The character involved Page constantly smiling and acting optimistic, with his trademark phrase &quot;That&#x27;s not a bad thing... that&#x27;s... a good thing&quot;.

His return televised match was on November 3 at Rebellion losing to Big Show. After the Alliance lost at Survivor Series, Page, along with the rest of the Alliance members, kayfabe lost their jobs.

Page eventually returned as a face and won his job back by defeating Big Boss Man on the January 17, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Page competed in the Royal Rumble match at the titular event on January 20 but did not win.

Page became the WWF European Champion on the January 31, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when he defeated Christian, a former follower of his positive &quot;philosophy.&quot; At WrestleMania X8, Page successfully retained in a rematch against Christian. He lost the title to William Regal on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; that aired March 21. On March 25, Page was drafted to the SmackDown! brand as part of the 2002 WWF draft lottery.

On the April 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he sustained a serious neck injury during a match with Hardcore Holly, after botching a superplex. After receiving opinions from multiple doctors, Page announced his retirement in June 2002. He left the promotion soon after.

=== Return to Wrestling (2004) ===
In 2004, Page made his in-ring return by wrestling for several independent promotions. His first match was on April 21, 2004, teaming with Satoshi Kojima as they lost to former WCW star Sting and The Great Muta for HCW Battle Hawaii.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2005) ===
He signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He debuted for the company on the November 12 taping of &quot;Impact!&quot;, where he attacked Raven, beginning a feud between the two. At Turning Point on December 5, DDP defeated Raven.
and at Final Resolution in January 2005, Page competed in a three-way elimination match to determine the number one contender for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship also involving Monty Brown and Kevin Nash, which was won by Brown. Page and Brown subsequently formed a tag team. The following month at Against All Odds, Page and Brown defeated Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young). Page received an NWA World Heavyweight Championship title shot on March 13 at Destination X, but was defeated by reigning champion Jeff Jarrett when Brown turned heel and hit Page with the Pounce. At Lockdown, Page teamed with B.G. James and Waltman to defeat Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown and The Outlaw in a Lethal Lockdown match. At Hard Justice on May 15, Page and Ron Killings faced Monty Brown and The Outlaw where they were defeated in what was Page&#x27;s final match in TNA. Page left TNA shortly thereafter in order to pursue an acting career.

=== Independent circuit (2005–2011) ===
After TNA, Page returned to the independent circuit. He lost to Larry Zbyszko at WrestleReunion. DDP had Bruno Sammartino in his corner during the match. Then Page defeated Buff Bagwell on December 9, 2005, at GLCW Blizzard Brawl. In 2006, Page defeated his former Jersey Triad partner Chris Kanyon twice before retiring once again.

On August 9, 2009, Diamond Dallas Page made a special appearance for Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW) at their Bloodymania III event, aligning himself with the jWo. He hit his trademark Diamond Cutter finisher on Trent Acid.

DDP returned to wrestling on January 2, 2010, teaming with Air Paris to defeat Bobby Hayes and Alexander the Great at PICW event. On October 15, 2011, DDP teamed with Kevin Nash as they defeated The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express at AWE Night Of The Legends.

=== Return to WWE (2011–2017, 2024–present) ===

In late 2010, Page agreed to work on a DVD for WWE, titled &quot;The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, after being approached on the project due to his ties to WCW. Page hosted the DVD, which was released on June 7, 2011. On the June 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Page made an appearance promoting this DVD with Booker T.

In 2012, Page appeared on WWE Classics on Demand in &quot;Legends of Wrestling Roundtable: Renegades&quot; along with Jim Ross, Michael P.S. Hayes, Roddy Piper, and Gene Okerlund. Page also appeared alongside Kevin Nash and X-Pac at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony on March 31, 2012. On July 2, 2012, Page made an appearance on &quot;Raw&quot;, where he hit a Diamond Cutter on Heath Slater. He also appeared at &quot;Raw 1000&quot;, accompanied by other WWE Legends, during Slater&#x27;s match with Lita.

On the January 6, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Page, along with a number of other legends, appeared on the show as part of its &quot;Old School&quot; theme. On April 5, Page inducted his wrestling mentor and noted DDP Yoga practitioner Jake Roberts into the WWE Hall of Fame.

On January 25, 2015, at Royal Rumble, Page was a surprise entrant in the Rumble match, entering at number 14 and hitting his finishing move, the Diamond Cutter, on Stardust, Bray Wyatt and Fandango from the top rope, before being eliminated by Rusev. At WrestleMania 32, Page competed in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, but was eliminated by Konnor.

On March 31, 2017, Page was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in Orlando, Florida.

On October 6, 2024, Page announced via his Twitter that he had signed with WWE under a legend contract after his appearance in the crowds at the Bad Blood PPV event.

=== All In (2018) ===
At All In on September 1, 2018, Page accompanied Cody Rhodes in his match against NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion Nick Aldis.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2019–2020) ===
On May 25, 2019, during their inaugural pay-per-view Double or Nothing, Page escorted Brandi Rhodes away from the ring after she refused to leave the match between Cody Rhodes and Dustin Rhodes after match referee Earl Hebner ejected her from the match. On the October 23, 2019, episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, Page returned to TNT programming for the first time in over 18 years, and helped Cody attack Chris Jericho and his stable The Inner Circle. On November 27, 2019, Page returned to &quot;Dynamite&quot; to present MJF with the first ever &quot;Dynamite Diamond Ring&quot; as a prize for defeating Adam Page. On January 15, 2020, at Bash at the Beach, Page had his last match, teaming with Dustin Rhodes and Q. T. Marshall to take on MJF and The Butcher and The Blade in a losing effort.

== Yoga ==
Page developed a yoga fitness program initially called &quot;Yoga for Regular Guys Workout&quot; (&quot;YRG&quot;), after discovering the health benefits of yoga through his then-wife Kimberly while he recovered from ruptures to his L4/L5 discs in 1998. His favorite kind of yoga (according to his &quot;Yoga for Regular Guys&quot; book published in 2005) is &quot;Power Yoga&quot;, an American-style version of &quot;Ashtanga Style&quot; yoga. Page worked with chiropractor Dr. Craig Aaron, and developed the &quot;Yoga for Regular Guys Workout&quot;.

Page developed the book into a series of workout videos titled DDP Yoga (formerly YRG). DDP Yoga was featured in a video about Arthur Boorman in May 2012. The story was picked up by the mainstream media, including &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. The video describes the journey of Arthur Boorman, a disabled veteran who was told by doctors he would never walk again. After spending fifteen years on crutches, Boorman followed Page&#x27;s yoga plan for ten months and documented his progress on home video. He lost 140 pounds and regained the strength and flexibility to walk and run without his crutches, back braces or leg braces.

On February 21, 2014, Page appeared on the ABC series &quot;Shark Tank&quot;, where he was seeking $200,000 for a 5% share in the DDP Yoga company. He declined to sell a 50% share for that same amount to Kevin O&#x27;Leary. Page had hoped to use the money to develop a mobile app. The other investors were impressed by Boorman&#x27;s improvement but believed the home exercise market was too competitive and also predicted net profits ($800,000 in the previous year) would fall. Page later said he sold more than $1 million worth of products in the first six days after his appearance.

==Documentaries and podcast==
In 2015, he was a main subject in the documentary &quot;The Resurrection of Jake the Snake&quot;, which chronicled Page helping Jake Roberts through rehabilitation.

In 2016, Page was featured on the &quot;Nine Legends&quot; Expansion Pack to talk about his friend Bill Goldberg.

Page currently hosts a radio show titled &quot;DDP Radio&quot;. Since January 4, 2022, Page has taken part in a podcast with Jake Roberts and Conrad Thompson titled &quot;DDP Snakepit&quot;.

== Lawsuits ==

Page is commonly associated with the &quot;Self High Five&quot; as well as the &quot;Diamond Cutter&quot; symbol, a hand gesture made by joining the thumbs and index fingers on each hand to form a diamond shape, then parting the two hands in one swift motion. He created the symbol in 1996 and later trademarked it. In December 2005, Page filed a lawsuit against rapper Jay-Z, who, he claimed, had &quot;illegally adopted his trademark hand gesture&quot;. Page accused Jay-Z of trademark infringement and sought a prohibitive injunction and monetary damages. It resulted in Page dropping the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount of money. On August 31, 2010, Page filed a lawsuit against the musical duo 3OH!3 for infringement of his trademarked &quot;Diamond Cutter&quot; hand gesture.

Page&#x27;s WCW entrance music, &quot;Self High-Five&quot;, intentionally contained similarities to the 1991 Nirvana song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, as composer Jimmy Hart and Page felt it exemplified the &quot;sound of the &#x27;90s&quot;. According to Page, Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl in turn claimed that &quot;WCW owes [Nirvana] money&quot;, but before any further actions or lawsuits took place, the track was altered to &quot;sound like it was it, but wasn&#x27;t&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Page released his autobiography, &quot;Positively Page: The Diamond Dallas Page Journey&quot;, on February 1, 2000.

In 2003, he had his name legally changed to Dallas Page.

On December 1, 1991, Page married Kimberly Page. On July 3, 2004, they announced their amicable separation, before divorcing in 2005.

In 2015, Page married Brenda Nair. They separated in 2019. The divorce was finalized in 2020.

In 2021, Page married Payge McMahon.

Page has two daughters, Brittany Page (born 1987) and Kimberly Page (born 1994), and two stepdaughters, (Alexandra) Lexy Nair (born 1996) and Rachel Nair (born 2001). Lexy currently works with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as a backstage interviewer.

<text>McConnell Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base located four miles (6 km) southeast of the central business district of Wichita, a city in Sedgwick County, Kansas, United States. The airbase was named in honor of the brothers Fred and Thomas McConnell of Wichita, who had both been Air Force pilots and veterans of World War II. It is the home of Air Mobility Command&#x27;s 22nd Air Refueling Wing (22 ARW), Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 931st Air Refueling Wing (931 ARW), and the Kansas Air National Guard&#x27;s 184th Wing (184 W).

McConnell&#x27;s primary mission is to provide global reach by conducting air refueling and airlift where and when needed.

==History==
McConnell Air Force Base was known during the first part of its existence as the Wichita Municipal Airport. Although the field was designed originally to serve only municipal civil airport needs, it had an Air Force connection almost from the beginning.

===Origins===

McConnell&#x27;s history began in October 1924, when the city of Wichita hosted more than 100,000 people for the National Air Congress. The event was used by city planners to raise funds for a proposed Wichita Municipal Airport. The event was a success and ground-breaking ceremonies for the airport were held on 28 June 1929.

In August 1941, the Kansas National Guard 127th Observation Squadron was activated as the first military unit assigned to the Wichita airport. The unit&#x27;s limited equipment included one BC-1A, one C-47, and four L-1 aircraft. This was the start of a cooperative relationship between the people of Wichita and military aviation.

===B-29 Superfortress production===

On 6 October 1941, the unit was ordered to extended active duty and remained an integral part of the United States Army Air Corps until 6 October 1945, with duty assignments in Tennessee and Okinawa. The airport, at that time, was located several miles southeast of downtown Wichita and comprised some 1,337 acres. The runways were adequate; five runways were each wide; two were , one , one , and one in length. All had a wheel load capacity of . A parking apron with dimensions of , and seven taxi strips were provided.

Other facilities at the airport, however, were meager. The field could boast of only one hangar and three small warehouses. No facilities were available either for troop housing or troop messing. No fuel storage facilities existed, and all such supplies were handled by commercial contract.

A lease between the federal government and the city was concluded and on 1 March 1942, the AAF Materiel Center, Midwestern Procurement District (Materiel Command) was established at Wichita Army Airfield. As soon as construction permitted, the headquarters of the district was established in the administration building of the municipal airport. By the end of 1942, due to the growth and expansion of the organization it occupied practically the entire building save for a few offices occupied by the CAA and airline companies, while some activities of the district were housed at the Boeing Airplane Company Plant No. 1, in Wichita.Air Materiel Command&#x27;s mission at the airport was to accept, service and coordinate the transfer of newly produced Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers to other installations. In addition, Ferrying Division, Air Transport Command&#x27;s 4156th AAF Base Unit (Air Base) was organized. The new base unit had the mission of servicing, dispatching, and maintaining transient and locally based aircraft. The working personnel were entirely civilian, with a few officers in supervisory capacities.

On 11 October 1946, the 4156th AAF Base Unit was ordered to cease operations by the 30th of the month. Consequently, the remainder of October was spent in closing down operations and transferring property to Tinker Army Airfield, Oklahoma.

On 15 November the field was officially transferred to the District Engineer, Seventh Service Command at Omaha, Nebraska who assumed jurisdiction over the field, pending disposition, while the 4156th AAF Base Unit was discontinued on the same day. All military personnel were absorbed by Headquarters, Oklahoma City Air Materiel Area (the successor of the Oklahoma City Air Technical Service Command).

Wichita Airport was returned to civilian jurisdiction, and it remained so until 1951.

===Cold War===
The Boeing B-47 Stratojet was the first swept-winged jet bomber built in quantity for any air force, and was the mainstay of the medium-bombing strength of the Strategic Air Command all throughout the 1950s. The Boeing plant at Wichita was shut down after World War II. However, on 3 September 1948, the first production order was placed for the B-47. Since Boeing&#x27;s Seattle facility was already heavily committed to the 
KC-97 Stratofreighter tanker and the B-50 Superfortress bomber, as well as to the conversion of obsolescent B-29 bombers to aerial tankers, it was decided that the production Stratojets were to be built at Boeing&#x27;s factory in Wichita.

==== B-47 Stratojet training ====
By the summer of 1950, Boeing was ready to turn out the first production models of the B-47, and the United States Air Force sought to make Wichita Airport a permanent military installation. Public hearings began to consider locating an Air Force base near the Wichita Boeing facilities, and the city of Wichita was awarded $9.4 million to build a new airfield for its own use, later to become known as Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. In addition, the production of the B-47 Stratojet bomber at Boeing made the airport a desirable location for the Air Force to conduct B-47 combat crew training.

On 31 May 1951, the USAF took title to Wichita Municipal Airport, and on 4 June the Air Training Command 3520th Combat Crew Training Wing was activated at the facility. To perform the training, the 3520th Combat Crew Training Wing was activated, and an ambitious building program totaling some $22,000,000 was begun.

In spite of the difficulty of building an installation and initiating an entirely new program simultaneously, the base developed into a highly specialized training center. There were two principal parts to the mission of the training center: aircrew training in B-47&#x27;s and transition training in the same aircraft. A subsequent fluctuation of emphasis from one of those functions to the other reflected the varying demands of the Strategic Air Command. A more inclusive functional title was given the wing in June 1952 when it was redesignated the 3520th Flying Training Wing (M Bomb).

The Air Force was not the sole occupant during this period. In 1952 Wing Headquarters shared the Wichita Municipal Airport Terminal Building with four commercial airlines, Braniff Airlines, Central Airlines, Trans World Airlines, and Continental Airlines, and also one private flying service: &quot;Executive Airways&quot;. These air lines were located in the terminal building at the time of government occupation, and they were permitted to operate on a temporary basis pending completion of the new municipal airport for Wichita.

Up through 1 April 1952, the Wichita Municipal Airport was under the jurisdiction of the Flying Training Air Force. On that date it was transferred to the Crew Training Air Force, another division of the Air Training Command.

By 1952, the Air Force had decided to make a permanent airbase of the municipal airport. The Federal Government took over the property by federal court action during the first half of 1952, thus becoming the owner and no longer a lessee. Reflecting official government ownership, Wichita Municipal Airport was redesignated as the Wichita Air Force Base on 15 May 1953.

However, the name was changed to McConnell Air Force Base after less than a year in honor of Wichita brothers Fred and Thomas McConnell, both Air Force pilots and World War II veterans. Fred was killed in a private plane crash in 1945, while Thomas died in a bombing raid on Bougainville Island in the South Pacific.

Air Training Command was host at the base from 1951 through 1958, training B-47 aircrews. Strategic Air Command took control over the base on 1 July 1958 and the B-47 training mission. The 4347th Combat Crew Training Wing replaced the 3520th and the 42d Strategic Aerospace Division was activated on 15 July 1959. B-47 crew training continued at McConnell until 1 March 1963 when the 4347th CCTW was inactivated.

====Titan II ballistic missiles====
On 1 March 1962, Strategic Air Command stood up the 381st Strategic Missile Wing (SMW). Using McConnell as their base, 18 Titan II ICBM missile silos formed a ring from the northeast around to the south and the west on an irregular radius of 20 to 50 miles from the base. This mission of deterrence dominated base activity for the next twenty-four years until 1986 when the 381st Strategic Missile Wing was inactivated. The removal of the missiles and of all Titan II ICBM systems began in July 1982 and was completed in June 1987. All of the missile silos in Kansas and Arkansas were demolished, and all but one of them in Arizona.

====Tactical fighter aircraft====
In October 1962, the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at McConnell with four (560th, 561st, 562d, 563d) fighter squadrons. The wing initially flew the North American F-100C Super Sabre, but was replaced in 1963 by the Republic F-105D/F Thunderchief. On 4 July 1963, Tactical Air Command became responsible for the base with the 388 TFW as host unit.

On 21 July 1964, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing was also reactivated at McConnell with four F-105 (354th, 357th, 421st, 469th) squadrons. Both wings would deploy to Thailand in support of the Vietnam War. On 8 November 1965, the 355th was ordered to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base and on 8 April 1966 the 388th TFW was ordered to Korat RTAFB, where its F-105 squadrons had been on a rotational deployment for the past two years.

On 8 February 1964 the 23d Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at McConnell initially with three F-105 (561st, 562d, 563d) squadrons. The 4519th Combat Crew Training Squadron was activated on 1 August 1967 with F-105B/D/F/G aircraft, then was inactivated on 16 October 1969, being replaced by the 419th TFS.

Squadron markings on the natural metal / silver lacquered aircraft included the following: 561 TFS – black/yellow checkerboarding on rudder; 562 TFS – a red, white and black &quot;sharkmouth&quot; on the nose of the aircraft; 563 TFS red and white stripes on the rudder, wingtips and stabilizers with a white band on the top of the vertical fin. When the finish on tactical jets was replaced by Southeast Asian Camouflaged, the squadrons carried the following tail codes: 561 TFS &quot;MD&quot;; 562 TFS &quot;ME&quot;; 563 TFS &quot;MF&quot;, and the 4519th, (later 419th TFS).TFTS &quot;MG&quot;.

The mission of the 23 TFW at McConnell was to provide training for F-105 pilots prior to their deployment to Southeast Asia. The 560th acted as a combat training squadron, while the other three squadrons began rotational TDY deployments to Southeast Asia beginning in November 1964.

In February 1965, when the 23 TFW deployed three squadrons to Southeast Asia for combat, these units were initially under the control of the 2d Air Division. Later, the 6441 TFW (P) was activated at Takhli RTAFB in July 1965, taking control of the 23d&#x27;s squadrons deployed there. In addition to the deployments to Thailand, detachments of the 561 TFS also deployed to Da Nang Air Base RVN for operations within the borders of the Republic of Vietnam.

On 1 August 1967, the 4519th Combat Crew Training squadron was added to the 23 TFW, and the 560 TFS was inactivated on 25 September 1968.

The wing maintained proficiency in tactical fighter operations, and later also functioned as an F-105 replacement training unit and assisted Air National Guard units in their conversion to the F-105 when the Thunderchief left first-line service. For the dual role it played from June 1970 to June 1971 as both an operational and a training unit, the wing received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. In 1970, the &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; F-105G model replaced the F-105D/F models in the 561st and 419th TFSs.

On 1 July 1972, the 23d TFW was transferred to England AFB, Louisiana where it replaced the temporary 4403d TFW, and the 561, 562 and 563 TFS were assigned to the 35 TFW at George AFB, California.

The administrative organization in command of these wings was the 835th Air Division, activated on 24 June 1964. This AD was inactivated 30 June 1971, leaving the 23d TFW as the main air unit at McConnell until its departure a year later.

====Strategic bomber/air refueling====
McConnell received a new mission in April 1971 with the arrival of the 91st Air Refueling Squadron (ARS) and their Boeing KC-135A Stratotankers from Robins AFB, Georgia. Control of the base was transferred back to SAC on 1 July 1972, and the 384th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) began its tour at McConnell AFB in December 1972 and took control of the 91st ARS. On 30 September 1973, a second KC-135A refueling squadron, the 384th ARS was activated on the base, making McConnell an air refueling hub for SAC.

In early 1983, the 384 ARW&#x27;s leadership learned that it would be the first wing to receive the upgraded KC-135R. The 91st and 384th ARW were both upgraded to the new model in 1984. The &quot;R&quot; model had upgraded engines which produced much greater fuel efficiency than the older models, as well as having a higher on-board fuel storage capacity. The initial aircraft marking for both squadrons was a light blue/navy blue diamond checkerboard fin flash.

On 2 October 1981, President Ronald Reagan announced a Strategic Modernization Program (SMP), a key feature of which would be the procurement of 100 North American-Rockwell B-1B bombers. The first production models entered the USAF inventory in March 1985. It was announced by the Air Force that McConnell would be equipped with the B-1B in 1987. The 384th was redesignated as the 384th Bombardment Wing, Heavy on 1 July 1987, and the 28th Bombardment Squadron was activated that date to fly the 25 bombers assigned to the wing.

With the arrival of the B-1s, the 91st ARS was inactivated, leaving the wing with one KC-135 tanker squadron. The 91st was later reactivated in July 1988 with the new 301st ARW at Malmstrom AFB, Montana with KC-135R aircraft.

In January 1987, the Kansas Air National Guard 184th Tactical Fighter Training Group upgraded from its McDonnell-Douglas F-4D fighters to the General Dynamics F-16A/B Fighting Falcon and conducted conversion and upgrade training in the F-16. On 8 July 1987, the 161st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was established as the third flying squadron at McConnell. Formal activation ceremonies for the 161st occurred on 12 September 1987, with the unit flying 10 F-16s and conducting its first student training class.

In August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait and McConnell personnel and aircraft were deployed throughout the Middle East, performing refueling missions of Coalition aircraft in support of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm to help eject the invaders from the small kingdom of Kuwait.

===1991 tornado===

On 26 April 1991, an F5 tornado devastated McConnell during the Andover, Kansas Tornado Outbreak. As a result of the tornado, the base constructed new facilities to replace the destroyed base services. Moving in a northeast direction, the tornado crossed the southern end of the runways, missing a line of B-1B bombers, two of which were carrying nuclear ordnance, and maintenance hangars. One of the new facilities included a combined Officers Club/Enlisted Club/Fitness Center which was coincidentally christened &quot;Emerald City&quot;, after the destination of Dorothy after her house was deposited in Oz by a tornado in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, before being renamed the &quot;Robert J. Dole Community Center&quot; on 29 October 2004.

===Post Cold War===
With the end of the Cold War, the Air Force went through many changes. One of these changes was the Objective Wing concept, which created &quot;Operations Groups&quot; (OG) to place operational aircraft squadrons under organizationally. The 38th engaged this change on 1 September 1991 and was redesignated simply as the 384th Wing, with the 28th Bomb Squadron (B-1B) and the 384th Air Refueling Squadron (KC-135R) as its operational units.

In 1992, additional changes were made at McConnell. In March, the 184th Tactical Fighter Group was designated as the 184th Fighter Group. On 1 June Strategic Air Command was inactivated as part of a massive re-alignment of the Air Force command structure. The 384th was assigned to the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC), a new command which replaced SAC, TAC and elements of Military Airlift Command (MAC). The wing was again redesignated as the 384th Bomb Wing, and the 28th BS aircraft were assigned the tail code &quot;OZ&quot;. The 384th ARS was relieved from assignment to McConnell, and was reassigned to the 19th OG (19th Air Refueling Wing) at Robins AFB, Georgia. The 184th FG also became part of ACC.

In July 1993, the 184th Fighter Group changed gaining commands and became part of the new Air Education and Training Command, due to its F-16 training commitment, however just one year later the 184th rejoined ACC when the F-16s were transferred out. The unit was redesignated as the 184th Bomb Wing and the redesignated 127th Bomb Squadron received the first of fourteen B-1B bombers. The unit became operational in the summer of 1994. The 184th was the first Air National Guard unit to fly the B-1 Lancer.

As a result of a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) related realignment, March AFB, California was taken off active duty status and assigned to the Air Force Reserve. As part of a program to keep historically significant wings active, its 22d Air Refueling Wing was reassigned to McConnell without personnel or equipment on 1 January 1994. As a result, on 1 January, the 384th was redesignated as the 384th Bomb Group, as a unit under the 22d ARW.

The USAF planned to return McConnell to being an air refueling hub, and as a result the B-1 equipped 28th Bomb Squadron was reassigned without equipment or personnel to the 7th OG at Dyess AFB, Texas on 1 October 1994. Its B-1 aircraft were transferred across the runway to the Kansas Air National Guard 127th Bomb Squadron and the 384th BG was inactivated on 30 September 1994. Throughout 1994, various KC-135R air refueling squadrons were reassigned from other units to the 22d ARW as follows:
* 344 ARS from 68th ARW, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC (29 April 1994)
* 349 ARS was reactivated at McConnell (1 January 1994)
* 350 ARS from 43d ARW, Beale AFB, CA (1 July 1994)
* 384 ARS from the 19th ARW, Robins AFB, GA (1 January 1994)

On 1 April 1994, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) selected McConnell as its training base for its KC-135 crews and maintenance personnel. The RSAF stationed two of their Stratotankers with the 22 ARW, naming the organization the Peace Guardian Detachment

On 1 January 1995, the Air Force Reserve 931st Air Refueling Group (ARG) joined Team McConnell. The Air Force Reserve associate unit provides aircrews while the 22d furnishes the maintenance crews and aircraft.

Since 1996, McConnell served as the test site for the PACER CRAG avionics modernization program. The next year, the base became the test unit for the multi-point refueling.

During the 1990s, the 22d ARW deployed crews and aircraft to support no-fly missions over northern and southern Iraq and over Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1999, wing aircraft and crews deployed to the Mediterranean to refuel NATO aircraft over Serbia.

====Global war on terror====
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the 22d initially deployed jets in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Before the end of the year, McConnell tankers were sent to Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Southwest Asia and other locations to support Operation Enduring Freedom.

In 2002, in order to save money, the USAF agreed to reduce its active fleet of B-1Bs from 92 to 60 aircraft. All B-1 aircraft built in FY 1983 and most of the FY 1984 B-1 aircraft, which primarily resided in the Kansas Air National Guard and the Georgia Air National Guard, were retired beginning in August 2002, leaving only the more recently built B-1 aircraft in the Regular Air Force still flying. As a result, the 184th Bomb Wing&#x27;s aircraft were transferred to 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG). Initially they were retained in &quot;active storage&quot; which means that they could be quickly returned to service should circumstances dictate. In fact, the older aircraft were scavenged for parts to keep the active-duty aircraft flying.

With the retirement of their B-1s, in September 2002, the 184th took on a new mission flying KC-135s and was officially designated the 184th Air Refueling Wing. This officially established McConnell as the sole base in the U.S. Air Force where all three components, Active Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve supported the same mission together in a pure &quot;Mirror Force&quot; concept.

The Base Realignment and Closure Committee in 2005 said that the 184th Air Refueling Wing would become the 184th Intelligence Wing, a non-flying organization, and their KC-135R aircraft transferred to other Regular Air Force air refueling and air mobility wings. They converted to that designation in 2007.

On 23 April 2014, the USAF announced that the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus will be based at McConnell Air Force Base. The base will start receiving the first of 36 tankers in 2016. The Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker is currently stationed at this base. McConnell AFB was chosen because it had low construction costs and it is in a location with a high demand for air refueling. Up to 10 operating bases are to be chosen for the KC-46 fleet. Pegasus crews will be trained at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Altus AFB was also chosen for its limited construction needs and for other training programs for the C-17 Globemaster and KC-135 already at the base.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 28 March 1956, a B-47 exploded near Wichita, Kansas, with an instructor and two student pilots on board. It crashed four miles northeast of the city, killing its crew of three. The office of information services at McConnell Air Force Base said the explosion occurred after takeoff, probably at about 2,000 feet altitude. Wreckage was strewn along the countryside for several miles as the wings sheared off and the fuselage tumbled to earth.
*On 16 January 1965, USAF KC-135A 57-1442, crashed after an engine failure shortly after takeoff from McConnell Air Force Base in north Wichita, Kansas. The fuel-laden plane crashed at a residential street intersection and caused a considerable fire. A total of 30 were killed, including 23 on the ground and the seven member crew.
*13 January 1992, an F-16 84-1267 of the 184th TFG out of McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas Air National Guard was returning from a practice firing sortie of a M61A1 20mm cannon. Major David Ternes of the 127th Fighter Squadron was bringing the aircraft into McConnell AFB when he experienced trouble at 11:06 hours. Ternes was forced to eject at 150 feet and two miles from base and the aircraft hit the side of a house and exploded. Both the pilot and the home&#x27;s occupant survived uninjured. The cause was determined to be a lack of engine response.
*On 20 November 2013 at approximately 9:30 pm CST, a Boeing 747-400 Dreamlifter with registration N780BA and operated by Atlas Air, mistakenly landed at the Colonel James Jabara Airport. The large cargo plane was supposed to land at McConnell Air Force Base, taxi over to nearby Spirit AeroSystems, and pick up some fuselage parts for the assembly of Boeing 787 Dreamliners in Seattle, Washington. The plane successfully took off from Jabara Airport at 1:15 pm CST on 21 November and landed shortly thereafter at McConnell AFB. The NTSB opened an investigation about the wrong landing.

<text>Louis Marie Jacques Amalric, comte de Narbonne-Lara (August 1755 – 17 November 1813) was a French nobleman, soldier and diplomat.

Born at Colorno in the Duchy of Parma, Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara, was possibly the illegitimate son of King Louis XV of France. Raised at Versailles and educated with a focus on classical studies and military training, he became colonel of the Army at 25. He married Marie Adélaïde de Montholon, with whom he had two daughters, and also had two illegitimate children.

Narbonne-Lara held various military and diplomatic roles throughout his life. During the French Revolution, he served as Minister of War under Louis XVI but resigned due to disagreements with the Feuillants. He later joined the Army of the North and was promoted to lieutenant general. After the fall of the monarchy, he fled France and returned in 1801.

Napoleon called him into service in 1809, and he held several prominent positions, including Governor of Raab, divisional general commander in Trieste, and minister plenipotentiary in Bavaria. He advised Napoleon against invading Russia but was not heeded. Following the Russian Campaign, he served as the French ambassador in Vienna and Governor of Torgau. He died of typhus in 1813, and his name was inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe.

==Birth and early life==
He was born at Colorno, in the Duchy of Parma. His mother was Françoise de Chalus (bap. Château de Châlus-Chabrol, Châlus, Haute-Vienne, 24 February 1734 – Paris, 7 July 1821, daughter of Gabriel de Châlus, seigneur de Sansac, and Claire Gérault de Solages), one of the ladies-in-waiting of Elizabeth, Duchess of Parma and Chamberlain-Major of Princess Marie Adélaïde of France.&lt;br&gt; 

Her husband was a nobleman of Spanish descent, Don Jean François, 1er duc de Narbonne-Lara. He was a Grandee of Spain 1st Class, Lieutenant General of the Army, Commander in Name of the King of the Dioceses of Castres, Albi and Lavaur, 1st Gentleman of the House of H.R.H. the Duke of Parma (Aubiac, Lot-et-Garonne, 27 December 1718 – 12 August 1806). The father was son of François de Narbonne-Lara, seigneur d&#x27; Aubiac, and his second wife Olympie Angélique de Goth. 

His parents married on 10 July 1749. They had an older son Philippe, the 2e duc de Narbonne-Lara, who died without issue.&lt;br&gt; 

However, it is alleged that Louis XV himself was the real father. The coevals attribute the count&#x27;s paternity to the King of France Louis XV. According to documents of the Military Archive, the comte Jean François de Narbonne-Lara had been wounded eight years earlier in the War of the Austrian Succession (1747), becoming from that moment on unable of having any offspring. The baptism of Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara is another indication of that paternity. His wife became thus the King&#x27;s mistress. Not only was the comte&#x27;s name also Louis, but his contemporaries always remarked about the similarities between Louis and the King.

He was brought up at Versailles with the Princesses of France. His education was princely, inclined mostly towards the Classical studies and a rigid military formation; he frequented the main Courts of Europe, where he was able to familiarize with the foreign languages (German and English), which also contributed to his diplomatic formation.

He was made Colonel of the Army at the age of twenty-five.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Marie Adélaïde (sometimes Adélaïde Marie) de Montholon (Mâcon, 11 or 16 October 1767 – 1848), Lady of &quot;Madame&quot; Victoire of France, daughter of Louis XV, on 16 April 1782 at Paris, France, with whom he had two daughters. She was the daughter of Nicolas de Montholon (son of Pierre de Montholon and Marguerite Baron, married on 11 June 1711) and Marguerite Fournier de la Chapelle (daughter of Charles Fournier de la Chapelle and Marie Louise Dureau). Their daughters were:
* Louise Amable Rion Françoise de Narbonne-Lara (Nice, 25 May 1786 – Lisbon, 28 March 1849), Dame of Honour of Her Majesty Queen Mary II of Portugal (with right to the Grandeeship of Spain for being representative of her paternal uncle the 2e duc de Narbonne-Lara), who married at Agen on 17 February 1806 the Portuguese of Dutch descent Hermano José Braamcamp de Almeida Castelo-Branco, 5th Lord, 2nd Baron, 1st Viscount and 1st Count of Sobral (16 September 1775 – Lisbon, 2 February 1846), and had two daughters
* Marie Adélaïde Charlotte de Narbonne-Lara (Belleville, 11 May 1790 – Champgrenon, 31 May 1856), who married at Agen on 7 March 1808 Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau (Mâcon, 9 November 1781 – Château de Rambuteau, 11 April 1869), and had two daughters

Out of wedlock he had by Jeanne Pitrot-Verteil one son:
* Louis Jean Amalric de Narbonne-Lara, born in Paris, unmarried and without issue

And by Louise-Françoise Contat (16 June 1760 – 9 March 1813), actress with the Comédie-Française, one daughter:
* Louise Amalrique Bathilde Isidore Contat de Narbonne-Lara (Saint Pierre de Chaillot, Paris, 21 September 1788 – ?), who married in Paris on 2 December 1811 Jan Frederik Abbema (born in Amsterdam on 13 June 1773) and had one son:
** Émile-Léon, vicomte Abbéma, who had an only daughter by his wife Henriette Anne d&#x27; Astoin:
*** Louise Abbéma (Étampes, 30 October 1853 – Paris, 4 August 1927), unmarried and without issue

==Early career==
He is found in 1785 as a colonel of the Army and honorary chamberlain of Princess &quot;Madame&quot; Marie Adélaïde of France. In 1786 he was the commander of an infantry regiment, and remained in that post until the evenings of the French Revolution.

==French Revolution==
His liberal ideas soon made him be one of the first inscribed in the Club de Valois, where the Duke of Orléans presided. He was afterwards appointed commander of the National Guard in Franche-Comté. His friendship with Talleyrand brought him an appointment to command a special guard, composed of the most disciplined soldiers of the National Guard of Paris.

The comte de Narbonne-Lara always maintained his fidelity towards the King; a true idealist, he hoped for a Constitutional Monarchy.

He became maréchal de camp in 1791, and, through the influence of Madame de Staël, was appointed Minister of War of Louis XVI. In this office he tried at all cost to impose his constitutional project, helped by the Bishop of Autun, Baumetz and Chapelier. But he showed incapacity in this post, and gave in his resignation. Despite his efforts, he did not carry his point, for in March 1792 the King, moved by intrigues and by the intransigence of those who surrounded him, thought right to dismiss him from that Ministry. His resignation was the result of his disagreements with the Feuillants on the question of foreign war. Narbonne-Lara and his friends hoped to bring on the war with Austria, by which they hoped to restore the prestige of the monarchy. Narbonne-Lara made an alliance with the Marquis de Lafayette, but their schemes were defeated. After his resignation, he joined the Army of the North and, in May 1792, he was elevated to Lieutenant General of the Army. After less than six months from his dismissal, the French Monarchy was agonizing, the French Republic was proclaimed and the Royal Family was incarcerated. Later, Narbonne actually incurred suspicion as a Feuillant. The comte de Narbonne-Lara also had on him a prison warrant. Due to this, and also to questions about his policy at the war office, he managed to seek refuge at the Embassy of Sweden, emigrated after 10 August 1792, and later evaded to London and from there to Germany, having visited England, Switzerland and Germany. During the Consulate, his friends Talleyrand and Fouché managed to remove his name from the list of the wanted, and returned to France in 1801, where he was retired with the patent of Divisional General.

==In Napoleon&#x27;s service==
In 1809 Napoleon remembered him and called him into his service. Brilliant, cultivated and perfectly aware of the uses of the Ancien Régime, &quot;persona grata&quot; with the main Courts of Europe, skilled diplomat and military, he was the ideal person to be at Napoleon&#x27;s side. As such, he was reintegrated and re-entered the Army with his former post of lieutenant general and appointed Governor of Raab, with the command of the whole part of Hungary occupied by the imperial troops. After the signed peace with Hungary, he was appointed Divisional General Commander of the 4th Military Division in Trieste. In that same year of 1809 he was sent to Vienna to arrange the marriage of the Emperor with Archduchess Marie Louise. In 1810 he was subsequently appointed Minister Plenipotentiary in Bavaria at Munich, next to King Maximilian I, whom he knew very well before the Revolution, and in 1811 &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Napoleon. He was created an Officer of the Legion of Honour and Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Hubert.

In 1812 he went on diplomatic mission to Prussia; this mission had the purpose of ascertaining King Frederick William III towards his attitude in case France went to war with Russia. In returning to Paris, de Narbonne-Lara advised Napoleon not to invade Russia, but his advice was not followed; and so he reassumed his place in the Imperial Army on the Russian border. When he arrived there, he was sent by Napoleon to the city of Wilna, where the Tsar was; the comte de Narbonne-Lara was the bearer of an ultimatum, to which Alexander I categorically refused.

The tragic outcome of the Russian Campaign did not minimize the action of the Officers of the Imperial Army. Among them, he was outstanding for his military uprightness and exemplary behaviour; in the whirl of the retreat, he appeared dauntless and serene, his presence imposed confidence and respect to the demoralized troops. Mounted on his horse beside the carriage of the defeated Napoleon, he was the personification of the dignity and honour of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;.

In 1813 he was appointed and sent as French Ambassador at Vienna, where he was engaged in an unequal diplomatic duel with Metternich during the fateful months that witnessed the defection of Austria from the cause of Napoleon to that of the Allies, to confirm the alliance between France and Austria, objective he was not able to fulfill; the Empire had its days cut short. In that same year he was appointed governor of the stronghold of Torgau (Saxony), one of the main strategic points for the defense of the Empire. On 17 November 1813, after reviewing the troops on horse, he died of typhus. His aide-de-camp, Captain comte de Rohan-Chabot, brought his heart back to France, and afterwards the name of the comte de Narbonne-Lara was inscribed on the east side of the Arc de Triomphe.

<text>In aeronautics, downwash is the change in direction of air deflected by the aerodynamic action of an airfoil, wing, or helicopter rotor blade in motion, as part of the process of producing lift. In helicopter aerodynamics discussions, it may be referred to as induced flow.

Lift on an airfoil is an example of the application of Newton&#x27;s third law of motion – the force required to deflect the air in the downwards direction is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the lift force on the airfoil. Lift on an airfoil is also an example of the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. The Kutta condition explains the existence of downwash at the trailing edge of the wing.
