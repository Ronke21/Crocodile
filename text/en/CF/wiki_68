<text>Kevin Patrick Brady (born April 11, 1955) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes northern Houston, including The Woodlands. He retired after the 2022 election cycle.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Brady was born in Vermillion, South Dakota, one of five children of William F. and Nancy A. Brady. His father, a lawyer, was killed in 1967 in a courtroom shooting in Rapid City when Brady was 12 and his mother was in her early 30s. He graduated from Central High School in 1973. Brady has a degree in mass communications from the University of South Dakota in Vermillion.

Brady worked for the Rapid City area Chamber of Commerce. He was elected to the Rapid City common council at age 26. In 1982, he moved to Texas to work for the Beaumont, Texas Chamber of Commerce. In 1985, he went to work for the South Montgomery County Woodlands Chamber of Commerce.

==Texas House of Representatives==
In 1990, Brady was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, district 15, representing The Woodlands, parts of Montgomery County, and five other counties west and north of Houston. He succeeded Mike McKinney as a representative of the 15th district in the Texas House of representatives on January 10, 1991.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

==== 1996 ====
Incumbent U.S. Representative Jack Fields of Texas&#x27;s 8th congressional district decided to retire. Brady ran for the seat and ranked second in the Republican primary with 22% of the vote in a six-candidate field. The candidate who ranked first, Gene Fontenot, received 36% of the vote, short of the 50% threshold. In the runoff election, Brady defeated him, 53%–47%. But the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;Bush v. Vera&quot; that three of Texas&#x27;s congressional districts were unconstitutional. After hearings, the court concluded that there was no longer time to hold primaries and instead forced all candidates (Democrats and Republicans) be listed together on the November general election ballot in a jungle primary. If no candidate reached 50%, a special runoff would be held on December 10 between the two highest-ranking candidates. In the November election, Brady ranked first with 41% of the vote. In the December runoff, he defeated Fontenot again, 59%–41%.

==== 1998–2008 ====
During this period, Brady never received less than 67% of the vote.

==== 2010 ====

For the first time since 1998, Brady was challenged in the Republican primary. Three candidates filed against him. He defeated all of them in the March primary with 79% of the vote. He was reelected with 80% of the vote.

==== 2012 ====

In the May Republican primary, in a newly redrawn district, he defeated his challenger with 76% of the vote. In the November 6 general election, he defeated the Democratic nominee with over 77% of the vote.

==== 2014 ====
Brady won the March 4 Republican primary with 41,549 votes (68%) to Craig McMichael&#x27;s 19,508 (32%).

In the November 4 general election, Brady was reelected with 124,897 votes (89.32%) to Democratic nominee Ken Petty&#x27;s 14,930 (10.67%).

==== 2016 ====
In November 2015, Steve Toth, a former state representative from The Woodlands, Texas, announced that he would run against Brady.

Brady eked out a victory in the March 1 primary with 53% of the vote, his lowest total in his 18-year career. He spent over $1.5 million to Toth&#x27;s $89,325. Toth criticized Brady for compromising too often with President Obama, for supporting the omnibus federal budget bill, and for voting to revive the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

==== 2018 ====

Brady won the Republican primary unopposed, as did the Democratic nominee, Steven David. Brady won the general election with 198,241 votes (73.5%) to David&#x27;s 67,027 (24.8%). Libertarian Chris Duncan received 4,597 votes. As of September 30, 2018, Brady had outraised David in contributions, $4,899,672 to $31,664.

==== 2020 ====

Brady defeated Kirk Osborn in the Republican primary, 80.73% to 16.19%. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Elizabeth Hernandez and Libertarian challenger Chris Duncan with 72.5% of the vote to the challengers&#x27; 27.5%. The 2020 election was Brady&#x27;s last election for Congress.

===Tenure===
In 2002, Brady voted for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq, authorizing the U.S. invasion of Iraq the next year. Yet in 2008 he was one of the 24 Republicans (and 227 Democrats) to vote to impeach President George W. Bush for misleading the United States into going to war in Iraq.In 2005, Brady was a chief supporter of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), working with the Bush administration to secure passage of that free-trade agreement. In 2011, Brady also voted for free-trade agreements with South Korea Colombia, and Panama. But in 2017, Brady supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposed border adjustment tax, arguing that the tax on imports would place the U.S. on a level playing field with other countries that have the tax and raise an estimated $1 trillion.

Brady is known as the author of a federal &quot;sunset law&quot; that would require every federal program not specifically written into the Constitution to justify its existence to taxpayers within 12 years or face elimination.

In March 2012, Brady proposed the Sound Dollar Act, legislation to require the Federal Reserve to monitor gold and the foreign-exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The bill would also repeal the Federal Reserve&#x27;s dual mandate (controlling unemployment and inflation) and replace it with a single mandate for U.S. dollar price stability.

In November 2015, Brady was elected the 65th chair of the Committee on Ways and Means, serving until 2019.

In March 2017, Brady introduced an amendment to the American Health Care Act (the House Republican proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act) that would allow health insurance providers to fully deduct all forms of compensation to their most highly compensated executives without limit, repealing the current law, which capped the deduction at $500,000 per executive. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Michael Hiltzik criticized Brady&#x27;s amendment as a &quot;secret payoff&quot; to the health insurance industry because of its cryptic language.

As chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means, Brady opposed a resolution to request ten years&#x27; worth of returns from Trump and his business entities. In 2017, he said the resolution was an abuse done for &quot;obvious political purposes&quot;. In September 2020, after &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an extensive report on Trump&#x27;s tax records and business dealings spanning two decades, Brady called for an investigation into the &quot;Times&quot; and the report&#x27;s sources.

In November 2017, Brady said that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would provide &quot;tax relief at every level&quot;; in fact, 7% of households in 2018 would pay more in taxes and by 2022, one quarter of households would pay more. Brady&#x27;s claim that 70% of the tax cuts in the bill would go to households making below $200,000 was found to be &quot;misleading&quot; by FactCheck.Org and &quot;cherry-picked&quot; by PolitiFact. FactCheck.org noted that &quot;57.7 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than $200,000 in 2019—not the 70 percent that Brady cited for 2019. By 2027, 50 percent of tax relief as a result of business and individual income tax changes would go to those making more than $200,000 a year.&quot; The American Conservative Union gave him a 94% evaluation in 2017.

Brady and Representative Richard Neal introduced the bipartisan SECURE Act of 2019, which contained a number of provisions to expand access to retirement planning options and to encourage employers to set up retirement plans for workers. The bill, originally introduced in March 2019, was passed into law in December 2019 as part of the fiscal year 2020 federal appropriations bill.

In December 2020, Brady was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of &quot;election subversion.&quot;

In December 2020, Brady indicated that he supported a second round of Paycheck Protection Program funds to assist small businesses suffering from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. He was a negotiator during the discussions to pass the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.

In January 2021, after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, Brady argued that those calling for Trump&#x27;s impeachment or for the invocation of the 25th Amendment were themselves engaging in inflammatory language and that such calls could incite further violence.

On April 14, 2021, Brady announced that he would not run for a 14th House term and would retire in 2022.

==Political positions==

===Taxation===
Brady believes policies enacted by the first Trump administration, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, helped put the U.S. economy in a robust position going into the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Medicare===
Brady strongly opposes Medicare for All.

===Energy===
In 2012, Brady voted for the Coal Miner Employment and Domestic Energy Infrastructure Protection Act, which rescinded Obama administration policies on coal mining and energy infrastructure. In January 2021, he expressed concern that the Biden administration&#x27;s drilling ban Executive Order 13990 on federal leases would &quot;kill&quot; 120,000 Texas jobs.

===LGBT rights===
In 2011, Brady cosponsored legislation directing the Justice Department to continue defending the Defense of Marriage Act. He opposed &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional, citing his beliefs that marriage is &quot;a union between one man and one woman&quot; and that same-sex marriage law should be delegated to the states under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 2019, Brady voted against expressing opposition to banning service in the armed forces by openly transgender individuals, and in 2021, he voted against the Equality Act. The Human Rights Campaign gave Brady a score of 0 out of 100 for his voting record on legislation in the 116th Congress.

==Personal life==
Brady lives in The Woodlands, a suburb of Houston, with his wife, Cathy, and two sons.

In October 2005, Brady was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol in South Dakota. He pleaded no contest, was convicted of a misdemeanor, and fined $350. Brady issued an apology.

<doc id="962116" wikidata="Q5283889" url="?curid=962116" title="Uniformed services diver insignia (United States)">
<text>The various diver insignia (also known as &quot;diver badges&quot;, &quot;dive badges,&quot; and colloquially known as &quot;dive bubbles&quot;) of the uniformed services of the United States are badges awarded to service personnel once they have graduated an appropriate diving course. The badges&#x27; origins lie in the cloth patch decoration worn by United States Navy divers on the upper-portion of the enlisted service uniform&#x27;s left sleeve during the first part of World War II, when the rating insignia was worn on the right sleeve. When enlisted rating insignia were shifted to the left sleeve in late World War II, the patch shifted to the upper right sleeve. The Navy transitioned to a metal breast insignia (with cloth breast insignia for utility and battle uniforms) in the late 1960s, with the other services following suit over the following decades.

Currently, the United States Army, United States Navy, and United States Air Force all issue diver insignia and badges denoting varying degrees of qualification and also generally permit the wearing of each others&#x27; diver insignia. The United States Marine Corps issues its own diver insignia in a single degree and Marine Corps personnel are eligible to earn and wear most of the Navy&#x27;s dive badges (Navy personnel are also eligible to earn and wear the Marine Corps&#x27; unique dive insignia). The United States Coast Guard also issues a single unique diver insignia (in a single degree) but its personnel are also eligible to earn and wear most Navy dive badges. The United States Space Force does not issue a unique diver insignia and most of its personnel are not afforded the opportunity to earn such badges from sister services (except via prior service), although the insignia are authorized for wear on Space Force uniforms. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps is the only non-armed service of the uniformed services to issue a unique diver insignia; the Commissioned Officer Corps also authorizes all earned armed services badges (to include all diver insignia) to be worn on NOAA uniforms. 

==United States naval services==
United States naval diver insignias are awarded, per degree of qualification, to sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen. The elementary naval diver insignia is the Scuba Diver Insignia, awarded upon qualifying as a basic naval diver. Previously, the Scuba Diver Insignia was awarded in two degrees, one for officers and one for enlisted. The Navy eliminated the Scuba Diver Officer insignia in the 1990s, but it remains in service within the Coast Guard. The silver-colored insignia features an old-fashioned diving mask and open-circuit breathing apparatus.

In 2001, the Marine Corps authorized the creation of a new badge, the Combatant Diver Insignia, attesting to the wearer&#x27;s closed-circuit rebreather and reconnaissance combat diver training; the gold-colored combatant diver insignia depicts a wetsuit hood, low-profile diving mask, and chest-mounted rebreather.

The naval deep sea diver qualification insignia are awarded in four degrees: second-class diver; first-class diver; master diver; and diving officer. However, the Marine Corps does not award the Diving Officer Insignia to its officers. In the Navy, the master diver is the most qualified diver; he must be a chief petty officer before applying to attend the master diver course.

The Diving Medical Officer Insignia and the Diving Medical Technician Insignia are awarded to naval medical personnel qualified as divers or medical technicians, respectively. The Diving Medical Insignia resembles the Master Diver Insignia, but is decorated with a caduceus. The Diving Medical Officer Insignia is gold in color while the enlisted version—the Diving Medical Technician Insignia—is silver in color. Since the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard have no organic medical officers, they do not issue the Diving Medical Officer Insignia. However, like all medicine, the Marine Corps is served by US Navy Diving Medical Officers and Diving Medical Technicians. The Diving Medical Officers attend their own training course that often has Air Force, Army, and foreign doctors all who, upon completion, wear the Navy Diving Medical Officer insignia. The enlisted Diving Medical Technicians attend the same course as Navy divers training to become second-class divers, but with slight changes to the curriculum for medicine. They enter that class having already trained as Navy hospital corpsmen.

Like the Navy&#x27;s surface, submarine, and aviation enlisted specialties, dive-qualified enlisted personnel place a term after the sailor&#x27;s rating; for example, if Petty Officer Second-Class Jones is dive-qualified, he is referred to, in writing, as PO2 (DV) Jones.

The only non-armed service of the United States that awards diver badges is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps (NOAA Corps). NOAA Corps officers qualified as NOAA divers may wear the NOAA Diver Insignia after authorization by the Director of the NOAA Corps. The NOAA Diver Insignia is a gold-colored pin consisting of a NOAA Corps device surrounded by two dolphins.

==United States Army==

The United States Army issues two different types of diver badges, one for Army engineer divers and one for Army special operations divers. Army engineer diver badges are awarded in four degrees (second-class diver, salvage diver, first-class diver, and master diver) while Army special operations diver badges are awarded in two degrees (diver and diving supervisor). The second-class and first-class diver badges are identical to those issued by U.S. naval forces. The Army does not issue officer or medical diver badges; however, Navy-awarded Diving Officer Insignia, Diving Medical Officer Insignia, and Diving Medical Technician Insignia are authorized for wear on Army uniforms with written approval from the United States Army Human Resources Command.

On 17 September 2004, the Scuba Diver Insignia/Badge was discontinued in lieu of a new Special Operations Diver Badge and an additional grade, the Special Operations Diving Supervisor Badge, was created. Prior to this change, the Scuba Diver Insignia/Badge was the same for all of the U.S. armed forces. The new design includes sharks, symbolizing speed, stealth, and lethal efficiency, and two Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knives in saltire, representing the heritage of OSS operational swimmers during World War II. The Army Combat Diver Qualification Course and Army Combat Diving Supervisors Course are taught by Company C, 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Warfare Training Group at the Special Forces Underwater Operations School, Naval Air Station Key West.
==United States Air Force==

The United States Air Force issues the Air Force Combat Dive Badges to graduates of the Air Force Combat Dive Course at the Navy Diving Salvage and Training Center, Naval Support Activity Panama City.

Until the establishment of the US Air Force Combat Dive Course in 2006, special operations Airmen attended either the U.S. Army Combat Diver Qualification Course, or the U.S. Marine Corps Combatant Diver Course. Airmen attending such courses were awarded the U.S. Navy&#x27;s basic SCUBA diver insignia. The USAF Combat Dive Course would award the same basic SCUBA insignia until 2022. Badges awarded from sister-service combat diver courses, as well as other U.S. Navy dive courses (Diving Medical Officer, etc.) are authorized for wear on U.S. Air Force uniforms.

In October 2022, the United States Air Force approved the new Air Force specific diver badges for graduates of the Air Force Combat Dive Course, replacing their previous use of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s basic SCUBA insignia.

<text>Messier 39 or M39, also known as NGC 7092, is an open cluster of stars in the constellation of Cygnus, sometimes referred to as the Pyramid Cluster. It is positioned two degrees south of the star Pi Cygni and around 9° east-northeast of Deneb. The cluster was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749, then Charles Messier added it to his catalogue in 1764. When observed in a small telescope at low power the cluster shows around two dozen members but is best observed with binoculars. It has a total integrated magnitude (brightness) of 4.6 and spans an angular diameter of – about the size of the full Moon. It is centered about away.

This cluster has an estimated mass of and a linear tidal radius of . Of the 15 brightest components, six form binary star systems; one more is suspected. HD 205117 is a probable eclipsing binary system with a period of 113.2 days that varies by 0.051 in visual magnitude. Both members seem to be subgiants. Within are at least five chemically peculiar stars and ten suspected short-period variable stars.

<doc id="962122" wikidata="Q16043839" url="?curid=962122" title="Sir Samuel Walker, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Samuel Walker, 1st Baronet, PC (Ire), KC (19 June 1832 – 13 August 1911) was an Irish Liberal politician, lawyer and judge. He was the first of the Walker baronets of Pembroke House.

==Career==

He was born at Gore Port, Finea, County Westmeath, a younger son of Captain Alexander Walker and his wife Elizabeth Elliott. He was educated at Portarlington School and Trinity College Dublin. He entered Gray&#x27;s Inn before being called to the bar in 1855. He quickly became one of the leaders of the Irish Chancery bar: in 1872 he was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and eleven years later he became Ireland&#x27;s Solicitor General. The following year, he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Londonderry, a seat he held for little more than a year before the constituency was divided, and in 1885 he was also for a period the island&#x27;s Attorney-General. His celebrated remark that on entering the House of Commons &quot;he was amazed to hear Members making factual statements without sworn affidavits to support them&quot; was probably a joke. He himself rarely spoke in the House, but his rare speeches were enlivened by a dry wit.

An advocate for Home Rule, Walker remained within the Liberal Party after its split, and was eventually appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland when Gladstone returned to power in 1892. When Lord Rosebery&#x27;s ministry fell three years later, he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal, and remained in this capacity until his reappointment as Lord Chancellor by the Liberal government in 1905. He lived at Pembroke Hall, Upper Mount Street in Dublin city. He was created a baronet the following year, and died rather suddenly, while still in office, at his Dublin house Pembroke Hall on 13 August 1911. He is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, beside his first wife Cecilia and his daughter Alice.

==Character and reputation==

He was a lawyer of great ability, and went on to become one of a remarkable group of Irish judges, which included Christopher Palles (served 1874–1916), Gerald FitzGibbon (served 1878–1909), and Hugh Holmes (served 1897–1913), who gave the Irish Court of Appeal, in the years 1890–1910, a reputation for judicial eminence which has never been equalled by any other Irish Court, and could bear comparison with any equivalent English court.

Maurice Healy praised him as &quot;a loyal friend and a man of courage&quot; but thought that these qualities sometimes led him into acts of political recklessness. His insistence on appointing Matthias Bodkin, a leading journalist and a staunch political ally, to a County Court judgeship, was a serious political blunder. Although Bodkin was a qualified barrister, legitimate doubts had been raised by Walker&#x27;s political opponents as to whether he had the necessary years of practice to qualify for appointment to the Bench. The result was an action for quo warranto challenging the validity of Bodkin&#x27;s appointment, which gravely embarrassed the Government, although no harm ultimately came of it: the case was resolved amicably and Bodkin, by general agreement, proved to be an excellent judge.

==Family==

He married firstly in 1855 Cecilia Charlotte Greene, daughter of Arthur Greene and Frances Shaw, and a niece of the eminent judge Richard Wilson Greene, with whom he had six children, including Alexander, the second baronet, and Alice, who died in 1949. Cecilia died in 1880. He married secondly in 1881 Eleanor McLaughlin, with whom he had two more children, including Cecil, who succeeded his half-brother Alexander as third baronet.

Samuel&#x27;s elder brother was General Sir Mark Walker VC KCB.

<text>==Superframe==
In telecommunications, superframe (SF) is a T1 framing standard. In the 1970s it replaced the original T1/D1 framing scheme of the 1960s in which the framing bit simply alternated between 0 and 1.

Superframe is sometimes called D4 Framing to avoid confusion with single-frequency signaling. It was first supported by the D2 channel bank, but it was first widely deployed with the D4 channel bank.

In order to determine where each channel is located in the stream of data being received, each set of 24 channels is aligned in a frame. The frame is 192 bits long (8 * 24), and is terminated with a 193rd bit, the framing bit, which is used to find the end of the frame.

In order for the framing bit to be located by receiving equipment, a predictable pattern is sent on this bit. Equipment will search for a bit which has the correct pattern, and will align its framing based on that bit. The pattern sent is 12 bits long, so every group of 12 frames is called a superframe. The pattern used in the 193rd bit is 100011 011100.

Each channel sends two bits of call supervision data during each superframe using robbed-bit signaling during frames 6 and 12 of the superframe.

More specifically, after the 6th and 12th bit in the superframe pattern, the least significant data bit of each channel (bit 8; T1 data is sent big-endian and uses 1-origin numbering) is replaced by a &quot;channel-associated signalling&quot; bit (bits A and B, respectively).

Superframe remained in service in many places through the turn of the century, replaced by the improved extended superframe (ESF) of the 1980s in applications where its additional features were desired.

==Extended superframe==
In telecommunications, extended superframe (ESF) is a T1 framing standard. ESF is sometimes called D5 Framing because it was first used in the D5 channel bank, invented in the 1980s.

It is preferred to its predecessor, superframe, because it includes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and 4000 bit/s channel capacity for a data link channel (used to pass out-of-band data between equipment.) It requires less frequent synchronization than the earlier superframe format, and provides on-line, real-time of circuit capability and operating condition.

===Structure===
An extended superframe is 24 frames long, and the framing bit of each frame is used in the following manner:
* All odd-numbered frames (1, 3, ..., 23) are used for the data link (totalling 4000 bits per second),
* Frames 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22 are used to pass the CRC total of the previous extended superframe (all 4632 bits, framing and data), and
* Frames 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 are used to send the fixed framing pattern, 001011.

The CRC is computed using the polynomial over all 24×193 = 4632 bits (framing and data) of the previous superframe, but with its framing bits forced to 1 for the purpose of CRC computation. The purpose of this small CRC is not to take any immediate action, but to keep statistics on the performance of the link.

Like the predecessor superframe, every sixth frame&#x27;s least-significant data bit can be used for robbed-bit signaling of call supervision state. However, there are four such bits (ABCD) per channel per extended superframe, rather than the two bits (AB) provided per superframe. 
(Specifically, the robbed bits follow framing bits 6, 12, 18 and 24.)

Unlike the superframe, it is possible to avoid robbed-bit signalling and send call supervision over the data link instead.

<text>Winnecke 4 (also known as Messier 40 or WNC 4) is an optical double star consisting of two unrelated stars in a northerly zone of the sky, Ursa Major.

The pair were discovered by Charles Messier in 1764 while he was searching for a nebula that had been reported in the area by Johannes Hevelius. Not seeing any nebulae, Messier catalogued this apparent pair instead. The pair were rediscovered by Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke in 1863, and included in the Winnecke Catalogue of Double Stars as number 4. Burnham calls M40 &quot;one of the few real mistakes in the Messier catalog,&quot; faulting Messier for including it when all he saw was a double star, not a nebula of any sort.

In 1991 the separation between the components was measured at 51.7″, an increase since 1764. Data gathered by astronomers Brian Skiff (2001) and Richard L. Nugent (2002) strongly suggested the subject was merely an optical double star rather than a physically connected (binary) system. The A star that seems the brighter is over twice as far as B. Parallax measurements from the Gaia satellite show the two stars, HD 238107 and HD 238108, are at distances of and respectively. HD 238108 is itself a genuine binary star, with an 18th magnitude white dwarf companion 5 arcseconds away and a parallax distance of .

<text>Timothy Howard Bishop (born June 1, 1950) is an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative for from 2003 to 2015. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

The district includes most of Central and Eastern Suffolk County, including most of Smithtown, as well as the entirety of the towns of Brookhaven, Riverhead, Southold, Southampton, East Hampton, and Shelter Island. The district encompasses wealthy enclaves such as the Hamptons, middle-class suburban towns such as Selden, Centereach and Lake Grove, working-class neighborhoods such as Mastic and Riverhead, and rural farming communities such as Mattituck and Jamesport on the North Fork.

==Early life, education and career==
Bishop is a twelfth-generation resident of Southampton, New York, where he was born on June 1, 1950. He is the son of Catherine (Roesel) and Howard Cortland Bishop. He is the great-grandson of Benjamin H. Bishop, a mayor of Southampton, and has English, Irish, and German ancestry. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from the College of the Holy Cross and a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Long Island University. Bishop served as Provost of Southampton College for 16 years, where he began working in 1973 as an admissions counselor. He served as the college&#x27;s director of financial aid, assistant director of admissions, registrar, director of institutional research and planning, dean for enrollment services, and dean for administrative and student services.

During his tenure, several academic programs were improved. Southampton College of Long Island University produced 36 Fulbright Scholars. Four new graduate programs were added to the curriculum, and a new academic center, Chancellors Hall, was built.

Along with the Southampton College Chancellor, Robert F. X. Sillerman, Bishop developed the most successful single fund-raising event in the college&#x27;s history, the All for the Sea rock concerts which grossed as much as $1 million annually.

==Congressional tenure==
Bishop supported and voted for the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

Bishop also voted for the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (TARP), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (also known as the &quot;stimulus bill&quot;), and for further measures in 2009 and 2010. He also voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided for further gradual increments in the debt limit.

Bishop participated in the bipartisan coalition of elected officials and community advocates that saved the 106th Air Rescue Wing located at Gabreski Airport from being shut down by the Pentagon&#x27;s base closure commission.

In opposition to a plan that would have dumped more than twenty million cubic yards of contaminated dredge waste in the Long Island Sound, Bishop sponsored legislation to block the plan. In January 2007, he voted for a reduction of interest rates on future federal student loans.

Bishop supported the Shinnecock Indian tribe&#x27;s successful attempts at gaining formal federal recognition. Bishop supported a $160,000 line-item for the Shinnecock Nation in President Obama&#x27;s 2013 budget proposal.

===Ethics investigation===

In September 2013, the Office of Congressional Ethics recommended further review of an August 2012 incident in which Bishop was accused of soliciting a campaign contribution from hedge fund magnate Eric Semler in exchange for acting in an official capacity to obtain a fireworks permit for Semler&#x27;s son&#x27;s bar mitzvah on Long Island. Bishop denied the allegations as &quot;outrageous, unfounded attacks on my character and my family&quot;. After the incident was picked up by the media, Semler called the allegations a &quot;nonstory&quot;.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the incident. In September 2014, the Justice Department closed its investigation without filing charges, although the ethics probe remained open until Bishop left office in January 2015. The falling out from the incident, along with the 2013 redistricting which made the 1st more favorable to Republicans, was cited as a factor in Bishop&#x27;s failed re-election in 2014.

==Political campaigns==

;2002

In his first political race, Bishop ran as a Democrat against Republican incumbent Felix J. Grucci, Jr. During the campaign, Grucci ran radio ads accusing Bishop of falsifying rape statistics at Southampton College, but his claims were based on articles from a college newspaper that contained numerous inaccuracies. Grucci refused to repudiate the ads, and was defeated by Bishop.

;2004

Incumbent Bishop beat Republican William M. Manger, Jr. 56.2%-43.8%

;2006

Incumbent Bishop beat Republican Italo Zanzi 62.2%-37.8%

;2008

Incumbent Bishop defeated Republican Lee Zeldin 58%-42% and was re-elected.

;2010

Bishop narrowly defeated Republican Randy Altschuler by a margin of 50.2% to 49.8% after Altschuler conceded the race when trailing by 263 votes.

;2012

Bishop again defeated Republican Randy Altschuler by a 52.2% to 47.8% margin. Although Bishop received the Independence Party endorsement in most of his previous elections, in 2012 the endorsement went instead to his opponent.

;2014

Bishop ran unopposed for the Democratic, Working Families and Independence Party nominations. He was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#x27;s Frontline Program, a program designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents heading into the 2014 election. He faced Republican nominee Lee Zeldin, whom he had defeated in 2008, in the general election.
On November 4, 2014, Bishop lost his re-election bid to Zeldin 55% to 45%.

==Post-Congressional career==
After leaving Congress, Bishop joined St. Joseph&#x27;s University as a distinguished professor of Civic Engagement and Public Service. 

Bishop is a senior advisor to a Washington, D.C.–based government relations firm.

Bishop has accepted positions on the Board of Directors of Social Accountability International and The Sergeant Sullivan Center. Both commitments allow Bishop to continue on two of his top priorities in the Congress — working to ensure workplace protections and services to U.S. veterans, particularly in the area of post deployment health.

On March 20, 2018, Bishop was confirmed by the Suffolk County Legislature to a five-year term on the Suffolk County Water Authority (SCWA).

==Personal life==
Bishop is married to Kathryn, founder and director of The Children&#x27;s School Early Childhood program at Southampton College, and has two daughters, Molly and Meghan. He is a Roman Catholic.

<doc id="962148" wikidata="Q13760" url="?curid=962148" title="Beehive Cluster">
<text>The Beehive Cluster (also known as Praesepe (Latin for &quot;manger&quot;, &quot;cot&quot; or &quot;crib&quot;), M44, NGC 2632, or Cr 189), is an open cluster in the constellation Cancer. One of the nearest open clusters to Earth, it contains a larger population of stars than other nearby bright open clusters holding around 1,000 stars. Under dark skies, the Beehive Cluster looks like a small nebulous object to the naked eye, and has been known since ancient times. Classical astronomer Ptolemy described it as a &quot;nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer&quot;. It was among the first objects that Galileo studied with his
telescope.

Age and proper motion coincide with those of the Hyades, suggesting they may share similar origins. Both clusters also contain red giants and white dwarfs, which represent later stages of stellar evolution, along with many main sequence stars.

Distance to M44 is often cited to be between 160 and 187 parsecs (520–610 light years), but the revised Hipparcos parallaxes (2009) for Praesepe members and the latest infrared color-magnitude diagram favors an analogous distance of 182 pc. There are better age estimates of around 600 million years (compared to about 625 million years for the Hyades). The diameter of the bright inner cluster core is about 7.0 parsecs (23 light years).

At 1.5° across, the cluster easily fits within the field of view of binoculars or low-powered small telescopes. Regulus, Castor, and Pollux are guide stars. 

== History ==
In 1609, Galileo first telescopically observed the Beehive and was able to resolve it into 40 stars. Charles Messier added it to his famous catalog in 1769 after precisely measuring its position in the sky. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Pleiades cluster, Messier&#x27;s inclusion of the Beehive has been noted as curious, as most of Messier&#x27;s objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets. Another possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalog than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalog contained 42 objects, and so he added some well-known bright objects to boost his list. Wilhelm Schur, as director of the Göttingen Observatory, drew a map of the cluster in 1894.Ancient Greeks and Romans saw this object as a manger from which two donkeys, the adjacent stars Asellus Borealis and Asellus Australis, are eating; these are the donkeys that Dionysos and Silenus rode into battle against the Titans.

Hipparchus (&quot;c&quot;.130 BC) refers to the cluster as &quot;Nephelion&quot; (&quot;Little Cloud&quot;) in his star catalog. Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; includes the Beehive Cluster as one of seven &quot;nebulae&quot; (four of which are real), describing it as &quot;The Nebulous Mass in the Breast (of Cancer)&quot;. Aratus (&quot;c&quot;.260–270 BC) calls the cluster &quot;Achlus&quot; or &quot;Little Mist&quot; in his poem &quot;Phainomena&quot;.

Johann Bayer showed the cluster as a nebulous star on his Uranometria atlas of 1603, and labeled it Epsilon. The letter is now applied specifically to the brightest star of the cluster Epsilon Cancri, of magnitude 6.29.

This perceived nebulous object is in the Ghost (Gui Xiu), the 23rd lunar mansion of ancient Chinese astrology. Ancient Chinese skywatchers saw this as a ghost or demon riding in a carriage and likened its appearance to a &quot;cloud of pollen blown from willow catkins&quot;. It was also known by the somewhat less romantic name of &quot;Jishi qi&quot; (積屍氣, also transliterated &quot;Tseih She Ke&quot;), the &quot;Exhalation of Piled-up Corpses&quot;. It is also known simply as Jishi (積屍), &quot;cumulative corpses&quot;.

== Morphology and composition ==
Like many star clusters of all kinds, Praesepe has experienced mass segregation. This means that bright massive stars are concentrated in the cluster&#x27;s core, while dimmer and less massive stars populate its halo (sometimes called the &quot;corona&quot;). The cluster&#x27;s core radius is estimated at 3.5 parsecs (11.4 light years); its half-mass radius is about 3.9 parsecs (12.7 light years); and its tidal radius is about 12 parsecs (39 light years). However, the tidal radius also includes many stars that are merely &quot;passing through&quot; and not &quot;bona fide&quot; cluster members.
Altogether, the cluster contains at least 1000 gravitationally bound stars, for a total mass of about 500–600 Solar masses. A recent survey counts 1010 high-probability members, of which 68% are M dwarfs, 30% are Sun-like stars of spectral classes F, G, and K, and about 2% are bright stars of spectral class A. Also present are five giant stars, four of which have spectral class K0 III and the fifth G0 III.

So far, eleven white dwarfs have been identified, representing the final evolutionary phase of the cluster&#x27;s most massive stars, which originally belonged to spectral type B. Brown dwarfs, however, are rare in this cluster, probably because they have been lost by tidal stripping from the halo. A brown dwarf has been found in the eclipsing binary system AD 3116.

The cluster has a visual brightness of magnitude 3.7. Its brightest stars are blue-white and of magnitude 6 to 6.5. 42 Cancri is a confirmed member.
== Planets ==
In September 2012, two planets which orbit separate stars were discovered in the Beehive Cluster. The finding was significant for being the first planets detected orbiting stars like Earth&#x27;s Sun that were situated in stellar clusters. Planets had previously been detected in such clusters, but not orbiting stars like the Sun.

The planets have been designated Pr0201 b and Pr0211 b. The &#x27;b&#x27; at the end of their names indicates that the bodies are planets. The discoveries are what have been termed hot Jupiters, massive gas giants that, unlike the planet Jupiter, orbit very close to their parent stars.

The announcement describing the planetary finds, written by Sam Quinn as the lead author, was published in the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot; Letters. Quinn&#x27;s team worked with David Latham of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, utilizing the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory&#x27;s Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory.

In 2016 additional observations found a second planet in the Pr0211 system, Pr0211 c. This made Pr0211 the first multi-planet system to be discovered in an open cluster.

The Kepler space telescope, in its K2 mission, discovered planets around several more stars in the Beehive Cluster. The stars K2-95, K2-100, K2-101, K2-102, K2-103, and K2-104 host a single planet each, and K2-264 has a two-planet system.

<text>The thick line policy (Polish: gruba kreska, &quot;thick stroke&quot;, or gruba linia, &quot;thick line&quot;) was the term used by prime minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, in the exposé[pl] delivered in the Sejm, on September 12th 1989.

He said, &quot;We split away the history of our recent past with &quot;a thick line&quot;. We will be responsible only for what we have done to help extract Poland from her current predicament, from now on&quot;. (&quot;Przeszłość odkreślamy grubą linią. Odpowiadać będziemy jedynie za to, co uczyniliśmy, by wydobyć Polskę z obecnego stanu załamania.&quot;)

In more recent years, his intentions were considered by many people, and his &quot;gruba kreska&quot; is often understood as a policy of nonpunishment for crimes committed by the communist regime of pre-1989 Poland.

<text>Messier 43 or M43, also known as De Mairan&#x27;s Nebula and NGC 1982, is a star-forming nebula with a prominent H II region in the equatorial constellation of Orion. It was discovered by the French scientist Jean-Jacques d&#x27;Ortous de Mairan some time before 1731, then catalogued by Charles Messier in 1769. It is physically part of the Orion Nebula (Messier 42), separate from that main nebula by a dense lane of dust known as the northeast dark lane. It is part of the much larger Orion molecular cloud complex.

The main ionizing star in this nebula is HD 37061 (variable star designation NU Ori), the focus of the H II region, away. This is a triple star system with the brighter component being a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The main component is a blue-white hued B-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of B0.5V or B1V. It has times the mass of the Sun () and times the Sun&#x27;s radius (). It is radiating over 26,000 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity () from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 31,000 K. It is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of around 200 km/s.

The H II region is a roundish volume of ionized hydrogen. It has a diameter of about , at its distance meaning it measures . The net (meaning omitting the star) hydrogen alpha luminosity of this region is ; equivalent to . There is a dark lane crossing the whole west-centre strip from north to south, known as the M43 dark lane, which forming a swirling belt extension to the south links to Orion&#x27;s northeast dark lane. All of these resemble a mixture of smoke rising from a chimney and in watercolour broad and fine dark brushstrokes, at many wavelengths.

<text>Robert A. Brady (born April 7, 1945) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1998 to 2019. He was the ranking Democrat and Chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration from 2007 to 2019. He has served as Chairman of the Philadelphia Democratic Party since 1986 and is a registered lobbyist for NBC Universal and Independence Blue Cross.

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
Brady was born in Philadelphia, the son of Enez (née Caterini) and Robert G. Brady, a police officer. His father was of Irish descent, and his maternal grandparents were immigrants from Italy. His mother Enez was also a Democratic committee member. He graduated from St. Thomas More High School and Martin Technical School but did not attend college, instead going to work as a carpenter and member of Carpenters Local 8. He became a part of the leadership of the union and remains a member of several unions.

He was elected a division committeeman for the Democratic Party in 1968. In 1974, his mentor and ward leader George X. Schwartz got him a job as a sergeant-at-arms in Philadelphia City Council. When Schwartz stepped down as ward leader in 1982 and eventually went to jail in the wake of the Abscam scandal, Brady was elected to succeed him as Democratic Leader of west Philadelphia&#x27;s 34th Ward, a position that he still holds today.

In 1983 Brady ran for an at-large seat on Philadelphia City Council. He was endorsed by Frank Rizzo and lost in the primary election. After Wilson Goode won the 1983 Philadelphia mayoral election, Brady joined Goode&#x27;s staff as liaison with organized labor. In 1986 he worked as an economic consultant on City Council&#x27;s Economic Development Committee.

Since June 1986, Brady has been the Chairman of the Philadelphia Democratic Party.

Brady has been a professor at the University of Pennsylvania where he instructs graduate students in management and political science. In April 1991 he was appointed to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission by Governor Bob Casey Sr., a position he held until his election to United States Congress in 1998.

In 1999 he married Debra Savarese, a former Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

In November 1997, 17-year U.S. Congressman Tom Foglietta resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives after being named U.S. Ambassador to Italy by Bill Clinton. After a 1992 redistricting, the First District was becoming a majority Black district. Foglietta had defeated Black candidates in Democratic primaries in 1994 and 1996 and political observers assumed that his successor would be Black. In February 1998, Brady announced he would be running in the special election for Foglietta&#x27;s vacated seat, despite not living within the district. When asked his position on NAFTA, Brady said &quot;I don&#x27;t know what that was about.&quot; When asked his position on abortion Brady said he had no position. On May 11, Brady left a debate between the congressional candidates early to attend a ward meeting.

The special election and primary election were held on May 19, 1998, with Brady running in both elections. He faced three opponents in the special election and three in the primary election. Brady won the special election with 74% of the vote and the primary election with 59% of the vote. His closest challenger in the Democratic primary was State Representative Andrew Carn, who received 21% of the vote. Brady was sworn in by Newt Gingrich on May 21, 1998.

In his first general election in November 1998 he defeated Republican William M. Harrison, winning 81% of the vote. In his victory speech he defended President Bill Clinton, saying &quot;We have business to take care of in Washington and it&#x27;s not this business of embarrassing our President.&quot;

Brady represented a heavily Democratic district and easily won each of his ten full terms, receiving at least 81% of the vote in each race and twice running unopposed. Republican Deborah Williams ran against Brady twice, in 2004 and 2016.

===Tenure===

In his 20 years in Congress, Brady was the primary sponsor of 14 pieces of legislation that were enacted into law and co-sponsored 200 bills that became law. Legislation that he co-sponsored mostly covered the areas of government operation, crime and law enforcement and transportation and public works. He voted against free trade deals and against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. As a member of the United States House Committee on Armed Services, Brady was one of a select few permitted to view photos of the corpse of Osama bin Laden. &quot;Oh he&#x27;s dead,&quot; said Brady, &quot;It&#x27;s quite graphic. His brain and everything are coming out.&quot;

During the course of his congressional career, Brady estimated he helped bring $15.5 billion in federal funds to Philadelphia.

====Corruption case====
In November 2017, it was revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating Brady for payments that Brady&#x27;s campaign made in 2012 to an opponent in order to get the opponent to withdraw from the race. In January 2018, facing multiple declared primary opponents, he announced that he would not seek reelection. He said that his decision had nothing to do with the ongoing corruption probe, but that he instead wanted to spend more time with his family. As a result of these investigations, longtime Brady aides Ken Smuckler and Donald &quot;D.A.&quot; Jones were both convicted of violating federal law and each sentenced to over a year in prison for their role in facilitating and covering up the $90,000 payment to a former Brady primary opponent.

=== Political positions ===
Brady is pro-choice and voted against President Bush&#x27;s restrictions on funding to family planning groups in 2001. Over the years, he has supported minors&#x27; abortion rights, voting in 2005 for the right for those under 18 years of age to obtain abortions across state lines without parental consent. He voted against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which prohibits health insurance companies from offering abortion coverage in a plan to any citizen. He opposed a proposal to prohibit federally funded abortion services. Over the past fifteen years, organizations such as the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL), the National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Association, and Planned Parenthood rated him 100%.

Brady voted in favor of the Small Business Lending Fund and Tax Law Amendment. The September 2010 amendment provides loans to small business through financial institutions. He supported the Small Business Jobs Bill in October 2010.

Brady voted against the Secure Fence Act (2006), which authorized the construction of additional fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as the Immigration Law Enforcement Act of 2006. He supports Homeland Security Appropriations for border protection and The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Technology project, which works towards improving the capability of the government to keep track of immigrants and control their entry and exit. Groups such as the National Latino Congreso/William C. Velásquez Institute, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the anti-immigration Federation for American Immigration Reform have rated Brady between 50% and 100% for his pro-immigration political stances.

===Attention to constituents===

Brady claims to have once refused to receive a phone call from President Bill Clinton because he was busy helping a woman who had called seeking someone to come over and fix her toilet.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Military Personnel
* Committee on House Administration (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Elections (Ranking Member)

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Arts Caucus
*House Baltic Caucus

== Philadelphia Democratic City Committee ==

Brady has been chair of the Philadelphia Democratic Party since June 1986, when he replaced previous chair Joseph Smith. In his first bid for chair, Brady had the support of Wilson Goode, Lucien Blackwell, and the majority of Philadelphia&#x27;s 69 Democratic ward leaders, who felt Philadelphia&#x27;s Democratic Party was suffering from fragmentation, low-morale and financial trouble after losing the District Attorney race to Republican Ron Castille. He was elected by a vote of 44–23.

Wilson Goode credited Brady for his victory over Frank Rizzo in the 1987 Philadelphia mayoral election, saying &quot;without Bob Brady being the party chair, it was possible I could have lost the election.&quot;

A power struggle played out in the 1990 Democratic primary, with Brady&#x27;s three party-backed candidates losing to candidates backed by William H. Gray III and the &quot;Northwest Coalition&quot;, a group of high turnout Democratic wards in Philadelphia. After these losses Brady&#x27;s leadership of the party was questioned but ultimately he won a new four-year term as chair. Wilson Goode supported Brady&#x27;s re-election as chair, saying &quot;Under Bob Brady&#x27;s leadership, the Democratic Party has been more unified than it ever has been in the past two decades.&quot;

After winning election to US Congress in 1998, he would say that he still considered running Philadelphia&#x27;s Democratic Party his top priority.

In 2003, protestors surrounded Democratic Party headquarters as Democratic committee members were inside considering primary endorsements. Protestors were demanding the resignation of party treasurer Johnny Dougherty over allegations that Dougherty, in his other role as a labor union leader, denied Black workers from being selected to work on taxpayer funded projects.

The Democratic City Committee holds sway in judicial elections, where candidates will pay the party upwards of $35,000 for placement on a sample ballot. Brady has a large influence on this process, saying &quot;I&#x27;m told I elect judges. That is the hand that was dealt me as party chairman 20 years ago.&quot;

Through his tenure as chair, political consultants have praised his ability to unify the party.

Brady has received criticism for the low turnout in Philadelphia&#x27;s Democratic primaries, which has been as low as 10%. Had Hillary Clinton received just 27 additional votes in each Philadelphia polling place, she would&#x27;ve won Pennsylvania&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2016 United States presidential election.

During the 2019 Philadelphia City Council elections, Working Families Party candidates Kendra Brooks and Nicolas O&#x27;Rourke were running for two seats reserved for minority party candidates. Despite this being no threat to Democratic candidates running for City Council, Brady threatened expulsion of Democratic ward leaders and committee members who supported Working Families Party candidates.

In June 2020, Northeast Philadelphia ward leader Brian Eddis called on Brady to resign as chair due to &quot;lack of diversity in the party.&quot; Brady called a meeting of clergy members and party officials to discuss how to handle racial justice protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the violent confrontations that had occurred near the statue of Christopher Columbus in Marconi Plaza. No consensus was reached.

In March 2021, Brady reportedly asked the candidate for the Court of Common Pleas Caroline Turner to drop out of the race in exchange for his help in getting her a judicial appointment at a later date. Brady also reportedly warned that she would not get the endorsement of Philadelphia&#x27;s 2nd Democratic Ward. Brady and the Philadelphia Democratic City Committee disputed the memo&#x27;s claim through an attorney and asserted no such ask ever took place. The Intercept reported, &quot;Louis Agre, a lawyer for the city party said that Turner requested the meeting. &quot;She said she wanted to show respect,&quot; he said. Agre, who also represents Philadelphia&#x27;s 21st Ward on the city committee, said that Brady said he never asked her, or anyone else, to drop out of the race, nor did he offer support for a judgeship appointment. &quot;He never asked her to get out of the race, he never threatened her,&quot; Agre said.&quot; The 2nd Ward later endorsed Turner on March 25. Turner would go on to be defeated by Philadelphia Democratic City Committee-endorsed candidates in the Primary election.

==2007 Philadelphia mayoral campaign==
On January 25, 2007 Brady announced that he would seek the Democratic Party nomination for mayor of Philadelphia. He was the second sitting U.S. Congressman after Chaka Fattah to announce his candidacy for mayor. On March 6, Brady failed to list his city pension on the financial-interests statement he filed with his nominating petitions. Within a week Milton Street filed a petition challenge to remove Brady from the ballot for failing to disclose his pension income. Another challenge was brought by a group of voters, and supported by mayoral candidates Tom Knox and Dwight Evans. On April 13, 2007, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that Brady&#x27;s failure to not list part of his income would not keep him off the primary ballot. On May 15, 2007, Brady lost the Democratic mayoral primary to Michael Nutter, finishing third in a seven candidate field

== Power and influence ==

*&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; described him as &quot;the longtime boss of the Democratic City Committee, one of the few old-fashioned big-city political machines left. Running against him could equal career suicide.&quot;
*Politico described him as &quot;the old-school politician and party boss — known in Congress as a fixer and backroom dealmaker.&quot;
* In 2001, the political website PoliticsPA described him as a &quot;consummate &#x27;backroom politician&#x27; (and we say that with respect!)&quot; and said that he might be the best county party chair in Pennsylvania. In 2003, the &quot;Pennsylvania Report&quot; said that Brady has &quot;managed effectively to balance his multiracial district and city Democratic party.&quot;
* In 2009, the &quot;Pennsylvania Report&quot; noted that &quot;[w]hile he still would like to be Mayor, Brady&#x27;s influence and power in Philadelphia remains strong.&quot;
* Pennsylvania State Senator Anthony Williams said he is &quot;probably one of the most politically astute politicians in the last 20 years, and that&#x27;s rarefied air.&quot; J. Whyatt Mondesire, head of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP, said no one can match &quot;Brady&#x27;s relationships with politicians across the Democratic landscape.&quot;
*In 2015, during Pope Francis&#x27;s visit to the United States, he stole the glass that the Pope drank from and then drank from it himself, had his wife and two others drink from it, had Sen. Bob Casey, his wife and mother as well as Rep. Joseph Crowley stick their fingers in the glass. He said he also planned to have the Philadelphia police dust the glass to lift the Pope&#x27;s fingerprints. Brady said, &quot;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s blessed if the Pope drank out of it. Why not?&quot; and &quot;If not, I&#x27;m saying it is.&quot; Additionally, in 2009, Brady stole the glass used by former President Barack Obama after his inauguration.
*Congressman Brady has many times been a teller for the Joint session of the United States Congress to count and certify the Electoral College vote for president and Vice President. Congressman Brady is noted for incorrectly stating &quot;Electoral Vote&quot;; he instead says &quot;Electorial Vote&quot;

<text>The Centrelink Master Program, or more commonly known as Centrelink, is a Services Australia master program of the Australian Government. It delivers a range of government payments and services for retirees, the unemployed, families, carers, parents, people with disabilities, Indigenous Australians, students, apprentices and people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and provides services at times of major change. The majority of Centrelink&#x27;s services are the disbursement of social security payments.

==History and operations==
Centrelink commenced initially as a government agency of the Department of Social Security under the trading name of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency in early 1997. Following the passage of the &quot;Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997&quot;, the Centrelink brand name came into effect in late 1997. Offices were established nationally to manage services to people in need of social security payments. 

On 1 July 2011, Centrelink, together with Medicare Australia, was integrated into the Department of Human Services as a result of the , with the department retaining the brand name as part of its set of master programs.

In 2016, Concentrix, a business services company and subsidiary of U.S.-based SYNNEX Corporation, was one of the companies awarded a contract to operate call centres for Centrelink.

Another company awarded a call centre operating contract by Centrelink is Stellar, a subsidiary of the Nevada-registered U.S. company Stellar LLC.

Following the re-election of the Morrison Federal government in May 2019, the Department of Human Services was renamed Services Australia.

==&quot;Robodebt&quot; automated debt recovery scandal==

=== Origin ===
In 2016, Centrelink began using a new automated technique (later found to be fatally flawed and unlawful) for reconciling welfare recipients&#x27; records against data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in order to allegedly uncover fraud and overpayment, thus facilitating the scrape-back of these alleged debts from clients. In January 2017, it was reported that the scheme was touted to save the government $300m and consideration was also being given to recovery action against Centrelink clients on both the Aged Pension and the Disability Support Pension, which allegedly could have raised in revenue. In a process that had previously seen 20,000 debt recovery letters issued per year, this new automated data-matching technique, with less human oversight, saw that number increase to 169,000 letters during July-December 2016. 

=== Injustice, trauma, and suicide ===
Critics and opponents of the automated process revealed and documented that the errors in the system, which became known colloquially as &#x27;Robodebt&#x27; (a title later used officially), had coerced welfare recipients into paying either nonexistent debts, or debts that were vastly larger than what they actually may have owed, with the real amount often being a trivial sum of a few dollars or nothing at all. Some welfare recipients were required by Centrelink to make repayments for the fabricated debts while having to simultaneously engage in official reviews and legal challenges to the sham debt claims.

In some cases, the debts being pursued dated back further than the standard Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink mandates for Australian taxpayers and beneficiaries to retain their financial documentation (normally 5 years). In one related case, a Tasmanian pensioner was asked for financial records dating back almost 18 years.
The Robodebt scheme also normalised a Centrelink process that reversed the onus of proof that any claimed debt was factual; Centrelink did not require its staff to verify and prove that the information being used to raise the debt claims was accurate. Instead, the individual accused of the debt (often a bogus or wildly inflated figure) was required to prove they did not owe the funds, often with no access to their financial records that had frequently been lost, destroyed, or legitimately disposed of as authorised by the governmental policy requirements for record retention. Human interaction in the fact-checking and dispatch of the debt letters was extremely limited, with the process relying on a ubiquitous level of automation based on fatally flawed software algorithms (prompting the creation of the &#x27;Robodebt&#x27; moniker).

The injustice was further compounded by the ongoing failure of Centrelink call centres and office staff to respond and act within any reasonable time to investigate and correct the bogus debt accusations targeting so many of its clients, with Centrelink&#x27;s telephone call centres having long become perennially notorious for either failing to be contactable by phone (with all lines often permanently engaged for days on end) or for automating the answering of calls and then keeping their clients &#x27;on hold&#x27; for extended periods, sometimes lasting for many hours, as well as subjecting these calls to frequent random hang-ups. Numerous allegations of callous &amp; heavy-handed tactics by Centrelink &amp; its contracted private debt collectors resulted in reports that some recipients had been psychologically traumatised and that there had been consequent suicides, including the tragic case of Corey Web, who had been vulnerable and struggling to repay a Robodebt when he took his own life in 2017.

=== Parliamentary investigation and legal challenges ===
In March 2017, the Robodebt program was the subject of a Senate committee inquiry, where the department was asked how many people had become deceased after receiving a letter under the debt recovery program. After the question was taken on notice, the department was asked again in a subsequent inquiry hearing, and it was again taken on notice. Despite numerous and widespread concerns being raised about Robodebt, the 2018 Australian federal budget indicated that the data matching scheme would be expanded further.

In February 2019, Legal Aid Victoria announced that they would challenge the method that Centrelink uses to calculate a person&#x27;s income, with a spokesperson for Legal Aid stating that the calculation method used was &quot;crude&quot; and failed to take into account the variation in work periods and hours that many recipients had to juggle, thus rendering any income &amp; consequent debt claim as false. Nine months later in November, the federal government settled the case and admitted that the figures produced by Robodebt&#x27;s income averaging algorithm (for calculating people&#x27;s income &amp; consequent debt) were &quot;not validly made&quot; and were unlawful.

In September 2019, Gordon Legal announced their intention of filing a class-action suit challenging the legal foundations of the Robodebt scheme, and in June 2021 it was announced that the class action had been successfulll and Justice Bernard Murphy had approved a settlement that the ABC reported was worth at least $1.8billion to the people wrongfully pursued as a result of Robodebt, and an additional amount of $8.4million was owing to Gordon Legal for their work.

=== Robodebt finally scrapped ===
On 29 May 2020, Stuart Robert, Minister for Government Services announced that the &#x27;robo-debt&#x27; debt recovery scheme was to be scrapped by the Government, with 470,000 wrongly issued debts to be repaid in full. The total sum of the repayments is estimated to be . Opposition Government Services spokesperson Bill Shorten criticised the Government&#x27;s lack of apology for the scheme, citing the psychological harm to many of those issued with debt recovery notices.

=== Royal Commission ===
While the federal Labor Party was in opposition prior to the May 2022 federal elections, it committed to establishing a Royal Commission to investigate the Robodebt scandal and, following Labor&#x27;s return to government as a result of their winning that poll, the new Albanese Labor government announced the establishment on 18 August 2022 of the Royal Commission which, in its final report of 7 July 2023, denounced the Robodebt scheme as both fundamentally flawed and unlawful, making adverse findings against the ministers responsible for its oversight as well as a number of senior public service officials, all of whose actions the commission found to be reprehensible.

<doc id="962170" wikidata="Q6952494" url="?curid=962170" title="History of NASCAR schedule realignments">
<text>History of NASCAR schedule realignments refers to changes in the schedule of the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.

==First Cup schedule in 1949==
The first season in 1949 consists of 8 races, exclusively on dirt tracks. The season began on June, 19 at Charlotte Speedway, a 3/4-mile short track in the Charlotte area in North Carolina The second race took place on the first Sunday after Independence Day (July 10) at Daytona Beach in Florida. The third race was run at Occoneechee Speedway (Hillsboro, North Carolina) on the first Sunday in August. In September, there were three races, first at Langhorne Speedway in Pennsylvania, second at Hamburg Speedway in New York and third at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia. The last two races, one at Heidelberg Raceway near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and one at North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Carolina, was run in October, with the last race run at Sunday the 16th.

==1972 Changes==
1972 was the first year of NASCAR&#x27;s &#x27;modern era&#x27;. All races for the Cup Series at ovals under 0.5 miles in length (and under 250 miles in distance), and dirt ovals, were removed from the schedule, that included popular tracks like Greenville-Pickens Speedway, Hickory Motor Speedway, and Columbia Speedway. Some of these venues were still used for races in NASCAR&#x27;s second-tier series.

This resulted in the Cup schedule being reduced from 48 races, to 31, with all races now being run on the weekends to reduce exhausting travel for the teams and drivers, and to maximize attendance/viewership (with the exception of the Southern 500, which ran on Labor Day). 

==2003 announcement==
In a January 2003 press conference, NASCAR&#x27;s chairman of the board, Bill France Jr., caused a stir when he interrupted the conference to announce big changes for 2004. France said that many tracks were under fire and being looked at as having race dates taken from them, and given to other facilities. Among the scenarios being looked at by France were how tracks did with ticket sales, and how the weather affected those races. Two tracks immediately looked at by the media were the North Carolina Speedway and Darlington Raceway. Both tracks&#x27; events at the time almost never sold out, and the weather, especially at the North Carolina Speedway, had been a major problem, as rain forced many races to be postponed until the next day, typically Monday, which caused attendance to be even worse.

==Realignment 2004==
&quot;Realignment 2004&quot; was announced in June 2003 at the Winston Cup race weekend at the Michigan International Speedway. While there were only a few changes, they were major. In June 1997, Auto Club Speedway began hosting a Winston Cup race. The track is located in Fontana, California, just outside Los Angeles, and so many fans flocked to the first race, and very quickly, the Los Angeles area became NASCAR&#x27;s largest market. So, it was announced that Darlington&#x27;s Mountain Dew Southern 500, held on Labor Day weekend for 54 years, would be moved to November for 2004, alienating the fan base of long time NASCAR fans. In the process, Rockingham&#x27;s November date, the Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400, would move to Fontana, become the Pop Secret 500, and be run from the late evening into the night on the West Coast on the day before Labor Day, while also being shown live on NBC in primetime. The move of the race to September left Rockingham with just one race to run in 2004 — its February date, the Subway 400.

==Realignment 2005==
&quot;Realignment 2004&quot; was unpopular with many, but unlike &quot;realignment 2005&quot;, the previous realignment in the schedule was not tied in with a lawsuit. In April 1997 the Winston Cup Series began racing at the newly built Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. Bruton Smith&#x27;s Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (which also oversees operations of tracks in Bristol, Tennessee, Hampton, Georgia, Loudon, New Hampshire, and Concord, North Carolina, all of which have two race dates a year) thought that the first race at Texas was popular enough to warrant another date. Soon, the company began pressing NASCAR to give them another date, but NASCAR refused to grant the track a second race.

Early in the 2000s, SMI shareholder Francis Ferko filed a lawsuit against NASCAR, saying that it failed to come through on a promise to give Texas a second date. NASCAR denied making any promise of any kind. (Ferko filed the suit on his own; Smith did not want any part of the it.)

In May 2004, NASCAR announced that they and Texas Speedway had reached a settlement. As part of the settlement ISC sold North Carolina Speedway to SMI, who in turn gave the race to Texas. This not only cost Rockingham its Nextel Cup date, but left it with no dates in any of NASCAR&#x27;s national racing series in 2005 (the track&#x27;s remaining Busch Series date was removed, and at the time the track had never had a Truck series date). However, the loss of a NASCAR presence would ultimately prove a blessing in disguise for Rockingham; it is now one of the most heavily used venues for testing by NASCAR teams now that testing is prohibited at any track that hosts races in any NASCAR touring series.

The second track to lose a race was Darlington, whose slot in the Chase for the Nextel Cup was given to Texas. Darlington was then left with its spring date, which was moved to Mother&#x27;s Day weekend (a traditional off-weekend for the Cup Series) and lengthened to 500 miles.

In addition to Texas gaining a second race, for the first time since its debut on the Cup schedule in 1988 Phoenix was granted a second date, this one in an early season slot following the spring race at Texas.

NASCAR also moved the Auto Club 500, the spring race at Fontana, into Rockingham&#x27;s slot on the schedule (the race immediately following the Daytona 500.)

==Realignment 2006–2007==
After its Cup Series realignment plans, NASCAR turned to its second tier series, the Busch Series, for realignment in 2006. ISC purchased Pikes Peak International Raceway in Fountain, Colorado and immediately took its race from the Busch schedule, replacing it with an event at Martinsville Speedway.

As quickly as the race at Martinsville was added to the schedule, it was removed in favor of a race in Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, adding a third road course to the series schedule.

The Nextel Cup Series schedule was left untouched during this time.

===Reasons for Rockingham and Darlington losing their races===
NASCAR has stated that Rockingham and Darlington lost their dates because they were not selling all the tickets for those events, and that giving Darlington only one date would make a sellout more likely since it would be the only race taking place there the following year.

Also, races at both tracks had been affected by rain many times over the past few years. Even if there was no rain, it was usually overcast. Darlington&#x27;s only race taking place in May also put the scheduling of the race in the peak tornado season in the Southeast.

However, Darlington&#x27;s future seems secure, with a total sellout for the lone race from 2005 through 2008, and with many major projects being planned or done at the speedway. Due to the sellouts the track owners have considered adding more seats.

==Realignment 2009–10==
The 2009 season, announced on August 19, 2008, went under a realignment once again after a long break. The fall race at Talladega Superspeedway was moved to a later date on the schedule around Halloween (the first Sunday in November or the final Sunday in October), one previously occupied by Atlanta Motor Speedway&#x27;s fall event. That race was moved to Labor Day weekend, where California Speedway&#x27;s inherited autumn event from Darlington had been, and that date was switched to Talladega&#x27;s old date on the first weekend of October. In addition, the Nationwide Series dropped Mexico City&#x27;s road course race for a new race in August at the Iowa Speedway, and moved the Montreal event to an open weekend on the Sprint Cup schedule (August 30) with their lone Atlanta race moving to the Labor Day weekend from March. The Camping World Truck Series replaced the spring Milwaukee Mile race with a race at Iowa Speedway to be run on August 26, and also replaced the Memorial Day weekend race at Mansfield Motorsports Park with a race later in the season at Pocono Raceway for the first time in the series&#x27; history. In 2010, the NCWTS also got rid of its second race at Auto Club Speedway. This moved all races back one weekend in the season until the first weekend of August, where a race was added at Darlington Raceway, which was put in place after an absence on the series&#x27; schedule in the previous season. Other changes included a race at Kentucky Speedway being moved from the summer to the fall.

==Realignment 2011==
Major schedule changes were announced to combat poor attendance and poor television ratings, both of which had dropped considerably since the introduction of the Generation-5 car and for other reasons.

===Sprint Cup===

*Atlanta Motor Speedway&#x27;s spring date was discontinued in favor of the Labor Day weekend date.
*Kentucky Speedway hosted its first Sprint Cup Series race, the Quaker State 400, with room being made for it by dropping the spring Atlanta race. The formal announcement was made on August 10, 2010, and the race took the post-Coke Zero 400 slot held by Chicagoland Speedway.
*Chicagoland became the opening race to the 2011 Chase for the Sprint Cup.
*New Hampshire Motor Speedway hosted the second race in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, as the Sylvania 300 was moved back one week due to Chicagoland gaining the opening Chase race.
*Kansas Speedway gained a spring race date. The race was run in early June immediately following the Coca-Cola 600.
*Auto Club Speedway lost its fall race and Chase for the Sprint Cup date, the Pepsi Max 400. The spring race, the Auto Club 500, was moved from February to March and shortened to 400 miles/200 laps.
*The spring race at Texas Motor Speedway was run on Saturday night, after having been a Sunday afternoon race.
*The Subway Fresh Fit 600 at Phoenix International Raceway was moved to the second week of the season and returned to its previous distance, and is run during the day for the first time (the awarding of the second race date to Phoenix coincided with the installation of lights at the track and resulted in the race being run at night from its debut).
*Dover International Speedway maintained both of its Sprint Cup weekends and with the move of Chicagoland to the Chase, Dover&#x27;s Chase race moved back one week.

In addition to these developments, Las Vegas Motor Speedway bid for a second date for its track and failed to get it. Track management and ownership want to move the final races of the year from Homestead-Miami Speedway (Ford Championship Weekend) to Las Vegas as all three of the major series now hold their end-of-season awards banquets there.

===Nationwide Series===

*Nashville Superspeedway&#x27;s second date moved to late July and replaced the date held by Gateway International Raceway, which was closed by track owner Dover Motorsports following the 2010 racing season.
*Chicagoland Speedway gained a second Nationwide Series date, run on June 4.
*Iowa Speedway gained a second Nationwide Series date, run on May 22.
*Michigan International Speedway&#x27;s date moved to the weekend of the June Sprint Cup race.
*Circuit Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s date moved to the weekend of the August Sprint Cup race at Michigan.
*Auto Club Speedway&#x27;s fall date was removed from the schedule and not replaced by another track, condensing the schedule from 35 races in 2010 to 34 races in 2011.

===Camping World Truck Series===

*Phoenix International Raceway&#x27;s truck series date, which had been run near the end of the season for years, moved to February as part of the realignment of the Cup Series race.
*Darlington Raceway&#x27;s truck series date, which was run in August in 2010, moved to March.
*Kentucky Speedway gained a second truck series date, to be run on the same weekend as the July Nationwide Series event, and the track&#x27;s inaugural Cup race in early July. The track now hosts a triple header weekend, and the second race was moved to October.
*Kansas Speedway&#x27;s date moved to June as part of the Sprint Cup Series weekend.
*Michigan International Speedway&#x27;s date moved to the weekend of the August Sprint Cup race.

Although Atlanta has had major attendance issues in recent years, with less than 100,000 fans at the last two Kobalt Tools 500 races, its new Labor Day weekend race in 2009 was a huge success.

Kentucky Speedway has demanded a race for years, with its owners selling the track to Speedway Motorsports, Inc. and filing a lawsuit (which was dismissed) in efforts to get a Sprint Cup Series race. Improvements had to be made but were expected to be completed in time.

Chicagoland has had major attendance issues and its TV ratings have been some of the lowest of the season in recent years. NASCAR is hoping to save the race in a major market by moving it to the Chase. Some were worried about a conflict with the IndyCar Series, which had its race there during the Labor Day weekend. However, IndyCar officials did schedule realignment of their own eliminating the conflict altogether.

Kansas has also demanded a second race for years especially since the building of a casino near the track. Despite the closure of Nashville Superspeedway, which is owned by Dover International Speedway, Dover maintained two race dates.

Since the addition of the second race at Auto Club Speedway, attendance for both races has dropped considerably, even with a Chase race. Because NASCAR scheduled the first race at the track to immediately follow the Daytona 500 on the schedule, teams were forced to travel across the continent for the second week, hurting them financially and eventually leading to the discontinuation of the truck race there in 2010. The February race was also inconveniently scheduled on the same night as the Academy Awards ceremony (except in 2006 and 2010, when the ceremony was rescheduled to avoid conflict with the Winter Olympics), preventing major stars from appearing at the race. By returning the race to April, officials are once again hoping for a sellout.

Martinsville Speedway has also had attendance issues. However, it maintained two dates for 2011.

==Realignment 2012–2014==
NASCAR announced on September 29, 2011, that some schedule realigning would take place for the 2012 season. Although the realignment was not as drastic as past years, both of the Kansas races were affected. The spring race, which was added to the schedule for the 2011 campaign, was moved from June to April, and the spring race at Dover International Speedway returned to its traditional early June date. Kansas&#x27;s fall race, a part of the Chase for the Cup, was switched with Talladega&#x27;s Chase date and moved to late October. NASCAR said this realignment was due to a repaving project at the track which was scheduled to begin following the race.

In addition, the race at Kentucky Speedway moved to June preceding the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway.

Rockingham returned to NASCAR as part of the Truck Series and K&amp;N Pro Series.

The 2013 realignment did not see any significant changes, other than switching back the Talladega and Kansas Chase races to their original dates.

The 2014 realignment also had few changes. The dates were swapped for the spring races at Darlington and Kansas, turning Kansas&#x27;s spring race into a night race. The spring race at Texas Motor Speedway was moved from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon so as not to interfere with the NCAA Men&#x27;s Tournament, which began the same weekend in nearby AT&amp;T Stadium. Texas and Martinsville were moved up a week. The Darlington date moved to Texas&#x27;s original spot on the schedule. The Easter off-week moved to Kansas&#x27;s original date.

==Realignment 2015==
The 2015 alignment saw several drastic changes:
*Once again, Darlington was moved, this time returning to its original Labor Day weekend for the first time in 12 years. 
*The Food City 500, Bristol&#x27;s spring race, was moved to Darlington&#x27;s 2014 position on the schedule, in hopes of running it in warmer weather conditions as opposed to the cold and sometimes rainy conditions that had plagued the mid-March date. 
*Atlanta&#x27;s race was moved to the post-Daytona 500 date. 
*The spring Phoenix race was moved to what had been Bristol&#x27;s spring date. Because Las Vegas and Auto Club stayed in their original positions, the series now had an uninterrupted streak of three races on the West Coast, nicknamed the &quot;West Coast swing&quot;. This was done not only to please the fans, but it also meant that drivers and their teams would not have to make as many cross-country treks back to their shops in Charlotte.
*The off-weeks were relocated: the traditional Easter off-weekend now fell between Martinsville and Texas, and the summer off-week that originally took place between New Hampshire and the Brickyard 400 was repositioned to the week between Michigan&#x27;s Quicken Loans 400 and Sonoma&#x27;s Toyota/Save Mart 350. 
*Sonoma took Kentucky&#x27;s original date, and Kentucky took New Hampshire&#x27;s July date. New Hampshire&#x27;s summer date was moved to the original summer off-weekend. Due to 2015 being the first year of a new broadcasting contract between NASCAR, Fox and NBC, these changes to the summer schedule were done so that both networks started their coverage of the NASCAR season with a Daytona race, with FOX getting the Daytona 500 and NBC getting the Coke Zero 400. Additionally, for 2015 only, the Coke Zero 400 was run as a Sunday night race, since July 4 was on a Saturday when many NBC affiliate networks broadcast fireworks displays. 
*The season also received an additional off-weekend on the weekend prior to Labor Day weekend, making the regular season 40 weeks long (with three off-weekends and the off-weekend for the All-Star race). 
*The Chase dates at Charlotte and Kansas were flipped, with Charlotte becoming the opening race in the Contender Round of the Chase.

==Realignment 2016==
The 2016 alignment saw some changes to the schedule
*The Easter off-week is placed late-March between Fontana and Martinsville.
*The Coke Zero 400 at Daytona will return to its usual Saturday night date.
*Michigan and Bristol swap their August race dates.
*The third off-week was moved to mid-August between Watkins Glen and Bristol, instead of the late-August break between Bristol and Darlington. This was done to avoid a scheduling conflict with the 2016 Summer Olympics being hosted on NBC. The aforementioned Olympics conflict forced the race at Watkins Glen to be moved to USA Network
*The first race at Dover and the Memorial Day week swapped dates, so the last race before the All-Star Race was Dover instead of Kansas, because of Memorial Day being very late similar to 2011.

==Realignment 2017==
The final calendar for the 2017 season was released on May 5, 2016.

Key changes from 2016 include:
* The Daytona 500 was moved back a week.
* The Texas spring race was moved from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon.
* Dover&#x27;s spring race was moved back to the slot between the Coca-Cola 600 and the June Pocono race.
* Bristol and Michigan swapped back their August race dates.
* Talladega and Kansas swapped their October race dates, making Talladega the second race in the Round of 12 and turning Kansas into an elimination race.
* The summer off week moves back between Bristol and Darlington.
* The start times for several races, including the Daytona 500, were adjusted so as to have the event end during primetime.

==Realignment 2018==
The 2018 Cup Series season schedule was released on May 23, 2017, and saw some notable changes, which were how:

* The Advance Auto Parts Clash was moved back to Sunday afternoon (a week before the Daytona 500 after being held on the Saturday night before that for many years.
* The 60th running of the Daytona 500 would be moved one week earlier to be held on President&#x27;s Day weekend (in 2018, falling on Sunday, February 18), how it was until after 2011 and many years before that.
* Dover International Speedway&#x27;s spring race, was moved one month early to precede the KC Masterpiece 400 at Kansas Speedway and the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
* There was an additional off-week for the Cup Series in the schedule for 2018 on the Father&#x27;s Day weekend. That provided some flexibility for Fox so they could broadcast the U. S. Open and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The other off weekends remained being on Easter weekend (as it always has been) and in late-summer between the Bristol night race and the race at Darlington on Labor Day weekend.
* The race at Chicagoland was moved off of the playoffs and back to early in the summertime before the Coke Zero Sugar 400 (how it was like until after 2010). This change resulted in NBC&#x27;s portion of the TV schedule beginning at Chicago and not Daytona.
* The Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved to September to become the final race of the regular season after years of being in late July or early August.
* New Hampshire Motor Speedway&#x27;s fall race was eliminated and replaced with a new second race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, the South Point 400, replaced on the schedule and will be the playoffs opener.
* The Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond Raceway moved from being the final race of the regular season to the second race in the playoffs, replacing the New Hampshire/Las Vegas race, which was bumped back a week to become the first race of the playoffs.
* Charlotte Motor Speedway&#x27;s fall race moved a week earlier into late September from early October and for the first time utilized the track&#x27;s road course layout instead of its quad-oval, becoming the Bank of America Roval 400, and it also became the closing race to the Round of 16 in the playoffs.
* The fall race at Dover was moved one week later in the season to become the first race of the Round of 12 in the playoffs, flip-flopping places with Charlotte.

==Realignment 2020==
===Cup Series===
The 2020 schedule for the NASCAR Cup Series will undergo a series of significant changes.

*The Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway will move behind the West Coast swing to March 15, 2020, returning to its pre-2010 date of mid-March.
*The race at Homestead–Miami Speedway will no longer serve as the final race of the season ending a tradition that dated back to 2002 and bringing an end to Ford Championship Weekend. The race date will move to March 22, 2020, following the race at Atlanta, and become known as the Dixie Vodka 400.
*After 21 years of being NASCAR&#x27;s Fourth of July weekend event (and 60 of 61 years overall), the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona International Speedway will move to August and become the final race of NASCAR&#x27;s &quot;regular season&quot;. The Brickyard 400, run at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, will switch race weekends with Daytona.
*The Blu-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway will be run under the lights for the first time on May 9, Mother&#x27;s Day Weekend.
*Kansas Speedway&#x27;s spring race, the Super Start Batteries 400 that has been run under the lights on Mother&#x27;s Day Weekend will move from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon and be held on May 31, 2020, after the Coca-Cola 600.
*Both events at Pocono Raceway will be run on consecutive days the weekend of June 27–28.
*Dover International Speedway&#x27;s second date moves to late August, marking the first time the race has not been in NASCAR&#x27;s postseason. 
*The Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway and the Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway will both become Playoff races in place of Dover and Homestead. This will mark the first time since the inaugural Chase for the NEXTEL Cup in 2004 that Darlington will host a postseason event (that race was given to Texas in the Ferko lawsuit in 2005) and the first postseason race of any kind for Bristol.
*The Championship Round of the Playoffs will be conducted at Phoenix Raceway on November 8. This will be the first Phoenix race to close out the season. Due to this and the consolidation of the Pocono doubleheader, the 2020 season will actually end one week earlier than in the past. Usually the season finale is held on third weekend in November. Those dates being anywhere from November 16 to November 22.
*The Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond will move back to Sunday afternoon, similar to 2015-2017 when it was run on a Sunday afternoon. This was done because the two Martinsville Speedway races will be night races in 2020, as both races will start in the day and end at night.
*There will be two off weeks between Loudon and Michigan to accommodate the NBC networks coverage of the 2020 Summer Olympics, meaning the off week for the U.S. Open Golf Championship that Fox instituted will be removed. This prevents a conflict that happened at the 2016 Olympics, when NBC moved the Watkins Glen race to their USA Network. NBC&#x27;s half starts on the weekend of that golf championship.

===Xfinity Series===
* Atlanta will no longer be the second race of the season and moves a month later to become the fifth race of the season, and also the first race after the West Coast swing.
* The order of races in the West Coast swing changes, with the series now going to Auto Club Speedway (Fontana) before Phoenix Raceway (Phoenix) instead of the other way around as it had been in the past. Because there will be no race in between Daytona and the West Coast swing, Las Vegas will now be the second race of the season (instead of the third) and the flip-flop of California and Phoenix will be the third and fourth races. (Phoenix had been the fourth race previously and now is still the fourth race after this switch.)
* After being the season-finale for the Xfinity Series since 1995 and all three national series since 2002, Homestead-Miami Speedway lost its place as the last race of the season and will instead have its race in March between Atlanta and Texas on a weekend that had previously been an off weekend which will now be in April the week after Bristol.
* After previously having two races on the schedule, Richmond lost its spring date in favor of a race at Martinsville in October, which marks the series&#x27; first trip to the track in 14 years, when it hosted a race for one year in 2006 (in between when the series stopped going to Pikes Peak after 2005 and started going to Montreal in 2007). The race at Martinsville in October will be the second-to-last race of the season and the last race of the Round of 8 in the playoffs.
* After being held sometime in August every year it has been on the schedule, Mid-Ohio moves earlier in the season to become the first race held after Charlotte on Memorial Day weekend, replacing Pocono.
* Pocono&#x27;s race will be held on the last week of June, replacing Chicagoland. The race will be held on a Sunday afternoon instead of Saturday afternoon as part of the new &quot;doubleheader-weekend&quot; where the Cup Series will run both of their races at the track on the same weekend on consecutive days (on Saturday in addition to the Truck Series and Sunday in addition to the Xfinity Series).
* Chicago&#x27;s race moves a week earlier than it was in 2019. It now falls on Father&#x27;s Day weekend, which had previously been an off-weekend for the series, and that off-weekend was moved to July after the race at New Hampshire.
* After having hosted a night race on the Fourth of July weekend since 2002 in the Xfinity Series, Daytona&#x27;s summer race will now be in August, trading places with Indianapolis.
* Iowa&#x27;s second race moves back a week, on the weekend where Watkins Glen had been.
* After Mid-Ohio&#x27;s race moved back to late May/early June, Road America&#x27;s race moved into that weekend in August from where it had been previously later in the month.
* Watkins Glen moved two weeks later in place of the Bristol Night Race, which will now be a month later and part of the playoffs.
* Dover’s second race was knocked out of the playoffs and into the regular seasons as a result of Bristol being put in. That race at Dover will now be held on August 22 (the weekend where Road America had been).
* Since Labor Day falls later in the year in 2020, the race at Daytona (Indy in 2019) will now be held before Darlington instead of after so Darlington can remain on Labor Day weekend.
* The race at Richmond will now be earlier in September and become the last race before the start of the playoffs based on how the schedule works and Las Vegas Motor Speedway moves later in the month and into the playoffs.
* The Charlotte Roval race is now later in the fall and in October instead of September.
* After being the second-to-last race of the season for many years, Phoenix Raceway (Phoenix) will be the last race of the season after Homestead was bumped back to March. However, because of how the schedule works (only one off-weekend in the playoffs instead of two), it will remain on the same weekend in early November, and the season will end a week earlier than in the past.

Additionally, because of the schedule changes, Homestead and Mid-Ohio will now be Fox races and Pocono as well as the new Martinsville race will be NBC races. It will be the first time Fox has ever broadcast a NASCAR Xfinity race at Homestead. Mid-Ohio will mark Fox&#x27;s first broadcast of a road course race in the Xfinity Series since Mexico City in 2006 (which was under the old 2001-2006 TV contract).

===Truck Series===
* After being the season-finale for the Truck Series since 2002, Homestead–Miami Speedway lost its place as the last race of the season and will instead have its race in March between Atlanta and Texas 
* The Truck Series will return to Richmond Raceway for the first time since 2005
* Michigan International Speedway will serve as the final race of the regular season
* World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway will host the Playoff opener for the Gander Trucks 
* The Round of 10 will end at Bristol Motor Speedway
* The Round of 8 will end at Martinsville Speedway
* The Championship Round of the Playoffs will be conducted at Phoenix Raceway on November 6. This will be the first Phoenix race to close out the season

==2020 coronavirus pandemic changes==
===Cup Series===
*The Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway and the Dixie Vodka 400 at Homestead–Miami Speedway were originally announced on March 12, 2020, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to take place without fans in attendance, but one day later on March 13, 2020, NASCAR announced that the two Cup races (including support races) would be postponed.
* On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 have been postponed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
* On April 17, 2020, NASCAR announced that Martinsville Speedway race weekend on May 8–9 had been postponed, although the sanctioning body affirmed its commitment to running a full 36-race schedule.
* On April 30, 2020, NASCAR announced a revised schedule for the month of May, with two Cup races at Darlington Raceway and two points-paying races at Charlotte Motor Speedway, including the Coca-Cola 600 that will be run behind closed doors. The Charlotte races, however, began a new policy that track owner Sonic Automotive, parent of Speedway Motorsports, would implement at all events behind closed doors. Owners of condominiums and office space at the respective circuits were allowed to attend the races in their respective buildings, which at Charlotte meant spectators would be allowed in condominiums above Turn 1. Darlington&#x27;s newly added spring date would become permanent in 2021.
* On May 8, 2020, NASCAR announced that Sonoma Raceway and Chicagoland Speedway would not host Cup races in 2020, and that Richmond Raceway&#x27;s postponed spring date would not be rescheduled. Eventually, on September 29, 2020, NASCAR closed Chicagoland Speedway.
* On May 14, 2020, NASCAR announced another revised schedule, this time to show the races planned for the end of May through June 21. These tracks include Bristol Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, Homestead-Miami Speedway, and Talladega Superspeedway. NASCAR also announced a continuation of its empty stands policy for those races. As was the policy in Charlotte, spectators were allowed in Atlanta at the Turn 4 condominiums (a similar rule was used in INDYCAR at Texas for their Turn 2 units). NASCAR invited guests for Homestead, and began limited spectators at Talladega.
* With the exception of the Coca-Cola 600, all races starting with NASCAR&#x27;s return at Darlington through the Homestead race at minimum will feature no practice or qualifying. Teams will unload, have cars inspected, and race. The Coca-Cola 600 will feature qualifying only a few hours before the race but no practice.
* On July 8, NASCAR announced the next phase of revisions to the schedule through the conclusion of the regular season in August; this includes twin race weekends at Dover and Michigan (with the races shortened to 500 kilometers each), and the Go Bowling at The Glen being replaced by the Daytona Grand Prix — NASCAR&#x27;s first ever road course race at Daytona International Speedway. It was reported that the replacement of the Watkins Glen race was necessitated by travel restrictions imposed by the state of New York, which currently require 14 days self-isolation for anyone entering the state from areas designated as having large numbers of recent COVID-19 cases (including North Carolina, where the majority of NASCAR teams and staff are based). Fans may be admitted at events on a case-by-case basis depending on local health orders.

===Xfinity Series===
*The EchoPark 250 at Atlanta Motor Speedway and the United States Census Bureau 300 at Homestead–Miami Speedway were originally announced on March 12, 2020, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to take place without fans in attendance, but one day later on March 13, 2020, NASCAR announced that the two Cup races (including support races) would be postponed.
* On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 were postponed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
* On April 30, 2020, the sanctioning body announced an updated schedule for the month of May that included Xfinity races at Darlington Raceway and Charlotte Motor Speedway.
* On May 8, 2020, NASCAR announced that Chicagoland Speedway will not host an Xfinity Series race in 2020. A 2nd event at Darlington Raceway will replace the Chicagoland&#x27;s race. That will be the first time since 2004 that Darlington hosts 2 Xfinity Series events in the same year.
*On May 14, 2020, NASCAR announced that Iowa Speedway will not host an Xfinity Series race in 2020. A second event at Homestead-Miami Speedway will replace the first Iowa&#x27;s race. That will be the first time ever that Homestead hosts two Xfinity Series events in the same year.
* On May 27, 2020, it was announced that the rescheduled Bristol race, scheduled for Saturday, May 30, would be rescheduled again to Monday, June 1 as a result of the Cup race at Charlotte originally scheduled for May 27 being delayed by a day due to rain. The reason for moving the Xfinity Bristol race was because the Fox NASCAR TV equipment would not be set up and ready in time.
* The Dash 4 Cash races were supposed to be at Texas Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway and Dover International Speedway, but after all the COVID-19 schedule changes, they changed to Atlanta, Homestead, and Talladega with Bristol now serving as the qualification race for the Dash 4 Cash. Despite being in the middle of the races that do have it, the Saturday Homestead race will not be a Dash 4 Cash race.
* On July 8, 2020, NASCAR announced the series&#x27; schedule in the month of August. This included the move of the Watkins Glen race to the Daytona infield road course as a result of failing to get a waiver of Governor Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s 14 day quarantine rule for anyone entering the state of New York from states that are COVID-19 hot spots, which includes North Carolina, where NASCAR teams are based. In that announcement, it was also made official that the standalone race at Mid-Ohio race would be cancelled and replaced, and the same would go for the June Michigan race, which had been scheduled in June but when the Cup Series races became a doubleheader, the date clashed with Road America, despite being a standalone race. 
* On August 6, 2020, NASCAR announced that an additional race at Talladega would replace the cancelled Mid-Ohio race and will be part of the Xfinity Series playoffs. An additional race at Richmond would replace the cancelled Michigan event. In that announcement, it was also revealed that the Xfinity Series playoff opener has been moved to Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

===Truck Series===
* On March 12, 2020, it was announced that the Vet Tix/Camping World 200 at Atlanta Motor Speedway and the Baptist Health 200 at Homestead–Miami Speedway would take place without fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the following day, NASCAR announced that those races (along with the Cup and Xfinity races on those same weekends, also at Atlanta and Homestead) would be outright postponed instead.
* On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 would be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* On May 8, 2020, NASCAR announced that Chicagoland Speedway would not host their Truck race, the Camping World 225, for this season only as part of the COVID-19 schedule changes.
* On May 14, 2020, NASCAR announced that Iowa Speedway would not host a Truck race, the M&amp;M&#x27;s 200, for this season only as part of the COVID-19 schedule changes.
* On July 8, 2020, NASCAR announced the series&#x27; schedule in the month of August. This included the addition of a race at the Daytona infield road course which replaced the cancelled Iowa race. In that announcement, it was also made official that the standalone race at Eldora would be cancelled and replaced and the same would go for the Canadian Tire Motorsport Park playoff race. Gateway remained on the schedule despite being a standalone race. Additionally, because of the loss of these two races, the Gateway race became part of the regular season instead of the first race of the playoffs, and Kansas and Texas will be in the playoffs. 
* On August 6, 2020, NASCAR announced that a race at Darlington would replace the cancelled Canadian Tire Motorsports Motorsport Park race and will be part of the regular season. It marks the series’ first event at the historic track in more than nine years. A third race at Kansas would replace the cancelled Eldora event and will be part of the playoffs. In that announcement, it was also revealed that the series’ playoff opener has been moved to Bristol Motor Speedway.

In NASCAR&#x27;s first races back since the pandemic hit, there would be no practice or qualifying held so that teams would not need to bring additional crew members to the track and would not need to bring backup cars. (Crew members would be in contact with each other when repairing a primary car damaged in practice or qualifying or to prepare a backup car if a team had to utilize it). 

In the Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series and Xfinity Series races that will be held without practice and qualifying, NASCAR announced that the field size temporarily will be expanded to a maximum of 40 vehicles each. The field will be set by a random draw, similar to NASCAR Cup Series.

==Realignment 2021==
===Cup Series===
*The Busch Clash will be moved from the Sunday before the Daytona 500 to the Tuesday before (on February 9), in an effort to condense Speedweeks down to one week and also because of Super Bowl LV scheduling in nearby Tampa. The race will also be moved from the oval to the infield road course for the first time. The original intent of the change was a cost savings move to allow sixth-generation chassis for road course events to be used. NASCAR had intended to launch the new seventh-generation chassis from Technique at the Daytona 500, and with an insufficient number of chassis available, teams would use the sixth-generation chassis for the Daytona race. However, because of the pandemic, the release of the new chassis will be delayed to 2022, but the use of a road course chassis would save costs. For reference, there was one crash-related safety car at the Daytona road course round, while at the 2020 Busch Clash, four incidents occurred, each between 3 and 11 cars involved during the event, with only five cars finishing on the lead lap, and the winner, Erik Jones, doing so with a damaged car. The Daytona 500 will be held on Sunday, February 14.
*Phoenix Raceway will host Cup races on March 7 and November 7, the latter being the championship date.
*Nashville Superspeedway will host a Cup race, scheduled for Sunday, June 20 (Father&#x27;s Day). It will be the first time the speedway will host a NASCAR Cup Series event, and the first time the track has hosted any NASCAR events since 2011. In order to put the track on the schedule, its owner, Dover Motorsports, moved one of their two Cup races at Dover (a track which they also own) to Nashville.
*On September 29, it was reported that Kentucky Speedway and Chicagoland Speedway would not be on the 2021 schedule, 
*On September 30, NASCAR announced that Atlanta Motor Speedway would expand to two races, picking up the Quaker State 400 from Kentucky.
*On the same day, Road America was added back to the schedule for the first time since a Grand National race 65 years prior. The race is scheduled for July 4, replacing the race weekend at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
*With the release of the 2021 schedule, NASCAR announced that its race at Indianapolis would be run on the track&#x27;s road course configuration.
*The Cup Series will also race on dirt for the first time since 1970 as the spring race at Bristol Motor Speedway will have the concrete half-mile covered in dirt.
* The All-Star Weekend, traditionally held at Charlotte Motor Speedway, moves to Texas Motor Speedway and becomes the last race weekend telecast by NASCAR on Fox. The open weekend has its slot filled by a new race at Circuit of the Americas. As a consequence of gaining the All-Star race, Texas goes down to one points race.

===Xfinity Series===
* Circuit of the Americas (in Austin, Texas) is added for the first time.
* Nashville Superspeedway returns for the first time since 2011.
* Auto Club Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Iowa Speedway and Kentucky Speedway are removed from the schedule.
** Auto Club Speedway was initially on the schedule, but was replaced by an event at the Daytona Road Course due to COVID-19 regulations.
* Atlanta and Martinsville will go from hosting one race to two. This is the first time Atlanta has hosted two races, while Martinsville will host two races for the first time since 1994.
* Bristol and Dover will go from having two races on the schedule to one as the Bristol race will be the paved event. (The Xfinity Series will not race on the Bristol dirt weekend.)
* The Darlington (spring) and Talladega (fall) races added during COVID-19 schedule changes will be kept.
* The fall Texas and Kansas weekends swapped spots, with Texas being the Round of 8 opener and Kansas being the middle race.

===Truck Series===
There is one less race on the schedule, as it now contains 22 races instead of 23. This is also the first time since 2000 that the Truck Series has had more than one road course race (when Watkins Glen and Portland were on the schedule), and the first time since 1999 that there have been three road courses on the schedule (when it had those two races plus Topeka).

* Eldora Speedway, the series&#x27; original dirt race which had been on the schedule since 2013 (except for 2020 when it was removed due to COVID-19), was replaced by a race at Knoxville Raceway in Iowa, home of the Knoxville Nationals, which will be run on Friday, July 9.
* The series has two dirt races for the first time with the addition of a spring race at Bristol, which will see dirt temporarily put onto the track&#x27;s surface. The Cup Series will also be running with the Truck Series on that weekend. This race replaces the race at Kentucky Speedway, which will not host any NASCAR races in 2021.
* Circuit of the Americas replaces the spring race at Texas, as is the case with the Cup and Xfinity Series. This gives the series a second road course race.
* After a 20-year absence, Watkins Glen returns to the schedule for the first time since 2000, giving the series a third road course race. The race will be in August on the same weekend as the Cup and Xfinity races there. This race replaces the race at Michigan, which will not host a Truck race for the first time since 2001.
* Nashville Superspeedway is added to the schedule, replacing Dover, as is also the case with the Cup and Xfinity Series. This is the first race for the series at Nashville since 2011. The series will not race at Dover at all this season. It is the first time since 1999 where the track has not been on the schedule.
* Iowa Speedway is permanently taken off the schedule after its race on the 2020 schedule was removed as part of the COVID-19 schedule changes.
* Darlington Raceway, which was not originally on the 2020 schedule but added on as part of the COVID-19 schedule changes, becomes a permanent event for the first time since 2011. It will be run on Mother&#x27;s Day weekend along with the new second race dates for Cup and Xfinity at the track added this year. This race replaces the race at Chicagoland Speedway, which will not host any NASCAR races in 2021.
* Canadian Tire Motorsport Park was initially back on the schedule after being taken off of the 2020 schedule during the season as part of the COVID-19 schedule changes. Due to the continuance of Canadian restrictions, the race was moved to Darlington.
* Homestead-Miami Speedway is being removed in favor of the Daytona road course race. This was made for logistics reasons, as Homestead was moved back a week in order for Daytona&#x27;s road course to replace the Auto Club Speedway Cup and Xfinity weekend.

<text>In quantum physics, the Stern–Gerlach experiment demonstrated that the spatial orientation of angular momentum is quantized. Thus an atomic-scale system was shown to have intrinsically quantum properties. In the original experiment, silver atoms were sent through a spatially-varying magnetic field, which deflected them before they struck a detector screen, such as a glass slide. Particles with non-zero magnetic moment were deflected, owing to the magnetic field gradient, from a straight path. The screen revealed discrete points of accumulation, rather than a continuous distribution, owing to their quantized spin. Historically, this experiment was decisive in convincing physicists of the reality of angular-momentum quantization in all atomic-scale systems.

After its conception by Otto Stern in 1921, the experiment was first successfully conducted with Walther Gerlach in early 1922.

== Description ==

The Stern–Gerlach experiment involves sending silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field and observing their deflection. Silver atoms were evaporated using an electric furnace in a vacuum. Using thin slits, the atoms were guided into a flat beam and the beam sent through an inhomogeneous magnetic field before colliding with a metallic plate. The laws of classical physics predict that the collection of condensed silver atoms on the plate should form a thin solid line in the same shape as the original beam. However, the inhomogeneous magnetic field caused the beam to split in two separate directions, creating two lines on the metallic plate.

The results show that particles possess an intrinsic angular momentum that is closely analogous to the angular momentum of a classically spinning object, but that takes only certain quantized values. Another important result is that only one component of a particle&#x27;s spin can be measured at one time, meaning that the measurement of the spin along the z-axis destroys information about a particle&#x27;s spin along the x and y axis.

The experiment is normally conducted using electrically neutral particles such as silver atoms. This avoids the large deflection in the path of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field and allows spin-dependent effects to dominate.

If the particle is treated as a classical spinning magnetic dipole, it will precess in a magnetic field because of the torque that the magnetic field exerts on the dipole (see torque-induced precession). If it moves through a homogeneous magnetic field, the forces exerted on opposite ends of the dipole cancel each other out and the trajectory of the particle is unaffected. However, if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous then the force on one end of the dipole will be slightly greater than the opposing force on the other end, so that there is a net force which deflects the particle&#x27;s trajectory. If the particles were classical spinning objects, one would expect the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be random and continuous. Each particle would be deflected by an amount proportional to the dot product of its magnetic moment with the external field gradient, producing some density distribution on the detector screen. Instead, the particles passing through the Stern–Gerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount. This was a measurement of the quantum observable now known as spin angular momentum, which demonstrated possible outcomes of a measurement where the observable has a discrete set of values or point spectrum.

Although some discrete quantum phenomena, such as atomic spectra, were observed much earlier, the Stern–Gerlach experiment allowed scientists to directly observe separation between discrete quantum states for the first time.

Theoretically, quantum angular momentum &quot;of any kind&quot; has a discrete spectrum, which is sometimes briefly expressed as &quot;angular momentum is quantized&quot;.

=== Experiment using particles with +1/2 or −1/2 spin ===
If the experiment is conducted using charged particles like electrons, there will be a Lorentz force that tends to bend the trajectory in a circle. This force can be cancelled by an electric field of appropriate magnitude oriented transverse to the charged particle&#x27;s path.

Electrons are spin-1/2 particles. These have only two possible spin angular momentum values measured along any axis, formula_1 or formula_2, a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon. Because its value is always the same, it is regarded as an intrinsic property of electrons, and is sometimes known as &quot;intrinsic angular momentum&quot; (to distinguish it from orbital angular momentum, which can vary and depends on the presence of other particles). If one measures the spin along a vertical axis, electrons are described as &quot;spin up&quot; or &quot;spin down&quot;, based on the magnetic moment pointing up or down, respectively.

To mathematically describe the experiment with spin formula_3 particles, it is easiest to use Dirac&#x27;s bra–ket notation. As the particles pass through the Stern–Gerlach device, they are deflected either up or down, and observed by the detector which resolves to either spin up or spin down. These are described by the angular momentum quantum number formula_4, which can take on one of the two possible allowed values, either formula_1 or formula_2. The act of observing (measuring) the momentum along the formula_7 axis corresponds to the formula_7-axis angular momentum operator, often denoted formula_9. In mathematical terms, the initial state of the particles is
:formula_10
where constants formula_11 and formula_12 are complex numbers. This initial state spin can point in any direction. The squares of the absolute values 
formula_13 and formula_14 are respectively the probabilities for a system in the state formula_15 to be found in formula_16 and formula_17 after the measurement along formula_7 axis is made. The constants formula_11 and formula_12 must also be normalized in order that the probability of finding either one of the values be unity, that is we must ensure that formula_21. However, this information is not sufficient to determine the values of formula_11 and formula_12, because they are complex numbers. Therefore, the measurement yields only the squared magnitudes of the constants, which are interpreted as probabilities.

== Sequential experiments ==

If we link multiple Stern–Gerlach apparatuses (the rectangles containing &quot;S-G&quot;), we can clearly see that they do not act as simple selectors, i.e. filtering out particles with one of the states (pre-existing to the measurement) and blocking the others. Instead they alter the state by observing it (as in light polarization). In the figure below, x and z name the directions of the (inhomogenous) magnetic field, with the x-z-plane being orthogonal to the particle beam. In the three S-G systems shown below, the cross-hatched squares denote the blocking of a given output, i.e. each of the S-G systems with a blocker allows only particles with one of two states to enter the next S-G apparatus in the sequence.

=== Experiment 1 ===
The top illustration shows that when a second, identical, S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the first apparatus, only z+ is seen in the output of the second apparatus. This result is expected since all particles at this point are expected to have z+ spin, as only the z+ beam from the first apparatus entered the second apparatus.
=== Experiment 2 ===
The middle system shows what happens when a different S-G apparatus is placed at the exit of the z+ beam resulting of the first apparatus, the second apparatus measuring the deflection of the beams on the x axis instead of the z axis. The second apparatus produces x+ and x- outputs. Now classically we would expect to have one beam with the x characteristic oriented + and the z characteristic oriented +, and another with the x characteristic oriented - and the z characteristic oriented +.
=== Experiment 3 ===
The bottom system contradicts that expectation. The output of the third apparatus which measures the deflection on the z axis again shows an output of z- as well as z+. Given that the input to the second S-G apparatus consisted only of z+, it can be inferred that a S-G apparatus must be altering the states of the particles that pass through it. This experiment can be interpreted to exhibit the uncertainty principle: since the angular momentum cannot be measured on two perpendicular directions at the same time, the measurement of the angular momentum on the x direction destroys the previous determination of the angular momentum in the z direction. That&#x27;s why the third apparatus measures renewed z+ and z- beams like the x measurement really made a clean slate of the z+ output.

== History ==

The Stern–Gerlach experiment was conceived by Otto Stern in 1921 and performed by him and Walther Gerlach in Frankfurt in 1922. 
At the time of the experiment, the most prevalent model for describing the atom was the Bohr-Sommerfeld model, which described electrons as going around the positively charged nucleus only in certain discrete atomic orbitals or energy levels. Since the electron was quantized to be only in certain positions in space, the separation into distinct orbits was referred to as space quantization. The Stern–Gerlach experiment was meant to test the Bohr–Sommerfeld hypothesis that the direction of the angular momentum of a silver atom is quantized.
The experiment was first performed with an electromagnet that allowed the non-uniform magnetic field to be turned on gradually from a null value. When the field was null, the silver atoms were deposited as a single band on the detecting glass slide. When the field was made stronger, the middle of the band began to widen and eventually to split into two, so that the glass-slide image looked like a lip-print, with an opening in the middle, and closure at either end. In the middle, where the magnetic field was strong enough to split the beam into two, statistically half of the silver atoms had been deflected by the non-uniformity of the field.

Note that the experiment was performed several years before George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit formulated their hypothesis about the existence of electron spin in 1925. Even though the result of the Stern−Gerlach experiment has later turned out to be in agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics for a spin-1/2 particle, the experimental result was also consistent with the Bohr–Sommerfeld theory.

In 1927, T.E. Phipps and J.B. Taylor reproduced the effect using hydrogen atoms in their ground state, thereby eliminating any doubts that may have been caused by the use of silver atoms. However, in 1926 the non-relativistic scalar Schrödinger equation had incorrectly predicted the magnetic moment of hydrogen to be zero in its ground state. To correct this problem Wolfgang Pauli considered a spin-1/2 version of the Schrödinger equation using the 3 Pauli matrices which now bear his name, which was later shown by Paul Dirac in 1928 to be a consequence of his relativistic Dirac equation.

In the early 1930s Stern, together with Otto Robert Frisch and Immanuel Estermann improved the molecular beam apparatus sufficiently to measure the magnetic moment of the proton, a value nearly 2000 times smaller than the electron moment. In 1931, theoretical analysis by Gregory Breit and Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that this apparatus could be used to measure nuclear spin whenever the electronic configuration of the atom was known. The concept was applied by Rabi and Victor W. Cohen in 1934 to determine the formula_24 spin of sodium atoms.

In 1938 Rabi and coworkers inserted an oscillating magnetic field element into their apparatus, inventing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. By tuning the frequency of the oscillator to the frequency of the nuclear precessions they could selectively tune into each quantum level of the material under study. Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1944 for this work.

==Importance==

The Stern–Gerlach experiment was the first direct evidence of angular-momentum quantization in quantum mechanics, and it strongly influenced later developments in modern physics:

*In the decade that followed, scientists showed using similar techniques, that the nuclei of some atoms also have quantized angular momentum. It is the interaction of this nuclear angular momentum with the spin of the electron that is responsible for the hyperfine structure of the spectroscopic lines.
* Norman F. Ramsey later modified the Rabi apparatus to improve its sensitivity (using the separated oscillatory field method). In the early sixties, Ramsey, H. Mark Goldenberg, and Daniel Kleppner used a Stern–Gerlach system to produce a beam of polarized hydrogen as the source of energy for the hydrogen maser. This led to developing an extremely stable clock based on a hydrogen maser. From 1967 until 2019, the second was defined based on 9,192,631,770 Hz hyperfine transition of a cesium-133 atom; the atomic clock which is used to set this standard is an application of Ramsey&#x27;s work.
* The Stern–Gerlach experiment has become a prototype for &quot;quantum measurement&quot;, demonstrating the observation of a discrete value (&quot;eigenvalue)&quot; of a physical property, previously assumed to be continuous. Entering the Stern–Gerlach magnet, the direction of the silver atom&#x27;s magnetic moment is indefinite, but when the atom is registered at the screen, it is observed to be at either one spot or the other, and this outcome cannot be predicted in advance. Because the experiment illustrates the character of quantum measurements, &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot; use idealized Stern–Gerlach apparatuses to explain the basic mathematics of quantum theory.

<doc id="962172" wikidata="Q6806649" url="?curid=962172" title="Medicare card (Australia)">
<text>A Medicare card is a plastic card, the same size as a typical credit card, issued to Australian citizens and permanent residents and their families. The card or the Medicare number is required to be provided to enable the cardholder to receive a rebate of medical expenses under Australia&#x27;s Medicare system, as well as subsidised medications under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The card is usually green in colour, although interim cards are light blue and cards for Reciprocal Health Care Agreement visitors are light yellow. The cards are issued by a government agency called Services Australia.

All permanent residents of Australia are entitled to a Medicare card, except for those who are deemed to be not residing in Australia. Citizenship is not necessary to be eligible for a Medicare card. The card lists an individual as well as any members of his or her family he or she chooses to add who are also permanent residents and meet the Medicare definition of dependent. The card must be produced or the Medicare number provided if the Medicare rebate is paid directly to the doctor under the bulk billing system. The doctor can retain the Medicare number for use when the patient returns for another consultation. It is also necessary to provide a Medicare number (although not necessarily show the card) to gain access to the public hospital system to be treated at no cost as a public patient. For non-elective treatment (e.g. emergency), public hospitals will admit patients without a number or card and resolve Medicare eligibility issues after treatment.

==Use of the card==
Services Australia supplies Medicare cards and numbers. Almost every eligible person has a card: in June 2002 there were 20.4 million Medicare cardholders, and the Australian population was less than 20 million at the time (overseas Australian cardholders may still have a card).

The use of the card is relevant only to consultations with medical practitioners who have been issued with a Medicare provider number. Such access has been made subject to increasing requirements since the mid-1990s. The Medicare card is used for health care purposes only and cannot be used to track in a database a number of activities. It contains a name and number, and no visible photograph. Individuals are not legally required to have a Medicare card, to carry it with them, or to produce it on request.

The primary purpose of the Medicare card is to prove eligibility when seeking Australian Medicare-subsidised care from a medical practitioner or hospital. Legally, the card need not be produced and a Medicare number is sufficient.

Since 2002, a Medicare card has been required to be shown at a pharmacy when collecting Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medications. The pharmacy can retain the number for use when the cardholder returns with another prescription.

The Medicare card is used as a recognised form of ID in opening bank accounts or obtaining a driver&#x27;s license. On the ‘100 point scale’, on which 100 points of ID are required for proof of identity, a Medicare card generally counts for 30 points.

The Medicare card will also be required when accessing medical, hospital or pharmaceutical services in a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement.

==Rebates==
The Medicare scheme entitles most Australian residents to a rebate of medical and some other expenses paid for consultations with a medical practitioner who holds a current Medicare provider number. The medical practitioner will usually apply for, maintain and quote a provider number on their tax invoices. Without quoting a valid provider number, a practitioner&#x27;s patients will not be entitled to a rebate of their medical expenses.

A practitioner who is in breach of a contract with the Commonwealth may face a 12-year prohibition on access to a provider number. This means that a Medicare cardholder cannot obtain a rebate of expenses paid to a prohibited practitioner regardless of the practitioner&#x27;s registration at any (state) board or specialty for the period that the practitioner is without a provider number.

==Issue of Medicare cards==
Medicare cards are issued by Services Australia (until late 2005 known as the Health Insurance Commission or HIC) to individuals and their families. A maximum of five names can be included on a card. Families with more than five members will have additional names listed on additional cards, while retaining the same card number. Children are listed on their parent&#x27;s card – a family may be all on one card, or a child may be listed on one parent&#x27;s card, or both parents&#x27; cards, or even in some cases, alone on their own card if their name exceeds a specific number of letters. Children who are wards of the state will be listed on a card with the Department of Children&#x27;s Services as cardholder. Medicare cards may be used to show a relationship when parents have different surnames to their children.

Individual Medicare cards are generally only issued to people over 15. This is a Medicare Australia policy (not legislation) and there are exceptions for people at boarding schools or away from home. Significantly, this policy may detract from the right of a mature minor to gain confidential medical care. Using their family&#x27;s Medicare card (and presenting the card) could potentially notify their parents of the consultation, but only if the parents request information about their child&#x27;s medical claims and for a person to request information about medical claims for people 14 years and over they must have the permission of that person they are requesting the information for.

==Proposed Australia and Access Cards==
Several unsuccessful proposals have been made to expand the scope of use of the Medicare card, such as the Australia Card proposal. 

In 2005, plans to expand the functions of the Medicare card were announced by then Howard government Human Services Minister Joe Hockey. The new card, to be called the Access Card, was intended to replace both the Medicare and up to 17 other similar cards (such as Centrelink benefit and concession cards), and to commence operation in 2008. However, the scheme was criticised by some sectors of the public and relevant interest groups as a step in the same direction of an Australia Card. The Howard government was unable to implement the scheme before the government&#x27;s electoral defeat in 2007.

The incoming Labor government announced on 7 December 2007 that the Access Card scheme would be abandoned. The same aims were later achieved with &quot;myGov&quot; from 2013.

<doc id="962174" wikidata="Q924483" url="?curid=962174" title="Node of Ranvier">
<text>Nodes of Ranvier ( ), also known as myelin-sheath gaps, occur along a myelinated axon where the axolemma is exposed to the extracellular space. Nodes of Ranvier are uninsulated axonal domains that are highly enriched in sodium and potassium ion channels complexed with cell adhesion molecules, allowing them to participate in the exchange of ions required to regenerate the action potential. Nerve conduction in myelinated axons is referred to as saltatory conduction () due to the manner in which the action potential seems to &quot;jump&quot; from one node to the next along the axon. This results in faster conduction of the action potential. The nodes of Ranvier are present in both the peripheral and central nervous systems.

==Overview==

The nodes are primarily composed of sodium and potassium voltage-gated ion channels; CAMs such as neurofascin-186 and NrCAM; and cytoskeletal adaptor proteins such as ankyrin-G and spectrinβIV.
Many vertebrate axons are surrounded by a myelin sheath, allowing rapid and efficient saltatory (&quot;jumping&quot;) propagation of action potentials. The contacts between neurons and glial cells display a very high level of spatial and temporal organization in myelinated fibers. The myelinating glial cells - oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) - are wrapped around the axon, leaving the axolemma relatively uncovered at the regularly spaced nodes of Ranvier.

The internodal glial membranes are fused to form compact myelin, whereas the cytoplasm-filled paranodal loops of myelinating cells are spirally wrapped around the axon at both sides of the nodes. This organization demands a tight developmental control and the formation of a variety of specialized zones of contact between different areas of the myelinating cell membrane. Each node of Ranvier is flanked by paranodal regions where helicoidally wrapped glial loops are attached to the axonal membrane by a septate-like junction.

The segment between nodes of Ranvier is termed as the internode, and its outermost part that is in contact with paranodes is referred to as the juxtaparanodal region. The nodes are encapsulated by microvilli stemming from the outer aspect of the Schwann cell membrane in the PNS, or by perinodal extensions from astrocytes in the CNS.

==Structure==
The internodes are the myelin segments and the gaps between are referred to as nodes. The size and the spacing of the internodes vary with the fiber diameter in a curvilinear relationship that is optimized for maximal conduction velocity. The size of the nodes span from 1–2 μm whereas the internodes can be up to (and occasionally even greater than)1.5 millimetres long, depending on the axon diameter and fiber type.

The structure of the node and the flanking paranodal regions are distinct from the internodes under the compact myelin sheath, but are very similar in CNS and PNS. The axon is exposed to the extra-cellular environment at the node and is constricted in its diameter. The decreased axon size reflects a higher packing density of neurofilaments in this region, which are less heavily phosphorylated and are transported more slowly. Vesicles and other organelles are also increased at the nodes, which suggest that there is a bottleneck of axonal transport in both directions as well as local axonal-glial signaling.

When a longitudinal section is made through a myelinating Schwann cell at the node, three distinctive segments are represented: the stereotypic internode, the paranodal region, and the node itself. In the internodal region, the Schwann cell has an outer collar of cytoplasm, a compact myelin sheath, and inner collar of cytoplasm, and the axolemma. At the paranodal regions, the paranodal cytoplasm loops contact thickenings of the axolemma to form septate –like junctions. In the node alone, the axolemma is contacted by several Schwann microvilli and contains a dense cytoskeletal undercoating.

===Differences in the central and peripheral nervous systems===
Although freeze fracture studies have revealed that the nodal axolemma in both the CNS and PNS is enriched in intra-membranous particles (IMPs) compared to the internode, there are some structural differences reflecting their cellular constituents. In the PNS, specialized microvilli project from the outer collar of Schwann cells and come very close to nodal axolemma of large fibers. The projections of the Schwann cells are perpendicular to the node and are radiating from the central axons. However, in the CNS, one or more of the astrocytic processes come in close vicinity of the nodes. Researchers declare that these processes stem from multi-functional astrocytes, as opposed to from a population of astrocytes dedicated to contacting the node. On the other hand, in the PNS, the basal lamina that surrounds the Schwann cells is continuous across the node. A study suggests that in the CNS, nerve cells individually alter the size of the nodes to tune conduction speeds, leading node length to vary much more across different axons than within one.

===Composition===
The nodes of Ranvier Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and high density of voltage-gated Na+ channels that generate action potentials. A sodium channel consists of a pore-forming α subunit and two accessory β subunits, which anchor the channel to extra-cellular and intra-cellular components. The nodes of Ranvier in the central and peripheral nervous systems mostly consist of αNaV1.6 and β1 subunits. The extra-cellular region of β subunits can associate with itself and other proteins, such as tenascin R and the cell-adhesion molecules neurofascin and contactin. Contactin is also present at nodes in the CNS and interaction with this molecule enhances the surface expression of Na+ channels.

Ankyrin has been found to be bounded to βIV spectrin, a spectrin isoform enriched at nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments. The PNS nodes are surrounded by Schwann cell microvilli, which contain ERMs and EBP50 that may provide a connection to actin microfilaments. Several extracellular matrix proteins are enriched at nodes of Ranvier, including tenascin-R, Bral-1, and proteoglycan NG2, as well as phosphacan and versican V2. At CNS nodes, the axonal proteins also include contactin; however, different from the PNS, Schwann cell microvilli are replaced by astrocyte perinodal extensions.

===Molecular organization===
The molecular organization of the nodes corresponds to their specialized function in impulse propagation. The level of sodium channels in the node versus the internode suggests that the number IMPs corresponds to sodium channels. Potassium channels are essentially absent in the nodal axolemma, whereas they are highly concentrated in the paranodal axolemma and Schwann cell membranes at the node. The exact function of potassium channels have not quite been revealed, but it is known that they may contribute to the rapid repolarization of the action potentials or play a vital role in buffering the potassium ions at the nodes. This highly asymmetric distribution of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels is in striking contrast to their diffuse distribution in unmyelinated fibers.

The filamentous network subjacent to the nodal membrane contains cytoskeletal proteins called spectrin and ankyrin. The high density of ankyrin at the nodes may be functionally significant because several of the proteins that are populated at the nodes share the ability to bind to ankyrin with extremely high affinity. All of these proteins, including ankyrin, are enriched in the initial segment of axons which suggests a functional relationship. Now the relationship of these molecular components to the clustering of sodium channels at the nodes is still not known. Although some cell-adhesion molecules have been reported to be present at the nodes inconsistently; however, a variety of other molecules are known to be highly populated at the glial membranes of the paranodal regions where they contribute to its organization and structural integrity.

==Development==
===Myelination of nerve fibers===
The complex changes that the Schwann cell undergoes during the process of myelination of peripheral nerve fibers have been observed and studied by many. The initial envelopment of the axon occurs without interruption along the entire extent of the Schwann cell. This process is sequenced by the in-folding of the Schwann cell surface so that a double membrane of the opposing faces of the in-folded Schwann cell surface is formed. This membrane stretches and spirally wraps itself over and over as the in-folding of the Schwann cell surface continues. As a result, the increase in the thickness of the extension of the myelin sheath in its cross-sectional diameter is easily ascertained. It is also evident that each of the consecutive turns of the spiral increases in size along the length of the axon as the number of turns increase. However, it is not clear whether or not the increase in length of the myelin sheath can be accounted solely by the increase in length of axon covered by each successive turn of the spiral, as previously explained. 
At the junction of two Schwann cells along an axon, the directions of the lamellar overhang of the myelin endings are of opposite sense. This junction, adjacent of the Schwann cells, constitutes the region designated as the node of Ranvier.

===Early stages===
Researchers prove that in the developing CNS, Nav1.2 is initially expressed at all forming nodes of Ranvier. Upon maturation, nodal Nav1.2 is down-regulated and replaced by Nav1.6. Nav1.2 is also expressed during PNS node formation, which suggests that the switching of Nav-channel subtypes is a general phenomenon in the CNS and PNS. In this same investigation, it was shown that Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 colocalize at many nodes of Ranvier during early myelination. This also led to the suggestion that early clusters of Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 channels are destined to later become nodes of Ranvier. Neurofascin is also reported to be one of the first proteins to accumulate at newly forming nodes of Ranvier. They are also found to provide the nucleation site for attachment of ankyrin G, Nav channels, and other proteins. The recent identification of the Schwann cell microvilli protein gliomedin as the likely binding partner of axonal neurofascin brings forward substantial evidence for the importance of this protein in recruiting Nav channels to the nodes of Ranvier. Furthermore, &quot;Lambert et al.&quot; and &quot;Eshed et al.&quot; also indicates that neurofascin accumulates before Nav channels and is likely to have crucial roles in the earliest events associated with node of Ranvier formation. Thus, multiple mechanisms may exist and work synergistically to facilitate clustering of Nav channels at nodes of Ranvier.

===Nodal formation===
The first event appears to be the accumulation of cell adhesion molecules such as NF186 or NrCAM. The intra-cellular regions of these cell-adhesion molecules interact with ankyrin G, which serves as an anchor for sodium channels. In the PNS, this interaction has been elucidated. The Ig superfamily membrane protein NrCAM acts as a pioneer molecule in the formation of the nodes by recruiting ankyrin-G, a mediator protein in the connection of actin-spectrin cytoskeleton to the ion gated channels present at the node. At the same time, the periaxonal extension of the glial cell wraps around the axon, giving rise to the paranodal regions. This movement along the axon contributes significantly to the overall formation of the nodes of Ranvier by permitting heminodes formed at the edges of neighboring glial cells to fuse into complete nodes.
Septate-like junctions form at the paranodes with the enrichment of NF155 in glial paranodal loops. 

Immediately following the early differentiation of the nodal and paranodal regions, potassium channels, Caspr2 and TAG1 accumulate in the juxta-paranodal regions. This accumulation coincides directly with the formation of compact myelin. In mature nodal regions, interactions with the intracellular proteins appear vital for the stability of all nodal regions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes do not possess microvilli, but appear capable to initiate the clustering of some axonal proteins through secreted factors. The combined effects of such factors with the subsequent movements generated by the wrapping of oligodendrocyte periaxonal extension could account for the organization of CNS nodes of Ranvier.

==Function==

===Action potential===
An action potential is a spike of both positive and negative ionic discharge that travels along the membrane of a cell. The creation and conduction of action potentials represents a fundamental means of communication in the nervous system. Action potentials represent rapid reversals in voltage across the plasma membrane of axons. These rapid reversals are mediated by voltage-gated ion channels found in the plasma membrane. 
The action potential travels from one location in the cell to another, but ion flow across the membrane occurs only at the nodes of Ranvier. As a result, the action potential signal jumps along the axon, from node to node, rather than propagating smoothly, as they do in axons that lack a myelin sheath. The clustering of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels at the nodes permits this behavior.

===Saltatory conduction===
Since an axon can be unmyelinated or myelinated, the action potential has two methods to travel down the axon. These methods are referred to as continuous conduction for unmyelinated axons, and saltatory conduction for myelinated axons. Saltatory conduction is defined as an action potential moving in discrete jumps down a myelinated axon.

This process is outlined as the charge passively spreading to the next node of Ranvier to depolarize it to threshold which will then trigger an action potential in this region which will then passively spread to the next node and so on.

Saltatory conduction provides one advantage over conduction that occurs along an axon without myelin sheaths. This is that the increased speed afforded by this mode of conduction assures faster interaction between neurons. On the other hand, depending on the average firing rate of the neuron, calculations show that the energetic cost of maintaining the resting potential of oligodendrocytes can outweigh the energy savings of action potentials. So, axon myelination does not necessarily save energy.

==Formation regulation==

===Paranode regulation via mitochondria accumulation===
Mitochondria and other membranous organelles are normally enriched in the PNP region of peripheral myelinated axons, especially those large caliber axons. The actual physiological role of this accumulation and factors that regulate it are not understood; however, it is known that mitochondria are usually present in areas of the cell that expresses a high energy demand. In these same regions, they are also understood to contain growth cones, synaptic terminals, and sites of action potential initiation and regeneration, such as the nodes of Ranvier. In the synaptic terminals, mitochondria produce the ATP needed to mobilize vesicles for neurotransmission. In the nodes of Ranvier, mitochondria serve as an important role in impulse conduction by producing the ATP that is essential to maintain the activity of energy-demanding ion pumps. Supporting this fact, about five times more mitochondria are present in the PNP axoplasm of large peripheral axons than in the corresponding internodal regions of these fibers.

===Nodal regulation===
====Via αII-Spectrin====
Saltatory conduction in myelinated axons requires organization of the nodes of Ranvier, whereas voltage-gated sodium channels are highly populated. Studies show that αII-Spectrin, a component of the cytoskeleton is enriched at the nodes and paranodes at early stages and as the nodes mature, the expression of this molecule disappears. It is also proven that αII-Spectrin in the axonal cytoskeleton is absolutely vital for stabilizing sodium channel clusters and organizing the mature node of Ranvier.

====Possible regulation via the recognition molecule OMgp====
It has been shown previously that OMgp (oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein) clusters at nodes of Ranvier and may regulate paranodal architecture, node length and axonal sprouting at nodes. However, a follow-up study showed that the antibody used previously to identify OMgp at nodes crossreacts with another node-enriched component versican V2 and that OMgp is not required for the integrity of nodes and paranodes, arguing against the previously reported localization and proposed functions of OMgp at nodes.

==Clinical significance==

The proteins in these excitable domains of neuron when injured may result in cognitive disorders and various neuropathic ailments.

==History==
The myelin sheath of long nerves was discovered and named by German pathological anatomist Rudolf Virchow in 1854. French pathologist and anatomist Louis-Antoine Ranvier later discovered the nodes, or gaps, in the myelin sheath that now bear his name. Born in Lyon, Ranvier was one of the most prominent histologists of the late 19th century. Ranvier abandoned pathological studies in 1867 and became an assistant of physiologist Claude Bernard. He was the chairman of General Anatomy at the Collège de France in 1875.

Ranvier discovered the nodes in 1878. Using staining techniques developed by Ludwig Mauthner, he noticed that myelinated axons were only stained at regular intervals, leading to the discovery of the nodes. Reportedly, he dismissed the idea of nodes in the CNS although their existence was proven later.

His refined histological techniques and his work on both injured and normal nerve fibers became world-renowned. His observations on fiber nodes and the degeneration and regeneration of cut fibers had a great influence on Parisian neurology at the Salpêtrière. Soon afterwards, he discovered gaps in sheaths of nerve fibers, which were later called the Nodes of Ranvier. This discovery later led Ranvier to careful histological examination of myelin sheaths and Schwann cells.

<text>The Venus of Brassempouy (French: &quot;la Dame de Brassempouy&quot;, , meaning &quot;Lady of Brassempouy&quot;, or &quot;Dame à la Capuche&quot;, &quot;Lady with the Hood&quot;) is a fragmentary ivory figurine from the Upper Palaeolithic, apparently broken from a larger figure at some time unknown. It was discovered in a cave at Brassempouy, France in 1894. About 25,000 years old, it is one of the earliest known realistic representations of a human face.

==Discovery==
Brassempouy is a small village in the &quot;département&quot; of Landes in southwest France. Two caves near the village, 100 metres from each other, were among the first Paleolithic sites to be explored in France. They are known as the &quot;Galerie des Hyènes&quot; (Gallery of the Hyenas) and the &quot;Grotte du Pape&quot; (the &quot;Grotto of the Pope&quot;). The Venus of Brassempouy was discovered in the Grotto of the Pope in 1894, accompanied by at least eight other human figures. These may be an example of unfinished work, as if the artist or artists carved several figurines at the same time.
P. E. Dubalen first explored the &quot;Grotte du Pape&quot; during 1881, followed by J. de Laporterie and Édouard Piette (1827–1906) from 1894 onwards. Since archaeological excavation techniques were then only starting to be developed, they paid little attention to the stratigraphy of the site containing the remains. In 1892 the site was pillaged and disturbed almost beyond reconstruction by a field visit of amateurs from the &quot;Association française pour l’avancement de la science&quot;. Nevertheless, Piette described layers attributed to the late and middle Solutrean period. He termed the bottom levels he reached as &quot;éburnéen&quot; (pale or white like ivory), in reference to the copious amounts of ivory works which they contained. Modern reanalysis of the site has been performed under the direction of Henri Delporte during 1981–2000.

In 1894, one of those strata, recognized now as Gravettian, yielded several fragments of statuettes, including the &quot;Lady with the Hood&quot;. Piette considered the figures as closely related to the representations of animals of the Magdalenian period. He developed a hypothetical chronology that was later refuted by Henri Breuil.

==Description==
The Venus of Brassempouy was carved from mammoth ivory. According to archaeologist Paul Bahn the head is &quot;unsexed, although it is usually called a &#x27;Venus&#x27; or a &#x27;lady&#x27;&quot;. The head is 3.65 cm high, 2.2 cm deep and 1.9 cm wide. While the forehead, nose and brows are carved in relief, the mouth is absent. A vertical crack on the right side of the face is a consequence of the internal structure of the ivory. On the head is a checkerboard-like pattern formed by two series of shallow incisions at right angles to each other; it has been interpreted as a wig, a hood with geometric decoration, or simply a representation of hair styled in cornrows.

Randall White observed in the &quot;Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory&quot; (December 2006), &quot;The figurines emerged from the ground into a colonial intellectual and socio-political context nearly obsessed with matters of race.&quot; Although the style of representation is essentially realistic, the proportions of the head do not correspond exactly to any known human population of the present or past. White has claimed that, since the mid-twentieth century, concerns of interpretative questions have changed from race to womanhood and fertility.

==Date==
Although the head was discovered so early that its context could not be studied thoroughly, scholars agree that the Venus of Brassempouy belonged to an Upper Palaeolithic material culture, the Gravettian (29,000–22,000 BP). More precisely, they date the figurine to the Middle Gravettian period, with &quot;Noailles&quot; burins &quot;circa&quot; 26,000 to 24,000 BP. It is more or less contemporary with the other Palaeolithic Venus figurines, such as those of Lespugue, Dolní Věstonice, Willendorf, &quot;etc&quot;. Nonetheless, it is distinguished among the group by the realistic character of the representation.

Other broadly contemporary representations of female faces include the female face from Dolní Věstonice (), or the Venuses with faces of the Mal&#x27;ta Culture (Siberia, 24,000 BP).

==Display==

The Venus of Brassempouy is preserved in the Musée d&#x27;Archéologie Nationale at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris Since ivory is very susceptible to damage from factors such as temperature change, moisture, and light, the figure is not part of the Palaeolithic department, but is exhibited in the Salle Piette of the Museum, opened only by reservation.

At Brassempouy, a variety of objects excavated in the &quot;Grotte du Pape&quot; are on display at the &quot;Maison de la Dame&quot;. This exhibition space, devoted primarily to regional archaeology, also displays a fine set of casts of palaeolithic sculptures. These include the nine existing specimens from Brassempouy, but also casts of the well-known figures from Lespugue, Willendorf and Dolní Věstonice, as well as the Mal&#x27;ta Venuses, and the Grimaldi Venuses.

==Stamp==
In 1976, the Venus of Brassempouy was depicted on a 2 franc stamp. It has also been the motif of a 15 franc (CFA) stamp of the Republic of Mali.

<doc id="962185" wikidata="Q539521" url="?curid=962185" title="Michael C. Burgess">
<text>Michael Clifton Burgess (born December 23, 1950) is an American physician and politician who represented in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2025. The district is anchored in Denton County, a suburban county north of Dallas and Fort Worth. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Before his election, he practiced as a doctor of obstetrics and gynecology. In 2002, Burgess defeated Scott Armey, the son of House Majority Leader and then-U.S. Representative Dick Armey, in a primary runoff election. As a congressman, he was a member of the congressional Tea Party Caucus. Burgess has been involved in the debates over health care reform and energy policy. He opposes abortion, is unsure of the extent of the contribution of human activity to global warming, supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s restrictions on travel from Muslim-majority countries and refugee immigration, and supports the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

Burgess declined to seek a 12th term during the 2024 election cycle, and retired from Congress in 2025.

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Michael Burgess was born in Rochester, Minnesota, the son of Norma (née Crowhurst) and Harry Meredith Burgess; his paternal family emigrated from Nova Scotia, Canada. He graduated from North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) in 1972 and from the medical school at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in 1977. He completed a residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Over the course of his career, Burgess delivered over 3,000 babies. He is an Episcopalian.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Burgess, who had never held any public office entered the 2002 Republican primary election to replace House Majority Leader Dick Armey. His opponent was Armey&#x27;s son, Scott. The district, comprising almost all of Denton County (except a sliver in the southeast), was strongly Republican, and pundits predicted that whoever won the primary would not only win the general election, but be assured of at least a decade in Congress. Using the campaign slogan &quot;My dad is NOT Dick Armey&quot;, Burgess touted the support of medical Political Action Committees and organizations like the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Burgess took second place in the primary, with 23% of the vote to Armey&#x27;s 45%. Since neither candidate earned the required majority of votes, a runoff election ensued. Before the runoff, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; released a series of articles alleging that Armey used his influence as a judge to procure county jobs and contracts for his friends. The report hurt Armey&#x27;s campaign, and Burgess won the runoff with 55% of the vote. He won the general election with 75% of the vote.

Burgess&#x27;s vote shares include:
*66% in 2004
*60% in 2006
*60% in 2008
*67% in 2010
*68% in 2012
*nearly 84% in 2014 (for the first time, Burgess did not draw a Democratic challenger, and ran against nominal Libertarian opposition)

Burgess won his eighth term in the U.S. House in 2016. With 211,730 votes (66.4%), he defeated Democratic nominee Eric Mauck and Libertarian Mark Boler, who polled 94,507 (29.6%) and 12,843 (4%), respectively.

Burgess won a ninth term in 2018. With 185,268 votes (59.4%), he defeated Democratic nominee Linsey Fagan, who polled 121,584 (39%). Another 5,008 (1.6%) went to Boler, who also ran in 2016.

Burgess was elected to a tenth term in 2020. He received 261,963 votes to Democratic nominee Carol Iannuzzi&#x27;s 161,009 and Boler&#x27;s 9,243, winning the election with 60.6% of the vote to 37.3% and 2.1%, respectively.

===Tenure===

A member of the Republican Party and the Tea Party caucus, Burgess was considered a conservative member of the House. Through 2011, he had a lifetime rating of 93.59% from the American Conservative Union. Burgess signed Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

====Impeachment of Obama====
On August 9, 2011, Burgess met with a Tea Party group in Keller, Texas, to discuss his vote to raise the debt ceiling. When a constituent asked whether the House was considering impeaching President Barack Obama, Burgess responded, &quot;It needs to happen, and I agree with you it would tie things up ... No question about that.&quot;

====Abortion====
In 2013, Burgess voted for legislation to ban abortion after the 22nd week of pregnancy.

Burgess has been a staunch pro-life advocate over the course of his career.

====Immigration and refugees====
Burgess opposed the Obama administration&#x27;s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In 2010, he voted against the DREAM Act.

Burgess supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that Trump was &quot;well within his authority&quot; to issue the order and that &quot;Congress should remain involved in the process and provide legislation to strengthen not only border security but vetting those who wish to enter the country through any means.&quot;

Burgess sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.

====Health care====

Burgess was one of nine medical doctors in Congress, and one of seven in the House of Representatives. In May 2009, &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; wrote that Burgess had &quot;become a prominent voice on health care issues&quot; in the House. Since the 111th United States Congress, he has chaired the GOP Doctor’s Caucus, a group of 19 medical professionals in the House Republican Conference.

Burgess supports the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or Obamacare. At the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, he said he favored covering fewer Americans with health insurance. Burgess said, &quot;If the numbers drop, I would say that&#x27;s a good thing, because we&#x27;ve restored personal liberty in this country.&quot;

==== Energy and the environment ====

As a member of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Burgess has been active in the debate over energy policy. In 2011, he submitted an amendment to the 2012 Energy and Water Appropriations Act to defund part of the act that established higher efficiency standards for household light bulbs. Burgess&#x27;s claims that the standards represented a &quot;ban&quot; on conventional light bulbs were rated as &quot;Mostly False&quot; by the fact-checking website PolitiFact.com. On April 30, 2015, Burgess again introduced an amendment to the $35.4 billion fiscal 2016 energy and water spending bill that would defund the Department of Energy enforcement of incandescent light bulb efficiency standards, which passed 232–189, largely on party lines.

Burgess denies the scientific consensus on climate change. In a March 8, 2011, hearing before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the efforts of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases, Burgess said &quot;My opinion, for what it is worth, is that the science behind global temperature changes is not settled.&quot;

====Lowering the voting age====
In March 2019, Burgess was the lone Republican to vote to lower the voting age to 16.

====&quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;====
In December 2020, Burgess was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

==== Financial disclosures ====
In January 2022, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Burgess had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose a sale of stock in Cigna Corp.

====Iraq====
In June 2021, Burgess was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.

====Syria====
In 2023, Burgess was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

====Israel====
Burgess voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

===Legislation===
On February 25, 2014, Burgess introduced the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act (H.R. 4080; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize funding for public and private entities that provide trauma and emergency care services and for the administration of the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS).

* Committee on Budget

<text>Vodafone Libertel [[Besloten Vennootschap|B.V.]] is the second largest mobile phone company in the Netherlands, and was previously called Libertel. It is part of VodafoneZiggo, a joint venture between Ziggo and Vodafone Group.

It offers 2G GSM, 2.5G GPRS on the 900 MHz frequency band, 4G LTE on the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 1500 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz frequency bands, and 5G NR services via dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) with existing bands. It previously offered UMTS, HSDPA, and HSPA+  3G services (on the 2100 MHz frequency band) until their shutdown in February 2020.

Vodafone Netherlands currently has 5.2 million mobile customers. Vodafone Netherlands currently operates one subbrand using its network called &quot;hollandsnieuwe&quot; (launched in January 2011).

As of 2008, Vodafone Netherlands is based in Maastricht and Amsterdam and has around 2,800 employees.

==History==
Libertel was founded in September 1995 with financial backing from Nationale-Nederlanden (NN) to compete with KPN. Libertel was the second company in the Netherlands to get a license for offering GSM services (after PTT Telecom).

The corporate structure started with a holding partnership named &quot;CV Gemeenschapplijk Bezit Libertel&quot; containing three wholly owned subsidiaries: Libertel Groep B.V. (the holding company), Libertel B.V. (the cellular network operator), and Liberfone BV (the service provider).

The six original shareholders were ING, Vodafone, Vendex, Liof, Internatio-Müller, and Macintosh Retail Group. In early 1998, Vendex and Liof both sold their shares for 120 million guilders. Internatio-Müller and Macintosh each sold their shares for 48 million guilders. By the end of 1998, ING lowered its share from 52% to 30%, leaving Vodafone with 70%.

=== Vodafone acquisition ===
In June 1999, Libertel went public on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange as Libertel NV (ticker symbol: LTEL). Following the IPO, ING retained 5% (down from 30%) while Vodafone&#x27;s share of 70% remained unchanged. In 2000, Vodafone changed the brand name for Libertel to &quot;Libertel-Vodafone&quot;.

In 2002, Libertel-Vodafone was rebranded to &quot;Vodafone&quot; and saw major branding changes by the Vodafone Group. Other Vodafone subsidiaries also went through a similar transition, aiming to establish the first global mobile telecommunications company with a familiar &#x27;look and feel&#x27; throughout the world.

Vodafone Group performed a buyout in 2003 of the shares in Vodafone Libertel N.V. that it did not already own. At this time, Libertel was delisted from the Euronext Amsterdam stock market. in favour of Vodafone Libertel BV Dutch subsidiary Vodafone Group&#x27;s pre-existing Dutch.

On September 30, 2007, Vodafone Libertel changed its type of business entity type from NV to BV, henceforth trading as Vodafone Libertel BV.

In 2011, the Macintosh Retail Group sold BelCompany and Telefoonkopen.nl to Vodafone Netherlands for 120 million euro. By 2016, Vodafone had either closed or rebranded the BelCompany stores.

On 3 April 2012, Vodafone Libertel acquired Telespectrum Telecommunicatie B.V.

On 1 October 2015, Vodafone Libertel acquired mITE Systems B.V.

===Ziggo merger===
A merger was announced on 16 February 2016 with Ziggo. The European Commission approved the merger in August 2016, on the condition that Vodafone splits off its fixed-line internet business. The new parent company for both Ziggo and Vodafone, called VodafoneZiggo, with a 50/50 joint ownership by Ziggo and Vodafone, was created on 31 December 2016.

<text>Einstein&#x27;s Bridge is a hard science fiction novel by physicist and science fiction writer John G. Cramer.

==Publication history==
The novel was published in June 1997 by Avon Books. The hardback and trade paperback were followed by a mass-market paperback in 1998. The novel is out of print .

==Plot==
The plot revolves around three characters, George Griffin, Roger Coulton, and Alice Lang. Set between the years 1987 and 2004, the book details the efforts of physicists George and Roger as they work to bring the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) online in Waxahachie, Texas. Alice is a novelist who becomes involved with the pair while researching material for her new horror book at the SSC. She and George fall in love just as preliminary trial runs of the SSC produce an unexplained phenomenon: a &quot;Snark,&quot; to borrow an expression from Lewis Carroll, or an impossible event, in the form of a heavy particle which emerged from the planned head-on collision between two 20 TeV protons inside the SSC.

In addition to violating physical laws such as the conservation of mass, this particle emits pulses of radioactivity, spelling out the numerical prime number sequence of 2-3-5-7-11-13-17-19-23-29-31-37. Therein begins the unraveling of an even greater mystery than the particle: a powerful intelligence is behind this event, seeking to communicate with humankind, which has unwittingly announced itself to the universe through the powerful bursts of energy unleashed from the collisions of particles within the SSC. For a while, first contact is conducted by a benevolent species. A different species is also working to make contact—a &quot;less&quot; benevolent one, who may ultimately destroy the Earth and perhaps even the fabric of the universe.

The plot does not occur on our timeline but in an alternative history—one in which the Superconducting Super Collider was completed in Texas. In reality, the project was cancelled in 1993 and never implemented. In this alternate history, American forces invaded Baghdad and overthrew Saddam Hussein after liberating Kuwait during the Gulf War (1990-1991), leading to George H. W. Bush&#x27;s re-election in 1992 over Bill Clinton. The sinister significance of all this, and the relation of the alternative history to us, become clear in the end.

==Critical reception==
In reviewing the novel, &quot;SF Site&quot; said, &quot;Cramer weaves a compelling tale.&quot; Kirkus Reviews noted &quot;Cramer splendidly demonstrates just how fascinating and mind-boggling real science can be, and shows exactly how vulnerable basic research is to political whim.&quot;

<text>Thomas Jeffery Cole (born April 28, 1949) is the U.S. representative for , serving since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party and serves as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Before serving in the House of Representatives, he was the 26th secretary of state of Oklahoma from 1995 to 1999.

A member of the Chickasaw Nation, Cole is one of four Native Americans in Congress who are enrolled tribal members. The others are fellow Oklahoma Republicans Markwayne Mullin (Cherokee) and Josh Brecheen (Choctaw), and Democrat Sharice Davids of Kansas (HoChunk). In 2022, Cole became the longest-serving Native American in the history of Congress.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
Cole was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of John D. Cole and Helen Te Ata (née Gale); the latter was the first Native American elected to the Oklahoma Senate. They returned to Oklahoma, where family on both sides lived. His ancestors had been in the territory for five generations, and he was raised in Moore, halfway between Oklahoma City and Norman.

Cole graduated from Grinnell College in 1971 with a BA in history. His postgraduate degrees include an MA from Yale University (1974) and a PhD from the University of Oklahoma (1984), both in British history. Cole&#x27;s PhD thesis was &quot;Life and Labor in the Isle of Dogs: The Origins and Evolution of an East London Working-Class Community, 1800–1980&quot;. He did research abroad as a Thomas J. Watson Fellow and was a Fulbright Fellow (1977–78) at the University of London. He served as an assistant professor in history and politics in college before entering politics and winning political office.

==Early political career==
Following his mother, who served as a state representative and senator, Cole was elected to the Oklahoma Senate in 1988, serving until 1991. He chaired the Oklahoma Republican Party for much of the 1980s. He resigned from the state senate mid-term to accept an appointment as executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. From 1995 to 1999, he served as Oklahoma&#x27;s secretary of state, appointed by Governor Frank Keating. He assisted with the recovery efforts after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

Building on his involvement in national politics, Cole resigned from Keating&#x27;s administration when asked to become chief of staff to the Republican National Committee.

Cole spent two years working as a paid consultant for the United States Chamber of Commerce, but his primary effort in politics was as a political consultant for candidates. Along with partners Sharon Hargrave Caldwell and Deby Snodgrass, his firm (Cole, Hargrave, Snodgrass and Associates) played a large part in strengthening the Republican Party in Oklahoma. He backed a number of candidates who were elected to office during the Republican Revolution of 1994, when it gained dominance in the state. Among their clients have been Keating, J. C. Watts, Tom Coburn, Frank Lucas, Mary Fallin, Wes Watkins, Steve Largent, Chip Pickering, and Linda Lingle.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
During his initial campaign for the House of Representatives in 2002, Cole received the endorsement of Watts, the popular outgoing congressman. This helped him win the general election over Democratic nominee and former Oklahoma State Senator Darryl Roberts, with 53.8% of the vote to Roberts&#x27;s 46.1%. Cole has won at least 63% of the vote in each of his eight reelection campaigns, and he ran unopposed in 2010.

In 2024, Cole won the Republican primary against four challengers, including Paul Bondar, Nick Hankins, Andrew Hayes, and Rick Whitebear-Harris.

===Tenure===
Following the 2006 election cycle, the members of the House Republican Conference elected Cole to the post of NRCC chairman, placing him in charge of national efforts to assist Republican candidates for Congress.

Cole has established a solidly conservative voting record in the House. He has consistently voted anti-abortion and for gun rights. He holds pro-business views and supports free trade, the military, and veterans. Another one of his priorities is educating other members of Congress on American Indian issues. He favors loosening immigration restrictions and imposing stricter limits on campaign funds. In 2012, he sponsored H.R. 5912, which would prohibit public funds from being used for political party conventions. This legislation passed the House in September, but died in the Senate. During his tenure, Cole has been a leading voice for strengthening protections for Native American women under the Violence Against Women Act.

In June 2013, after another failure of the United States farm bill in Congress, Cole called the failure inexcusable. His district in Oklahoma includes some of the state&#x27;s farming communities, and if the Farm Bill passed, it would have saved $40 billion over a ten-year period.

As chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Cole was responsible for introducing the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4487; 113th Congress). The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, about the same amount it received in FY 2014. According to Cole, the bill meets its goals &quot;in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion.&quot;

In 2013, Cole introduced the Home School Equity Act for Tax Relief. The bill would allow some homeschool parents to take tax credits for purchasing classroom materials.

Cole expressed his intention in 2018 to push his Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act into the spending bill as an omnibus. The bill would &quot;make clear that the National Labor Relations Board has no jurisdiction over businesses owned and operated by an Indian tribe and located on tribal land.&quot;

The Lugar Center ranked Cole the ninety-first most bipartisan member of the House during the 114th United States Congress.

=== 2016 House speakership election ===
In the contest for House Speaker that followed the resignation of John Boehner, Cole supported the claims of Paul Ryan, saying:

&quot;Anyone who attacks Paul Ryan as being insufficiently conservative is either woefully misinformed or maliciously destructive. . . . Paul Ryan has played a major role in advancing the conservative cause and creating the Republican House majority. His critics are not true conservatives. They are radical populists who neither understand nor accept the institutions, procedures, and traditions that are the basis of constitutional governance.&quot;

===Political positions===

Cole supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.

In January 2021, Cole voted against the certification of the Electoral College results in the 2020 presidential election. He subsequently voluntarily gave up an honorary degree from Grinnell College. In May 2021, Cole voted against the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection.

In 2021, Cole joined a majority of Republican representatives in signing onto an &quot;amicus&quot; brief to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to overrule &quot;Roe&quot; in June 2022, Cole celebrated the outcome, saying in part &quot;not only is this a monumental win for states’ rights, but also the rights of unborn children.&quot;

Cole voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

====Iraq====
In June 2021, Cole was one of forty-nine House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.

====Big Tech====
In 2022, Cole was one of thirty-nine Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.

===Committee memberships===
* Committee on Appropriations (chair). He is the first Native American and the first Oklahoman to be chair of this committee.

=== Caucus membership ===

* Republican Study Committee

==Electoral history==

* In 2010, no Democrat or independent candidate filed to run in OK-4. The results printed here are from the Republican primary, where the election was decided.

==Personal life==
Cole and his wife, Ellen, have one son. Cole is a member of the United Methodist Church and lives in Moore.

Cole has said, &quot;I was raised to think of myself as Native American and, most importantly, as Chickasaw.&quot; Cole has said that a great-aunt of his was the Native American storyteller Te Ata. Describing his heritage, he said his &quot;mother Helen Cole was . . . extraordinarily proud of [their] Native American history and was, frankly, the first Native American woman ever elected to state senate in Oklahoma.&quot; She was the first Native American of any gender elected to the state senate in Oklahoma.

Cole sits on the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents and the National Fulbright Association. Cole is featured in the play &quot;Sliver of a Full Moon&quot; by Mary Kathryn Nagle for his role in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.

<text>Terry Wayne Norris (born June 17, 1967) is an American former boxer, prizefighter and a three time world champion in the light-middleweight (super-welterweight) division. Originally from Lubbock, Texas, he fought out of San Diego.

==Early years and amateur career==
A star baseball player during his high school years, Norris bypassed a career on the diamond for one in the ring, claiming an amateur record of 291–4, winning 4 Texas State Golden Gloves titles. Displaying a stunning combination of hand and foot speed as well as the ability to throw dizzying combos, Norris&#x27; athletic ability was an uncanny attribute in the ring.

==Professional boxing career==
Norris turned professional in August 1986. He outpointed future middleweight title holder Quincy Taylor in August 1988. Norris beat future super-middleweight champion Steve Little to win the vacant NABF light-middleweight title in December 1988, and defended it against former IBF title holder Buster Drayton. Norris also picked up two losses; a unanimous decision to Derrick Kelley, and a disqualification loss to Joe Walker in the first round after Norris hit Walker when Walker was down.

In July 1989 at Atlantic City Convention Center, New Jersey, Norris challenged Julian Jackson for the WBA light-middleweight title. Norris won the first round with his speed and movement, but a big right cross from the champion knocked Norris down in round two. Norris made it to his feet before the count but was deemed unfit to continue by referee Joe Cortez.

===First championship reign===

After winning three comeback fights, including a victory over former welterweight champion Jorge Vaca, Norris traveled to Tampa, Florida, in March 1990 to challenge John Mugabi for the WBC light-middleweight title. Norris wasted no time in stopping the champion, flooring him twice in the first round - the second time for the full count - and thus starting what would be the first of three reigns as champion.

After defending his belt against Rene Jacquot, Norris faced the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard in Madison Square Garden in February 1991. Norris scored two knockdowns and easily beat the faded Sugar Ray via a 12-round unanimous verdict. His next defense, a June victory over another former undisputed welterweight champion - Donald Curry - further cemented Norris&#x27; place in the history of the 154-lb division as Norris wore down his foe and knocked him out in the eighth.

Other prominent foes in that first reign included the tough future middleweight titlist Jorge Castro, and two reigning welterweight champions; WBA title-holder Meldrick Taylor, and IBF title-holder Maurice Blocker.

===Losing and regaining titles===

In a shocking upset in December, 1993, Simon Brown, former WBC and IBF welterweight titlist, knocked out Norris in four rounds to win the title and halt Norris&#x27; defense streak at ten. Ring magazine named this fight as their &quot;Upset of the Year&quot; for 1993. In their rematch, Norris then regained the title by unanimous decision over Brown in May 1994.

His second reign proved short when he lost the title by disqualification to Luis Santana in November, 1994. The decision to disqualify Norris was controversial. Norris hit Santana in the back of the head and Santana went down, claiming he was unable to continue. Some at ringside, however, felt that Santana refused to get up in order to gain the disqualification win. Because of the controversial nature of the match, a rematch was ordered. Norris also lost the April, 1995, rematch by disqualification, this time for hitting Santana after the bell had sounded to end the round. Norris was given yet another shot at regaining the title, and in their third fight in August of that year, Norris knocked out Santana in two rounds.

===Unification===

In December 1995 Norris won a unanimous decision over San Diego rival Paul Vaden to add Vaden&#x27;s IBF title to his WBC title, plus the vacant Lineal championship. Norris made defenses against former IBF champion Vincent Pettway, Nick Rupa, and Alex Rios, before being stripped of the IBF title in 1997.

Keith Mullings ended Norris&#x27;s championship career by way of ninth-round stoppage in December 1997, which also ended plans for superfights with WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya and with IBF Welterweight champion Felix Trinidad of Puerto Rico.

===Post-championship career===
Norris fought twice more after losing his title. Dana Rosenblatt defeated him by unanimous decision in a middleweight bout and then WBA junior middleweight champion Laurent Boudouani ended his boxing career with a ninth-round knockout.

Norris was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2005.

Norris suffers from pugilistic dementia and Parkinson&#x27;s disease caused by his boxing career . This affects his speech and coordination.

==Professional boxing record==

==Additional information==
* Once entertaining scholarships to several schools, Norris quit baseball after a brawl on the field. &quot;We were playing another team one day&quot;, Norris recalled, &quot;and there were some racial comments made toward me. I was a little thrown off by it. I rushed the guy who said them, and their whole team jumped on me. I put three guys in the hospital, which was the bad thing of it. People said things like, &#x27;Maybe this guy&#x27;s a troublemaker,&#x27; so a lot of my scholarships fell through.
* He settled a lawsuit out of court with Don King for a sum of $7.5 million in 2005.
* Brother of former WBA cruiserweight champion Orlin Norris.
* The speech of Terry Norris was noticeably slurred even in his early thirties and quite startling to anyone who remembered him from just a few years earlier. After his last defeat, the Nevada athletic commission turned him down for a new license, basing its decision on his impaired speech, which was indicative of his issues after boxing.
* Norris was known to spar 12 rounds every other day in preparation for fights. Some speculate that this intense training routine is a factor which may have ultimately led to his early expiration as a fighter.
* In preparation for his fight against John &quot;The Beast&quot; Mugabi, his strength trainer put Terry on a regimented weight training program. He went on to KO Mugabi and win the WBC super welterweight title. He continued his strength training for the duration of his career.
* A source close to the Norris camp is quoted as saying &quot;The best boxing I ever watched live was sparring between the Norris brothers.&quot;
* Norris is married to Tanya E. Norris
* Norris and his wife founded his Foundation The Final Fight to assist former pro boxers who are ill, broke and homeless.
* Norris and his wife own World Champion Cardio Boxing, a popular workout program in Los Angeles, California.

<text>The Mask of la Roche-Cotard, also known as the &quot;Mousterian Protofigurine&quot;, is an artifact dated to around 75,000 years ago, in the Mousterian period. It was found in 1975 in the entrance of a cave named La Roche-Cotard, territory of the commune of Langeais (Indre-et-Loire), on the banks of the river Loire.

The artifact, possibly created by Neanderthal humans, is a piece of flat flint that has been shaped in a way that seems to resemble the upper part of a face. A piece of bone pushed through a hole in the stone has been interpreted as a representation of eyes. Paul Bahn has suggested this &quot;mask&quot; is &quot;highly inconvenient&quot;, as &quot;It makes a nonsense of the view that clueless Neanderthals could only copy their cultural superiors the Cro-Magnons&quot;. Though this may represent an example of artistic expression in Neanderthal humans, some archaeologists question whether the artifact represents a face, and some suggest that it may be practical rather than artistic.

In 2023 the oldest known Neanderthal engravings were found in La Roche-Cotard cave which have been dated to more than 57,000 years ago.

<text>Penelope Anne Coelen (born 15 April 1940) is a South African former actress, model and beauty queen who won Miss World 1958. She was the second major international titleholder to come from Africa.

== Early life ==
Penelope Anne Coelen was from Durban, and attended Durban Girls&#x27; High School.

== Career ==
In the 1958 Miss World pageant, a total of 22 contestants from Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa competed in the finals. Europeans dominated the semi-finals, but Penelope Anne Coelen, an 18-year-old secretary who played piano in the talent competition, was selected for the crown.

She gained widespread international attention during her reign and received several lucrative modelling offers. The South African designer of her gowns, Bertha Pfister, also gained increased attention.

After her reign as Miss World 1958, she tried her luck out in Hollywood with the help of James Garner, but failed her screen test. She later managed her own line of clothing and endorsed beauty products, particularly perfumes. She appeared as a contestant on the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; on 25 November 1958. She celebrated the 2014 Miss World win of South Africa&#x27;s Rolene Strauss, and gave public appearances with the younger woman.

== Personal life ==
Coelen returned to South Africa, and married wealthy sugarcane farmer Michel &quot;Micky&quot; Rey from the Natal Province. They raised five sons. She ran a guesthouse, worked as a beauty consultant, and gave lectures. Her son Nicholas Rey died in 2016, twelve years after he was severely injured in a polo accident. The Nicholas Rey Foundation Trust, founded in 2007, is named in his memory. Her husband Micky Rey died in 2019.

<doc id="962250" wikidata="Q1475071" url="?curid=962250" title="Jon Hinson">
<text>Jon Clifton Hinson (March 16, 1942 – July 21, 1995) was an American politician who served as a Republican U.S. representative for Mississippi&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1979 to 1981. Following his 1981 resignation after his arrest for engaging in a homosexual act, he became an LGBTQ activist in metropolitan Washington D.C.

==Early life==
Born in Tylertown in Walthall County in southwestern Mississippi, Hinson attended public schools. In 1959, he worked as a page for Democratic U. S. representative John Bell Williams, who subsequently became governor of Mississippi in 1968.

Hinson graduated from the University of Mississippi at Oxford in 1964, and joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve, in which he served until 1970.

==Career==
Hinson worked on the U.S. House staff as a doorman in 1967, and then served on the staffs of representatives Charles H. Griffin, a Democrat, and Thad Cochran, a Republican. In 1978, Cochran ran successfully for the United States Senate, and Hinson was elected to succeed Cochran in the House. With 51.6 percent of the vote, Hinson defeated the Democrat John H. Stennis, the son of U.S. senator John C. Stennis, who finished with 26.4 percent of the vote. The remaining ballots were cast for independent candidates.

==Sexual orientation==
Prior to his 1978 candidacy for the U.S. House, Hinson survived a fire on October 24, 1977, at the Washington, D.C., Gay Cinema Follies. Firefighters found him under a pile of bodies; he was one of only four men rescued.

In 1980, Hinson admitted that in 1976, while an aide to Cochran, he had been arrested for committing an obscene act after he exposed himself to an undercover policeman at the Iwo Jima Memorial near Arlington National Cemetery. Hinson then denied that he was homosexual and blamed his problems on alcoholism. He also said that he had reformed and refused to yield to demands that he resign. He won re-election on November 4, 1980, with a plurality of 39.0 percent of the vote. The Independent Leslie B. McLemore polled 29.8 percent, and Democrat Britt Singletary received 29.4 percent.

Hinson, who was married, was arrested again on February 4, 1981, and charged with attempted sodomy for performing oral sex on a male employee of the Library of Congress in a restroom of the Longworth Building of the House of Representatives. After the investigation, which was prompted after complaints arose about similar incidents in the same restroom, Hinson was charged with sodomy.

At the time, homosexual acts, even between consenting adults, were a criminal offense. The charge was a felony that could have resulted in up to ten years in prison and fines of up to $10,000. Since both parties were consenting adults (and social attitudes were changing), the United States attorney&#x27;s office reduced the charge to a misdemeanor. Facing a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine, Hinson pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted sodomy the following day and was released without bail pending a trial scheduled for May 4, 1981. Soon thereafter, he checked himself into a District of Columbia–area hospital for professional care. Hinson later received a 30-day jail sentence, which was suspended, and a year&#x27;s probation, on condition that he continue counseling and treatment.

==Resignation and later life==
Hinson resigned on April 13, 1981, just three months into his second term in the House. He said that his resignation had been &quot;the most painful and difficult decision of my life.&quot; He was succeeded by Democrat Wayne Dowdy, who won the special election held in the summer of 1981.

After publicly acknowledging that he was gay, he became a gay rights activist, organizing lobbying groups and fighting against the ban on gays in the military. He lived the rest of his life in Alexandria, Virginia, and later Silver Spring, Maryland.

==Death==
Hinson died of respiratory failure resulting from AIDS in Silver Spring, Maryland, at the age of fifty-three.

Hinson&#x27;s body was cremated. His ashes were buried in his native Tylertown, Mississippi, after a private service. By then divorced from his wife Cynthia, Hinson was survived by a brother, Robert Hinson of Gulfport, Mississippi.

<doc id="962258" wikidata="Q681566" url="?curid=962258" title="Trenchless technology">
<text>Trenchless technology is a type of subsurface construction work that requires few trenches or no continuous trenches. It is a rapidly growing sector of the construction and civil engineering industry. It can be defined as &quot;a family of methods, materials, and equipment capable of being used for the installation of new or replacement or rehabilitation of existing underground infrastructure with minimal disruption to surface traffic, business, and other activities.&quot;

==Trenchless &amp; construction==
Trenchless construction includes such construction methods as tunneling, microtunneling (MTM), horizontal directional drilling (HDD) also known as directional boring, pipe ramming (PR), pipe jacking (PJ), moling, horizontal auger boring (HAB) and other methods for the installation of pipelines and cables below the ground with minimal excavation. Large diameter tunnels such as those constructed by a tunnel boring machine (TBM), and drilling and blasting techniques are larger versions of subsurface construction. The difference between trenchless and other subsurface construction techniques depends upon the size of the passage under construction.

The method requires considering soil characteristics and the loads applied to the surface. In cases where the soil is sandy, the water table is at shallow depth, or heavy loads like that of urban traffic are expected, the depth of excavation has to be such that the pressure of the load on the surface does not affect the bore, otherwise there is a danger of the surface caving in.

==Trenchless rehabilitation==

Trenchless rehabilitation includes such construction methods as spiral wound lining, sliplining, thermoformed pipe, pipe bursting, shotcrete, gunite, cured-in-place pipe (CIPP), grout-in-place pipe, mechanical spot repair, and other methods for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of existing buried pipes and structures without excavation, or at least with minimal excavation. Mechanical spot repair is applied where damaged pipelines require the reinstatement of structural integrity. Sliplining, CIPP, and thermoformed pipe lining involve pulling or inverting a new liner into an existing pipe, then applying heat and/or pressure to force the liner to expand to fill the pipe. CIPP technologies combine a carrier (felt or fibreglass) impregnated with heat, ultraviolet light, or ambient curable resin to form a &quot;pipe within a pipe&quot;. Pipe bursting fractures a pipe from the inside and forces the fragments outwards while a new pipe is drawn in to replace the old. The other methods are primarily for fixing spot leaks.
Trenchless rehabilitation methods are generally more cost-effective than traditional exhume (dig) and replace methods.

==Trade associations==
The trenchless technology industry is represented by several industry associations in addition to standing committees within almost every water and sewer related industry association. The International Society for Trenchless Technology, established in 1986, has 25 active national trenchless technology societies associated with it.

In the UK, the United Kingdom Society for Trenchless Technology (UKSTT) was established in 1993. UKSTT offers a Trenchless Enquiry Service to assist people in all area&#x27;s of trenchless technology.

In the US, The National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO) was established in 1976 and is the oldest such association with a trenchless focus. The North American Society for Trenchless Technology (NASTT) was established in 1990.

Several organizations bring out technical Journals for sensitizing the readers about such techniques.

<doc id="962265" wikidata="Q237267" url="?curid=962265" title="Kob">
<text>The kob (Kobus kob) is an antelope found across Central Africa and parts of West Africa and East Africa. Together with the closely related reedbucks, waterbucks, lechwe, Nile lechwe, and puku, it forms the Reduncinae tribe. Found along the northern savanna, it is often seen in Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda; Garamba and Virunga National Park, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as grassy floodplains of South Sudan.
Kob are found in wet areas (such as floodplains), where they eat grasses. Kob are diurnal, but inactive during the heat of the day. They live in groups of either females and calves or just males. These groups generally range from five to 40 animals.

Among the kobs of eastern Africa, the Ugandan kob (&quot;Kobus kob thomasi&quot;) appears on the coat of arms of Uganda, and white-eared kobs (&quot;Kobus kob leucotis&quot;), found in South Sudan, southwest Ethiopia, and extreme northeast Uganda, participate in large-scale migrations.

==Description==

The kob resembles the impala but is more heavily built. Males are more robust than females and have horns. Males have shoulder heights of and an average weight of . Females have shoulder heights of and weigh on average . The pelage of the kob is typically golden to reddish-brown overall, but with the throat patch, eye ring, and inner ear being white, and the forelegs being black at the front. Males get darker as they get older. Those of the white-eared kob (&quot;K. k. leucotis&quot;), which is found in the Sudd region (the easternmost part of their range), are strikingly different and overall dark, rather similar to the male Nile lechwe, though with a white throat and no pale patch from the nape to the shoulder. Both sexes have well-developed inguinal glands that secrete a yellow, waxy substance, as well as preorbital glands.

==Range==
The kob is currently found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Sudan, Togo, and Uganda. It was formerly also found in Gambia, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Morocco and Tanzania, but is now extinct in those areas.

==Ecology==

The kob&#x27;s distribution from western Africa to central East Africa is patchy. It inhabits flat areas and open country close to permanent water, with consistent climate. It drinks daily and requires fresh grazing. During the rains, kob frequent short grasses and keep them short. Since it is dependent on water, the kob does not wander far into arid areas. Kob gather on and move from one pasture to another, coinciding with seasonal changes. In flooded areas, they may travel hundreds of kilometers, and dry-season walks to water may take 10 km or more. Grasses preferred by kobs are &quot;Hyparrhenia&quot; species, &quot;Brachiaria brizantha&quot;, &quot;Setaria gayanus&quot;, &quot;Chloris gayana&quot;, and &quot;Echinochloa&quot; and &quot;Digitaria&quot; spp.

==Social behavior and life history==
Female kob can live in herds numbering in the thousands. They move more and are more social than territorial males. Females are at the front of the daily movements to water. Individuals learn where to go from their mothers. However, in larger herds, the females take their signals from other females. Males are also present in the migratory herds and follow the females. All-male herds may number in the hundreds and accompany females as they travel during dry season. 

The social and reproductive organization of kob can vary. When in average or low population densities, males establish conventional territories and do not travel much. Adult males try to establish their territories in the best habitat available, which are inhabited by herds of females and their young. Herds are fluid and change in size and structure as individuals travel to find green vegetation. Other males, particularly young males, live in bachelor herds and are segregated from the females by the territorial males. On floodplains, where kob are densely populated, around two-thirds of the territorial males establish traditional territories, while the rest live in clustered territories known as leks. These clusters are sometimes smaller than a single traditional territory. Lek clusters are located on patches of short grass or bare ground within comparably tall grassland. As such, these territories have little to no value other than to the males that reside in them. About eight or 9 of every 10 females visit leks to mate, trading spacing and food for mating success. The kob tends to live in smaller herds consisting of 5 to 15 individual kob, but herds as many as 40+ have been observed. Females and bachelor males live in large herds of up to 2000 and move through the leks, which are surrounded by high-quality grass and are near waterholes and commonly travelled routes.

Conflicts between territorial Ugandan kob (&quot;K. k. thomasi&quot;) are usually settled with ritual and rarely actual fighting, whether in conventional territories or leks. A male usually needs only to walk in an erect posture towards the intruder to displace him. Neighboring males in leks do the same thing when they encounter their borders. Lek-holding white-eared kobs fight more often. Ugandan kob do sometimes sustain serious or fatal injuries, especially when control of a territory is at stake. Fights usually involve the combatants clashing, pressing and twisting each other with their horns head-on. However, a neighbor may attack from the rear or side. In lek clusters, the most dominant males occupy the center. The number of males in the center of a lek cluster ranges from three to seven, and their leks are the most clustered and they monopolize copulations with estrous females. Replacement of males in leks are much more common than in traditional territories, and most males are able to stay in the centre positions for only a day or two and rarely up to a week. This is largely due to intense competition and because most males leave their territories to feed and drink. Centrally located males reduce their chances of being replaced by leaving to feed during periods of relative calmness, yet they are not able to get enough food and water and have to eventually leave their leks. However, a male can gain enough energy after a week or two, and try to take back his position. At every lek cluster, males are always waiting take or retake a central lek. Males in traditional territories are able to stay for at least a year or two.

Females have their first ovulation at 13–14 months of age and have 20- to 26-day intervals between estrous cycles until they are fertilized. Males from traditional territories and leks have different courtship strategies. Males of traditional territories will herd females and keep them in their territories. Lek males try to do the same, but usually fail. They have to rely on advertising themselves. Kob courtship may last as short as two minutes, and copulation may only last a few seconds. At leks, a female may mate up to 20 times with at least one of the central males in a day. After an eight-month gestation period and giving birth, estrus may commence 21–64 days later. For their first month, calves hide in dense vegetation. Mother and calf can identify each other by their noses. As they get older, calves gather into &quot;crèches&quot;. When they are three to four months old, the young enter the females&#x27; herds and stay with mothers until six to seven months, by which time they are weaned. When they mature, males join bachelors groups.

==Status==
Kob populations have been reduced by hunting and human development. The Ugandan kob (&quot;Kobus kob thomasi&quot;) became extinct in southwestern Kenya and northwestern Tanzania due to the expansion of human settlements and agriculture. However, there are sizeable populations of this subspecies in Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda and Garamba and Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Buffon&#x27;s kob (&quot;Kobus kob kob&quot;) is protected in several parks, including Niokolo-Koba in Senegal, Comoé in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Arly-Singou in Burkina Faso, Mole and Bui in Ghana, Pendjari in Benin, Waza, Bénoué and Faro National Parks of the North Province of Cameroon, Zakouma in Chad, and Manovo-Gounda-St. Floris and Dzanga Sangha Forest Reserve in the Central African Republic.

Once feared almost extinct because of the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005), surveys in 2007 and later confirmed that several hundred thousand white-eared kobs (&quot;Kobus kob leucotis&quot;) survived. Together with tiang and Mongalla gazelles, they participate in one of the largest mammal migrations on Earth, numbering about 1.2 million individuals in total. The white-eared kob is protected in Boma National Park and Bandingilo National Park in South Sudan, and Gambella National Park in Ethiopia.

<text>Jo Ann Davis (née Sides; June 29, 1950 – October 6, 2007) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007. A member of the Republican Party from Virginia, she represented the state&#x27;s . She was the second woman and first Republican woman elected to Congress from Virginia.

== Early life and education ==
Jo Ann Sides was born in Rowan County, North Carolina, but lived in Virginia starting when she was nine years old. She graduated from Kecoughtan High School in Hampton, Virginia. Davis attended Hampton Roads Business College.

==Political career ==
Davis worked in real estate before she was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1997. She was re-elected in 1999.

=== Congressional campaigns ===
In 2000, 1st District Representative Herbert H. Bateman, a 72-year-old incumbent, announced his retirement because of health concerns. He died on September 11, 2000. Davis ran for and won the Republican nomination to succeed him, despite Governor Jim Gilmore&#x27;s having endorsed her primary opponent; she beat out four other opponents in the primary. In November 2000, she received 58% of the vote to win the seat, defeating Democrat Lawrence A. Davies, and Independents Sharon A. Wood and Josh Billings.

She was the second Virginia woman (after Democrat Leslie Byrne who served one term from the neighboring from 1993 to 1995), and the first Virginia Republican woman elected to the House in her own right. The First is one of the more Republican-leaning districts in Virginia. No Democrat has won the district since 1977, and only the southwestern and the Shenandoah Valley-based are significantly more Republican, although the Southside-based is about as Republican and has never voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1948. Davis was reelected unopposed in 2002. She defeated Independent challenger William A. Lee in 2004. She won a fourth term in 2006 against token Democratic opposition, defeating Democrat Shawn M. O&#x27;Donnell and Independent Marvin F. Pixton III. Unlike Bateman, who was relatively moderate by Southern Republican standards, Davis was strongly conservative, especially on social issues.

=== Tenure ===

During her tenure, Davis secured $169 million (after authorizing $229 million) for construction on the Navy&#x27;s next-generation aircraft carrier, CVN-21, and $47 million for the removal of a portion of the James River Reserve Fleet, otherwise known as the Ghost Fleet. In 2002 she voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.

In March 2001, the House passed Davis&#x27;s first piece of legislation – HR 1015, the SGLI Adjustment Act , which increased the amount of Servicemembers&#x27; Group Life Insurance paid to beneficiaries of members of the Armed Forces who died in the performance of their duty between November 1, 2000, and April 1, 2001. She advocated tax cuts, and believed that the federal government must rein in growth and spending. She was the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Intelligence Policy.

=== Voting record ===
Davis was endorsed by several groups, including the Virginia Sheriff&#x27;s Association; the Peninsula Housing and Builders Association; the Virginia Society for Human Life; the NRA Political Victory Fund, and the Madison Project. She received a 93% rating from the National Federation of Independent Businesses for the 109th Congress, a grade of 95% from the Family Foundation of Virginia, and an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Virginia Political Preference Chart. Other ratings included a 0% from the National Education Association, a 23% from the League of Conservation Voters, a 0% from the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, and a 4% from the American Civil Liberties Union.

==Personal life==
Davis was one of four Pentecostals in the 109th Congress. The others were Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, Tim Johnson of Illinois, and Marilyn Musgrave of Colorado.

In 1974 she married Chuck Davis; the couple had two sons and were married for 33 years.

Davis was diagnosed in September 2005 with breast cancer and underwent a partial mastectomy on July 5, 2006, at the George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. The pathology report indicated that there was no further evidence of cancer, and Davis stated that she would return to work as usual. She attended House sessions until shortly before her death.

=== Death ===
Davis died on October 6, 2007, at her home in Gloucester, Virginia. She was reportedly recovering from a second bout with breast cancer, but her condition deteriorated rapidly over the week preceding her death. Davis was survived by her husband, Chuck Davis, two sons, and 2 grandchildren.

<text>Spiral Zone is a 1987 American science-fiction animated series produced by Atlantic/Kushner-Locke. Spiral Zone was animated by Japanese studio Visual 80 as well as South Korean studio AKOM. Based in part from a toy line made by Japanese company Bandai, the series focused on an international group of soldiers fighting to free the world from a scientist who controls much of the Earth&#x27;s surface. It only ran for one season, with a total count of 65 episodes.

Tonka acquired the license from Bandai and created a different treatment to the series, plus a short-lived toy line.

== Plot ==
In the year 2007, a brilliant but twisted military scientist named Dr. James Bent uses a neon military space shuttle to drop his deadly Zone Generators across half of the Earth, thus creating a region called the Spiral Zone due to its shape.

Millions of people are trapped in the dark mists of the Spiral Zone and transformed into &quot;Zoners&quot; with lifeless yellow eyes and strange red patches on their skin. Because they have no will to resist, Dr. James Bent - now known as Overlord - makes them his slave army and controls them from the Chrysler Building in New York City.

His followers are known as the Black Widows: Bandit, Duchess Dire, Razorback, Reaper, Crook, and Raw Meat. They are immune to the mind-altering effects of the Zone because of a special device called the Widow Maker. However, due to prolonged exposure to the Zone, they display the same physical effects to their bodies as normal people caught inside the Zone, which has dark skies and Zone spores growing in many places. Overlord seeks to conquer the world by bringing everyone under control with the Zone Generators. The Zones feed off human energy, which is why Overlord does not kill anyone inside.

With major cities Zoned, the nations of the world put aside their own differences to fight the Black Widows. However, only five soldiers using special suits to protect themselves from the Zone could do it. While easy to destroy, Zone Generators are impossible to capture because of booby traps. Overlord would also drop more generators on remaining military and civilian centers and force the Zone Riders into a standoff.

== Characters ==
===Black Widows===
Bent not only invented the Zone Generators but also an antidote process giving him immunity to the bacteria. He uses this process on his small group of soldiers. While immune to the mind-altering effects, each Black Widow still has lesions on their skin and have yellow dilated eyes.

* Overlord (Dr. James Bent; voiced by Neil Ross) - A commander and rebel scientist.
* Bandit (information unknown; voiced by Neil Ross) - A master of disguise, a terrorist of Middle Eastern origin.
* Duchess Dire (Ursula Dire; voiced by Mona Marshall) - A charming woman of British nationality, she is an assignment expert, hardened criminal, and Overlord&#x27;s mistress.
* Razorback (Al Krak; voiced by Frank Welker) -An aggressive loudmouth who specializes in bladed weapons.
* Reaper (Mathew Riles; voiced by Denny Delk) - A manhunter.
* Crook (Jean Duprey) - A French scientist who tricks Reaper into becoming immune to the spiral zone in the episode &quot; Shall You Reaper.&quot;
* Rawmeat (Richard Welt; voiced by Hal Rayle) - A truck driver who got tricked through Bandit in an episode called &quot; Bandit and the Smokies &quot;.

===Black Widow vehicles===
Overlord rides the &quot;Bullwhip Cannon,&quot; an eight-wheel all-terrain vehicle equipped with a large laser cannon. The other Black Widows ride &quot;Sledge Hammers,&quot; a one-man minitank that has triangular caterpillar tracks and has whirling mace arms on either side. They also have a special delta-winged aircraft called the &quot;Intruder.&quot;

===Zone Riders===
Overlord&#x27;s initial strike put all the major capitals of the world in the Zone. The chaos sparks international cooperation even between the United States and the Soviet Union. To counter the effects of the Zone bacteria, British scientists create a rare material called Neutron-90. However, only a limited amount of Neutron-90 is remaining in the world after the British government orders the destruction of the only laboratory where the material is produced. There is only enough material left to build combat suits for five specially-trained soldiers called the &quot;Spiral Force,&quot; also known as the &quot;Zone Riders.&quot;

* Colonel Dirk Courage (voiced by Dan Gilvezan) - Zone Riders leader, United States
* MSgt Tank Schmidt (voiced by Neil Ross) - heavy weapons specialist, West Germany
* Lt Hiro Taka (voiced by Michael Bell) - infiltration specialist, Japan
* 2nd Lt Max Jones (voiced by Hal Rayle) - special mission expert, United States 
* Cpl Katerina Anastacia (voiced by Mona Marshall) - medical officer, USSR

As the series advances, the Zone Riders discover that there is still enough Neutron-90 left over from assembling the five suits, sufficient to build two additional suits. They are issued to Australian demolition specialist Lt Ned Tucker and field scientist Lt Benjamin Davis Franklin.

===Zone Rider vehicles===
The Zone Riders are deployed around the world from a mountain base called the Mission Command Central, or MCC. Dirk Courage rides the &quot;Rimfire,&quot; a monowheel vehicle equipped with a large cannon on top. The other Zone Riders ride armored combat monocycles and wear special backpacks.

==Japanese version==

The suits and some of the vehicles in &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; originated from a line of action figures produced by Bandai that was sold from 1985 to 1988. Conceptualized by Gundam mecha designers Kunio Okawara and Kazuhisa Kondo, the &quot;Special Force Group Spiral Zone&quot; series depicted a team of special operations soldiers fighting a war in the early 21st century. The line only had 12 items, organized into &quot;Acts&quot;. They include: three 1:12 scale six-inch figures with full equipment codenamed &quot;Bull Solid&quot;, &quot;Hyper Boxer&quot;, and &quot;Sentinel Bear&quot;, two &quot;Bull Solid&quot; cloth uniform and armor sets, two &quot;Hyper Boxer&quot; cloth uniform and armor sets, two equipment backpacks, two bare human figures, and one vehicle called the &quot;Monoseed&quot;. The figures had 30 points of articulation.

Non-toy media included a notebook, a novel, and an LP/story compilation released in 1986 by Warner Bros. Records and Pioneer Corporation called a &quot;Hyper Image Album&quot;. The LP disc in particular contains songs composed by Toshiyuki Watanabe and performed by Tomoko Aran, with the accompanying stories written by Kazunori Itō. He wrote the novel with HEADGEAR colleague Akemi Takada as illustrator. The series&#x27; story and other machines, such as a mobile base and special transport for the Monoseeds, were also detailed in Bandai&#x27;s Model Making Journal.

Bandai had plans to release a fourth action figure (codenamed &quot;Fireball&quot;) and additional vehicles before the line was cancelled. They include a tank, a small flight pod called the &quot;Beaufighter&quot;, a radio-controlled assault jeep resembling the Chenowth DPV called the &quot;Fat Lynx&quot;, a fast-attack vehicle called the &quot;Mad Lemming&quot;, a bipedal mech, two personal transport backpacks, and the &quot;Monoseed Mk II&quot; assault cycle, among others. The &quot;Monoseed&quot; and &quot;Monoseed Mk II&quot; were the respective basis for the Zone Riders&#x27; standard motorcycles and Courage&#x27;s Rimfire Cannon, while one of the two unreleased backpacks, a monocycle called the &quot;Monodrive&quot;, was remodeled as Max Jones&#x27; &quot;Zone Runner&quot; backpack.

The unreleased vehicles later appeared in the series&#x27; gashapon line, which also had a special &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; super-deformed board game and other products not developed in 1:12 scale, such as new personal mecha units, weapon packs, and three figures (codenamed &quot;Zone Bolt&quot;, &quot;Eagle Eye&quot;, and &quot;Zone Acorn&quot;).

Because of their extensive detail and high-quality construction, the Japanese &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; figures are well regarded among toy collectors and often fetch high prices.

The American &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; animated series was dubbed into Japanese and aired on the satellite network NHK-BS2 in 1990. The episode order for the Japanese broadcast was substantially altered from the order used in the United States. For example, US episode #1 was aired in Japan as episode #3. However, the series&#x27; opening theme was left unaltered. The complete Japanese dubbed version of &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; was released on VHS format in Japan by NHK under their &quot;VOOK&quot; line in 1991 thru 1992.

==Releases==

===Toys===
Although best known for producing toys of construction vehicles, Tonka licensed the rights to &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; from Bandai and created a line of seven-inch figures that were later based on the animated series. The toy line, which hit the market in 1986, comprised four of the five original Zone Riders and all five original Black Widows, plus their vehicles, six cloth uniforms, and six equipment sets.

However, the cancellation of the series left the figures of Zone Riders Anastacia, Tucker, and Franklin, Black Widows Crook and Raw Meat, and a Zone Generator playset out of Tonka&#x27;s 1988 release. The figures were also highly detailed, but were not as articulated as the Japanese figures. Each figure has a special audio cassette tape.

===Home video===
Tonka first released &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; on VHS in 1987 with two episodes per tape. Only three tapes were produced before the series was cancelled. Tonka has not announced plans to release the series on DVD. However, an unofficial DVD set containing all 65 episodes and bonus materials was released in November 2006 by SpiralZone.com, with the cooperation of the show&#x27;s supervising director, Pierre de Celles. The site&#x27;s operator said that de Celles volunteered for the project by providing the original master tapes of the series, which were converted to DVD. He added that Tonka and parent firm Hasbro never responded to his offers to acquire the rights.

===Comics===
DC Comics released a &quot;Spiral Zone&quot; four-issue limited series in February 1987. It was written by Michael Fleisher with art by veteran artist Carmine Infantino.

==Production==
According to the show&#x27;s former supervising director Pierre De Celles, he wanted to get Spiral Zone to go for the fantastic science fiction direction, but the producers and sponsors discouraged him for doing anything too unusual.

<doc id="962277" wikidata="Q5583595" url="?curid=962277" title="Goods and services tax (Australia)">
<text>Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Australia is a value added tax of 10% on most goods and services sales, with some exemptions (such as for certain food, healthcare and housing items) and concessions (including qualifying long term accommodation which is taxed at an effective rate of 5.5%). GST is levied on most transactions in the production process, but is in many cases refunded to all parties in the chain of production other than the final consumer.

The tax was introduced by the Howard government and commenced on 1 July 2000, replacing the previous federal wholesale sales tax system and designed to phase out a number of various State and Territory Government taxes, duties and levies such as banking taxes and stamp duty.

A proposed increase of GST to 15% has been put forward, but is generally lacking in bipartisan support.

==Introduction of GST==
Les Bury, federal treasurer in the Gorton government from 1969 to 1971, was an early supporter of a broad-based national consumption tax, believing that states needed a revenue source of their own without resorting to a reintroduction of state income tax. The idea of a broad-based consumption tax was again raised by federal treasurer Paul Keating at the 1985 Tax Summit, but was dropped at the behest of then Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke after pressure from the ACTU, welfare groups and business, which did not like its association with proposals for capital gains and fringe benefits taxes.

The idea was revived in 1991 by the opposition Liberal-National Coalition led by John Hewson, and GST was the centrepiece of the opposition&#x27;s &quot;Fightback!&quot; platform at the 1993 election. The opposition had difficulty explaining the policy, as exemplified by Hewson&#x27;s famous Birthday Cake Interview, and Labor prime minister Paul Keating&#x27;s campaign exploited public distrust of GST, which was considered a factor in the opposition&#x27;s surprise loss of the &quot;unloseable&quot; 1993 election. In 1994, the Liberals decided to discard the remnants of &quot;Fightback!&quot; and Alexander Downer replaced Hewson as Liberal leader.

John Howard was re-elected leader of the Liberal party in 1995, and pledged &quot;never, ever&quot; to introduce GST. Howard led the Liberal-National Coalition to a large victory in the 1996 federal election. However, following a decision of the High Court that franchise fees charged by the states on cigarettes, alcohol and fuel was unconstitutional, removing revenue from the states and territories, Howard saw the need for the states to have autonomy on a portion of their revenue. Before the 1998 election, Howard proposed GST that would replace all existing sales taxes, as well as applying to all goods and services. At the election, the Howard government suffered a swing against it of 4.61% at the election, achieving a two-party-preferred vote of only 49.02%, compared with Labor on 50.98%. Nevertheless, the incumbent government retained a majority of seats in the lower house and Howard described the election win as a &quot;mandate for GST&quot;. Lacking a Senate majority, and with Labor opposed to the introduction of GST, the government turned to the minor parties such as the Australian Democrats to gain the necessary support to get the necessary legislation through the Senate.

A prominent selling point of the legislation was that all the revenue raised by GST would be distributed to the states. In 1999, an agreement was reached with the state and territory governments that their various duties, levies and taxes on consumption would be removed over time, with the consequent budget shortfall being replaced by GST income distributed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Furthermore, federally levied personal income tax and company tax was reduced to offset GST.

During the 1998 election campaign, the leader of the Australian Democrats, Meg Lees, stated that her party was opposed to GST unless food, books and tourism packages sold offshore were exempt, and other compensating tax measures were implemented. The government initially stated that exemptions to GST were not possible, and looked most likely to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Brian Harradine but Harradine ultimately voted against the legislation. However a compromise was eventually reached with Lees, involving most basic food items being exempt from GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime. A proposal to exempt tampons from GST was dismissed by Howard. The legislation was passed on 28 June 1999 as &quot;A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act (Cth) 1999&quot;. It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000.

In October 2018, State and Federal Governments agreed to remove tampons from the GST.

==Legal framework==
All Australian businesses whose turnover is above the minimum threshold (currently $75,000 per annum) are required to register for GST. Businesses whose turnover is below the threshold may register if they wish to.

A GST-registered business must charge its customers GST on taxable goods and services it provides, but is entitled to a credit for any GST it has paid for its expenditures on these goods and services as well as capital purchases (called input tax credits). A registered business must periodically lodge Business Activity Statements (monthly, quarterly or annually), and at the same time pay the net amount of GST owed to the tax office (if more GST is paid than collected, a refund is paid by the tax office instead).

Some goods and services (notably salaries, wages, fresh food, and real estate) are exempt from GST. Other goods and services (rental income and financial services) are &quot;input-taxed&quot;, which means that GST is not charged on the sale, but GST paid by that part of the business is not eligible to be claimed as an input tax credit.

Division 9 of the &quot;A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act&quot; 1999 (Cth) (GST Act) stipulates that GST is applicable to a supply of goods, services and transactions related to real property, obligations or rights. The supply must be for consideration (GST Act s9-15) to a relevant entity registered for GST (Div 23) in the course of enterprise (s9-20). This does not include employment or hobby income.

Products made entirely in Australia, as well as supplies going to or from Australia, are all taxable. Certain types of supplies are free of GST, examples include fresh unprocessed food, medical services, education courses, childcare, exports, pre-owned real estate and going concerns. When an enterprise purchases goods or services to be consumed or used for resupply to an end customer they may receive a refund (input tax credit) on the amount of GST contained in the price (Div 11), which means in effect no GST is paid on those supplies.

New residential and commercial properties are subject to GST but re-sale of existing properties is not. All real estate agent fees on either new or second-hand property are subject to GST. Processed foods such as biscuits, soft drinks, restaurant meals and take-away foods are also subject to GST.

Registered enterprises for GST must complete a Business Activity Statement (BAS) for reporting to the Australian Taxation Office on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis (depending on revenue and main activity).

==Effects==
===Political consequences===

John Howard had said that &quot;GST would never become part of Liberal Party policy&quot;, but his change of heart would become apparent in the lead-up to the 1998 campaign. It was passed by the Senate in June 1999 in a heavily amended form. The Leader of the Democrats, Meg Lees, viewed the dilution of the GST legislation as a success, but the issue split the Democrats, with Senators Natasha Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett voting against GST. The move triggered infighting amongst the Democrats, and while the Democrats performed reasonably well in the 2001 federal election when Stott Despoja was party leader, the infighting worsened, resulting in Stott Despoja being forced out of the leadership and the loss, at the 2004 federal election, of the balance of power they once held in the Senate. The annihilation of the Democrats was completed at the following election in 2007 when they lost all their remaining seats, with the Australian Greens becoming the major third party.

Australian Labor Party leader Kim Beazley continued to oppose it during the Howard government&#x27;s second term. During the 2001 election campaign, Labor made a &#x27;GST rollback&#x27; a centrepiece of its election platform. Labor attempted to reprise the effects of the birthday cake interview by deriding the application of GST to cooked and uncooked chickens, but failed to ignite public response to the limited scope of the rollbacks applying only to gas and electricity bills. Labor lost the election, and though the September 11 attacks and the so-called Tampa affair dominated the campaign, the loss would effectively end all serious opposition to GST.

In early 2006, the New South Wales State Government and the Federal Treasurer Peter Costello launched adversarial advertising campaigns concerning distribution of GST revenues to the states. New South Wales treasurer Michael Costa argued in full-page newspaper advertisements and on televised commercials that New South Wales consumers paid A$13 billion in GST but received only A$10 billion back from the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and therefore New South Wales was subsidising resource rich states like Queensland and Western Australia.
A bill was introduced that gave the federal government no obligation to hand back revenue earned by that state to be divided to other non-performing states. Unlike GST, sales tax revenue went back to the State that generated the sales tax.

The federal government counteracted with its own advertising campaign which claimed that New South Wales had breached its contractual obligations under the 1999 GST Agreement by continuing to charge unfair stamp duties and land taxes, which were supposed to have been abolished. After weeks of intense media and public pressure, the New South Wales State Government announced in its budget that it would reduce stamp duty and land tax, but critics argued that the State Government did not go far enough with much broader tax reform in New South Wales required to help encourage investment and business that had been forced elsewhere due to an unfavourable New South Wales business environment. This was in response to the Commonwealth allowing another A$72 million in grants to New South Wales, in addition to existing annual increases.

In 2015, Mike Baird, Liberal premier of New South Wales at the time, supported calls for increasing the GST to 15%.

In 2016 Jay Weatherill, Labor Premier of South Australia, supported calls for increasing GST to 15%.

===Economic and social effects===
Critics have argued that the GST is a regressive tax, which has a more pronounced effect on lower income earners, meaning that the tax consumes a higher proportion of their income, compared to those earning large incomes. However, due to the corresponding reductions in personal income taxes, state banking taxes, federal wholesale taxes and some fuel taxes that were implemented when the GST was introduced, former treasurer Peter Costello claimed that people were effectively paying no extra tax. Others also point out that the more important question to ask is not whether GST is regressive, but whether GST is more regressive than the alternative indirect taxes, namely, sales, excise and turnover tax (not income tax because that is a direct tax). In addition, they argue that what affects poverty and fairness is not the burden of any particular tax, but the burden of the tax structure as a whole, and how tax revenues are redistributed. When GST is combined with progressive taxes, and the revenues distributed to the poor, the total fiscal structure can be progressive.

The preceding months before the GST became active saw a spike in consumption as consumers rushed to purchase goods that they perceived would be substantially more expensive with the GST. Once the tax came into effect, consumer consumption and economic growth declined such that by the first fiscal quarter of 2001, the Australian economy recorded negative economic growth for the first time in more than 10 years. Consumption soon returned to normal however. The Government was criticised by small business owners over the increased administrative responsibilities of submitting Business Activity Statements (BAS) on a quarterly basis to the Australian Taxation Office.

A study commissioned by the Curtin University of Technology, Perth in 2000 argued that the introduction of the GST would negatively affect the real estate market as it would add up to 8 percent to the cost of new homes and reduce demand by about 12 percent. The real estate market returned to boom between 2002 and 2004 where property prices and demand increased dramatically, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. During the 2004–06 period Perth also witnessed a sharp climb in real estate prices and demand.

===Tourist refund scheme===
Before the introduction of the GST, goods could be purchased from suppliers offering duty-free pricing upon presentation of a current passport and airline tickets. The goods would then remain sealed until the passenger had passed through the customs area at an airport.

Following the introduction of the GST, a receipt for goods with a combined total over A$300 is eligible for a refund of any GST paid upon exiting the country with refunds claimed at a TRS (Tourist Refund Scheme) counter at the airport. The advantage of this arrangement is that goods purchased 60 days prior to departure may be freely used within Australia prior departure as long as they are carried in hand luggage and presented when making a refund claim, or shown to customs officials before being checked in as baggage. This does not extend to consumable goods such as food and beverages, or any services such as plane tickets or hotel room charges.
To claim the Tourist Refund Scheme you have to follow the given rules:

* You have to spend $300 or more including the GST on a single platform. You are allowed to combine all the invoices from the same retailer
* The goods that you bought must be available in your baggage or carry-on so they can be checked
* The original tax invoice of the good must be available. If there is a tax invoice that exceeds the amount of $1000 must have your address on it
* You should have paid for all the items yourself.

<doc id="962284" wikidata="Q1344200" url="?curid=962284" title="Mike Doyle (American politician)">
<text>Michael F. Doyle Jr. (born August 5, 1953) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for , serving from 1995 to 2022. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district was based in Pittsburgh and included most of Allegheny County.

A native of Swissvale and graduate of the Pennsylvania State University, Doyle previously served as a member of the Swissvale Borough Council (1977–1981) and an aide to Republican State Senator Frank Pecora (1979–1994). He was first elected to Congress in 1994. Doyle announced that he would retire from Congress in 2022.

==Early life, education and career==
Doyle was born in Swissvale, Pennsylvania, to Michael F. and Rosemarie Fusco Doyle. He graduated from Swissvale Area High School in 1971, and then enrolled at Pennsylvania State University. He worked in steel mills during his summers in college, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in community development in 1975.

After college, Doyle worked as executive director of Turtle Creek Valley Citizens Union (1977–1979) and was elected to the Swissvale Borough Council in 1977. In 1979, he began work as chief of staff to Pennsylvania State Senator Frank Pecora. Like Pecora, Doyle was once a Republican who later switched parties to become a Democrat. In addition to his work for Pecora, he joined Eastgate Insurance Company as an insurance agent in 1982.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== Elections ===
In 1994, Doyle was elected to Congress as a Democrat from the state&#x27;s 18th district, which at the time was in Pittsburgh&#x27;s eastern suburbs. The incumbent Republican, Rick Santorum, was elected to the United States Senate. Doyle won by almost 10 points, in one of the few bright spots in a bad year for Democrats. He was reelected three times with no substantial opposition.

In 2002, the Pennsylvania state legislature reconfigured Doyle&#x27;s district, combining it with the Pittsburgh-based district of fellow Democrat William J. Coyne. In the process, the state legislature redrew most of western Pennsylvania&#x27;s heavily Democratic areas into just two districts—the reconfigured 14th district and the 12th district of John Murtha. The potentially explosive situation of having two Democratic incumbents face each other in the primary was defused when Coyne announced his retirement (even though the district contained more of Coyne&#x27;s former territory than Doyle&#x27;s), leaving Doyle as the sole incumbent. The new district was by far the most Democratic district in western Pennsylvania, and Doyle was completely unopposed in 2002 and 2004; in 2006 and 2008, his only opposition was Green Party candidate Titus North.

====2008====
Doyle defeated Green Party candidate Titus North, 91%–9%.

====2010====

Doyle was challenged by Republican Melissa Haluszczak and Green Party Ed Bortz.

====2012====

Doyle defeated Republican Hans Lessmann, 76%–23%.

====2014====

Doyle ran unopposed in 2014. As of October 15, 2014, Doyle had raised $747,107 during the 2013–14 campaign cycle.

====2016====

Doyle defeated Republican Lenny McAllister, 74%–25%.

====2018====

Doyle again ran unopposed in 2018 for his 13th term in office, in a redrawn 18th district.

====2020====

Doyle won the Democratic nomination against a progressive challenger, Jerry Dickinson, a law professor from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. In the general election, he defeated Republican Luke Negron.

=== Tenure ===

====Time at the C Street Center====

Doyle came under fire in the 2000s for living in the C Street Center, a home run by Republican Christian fundamentalists in D.C. Additionally, he traveled with the group, or The Fellowship, to the Middle East in April 2009. The trip included travel to Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel on behalf of the Fellowship Foundation. Doyle met with political and religious leaders to help spread the Fellowship&#x27;s agenda. Doyle&#x27;s time with the Fellowship was mentioned in Jeff Sharlet&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;C Street: The Fundamentalist Threat to American Democracy.&quot; Sharlet documented trips and events made by Doyle and other politicians on the Fellowship&#x27;s behalf. Sharlet&#x27;s books were the basis for the 2016 Netflix docuseries &quot;The Family.&quot;

==Political positions==
Doyle voted against authorizing military force in Iraq and against the $87 billion emergency spending bill to fund U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is the co-founder and co-chair of the Coalition on Autism Research and Education, also known as the Congressional Autism Caucus, and he offered an amendment that was included in the health reform law to ensure that insurance companies cover treatments for people with autism. He has also introduced legislation to provide better services for adults with autism.

Early in his career, Doyle opposed abortion, but he began to support abortion rights in the 2010s, receiving more favorable ratings from interest groups like NARAL while scoring a 0 with groups such as the National Right to Life Committee. In the early 2000s, he voted to prohibit &quot;partial-birth/late term abortions&quot;. Doyle has also voted for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother&#x27;s life is in danger. He supports using federal dollars for Title X, family planning services, and Planned Parenthood, with the existing provision that federal funds may not be used to perform abortions.

Doyle has fought against gun laws that would allow people to bring firearms into national parks, repeal any part of the assault or military style weapon ban, or repeal parts of the D.C. gun ban. This has led to declining ratings from gun rights interest groups such as the NRA Political Victory Fund (42% lifetime rating in 2000 to 0% in 2006) and Gun Owners of America. Conversely, he has received high ratings from gun control groups, receiving a 90% in the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in 2003.

Doyle supports comprehensive immigration reform, voting for a bill that would repeal certain green card limitations, as well as the DREAM Act. These views have got him negative ratings from interest groups such as English First (0%) and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (0%). His immigration reviews resonate stronger with the National Latino Congreso/William C. Velásquez Institute and American Immigration Lawyers Association, from both of which he has received perfect scores.

Liberals have praised Doyle for his stance on copyright issues and his support of net neutrality. He was the lead sponsor of HR 1147, the Local Community Radio Act of 2009, which will expand low-power broadcasting to hundreds of new community radio stations. In 2010, he was given the Digital Patriot Award, along with Vint Cerf, one of the creators of the technology that runs the Internet. In February 2013, he became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research. Doyle is a strong supporter of letting local governments provide Internet services in order to increase competition, improve service, and decrease prices.

Doyle used his position on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to lead negotiations on legislation addressing climate change and promoting energy independence while protecting clean domestic manufacturing. He has been criticized for taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. Doyle backs the CLEAN Act, which has been criticized as less aggressive than the Green New Deal, with goals for 2050 as opposed to 2030.

Doyle is an outspoken critic of the genocide in Sudan and Darfur. In a rally on April 28, 2007, he urged President Bush to uphold his promise of sending 20,000 peacekeepers to Darfur. He drew loud cheers when he said, &quot;If we can have a surge in Iraq, there needs to be one in Sudan.&quot; He has said he supports LGBT rights, but voted for the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited same-sex marriage.

On October 16, 2012, Doyle released a statement criticizing the Republican budget introduced by Paul Ryan, saying that it would &quot;be devastating for seniors in Pittsburgh.&quot; According to his report, this budget would eliminate new preventive care benefits for 113,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the district, as well as other cuts to Medicaid, affordable housing, and food stamps. &quot;That&#x27;s why I voted against the Ryan budget when it was considered by Congress earlier this year, and why I am fighting hard to oppose Congressional Republicans&#x27; misguided priorities.&quot;

On December 18, 2019, Doyle voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald J. Trump.

===Legislation supported===
Doyle has had four of his bills passed into law since he took office: the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000, the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007, the Local Community Radio Act of 2010, and &quot;To designate the United States courthouse located at 700 Grant Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the &quot;Joseph F. Weis Jr. United States Courthouse&quot;.

*Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress) – a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes. The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations. Doyle argued in favor of the bill because &quot;the FCC is charged with overseeing industries that make up one-sixth of our national economy.&quot;
*Autism CARES Act of 2014 – a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to autism spectrum disorders (autism) conducted by various agencies within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Doyle co-sponsored the bill, saying that &quot;every time new data is realized on autism spectrum disorders, the numbers become more and more troubling... this is why passage of the Autism Cares Act today is so important to continue research into the causes of autism.&quot;

Doyle was ranked the 38th most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the third most bipartisan member of the House from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

==Personal life==
Doyle is Roman Catholic.

<text>An outfall is the discharge point of a waste stream into a body of water; alternatively it may be the outlet of a river, drain or a sewer where it discharges into the sea, a lake or ocean.

==United States of America==
In the United States, industrial facilities that discharge storm water which was exposed to industrial activities at the site are required to have a multi-sector general permit. Issuing permits for storm water is delegated to the individual states that are authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Facilities that apply for a permit must specify the number of outfalls at the site. According to the EPA&#x27;s &quot;Multi-Sector General Permit For Stormwater Discharges Associated With Industrial Activity&quot;, outfalls are locations where the stormwater exits the facility, including pipes, ditches, swales, and other structures that transport stormwater. If there is more than one outfall present, measure at the primary outfall (i.e., the outfall with the largest volume of stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity).
Outfalls from sewage plants can be up to in diameter and release of treated human waste miles from the shore.

A wastewater treatment system discharges treated effluent to a water body from an outfall. An ocean outfall may be conveyed several miles offshore, to discharge by nozzles at the end of a spreader or T-shaped structure. Outfalls may also be constructed as an outfall tunnel or subsea tunnel and discharge effluent to the ocean via one or more marine risers with nozzles.

<doc id="962300" wikidata="Q555130" url="?curid=962300" title="Lovell Telescope">
<text>The Lovell Telescope ( ) is a radio telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, near Goostrey, Cheshire, in the north-west of England. When construction was finished in 1957, the telescope was the largest steerable dish radio telescope in the world at 76.2 m (250 ft) in diameter;
it is now the third-largest, after the Green Bank telescope in West Virginia, United States, and the Effelsberg telescope in Germany.
It was originally known as the &quot;250 ft telescope&quot; or the Radio Telescope at Jodrell Bank, before becoming the Mark I telescope around 1961 when future telescopes (the Mark II, III, and IV) were being discussed. It was renamed to the Lovell Telescope in 1987 after Sir Bernard Lovell, and became a Grade I listed building in 1988. The telescope forms part of the MERLIN and European VLBI Network arrays of radio telescopes.

Both Bernard Lovell and Charles Husband were knighted for their roles in creating the telescope. In September 2006, the telescope won the BBC&#x27;s online competition to find the UK&#x27;s greatest &quot;Unsung Landmark&quot;. 2007 marked the 50th anniversary of the telescope.

If the air is clear enough, the Mark I telescope can be seen from high-rise buildings in Manchester such as the Beetham Tower, and from as far away as the Pennines, Winter Hill in Lancashire, Snowdonia, Beeston Castle in Cheshire, and the Peak District. It can also be seen from the south-facing windows of the Terminal 1 restaurant area and departure lounges of Manchester Airport.

== Construction ==

=== Conception and construction of the Mark I ===
Bernard Lovell built the Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank in the late 1940s. This was a -diameter radio telescope that could only point directly upwards; the next logical step was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.

Two circular 15&quot; turret drive gear sets and associated pinions from 15-inch (38-cm) gun turrets were bought cheaply in 1950; these came from the World War I battleships HMS &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, which were being broken up at the time. The bearings became the two main altitude rotator bearings of the telescope, with the appropriate parts of the telescope being designed around them. Husband presented the first drawings of the proposed giant, fully steerable radio telescope in 1950. After refinements, these plans were detailed in a &quot;Blue Book&quot;, which was presented to the DSIR on 20 March 1951; the proposal was approved in March 1952.

Construction began on 3 September 1952. The foundations for the telescope were completed on 21 May 1953 after being sunk into the ground. It then took until mid-March 1954 to get the double railway lines completed because of their required accuracy. The central pivot was delivered to the site on 11 May 1954, and the final bogie in mid-April 1955.
The telescope bowl was originally going to have a wire mesh surface to observe at wavelengths between 1 and 10 meters (3.2 and 32 feet), so frequencies between 30 and 300 MHz; this was changed to a steel surface so that the telescope could observe at the 21 cm (8 in) hydrogen line, which was discovered in 1951. Also, in February 1954 Lovell and the Air Ministry met to see if funding could be made available for improving the accuracy of the dish so that it could be used on centimetre wavelengths, for research at these wavelengths for the Ministry as well as &quot;other purposes&quot;. Although the funding was not ultimately made available from the Air Ministry, the planning process had already progressed, so this improvement was made anyway.

The telescope was constructed so that the bowl could be completely inverted. Originally, it was intended to use a movable tower at the base of the telescope to change the receivers at the focus. However, the movable tower was never built, jointly because of funding constraints and the fact that much of the receiver equipment was placed at the base of the telescope rather than at the focus. Instead, receivers were mounted on 50-foot (15-m) long steel tubes, which were then inserted by a winch into the top of the aerial tower while the bowl was inverted. The cables from the receivers then ran down the inside of this tube, which could then be connected when the telescope was pointed at the zenith. Associated receiver equipment could then be placed either in the small, swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface; in rooms at the tops of the two towers; at the base girders, or in the control building.

The telescope moved for the first time on 3 February 1957: by an inch. It was first moved azimuthally under power on 12 June 1957; the bowl was tilted under power for the first time on 20 June 1957. By the end of July the dish surface was completed, and first light was on 2 August 1957; the telescope did a drift scan across the Milky Way at 160 MHz, with the bowl at the zenith. The telescope was first controlled from the control room on 9 October 1957, by a purpose-built analogue computer.

There were large cost overruns with the telescope&#x27;s construction, mainly the result of the steeply rising cost of steel during construction. The original grant for the telescope came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly because of the telescope&#x27;s early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.

=== Upgrade to Mark IA ===
Shortly after the telescope was originally completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating an upgrade to the telescope so that it had a more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working; had they not been put right the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.

The first phase saw the addition of an inner railway track, which was designed to take a third of the weight of the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four bogies and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled.

The third phase saw the biggest changes; a new, more accurate bowl surface was constructed in front of the old surface, meaning that the telescope could be used on wavelengths as small as 6 cm (5 GHz), and the central &quot;bicycle wheel&quot; support was added. A new computer control system was also installed (reusing the Ferranti Argus 104 computer from the Mark II); fatigue cracks in the cones connecting the bowl to the towers were repaired, and the central antenna was lengthened and strengthened. In January 1972 the hoist carrying two engineers to the central antenna broke, gravely injuring one and killing the other.

The Mark IA upgrade was formally completed on 16 July 1974, when the telescope was handed back to the University of Manchester. Because of increases in the cost of steel during the upgrade, the final amount for the upgrade was £664,793.07.

=== Later upgrades and repairs ===
The Gale of January 1976 on 2 January brought winds of around 90 mph (140 km/h), which almost destroyed the telescope. The towers bowed, and one of the bearings connecting the dish to the towers slipped. After an expensive repair, diagonal bracing girders were added to the towers to prevent this happening again.

By the 1990s, the telescope surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–03, the telescope was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5 GHz by a factor of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5 cm (compared to 18 cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.

In 2007 the telescope needed a new drive wheel, as one of the 64 original wheels had cracked; in 2008 another new steel tyre was needed after a second wheel cracked. These are the only two wheel changes needed since the telescope started operation in 1957.

The presence (as at 2010) of two breeding pairs of wild peregrine falcons (nesting one in each of the telescope&#x27;s two support towers) prevents the nuisance of pigeon infestation (by droppings fouling, and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) that some other radio telescopes suffer from.

Close to one of the buildings at the observatory stands a bust of Nicolaus Copernicus, Polish Renaissance-era mathematician and astronomer who developed the heliocentric model of the universe, with Sun, rather than the Earth, at its centre.

== Space probe tracking ==

=== Sputnik and artificial satellites ===

The telescope became operational in the summer of 1957, just in time for the launch of Sputnik 1, the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik&#x27;s booster rocket by radar; it first located it just before midnight on 12 October 1957. It also located Sputnik 2&#x27;s carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.

The telescope also took part in some of the early work on satellite communication. In February and March 1963, the telescope transmitted signals via the moon and Echo II, a NASA balloon satellite at 750 km (466 mi) altitude, to the Zimenki Observatory in the USSR. Some signals were also relayed from the US to the USSR via Jodrell Bank.

=== The race to the Moon ===

The Lovell Telescope was used to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The telescope tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, Pioneer 3 in December 1958, and Pioneer 4 in March 1959. The telescope tracked Pioneer 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960, and was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones to turn on the more powerful transmitter when the probe was away. It also received data from Pioneer 5, and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time. The last signal was picked up from the probe at a distance of on the 26 June 1960.

The telescope also tracked the Soviet Moon probes. An attempt to track Luna 1 failed. The telescope successfully tracked Lunik II from 13 to 14 September 1959 as it hit the moon; this was proven by the telescope by measuring the effect of the Moon&#x27;s gravity on the probe, and Luna 3 around 4 October 1959. Also, the telescope tracked Luna 9 in February 1966, the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon. The telescope listened in on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the Moon&#x27;s surface. The photos were sent to the British press – the probe transmitted, likely intentionally to increase chances of reception, in the international format for image transmission by newswire – and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.

The telescope tracked Luna 10, a Russian satellite put into orbit around the Moon, in April 1966, and Zond 5 in September 1968, a Russian probe containing two tortoises that was launched at the Moon, around which it sling-shotted before returning to Earth. The telescope did not track Apollo 11, as it was tracking Luna 15 in July 1969. However, a telescope at Jodrell Bank was used at the same time to track Apollo 11.

=== Venus probes ===
The telescope possibly detected signals from Venera 1, a Russian satellite en route to Venus, during 19–20 May 1961. However, it was not possible to confirm the origin of the signals. A few years later, in December 1962, the telescope tracked and received data from Mariner 2. On 18 October 1967, the telescope received signals from, and tracked, Venera 4, a Russian probe to Venus.

=== Mars probes ===
The telescope tracked Mars 1 in 1962–63, and Mars 2 and Mars 3 in 1971 (amidst the upgrade of the telescope to the Mark IA). In more recent years, it has also searched for several lost Mars spacecraft, including NASA&#x27;s Mars Observer spacecraft in 1993, Mars Polar Lander in 2000,
and the Beagle 2 lander on Mars in 2003. However, it did not succeed in locating any of them.

=== ICBM watchdog ===
As a stopgap measure while RAF Fylingdales was being built, the telescope was on standby for &quot;Project Verify&quot; (also known by the codewords &quot;Lothario&quot; and &quot;Changlin&quot;) between April 1962 and September 1963. During strategic alerts, a &#x27;pulse transmitter, receiver and display equipment&#x27; could be connected to the telescope to scan known Russian launch sites for indications of launches of ICBMs and/or IRBMs. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the telescope was discreetly turned towards the Iron Curtain to provide a few minutes&#x27; warning of any missiles that might have been launched.

== Scientific observations ==
When the telescope was proposed, a series of objectives for the telescope&#x27;s observations were set out. These included:
* Surveys of galactic and extragalactic radio emission
* Observations of the Sun
* Radar echoes from the planets
* Investigation of meteor detections
* Observations of the Gegenschein
* Studies of the Aurora
* Detections of radio reflections from cosmic ray ionization in the atmosphere

However, the actual observations made with the telescope differ from these original objectives, and are outlined in the following sections.

=== Solar system ===
In Autumn 1958, the telescope was used to bounce &quot;Hellos&quot; off the Moon for a demonstration in Lovell&#x27;s third Reith Lecture. The telescope was also used to receive messages bounced off the Moon (a &quot;moonbounce&quot;) as part of the 50th anniversary First Move festival. In April 1961, a radar echo from Venus was achieved using the telescope while the planet was at a close approach, confirming measurements of the distance of the planet made by American telescopes.

=== 21cm hydrogen line ===

The 21 cm hydrogen line was discovered during the telescope&#x27;s construction; the telescope was subsequently redesigned so that it could observe at that frequency. Using this line emission, hydrogen clouds both in the Milky Way galaxy and in other galaxies can be observed; for example, the telescope discovered a large cloud around the M81 and M82 galaxies. The motion of these clouds either towards or away from us either redshifts or blueshifts the line, allowing the velocity to the cloud to be measured. This provides a probe of the internal dynamics of galaxies, and can also provide a measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe.

=== Masers ===

In 1963, the telescope discovered OH emissions from star-forming regions and giant stars; the first astronomical masers. OH masers emit on four frequencies around 18 cm (7 in), which are easily observable on the telescope. As part of MERLIN, the telescope is regularly used to construct maps of maser regions.

=== Pulsars ===
In 1968, the telescope observed the coordinates of the recently discovered pulsar, confirming its existence and investigating the dispersion measure. It was also used to make the first detection of polarization of the pulsar&#x27;s radiation. This marked the start of a substantial amount of work investigating pulsars at Jodrell, which is still ongoing. In the 30 years following the discovery of pulsars, the telescope discovered over 100 new pulsars (and astronomers at Jodrell Bank discovered around 2/3 of the total number using the Lovell and other telescopes). 300 pulsars are regularly observed using either the Lovell, or a nearby 42-foot (13-m) dish.

The telescope was involved in the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a globular cluster in 1986: a millisecond pulsar in the Messier 28 globular cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, as well as with the Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced; these confirmed that the general theory of relativity is accurate to 99.5%.

=== Gravitational lensing ===
Between 1972 and 1973, the telescope was used for &quot;a detailed survey of the radio sources in a limited area of the sky … up to the sensitivity limit of the instrument&quot;. Among the objects catalogued was the first gravitational lens, which was confirmed optically in 1979 after its position was found to coincide with a pair of faint blue stars by using the Mark I as an interferometer with the Mark II. The telescope was also involved in the detection of the first Einstein ring in 1998, in conjunction with observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope.

=== Quasars and interferometry ===

The early investigation into the size and nature of quasars drove the development of interferometry techniques in the 1950s; the Lovell telescope had an advantage because of its large collecting area, meaning that it could make high-sensitivity interferometer measurements relatively quickly. As a result, the telescope featured heavily in the discovery of quasars.
Interferometry at Jodrell Bank started before the Lovell telescope was constructed, using the Transit Telescope with a 35 m2 broadside array to determine the size of radio-loud nebulae. Once construction of the Lovell telescope was complete, the broadside array was put on a steerable mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer. This was then used to determine the 2D shape of quasars on the sky. In the summer of 1961, a 25-foot (8-m) diameter paraboloid telescope was constructed (of aluminium tubing and mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar). This was then used as a steerable interferometer with the Mark I, with a resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, to determine the sizes of some high-redshift (z~0.86) quasars.

The Mark II telescope once constructed was also used as an interferometer with the Lovell telescope. This has a baseline of 425 m (1,394 ft) (meaning that it can synthesize a telescope with 425 m diameter), giving it a resolution of around 0.5 arcminutes. This telescope pair has been used to carry out survey work, and to determine the positions of faint radio objects. Also, one of the drivers behind the construction of the Mark III was to use it as an interferometer with the Mark I to carry out a survey of radio sources.

The telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. It was first used as an interferometer with the Arecibo radio telescope in 1969.

In 1980, it was used as part of the new MERLIN array with a series of smaller radio telescopes controlled from Jodrell Bank. With baselines of up to 217 km (135 mi), this gave a resolution around 0.05 arcminutes. An upgraded version of this became a national facility in 1992. It has also been used in Very Long Baseline Interferometry, with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds. Around half of the telescope&#x27;s observing time is now spent doing interferometry with other telescopes. It is planned that the telescope will work as part of an interferometer with the Radioastron (Russian) and VLBI Space Observatory Programme (Japanese) orbital radio satellites, providing yet larger baselines and higher resolutions. 

=== Other notable observations ===

The telescope was used as a follow-up instrument for possible SETI detections made at Arecibo between 1998 and the end of 2003. No signals were detected. In February 2005, astronomers using the Lovell Telescope discovered the galaxy VIRGOHI21 that appears to be made almost entirely of dark matter.

== In popular culture ==
* A 1:200 scale model of the telescope, made in 1961, resides in the Science Museum, London.
* In 1962, the telescope was mentioned in a sci-fi novel &quot;A for Andromeda&quot;, by Fred Hoyle and John Elliot.
* The 1981 Doctor Who serial &quot;Logopolis&quot;, filmed at Crowsley Park, used a model of the Lovell Telescope as the Pharos Project, from which the Doctor, played by Tom Baker, fell and regenerated. The model was based on the Mark I telescope, but it also featured some modifications from the Mark IA telescope such as the rim around the edge of the dish.
* Sophie Aldred portrayed the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion Ace, standing on both the superstructure and dish in the 1990 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; educational special &quot;Search Out Science: Search Out Space&quot;.
* In 1992, the telescope was featured on the cover of Sub Sub&#x27;s &quot;Space Face&quot; single.
* The telescope also made a brief appearance in the film version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; in 2005.
* Four bands have shot music videos or photos in the bowl of the telescope: Oasis in June 1994 by Steve Double, D:Ream in 1995 (&quot;Party Up the World&quot;), Placebo in 2003 (&quot;The Bitter End&quot;), and Public Service Broadcasting in 2015 (&quot;Sputnik&quot;). Long shots of the telescope feature in the music video of &quot;Secret Messages&quot; by Electric Light Orchestra.
* The Royal Mail depicted the telescope as &quot;J for Jodrell Bank&quot; in their alphabetical landmarks stamp series; it has also previously featured on stamps from Haiti, Hungary, Ascension Island, Barbuda, Liechtenstein and Tanzania.
* In an August 1981 episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; the telescope was seen. Len and Rita Fairclough brought the boy they were fostering to see the telescope.

<doc id="962307" wikidata="Q4885273" url="?curid=962307" title="Ben Barnes (Texas politician)">
<text>Benny Frank Barnes (born April 17, 1938) is an American real estate magnate, politician, and crisis manager, who formerly served as Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives from 1965 to 1969 and the 36th Lieutenant Governor of Texas from January 21, 1969, to January 16, 1973, for two two-year terms. He was a vice-chair, as well as top fund-raiser, of John Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign. Barnes was also one of only eight persons who raised over $500,000 for Kerry.

==Early life and education==

Barnes was born on April 17, 1938, in Gorman in Eastland County, Texas, to peanut farmer B.F. Barnes and Ina B. Carrigan. He was raised with a younger brother, Rick. Barnes&#x27; family owned a peanut farm in Comanche County, in central Texas. They cultivated about 40 acres, growing peanuts and corn and raising hogs and chickens. The family was poor, having no working electricity until 1946, when government agents brought electricity to Texas farms as a result of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Rural Electrification Administration.

Barnes graduated from De Leon High School in 1956. After high school, Barnes enrolled for one semester at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, followed by a semester at Tarleton College (now Tarleton State University) in Stephenville, Texas. During that spring, he married his high school sweetheart, Martha Morgan. He then spent the following summer in Climax, Colorado, working at the molybdenum mine there. In 1957, at the age of 20, Barnes began studying at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was on the Dean&#x27;s List for the Business School. Barnes took several jobs to pay his way through college, including a door-to-door job selling Electrolux vacuum cleaners. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in business.

==Political career==
===Texas House===

While a student at The University of Texas, Barnes worked at the Texas State Health Department. After discovering some financial irregularities that led to the indictment of the state health commissioner, Barnes became interested in politics. At the age of 21, Barnes went back to his home area of the state and ran for state representative, pulling off an upset victory. Advancing quickly through the Texas legislature, by 1963, Barnes was chairman of the powerful Rules Committee. In 1965, the Texas Junior Chamber of Commerce named Barnes as one of &quot;Five Outstanding Young Texans&quot; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recognized Barnes as one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Men in America&quot; in 1970.

===Speaker of the Texas House===
In the lead up to 1965, Barnes began accumulating pledges of support from colleagues to succeed Byron Tunnell if the Speaker decided not to seek a third term in 1967. He didn&#x27;t have to wait that long. Just before the 1965 session, a vacancy occurred on the Railroad Commission and John Connally came up with the clever idea of appointing Byron Tunnell, who was only a lukewarm supporter of Connally&#x27;s activist legislative program, to fill the seat. Barnes had advance notice of the maneuver, so when Connally announced Tunnell&#x27;s appointment, Barnes had already set up a war room in the Driskill Hotel. He started calling members to make good the pledges he had collected. Potential rivals never had a chance.

With the governor and the business lobby and all but a handful of House members behind him, Barnes was an instant powerhouse. The press latched on to the story of the young man with a limitless future. The headlines tell the tale: “Ben Barnes—Man Going Places,” “Boy Wonder of Texas Politics,” “Big Crowd Hears LBJ Predict White House for Ben Barnes.”

During his speakership, Barnes placed a high priority on the state&#x27;s colleges and universities, with financial support for these institutions rising by 300 percent. Furthermore, he helped establish the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Under Barnes, salaries increased for university professors, the University of Houston merged with the state university system, and Angelo State College and Pan American College turned into four-year institutions.

Furthermore, Barnes won passage of a minimum wage standard for farm workers, played a key role in winning approval for clean air and water legislation, and successfully fought for a bill creating the Texas Rehabilitation Commission. The political future seemed limitless for Barnes, who enjoyed the support of Connally and President Lyndon Johnson who, after leaving the White House, predicted that his young protégé would one day claim the presidency.

In 1966, Barnes was the President of the National Legislative Conference and in 1967, was voted President of the Southern Legislative Conference—the youngest person and first Texan to receive the honor. He was also U.S. representative to the NATO Conference in 1967, and the United Nations Representative to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1968.

===Lieutenant governor===
In his 1968 race for Lieutenant Governor, Barnes carried all 254 counties in both the primary and the general elections; in the latter he won more votes than any candidate had polled up to that time in the history of Texas. Barnes served as Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1969 to 1973, a post often called the most powerful position in the Texas state government because the lieutenant governor can block a governor&#x27;s agenda from being considered by the Texas State Senate. As lieutenant governor, he successfully backed an increase in the minimum wage, legislation in the area of mass transportion, and legislation creating the Texas Rehabilitation Commission. Throughout his four terms in the two offices, Barnes also was interested in the issue of higher education. During that time, Texas increased its appropriations for higher education more than threefold, rising to near the top in its ranking among the 50 states in expenditures for higher education. Several new universities and graduate schools originated as a result of increased appropriations.

===Sharpstown scandal===
In 1971, Barnes was caught up along with the Democratic Party in Texas in the political fallout of the Sharpstown scandal, though he stated he had no knowledge of the involvement of several state senators in the scheme. While he was not brought to trial, the scandal contributed to an unsuccessful run for governor and Barnes&#x27; exit from public office.

===Claim of helping George W. Bush into the National Guard===
In 1999, Barnes gave testimony in a deposition for a lawsuit related to the Texas lottery; following the deposition, his lawyer issued a statement to the press. According to the statement, Barnes had called the head of the Texas Air National Guard, Brigadier General James Rose, to recommend future U.S. president George W. Bush for a pilot spot at the request of Bush family friend Sidney Adger. The statement also said, &quot;Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush family asked Barnes&#x27; help. Barnes has no knowledge that Governor Bush or President Bush knew of Barnes&#x27; recommendation.&quot; While working as an active fundraiser for John Kerry, Bush&#x27;s opponent during the 2004 U.S. Presidential campaign, Barnes repeated that he used his political influence to preferentially refer people to the National Guard, including Bush.

Both George W. Bush and his father, former U.S. president George H. W. Bush, have stated that they did not ask Adger to intercede and were unaware of any action he may have taken. Walter Staudt, the colonel in command of Bush&#x27;s squadron, has stated that he accepted Bush&#x27;s application without receiving any outside pressure to do so.

===Involvement in the Iran hostage crisis===
In March 2023, motivated by news of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s hospice care, Barnes corroborated the 1980 October Surprise theory by telling journalist Peter Baker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; that in the summer of 1980 he was unwittingly involved in relaying promises from Reagan campaign officials to ask Iranian officials to withhold release of the hostages they held until after the 1980 presidential elections. According to Barnes, in the summer of 1980 he accompanied former Texas governor and a former candidate in the 1980 presidential election, John Connally, on a trip to several Middle Eastern countries which records indicate to have included Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel. Barnes claimed in 2023 that during the trip Connally would promote Ronald Reagan&#x27;s candidacy to leaders of those countries, and told those leaders (except for the leaders in Israel) ‘It would be very smart for you to pass the word to the Iranians to wait until after this general election is over.’ Barnes asserted that he did not know in advance that Connally would say that on the trip, and believed that Connally was positioning himself for a nomination by a future Reagan Administration for either Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Reagan did offer Connally the position of Secretary of Energy, but Connally declined. Barnes also claimed that shortly after returning to the United States, Connally reported on their trip to William J. Casey, who was chairman of Reagan&#x27;s campaign, and later Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A note in Connally&#x27;s files confirms that he had contact with the Reagan camp early during the trip.

Reactions among the former hostages to Barnes&#x27; 2023 revelations were mixed. One former hostage criticized Barnes for not coming forward for more than 40 years. Others either did not believe Barnes&#x27; account, or said that Barnes confirmed their suspicions as to what went on behind the scenes.

==Real estate career==

During the 1970s and 1980s, Barnes developed a multimillion-dollar real estate empire which included the development of such projects as Southwest Parkway and Barton Creek Country Club in Austin. The collapse of oil prices in the mid- to late- 1980s and its effect on the Texas real estate market forced Barnes to file for bankruptcy, following the financial collapse of the Barnes/Connally Partnership, a real estate firm.

==Lobbying and business career==

In the late 1990s, Barnes began working with GTECH Corporation, a company that operated lotteries in 37 states including Texas. Barnes is the founder of the Ben Barnes Group (formerly known as Entrecorp), a business consulting and real estate development firm offering expertise in crisis management, legislative processes and strategy, legal issues, and public-private partnerships. Clients range from major Fortune 500 companies to small family-owned businesses, as from a variety of both international and domestic industries. The Ben Barnes Group maintains offices in Washington, D.C., New York City, and Austin, Texas. He is noted for his success and insider relations in Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas. He said: &quot;Every Democratic senator who is running for reelection has been to Texas for a fundraiser. We’ve got one coming up for Tim Johnson [of South Dakota].&quot; Barnes has also served as a consultant, director, or chairman of more than two dozen companies, including SBC Communications, American Airlines, Dallas Bank and Trust, Grumman Systems Support Corporation, and Laredo National Bank.

==Personal life==

Barnes was married to Martha Morgan in 1957, and they had two children together: Greg and Amy. He was briefly linked with Jill St. John. In 1989, Barnes married Melanie Harper. Barnes and Harper adopted two daughters: Elena Barnes and Blaire Barnes. On September 14, 2019, Ben Barnes and Elizabeth Moore McDermott married at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Nantucket.

==Awards and volunteering==
In 1995, The University of Texas named him a Distinguished Alumnus and an endowed fellowship was created in his name at UT&#x27;s Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. Barnes serves on the board of several non-profit organizations, including the Boys &amp; Girls Club of the Austin Area, the Roosevelt Institute and the Development Board of the University of Texas. Barnes also serves as vice-chairman of the LBJ Foundation.

==Writing==
Barnes is the author of the book &quot;Barn Burning Barn Building: Tales of a Political Life, From LBJ to George W. Bush and Beyond&quot; () (with Lisa Dickey), which was first published in 2006. It went on to place on The New York Times Best Seller list.

Sloterdijk has since published a number of philosophical works acclaimed in Germany. In 2001, he was named chancellor of the University of Art and Design Karlsruhe, part of the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. His best-known Karlsruhe student and former assistant is Marc Jongen, a member of the Bundestag. In 2002, Sloterdijk began to co-host &quot;Das Philosophische Quartett&quot; (&quot;The Philosophical Quartet&quot;), a show on the German ZDF television channel devoted to discussing key contemporary issues in-depth.

== Philosophical stance ==

Sloterdijk rejects the existence of dualisms—body and soul, subject and object, culture and nature, etc.—since their interactions, &quot;spaces of coexistence&quot;, and common technological advancement create hybrid realities. Sloterdijk&#x27;s ideas are sometimes referred to as posthumanism, and seek to integrate different components that have been, in his opinion, erroneously considered detached from each other. Consequently, he proposes the creation of an &quot;ontological constitution&quot; that would incorporate all beings—humans, animals, plants, and machines.

== Philosophical style ==

In the style of Nietzsche, Sloterdijk remains convinced that contemporary philosophers have to think dangerously and let themselves be &quot;kidnapped&quot; by contemporary &quot;hyper-complexities&quot;: they must forsake our present humanist and nationalist world for a wider horizon at once ecological and global.
Sloterdijk&#x27;s philosophical style strikes a balance between the firm academicism of a scholarly professor and a certain sense of anti-academicism (witness his ongoing interest in the ideas of Osho, of whom he became a disciple in the late seventies). Taking a sociological stance, Andreas Dorschel sees Sloterdijk&#x27;s timely innovation at the beginning of the 21st century in having introduced the principles of celebrity into philosophy. Sloterdijk himself, viewing exaggeration as necessary to catch attention, describes the way he presents his ideas as &quot;hyperbolic&quot; (&quot;hyperbolisch&quot;).

==Major Works==

===&quot;Critique of Cynical Reason&quot;===

The &quot;Kritik der zynischen Vernunft&quot;, published by Suhrkamp in 1983 (and in English as &quot;Critique of Cynical Reason&quot;, 1987), became the best-selling work on philosophy in the German language since the Second World War and launched Sloterdijk&#x27;s career as an author.

===&quot;Spheres&quot;===

The trilogy &quot;Spheres&quot; is the philosopher&#x27;s magnum opus. The first volume was published in 1998, the second in 1999, and the last in 2004.

&quot;Spheres&quot; deals with &quot;spaces of coexistence&quot;, spaces commonly overlooked or taken for granted which conceal information crucial to developing an understanding of humanity. The exploration of these spheres begins with the basic difference between mammals and other animals: the biological and utopian comfort of the mother&#x27;s womb, which humans try to recreate through science, ideology, and religion. From these microspheres (ontological relations such as fetus-placenta) to macrospheres (&quot;macro-uteri&quot; such as states), Sloterdijk analyzes spheres where humans try but fail to dwell and traces a connection between vital crises (e.g., emptiness and narcissistic detachment) and crises created when a sphere shatters.

Sloterdijk has said that the first paragraphs of &quot;Spheres&quot; are &quot;the book that Heidegger should have written&quot;, a companion volume to &quot;Being and Time&quot;, namely, &quot;Being and Space&quot;. He was referring to his initial exploration of the idea of &quot;Dasein&quot;, which is then taken further as Sloterdijk distances himself from Heidegger&#x27;s positions.

===&quot;Nietzsche Apostle&quot;===

On 25 August 2000, in Weimar, Sloterdijk gave a speech on Nietzsche; the occasion was the centennial of the latter philosopher&#x27;s death. The speech was later printed as a short book and translated into English. Sloterdijk presented the idea that language is fundamentally narcissistic: individuals, states and religions use language to promote and validate themselves. Historically however, Christianity and norms in Western culture have prevented orators and authors from directly praising themselves, so that for example they would instead venerate God or praise the dead in eulogies, to demonstrate their own skill by proxy. In Sloterdijk&#x27;s account, Nietzsche broke with this norm by regularly praising himself in his own work.

For examples of classical Western &quot;proxy-narcissism&quot;, Sloterdijk cites Otfrid of Weissenburg, Thomas Jefferson and Leo Tolstoy, each of whom prepared edited versions of the four Gospels: the &quot;Evangelienbuch&quot;, the &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot; and the &quot;Gospel in Brief&quot;, respectively. For Sloterdijk, each work can be regarded as &quot;a fifth gospel&quot; in which the editor validates his own culture by editing tradition to conform to his own historical situation. With this background, Sloterdijk explains that Nietzsche also presented his work &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; as a kind of fifth gospel. In Sloterdijk&#x27;s account, Nietzsche engages in narcissism to an embarrassing degree, particularly in &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, promoting a form of individualism and presenting himself and his philosophy as a brand. However, just as the Christian Gospels were appropriated by the above editors, so too was Nietzsche&#x27;s thought appropriated and misinterpreted by the Nazis. Sloterdijk concludes the work by comparing Nietzsche&#x27;s individualism with that of Ralph Waldo Emerson, as in &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;.

===&quot;Globalization&quot;===

Sloterdijk also argues that the current concept of globalization lacks historical perspective. In his view it is merely the third wave in a process of overcoming distances (the first wave being the metaphysical globalization of the Greek cosmology and the second the nautical globalization of the 15th and 16th centuries). The difference for Sloterdijk is that, while the second wave created cosmopolitanism, the third is creating a global provincialism. Sloterdijk&#x27;s sketch of a philosophical history of globalization can be found in &quot;Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals&quot; (2005; translated as &quot;In the World Interior of Capital&quot;), subtitled &quot;Die letzte Kugel&quot; (&quot;The final sphere&quot;). In an interview with Noema Magazine, Sloterdijk expanded upon the idea of “planetary co-immunism”, referring to the need to &quot;share the means of protection even with the most distant members of the family of man/woman&quot; when faced with shared threats such as pandemics.

===&quot;Rage and Time&quot;===

In his &quot;Zorn und Zeit&quot; (translated as &quot;Rage and Time&quot;), Sloterdijk characterizes the emotion of rage as a psychopolitical force throughout human history. The political aspects are especially pronounced in the Western tradition, beginning with the opening words of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;Of the rage of Achilles, son of Peleus, sing, O Goddess...&quot;. Sloterdijk acknowledges the contributions of psychoanalysis for our understanding of strong emotional attitudes: &quot;In conformity with its basic erotodynamic approach, psychoanalysis brought much hatred to light, the other side of life.&quot; (&quot;Rage and Time&quot;, p. 14) Importantly, for Sloterdijk, Judeo-Christian conceptions of God ultimately &quot;piggyback&quot; on the feelings of rage and resentment, creating &quot;metaphysical revenge banks&quot;. For Sloterdijk, &quot;God thus becomes the location of a transcendent repository of suspended human rage-savings and frozen plans of revenge.&quot;

== Reprogenetics dispute ==

Shortly after Sloterdijk conducted a symposium on philosophy and Heidegger, he stirred up controversy with his essay &quot;Regeln für den Menschenpark&quot; (&quot;Rules for the Human Park&quot;, 1999). In this text, Sloterdijk regards cultures and civilizations as &quot;anthropogenic hothouses,&quot; installations for the cultivation of human beings; just as we have established wildlife preserves to protect certain animal species, so too ought we to adopt more deliberate policies to ensure the survival of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;zoon politikon&quot;.

&quot;The taming of man has failed&quot;, Sloterdijk laments. &quot;Civilisation&#x27;s potential for barbarism is growing; the everyday bestialisation of man is on the increase.&quot;

Because of the eugenic policies of the Nazis in Germany&#x27;s recent history, such discussions are seen in Germany as carrying a sinister load. Breaking a German taboo on the discussion of genetic manipulation, Sloterdijk&#x27;s essay suggests that the advent of new genetic technologies requires more forthright discussion and regulation of &quot;bio-cultural&quot; reproduction. In the eyes of Habermas, this made Sloterdijk a &quot;fascist&quot;. Sloterdijk replied that this was, itself, resorting to &quot;fascist&quot; tactics to discredit him.
The core of the controversy was not only Sloterdijk&#x27;s ideas but also his use of the German words &quot;Züchtung&quot; (&quot;breeding&quot;, &quot;cultivation&quot;) and &quot;Selektion&quot; (&quot;selection&quot;). Sloterdijk rejected the accusation of Nazism, which he considered alien to his historical context. Still, the paper started a controversy in which Sloterdijk was strongly criticized, both for his alleged usage of a fascist rhetoric to promote Plato&#x27;s vision of a government with absolute control over the population, and for committing a non-normative, simplistic reduction of the bioethical issue itself. This second criticism was based on the vagueness of Sloterdijk&#x27;s position on how exactly society would be affected by developments in genetic science. After the controversy multiplied positions both for and against him, &quot;Die Zeit&quot; published an open letter from Sloterdijk to Habermas in which he vehemently accused Habermas of &quot;criticizing behind his back&quot; and espousing a view of humanism that Sloterdijk had declared dead.

== Welfare state dispute ==

Another dispute emerged after Sloterdijk&#x27;s article &quot;Die Revolution der gebenden Hand&quot; (13 June 2009; transl. &quot;The revolution of the giving hand&quot;) in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine&quot;, one of Germany&#x27;s most widely read newspapers. There Sloterdijk claimed that the national welfare state is a &quot;fiscal kleptocracy&quot; that had transformed the country into a &quot;swamp of resentment&quot; and degraded its citizens into &quot;mystified subjects of tax law&quot;.

Sloterdijk opened the text with the famous quote of leftist critics of capitalism (made famous in the 19th century by Proudhon in his &quot;What Is Property?&quot;) &quot;Property is theft&quot;, stating, however, that it is nowadays the modern state that is the biggest taker. &quot;We are living in a fiscal grabbing semi-socialism – and nobody calls for a fiscal civil war.&quot; He repeated his statements and stirred up the debate in his articles titled &quot;Kleptokratie des Staates&quot; (transl. &quot;Kleptocracy of the state&quot;) and &quot;Aufbruch der Leistungsträger&quot; (transl. &quot;Uprising of the performers&quot;) in the German monthly &quot;Cicero – Magazin für politische Kultur&quot;.

According to Sloterdijk, the institutions of the welfare state lend themselves to a system that privileges the marginalized, but relies, unsustainably, on the class of citizens who are materially successful. Sloterdijk&#x27;s provocative recommendation was that income taxes should be deeply reduced, the difference being made up by donations from the rich in a system that would reward higher givers with social status. Achievers would be praised for their generosity, rather than being made to feel guilty for their success, or resentful of society&#x27;s dependence on them.

In January 2010, an English translation was published, titled &quot;A Grasping Hand – The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens&quot;, in &quot;Forbes&quot; and in the Winter 2010 issue of &quot;City Journal&quot;. Sloterdijk&#x27;s 2010 book, &quot;Die nehmende Hand und die gebende Seite&quot;, contains the texts that triggered the 2009–2010 welfare state dispute.

<doc id="962312" wikidata="Q15846511" url="?curid=962312" title="Chart Attack">
<text>Chart Attack (stylized as CHARTattack) was a Canadian online music publication. Formerly a monthly print magazine, it was called &quot;Chart&quot; and published from 1991 to 2009. Online content ceased to be updated sometime between mid 2017 to 2019, after which owner Channel Zero laid off the site&#x27;s staff. The site&#x27;s content is no longer available live online, the domain has been taken over by a usurping commercial website unrelated to music. Much of the old content is still available as web archives at the Wayback Machine.

==History and profile==
Launched in 1991 as &quot;National Chart&quot;, the magazine was started by York University students Edward Skira and Nada Laskovski as a tipsheet and airplay chart for campus radio stations in Canada. The magazine soon grew to include interviews, CD reviews and other features. &quot;National Chart&quot; was considered an internal publication for the National Campus and Community Radio Association, Canada&#x27;s association of campus radio stations, and was not available as a newsstand title.

When Skira and Laskovski graduated, they incorporated &quot;Chart&quot; as an independent magazine, and began to pursue national newsstand distribution. Although it was no longer an NCRA publication, many campus radio stations continued to file airplay reports for the magazine&#x27;s Top 50 chart even though its status as the official NCRA chart was transferred to the new publication &quot;!earshot&quot;.

The magazine&#x27;s primary focus was Canadian alternative rock and indie rock, although they profiled important international acts, and rap and pop music acts as well. At its peak, the magazine had a press run of 40,000 copies per issue, making it the largest paid circulation music magazine in Canada in its era.

The magazine ceased publishing a print edition in 2009, continuing as a web-only publication. The website briefly suspended publication in summer 2011, but its acquisition by andPOP, a Canadian entertainment news website, was announced on November 1, 2011. In 2013, andPop was in turn acquired by Channel Zero.

The site laid off its staff in 2017.

==Reader polls==
In 1996, 2000 and 2005, the magazine conducted polls of readers, musicians and music industry professionals to determine the 50 best Canadian albums and songs of all time. There were 25 albums and 18 songs which ranked in the top 50 in all three polls.

<doc id="962315" wikidata="Q2975578" url="?curid=962315" title="Clarence Saunders">
<text>Clarence Saunders (August 9, 1881 – October 14, 1953) was an American grocer who first developed the modern retail sales model of self service. His ideas have had a massive influence on the development of the modern supermarket. Saunders worked for most of his life trying to develop a truly automated store, developing Piggly Wiggly, Keedoozle, and Foodelectric store concepts.

==Early life==
Saunders was born on a farm in Amherst County, Virginia, to Abram Warwick and Mary Gregory. Saunders&#x27; mother died when he was five. Abram had served in the Confederate army under Stonewall Jackson but had struggled financially in the aftermath of the war. In 1891, his father moved the family to Montgomery County, Tennessee, where his father worked as a laborer and sharecropper on a plantation near Palmyra, Tennessee. Saunders worked the plantation as well throughout his early childhood. By age 11, he was also working in a sawmill and limestone kiln during the summer and at a general store during the holidays. He received only two years of formal education in Palmyra, before quitting school entirely at 14 to work full-time for the general store. Saunders worked a variety of occupations over the next five years throughout the region, including shop assistant, night watchman and sawmill laborer. Recognizing the need for further education to advance, Saunders became a prolific reader and autodidact. At age 19, Saunders had moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, where he started working in the wholesale grocery business for John Hurst and Joseph Boillin, rapidly rising in the business. 

In Clarksville Saunders met Carolyn Amy Walker, the daughter of a prominent Illinois attorney. Despite their contrasting backgrounds, they were married on 6 October 1903. The following year they moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where Saunders took up positions working for the wholesale grocers Shanks, Phillips &amp; Co, as well as William Cole Early. Memphis in this period was booming the population had soared from 33,000 in 1880 to more than 100,000 by the time the Saunders&#x27; arrived. A major river point and railroad junction between the north and south, Memphis was a key distributor of goods to towns and cities throughout the region, whilst cotton merchants often served the dual role of selling wholesale supplies to farms and plantations as well, such that wholesaling was one of the largest industries in Memphis and one of its most lucrative. 

In February 1913, he created United Stores, Inc., with 21 retail customers, giving Shanks, Phillips control of wholesale purchasing and advertising. A jointly owned United Store was opened in June 1914. Saunders&#x27; three children, Lee, Clarence Jr., and Amy Carolyn, were born in 1903, 1909 and 1912 respectively.

== Piggly Wiggly ==

On September 6, 1916, Saunders launched the self-service revolution in the United States by opening the first self-service Piggly Wiggly store, at 79 Jefferson Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Saunders had renovated his United Store, removing old countertops, and replacing them with characteristic turnstiles at the entrance and exit, and cabinets arranged along a continuous path, which ended at a cashier stand complete with adding machine and cash register. The store included a front lobby, the continuous-path middle salesroom, and rear stockroom.

The store incorporated shopping baskets, self-service branded products, and checkouts at the front. Removing unnecessary clerks, creating elaborate aisle displays, and rearranging the store to force customers to view all of the merchandise in a continuous path, were just some of the characteristics of the early Piggly Wiggly stores. The store stocked four times the variety of items normally found in an ordinary grocery store, but did not offer fresh meat in the original store. A refrigerator separated two of the aisles, offering butter and cheese. Bins offered fruits and vegetables, while flour and other bulk goods were pre-packaged and placed near the end of the shopper&#x27;s journey through the aisles. The concept of the &quot;Self-Serving Store&quot; patent was filed by Saunders on October 21, 1916, and granted on October 9, 1917 as Patent #1,242,872. Three new patent applications followed, including Patent #1,357,521 for the basic store design. Patent #1,297,405 was filed on February 5, 1918 and granted on March 18, 1919, which covered his means of tagging prices next to the grocery item. He was also granted a patent for his idea of giving shoppers a printed receipt from the adding machine tape.

Saunders then listed Piggly Wiggly shares on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1922. In April of 1922, the company sold 50,000 new shares on the market at $43 a share.

In 1921, there were 615 stores in 200 cities and 40 states. By 1923, Piggly Wiggly had grown into 1,267 stores, 667 owned by the company and the rest owned by franchisees. The company employed 250 people in Memphis. Stock in Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc., paid a dividend of 11%.

The success of Piggly Wiggly encouraged a raft of imitators, including Handy Andy stores, Helpy Selfy stores, Mick-or-Mack stores and Jitney Jungle, all of which operated under patented systems.

== Wall Street raid ==
In the early 1920s Saunders began construction of a pink marble mansion in Memphis. Then, in early 1923, a group of franchised outlets in New York failed. Merrill Lynch(*needs citation) and other speculators on Wall Street attempted a bear raid on the price of Piggly Wiggly stock, gambling the price would fall. With a loan of $10 million from a number of Southern bankers, plus a bit of his own money, Saunders counteracted by buying a large amount of Piggly Wiggly stock in hopes of driving up the price. He flamboyantly declared his intent in newspaper ads. Saunders bought Piggly Wiggly stock until he had orders for 196,000 of the 200,000 outstanding shares. The firm&#x27;s share price went from a low of $39 in late 1922 to $124 by March 20, 1923. Pressured by the &#x27;bears&#x27;, the New York Stock Exchange declared a &#x27;corner&#x27; existed (see cornering the market), and gave the &#x27;bears&#x27; five days rather than the usual 24 hours to deliver the stock Saunders had bought. The additional time meant &quot;a flood of stock poured [in] from distant points and gave the shorts opportunity to deliver.&quot;

In the words of John Brooks, &quot;...in mid-August, with the September 1st deadline for repayment of two and a half million dollars on his loan staring him in the face and with nothing like that amount of cash either on hand or in prospect, he resigned as president of Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc., and turned over his assetshis stock in the company, his Pink Palace, and all the rest of his propertyto his creditors.&quot;

The Pink Palace mansion eventually became Memphis&#x27; first museum in 1930.

== Sole Owner stores ==
In 1928, Saunders went on to create the Clarence Saunders, Sole Owner of My Name Stores, Inc. grocery chain. The chain, which was known to the public as Sole Owner stores, initially flourished. However the chain went into bankruptcy in 1930 during the Great Depression.

== The Tigers football team ==
In the late 1920s, to promote his newest grocery venture, Saunders founded a professional football team. The full name of the team was the Clarence Saunders Sole Owner of My Name Tigers, but it was usually just called The Tigers. The Tigers played professional teams from around the country, including the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers. In 1929, the Tigers beat the Green Bay Packers 20–6. In 1930 the National Football League invited The Tigers to join their organization, but Saunders refused their offer. It is said that Saunders disbanded his football team because he did not like to travel to other cities for away games.

== Keedoozle ==

On November 22, 1935, Saunders chartered the prototype of an automated store. He named it Keedoozle, which some assumed stood for &quot;key does it all&quot;, but Saunders stated was just made up, as was Piggly Wiggly.

The Keedoozle was an automated store, similar to very large vending machine, or Automat. Merchandise was displayed as single units, each within a glass cabinet with a keyhole beneath. Customers entering the store were given a key that they placed in the keyhole below the goods they wished to buy. The quantity desired was determined by the number of times the key was inserted in the slot. This action, recorded the item on punched tape in the key, and automatically moved the item via conveyor belt to the front of the store. Upon reaching the exit gate at the front of the store, an attendant deciphered the customer&#x27;s tape and produced the bill. After payment, the customer&#x27;s groceries were delivered, bagged and wrapped. Pilot stores operated in Memphis and Chicago, but the complex and expensive system could not compete with shopping carts.

Saunders developed two versions of the Keedoozle. The first was in 1937, which was abandoned when the US entered World War II. Saunders returned to the idea in 1948, opening an improved version. Saunders sold twelve franchises of the revised concept. In 1949 he predicted &quot;In five years there will be a thousand Keedoozles throughout the US, selling $5 billion worth of goods.&quot;

== Foodelectric ==
At the time of his death, Saunders was developing plans for another automatic store system called the &quot;Foodelectric&quot;. The Foodelectric concept is a clear predecessor to self checkout. Saunders described it as follows:

The store operates so automatically that the customer can collect her groceries herself, wrap them and act as her own cashier. It eliminates the checkout crush, cuts overhead expenses and enables a small staff to handle a tremendous volume... I can handle a $2 million volume with only eight employees.

The central invention was a primitive computer, or &quot;shopping brain&quot; which was loaned to the shopper, who then roamed among the store&#x27;s glass-enclosed items.

The store, which was to be located two blocks from the first Piggly Wiggly store in downtown Memphis, never opened.

== Personal life ==
Clarence and Carolyn divorced on September 27, 1928, and Clarence married Patricia Houston Bamberg on December 20, 1928.

During World War II, Saunders made toy wagons, baby strollers and broomsticks.

He died in 1953.

== Miscellaneous ==
Saunders was one of the first to use newspaper advertising to campaign for a political candidate, at least in Tennessee. He campaigned for Austin Peay, an acquaintance from his hometown, Clarksville, Tennessee. Peay won in 1922 and gave credit to Saunders&#x27; advertising. When Governor Peay ran for a third term in 1926 (Tennessee governors held office for two-year terms at the time) Saunders inexplicably opposed him, using newspaper ads to denounce his former friend. In 1928 Saunders backed Henry Horton for Governor against Hill McAlister. Memphis political leader E. H. Crump backed McAlister. The candidates were completely overshadowed by the newspaper advertising war waged by Saunders and Crump. Their feud was personal and striking, since few in Memphis had dared challenge Crump, one of the legendary city bosses in American politics. After 1928 Saunders&#x27; fortunes declined, and he did not write political ads again.

<text> (, &quot;The Parliament House&quot;) is a classical 19th-century structure which stands by Austurvöllur in central Reykjavík, Iceland. It houses , the Icelandic parliament. The building was designed by Ferdinand Meldahl and built using hewn Icelandic dolerite from 1880 to 1881.

The reliefs on the tympanums of the four outermost windows on the first floor represent the four landvættir of Iceland: a dragon, a vulture, a giant and a bull, momentarily appeased by Ingólfur Arnarson when he first landed in Iceland.

 has also housed the Icelandic National Library and Antiquaries Collection, and later the Icelandic National Gallery. The University of Iceland used the first floor of the house from 1911 to 1940, and the President of Iceland had his offices in the building until 1973.

Today, only the debating chamber, a few small meeting rooms and the offices of some of the senior parliamentary staff are actually located in . Committee meeting rooms, parliamentarians&#x27; offices and most of Alþingi&#x27;s secretariat are located in other buildings in the area around Austurvöllur. There are currently plans to build a new building to house these offices and meeting rooms in the area immediately to the west of , where there is today a parking lot and a few smaller buildings currently being used by Alþingi and which will be incorporated into the new building.

<text>Exclaim! is a Canadian music and entertainment publisher based in Toronto, which features coverage of new music across all genres with a special focus on Canadian and emerging artists. The monthly &quot;Exclaim!&quot; print magazine publishes seven issues per year, distributing over 103,000 copies to over 2,600 locations across Canada. 

In addition to music, the magazine also covers film and comedy.

==History==
&quot;Exclaim!&quot; began as a discussion among campus and community radio programmers at Ryerson&#x27;s CKLN-FM in 1991. It was started by then-CKLN programmer Ian Danzig, together with other programmers and Toronto musicians. The goal of the publication was to support great Canadian music that was otherwise going unheralded. The group worked through 1991 to produce their first issue in April 1992, with monthly issues being produced since.

Ian Danzig has been the publisher of the magazine since its start. 

The magazine had no official name for its first year of operations, with only the &quot;!☆@#&quot; logo appearing on the cover, and introduced the name &quot;Exclaim!&quot; after Danzig realized that its growth and appeal to advertisers were being limited by a reader tendency to refer to it as &quot;Fuck&quot;.

The magazine is distributed across Canada as a free publication to campuses, community radio stations, bars, concert halls, record stores, cinemas, libraries, coffee shops, convenience stores and street vending boxes. It is also available with a home mail delivery subscription.

Danzig has attributed the magazine&#x27;s survival in part to the fact that the internet ushered in an era of &quot;free culture&quot; in the late 1990s, meaning that the magazine never had to change its existing business model or alienate readers by introducing paywalls.

In 2023, &quot;The Ubyssey&quot;, the student newspaper of the University of British Columbia, parodied &quot;Exclaim!&quot; with a year-end spoof issue titled &quot;Explain!&quot;

==Website==
The magazine&#x27;s website is updated daily with the latest news, reviews, interviews, premieres and features. The site reaches over 675,000 unique users every month. There are also a number of recurring content series, including the monthly the Eh! List Spotify playlist, New Faves emerging artists, the Exclaim! Questionnaire, Music School, Canadian Cannabis Heroes coverage and more.

&quot;Exclaim!&quot; covers film festivals, such as the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), the Sundance Film Festival, Hot Docs Documentary Film Festival, and the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, and publishing interviews with a number of high-profile directors and movie stars. Its comedy section, similarly, focuses on profiles and interviews with established and up-and-coming stand-up comedians. The magazine&#x27;s website also has contests where readers can enter for a chance to win various music, film and apparel prizes.

==Contributors==
Many notable writers have worked for &quot;Exclaim!&quot; over the years, including Canadian radio personality Matt Galloway, Canadian punk chronicler and new media personality Sam Sutherland, hip-hop scribe and CBC Music producer Del Cowie, published author Andrea Warner, Canadian editor at &quot;The FADER&quot; Anupa Mistry, filmmaker Bruce LaBruce, and award-winning DJ and author Denise Benson.

<text>The RT-2PM2 «Topol-M» (, NATO reporting name: SS-27 &quot;Sickle B&quot;, other designations: SS-27 Mod 1, RS-12M1, RS-12M2, formerly incorrectly RT-2UTTKh) is one of the most recent intercontinental ballistic missiles to be deployed by Russia, and the first to be developed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It was developed from the RT-2PM Topol mobile intercontinental ballistic missile.

In its Russian designation РТ stands for &quot;ракета твердотопливная&quot;, raketa tverdotoplivnaya (&quot;solid fuel rocket&quot;), while УТТХ – for &quot;улучшенные тактико-технические характеристики&quot;, uluchshenniye taktiko-tekhnicheskie kharakteristiki (&quot;improved tactical and technical characteristics&quot;). &quot;Topol&quot; (тополь) in Russian means &quot;white poplar&quot;. It is designed and produced exclusively by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology, and built at the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant.

==Characteristics==
The Topol-M is a cold-launched, three-stage, solid-propellant, silo-based or road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile. The missile&#x27;s length is 22.7 meters and the first stage has a body diameter of 1.9 meters. The mass at launch is 47,200 kg, including the 1,200 kg payload. Topol-M carries a single warhead with an 800 kiloton yield but the design is compatible with MIRV warheads. According to chief designer Yury Solomonov, the missile can carry four to six warheads along with decoys. It is claimed to have the highest accuracy of any Russian ICBM. The body of the rocket is made by winding carbon fiber.

The Topol-M may be deployed either inside a reinforced missile silo or from an APU launcher mounted on the MZKT-79221 &quot;Universal&quot; 16-wheeled transporter-erector-launcher. The designation for the silo-based Topol-M missile is believed to be RS-12M2, while the mobile version is RS-12M1.

The first stage has rocket motors developed by the Soyuz Federal Center for Dual-Use Technologies. These give the missile a much higher acceleration than other ICBM types. They enable the missile to accelerate to the speed of 7,320 m/s and to travel a flatter trajectory to distances of up to 10,000 km.

As a solid propellant design, the missile can be maintained on alert for prolonged periods of time and can launch within minutes of being given the order.

==Development and deployment==
The development of the missile began in the late 1980s as a response to the American Strategic Defense Initiative. Initially an evolutionary upgrade of the RT-2PM Topol, the missile was redesigned in 1992. The missile&#x27;s principal designer was Yuri Solomonov, who would later oversee the development of the RSM-56 Bulava.

The first flight test took place on December 20, 1994, during which the missile, launched from Plesetsk, hit its target away. Two missiles were put on experimental combat duty in December 1997 at Tatishchevo. The fifth test flight on 22 October 1998 was unsuccessful as the missile exploded after being launched; the sixth test flight two months later was successful. The 104th Regiment of the Taman Missile Division, based in Saratov, introduced 10 missiles into service on 30 December 1998; another ten entered service with a second regiment in December 1999.

Silo launcher Topol-M entered service by presidential decree on 13 July 2000, the third, fourth and fifth regiments entered service in 2000, 2003 and 2005. The last regiment was to arrive in 2012.

On December 12, 2006, the first three mobile Topol-M missile systems entered duty with a missile unit stationed near the town of Teykovo.

Current Strategic Rocket Forces Order of Battle lists the following sites with Topol-M missiles:
* 27th Guards Rocket Army (HQ: Vladimir)
** 60th Missile Division at Tatishchevo with 60 silo-based Topol-M
** 54th Guards Missile Division at Teykovo with 18 mobile Topol-M

The Topol-M missiles have a lifetime between 15 and 20 years.

==Missile defense evasion capabilities==
According to Russia this missile and its derivatives, RS-24 Yars, RS-26 Rubezh and RSM-56 Bulava are designed to counter and evade current or planned United States missile defense system. It is said to be capable of making evasive maneuvers to avoid a kill by interceptors, and carries targeting countermeasures and decoys.

One of the Topol-M&#x27;s most notable features is its short engine burn time following take-off, intended to minimize satellite detection of launches and thereby complicate both early warning and interception by missile defense systems during boost phase. The missile also has a relatively flat ballistic trajectory, complicating defense acquisition and interception.

According to &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Russia has conducted a successful test of the evasive payload delivery system. The missile was launched on
1 November 2005 from the Kapustin Yar facility. The warhead changed course after separating from the launcher, making it difficult to predict a re-entry trajectory.

==Equipment of Topol-M with MIRV==

A new missile loosely based on Topol-M and equipped with multiple re-entry vehicles (MIRV) is called RS-24 Yars. In January 2009 Russian sources hinted that the production of the mobile Topol-M missile would be shutting down in 2009 and that the new MIRVed RS-24 version would replace it.

==Operators==
;:
The Strategic Missile Troops are the only operator of the RT-2PM2 Topol-M. As of March 2020, 60 silo-based and 18 mobile RT-2PM2 Topol-M missiles are deployed with 2 rocket divisions:

Silo-based:
* 60th Rocket Division at Tatishchevo Air Base
Road-mobile:
* 54th Guards Rocket Division at Teykovo

It is believed that since 2010 no more RT-2PM2 Topol-M missiles have been purchased in favor of the newest RS-24 Yars.

<text>Wolfgang Rihm (; 13 March 1952 – 27 July 2024) was a German composer of contemporary classical music and an academic teacher based in Karlsruhe. He was an influential post-war European composer, as &quot;one of the most original and independent musical voices&quot; there, composing over 500 works including several operas.

The premiere of Rihm&#x27;s &quot;Morphonie&quot; for orchestra at the 1974 Donaueschingen Festival won him international recognition. Rihm pursued a freedom of expression, combining avant-garde techniques with emotional individuality. His chamber opera &quot;Jakob Lenz&quot; was premiered in 1977, exploring the inner conflict of a poet&#x27;s soul. The premiere of his opera &quot;Oedipus&quot; at Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1987 was broadcast live and recorded as DVD. When his opera &quot;Dionysos&quot; was first performed at the Salzburg Festival in 2010, it was voted World Premiere of the Year by &quot;Opernwelt&quot;. He was commissioned to compose a work for the opening of the Elbphilharmonie, and created the song cycle &quot;Reminiszenz&quot; which was premiered in 2017.

Rihm was professor of composition at the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe from 1985, with students including Rebecca Saunders and Jörg Widmann. He was composer in residence for the BBC, at the Lucerne Festival and the Salzburg Festival. He was honoured as an officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2001 and received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 2003.

==Biography==

=== Youth, early work and studies ===
Rihm was born in Karlsruhe on 13 March 1952. His parents were Julius Rihm, a treasurer for the Red Cross, and Margarete, a homemaker. He grew up with a sister, Monika. The boy began to compose at age eleven, and wrote a plan for a mass the following year. He was an enthusiastic choir singer, and he often improvised on the organ, creating &quot;sound orgies&quot; in the style of French organists. His cello sonata earned him a prize at the Jugend musiziert competition at age 16. He wrote his second string quartet at age 18.

At the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe, he studied music theory and composition with while still attending secondary school. He took his undergraduate final exams in 1972, when he graduated from secondary school. He attended the Darmstädter Ferienkurse from 1970 and studied with Karlheinz Stockhausen in Cologne from 1972 to 1973. Rihm then enrolled at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg from 1973 to 1976, studying composition with Klaus Huber and musicology with Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht. His other teachers included Wolfgang Fortner and Humphrey Searle.

=== Initial successes and teaching ===

The premiere of Rihm&#x27;s &quot;Morphonie&quot; at the 1974 Donaueschingen Festival launched his career in the European new music scene. It was regarded as &quot;indecently individual&quot; (). Rihm pursued expressive freedom in clear opposition to established norms. He combined the techniques of then-contemporary classical music with the emotional volatility of Gustav Mahler and the musical expressionism of Arnold Schönberg. Rihm later cited Claude Debussy, saying that Debussy and the expressionist Schönberg combined &quot;minimal formalism and system with the maximal expression&quot;. Many regarded this as a revolt against the early Darmstadt School generation of Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez.

His &quot;Dis-Kontur&quot; (1974) has been described as &quot;rusty and brutal&quot;, &quot;channeling primal acoustic violence&quot;. When &quot;Sub-Kontur&quot; (1975) was premiered in Donaueschingen (1976), the audience complained about Rihm&#x27;s &quot;brutal noise&quot;. Some critics called it a &quot;fecal piece&quot;. But positive reviews of his early work led to many commissions in the following years. His chamber opera &quot;Jakob Lenz&quot; premiered in 1977; it explores the inner conflict of a poet&#x27;s soul without following a linear narrative.

In 1978 he became a lecturer at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse. From 1985 onward, he was a composition professor at the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe, succeeding his teacher Velte. Rihm followed Velte&#x27;s approach of educating in open dialogue with the individual student, cultivating freedom of thought.

His opera &quot;Die Hamletmaschine&quot;, composed between 1983 and 1986 based on Heiner Müller&#x27;s play, &quot;Hamletmachine&quot;, premiered at the Nationaltheater Mannheim in 1987. It was described as a &quot;total theatre of sound&quot; and a &quot;non-narrative, ritualistic drama&quot; reminiscent of Stockhausen. He based the libretto for his opera &quot;Oedipus&quot;, commissioned by Deutsche Oper Berlin on the Greek tragedy by Sophocles and related texts by Friedrich Nietzsche and Heiner Müller. The premiere in October 1987, directed by Götz Friedrich, was broadcast live and recorded as DVD. Rihm&#x27;s work continued in an expressionist vein. However, the influence of Luigi Nono, Helmut Lachenmann, and Morton Feldman, amongst others, affected his style significantly.

=== International successes and honours ===

At Walter Fink&#x27;s invitation, Rihm was the fifth composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1995. The same year, he contributed &quot;Communio (Lux aeterna)&quot; to the Requiem of Reconciliation. The Free University of Berlin awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1998.

In 2003 Rihm received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize, as The New York Philharmonic commissioned and premiered his &quot;Two Other Movements&quot; in 2004. Matthias Rexroth sang his &quot;Kolonos | 2 Fragments by Hölderlin after Sophokles&quot; for countertenor and small orchestra in 2008 at the Bad Wildbad Kurhaus, with Antonino Fogliani conducting the Virtuosi Brunensis.

In March 2010, the BBC Symphony Orchestra featured Rihm&#x27;s music in one of their &#x27;total immersion&#x27; weekends at the Barbican Centre in London. Using recordings from that weekend, BBC Radio 3 dedicated three &quot;Hear and Now&quot; programmed to his work.
On 27 July 2010, his opera &quot;Dionysos&quot; (on Nietzsche&#x27;s late cycle of poems &quot;Dionysian-Dithyrambs&quot;) was premiered at the Salzburg Festival by Ingo Metzmacher with sets designed by Jonathan Meese. In &quot;Opernwelt&quot; magazine, this performance was voted by critics World Premiere of the Year.

The Trio Accanto premiered his &quot;Gegenstück&quot; (2006, 2010) for bass saxophone, percussion, and piano on 16 August 2010, celebrating the 80th birthday of Walter Fink. Anne-Sophie Mutter and the New York Philharmonic premiered his violin concerto &quot;Lichtes Spiel&quot; (&quot;Light Games&quot;) in Avery Fisher Hall on 18 November 2010.

In 2016 Rihm became artistic director of the Lucerne Festival Academy where young musicians, directors and composers are trained in music of the 20th and 21st centuries. On 11 January 2017, the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg was inaugurated with the premiere of &quot;Reminiszenz&quot;, a song cycle for tenor and large orchestra that he composed on a commission for the occasion. Rihm wrote and dedicated &quot;Concerto en Sol&quot; to cellist Sol Gabetta in 2020. It was reviewed as a radiant musical portrait. Among his last works were a Stabat Mater and the song cycle &quot;Terzinen an den Tod&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
Rihm lived in Karlsruhe and Berlin. He was married to Johanna Feldhausen-Rihm; they had a son, Sebastian. The marriage ended in divorce. He married Uta Frank in 1992; they had a daughter, Katja. They separated, and Uta Frank died in 2013. He married Verena Weber in 2017.

His friend, the philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, said in an interview: &quot;In a certain way he was an anti-ascetic character&quot;, taking pleasure in living. About cooking for friends, Sloterdijk said: &quot;There was always a certain level of form and a certain inventive height. He never just cooked a simple recipe. He was always improvising and inventing.&quot;

Rihm was diagnosed with cancer in 2017. He said in an interview in 2020: &quot;Of course, like every person, I&#x27;m physically approaching the end. But I&#x27;m not at the end of my creative energy.&quot;

Rihm died in a hospice in Ettlingen on 27 July 2024, at the age of 72, after battling cancer for many years.

== Compositions and style ==
Rihm composed more than 500 works and was particularly known for his operas. 460 of his works were published, and manuscripts are held by the Paul Sacher Foundation. Despite this productivity, he said he never found composing easy; rather, he was dedicated to his work. Tom Service described Rihm&#x27;s music as comprising a &quot;bewildering variety of styles and sounds&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Jeffrey Arlo Brown described it as a &quot;forceful, shape-shifting&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, his name was associated with the movement called New Simplicity , a term popularized by Aribert Reimann. Writing in 1977, Rihm suggested instead New Multiplicity or New Clarity , since he felt his music was not well described as simple. His music was sometimes also described as Neoromantic.

In the 1980s, Rihm&#x27;s music was newly described as representing &quot;New Subjectivity&quot; or Neo-expressionism, with its &quot;free figuration, emotional pathos, ... and ... clear individualization&quot;, sometimes in relation to contemporaneous art schools like &quot;Junge Wilde&quot; (also known as ) in Germany or the Transavantgarde (also known as or ) in Italy. However, Rihm did not seek to belong to any school and said that such things &quot;must not be looked for&quot; in his music. Nonetheless, Yves Knockaert considered that there were important philosophical and stylistic affinities, especially between Rihm&#x27;s music and the work of Georg Baselitz.

Rihm once said he sought &quot;a new kind of coherence, no longer only restricted to process&quot;. He experimented with &quot;loosening coherence&quot; in his &quot;Notebook Compositions&quot;: the &quot;Musik for drei Streicher&quot; (1977), &quot;Zwischenblick: &quot;Selbsthenker!&quot;&quot; for string quartet (1983–1984), and the String Quartets Nos. 5 and 6. In these, he wrote the music with little, if any, precomposition or revision. Yves Knockaert compared his manner of writing here to the expressionist, but not the dodecaphonic, Schönberg.

Rihm wrote his own libretti, based on the writings of Sophocles, Hölderlin, Nietzsche, Artaud and Müller. Rihm grouped particular themes in cycles, like &quot;Chiffre&quot;, &quot;Vers une symphonie-fleuve&quot;, &quot;Séraphin&quot;, and &quot;Über die Linie&quot;. He also experimented with writing musical fragments, like &quot;Alexanderlieder&quot;, &quot;Lenz-Fragmente&quot;, and &quot;Fetzen&quot; (Scraps).

=== Reception ===
According to &quot;Bachtrack&quot;, Rihm was in 2022 in the Top 10 of the most performed living contemporary composers in the world. He was acclaimed for his independence and continuous self-invention, which Brown said &quot;reinvigorated&quot; contemporary classical music.

<text>Clementi ( , ) is a planning area and residential town located at the easternmost fringe of the West Region of Singapore. The town borders Bukit Batok to the north, Bukit Timah to the northeast, Queenstown to the east and Jurong East to the west.

==Etymology==

&quot;Clementi&quot; derives its name from &#x27;Clementi Road&#x27;, the main traffic route that still runs into the district to this day. It was once known as &#x27;Reformatory Road&#x27; as there was a boys&#x27; home situated along the road. In 1947, the Singapore Rural Board discussed renaming the road. Their original intention was to name it after Sir Hugh Clifford, but it was eventually named as Clementi Road. It is generally suggested that the road was named after Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, who was the first British High Commissioner in the Straits Settlements. However, it is also possible that the road was named after Sir Cecil Clementi, another former Governor of the Straits Settlements (1930–33) who initiated the construction of the Kallang Airport.

==History==
The present area occupying Clementi Avenue 1 used to be known as &#x27;Sussex Estate&#x27;, named after the historic county of Sussex in England. The road running inside Sussex Estate was called Goodwood Road. It was developed in the mid-1950s to house the families of British senior non-commissioned officers. When Clementi underwent a major transformation beginning in 1975, Sussex Estate was the only pre-development feature that was retained. It was demolished in 1997.
Most of the area currently occupied by Clementi New Town today was once a military installation called &#x27;Colombo Camp&#x27;. It is not known when the camp came into existence, however what is known is that the Singapore Guard Regiment, formed in 1948, stationed its troops there. When the regiment disbanded in November 1971, the camp was left to stand for another four more years before it was demolished in 1975.
Clementi New Town was subsequently developed between 1975 and 1979 on the plot of land that was once occupied by the camp. Planned as a self-sufficient residential town with a range of facilities and services, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) began clearing the area in 1974 and affected villagers were resettled.

An iconic landmark at Clementi is the steel truss railway bridge crossing Sungei Ulu Pandan. It was once part of the Jurong KTMB Railway Line which was constructed to facilitate the transportation of manufactured products from Jurong to Malaysia, and raw materials from Malaysia to the industrial estate at Jurong. Construction of the railway began in 1963, and the first train ran in 1966. The Jurong section of the railway remained in use for the next four decades until its closure in the early 1990s. Today, the disused track continues to attract much interest from the public, especially people with a taste for history, nature and photography.

==Geography==
Clementi&#x27;s arterial road, Clementi Road, runs for some 5 kilometres, from the vicinity around Bukit Timah, at Jalan Anak Bukit, to the West Coast Highway, but the geographical entity of Clementi is generally regarded as the area dominated by HDB flats around Commonwealth Avenue West and the Clementi MRT station. Besides Clementi Road, the two other arterial roads that serve the new town are the Ayer Rajah Expressway and the West Coast Highway.

The primary residential district in Clementi is Clementi New Town and forms a large bulk of its residents and identity. The area also consists of many landed properties, especially in the West of the area.

The boundaries of Clementi New Town are Sunset Way Estate to the North, Clementi Road to the East, West Coast Highway to the South, and Clementi Avenue 6 to the West.

===Neighbourhoods===
There are four constituencies in the town, and seven neighbourhoods (N1 to N7) within the Clementi vicinity. Most neighbourhoods are centered around or aligned with their respective neighbourhood hubs, where the majority of commercial activities take place, except for Clementi Town Centre.

=== Subzones ===
There are nine subzones in the planning area; Clementi Central, Clementi North, Clementi West, Clementi Woods, Faber, Pandan, Sunset Way, Toh Tuck and West Coast.

West Coast GRC is led by Minister for Transport, S Iswaran, and Minister for National Development, Desmond Lee.The constituency first faced a challenge from the Workers&#x27; Party in the 1997 general election. Since then, the constituency has received walkovers in both the 2001 and 2006 general elections.

In the 2011 general election, the PAP slate for five-member West Coast GRC, comprising Lim Hng Kiang, S. Iswaran, Arthur Fong, Lawrence Wong Shyun Tsai and Foo Mee Har, faced a contest against the Reform Party led by Kenneth Jeyaretnam.

Currently, West Coast Town Council office is still situated at the Clementi Mall, but it is now meant for residents in Dover, Pandan Gardens, Teban Gardens and West Coast.

==Amenities==
The Commonwealth Cinema on the south side of Clementi MRT station was demolished in 2008 and rebuilt into a four-storey shopping mall, previously named &#x27;CityVibe&#x27;, but later renamed to &#x27;Grantal Mall&#x27;. The former Eng Wah&#x27;s Empress Entertainment Centre Cineplex was also rebuilt and reopened as &#x27;321 Clementi&#x27; in March 2015.

Further from the town centre, a shopping complex, West Coast Plaza, serves the residents along West Coast Road.

In April 2005, the HDB announced plans to build a new mixed-use development at Clementi Town Centre, on the existing bus interchange site. The new development complex was to house a 5-storey retail podium with two basements, two 40-storey residential blocks (Clementi Towers), the West Coast Town Council (Clementi Office), a public library and an air-conditioned bus interchange. On 21 May 2011, The Clementi Mall – the retail shopping mall part of the mixed-use development, officially opened. The mall is linked directly to Clementi MRT station on the third level, and the air-conditioned Clementi Bus Interchange at the first level has direct access to the mall. It is the first development in Singapore to integrate public housing, public transport and commercial facilities built together within a single complex. On 15 May 2012, the mixed development won the prestigious international FIABCI Prix d&#x27;Excellence award, scoring the Runner-up award under the Master Plan Category.

Clementi United Temple, Singapore Buddhist Youth Mission, Ang Chee Sia Ong Temple and Tentera Di-Raja Mosque are some places of worship located in Clementi.

Dover Forest, located just across the Ulu Pandan Rd, is a half-century old secondary regrowth forest embedded in the urban matrix of Ulu Pandan, Singapore. Bounded by three roads and a concrete canal, its 33 hectares consist of western and eastern halves separated by a mowed grass lawn. The forest contains more than 158 animal species, inclusive of critically endangered ones, and 120 plant species. In the Urban Redevelopment Authority Master Plan 2014, the forest was zoned as residential which resulted in Housing and Development Board (HDB) planning to convert forest into a new residential area in 2020. Nature Society (Singapore), as well as other nature groups such as Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity and LepakInSG, raised concerns about the plans for the conversion. Two studies were then conducted by HDB and National Parks Board separately on the biodiversity and connection to nearby forests. The initial plans were then changed to retain the western half of the forest while 11 hectares of the eastern half will be developed into housing use.

==Recreation==
Clementi has a swimming complex and a sports hall for various net or ball sports located near the MRT station. The Clementi Stadium, with a capacity of 4,000 spectators, is located near West Coast Road and can be seen from the Ayer Rajah Expressway.

<doc id="962345" wikidata="Q4855244" url="?curid=962345" title="Bangla Bhai">
<text>Siddique ul-Islam (), known popularly as Azizur Rahman ( in Arabic) or Bangla Bhai () (1970 – 30 March 2007), was a Bangladeshi jihadist and the military commander of the Al Qaeda affiliated radical Islamist organization Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (), known in popular usage as the JMJB. Most active in the north-western section of Bangladesh around the Rajshahi region, Bangla Bhai gained a nationwide and worldwide notoriety for bombings and other terrorist activities.

==Biography==
Bangla Bhai gave an interview to national and local journalist. This interview would be a significant source of information about his life. His father was Nazir Hossain Pramanik of Kannipara village in Gabtoli upazila in Bogra. He claimed to have graduated from Rajshahi University in 1995 with a master&#x27;s in Bangla. The Daily Star reporter contacted the university to verify his claims. The university claimed there was no student with the Azizur Rahman at the Bangla Department in 1995. When the Daily Star reported pointed out this contradiction Bangla Bhai replied: &quot;I studied Bangla at Azizul Haq University College affiliated with Rajshahi University. Bangla Bhai remained private and guarded about his education and background. His senior officer in the organization Amir Maulana Abdur Rahman who was also present during the interview reported that Bangla Bhai studied at Tarafsartaj Senior Fazil Madrasa. Bangla Bhai said regarding his alias &quot;I was a Bangla teacher at two top coaching centres in Dhaka. As my students did well in Bangla, the authorities of coaching centres called me Bangla Bhai, &quot;he did not name the coaching centres or their exact locations. Bangla Bhai also denied certain reports that he was aligned with Bangladesh Chhatra League. &quot;I supported it when I was in school. As a college student, I joined Islami Chhatra Shibir (an Islamist student organisation allied with Jamaat-e-Islami). When I finished my study in 1995, I quit Shibir because Jamaat accepted female leadership although it said it considered female leadership sacrilege.&quot; He joined JMJB (Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh) and rose to the rank of administrator of military affairs and an acting member of the Majlis-e-Sura, its main decision making board of trustees. Bangla Bhai became notorious for the torment and intimidation of the rivals of JMJB and minorities. On 17 August 2005, JMJB, under Islam&#x27;s administration, dispatched an across the nation assault by blasting 500 bombs. Alongside Shaykh Abdur Rahman, Islam is affirmed to have engineered the bombings. In late 2005, a progression of suicide bomb assaults shook Bangladesh. JMJB and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh have asserted obligation of these assaults.

==Militant activity==
*He started operations in the northern Rajshahi locale in 2004 by crusading against neighborhood crooks, purportedly with the assistance of the police and some administration authorities. 
*Taskforce against Torture is a Bangladeshi human rights organization which was founded in 2002. It has recorded more than 500 instances of individuals being threatened and tortured by Bangla Bhai and his associates.
*Abdur Rahman and Bangla Bhai set up organisational bases and militant training camps in madrasas and in remote areas of the country, mostly in the dense forests and hilly areas. They translated their plan into action with the help of huge funds from foreign countries that were meant for building mosques and madrasas.
*August 2005, estimated 500 bombs were detonated in almost every district of Bangladesh except one within one hour. The explosions caused the death of three individuals and injured about 100 individuals.
*In mid-November 2005, two Judges were killed when a bomb was tossed at their vehicle in the town of Jhalalkati, 120 km (75 miles) south of the capital, Dhaka.
*29 November 2005-Seven individuals, including the suspected suicide bomber, died in the attack on Gazipur. This was the first Suicide bomb attack in Bangladesh&#x27;s History. In Chittagong, two police officers were slain the suspected bomber was injured and immobilized. At slightest 16 individuals, 13 of them police officers were injured in Chittagong notwithstanding those murdered.

==Arrest==
The Government of Bangladesh broadcast a reward for the catch of Bangla Bhai or information about his whereabouts, which would supposedly lead to his capture. The Rapid Action Battalion intelligence unit and RAB-9 raced to Mymensingh in the early hours of 6 March 2006 and caught Bangla Bhai&#x27;s wife Fahima and minor child Saad from a house on Ram Krishna Mission Road in Mymensingh town at around 5:00am. Acting on information obtained from his wife, the RAB men commanded by its intelligence wings head Lt Colonel Gulzar Uddin Ahmed encompassed the place of a town Doctor Umed Ali at Rampur in Muktagachha, 30 kilometers off Mymensingh, at around 7:00am and began looking for Bangla Bhai. As RAB Sergeant Rafiq, who was posted in a contiguous tin-roofed house, attempted to peep into the space to see who were inside, Bangla Bhai shot him once in the head. The RAB men were able to remove the sergeant to safety. Two or three minutes after Bangla Bhai assaulted Sergeant Rafiq, an effective bomb went off inside the tin-roofed room where Bangla Bhai was remaining. The blast wrecked the rooftop and an edge of the room caught fire. RAB asked him to surrender, and informed him he was surrounded.

Bangla Bhai exited the house at around 7:30am and surrendered. He showed signs of injury from the blast. Bangla Bhai&#x27;s bodyguard Masud was discovered lying on the floor, he was badly injured from the blast. The entire house was smoldered and just the columns were remained. Injured RAB Sergeant Rafiq was airlifted to Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Dhaka. RAB sources informed the journalists present that three cases would be filed against the terrorist- one under Arms Act, another under Explosives Substance Act and the third for striking the officers.

As the information of Bangla Bhai&#x27;s catch spread, many individuals from close by towns raced to Rampur. The merry group remained on the housetops of houses, trees and both sides of the street as the injured Bangla Bhai was being taken to the hospital. In Mymensingh town, several individuals exited their homes, workplaces and shops to have a look of Bangla Bhai and continued applauding as the RAB men were taking him to the Mymensingh medical college and hospital in a security convoy.

==Death==
Bangla Bhai was given death sentences for the killings of two assistant judges in Jhalakathi. Along with 5 other militants, Bangla Bhai was executed by hanging on 30 March 2007.

==Family==
A Dhaka court on 10 August 2010 sentenced his wife (Fahima pseudonym Farzana) and two JMB men (Salahuddin alias Saleheen and Asaduzzaman Chowdhury alias Panir) to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment each for having explosives. Judge Mohammad Rezaul Islam of the Speedy Trial Tribunal-4 passed on the sentence in vicinity of the convicts.

<doc id="962354" wikidata="Q278128" url="?curid=962354" title="ACAB">
<text>ACAB, an acronym for all cops are bastards, is a political slogan associated with those opposed to the police. It is commonly expressed as a catchphrase in graffiti, tattoos and other forms of imagery in public spaces and online. The slogan is sometimes numerically rendered as 1312, with each digit representing the position of the corresponding letters in the English alphabet.

==Background==
The phrase &quot;all coppers are bastards&quot; first appeared in England in the 1920s, then was abbreviated to &quot;ACAB&quot; by workers on strike in the 1940s. The acronym is historically associated with criminals in the United Kingdom. First reported as a prison tattoo in the 1970s, it is commonly rendered as one letter per finger, or sometimes disguised as a small dot across each knuckle. In 1970, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ran the phrase as a headline, and wrote that it was borne by a Hells Angel on the street. British director Sidney Hayers also used a censored version as the title of his 1972 crime drama &quot;All Coppers Are....&quot; In 1977, a Newcastle journalist saw it written on the walls of a prison cell.

During the 1980s, ACAB became an anti-establishment symbol, especially within the punk and skinhead subcultures. It was popularized in particular by the 1982 song &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; by Oi! band the 4-Skins. In later years, ACAB turned into a popular slogan among European football hooligans and ultras, and among anarchist and anti-authoritarian movements across the world. In certain contexts, the Anti-Defamation League categorizes the phrase as a hate symbol and describes it as &quot;a slogan of long standing in the skinhead culture&quot;, while noting the phrase is used both by racist and anti-racist skinheads.
In the wake of the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by the police officer Derek Chauvin, the use of the term ACAB became more frequently used by those who oppose the police. As protests in response to Floyd&#x27;s murder and discussions about racially-motivated police violence spread through the United States, ACAB was more frequently referenced on social media and products bearing the acronym became available. Proponents of the term contended that ACAB means every single police officer is complicit in an unjust system. They argued that police officers, even if they did not take part in police brutality or racism in policing themselves, were still responsible for what their colleagues did because they did not speak out against it or try to stop it.

==Censorship==

In Germany, usage of the term is a criminal offense when it refers to a single person. It is permitted when used to describe a large group of people. Both &quot;ACAB&quot; and &quot;1312&quot; have been deemed insults by state courts. In 2015, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled in reference to the term &quot;FCK CPS&quot; (read as &#x27;Fuck Cops&#x27;) that an insult is only punishable when it is directed at a specific, identifiable group, but left interpretation of individual cases to the criminal courts.

In Austria, the use of ACAB was seen as &quot;violating public decency&quot;, which could be punished under administrative law, for example, using an administrative penal order. The fine could be up to 700 euros (or alternatively a week police detention). In 2019, the Austrian Constitutional Court (VfGH) ruled that treating the slogan as a violation of decency, in certain cases, violates the fundamental right to freedom of expression under Article 10 ECHR. The specific case involved a soccer fan who had waved an ACAB flag in the stadium. According to the VfGH, the banner should &quot;primarily refer to the tense relationship between some football fans and the police and to express the negative attitude towards the police as part of the state&#x27;s regulatory power&quot; and should therefore &quot;not be a concrete &#x27;insult&#x27; to certain other people&quot;. Therefore, the criticism expressed &quot;should be accepted with a view to the special meaning and function of freedom of expression in a democratic society, taking into account all circumstances of the case&quot;.
In other European countries, there are examples of police action toward people using ACAB in some fashion. Brian Stableford&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Exotic Encounters&quot; states that &quot;many years ago&quot; during a fad for wearing ACAB shirts, a British youth was arrested for incitement to riot for wearing one, and ineffectively claimed the shirt stood for &quot;All Canadians Are Bastards&quot;. In January 2011, three Ajax football fans in the Netherlands were fined for wearing T-shirts with the numbers 1312 printed on them. On 4 July 2015, a woman in Alicante, Spain, was fined for wearing a T-shirt with the acronym &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; printed on it. On 22 May 2016, a 34-year-old woman in Madrid, Spain, was charged under Article 37 of the Citizen Safety Law for carrying a bag displaying the acronym &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; accompanied by the words &quot;All Cats Are Beautiful&quot;. The charges were dropped 3 days later. On 15 September 2017, a man from Karlovac, Croatia posted a photomontage with the message &quot;Fuck da Police A.C.A.B.&quot; from his Facebook profile. For this, he was later charged with violating the public order and fined €100 by the Misdemeanor Court in Karlovac. On 4 April 2019, a 26-year-old ice hockey fan was arrested for wearing a T-shirt that had a numeric version of ACAB, 1312. &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; and &quot;1312&quot; are both considered &quot;extremist information&quot; in Belarus.

Prosecution on the grounds of ACAB being offensive is not limited to Europe. In 2018, a group of Persija Jakarta football fans in Indonesia were arrested for displaying a banner with the message &quot;All Cops Are Bastards&quot; on it during the league match day.

Following a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, 15 protesters were charged with assisting a criminal street gang for using the phrase &quot;all cops are bastards&quot; while wearing black clothes and carrying umbrellas. The police officers who arrested them said the protesters were members of &quot;a group known as ACAB All Cops Are Bastards.&quot; Criminal charges against the protestors were dropped and a probe characterized the case as &quot;deeply flawed&quot;, &quot;insubstantial&quot;, and lacking credible evidence in support of the claim that &quot;ACAB&quot; is a gang.

==In popular culture==
The abbreviation was often used musically in the 1980s. The 4-Skins, a British Oi! punk band, popularized the initialism A.C.A.B. in their 1980s song of the same name. The term has also been used elsewhere in music:
* Austrian band released on their album &quot;Libertatia &quot; (2014) a song with the title &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot;, in which the acronym is interpreted as &quot;All Cats Are Beautiful&quot;
* German punk band Slime released the song &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; on their influential 1979 album &quot;Slime I&quot;; it, along with the band&#x27;s other anti-police songs &quot;are still anthems of the leftist movement&quot; to this day.
* German band in the lyrics of the song &quot;Angst vor Punk&quot;
* German rapper Sun Diego in the song &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; on the album &quot;Planktonweedtape&quot; (2015); in the song &quot;A.C.A.B. II&quot; on the album &quot;Krabbenkoke Tape/SftB&quot; (2017); and in the song &quot;A.C.A.B. III&quot; on the EP &quot;Planktonweed EP&quot; (2022)
* German satirist Jan Böhmermann with his song &quot;Ich hab Polizei&quot; (2015), but negating it by adding an &quot;N&quot; in front.
* American band the Casualties in their song &quot;1312&quot;, the lead single from their 2018 album &quot;Written in Blood&quot;.

The 2012 Italian drama film &quot;ACAB – All Cops Are Bastards&quot; follows the work of a group of riot control force policemen and tensions within the community.

<text>The Jeju uprising, known in South Korea as the Jeju April 3 incident (), was an uprising on Jeju Island from April 1948 to May 1949. A year prior to its start, residents of Jeju had begun protesting elections scheduled by the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to be held in the United States-occupied half of Korea, which they believed would entrench the division of the country. A general strike was later organized by the Workers&#x27; Party of South Korea (WPSK) from February to March 1948. The WPSK launched an insurgency in April 1948, attacking police and Northwest Youth League members stationed on Jeju who had been mobilized to suppress the protests by force. The First Republic of Korea under President Syngman Rhee escalated the suppression of the uprising from August 1948, declaring martial law in November and beginning an &quot;eradication campaign&quot; against rebel forces in the rural areas of Jeju in March 1949, defeating them within two months. This resulting campaign has led to the event being called the Jeju [[Massacre|massacre]]. Many rebel veterans and suspected sympathizers were later killed upon the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, and the existence of the Jeju uprising was officially censored and repressed in South Korea for several decades.

The Jeju uprising and its repression were notable for its extreme violence; between 14,000 and 30,000 people (10 percent of Jeju&#x27;s population) were killed, and 40,000 fled to Japan. Other estimates reach as high as 80,000 dead. Atrocities and war crimes were committed by both sides, but historians have noted that the methods used by the South Korean government to suppress protesters and rebels were especially cruel, with violence against civilians by pro-government forces giving rise to the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion in South Jeolla during the conflict. Some historians and scholars, including military historian Allan R. Millett, regard the Jeju uprising as the true beginning of the Korean War.

In October 2003, the National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident chaired by South Korean prime minister Goh Kun released a comprehensive report detailing the violence that occurred during the uprising, and South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun issued an official apology on behalf of the South Korean government. In 2019, the South Korean police and the defense ministry apologized for their involvement in the massacres during the Jeju uprising.

==Background==
===Political situation in Korea===
After Imperial Japan surrendered to Allied forces on August 15, 1945, the 35-year Japanese occupation of Korea ended. Korea was subsequently divided along the 38th parallel, with the Soviet Union overseeing the north and the United States the south. In September 1945, Lt. General John R. Hodge established a military government to administer the southern region, including Jeju Island. In December 1945, representatives from the US, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom met to discuss a joint trusteeship. However, a lack of consensus led the US to bring the &quot;Korean question&quot; to the United Nations. On November 14, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 112, calling for a general election in Korea on May 10, 1948, under the supervision of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea.

Fearing a loss of influence over northern Korea, the Soviet Union rejected the UN resolution and barred UNTCOK from entering the region. The UNTCOK nevertheless proceeded with the elections, albeit only in the southern half of the peninsula. In response, the Soviet Union organized its own elections in the north on August 25, 1948.

===Political situation on Jeju Island===
Residents of Jeju island were some of the most active participants in the Korean independence movement against colonial Japanese occupation. Due to the island&#x27;s relative isolation from the mainland peninsula, Jeju experienced relative peace after the Japanese surrender, contrasting with the period of heavy unrest in the southern region of mainland Korea. As with the mainland, the period immediately following the Japanese surrender was characterized by the formation of People&#x27;s Committees, local autonomous councils tasked with coordinating the transition towards Korean independence. When the American military government arrived on Jeju in late 1945, the Jeju People&#x27;s Council was the only existing government on the island. As a testament to this relative stability, the US military governor under the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) John R. Hodge stated in October 1947 that Jeju was &quot;a truly communal area that is peacefully controlled by the People&#x27;s Committee without much Comintern influence.&quot;

The Jeju People&#x27;s Committee had come under the directive of the Workers&#x27; Party of South Korea (WPSK) by late 1946. The WPSK encouraged the People&#x27;s Council to establish military and political committees, as well as mass organizations. The 1946 USAMGIK dissolution of the provisional People&#x27;s Republic of Korea and their associated People&#x27;s Committees on the mainland sparked the Autumn Uprising of 1946, which did not spread to Jeju (as its PC still operated virtually undisturbed by the American military government) but did contribute to rising tensions on the island. However, since the 2000s, many South Korean liberal scholars and bereaved families of the victims of the massacre have evaluated that the Jeju People&#x27;s Committee has nothing to do with directive of the WPSK.

==Incidents leading up to the uprising==
=== Sam-il demonstrations ===
Residents of Jeju began protesting against the elections a year before they took place. Particularly concerned about permanently dividing the peninsula, the WPSK planned gatherings on March 1, 1947, to denounce the elections and simultaneously celebrate the anniversary of the March 1st Movement (also known as the Sam-il Movement). An attempt by the security forces to disperse the crowds only brought more citizens of Jeju out in support of the demonstrations. The police fired indiscriminately into the crowd, killing six civilians, including a six-year-old child.

=== Chong-myon jail incident ===
On March 8, 1947, a crowd of about a thousand demonstrators gathered at the Chong-myon jail, demanding the release of WPSK members the military government had arrested during the Sam-il demonstrations. When the demonstrators started throwing rocks and subsequently rushed the jail, the police inside shot at them, killing five. In response, WPSK members and others called on the military government to take action against the police officers who fired on the crowd. Instead, 400 more police officers were flown in from the mainland, along with members of an extreme right-wing paramilitary group known as the Northwest Youth League. Although both the police and paramilitary groups employed violent and harsh tactics in their suppression of the locals, the Northwest Youth League was especially ruthless, described as borderline terroristic.

=== February 1948 general strike ===
As the May 10, 1948 elections approached, WPSK leaders hardened in their opposition to the involvement of UNTCOK in Korean affairs, as they believed the elections would formalize the 38th parallel partition as a border, rendering a unified, independent Korea much less likely. In January 1948, Pak Hon-yong, the leader of the WPSK, called on WPSK members south of the 38th parallel to oppose the elections by whatever means necessary, and called for a general strike to begin on February 7. At this point, there were at least 60,000 members of the WPSK on Jeju, and at least 80,000 active supporters. These members and supporters not only went on strike but in some cases attacked government installations and engaged with police forces in open conflict. These engagements between WPSK guerrillas against rightist groups and police continued through March 1948.

==Rebellion==
=== April 3, 1948 ===

Although skirmishes had been taking place on Jeju Island since early 1947, April 3, 1948, is considered as the day the Jeju uprising officially began. Some sources claim it came about when military police &quot;fired on a demonstration commemorating the Korean struggle against Japanese rule,&quot; igniting mass insurrection. Other sources, however, make no mention of this demonstration incident, and claim that WPSK plans to attack on April 3 had been in the works for some time. Whatever the case, at approximately 02:00, around 500 WPSK guerrillas alongside up to 3,000 sympathizers attacked Northwest Youth League positions as well as 11 of the 24 police stations on the island, killing 30 police officers, specifically targeting those who were known to have previously collaborated with the Japanese.

Lieutenant General Kim Ik-ryeol, commander of police forces on the island, attempted to end the insurrection peacefully by negotiating with the rebels. He met several times with rebel leader Kim Dal-sam of the WPSK but neither side could agree on conditions. The government wanted a complete surrender and the rebels demanded disarmament of the local police, dismissal of all governing officials on the island, prohibition of paramilitary groups, and the re-unification and liberation of the Korean peninsula.

In the wake of these failed peace negotiations, the fighting continued. The US military government responded to guerrilla activity by transferring another regiment to Jeju from Busan and deploying police companies, each 1,700 strong, from the southern provinces of the mainland. The guerrillas retreated to their bases in the forests and caves around Hallasan, Jeju&#x27;s central volcano and the highest mountain in South Korea. On April 29, the Korean, non-military, governor of Jeju province abandoned his post, defected, and joined the guerrillas. This caused many police officers, disillusioned by the atrocities they were ordered to commit against their own, to do the same. In response, US military provincial governor William F. Dean ordered a purge of WPSK sympathizers from the ranks of the Korean constabulary, and three sergeants were summarily executed.

Fighting continued through the May 10 elections. A total of 214 people had been killed by then. During election week, the guerrillas &quot;cut telephone lines, destroyed bridges, and blocked roads with piles of stones to disrupt communications.&quot; The WPSK Women&#x27;s League campaigned for residents to hide in the mountainous region controlled by guerillas the night before the election so they could not be brought out to vote at gunpoint, and thousands did. Many election officials even declined to show up. These campaigns, along with sporadic arson, violent demonstrations and attacks on three government installations on election day rendered the election useless. The turnout in Jeju was the lowest in all of South Korea, so low that the two seats reserved for Jeju province in the new national assembly were left vacant.

Fearing an upsurge in guerrilla activities after they succeeded in getting what they wanted out of the election, General Dean requested a US Navy blockade of the island on May 11, so that sympathizers from the mainland could not reach Jeju. The Navy sent the to enforce the blockade.

=== August 1948 underground elections and Yeosu rebellion ===
Although guerrilla activities waned during the summer months of 1948, they picked up again in August after the Soviet Union held elections north of the 38th parallel to form the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK). In conjunction with these elections, the Workers&#x27; Party of North Korea (WPNK) organized &quot;underground elections&quot; for those wanting to participate south of the 38th parallel, including on Jeju Island. Although the turnout of these elections is disputed, they succeeded at emboldening WPSK military forces. In the months following the elections, conditions worsened to the point that Republic of Korea (ROK) officials decided to send the Fourteenth Regiment of the Korean Constabulary, stationed near the southern port city of Yeosu, to Jeju Island to assist counter-guerrilla efforts. Not wanting to &quot;murder the people of Jeju,&quot; however, thousands of these troops mutinied on October 20, 1948, just as they were preparing to depart. They killed many of the high-ranking officers and former Japanese collaborators and seized Yeosu and surrounding areas before retreating into the areas around Jirisan mountain and setting up guerrilla bases, much as the Jeju guerrillas did while hiding out in Hallasan. Embarrassed by this incident, Syngman Rhee, the newly elected president of the ROK, intensified the government&#x27;s efforts to stamp out the rebellion. On November 17, 1948, Syngman Rhee proclaimed martial law in order to quell the rebellion. During this period, ROK police forces engaged in numerous war crimes. One report describes the events of December 14, 1948 at a small Jeju village, in which ROK forces attacked the village and kidnapped many young men and girls. The girls were gang-raped over a two-week period and were then executed along with the young men.

By the end of 1948, the ROK&#x27;s harsh tactics and effective suppression campaigns had reduced the number of guerrilla forces to just 300.

=== WPSK&#x27;s 1949 New Year offensive and the ROK&#x27;s eradication campaign ===
On January 1, 1949, the guerrillas launched one last offensive against ROK police. They attacked at Odong-ni and Jeju City, but were beaten back by ROK police and driven to the island&#x27;s interior mountains. ROK police pursued the guerrillas and continued to commit atrocities, including rounding up whole villages and killing them all. The ROK forces, now determined to destroy the remaining WPSK guerrillas, launched an eradication campaign in March 1949. During the campaign, 2,345 guerrillas and 1,668 civilians were killed. With the campaign now effectively over, the ROK held elections on Jeju Island to fill the province&#x27;s empty seats in the National Assembly; Jeju Island was now effectively and symbolically under ROK jurisdiction.

==United States involvement==
At the beginning of the uprising, the island was controlled by the United States Army Military Government in Korea.

Only a small number of Americans were present. Jimmie Leach, a captain in the US Army, was an adviser to the South Korean Constabulary and claimed that there were six Americans on the island, including himself, and that they could call on two small L-4 scout planes and two old minesweepers converted to coastal cutters, manned by Korean crews. On March 8, 1949, the US Armed Forces sent an investigation team headed by Colonel James A. Casteel to Jeju to investigate the causes of the rebellion. They summarized that the February 1948 Jeju general strike prior to the rebellion was caused by instigation by the WPSK and hostility towards the police as a result of shootings. They also described the strike as &quot;communist inspired&quot; but participated by both the left and right in response to the March 1 shootings.
By the spring of 1949 four South Korean Army battalions arrived and joined the local constabulary, police forces, and right-wing Northwest Youth Association partisans to suppress protests. The combined forces quickly destroyed or disabled most of the remaining rebel forces. On June 7, 1949, the leadership of the movement fell apart following the killing of major rebel leader Lee Deok-gu. The US military later called the complete destruction of Jungsangan village a &quot;successful operation.&quot;
The National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident concluded that the US Army Military Government in Korea and the Korean Military Advisory Group shared responsibility for the incident as it began under the rule of the military government and an American colonel was in charge of the security forces of Jeju until August 1948. According to Heo Hojun&#x27;s(허호준), US liaison aircraft helped to arrest and kill villagers who evacuated to middle mountain area. Song Yo Chan(송요찬) commander of punitive forces in Jeju during late 1948, show appreciation to Fred M. Erricson who helped punitive operation and noticed the rally point, command post of Rebel forces and battle situation between Rebel and Punitive forces by reconnaissance flight.

After the outbreak of the Korean War, the US assumed command of the South Korean armed forces. Brigadier General William Lynn Roberts commanded Americans on Jeju.

The US military documented massacres but did not intervene. On May 13, 1949, the US ambassador to South Korea wired Washington that the Jeju rebels and their sympathizers had been, &quot;killed, captured, or converted.&quot; &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; reported on the South Korean Army&#x27;s suppression of the rebellion, local support for the rebels, as well as rebel retaliation against local rightist opponents.

==Korean War==
Immediately after the North Korean invasion of South Korea, the South Korean military ordered the &quot;preemptive apprehension&quot; of suspected leftists nationwide. Thousands were detained on Jeju and then sorted into four groups, labeled A, B, C and D, based on the perceived security risks each posed. On August 30, 1950, a written order by a senior intelligence officer in the South Korean Navy instructed Jeju&#x27;s police to &quot;execute all those in groups C and D by firing squad no later than September 6.&quot;

==Aftermath==
In one of its first official acts, the South Korean National Assembly passed the National Traitors Act in 1948, which among other measures, outlawed the Workers Party of South Korea. For almost fifty years after the uprising, it was a crime punishable by beatings, torture, and a lengthy prison sentence if any South Korean even mentioned the events of the Jeju uprising. The event had been largely ignored by the government. In 1992, President Roh Tae Woo&#x27;s government sealed up a cave on Mount Halla, where the remains of massacre victims had been discovered. After civil rule was reinstated in the 1990s, the government admitted that the events on Jeju Island had taken place.

In 2003, the National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident chaired by South Korean prime minister Goh Kun described the event as a genocide. In October 2003, President Roh Moo-hyun apologized to the populace of Jeju for the brutal suppression of the uprising: &quot;Due to wrongful decisions of the government, many innocent people of Jeju suffered many casualties and destruction of their homes.&quot; In March 2009, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission revealed, &quot;At least 20,000 people jailed for taking part in the popular uprisings in Jeju, Yeosu and Suncheon, accused of being communists, were massacred in some 20 prisons across the country,&quot; when the Korean War broke out.

The commission reported 14,373 victims during the uprising, 86 percent at the hands of the security forces and 14 percent at the hands of armed rebels, and estimated that the total death toll was as high as 30,000. The commission listed the number of confirmed deaths at each stage of the incident; 104 deaths from March 3, 1947 to April 4, 1948; 214 deaths during the initial armed uprising from April 4 to May 10; and 637 deaths during armed conflict from May 11 to October 10. The most violent period was from October 11, 1948 to March 1, 1949, with 9,709 confirmed deaths. There were a further 2,668 confirmed deaths between March 3, 1949 and June 24, 1950. 800 more deaths occurred on Jeju up to 21 September 1954. The commission confirmed 7,624 victims of the security forces, and 1,528 victims of the armed rebels. Further, they confirmed 448 victims of systematic civilian massacres.

Some 70 percent of the island&#x27;s 230 villages were burned to the ground, and over 39,000 houses were destroyed. Of the 400 villages before the uprising only 170 remained afterwards. In 2008, bodies of massacre victims were discovered in a mass grave near Jeju International Airport. Estimates of the overall deaths of the 1948–1950 uprising run as high as 100,000.

In January 2019, the Jeju District Court overturned military court rulings that imprisoned Jeju Islanders, clearing the names of the 18 surviving plaintiffs and recognizing them as wronged victims of the Jeju April 3 Uprising and Massacre. At the 71st commemoration of Jeju uprising, April 3, 2019, the South Korean police and defense ministry apologized for the first time over the massacres.

==Controversies==
===Effort of truth ascertainment===
Families of victims of the uprising and associated massacres, as well as various civic organizations, continuously attempted to openly discuss the uprising but the national government suppressed all materials and discussions, and even made the topic of the uprising illegal. The first published recollection in South Korea of the massacre was the 1978 novel &quot;Sun-i Samch&#x27;on&quot; (, &quot;Uncle Suni&quot;) which is set during the event. However, it was swiftly banned by the ROK government and its author, Hyun Ki-young, was arrested and tortured for three days by the National Intelligence Service.

However, on November 23, 1998, after the democratization of South Korea, President Kim Dae-jung stated that &quot;the Jeju uprising was a communist rebellion, but there are a lot of people who died under false accusations as innocents, so now we have to reveal the truth and clear their false charges.&quot; On December 26, 1999, the National Assembly passed a bill, &#x27;A special law for the Jeju uprising truth ascertainment and the regaining impaired reputation of the victims&#x27;. On January 12, 2000, the National Assembly legislated a law so the Korean government could begin conducting an investigation of the uprising. Due to this decision, it could be possible to expand the human rights of the residents of Jeju. On October 15, 2003, a truth ascertainment committee of the Jeju uprising was assembled according to the special law, and ascertained a fact-finding report of the Jeju uprising. In line with the finding of the committee, on October 31, 2003, former president Roh Moo-hyeon admitted that the brutal suppression of the uprising was a massive abuse of governmental power and made a public apology to the people of Jeju on behalf of the Republic of Korea. On the 71st anniversary of the event, the defense ministry and police under the Moon Jae-in administration apologized for the past government&#x27;s role in the Jeju massacre.

===Causes===

Some right-wing groups, including the Wallganjosun (), and Jaehyanggooninhwe () argued that the Jeju uprising was led and instigated by the WPSK.

Kim Gwang-dong, the director of researching policy in Korea argued that though the fundamental characteristic of the uprising was &quot;subversion of the system,&quot; there were many skewed and biased studies that criticized the Korean government&#x27;s faults in suppressing the rebellion. He said that &quot;it was an armed struggle and revolt of the forces who advocate communism against forces who support liberal democracy.&quot;

A Presbyterian minister, Lee Jong-yoon, said at a church in Seoul that &quot;the Jeju rising was incurred by the leftist forces and they provoked the rebellion to disturb the May 10 general election.&quot; The statement was broadcast through the CTS channel.

On November 20, 2010, a chairman of an adjustment committee of past affairs and a former new right, Lee Young-Jo argued that the &quot;Jeju rising was apparent communist-led rebellion.&quot;

===Legality of martial law===
There are controversies about the legality of martial law, which took effect on November 17, 1948. One side believes it was illegal according to the first constitution of South Korea. The other side argues that martial law from the Japanese colonial era still existed and therefore permitted any violence effectuating martial law. This part continued before August 15, 1948, and after the formation of the South Korean government.

===Post-processing and debating the case===
Although the June, 2000 incident report stated that 14,028 victims were found, it is very likely that the number was higher since there are both unidentified or unidentifiable victims. In addition, about 180 soldiers died in combat, and 140 policemen died in the April 3 incident.

In 2003, South Korea&#x27;s National Committee for the Investigation of the Truth concluded that the US Army military government and the Korean military shared responsibility for the incident. On October 31, 2003, South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun offered an apology to the victims of the Jeju incident. On March 28, 2008, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology opened a chemical aid project in Bonggae-dong, Jeju as part of a joint compensation program for the Jeju April 3 incident.

In January 2019, 18 survivors, who were formally charged with insurrection, were acquitted more than 70 years after their imprisonment. The Jeju District Court overturned military court rulings that imprisoned Jeju Islanders, clearing the names of the 18 surviving plaintiffs and recognizing them as wronged victims of the Jeju April 3 Uprising and Massacre. At the 71st commemoration of Jeju uprising, April 3, 2019, the South Korean police and defense ministry apologized for the first time over the massacres.

===Controversy over the United States responsibility===
Many South Korean human rights activists and bereaved families of the victims of the massacre argue that the killings were systematically carried out by USAMGIK and South Korean anti-communist right-wing political forces. Therefore, they argue that the United States should apologize for this. According to them, the US president should visit Jeju Island, and the US should officially admit responsibility for the Jeju massacre.

==In popular media==
* &quot;Jiseul&quot; is a 2012 South Korean film about Jeju residents during the uprising.
* Zainichi Korean writer Kim Sok-pom wrote a novel titled &quot;Kazantō&quot; (&quot;Volcanic Island&quot;) about the event; his work is seen as controversial in South Korea and he has been denied entry to the country twice (in 1980 and 2015).
* &quot;The Southern Province That Doesn&#x27;t Sleep&quot; (, often shortened to ) is a popular Korean song with words and music by Ahn Chi Hwan. This song contains the agony of the victims of Jeju uprising. In 2013, the Soreyu choir from Tokyo, Japan sang this song. A choir member of the Soreyu, Saito Gathuki said, &quot;Years ago, I recognized the 4.3 affair through the documentary of NHK. Because I am in a generation before war, I couldn&#x27;t know about the war and Korea. But now, I get to know the tragedy of war and massacre since I visit [Jeju].&quot;
* &quot;The Island of Sea Women&quot; by Lisa See is set on Jeju Island, beginning during a period of Japanese colonialism in the 1930s, followed by World War II, the Korean War, and its aftermath, including great detail of the Jeju uprising.
* &quot;Impossible Goodbyes&quot; (English Translation title &quot;We Do Not Part&quot;) by Han Kang prominently features Jeju Island and the massacre.

<text>Safri Duo is a Danish electronic percussion duo composed of Uffe Savery (born 5 April 1966) and Morten Friis (born 21 August 1968). Initially classically oriented, they later made a track mixing both tribal sound and modern electronica. Released in 2000, &quot;Played-A-Live (The Bongo Song)&quot;, became one of the most popular songs in Europe in 2001. The single and subsequent album, &quot;Episode II&quot; each sold one million units worldwide, making Safri Duo the most internationally successful Danish act since Aqua.

==History==
===Early years===
Uffe Savery and Morten Friis met in 1977 while attending the Tivoli Garden Boys&#x27; Guard, and later, during their time at the Royal Danish Conservatory of Music, formed an experimental duo, called Safri Duo, whose name originated from the first letters of their respective surnames. Several albums were recorded and released through Chandos Records, on which the duo performed pieces by both famous classical (e.g. Bach, Mendelssohn, Ravel, whose works were arranged by Savery and Friis for two marimbas, or for marimba and vibraphone) and contemporary composers (a.o. Reich, Nørgård, Ter Veldhuis). Their performances of, especially, Ter Veldhuis&#x27; &quot;Goldrush&quot;, Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot; and Anders Koppel&#x27;s &quot;Toccata for vibraphone and marimba&quot; are often labelled as small milestones by fellow percussionists, as well as other musicians or people related to the world of classical music.

===Mainstream success===
Earlier in 2000, a track named &quot;The Bongo Song&quot; started appearing on clubs&#x27; playlists. Produced by Michael Parsberg, it soon got airtime on MTV Europe. The mix between tribal drums over trance proved to be a success, and it ended the year as one of the best selling singles in Europe in 2000 as well as featuring prominently in the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. This resulted in Safri Duo guesting along with Danish pop group Aqua during the interval of the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 held in Copenhagen. &quot;The Bongo Song&quot; was featured prominently during the 2002 Commonwealth Games held in Manchester, England as well as the soundtrack of FIFA Football 2003. The album, named &quot;Episode II&quot;, hit the market on 4 June 2001, nine tracks long, all featured the same percussion-electronica combination, except &quot;Adagio&quot; that kept the former classic line of the duo. A reissue added a second remix-only CD and the single &quot;Sweet Freedom&quot; recorded with Michael McDonald was released on 30 September 2002 (also &quot;Everything&quot; appeared in this CD Single as a B-Side). Two more tracks from &quot;Episode II&quot; were released as singles, &quot;Samb-Adagio&quot; and &quot;Baya Baya&quot;. The Bongo Song became the anthem of the world-famous Coco Bongo super club in Cancún, where it is the party opening song every night.

===&quot;3.0&quot;===
In 2003, the new album &quot;3.0&quot; was released. It features Clark Anderson as vocalist on several of the tracks, including &quot;All the People in the World&quot;, &quot;Agogo Mosse&quot; and &quot;Laarbasses&quot;. The track &quot;Rise&quot; was later released in a new version titled &quot;Rise (Leave Me Alone)&quot; which features Anderson on vocals. In 2004, the duo released a remix album of &quot;3.0&quot; titled &quot;3.5 (3.0 The Remix Edition)&quot;. It includes &quot;Rise (Leave Me Alone)&quot; and several other tracks with Anderson as vocalist and remixes of several tracks from &quot;3.0&quot;. They also played in the concert of Jean-Michel Jarre (AERO Concert) on his song &quot;Rendez-Vous 4&quot;.

===Origins===
Safri Duo&#x27;s latest album &quot;Origins&quot; was released on 17 November 2008.

<text>Black separatism is a race-based separatist political movement that seeks separate economic and cultural development for people of sub-Saharan African descent in societies, particularly in the United States. Black separatism stems from the idea of racial solidarity, and it also implies that black people should organize themselves on the basis of their common skin color, their race, culture, and African heritage. There were a total of 255 black separatist groups recorded in the United States as of 2019.

Black separatism in its purest form asserts that black people and white people ideally should form two independent nations. Additionally, black separatists often seek to return to their original cultural homeland of Africa. This sentiment was spearheaded by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association in the 1920s. Black separatists generally think that black people are hindered in a white-dominated society.

==Concepts==
In his discussion of black nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the historian Wilson Jeremiah Moses observes that &quot;black separatism, or self-containment, which in its extreme form advocated the perpetual physical separation of the races, usually referred only to a simple institutional separatism, or the desire to see black people making independent efforts to sustain themselves in a proven hostile environment.&quot;

Scholars Talmadge Anderson and James Stewart further make a distinction between the &quot;classical version of Black separatism advocated by Booker T. Washington&quot; and &quot;modern separatist ideology&quot;. They observe that &quot;Washington&#x27;s accommodationist advice&quot; at the end of the nineteenth century &quot;was for Blacks not to agitate for social, intellectual, and professional equality with Whites&quot;. By contrast, they observe, &quot;contemporary separatists exhort Blacks not only to equal Whites but to surpass them as a tribute to and redemption of their African heritage.&quot; Anderson and Stewart add, moreover, that in general &quot;modern black separatism is difficult to define because of its similarity to black nationalism.&quot;

Indeed, black separatism&#x27;s specific goals were historically in flux and they also varied from group to group. Martin Delany in the 19th century and Marcus Garvey in the 1920s outspokenly called for African Americans to return to Africa, by moving to Liberia. Benjamin &quot;Pap&quot; Singleton looked to form separatist colonies in the American West. The Nation of Islam calls for several independent black states on American soil. More mainstream views within black separatism hold that black people would be better served by schools and businesses that are exclusively for black people, as well as by local black politicians and police.

=== Similarity to black nationalism ===
There are similarities between black nationalism and black separatism, mainly that they both advocate for the civil rights of black people. There are a few differences between them, however. Black separatists believe that black people should be physically separated from other races, primarily whites; black separatists would for example want a separate nation for black people. Examples of black separatist organizations include the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party.

This is slightly different from black nationalists because black nationalists do not always believe in a physical separation of black people. In some form, black nationalists do believe in separation, but not physical separation. Black nationalists focus more on Black pride, justice, and identity. Their belief is that black people should be proud of their own skin, heritage, and beauty. They also believe that there should be justice for black people, especially in the United States.

== Usage by the Southern Poverty Law Center ==
The term &quot;Black separatism&quot; has been used by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an American civil rights advocacy group, to categorize several groups in the United States promoting antisemitic, anti-LGBTQ and male supremacist views.
However, in October 2020, the SPLC announced that they would no longer use the category of &quot;Black separatism&quot;, saying this was done to avoid creating a false equivalence between Black separatism and White supremacist extremism.

<text>This article describes the history of Yunnan (Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau), currently a province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Prehistory==
Notable prehistoric finds include the Yuanmou Man, a &quot;Homo erectus&quot; fossil unearthed by railway engineers in the 1960s and determined to be the oldest known hominid fossil in China.

==Neolithic==
By the Neolithic period, human settlements existed in the area of Lake Dian, close to modern-day Kunming, Yunnan&#x27;s capital. The inhabitants used stone tools and constructed simple wooden structures.

==The Kingdom of Dian==
The Dian culture was distributed around the Lake Dian area and dated, though controversially, between the 6th century BC and the 1st century AD. The culture is divided into an early and a late phase. Under Emperor Wu, a series of military campaigns were dispatched against the Dian during the southward expansion of the Han dynasty. In 109 BC, the kingdom officially became a vassal state of the Han empire.

== Han dynasty ==

In 109 BC, Emperor Wu sent General Guo Chang () south to Yunnan, establishing the Yizhou commandery. The commandery seat was at Dianchi county (present day Jinning). To expand the burgeoning trade with Burma and India, Emperor Wu also sent Tang Meng () to maintain and expand the Five Foot Way, renaming it &quot;Southwest Barbarian Circuit&quot; (). By this time, agricultural technology in Yunnan had markedly improved. The local people used bronze tools, plows and kept a variety of livestock, including cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs. They lived in tribal congregations, sometimes led by exile Chinese.

In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC) and Sima Qian (145-90 BC) make references to &quot;Sendhuk&quot;, which may have been referring to an Indianised community taking the name from the Indus Valley (the Sindh province in modern Pakistan), originally known as &quot;Sindhu&quot; in Sanskrit. When Yunnan was annexed by the Han dynasty, Chinese authorities also reported a Sendhuk&quot; (Indianised) community living in the area.

In 109 AD, the Han court established Yunnan county, a part of Yizhou () commandery. Because the county seat was south of Mount Yun (), the county was named &quot;Yunnan&quot; – literally &quot;south of Yun&quot;.

==Jin dynasty and the Northern and Southern dynasties period==
Chinese dynasties of Jin, Liu Song, Southern Qi and Northern Zhou maintain their rules around the commandery in the Kunming area. Southwest Yunnan and the eastern rugged, mountainous areas were still enjoying relative independence, ruled by tribal kings and chieftains with little Chinese influence.

== Nanzhao Kingdom ==

In 649 AD the chieftain of the Yi Mengshe tribe, Xinuluo (), founded a kingdom () in the area of Lake Erhai. In the year AD 737, Piluoge () united the six zhaos in succession, establishing a new kingdom called Nanzhao.

In 750, Nanzhao invaded the Tang dynasty. In retaliation, the Tang sent an army against Nanzhao in 751, but this army was soundly defeated at Xiaguan. In 754, another army was sent, this time from the north, but it too was defeated. Bolstered by these successes, Nanzhao expanded rapidly, first into Burma, then into the rest of Yunnan, down into northern Laos and Thailand, and finally, north into Sichuan. In 829, Chengdu was taken; it was a great prize, as it enabled Nanzhao to lay claim to the whole of Sichuan province, with its rich paddy fields.

The Tang dynasty retaliated and by 873, Nanzhao had been expelled from Sichuan, and retreated back to Yunnan. Taking Chengdu marked the high point of the Nanzhao kingdom, and it was a watershed: from then on, the Nanzhao Kingdom slowly declined. n 902, the Nanzhao dynasty was overthrown, and it was followed by three other dynasties in quick succession, until Duan Siping seized power in 937 to establish the Kingdom of Dali.

== Dali Kingdom ==

Dali was a Buddhist Bai kingdom. Established by Duan Siping in 937, it was ruled by a succession of 22 kings until the year 1253, when it was destroyed by an invasion of the Mongol Empire. The capital city was at Dali. In 1274 the Province of Yunnan was created, and the region has since been incorporated within China.

== Yuan dynasty ==
The Mongols established regular and tight administrative control over Yunnan. In 1253 Möngke of the Mongol Empire dispatched the prince Kublai (the eventual founder of the Yuan dynasty) to take Yunnan. The Mongols swept away numerous native kingdoms, including the Dali Kingdom. Later Yunnan became one of the ten provinces set up by Kublai. Kublai Khan appointed Turkmen Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar governor in Yunnan in 1273. Before that, the area had been ruled by a local king and a Mongol prince under the Great Khan. The Yuan provincial authorities conferred various titles on many native chieftains, who were obliged to pay taxes. When the Mongols were expelled from China proper in 1368, Yunnan was thrown into chaos and anarchy for a number of years. The Ming dynasty defeated the last of the Yuan loyalists in 1381.

== Ming dynasty ==
The newly proclaimed Ming dynasty did not send armies into Yunnan until 1381. The central government allowed the general Mu Ying, foster son of dynastic founder Zhu Yuanzhang, to set up a hereditary feudatory system in the province. Throughout the Ming, the Mu family developed tremendous influence in Yunnan.

From the end of the 15th century, the Toungoo Dynasty in Myanmar began encroaching on Yunnan. In the 16th century Chen Yongbin, the governor of Yunnan, held back a Myanmar invasion. After the war, he built eight passes along the border in Tengyue subprefecture to mark the demarcation between the two countries.

== Qing dynasty ==
After the fall of the Ming in northern China, Yunnan became the last Southern Ming regime headed by Zhu Youlang. Supported by rebel loyalists, he persisted in resistance against the Qing conquest even after the Qing capture of Kunming in 1659. Zhu and his men then fled into Myanmar to seek refuge in Ava, but were treated as prisoners. Zhu&#x27;s armed followers savaged Upper Myanmar in an attempt to rescue him. General Wu Sangui, then still loyal to the Qing, invaded Myanmar in 1662 with a sizable army, and demanded Zhu&#x27;s surrender. Although he hesitated, King Pye finally decided to hand Zhu over to avoid hostility. Wu Sangui later turned against the Manchus but died in 1678. Yunnan finally fell to the Qing army in 1681.

== Pingnan Sultanate ==
Waves of conflict between the Muslim Hui people in Yunnan and the Qing government escalated into an all out rebellion in 1856. The rebels in western Yunnan under the leadership of Du Wenxiu became the major military and political center of opposition to the Qing government. They turned their fury on the local mandarins and ended up challenging the central government in Beijing. The rebellion successfully captured the city of Dali, which became the base for the rebels&#x27; operations, and they declared themselves a separate political entity from China. The rebels identified their nation as Pingnan Guo () and Du Wenxiu was styled Qa´id Jami al-Muslimin (&#x27;Leader of the Community of Muslims&#x27;), but is usually referred to in foreign sources as Sultan, and ruled 1856 – 26 December 1872. The sultanate reached the high-water mark of their power and glory in 1860.

The Sultanate&#x27;s power declined after 1868. The Chinese Imperial Government had succeeded in reinvigorating itself. By 1871, it was directing a campaign for the annihilation of the obdurate Hui Muslims of Yunnan. Though largely forgotten, the bloody rebellion caused the deaths of up to a million people in Yunnan. Many adherents to the Yunnanese Muslim cause were persecuted by the imperial Manchus. Wholesale massacres of Yunnanese Muslims followed.

For a period of perhaps ten to fifteen years following the collapse of the Panthay Rebellion, the province&#x27;s Hui minority was widely discriminated against by the victorious Qing, especially in the western frontier districts contiguous with Burma. During these years the refugee Hui settled across the frontier within Burma gradually established themselves in their traditional callings – as merchants, caravaneers, miners, restaurateurs and (for those who chose or were forced to live beyond the law) as smugglers and mercenaries and became known in Burma as the Panthay.

== Republican China ==

Following the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Yunnan came under the control of local warlords, who had more than the usual degree of autonomy due to Yunnan&#x27;s remoteness. They financed their regime through opium harvesting and traffic.

In Second Sino-Japanese War, Yunnan served as, among other things, a home base for the Flying Tigers and a refuge for people, especially university faculty and students, from the east. These had originally retreated to Changsha, but as the Japanese forces were gaining more territory they eventually bombed Changsha in February 1938. The 800 staff faculty and students who were left had to flee and made the 1,000-mile journey to Kunming. It was here that the National Southwest Associated University (commonly known as Lianda) was established. In these extraordinary wartime circumstances for eight years, staff, professors and students had to survive and operate in makeshift quarters that were subject to sporadic bombing campaigns by Japan. There were dire shortages of food, equipment, books, clothing and other essential needs, but they did manage to conduct the running of a modern university. Over those eight years of war (1937–1945), Lianda became famous nationwide for having and producing many, if not most, of China&#x27;s most prominent academics, scholars, scientists and intellectuals. Both of China&#x27;s only Nobel laureates in physics studied at Lianda.

== People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
The establishment of the PRC brought gradual but definite consolidation to China&#x27;s southwestern borders, solidifying what were previously murky claims to various regions.

For example, Colonial French and English had been active at sites in neighbouring northern Laos, Vietnam and Burma, and even inside of modern Yunnan at sites like Tengchong and Gejiu. In fact, between 1904 and 1909 the French had built the long Sino-Vietnamese Railway which ran from Hanoi to Kunming via Hekou, with an offshoot to Gejiu. The English tried to match the French effort with the Yunnan–Burma Railway, but failed to complete it prior to the outbreak of war, with the project ultimately abandoned.

The PRC also saw a bitter Sino-Vietnamese War fought along Yunnan&#x27;s south eastern border, which was properly demarcated only on 23 February 2009, with renewed agreements taking effect as late as 14 July 2010.

In the southern region of Xishuangbanna, little or no Han dominance was felt as late as the end of the 19th century. This is illustrated by Otto E. Ehlers&#x27; (1855–1895) account of his walk from Rangoon to Jinghong, recording upon his arrival that the annual Chinese tribute mission from northerly Simao was in town and, whilst they were happy to allow him to stay on the south of the Mekong river, he was not to be lent assistance in crossing over. He had no trouble crossing with the aid of a local, regardless.

<doc id="962381" wikidata="Q3805008" url="?curid=962381" title="Paddle tennis">
<text>Paddle tennis (sometimes branded as POP Tennis since 2015) is a racket sport adapted from tennis and played for over a century. Compared to tennis, the court is smaller, has no doubles lanes, and the net is lower. Paddle tennis is played with a solid perforated paddle, as opposed to a strung racquet, and a lower pressure tennis ball.

The same court is used for both singles and doubles, with doubles being the dominant and more popular form of play. The smaller court size adds a strong emphasis and advantage to net play and allows for a fast and reaction-based game.

== History ==
During year 1898, paddle tennis was invented by Episcopal minister Frank Peter Beal in Albion, Michigan. Afterwards, the sport spread in lower Manhattan where Beal wanted to create recreational activities for neighborhood children. In 1915, Beal got the Manhattan parks and recreation department to lay courts in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. The first tournament was held in 1922, and the United States Paddle Tennis Association (USPTA) was formed the following year. (The United States Paddle Tennis Association is not to be confused with the United States Professional Tennis Association founded in 1970.) By 1941, paddle tennis was being played in almost 500 American cities.

Although Frank Peer Beal is known as the game&#x27;s inventor, Murray Geller, a player in the 1940s and 1950s, was instrumental in creating the modern game. Elected chairman of the USPTA rules committee, he wanted to make a game that was more appealing to adults, and instituted features including an enlarged court and an underhanded serve.

Scott Freedman won the World&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Singles Paddle Tennis Championships 19 times, the World Men&#x27;s Doubles Championships 16 times, and the World Mixed Doubles 14 times. He wrote a book titled &quot;Paddle Tennis and Tennis: Anyone Can Play&quot;.

In 2015 and 2016, the USPTA tried to rebrand the sport as &quot;POP Tennis&quot;, began producing logo-branded gear, and changed its name to the International POP Tennis Association (IPTA). The name was chosen in reference to the &quot;pop&quot; sound made when the paddle hits the ball.

== Rules ==

Paddle tennis courts are constructed of the same materials as tennis courts, or can also be placed on hard beach sand. The court measures 50 feet (15.2 4m) baseline-to-baseline and 20 feet (6.09 m) across, with the service line 3 feet (0.91 m) in from the baseline. This creates a service box of 10 × 22 feet (3.04 × 6.70 m). The net is placed at a height of 31 inches (0.78 m). On the west coast, a restraint line is drawn 12 feet (3.66 m) back parallel to the net. The back two on either side of the court are made of a special type of layered glass, that allows for rebounds to take place. 

During play, all players must keep both feet behind the restraint line until after the player receiving the serve has struck the ball. 

All paddle rules are similar to tennis. Paddle tennis second serves also have to be bounced at least once in the other opponents side.

== Summary ==
* Players: Four, played in a doubles format.
* Serves: Serves must be underhand. A second serve is allowed only in the event of a net ball that lands in bounds, as in tennis.
* Score: Scoring method is the same as in tennis. Matches are best of five sets.
* Ball: Tennis ball with reduced pressure.
* Paddle: Solid with no strings. May be perforated.
* Court: There are two styles of courts. East and West coast styles.
* Walls: Walls or fences play the same role as in tennis, once the ball comes in contact with either the point is over.

== Similar sports ==

Padel is a similar sport typically played in doubles on an enclosed court about half the size of a tennis court. It is popular in Spain and Hispanic America.

Pickleball is a similar sport invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington. It is played on a similar court and with a similar paddle but uses a plastic wiffle ball.

Platform tennis is a similar sport invented in 1928 in Scarsdale, New York by James Cogswell and Fessenden Blanchard. The primary difference from paddle tennis is that the platform tennis court is 6 feet shorter, fenced by taut chicken wire off which the ball can be played. Platform tennis uses a solid sponge rubber ball and overhead serving is permitted. Platform tennis is popular in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S., since the raised court (the platform) can be heated for winter play.

<doc id="962384" wikidata="Q751917" url="?curid=962384" title="Midsomer Murders">
<text>Midsomer Murders is a British crime drama mystery television series, adapted by Anthony Horowitz and Douglas Watkinson from the novels in the &quot;Chief Inspector Barnaby&quot; book series created by Caroline Graham. It has been broadcast on the ITV network since its premiere on 23 March 1997. The series focuses on various murder cases that take place within small country villages across the fictional English county of Midsomer, and the efforts of the senior police detective and his partner within the fictional Midsomer Constabulary to solve the crime by determining who the culprit is and the motive for their actions. It differs from other detective dramas in featuring a mixture of lighthearted whimsy and dark humour, as well as a notable soundtrack with a title theme that includes a theremin.

The programme has featured two lead stars: from its premiere in 1997, John Nettles as Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Tom Barnaby, until his retirement from the drama in February 2011; then Neil Dudgeon as DCI John Barnaby, Tom&#x27;s younger cousin, since March 2011. Both main stars have featured a list of supporting actors who worked alongside them, including Jane Wymark, Barry Jackson, Daniel Casey, John Hopkins, Jason Hughes, and Gwilym Lee, with Nick Hendrix as the current co-star working with Dudgeon. &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; remains a popular feature in British television schedules and has been broadcast internationally in over 200 countries and territories.

==Summary==
&quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; is a detective drama set in modern-day England. The stories revolve around the efforts of Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, and later his successor, cousin John Barnaby, to solve numerous murders that take place in the picturesque but deadly villages of the fictional county of Midsomer. The Barnabys have worked with several different sergeants throughout the run of the show: Detective Sergeant (DS) Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey), DS Dan Scott (John Hopkins), DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes), DS Charlie Nelson (Gwilym Lee) and DS Jamie Winter (Nick Hendrix).

==Production==
Filming of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; began in the autumn of 1996, and the first episode, &quot;The Killings at Badger&#x27;s Drift&quot;, was broadcast in the United Kingdom on 23 March 1997. This inaugural episode was the highest-rated single drama programme of 1997, watched by 13.5 million viewers. Throughout its run, the feature-length drama has attracted many well-known accomplished actors from the stage and screen in guest-starring roles.

Anthony Horowitz and the original producers, Betty Willingale and Brian True-May, created the series. Horowitz adapted the majority of the early episodes from the original works by Caroline Graham. Current writers include Helen Jenkins, Jeff Povey, Nicholas Hicks-Beach, Julia Gilbert and Maria Ward.

Initially John Nettles acted in the role of Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby. Nettles&#x27; character retired at the end of 2010, after the 13th series of eight episodes; his last episode was &quot;Fit for Murder&quot;. Neil Dudgeon replaced him in the 14th series, playing Tom Barnaby&#x27;s cousin, DCI John Barnaby, who was seen in a series 13 episode, &quot;The Sword of Guillaume&quot;. Dudgeon made his first appearance in &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; in the series 4 episode &quot;Garden of Death&quot;, in which he played the role of a tongue-in-cheek gardener, Daniel Bolt, rather interested in sex.

Series 20 began in the UK on ITV on 10 March 2019, with episode 1, &quot;The Ghosts of Causton Abbey&quot;. In the US, the entire six-episode series was immediately released on the streaming services Acorn TV and BritBox, and became available on Netflix after the UK broadcast schedule had finished. The show was removed from Netflix in October 2019; only the first 19 series had been shown on the service. Series 20 onward have never been shown on Netflix in US or Canada. As of January, 2021, series 1–20 can be seen in the US on IMDb TV and Tubi TV.

The show&#x27;s official social media confirmed that production of series 21 began in March 2019. As with series 20, series 21 was initially released in the USA. It premiered on Acorn TV and BritBox on 1 December 2019, before airing in the UK in January 2020.

Published in &quot;The Cinemaholic&quot; in Aug 2024, they have &quot;learned that the network has joined Acorn TV to renew &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; for its twenty-fifth season. The instalment’s filming began in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2024.&quot;

===Setting===
Midsomer is a fictional English county. The county town is Causton, a medium-sized town where Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby lives with his wife and where the Criminal Investigation Department is located. Much of the popularity of the series arises from the incongruity of sudden violence in a picturesque and peaceful rural setting. Various clues in several episodes hint that Midsomer might actually cover the areas of Berkshire and part of northern Hampshire. This may be supported by the episode &quot;Dead in the Water&quot; where a body is found in the River Thames.

Many of the villages and small towns of the county have the word &quot;Midsomer&quot; in their name; this is inspired in part by the real county of Somerset, and specifically, its actual town of Midsomer Norton, and became a naming convention within the show. Midsomer Wellow and Causton are derived from the names of real Somerset villages Wellow and Corston.

Each episode usually contains several murders, the high body count being a well-known feature of the show. Despite this, the culprit is almost never a serial killer—very frequently the murderer is driven by circumstance to compound his or her crimes, and keeps killing to cover up the original murder.

Humour is a main feature of the series. There is often dark comedy, such as a woman being murdered with a wheel of cheese, and many scenes are examples of &quot;dramedy&quot; (comic drama or dramatic comedy). According to &quot;Radio Times&quot; when describing the episode &quot;Death and the Divas&quot; (series 15, episode 4): &quot;&quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; never takes itself too seriously but here it&#x27;s got its tongue so far into its cheek, it hurts.&quot;

Nostalgia has also been a feature of the show, especially in its Nettles era. Most episodes have been set in rural villages of a kind that were already changing rapidly by the time the series began, Nettles opined in a 2003 interview. The old-fashioned settings are true to the Graham novels: &quot;Although the books are set in the present&quot;, wrote one reviewer, Graham&#x27;s country villages &quot;seem to come from another time&quot;. &quot;The spirit is obviously of the &#x27;50s&quot;, Nettles remarked, and the less crowded, less complicated village/world was clearly part of the books&#x27; appeal.

===Filming locations===
Causton is represented by a number of towns including Thame and Wallingford, in Oxfordshire.

The Six Bells, a pub in Warborough, Oxfordshire, repeatedly features as the Black Swan in the Midsomer village of Badger&#x27;s Drift. The Bull &amp; Butcher, the village pub in Turville, Buckinghamshire, featured in both &quot;Murder on St. Malley&#x27;s Day&quot; (renamed as The Chalk and Gown) and in &quot;Schooled in Murder&quot; (renamed as The Spotted Cow).

Filming took place on Sunday 11 August 2013 at White Waltham Airfield, southwest of Maidenhead, for episode 4 of Series 16, &quot;The Flying Club&quot;.

The Buckinghamshire tourism authority announced in 2021 the launching of three themed tours of locations in the county that have been used to film the series.

In &quot;The Killings of Copenhagen&quot; - number five in the sixteenth series and the 100th episode overall—several scenes are filmed on location in central Copenhagen, like Rådhuspladsen (&quot;the City Hall Square&quot;), Nyhavn (&quot;New Port&quot;) with its canal and old colourful houses, a Danish countryside church, and at the circular courtyard inside the Copenhagen Police Headquarters building. The murder in Copenhagen is one of three within the entire series (until episode 114, at least) that take place outside the fictional county of Midsomer, the others being in Wales where DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) travel in &quot;Death and Dust&quot; and Brighton where Inspector John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) is introduced.

==Characters==

==Episodes==

The pilot episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; was shown on 23 March 1997. 140 episodes have been produced across 24 series. As of 10 November 2024, 136 episodes have been broadcast in the UK, comprising 23 series. New series may air in different territories before the UK. Air dates may vary by region.
=== 20th anniversary special ===
In June 2019, British-American streaming service Acorn TV began streaming a 20th Anniversary Special presented by John Nettles. The one-hour documentary brings together former and current actors on the show as well as producers and others working behind the scene to discuss memorable moments from the past 20 series and the peculiar quirks that have made the show a success.

=== 25th anniversary documentary===
In May 2022, ITV announced that there would be a documentary celebrating the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

Entitled &quot;Midsomer Murders – 25 Years of Mayhem&quot; it featured contributions from cast members including John Nettles, Neil Dudgeon, Jane Wymark, Fiona Dolman, Daniel Casey, Jason Hughes and Annette Badland, as well as writer Jeff Povey and producer Ian Strachan. It also delved behind the scenes of filming series 23 and highlighted pre-fame appearances by actors such as Orlando Bloom and Henry Cavill.

ITV subsequently announced that the one-hour documentary would air on the channel on Sunday 29 May 2022 at 7pm.

==Controversy==
In March 2011, the series&#x27; producer, Brian True-May, was suspended by All3Media after telling the TV listings magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot; that the programme did not have any non-white characters because the series was &quot;the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way&quot;. When challenged about the term &quot;Englishness&quot; and whether that would exclude ethnic minorities, True-May responded: &quot;Well, it should do, and maybe I&#x27;m not politically correct.&quot; He later went on to say that he wanted to make a programme &quot;that appeals to a certain audience, which seems to succeed.&quot; True-May&#x27;s comments were investigated by the production company. He was reinstated, having apologised &quot;if his remarks gave unintended offence to any viewers&quot;, but subsequently stepped down as producer. ITV said it was &quot;shocked and appalled&quot; at True-May&#x27;s comments, which were &quot;absolutely not shared by anyone at ITV&quot;.

True-May&#x27;s replacement, Jo Wright, confirmed that she was committed to on-screen diversity when she took over the helm of the show, saying: &quot;I feel strongly that a range of ethnic groups should be represented on screen. And that will be reflected in some of the episodes in the new series with key guest casting. I will cast the series in the same way as I always do, by starting with the best script. And a good script will include a variety of different characters.&quot; In series 15, Asian actors played central characters in the show for the first time, in the episode &quot;Written in the Stars&quot;. Black characters also began to appear starting in that series. Beginning with series 18, the show gained an Asian member for its main cast: pathologist Kam Karimore, played by Manjinder Virk. However, she left the show at the end of series 19.

==Broadcast==
In 2004, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; was among the three most-sold British TV shows worldwide, whether as TV programming or DVD. , &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; had been sold to more than 200 countries around the world.

In Australia, first-run episodes and repeats are screened on the national free-to-air network ABC with repeats also shown on the Nine Network channel, 9Gem. The series was originally only aired on the Nine Network. Repeat screenings are also aired on the subscription channels UKTV and 13th Street. A measure of the success of the series in Australia is that repeats of the series still rate highly and often feature in the nation&#x27;s top twenty shows in national surveys.

In Canada, the series is broadcast on TVOntario and Book Television in Ontario, on Knowledge in British Columbia, and via American PBS channels available throughout southern parts of Canada. , the first thirteen series are currently available in Canada on Amazon Prime Video, while only series 21 is available on Britbox. The first nineteen series are also available on streaming service/app Tubi and Acorn.

In Ireland, the series is aired on Virgin Media Three every Monday night at 8 pm. It is one of the channel&#x27;s highest-rated shows.

In New Zealand, the series was broadcast on TVNZ 1 and it was broadcast for a number of years on the free-to-air channel Prime.

In the United States, the series was first aired by A&amp;E, which broadcast &quot;The Killings at Badger&#x27;s Drift&quot; on 28 June 1998 and followed with the next four episodes over the 1998–99 series. The show remained on A&amp;E for many years until it was syndicated by American Public Television for broadcast on public television stations. All 24 series are currently available on the streaming service Acorn TV, which also offers the programme in Canada. The show is also broadcast in the USA on the Ion Mystery Network, and it has a dedicated channel on the streaming service Pluto TV.

The Paramount Channel broadcasts episode reruns daily.

==Soundtracks==
Composed by Jim Parker, the main theme is a moderate-tempo waltz, performed (primarily though not exclusively) on an unusual electronic musical instrument, the theremin, which has a sound not unlike a low whistle or a human voice. The theremin part was played by Celia Sheen (1940–2011). From the 14th series onwards the soundtrack was altered so that during the closing titles a standardised version of the theme is played on a solo violin in place of the theremin. Occasionally a version with a longer introduction opens the show, using a flute rather than a theremin as the lead instrument.

The closing theme for &quot;The Scarecrow Murders&quot;, shown on 29 May 2022 to celebrate 25 years, was a more jovial clarinet version.

Multiple soundtrack CDs have been released so far, containing versions of the theme and musical cues from various series.

==Home media==
All 140 episodes have been released in the US (Region 1) and in the UK (Region 2) including three Christmas specials, by Acorn Media. The first 18 series and &quot;Part 1&quot; of series 19 of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; have been released in Australia and New Zealand (Region 4).

Note that episodes 1 to 100 were originally released as 25 DVD &quot;sets&quot;, which were not in chronological order and are now discontinued. They have been re-released in 2015 as chronological &quot;series&quot; 1 to 16 in redesigned packages. To confuse fans further, Costco Warehouses sold 5 abbreviated (region 1) sets with one less disc, but used the same &quot;set&quot; numberings even though they did not match the retail &quot;sets&quot;.

Blue-ray discs were released for &quot;Sets&quot; 17 through 25 and &quot;Series&quot; 16 through 24, picking up where the &quot;sets&quot; left off but not re-issuing the &quot;sets&quot; in resigned packages like the DVDs did.

In January 2006, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; started a DVD and Magazine Collection, available at newsagents in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK.

Acorn Media had released DVD chronological order collections of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; in North America which are:
* &quot;The Early Cases&quot; 10 disc collection of 18 episodes includes the pilot episode and those of series one, two, three, and four (except the last episode), as well as a bonus disc featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary.
* Acorn&#x27;s &quot;Barnaby&#x27;s Casebook&quot; 10 disc collection has 17 episodes, including the last episode of series four, followed by those of series five, six, and seven.
* Acorn&#x27;s &quot;Village Case Files&quot; 8 disc collection includes the 16 episodes of series eight, and nine; and a 4-minute bonus clip from series one.
* Acorn&#x27;s &quot;Mayhem &amp; Mystery&quot; 15 disc collection includes the 17 episodes of series ten and eleven.
* Acorn&#x27;s &quot;Tom Barnaby&#x27;s Last Cases&quot; 15 disc collection includes the 17 episodes of series twelve and thirteen.

Below table are the release dates for complete series sets in both Australia Region 4 and United Kingdom Region 2.

<text>Bulk mail broadly refers to mail that is mailed and processed in bulk at reduced rates. The term is sometimes used as a synonym for advertising mail.

The United States Postal Service (USPS) defines bulk mail broadly as &quot;quantities of mail prepared for mailing at reduced postage rates.&quot; The preparation includes presorting and placing into containers by ZIP code. The containers, along with a manifest, are taken to an area in a post office called a bulk-mail-entry unit. The presorting and the use of containers allow highly automated mail processing, both in bulk and piecewise, in processing facilities called bulk mail centers (BMCs).

In 2009, the USPS announced plans to streamline sorting and delivery. BMCs were renamed Network Distribution Centers.

==Junk mail==

Although bulk mail, junk mail, and admail are, strictly speaking, not synonymous, the terms are used in common parlance to refer to unsolicited invitations delivered by mail (typically, but not invariably, at bulk rates) to homes and businesses.

<text>Michael J. Cullen (1884–1936) was an American entrepreneur and salesman known as the founder of the King Kullen grocery store chain, widely considered to be the first supermarket founded in America. He is recognized by the Smithsonian Institution as the inventor of the modern supermarket.

==History==
Cullen was born in 1884 as the child of Irish immigrants. His surname derives from the Irish name O&#x27; Cuileannain or Ó Cuilinn. He joined The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company in 1902 at the age of 18 and worked for the firm for 17 years. In 1919, Cullen joined Kroger Stores and worked for the company until 1930. While working as a Kroger regional manager in southern Illinois, he developed the idea of a supermarket. In 1930, at age 46, he wrote a letter to the president of Kroger, proposing a new type of food store with a focus on low prices, larger square footage, cash sales, no delivery service, and low-rent locations with plenty of parking. Cullen dramatically proclaimed: &quot;I would lead the public out of the high-priced houses of bondage into the low prices of the house of the promised land.&quot; 

Cullen&#x27;s letter went unanswered. Undaunted, and confident in his ability to see his idea become a reality, he quit his job and moved his family to Long Island to launch his own store. Cullen leased a vacant garage at the corner of 171st Street and Jamaica Avenue in Queens, just a few blocks from a busy shopping district. On August 4, 1930, King Kullen Grocery Company opened the doors to the world&#x27;s first supermarket. The store carried a range of approximately 1,000 items, including automotive accessories and hardware, as well as groceries. Success was rapid. People came from miles around. To many of his customers, Cullen offered convenient and affordable food. Bold newspaper ads described the store as the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Price Wrecker.&quot; 

The chain expanded rapidly in the price-conscious environment of the Great Depression. King Kullen stores reused large older buildings, including abandoned factories and warehouses, in low-rent locations on the borders of populated areas. Facilities were simple. Service was minimal. Shopping carts were used and national brands were emphasized. The stores&#x27; no-frills bargain environment resonated with Depression-era customers. Ample, free parking was available in order to appeal to customers with automobiles and encourage them to purchase large quantities. By 1936 there were 17 King Kullen supermarkets with annual revenue of approximately $6,000,000. At the time, Cullen had plans for faster national expansion and franchising. However, in 1936, at age 52, Cullen died suddenly following an appendix operation. Following his death, the rate of growth of the firm slowed.

==Legacy==

Although Cullen did not live long enough to see himself vindicated by history, he correctly foresaw that the supermarket would literally become the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Price Wrecker&quot;. One sign of the supermarket&#x27;s success in slashing labor costs, overhead, and food prices was that the percentage of disposable income spent by American consumers on food plunged &quot;from 21 percent in 1930 to 16 percent in 1940&quot;. 

Existing grocery store retailers, including leading chains Safeway, Kroger and The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, found the supermarket concept easy to imitate. The number of supermarkets in the United States exploded from 94 in 1934 to 1,200 in 1936 to over 15,000 by 1950. 

Meanwhile, King Kullen continued to grow and expand through the leadership of Cullen&#x27;s wife and the support of family members. However, relative to competitors, its rate of growth has been slow. From 17 stores in 1936, the firm grew to 52 stores in 2009 (effectively 35 stores in 73 years). As of 2010, King Kullen was the 72nd largest supermarket chain in the United States, with 52 stores and US$940m in sales in 2009. It is currently owned and operated by the third generation of Cullen&#x27;s descendants.

As of October 2016, the chain has 34 King Kullen locations, and also operates five &quot;Wild by Nature&quot; natural and organic markets.

<text>Bytča () is a town in northwestern Slovakia. It is located on the Váh River near the cities of Žilina and Považská Bystrica. It belongs to Upper Váh region of tourism.

==Etymology==
The name comes from a Slavic personal name &quot;Bytek&quot;, &quot;Bytko&quot; → &quot;Bytča&quot;.

==History==
The town arose in 1946 by a merger of the settlements Malá Bytča (including Beňov and Mikšová), Veľká Bytča and Hliník nad Váhom. The first written reference to the town&#x27;s main part Veľká Bytča dates from 1234 as &quot;terra Bycha&quot;. The settlement got its town charter in 1378. It was the seat of a feudal dominion and later a town with many craftsmen. In Hungarian, it was known as Biccse.

==Landmarks==
The town features a famous castle the Thurzó Castle built as a water castle by Pongrác Szentmiklósi in the 13th century and rebuilt in the 16th century in Renaissance style by Ferenc Thurzó.

<text>The Australasian gannet (Morus serrator), also known as the Australian gannet or tākapu, is a large seabird of the booby and gannet family, Sulidae. Adults are mostly white, with black flight feathers at the wingtips and lining the trailing edge of the wing. The central tail feathers are also black. The head is tinged buff-yellow, with a pearly grey bill edged in dark grey or black, and blue-rimmed eyes. Young birds have mottled plumage in their first year, dark above and light below. The head is an intermediate mottled grey, with a dark bill. The birds gradually acquire more white in subsequent seasons until they reach maturity after five years.

The species range over water above the continental shelf along the southern and eastern Australian coastline, from Steep Point in Western Australia to Rockhampton, Queensland, as well as the North and South Islands of New Zealand, Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. Nesting takes place in colonies along the coastlines of New Zealand, Victoria and Tasmania—mostly on offshore islands, although there are several mainland colonies in both countries. Highly territorial when breeding, the Australasian gannet performs agonistic displays to defend its nest. Potential and mated pairs engage in courtship and greeting displays. The nest is a cup-shaped mound composed of seaweed, earth, and other debris, built by the female from material mainly gathered by the male. A single pale blue egg is laid yearly, though lost eggs may be replaced. The chick is born featherless but is soon covered in white down. Fed regurgitated fish by its parents, it grows rapidly and outweighs the average adult when it fledges.

These birds are plunge divers and spectacular fishers, plunging into the ocean at high speed. They eat mainly squid and forage fish that school near the surface. The species faces few natural or man-made threats, and since its population is growing it is considered to be a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy==
Sir Joseph Banks shot three Australasian gannets in New Zealand waters on 24 December 1769 off Three Kings Islands. The birds were cooked in a goose pie, which was enjoyed by the sailors, for Christmas the next day. Daniel Solander wrote a formal description, noting its differences from the familiar northern gannet, initially giving it the name &quot;Pelecanus chrysocephalus&quot; before crossing it out and changing it to &quot;Pelecanus sectator&quot;. Sydney Parkinson illustrated the bird as &quot;P. sectator&quot;, which was misread as &quot;P. serrator&quot; by later authorities. The species name has been translated as &quot;sawyer&quot;, from &quot;serra&quot; &quot;saw&quot;, and linked to the serrated bill.

John Gould described specimens from the Derwent River and Actaeon Island in Tasmania as &quot;Sula australis&quot; in 1841. The binomial name &quot;Sula australis&quot; had already been used by J. F. Stephens for the red-footed booby. English zoologist George Robert Gray wrote of the species in 1843, initially using Gould&#x27;s name but soon switching to &quot;Sula serrator&quot;, based on Parkinson&#x27;s drawing. Although Gould stuck with &quot;S. australis&quot;, &quot;S. serrator&quot; became the preferred term over time.

&quot;Australasian gannet&quot; has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). It is also known as Pacific gannet and, in Australia, as Australian gannet, diver (from its plunge-diving), booby, or solan goose. In New Zealand it is also known by the Māori name &quot;tākapu&quot; or &quot;tākupu&quot;, a word of wider Polynesian origin for a gannet or booby.

The Sulidae, the gannets and boobies, appeared about 30 million years ago. Early Sulidae fossils most resembled the boobies, although they were more aquatic, the gannets splitting off later, about 16 million years ago. The gannets evolved in the northern hemisphere, later colonising the southern oceans. The most ancient extant species may be the Abbott&#x27;s booby, possibly the sole survivor of an otherwise extinct separate lineage. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA suggests that the ancestor of the gannets arose around 2.5 million years ago before splitting into northern and southern lineages. The latter then split into the Cape and Australasian gannets around 0.5 million years ago. The three gannets are generally considered to be separate species forming a superspecies, though they have also formerly been classified as subspecies of the northern gannet (&quot;Sula bassanus&quot;).

== Description ==

An adult Australasian gannet is long, weighs , and has a wingspan. The two sexes are generally of a similar size and appearance, though a 2015 field study at Pope&#x27;s Eye and Point Danger colonies found females to be 3.1% and 7.3% heavier respectively. Females also had a slightly larger ulna and smaller bill. The plumage is white with black flight feathers on the wings, and central rectrices of the tail. Some individuals have more extensive black plumage of their tail feathers. There is a sharp demarcation between light and dark plumage. Black primary feathers are more resilient to wear, which may explain the dark plumage of the wings. The head and hindneck are tinged buff-yellow. The colour is more pronounced on the head and during breeding season. The eyes have a light grey iris surrounded by a pale blue eye ring, and bare black skin on the face which merges into the bill. In adults, the bill is pearly grey with dark grey or black edges, and a black groove running down the length of the upper mandible. The four-toed feet are dark grey and joined by a membrane of similar colour. There are light green lines running along the ridges of the toes that continue along up the front of the legs.

Fledglings are brownish-grey speckled with white overall. They have dark brown bills, bare facial skin and eyes, and dark grey legs and feet. Australasian gannets take 2–5 years to gain adult plumage. Over this period, the upperparts and underparts gradually whiten and the crown and nape become buff-coloured, but there is great variation in the age that mature plumage is seen.

This species is distinctive and only likely to be confused with species that do not generally share its range. The Cape gannet is a rare vagrant to Australasian waters and has an all-black tail, while the masked and red-footed boobies are generally restricted to tropical waters. Although both have mostly white plumage, they lack the buff colouring of the head and have white tails. The masked booby has a blue-black face and less black on the wing, while the red-footed booby has red feet.

=== Call ===
The Australasian gannet is generally silent at sea and loud and vocal at the colony in the day and at times overnight during the breeding season. Its typical call is a harsh &quot;arrah-arrah&quot; or &quot;urrah-urrah&quot;, which is emitted upon approaching or arriving at the colony or as a threat. The calls can vary between individuals, and the female&#x27;s call is lower pitched than the male&#x27;s.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australasian gannet is found from Steep Point in Western Australia, along the southern and eastern Australian coastline to the vicinity of Rockhampton in Queensland, as well as the North and South Islands of New Zealand, Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. At sea, it is generally restricted to waters over the continental shelf, and may enter harbours, bays and estuaries, particularly in stormy weather. Over May and June, young gannets from New Zealand colonies disperse to the north and west, mainly flying north around the North Island and (to a lesser extent) via the Cook Strait. They generally reach as far as southeastern Queensland and Rottnest Island in Western Australia. Far-wandering gannets are occasional visitors to Marion Island and the Crozet Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, and have even reached South Africa where they have interbred with Cape gannets. Some immature gannets spend 3 to 4 years in Australian waters before returning to New Zealand, while others remain in New Zealand waters. 

===Breeding colonies===

Breeding colonies are mostly on offshore islands, though several mainland colonies exist in Australia and New Zealand. Numbers of Australasian gannet have been increasing since 1950, although some colonies have disappeared and others have decreased in size. Between 1980 and 2000, the population in Australian waters increased from approximately 6,600 to 20,000 breeding pairs. The most recent comprehensive New Zealand census was in 1981, yielding an estimate of 46,600 pairs, estimated to have increased to around 55,000 pairs in 2006. Colony location is related to sea temperature, which in turn dictates the presence of fish. Many colonies have limited space and birds seek new locations once the nest sites in a colony are full, at this point often spilling over onto the mainland.

In Victoria, there are colonies at Lawrence Rocks near Portland, and Pope&#x27;s Eye and Wedge Light in Port Phillip near Melbourne. The colony on Lawrence Rocks increased from 200 pairs in 1873 to around 3,100 pairs in 1996–97, by which time all available space on the island had been filled. Gannets began roosting at Point Danger—the closest point on the mainland itself—in 1995, and began nesting the following year after a fox-proof fence was erected around the site. The only nesting locale on mainland Australia itself, the Point Danger colony, has increased steadily, reaching 660 pairs in 1999–2000. Located northeast of Portsea, Pope&#x27;s Eye is a low artificial semicircular stone breakwater. Gannets began breeding on manmade structures in Port Phillip in 1966, with three pairs at Wedge Light. By the 1999–2000 season, there were 507 pairs there, and on seven other artificial structures around the bay.

In Tasmania, there are colonies at Eddystone Rock and Pedra Branca off the south coast, and in Bass Strait at Cat Island off Flinders Island, and Black Pyramid Rock off the northwest coast. The colony on Black Pyramid grew from 500 pairs in 1961 to 12,300 pairs in 1998. Eddystone Rock increased from 20 pairs in 1947 to 189 pairs in 1998, and Pedra Branca grew from 1000 pairs in 1939 to 3,300 pairs by 1995, but both these sites have little or no room for expansion. Conversely, the colony at Cat Island fell from an estimated 5–10,000 pairs in 1908 to negligible numbers by the turn of the millennium due to predation.

In New Zealand, almost all breeding colonies are on or around the North Island. Kārewa / Gannet Island, offshore from Kawhia, was named as &#x27;Gannet Island&#x27; by Captain James Cook in January 1770 for the gannets seen there and 8,003 pairs were counted in a 1981 census. Manawatāwhi / Three Kings Islands, north-west of Cape Reinga, contained New Zealand&#x27;s largest offshore gannet colonies, with 9,855 pairs across five smaller colonies in 1981; an aerial survey in 2014–15 found that it had shrunk to 6,402 pairs. Whakaari / White Island, offshore in the Bay of Plenty and comprising five smaller colonies, also saw a reduction in numbers, from 6,662 pairs in 1980–81 to 5,306 pairs in 2014–15. The colony at Cape Kidnappers in Hawke&#x27;s Bay is thought to have been settled around 1850, with 100 pairs reported in 1885. It had 5,186 pairs counted in a 1981 census, and has steadily grown to over 6500 pairs, making it the largest and most accessible mainland colony in the world. Muriwai, near Auckland, comprises a mainland colony on Okatamiro Point, estimated at 1,385 pairs in 2016, while nearby Motutara (Pillar Rock) had 187 pairs. Gannets established a colony on Tikitiki Rock (Nine Pin Rock) in the outer Bay of Islands in 2007, which had around 70 pairs by 2017. A small colony was established at Young Nick&#x27;s Head in 2008.

On the South Island, gannets began breeding at the end of Farewell Spit in 1983, in an area known as Shellbanks—a 2 m (7 ft) high area of shells and driftwood interspersed with low vegetation: marram (&quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot;), sea rocket (&quot;Cakile edentula&quot;), velvety nightshade (&quot;Solanum chenopodioides&quot;) and sowthistle (&quot;Sonchus oleraceus&quot;). Strong winds allow gannets to take off vertically most of the time, and the decline in commercial fishing in nearby Golden Bay and Tasman Bay is thought to have increased food supply. The breeding area is cut off from the mainland by high tides, but can be badly impacted by storms. It grew by around 11% per year, reaching an estimated 3,900 pairs in 2011.

Little Solander Island in Foveaux Strait hosts the southernmost gannet colony, around 20 pairs recorded on most visits between 1948 and 1986, with one count of 62 pairs in 1984 possibly anomalous.

==Behaviour==
 The Australasian gannet is generally solitary when out at sea, though once a bird has found fish to hunt, other gannets may notice and join it. It is gregarious on land, nesting in colonies. Non-breeding gannets often form groups on the outskirts of the colony. Small numbers of gannets may remain around the colony site outside of the breeding season, using it as a roosting site.

===Breeding and courtship===

Gannet pairs form monogamous and long term bonds, and pairs may remain together over several seasons until one member dies, although they have been known to separate. The Australasian gannet is highly territorial when nesting, engaging in agonistic displays to mark their ground against neighbours and interlopers. In the bowing display, the male&#x27;s head and beak point down, and its wings are held up and away from the body, yet folded backwards. He moves his head from side to side before bowing forwards. The male may escalate by lunging at an interloper, either with a closed or open bill, or proceed to locking bills and wrestling for an extended period. Fights can be fatal on occasion. A bird may engage in an appeasement display to calm an attacker by lowering its head and tucking its bill in its chest.
Mated pairs engage in a fencing display when the male arrives back at the nest. The two birds stand breast to breast with wings spread and bills extended vertically. They fence and scissor with their bills rapidly, calling loudly at the same time. Fencing is interspersed with bill bowing. The birds generally follow this exchange with allopreening. Mated pairs also engage in &quot;sky-pointing&quot;, where a bird paces slowly with its neck and bill vertical and its wings partly raised. Copulation takes place after allopreening, the female shaking her head vigorously and the male biting her neck and climbing on her back and waving his wings before joining their cloacae. Afterwards the female preens the male, who slides off his partner and reciprocates preening.

The breeding season is generally from July to February, with marked differences between locations. On Motukaramarama Island, the gannets return in mid-June, laying eggs between 20 July and 7 August. The chicks hatch from 10 October to 2 November and fledge from late December. At Cape Kidnappers, the gannets return in late July, laying eggs from early September to the end of October. The chicks fledge from early February. At Pope&#x27;s Eye, gannets lay eggs between early August and December, the median and mean being laid in September. Younger parents tend to lay eggs later in the year than older parents. Within colonies, there is a wider variation in breeding dates compared to the northern gannet, thought to be due to the absence of a tight breeding &#x27;window&#x27; from strongly seasonal weather.

The preferred nesting sites are on flat or gently sloping ground or broad, flat ledges, on offshore islands, stacks or elevated areas on the mainland such as cliff-tops, generally between above sea level. The ground may be bare or bear low shrubs such as &quot;Coprosma&quot;, &quot;Mesembryanthemum&quot;, &quot;Bulbine&quot; or grasses. The nests themselves are cup-shaped mounds high with a deep basin, made from seaweed, plants, earth and debris from the sea. The males usually collect the materials and give them to the females, who construct the nests. One egg is laid that can weigh anywhere from , with an average of . Matt pale blue and with an elongated egg shape, it measures long by wide. The egg surface fades to a white when dry and it has a chalky coating. Generally, only one brood takes place each season, though eggs and chicks up to eight days old will be replaced if lost. Incubation takes 37–50 days and is done mainly by the female, keeping the eggs warm on top of her webbed feet.
Newly hatched chicks are featherless and have black skin, their eyes opening at 2–3 days of age. They are covered with white down by two weeks old. The first proper feathers to appear are flight feathers, which appear between days 43 and 47. The chick becomes half-covered by feathers by 9 weeks of age. Young chicks are fed regurgitated semi-digested fish by their parents, who open their mouths wide for their young to fetch the food from the back of their throats.

The young birds fledge 95–109 days after hatching, heading to a nearby clifftop and remaining there for anywhere from 6 hours to 3 days before flying. Weighing on average when born, they reach —exceeding that of adult birds—by day 50 and by day 90. Unlike young northern gannets, juvenile Australasian gannets are able to fly by the time they fledge and have fully grown primary flight feathers. They have smaller fat reserves, which may reflect a poorer food supply.

Young individuals return to the colonies when they are three years old, and begin breeding between four and seven years of age. The typical lifespan is estimated to be around 20 years. The maximum age recorded from banding has been 30 years 8.2 months; a bird tagged at Cape Kidnappers in January 1955 was found dead some away at Tangalooma in Moreton Bay, Queensland in September 1985. The longest distance travelled is ; a bird tagged at Lawrence Rocks was found washed ashore dead on the southeast coast of Mauritius.

===Feeding===
These birds are plunge divers and spectacular fishers, plunging from heights of up to 20 m (65 ft) into the ocean at high speed. They may dive from as low as 1–2 m (3–7 ft) above the surface at an angle to forage in water less than 3 m (10 ft) deep or in rough weather. They mainly eat forage fish which school near the surface, as well as cephalopods. Some local differences have been recorded: Australasian gannets at Farewell Spit mainly forage on coastal fish in water depths of less than , while those at Cape Kidnappers hunt more oceanic fish at water depths exceeding that. Birds also follow fishing vessels and trawlers to pick up discarded fish. Its bulk prevents it from hovering for a sustained period, but it can pause to examine the sea surface for fish.

The pilchard (&quot;Sardinops sagax&quot;) is a preferred prey item as it is an energy-rich source of food; after pilchard mass mortality events, Australasian gannets were able to adjust by switching to anchovy (&quot;Engraulis australis&quot;) at Farewell Spit in 1996 and barracouta (&quot;Thyrsites atun&quot;) in Port Phillip Bay in 1998. They also consumed correspondingly larger numbers of anchovies to maintain their caloric intake as this species has fewer calories than the pilchard. The increased expenditure for poorer return could feasibly impact on breeding success. In 1995, patrollers recovered 648 dead gannets along beaches in Auckland West and Northland West. The cause was unknown, but the 1995 pilchard mortality event and unusually strong westerly and southwesterly winds in July and August 1995 were implicated.

Other fish species reported eaten include kahawai (&quot;Arripis trutta&quot;), yellow-eye mullet (&quot;Aldrichetta forsteri&quot;), western Australian salmon (&quot;Arripis truttaceus&quot;), cape bonnetmouth (&quot;Emmelichthys nitidus&quot;), greenback horse mackerel (&quot;Trachurus declivis&quot;), yellowtail horse mackerel (&quot;Trachurus novaezelandiae&quot;), striped trumpeter (&quot;Latris lineata&quot;), New Zealand blueback sprat (&quot;Sprattus antipodum&quot;) and flyingfish of the genera &quot;Cheilopogon&quot; and &quot;Hirundichthys&quot;. Squid of the genus &quot;Nototodarus&quot; are among cephalopods eaten.

==Predators and parasites==
The southern giant petrel (&quot;Macronectes giganteus&quot;) has been recorded preying on an adult Australasian gannet by holding it underwater and drowning it. Eggs and chicks can fall victim to the kelp gull (&quot;Larus dominicanus&quot;) and Pacific gull (&quot;Larus pacificus&quot;), particularly if parent birds have been disturbed.

External parasites include the feather mite species &quot;Morinyssus simplex&quot;—collected from a museum skin of Australasian gannet—the bird louse species &quot;Pectinopygus bassani&quot;, and the tick species &quot;Ixodes eudyptidis&quot;, the widespread &quot;Ixodes uriae&quot; and &quot;Carios capensis&quot;.

==Conservation status==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the Australasian gannet as a species of least concern, as the population is large and appears to be growing. There are possible impacts from commercial fishing, though this is probably low compared with other seabirds. Survival rates each breeding season can vary dramatically, most likely due to food availability and weather. More frequent El Niño–Southern Oscillation events lead to warmer water in Bass Strait, which gives rise to more fish and hence accounting for the increase in Australian waters.

Gannets established a mainland colony on Young Nick&#x27;s Head near Gisborne, after decoys of nesting birds and pre-recorded calls were broadcast to passing gannets in September 2008. Successful breeding was recorded at the site from the 2010–11 breeding season onwards. A similar effort to establish a colony on Mana Island led to the arrival of a single gannet, dubbed Nigel &quot;no mates&quot;, who lived alone among the 80 decoys for several years until he was found dead in February 2018; in summer 2018, three more gannets arrived at the site. Gannets have been enticed to established breeding colonies by decoys at reserves on Motuora Island.

== Relationship with humans ==
The Māori were reported to have harvested young gannets for food, visiting Kārewa in March. The white feathers of adult gannets were used to adorn canoes, and were worn by important members of the community. The bones were made into tools to apply facial moko (tattoos).

Some mainland colonies have become tourist attractions, such as those at Cape Kidnappers / Te Kauwae-a-Māui, and Muriwai in New Zealand, and Point Danger in Australia. The gannets of Cape Kidnappers have featured on New Zealand stamps issued in 1958 and 2009.

<text>Pezinok (; in the local dialect &quot;Pezinek&quot;; ; ; ) is a town in southwestern Slovakia. It is roughly northeast of Bratislava and, as of December 2023, had a population of 24,443.

Pezinok lies near the Little Carpathians and thrives mainly on viticulture and agriculture, as well as on brick-making and ceramic(s) production.

==History==

From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Pezinok, or at least its surroundings, was for the first time mentioned in 1208 under name &quot;terra Bozin&quot;. During the next few centuries, the town changed from a mining settlement to a vineyard town. It gained the status of a free royal town on 14 June 1647. Pezinok had its most glorious era of wealth and prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries when it was also one of the richest towns in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its wealth was based on the production of quality wines. In the 19th century, the town slowly began to industrialize: the first sulphuric acid factory in Hungary or the known brickworks were established here. It boomed further after it was connected to the railway. After the breakup of Austria-Hungary in 1918/1920, the town became part of the newly created Czechoslovakia. In the first half of the 20th century, it was declining, vineyard production was declining, forcing many inhabitants to emigrate. It is growing again after the end of World War II. 

==Geography and tourism==
Pezinok lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in the Danubian Lowland at the foothills of the Little Carpathians, around north-east of Bratislava. Another major city, Trnava, is located around to the east.

A ski resort is situated on the &quot;Baba&quot; mountain. The neighbouring Little Carpathians offer numerous hiking paths. All of the city forests are part of the Little Carpathians Protected Landscape Area.

The Little Carpathians Museum (Malokarpatské múzeum), which is in a typical wine merchant&#x27;s house in the centre of the town, was undergoing a major renovation in 2008 and promises to be one of the best small museums in Slovakia.

It has the biggest collection of wine presses in central Europe, some of them gigantic wooden affairs dating from the early seventeenth century; the atmospheric old cellars of the building are partly given over to an exhibition of them.

But Martin Hrubala, the deputy director of the museum, is keen to make the museum not just about the old but also the new: the entrance fee includes a wine tasting, accompanied by a sommelier. And the museum promises interactivity at a level unusual for Slovak museums. Visitors, for instance, as well as tasting wine will also get the opportunity to make their own.

Pezinok seems to have been investing heavily in public facilities lately: the city museum, in a building opposite the Little Carpathians Museum, opened in 2003. It features a range of attractively presented local archaeological finds and a selection of stonework salvaged from nearby churches; labelling, however, is in Slovak only.

And at the northern end of the city centre, next to a park which once formed its landscaped grounds, is Pezinok Castle. Originally a moated fortress which was later turned into a chateau for the aristocratic Pálffy family, the cellars of the castle are now home to the National Wine Salon.

Little Carpathians Museum (&quot;Malokarpatské múzeum&quot;) is situated in Pezinok.

<doc id="962410" wikidata="Q920504" url="?curid=962410" title="Homework (Daft Punk album)">
<text>Homework is the debut studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 20 January 1997 by Virgin Records and Soma Quality Recordings. It was released in the US on 25 March 1997.

Daft Punk received attention from major labels after releasing several popular singles on Soma Quality Recordings, and signed to Virgin in 1996. Daft Punk initially planned to release the music as separate singles, but decided they had enough material for an album. According to the Daft Punk member Thomas Bangalter, the album title was a reference to the fact that it was recorded cheaply and quickly in their homes.

&quot;Homework&quot; charted in 14 countries, reaching number 3 on the French Albums Chart, number 150 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Da Funk&quot; and &quot;Around the World&quot; became U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club Play number-one singles, and &quot;Around the World&quot; reached number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. By February 2001, &quot;Homework&quot; had sold more than two million copies worldwide and received several gold and platinum certifications. It was influential on dance music and brought worldwide attention to French house.

==Background and recording==
In 1993, Daft Punk, comprising Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, presented a demo of their music to the DJ Stuart Macmillan at a rave at Disneyland Paris. The contents of the cassette, including the track &quot;Alive&quot;, were released on the single &quot;The New Wave&quot; on 11 April 1994, by Soma Quality Recordings, a Scottish techno and house label co-founded in 1991 by MacMillan&#x27;s band Slam. In 1995, Daft Punk released &quot;Da Funk&quot; and &quot;Rollin&#x27; &amp; Scratchin&#x27;&quot; on Soma.
The popularity of the singles led to a bidding war among record labels. Daft Punk signed to Virgin Records in 1996. Richard Brown of Soma said: &quot;We were obviously sad to lose them to Virgin but they had the chance to go big, which they wanted, and it&#x27;s not very often that a band has that chance after two singles. We&#x27;re happy for them.&quot; Virgin re-released &quot;Da Funk&quot; with the B-side &quot;Musique&quot; in 1996, a year before releasing &quot;Homework&quot;. Bangalter later said that the B-side &quot;was never intended to be on the album, and in fact, &#x27;Da Funk&#x27; as a single has sold more units than &quot;Homework&quot;, so more people own it anyways than they would if it had been on the album. It is basically used to make the single a double-feature.&quot; The album was mixed and recorded in Daft Punk&#x27;s studio, Daft House in Paris. It was mastered by Nilesh Patel at the London studio the Exchange.

Bangalter stated that &quot;to be free, we had to be in control. To be in control, we had to finance what we were doing ourselves. The main idea was to be free.&quot; Daft Punk discussed their method with Spike Jonze, the director of the &quot;Da Funk&quot; music video, who said: &quot;They were doing everything based on how they wanted to do it. As opposed to, &#x27;oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.&#x27; They wanted to make sure they never had to do anything that would make them feel bummed on making music.&quot; Although Virgin Records holds exclusive distribution rights over their material, Daft Punk owns their master recordings through their Daft Trax label.

==Music==
Daft Punk produced the tracks included in &quot;Homework&quot; without a plan to release an album. According to Bangalter, &quot;We did so many tracks over a period of five months that we realized that we had a good album.&quot; They set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP. Homem-Christo said, &quot;There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album.&quot; The name &quot;Homework&quot;, Bangalter explained, relates to &quot;the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff&quot;.
&quot;Daftendirekt&quot; is an excerpt of a live performance recorded in Ghent, Belgium. It served as the introduction to Daft Punk&#x27;s live shows and was used to begin the album. The performance took place at the first I Love Techno, an event co-produced by Fuse and On the Rox on 10 November 1995. &quot;Homework&quot;&#x27;s following track, &quot;WDPK 83.7 FM&quot;, is a tribute to FM radio in the United States. The next song, &quot;Revolution 909&quot; is a reflection on the French government&#x27;s stance on dance music. &quot;Revolution 909&quot; is followed by &quot;Da Funk&quot;, which carries elements of funk and acid music. According to Andrew Asch of the &quot;Boca Raton News&quot;, the song&#x27;s composition &quot;relies on a bouncy funk guitar to communicate its message of dumb fun&quot;. Bangalter expressed that &quot;Da Funk&quot;&#x27;s theme involved the introduction of a simple, unusual element that becomes acceptable and moving over time. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; complimented the song as &quot;unrelenting&quot;, and Bob Gajarsky of &quot;Consumable Online&quot; called it &quot;a beautiful meeting of Chic (circa &#x27;Good Times&#x27;, sans vocals) and the 90s form of electronica&quot;. 

&quot;Phoenix&quot; combines elements of gospel music and house music. Daft Punk considered &quot;Fresh&quot; breezy and light with a comical structure. &quot;Around the World&quot; carries influences of Gershon Kingsley&#x27;s hit &quot;Popcorn&quot;. Chris Power of BBC Music named it &quot;one of the decade&#x27;s catchiest singles&quot;. He stated that it was &quot;a perfect example of Daft Punk&#x27;s sound at its most accessible: a post-disco boogie bassline, a minimalist sprinkling of synthetic keyboard melody and a single, naggingly insistent hook&quot;. &quot;Teachers&quot; is a riff on the Parris Mitchell song &quot;Ghetto Shout Out!!&quot;, released in 1995 on Dance Mania. The track is a tribute to several of Daft Punk&#x27;s house music influences, including future collaborators Romanthony, DJ Sneak and Todd Edwards. &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; features DJ Deelat and DJ Crabbe. &quot;Indo Silver Club&quot; features a sample of &quot;Hot Shot&quot; by Karen Young. The final track, &quot;Funk Ad&quot;, is a reversed clip of &quot;Da Funk&quot;.

== Packaging ==
The artwork for the front cover and inner sleeve was conceived by Daft Punk and photographed by artist and film producer Nicolas Hidiroglou. He met the duo through a connection at Virgin Records, and recalled that it took a week to complete the artwork. Homem-Christo had previously designed the Daft Punk wordmark, which was the basis for the front image of the logo embroidered onto the back of a satin jacket. Variations of the logo would continue to be the front cover image for all of Daft Punk&#x27;s studio albums until &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; in 2013.

To create the inner gatefold photo, various items representing track titles were arranged by Bangalter on a table at his home. He noted that many of the pieces reflect Daft Punk&#x27;s influences, including: a DJ Funk audio cassette; a card with a logo of The Beach Boys; a Kiss tour poster; and a 1970s compilation record featuring Barry Manilow. Other mementos include a token from the Rex Club, the venue in Paris where Daft Punk first performed as DJs. The wall behind the table contains a photo of Homem-Christo singing as part of the duo&#x27;s first band Darlin&#x27;, as well as the Darlin&#x27; logo next to a portrait of Homem-Christo as a small child.

The black and white image of the duo in the liner notes was photographed by Phillppe Lévy. It was shot during an event in Wisconsin called &quot;Even Furthur&quot; in 1996, featuring Daft Punk&#x27;s first live performance in the United States. Additional artwork and the album layout were done by Serge Nicholas.

== Release ==
The first single, &quot;Alive&quot;, was included as a B-side on the single &quot;The New Wave&quot;, released in April 1994. The next single, &quot;Da Funk&quot;, was initially released in 1995 by Soma and was rereleased by Virgin Records in January 1997. It was Daft Punk&#x27;s first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club Play chart. The song reached number seven on British and French charts. The third single, &quot;Around the World&quot;, was Daft Punk&#x27;s second number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club Play chart, and reached number 11 in Australia, number five in the United Kingdom and number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

The fourth single, &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;, was released in September 1997 and reached number 30 in the UK. The final single, &quot;Revolution 909&quot;, was released in February 1998 and reached number 47 in the UK and number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club Play chart. Prior to its inclusion on &quot;Homework&quot;, &quot;Indo Silver Club&quot; was released as a single on the Soma Quality Recordings label in two parts. The single lacked an artist credit in the packaging and was thought to have been created by the nonexistent producers Indo Silver Club.

In 1999, Daft Punk released a video collection featuring music videos of tracks and singles from the album under the name of &quot;D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes&quot;. Although its title derives from the appearances of dogs (&quot;Da Funk&quot; and &quot;Fresh&quot;), androids (&quot;Around the World&quot;), firemen (&quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;), and tomatoes (&quot;Revolution 909&quot;) in the videos, a cohesive plot does not connect its episodes.

=== Sales ===
Daft Punk wanted the majority of pressings to be on vinyl, so only 50,000 albums were initially printed in CD format. After its release, production was accelerated to meet demand. &quot;Homework&quot; was distributed in 35 countries, reaching number 150 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It charted on the Australian Albums Chart on 27 April 1997; it remained there for eight weeks and reached number 37. In France, it reached number three and stayed on the chart for 82 weeks. By October 1997, &quot;Homework&quot; had sold 220,000 copies worldwide. In 1999, it was certified gold in France for selling more than 100,000 copies. On 11 July 2001, it was certified gold in the US for sales of 500,000 copies. According to Virgin Records, two million copies had been sold by February 2001. By September 2007, 605,000 copies had been sold in the US.

== Critical reception ==

David Browne, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, described the &quot;playful, hip-hopping ambient techno&quot; and said &quot;Homework&quot; was &quot;ideal disco for androids&quot;. Darren Gawle of &quot;Drop-D Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Homework&quot; is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; identified &quot;Da Funk&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, indicating &quot;a good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time as money&quot;. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;while a few tracks are more daft than deft&quot;, &quot;Da Funk&quot; had inspired acts such as the Avalanches. Sean Cooper of AllMusic called the album &quot;an almost certain classic&quot;. 

In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Homework&quot; the 65th-greatest album of the 1990s. In the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Douglas Wolk awarded &quot;Homework&quot; three out of five, writing that &quot;the duo&#x27;s essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that it was stupid but that it was not stupid enough&quot;. In the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, Alex Rayner wrote that &quot;Homework&quot; tied established club styles to the &quot;burgeoning eclecticism&quot; of big beat, and demonstrated that &quot;there was more to dance music than pills and keyboard presets&quot;. Ian Mathers of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;There&#x27;s a core of unimpeachably classic work on &quot;Homework&quot;, hidden among the merely good, and when you&#x27;ve got such a classic debut hidden in the outlines of the epic slouch of their debut, it&#x27;s hard not to get frustrated.&quot; 

In 2009, Brian Linder of &quot;IGN&quot; said &quot;Homework&quot; was &quot;groundbreaking achievement&quot;, praising the combination of house, techno, acid and punk. Reviewing it in 2010 for BBC Music, Chris Power compared &quot;Homework&quot; &quot;less-is-more&quot; use of compression as &quot;a sonic tribute&quot; to the FM radio stations that &quot;fed Daft Punk&#x27;s youthful obsessions&quot;. In 2011, Hua Hsu of eMusic praised the &quot;feeling of discovery and exploration&quot; as a result of &quot;years of careful study of the finest house, techno, electro and hip-hop records&quot;. That October, &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Around the World&quot; the 21st-best track of the preceding 15 years. In 2012, &quot;Clash&quot; described &quot;Homework&quot; as an entry point of accessibility for a &quot;burgeoning movement on the cusp of splitting the mainstream seam&quot;. 

In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Homework&quot; the greatest EDM album of all time, describing it as &quot;pure synapse-tweaking brilliance&quot;. In a second review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, in 2018, Larry Fitzmaurice awarded it 9.2 out of 10, writing: &quot;&quot;Homework&quot; remains singular within Daft Punk&#x27;s catalog, the record also set the stage for the duo&#x27;s career to this very day—a massively successful and still-going ascent to pop iconography, built on the magic trick-esque ability to twist the shapes of dance music&#x27;s past to resemble something seemingly futuristic.&quot; &quot;Homework&quot; success brought worldwide attention to French house music. According to Scott Woods of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula, and &quot;[tore] the lid off the [creative] sewer&quot;.

== &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot; ==

On 22 February 2022, one year after their breakup, Daft Punk updated their social media channels with cryptic posts leading fans to a newly created Twitch account. At 2:22pm UTC, a one-time only stream began of the duo&#x27;s full Daftendirektour performance at the Mayan Theater. At the same time, Daft Punk released an expanded 25th-anniversary edition of &quot;Homework&quot;. It includes remixes from DJ Sneak, Masters at Work, Todd Terry, Motorbass, Slam and Ian Pooley. The remixes were also simultaneously released as a separate remix album, &quot;Homework (Remixes)&quot;, with a physical release on 25 November 2022.

<text>Johann &quot;Joe&quot; van Niekerk (born 14 May 1980) is a South African former professional rugby union player who played either as a flanker or number 8.

== Career overview ==
After starring for the South Africa Schools, under-19, and under-21 sides, and captaining at all three levels, van Niekerk received the rare honour of being called up to the Springboks directly from the U21 side in 2001, in spite of never having played a game in either the Currie Cup or Super 12. He made his debut against the All Blacks in Cape Town.

Van Niekerk has experienced injury troubles throughout his senior-level career. When healthy, however, he is considered able to compete with virtually any back-row player in the world. He scored important tries for the Boks in home wins over the Wallabies in the 2002 Tri Nations Series and the 2004 Tri Nations Series. He has often been used as an &quot;impact player&quot; off the bench, especially in the 2005 Tri Nations Series.

In 2002, he was voted the South African &quot;Player of the Year&quot;. In the first match of the 2008 Tri Nations Series against the All Blacks in Wellington, he was a surprise choice to start at No. 8. He was expected to play for the Northampton Saints however his contract was terminated before he arrived, reportedly because of constant injury problems. In May 2013 he played as a replacement as Toulon won the 2013 Heineken Cup Final by 16–15 against Clermont Auvergne. After 2014 Heineken Cup Final van Niekerk has officially retired from rugby union.

Van Niekerk resides in Costa Rica and runs Rama Organica organic farm.

Bohunice NPP consists of two plants: V1 and V2; both contain two reactor units. The plant was connected to the national power network in stages in the period between 1978 and 1985. The four power reactors are pressurized water reactors of the Soviet VVER-440 design.

Annual electricity generation averages about 12,000 GWh. Upon development of a district heating supply network in the town of Trnava near Bohunice NPP, V2 switched to co-generation. Part of this system is a heat feeder line commissioned in 1987. In 1997, a heat feeder line to Leopoldov and Hlohovec was created, branching off from the Trnava line.

==Bohunice A1 (shut down)==
The A1 is a nuclear reactor situated on the Jaslovské Bohunice site. It was built between 1958 and 1972, and it was the first nuclear power plant in Czechoslovakia. It had one experimental reactor, the KS-150, designed in Czechoslovakia, which used non-enriched uranium as a fuel. Unlike conventional reactors, refuelling was carried out with the reactor in operation. From the beginning, however, there were many problems with the operation of the reactor, and a number of accidents occurred, related to the reactor&#x27;s experimental design. The first accident took place in 1976, during the replacement of fuel cells, costing the lives of two people. A second major accident, which received a fourth-degree rating by INES, occurred during refuelling on 22 February 1977. A decision was subsequently made to shut down the reactor, due to the high cost of repairs following the accident as well as inefficiency of operation. Czechoslovakia decided to build additional conventional Soviet reactors of the VVER type instead, which have a higher power output with a more efficient operational process. The A1 power plant was closed and began a decommissioning and cleanup process.

==Bohunice V1 (shut down)==
As a condition of accession into the European Union in 2004, Slovakia was required to deactivate the two reactors at the V1 plant. A provision in the accession treaty allowed for reactivation in case of an emergency.

The V1 plant was exempted from the sale of Slovenské Elektrárne to Enel and transferred to the Slovak Nuclear and Decommissioning Company (JAVYS), a national nuclear decommissioning company fully owned by the state. The first reactor was shut down at the end of 2006 and the second on the last day of 2008.

The Russia-Ukraine gas dispute in January 2009 disrupted natural gas supplies and electricity generation. On 10 January 2009, the Slovak government ordered the second reactor, then still undergoing a shutdown procedure, to be returned to power-generation-capable mode. The reactor was ultimately not reconnected to the grid, and the final shutdown resumed.

==Bohunice V2 (operating)==
Bohunice V2 consists of two second-generation VVER-440/213 units that went online on 20 August 1984 and 18 December 1985, respectively. In November 2010, both reactors were uprated from 440 MW to 505 MW (gross electrical output), and operation is planned to be maintained until 2025.

==Bohunice V3 (planned)==
In May 2009, Slovak prime minister Robert Fico and Czech PM Jan Fischer announced construction of a new reactor unit at Bohunice. A partnership of JAVYS and the Czech energy company ČEZ will build the plant at a projected cost of around 3.7 billion euros. Specification of the new reactor have not been settled upon but will be rated at between 600 and 1,600 MWe. Four manufacturers have been mooted as possible suppliers: Mitsubishi, Atomenergoprojekt, Westinghouse, and Areva. At the time, ČEZ considered combining this project with their concurrent construction of the third and fourth reactors at Temelín Nuclear Power Station, which was ultimately canceled in April 2013.

<text>Bryggenet is a community network in the Islands Brygge quarter of Copenhagen, Denmark. Bryggenet serves an area of about 4000 residences with fast Internet access, cable TV and radio, and telephone services at cost prices.

Bryggenet was started in 2001 by a group of volunteers, initially with the intent of providing fast and cheap internet access to the residents of a number of co-ops in the quarter, but the project quickly expanded into TV and telephone. All three services went live in early 2003 and have now been working for over 7 years, generally quite well. Since the start, still more co-ops and housing estates have signed up. As of mid-2005 more than 3500 apartments take part.

Internet access is provided in two sizes: &#x27;basic internet&#x27; with 70 Mbit/s per 1000 subscribers, and &#x27;fast internet&#x27; with 280 Mbit/s per 1000 subscribers. Prices are currently approx. $10/month and $25/month flat fee.

Cable TV is also available in two sizes: &#x27;small&#x27; with 8 must-carry or inexpensive channels (Danish, local and Scandinavian); and &#x27;large&#x27; with 36 channels (Danish, local, Scandianvian, English, US, German, French, Spanish, Arabic and various thematic channels). The exact composition of each package is determined by subscriber votes every few years. Prices are approx. $7/month and $25/month.

Telephone lines are provided by normal analog technology. A subscription is approx. $7/month and call rates approx. 20% lower than most commercial operators. Local calls are free of charge.

Bryggenet owns the infrastructure. The backbone is a net of fibre optic cables throughout the area, connecting each member building. The internal wiring of each building are normal cat5 PDS cables for internet and telephone, and television. Internet access is provided by a fibre optic cable to Teliasonera, one of the major Scandinavian telecom players; TV and radio signals are delivered via a set of satellite dishes locally; and telephone lines by pools of ISDN lines.

All in all Bryggenet represents an investment of about $2 million, plus countless working hours of the volunteers.

<text>Midway, released in the United Kingdom as Battle of Midway, is a 1976 American war film that chronicles the Battle of Midway, a turning point in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II. Directed by Jack Smight and produced by Walter Mirisch from a screenplay by Donald S. Sanford, the film starred Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda, supported by a large international cast of guest stars including James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Ed Nelson, Hal Holbrook, Robert Webber, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner, Pat Morita, Dabney Coleman, Erik Estrada and Tom Selleck.

The film was made using Technicolor, and its soundtrack used Sensurround to augment the physical sensation of engine noise, explosions, crashes and gunfire. Despite mixed reviews, particularly involving the use of stock footage and an unnecessary romance subplot, the music score by John Williams and the cinematography by Harry Stradling Jr. were highly regarded; as evidenced when &quot;Midway&quot; became the tenth most popular movie at the box office in 1976.

==Plot==
On April 18, 1942, a squadron of B-25 bombers from the launches a raid on Tokyo. The strike stuns the Imperial Japanese Navy and its commander Admiral Yamamoto. With hard evidence of the threat posed to the Japanese home islands by the carriers of the American Pacific Fleet, Yamamoto is permitted to use his plan to invade Midway Island. At Pearl Harbor, Captain Matt Garth is tasked with gauging the progress of decryption efforts at Station HYPO, headed by Commander Joseph Rochefort, which has partially cracked the Japanese Navy&#x27;s JN-25 code, revealing a location the Japanese refer to as &quot;AF&quot;. Garth is asked by his son, naval aviator Ensign Tom Garth, to help free his girlfriend Haruko Sakura, an American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, who has been interned with her parents, by calling in favors to have the charges against the family dropped. Yamamoto and his staff present their plans for Midway to the commanders who have been chosen to lead the attack, Admirals Nagumo and Yamaguchi of the Japanese carrier force and Admiral Kondo of the invasion force.

After the inconclusive Battle of the Coral Sea, Rochefort uses a simple ruse to confirm that &quot;AF&quot; is Midway. Knowing the location of the attack, Admiral Nimitz and his staff send the carriers and , augmented by , hastily-repaired after being damaged at Coral Sea, to a point north of Midway and lie in wait for the Japanese fleet. Meanwhile, Matt has been unsuccessful in freeing the Sakuras, infuriating Tom.

On June 4, the Japanese fleet is spotted by scouts; the American carriers launch their planes in response. Nagumo&#x27;s carrier force launches its air attack on Midway Island. The American base is damaged but the airstrip remains usable, meaning Midway can still launch aircraft. Nagumo learns of a sighting by a scout plane of the &quot;Yorktown&quot;, disrupting his plans for a second strike on Midway; he orders that his planes be rapidly re-armed with torpedoes for an attack on the American carrier. Torpedo bombers find the Japanese fleet and attack without fighter protection and are destroyed by the Japanese Combat Air Patrol, leaving only a single survivor, George H. Gay Jr.. When American escort fighters cover another wave of torpedo bombers, Tom is wounded and severely burned. The Japanese fighters are drawn down to wave-top altitude by the low-flying torpedo planes, leaving them out of position when dive-bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; arrive. As the Japanese prepare to launch their second wave, the American bombers attack and reduce three of the Japanese carriers – , and – to burning wrecks. Nagumo, having received a concussion, is told to transfer his flag to cruiser .

The remaining Japanese carrier launches aircraft. Following the returning American bombers, the Japanese find &quot;Yorktown&quot; and inflict severe damage. The crew manage to bring the fires under control as a scout plane reports that &quot;Hiryū&quot; has been spotted. Below decks, Matt meets Tom and reconciles with him. Due to a shortage of pilots, Matt joins the counterattack against &quot;Hiryū&quot; just before its second wave of aircraft strikes. &quot;Yorktown&quot; is crippled and the order is given to abandon ship. &quot;Hiryū&quot; is reduced to a burning wreck, and Yamamoto, during a general withdrawal, takes responsibility of apologising for the failure to the Emperor. Returning to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Matt, his plane badly damaged, is killed when the plane crashes. As &quot;Enterprise&quot; docks at Pearl Harbor, the injured younger Garth is carried off the ship, seen by Haruko, as Nimitz and Rochefort reflect on the battle. Nimitz suggests that Matt would have noted that Yamamoto &quot;had everything going for him&quot;, and asked &quot;were we better than the Japanese, or just luckier?&quot;

==Cast==

=== Allies ===
=== Japanese ===
=== Civilians ===
==Production==
===Development===
John Guillermin was reportedly hired to direct but was replaced by Jack Smight before filming began. Naval aviator Lieutenant Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Best and Joseph Rochefort served as consultants; George Gay, the only survivor of Torpedo Squadron 8, visited during filming. Toshiro Mifune sent his script to Minoru Genda and to Yamamoto’s son, so that they could attest to its historical accuracy. Reportedly, Mifune had been scheduled to play Yamamoto in &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), but withdrew when director Akira Kurosawa left the project. The filmmakers wanted to portray the Japanese in a fair light and to portray them and the Americans as equals. Principal photography was scheduled to end around 20 July 1975. Filming at sea took three weeks, which included shooting on the U.S.S. Lexington, the last World War II ship in service. Robert Mitchum settled on filming his scenes in bed. Modern crew members of the U.S.S. Lexington were persuaded to have their hair cut and to shave to conform to World War II Navy regulations after watching the filming. Fonda was astonished to learn that Yamamoto and Nimitz were missing fingers from accidents. Fonda consciously folded back his finger throughout his performance and Mifune had his uniforms and gloves made to be accurate as possible. In the original script, Garth survived.

===Filming===
&quot;Midway&quot; was shot at the Terminal Island Naval Base, Los Angeles, California, the U.S. Naval Station, Long Beach, California, Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida and San Diego, California. The on-board scenes were filmed in the Gulf of Mexico aboard . &quot;Lexington&quot;, an , was the last World War II-era carrier left in service at that point, although the ship was completed after the battle. She is now a museum ship at Corpus Christi, Texas. Scenes depicting Midway Island were filmed at Point Mugu, California. &quot;Point Mugu has sand dunes, just like Midway. We built an airstrip, a tower, some barricades, things like that,&quot; said Jack Smight. &quot;We did a lot of strafing and bombing there.&quot; A Consolidated PBY-6A Catalina BuNo &quot;63998&quot;, N16KL, of the Commemorative Air Force, was used in depicting all the search and rescue mission scenes.

===Sound===
The film was the second of only four films released with a Sensurround sound mix which required special speakers to be installed in movie theatres. The other Sensurround films were &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1974), &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1977), and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978). The regular soundtrack (dialog, background and music) was monaural; a second optical track was devoted to low frequency rumble added to battle scenes and when characters were near unmuffled military engines.

===Action===

Many of the action sequences used footage from earlier films: most sequences of the Japanese air raids on Midway are stock shots from 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970). Some scenes are from the Japanese &quot;Toho&quot; film &quot;Hawai Middouei daikaikusen: Taiheiyo no arashi&quot; (1960) (which also stars Mifune). Several action scenes, including the one where a Mitsubishi A6M Zero slams into &#x27;s bridge, were taken from &quot;Away All Boats&quot; (1956); scenes of Doolittle&#x27;s Tokyo raid at the beginning of the film are from &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944). In addition, most dogfight sequences come from wartime gun camera footage or from the film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969).

The US Navy &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carrier USS &quot;Lexington&quot; played the part of both American and Japanese flattops for shipboard scenes.

===Television version===
Shortly after its successful theatrical debut, additional material was assembled and shot in standard 4:3 ratio for a TV version of the film, which aired on NBC. The TV version was 45 minutes longer than the theatrical film and aired over two nights. In the TV version of the film, Susan Sullivan played Ann, the girlfriend of Captain Garth, to add depth to his reason for previously divorcing Ensign Garth&#x27;s mother, and restored a cut scene from the theatrical release that clarifies that Garth suffered a hand injury in the Pearl Harbor attack that has kept him out of flying, to bring further emotional impact to the fate of Captain Garth. Ann is seen in the final scene as &quot;Hornet&quot; docks at Pearl Harbor.

The TV version also added Coral Sea battle scenes to help the plot build up to the decisive engagement at Midway. Mitchell Ryan played Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch aboard the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; and Jim Ishida played Takeo Koda, a Japanese pilot and old friend of Nagumo. After the raid on Tokyo, Koda meets Nagumo to express his doubts that Japan might be able to win the war. Koda is killed in the Coral Sea battle, and Yamaguchi informs Nagumo about the defeat at Coral Sea. Prior to the Midway battle, the cautious Nagumo ruminates on Koda to Genda.

Jack Smight directed the additional scenes. The end credits of the TV version use the song, &quot;The Men of the Yorktown March&quot; (which is more prominent in the film&#x27;s underscore), instead of the &quot;Midway March&quot;.

In June 1992, a re-edit of the extended version, shortened to fill a three-hour time slot, aired on the CBS network to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Midway battle. This version brought in successful ratings.

Later video versions dropped Sullivan to emphasize the essentially all-male cast and wartime action. The additional footage with Sullivan became available as a bonus feature on the Universal Pictures Home Entertainment DVD of &quot;Midway&quot;. The full version was given a dual-format release by Powerhouse Films in 2021.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Midway&quot; proved extremely popular with movie audiences, and opened at number one at the US box office with an opening weekend gross of $4,356,666 from 311 theatres. It went on to gross over $43 million at the US box office, becoming the tenth most popular movie of 1976 with theatrical rentals of $20,300,000. Internationally, it grossed $57 million for a worldwide gross of $100 million.

===Critical response===
Critical response was unenthusiastic.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;The movie can be experienced as pure spectacle, I suppose, if we give up all hopes of making sense of it. Bombs explode and planes crash and the theater shakes with the magic of Sensurround. But there&#x27;s no real directorial intelligence at hand to weave the special effects into the story, to clarify the outlines of the battle and to convincingly account for the unexpected American victory.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the movie blows up harmlessly in a confusion of familiar old newsreel footage, idiotic fiction war movie clichés, and a series of wooden-faced performances by almost a dozen male stars, some of whom appear so briefly that it&#x27;s like taking a World War II aircraft-identification test.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; thought that the film &quot;emerges more as a passingly exciting theme-park extravaganza than a quality motion picture action-adventure story ... Donald S. Sanford&#x27;s cluttered script, while striving for the long-ago personal element, gets overwhelmed by its action effects.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that &quot;[t]he battle scenes run hot and cold.&quot; He praised Henry Fonda as &quot;absolutely convincing&quot; but stated that Sanford &quot;deserves a year in the brig for inserting amid the battle scenes a stupid subplot involving a young American sailor in love with a Japanese-American girl.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;tired combat epic&quot; and wrote, &quot;Hollywood may mean well, or imagine it does, but it&#x27;s a little appalling to think that authentic acts of bravery and sacrifice have become the pretext for such feeble, inadequate dramatization. There is no serious attempt in &#x27;Midway&#x27; to characterize the young men who fought on either side of this pivotal battle.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was mixed, describing it as &quot;a disaster film whose disaster is war,&quot; with its principal strength being that it &quot;keeps the lines of battle both straight and suspenseful in the viewer&#x27;s mind.&quot; He too faulted the romance subplot as &quot;hokey even beyond the demands of the form.&quot; Janet Maslin panned the film in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, stating that it &quot;never quite decides whether war is hell, good clean fun, or merely another existential dilemma. This drab extravaganza toys with so many conflicting attitudes that it winds up reducing the pivotal World War II battle in the Pacific to utter nonsense.&quot;

Robert Niemi, author of &quot;History in the Media: Film and Television&quot;, stated that &quot;Midway&quot;&#x27;s &quot;clichéd dialogue&quot; and an overuse of stock footage led the film to have a &quot;shopworn quality that signalled the end of the heroic era of American-made World War II epics.&quot; He described the film as a &quot;final, anachronistic attempt to recapture World War II glories in a radically altered geopolitical era, when the old good-versus-evil dichotomies no longer made sense.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 41% score based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10.

== Historical accuracy ==
More flag officers took part at the decision making and planning before the battle, not just Nimitz, Fletcher and Spruance. All the same, commanding officers&#x27; staffs were generally bigger than the one or two men portrayed in the movie. Admiral Ernest King, commander-in-chief of the navy, approved the Midway battle plan propounded by Nimitz. They were regularly in contact, so there was no need of sending fictional Capt. Vinton Maddox to consult Nimitz. The failure of Midway-based aircraft&#x27;s attacks on approaching Japanese fleets convinced Japanese commanders of their own invincibility and the incompetence of the US military.

During the American torpedo attacks, Admiral Nagumo remarks, &quot;They sacrifice themselves like samurai, these Americans.&quot; Similar to Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s sleeping giant quote from the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, there is no evidence that Nagumo made this statement. When the &quot;Akagi&quot; is bombed, Nagumo suffers a concussion, and is tended to by Genda. In reality, according to witnesses, Nagumo stood near the ship&#x27;s compass looking out at the destruction.

The film omits that the Japanese destroyer that inadvertently guided US dive bombers to the carriers had attacked U.S. submarine , which had tried to attack the battleship .

Later studies by Japanese and American military historians call into question key scenes, such as the dive-bombing attack that crippled the first three Japanese carriers. In the movie, American pilots jubilantly report that there are no fighters and the carrier decks are loaded with ammunition. As Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully write in &quot;Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway&quot; (2005), aerial photography from the battle showed nearly empty decks. Japanese carriers loaded armament onto planes below the flight deck, unlike American carriers (as depicted earlier in the film). The fact that a closed hangar full of armaments was hit by bombs made damage to &quot;Akagi&quot; more devastating than if planes, torpedoes and bombs were on an open deck. During the attack on the Japanese carriers, an American pilot reports, &quot;Scratch one flat top!&quot; This is a famous radio transmission but it was made a month earlier during the Battle of the Coral Sea by Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon after his dive bomber squadron sank the .

While most characters are based on real people, some are fictional though inspired by actual people. Captain Matt Garth and his son, Ensign Thomas Garth, are fictional. Garth&#x27;s contribution to planning the battle is based loosely on actual work of Lieutenant-Commander Edwin Layton. Layton served as Pacific fleet intelligence officer, spoke Japanese and was key to transposing raw outputs of cryptography analysis into meaningful intelligence for Nimitz and his staff. Layton was an old friend of Joseph Rochefort. Matt Garth&#x27;s further exploits were pure fiction and resembled deeds of at least two more figures: first, an intelligence officer on Fletcher&#x27;s Task Force 17 staff, and then the leader of the last attack made by dive bombers from USS &quot;Yorktown&quot;, by the VB-3 dive bomber squadron led by LCDR Maxwell Leslie. 

There are numerous inaccuracies both in the use of historical combat footage and recreations. Most of the original footage portrays later and/or different events, and thus planes and ships that either were not operational during the battle or did not take part. Among the first aircraft shown taking off to defend Midway are two Army P-40 Warhawks: only Marine F4F Wildcats and F2A-3 Buffalos had been stationed there. In the second air attack on &quot;Yorktown&quot;, the movie shows two Japanese &quot;kamikazes&quot; crashing into the aircraft carrier; there were no plane crashes into ships in this battle. In addition, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was damaged and sunk by torpedoes fired from a Japanese submarine which had penetrated the destroyer screen, rather than survived the air attack seen in the film. A nearby destroyer, , also was attacked, sending more than 100 men into the sea and sinking in just four minutes. One of the most flagrant misrepresentations is Garth&#x27;s collision at the very end of the movie, which is followed by footage of a Grumman F9F Panther jet plane crash which actually occurred on in 1951. 

Like the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; used in filming, USS &quot;Midway&quot; is also preserved as a museum.
