<text>The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni or kaama, is an African antelope. It is the only member of the genus Alcelaphus. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of . The weight ranges from . It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly-shaped horns, a short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of . Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. A conspicuous hump over the shoulders is due to the long dorsal processes of the vertebrae in this region.

Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Inhabiting dry savannas and wooded grasslands, hartebeest often move to more arid places after rainfall. They have been reported from altitudes on Mount Kenya up to . The hartebeest was formerly widespread in Africa, but populations have undergone a drastic decline due to habitat destruction, hunting, human settlement, and competition with livestock for food. Each of the eight subspecies of the hartebeest has a different conservation status. The Bubal hartebeest was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1994. While the populations of the red hartebeest are on the rise, those of the Tora hartebeest, already Critically Endangered, are falling. The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, and Tunisia; but has been introduced into Eswatini and Zimbabwe. It is a popular game animal due to its highly regarded meat.

== Etymology ==
The vernacular name &quot;hartebeest&quot; may have originated from the obsolete Dutch word &quot;hertebeest&quot;, literally &quot;deer beast&quot;, based on the resemblance (to early Dutch settlers) of the antelope to deer. The first use of the word &quot;hartebeest&quot; in South African literature was in Dutch colonial administrator Jan van Riebeeck&#x27;s journal &quot;Daghregister&quot; in 1660. He wrote: &quot;&quot;Meester Pieter ein hart-beest geschooten hadde&quot; (Master Pieter [van Meerhoff] had shot one hartebeest)&quot;. Another name for the hartebeest is &quot;kongoni&quot;, a Swahili word. &quot;Kongoni&quot; is often used to refer in particular to one of its subspecies, Coke&#x27;s hartebeest.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name of the hartebeest is &quot;Alcelaphus buselaphus&quot;. First described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766, it is classified in the genus &quot;Alcelaphus&quot; and placed in the family Bovidae. In 1979, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba supported &quot;Sigmoceros&quot; as a separate genus for Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest, a kind of hartebeest, as she assumed it was related to &quot;Connochaetes&quot; (wildebeest). She had analysed the skull characters of living and extinct species of antelope to make a cladogram, and argued that a wide skull linked Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest with &quot;Connochaetes&quot;. However, this finding was not replicated by Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, who classified it as an independent species of &quot;Alcelaphus&quot;. Zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon and Theodor Haltenorth considered it to be a subspecies of &quot;A. buselaphus&quot;. Vrba dissolved the new genus in 1997 after reconsideration. An MtDNA analysis could find no evidence to support a separate genus for Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest. It also showed the tribe Alcelaphini to be monophyletic, and discovered close affinity between the &quot;Alcelaphus&quot; and the sassabies (genus &quot;Damaliscus&quot;)—both genetically and morphologically.
===Subspecies===
Eight subspecies are identified, of which two – &quot;A. b. caama&quot; and &quot;A. b. lichtensteinii&quot; – have been considered to be independent species. However, a 1999 genetic study by P. Arctander of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues, which sampled the control region of the mitochondrial DNA, found that these two formed a clade within &quot;A. buselaphus&quot;, and that recognising these as species would render &quot;A. buselaphus&quot; paraphyletic (an unnatural grouping). The same study found &quot;A. b. major&quot; to be the most divergent, having branched off before the lineage split to give a combined &quot;caama/lichtensteinii&quot; lineage and another that gave rise to the remaining extant subspecies. Conversely a 2001 phylogenetic study, based on D–loop and cytochrome b analysis by Øystein Flagstad (of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, Trondheim) and colleagues, found that the southern lineage of &quot;A. b. caama&quot; and &quot;A. lichtensteinii&quot; diverged earliest. Analysis of skull structure supports partition into three major divisions: &quot;A. b. buselaphus&quot; division (nominate, also including &quot;A. b. major&quot; division), &quot;A. b. tora&quot; division (also including &quot;A. b. cokii&quot; and &quot;A. b. swaynei&quot;) and &quot;A. b. lelwel&quot; division. Another analysis of cytochrome b and D-loop sequence data shows a notable affinity between the &quot;A. b. lelwel&quot; and &quot;A. b. tora &quot; divisions.

The eight subspecies, including the two controversial ones, are:

* † A. b. buselaphus : Known as the bubal hartebeest or northern hartebeest. Formerly occurred across northern Africa, from Morocco to Egypt. It was exterminated by the 1920s. It was declared extinct in 1994 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).
* A. b. caama : Known as the red hartebeest or Cape hartebeest. Formerly occurred in southern Angola; northern and eastern savannahs of Namibia; central, southern and southwestern Botswana; Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Free State, Northwest and Gauteng provinces and western KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa. Presently has been eliminated from all these areas except Northern Cape, central and southwestern Botswana and Namibia. Major re-introductions have taken place in these countries. The population of this hartebeest is on the rise.
* A. b. cokii : Known as Coke&#x27;s hartebeest or kongoni. Native to and confined within Kenya and northern Tanzania.
* A. b. lelwel : Known as the Lelwel hartebeest. Formerly found in northern and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo; southeastern and southwestern Sudan; and the northwestern extreme of Tanzania. Drastic population decrease since the 1980s has confined most individuals to protected areas inside and outside its range.
* A. b. lichtensteinii : Known as Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest. Inhabits the miombo woodlands of eastern and southern Africa. It is native to Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
* A. b. major : Known as the western hartebeest. Formerly occurred widely in Mali, Niger, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, southwestern Chad, Cameroon, western Central African Republic and Benin. Nowadays it occurs in much lower numbers mainly in protected areas of these countries. It is probably extinct in Gambia.
* A. b. swaynei : Known as Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest. Restricted to the southern Rift Valley in Ethiopia, confirmed and listed as an endemic species. It formerly occurred throughout the Rift Valley, and its range extended eastward into northwestern Somalia. It disappeared from Somalia by 1930 due to the outcome of the rinderpest epidemic, illegal poaching, and livestock overgrazing. Confirmed as endangered species, its populations are low with at least 1500 individuals, and on verge of population decline.
* A. b. tora : Known as the tora hartebeest. Formerly occurred in northwestern Ethiopia and western and southwestern Eritrea. Its present status is unclear, though locals have reported small numbers from these areas.

===Genetics and hybrids===

In 2000, a study scrutinised two major populations of the Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for mitochondrial (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability in an attempt to estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population in both the protected areas.

The diploid number of chromosomes in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest have been reported in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (&quot;Damaliscus pygargus&quot;) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.

There are three well-defined hybrids between the subspecies:

* &quot;Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii&quot;: Known as the Kenya Highland hartebeest or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a cross between the Lelwel and Coke&#x27;s hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke&#x27;s hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is longer than in Coke&#x27;s hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer than those of the parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.
* The Jackson&#x27;s hartebeest does not have a clear taxonomic status. Like the form above, it is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke&#x27;s hartebeest, and has a similar distribution. The &quot;African Antelope Database&quot; (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest. From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson&#x27;s hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to the southern part of the Rift Valley it tends to be more like the Coke&#x27;s hartebeest.
* &quot;Alcelaphus lelwel x swaynei&quot; : Also known as the Neumann&#x27;s hartebeest, named after traveller and hunter Arthur Henry Neumann. This is considered to be a cross between the Lelwel hartebeest and Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest. The face is longer than that of the Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest. The colour of the coat is a golden brown, paler towards the underparts. The chin has a hint of black and the tail ends in a black tuft. Both sexes have longer horns than the Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest. The horns grow in a wide &quot;V&quot; shape, unlike the wide bracket shape of Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest and the narrow &quot;V&quot; of Lelwel hartebeest, curving backward and slightly inward. It occurs in Ethiopia, in a small area to the east of Omo River and north of Lake Turkana, stretching north-east of Lake Chew Bahir to near Lake Chamo.

==Evolution==
The genus &quot;Alcelaphus&quot; emerged about 4.4 million years ago in a clade whose other members were &quot;Damalops&quot;, &quot;Numidocapra&quot;, &quot;Rabaticeras&quot;, &quot;Megalotragus&quot;, &quot;Oreonagor&quot;, and &quot;Connochaetes&quot;. An analysis using phylogeographic patterns within hartebeest populations suggested a possible origin of &quot;Alcelaphus&quot; in eastern Africa. &quot;Alcelaphus&quot; quickly radiated across the African savannas, replacing several previous forms (such as a relative of the hirola). Flagstad and colleagues showed an early split in the hartebeest populations into two distinct lineages around 0.5 million years ago – one to the north and the other to the south of the equator. The northern lineage further diverged into eastern and western lineages, nearly 0.4 million years ago, most probably as a result of the expanding central African rainforest belt and subsequent contraction of savanna habitats during a period of global warming. The eastern lineage gave rise to the Coke&#x27;s, Swayne&#x27;s, Tora and Lelwel hartebeest; and from the western lineage evolved the Bubal and western hartebeest. The southern lineage gave rise to Lichtenstein&#x27;s and red hartebeest. These two taxa are phylogenetically close, having diverged only 0.2 million years ago. The study concluded that these major events throughout the hartebeest&#x27;s evolution are strongly related to climatic factors, and that there had been successive bursts of radiation from a more permanent population—a refugium—in eastern Africa; this could be vital to understanding the evolutionary history of not only the hartebeest but also other mammals of the African savanna.

The earliest fossil record dates back to nearly 0.7 million years ago. Fossils of the red hartebeest have been found in Elandsfontein, Cornelia (Free State) and Florisbad in South Africa, as well as in Kabwe in Zambia. In Israel, hartebeest remains have been found in northern Negev, Shephelah, Sharon Plain and Tel Lachish. This population of the hartebeest was originally limited to the open country of the southernmost regions of the southern Levant. It was probably hunted in Egypt, which affected the numbers in the Levant, and disconnected it from its main population in Africa.

==Description==
A large antelope with a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, the hartebeest stands just over at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of . The weight ranges from . The tail, long, ends in a black tuft. The other distinctive features of the hartebeest are its long legs (often with black markings), short neck, and pointed ears. A study correlated the size of hartebeest species to habitat productivity and rainfall. The western hartebeest is the largest subspecies, and has a characteristic white line between the eyes. The red hartebeest is also large, with a black forehead and a contrasting light band between the eyes. The large Lelwel hartebeest has dark stripes on the front of its legs. Coke&#x27;s hartebeest is moderately large, with a shorter forehead and longer tail in comparison to the other subspecies. Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest is smaller, with dark stripes on the front of the legs, as in the Lelwel hartebeest. The Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest is smaller than the Tora hartebeest, but both have a shorter forehead and similar appearance.

Generally short and shiny, the coat varies in colour according to subspecies. The western hartebeest is a pale sandy-brown, but the front of the legs are darker. The red hartebeest is a reddish-brown, with a dark face. Black markings can be observed on the chin, the back of the neck, shoulders, hips and legs; these are in sharp contrast with the broad white patches that mark its flanks and lower rump. The Lelwel hartebeest is a reddish tan. Coke&#x27;s hartebeest is reddish to tawny in the upper parts, but has relatively lighter legs and rump. Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest is reddish brown, though the flanks are a lighter tan and the rump whitish. The Tora hartebeest is a dark reddish brown in the upper part of the body, the face, the forelegs and the rump, but the hindlegs and the underbelly are a yellowish white. The Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest is a rich chocolate brown with fine spots of white that are actually the white tips of its hairs. Its face is black save for the chocolate band below the eyes. The shoulders and upper part of the legs are black. Fine textured, the body hair of the hartebeest is about long. The hartebeest has preorbital glands (glands near the eyes) with a central duct, that secrete a dark sticky fluid in Coke&#x27;s and Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest, and a colourless fluid in the Lelwel hartebeest.

Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of ; the maximum horn length is , recorded from a Namibian red hartebeest. The horns of the western hartebeest are thick and appear U-shaped from the front and Z-shaped from the sides, growing backward at first and then forward, ending with a sharp backward turn. The horns of the red and the Lelwel hartebeest are similar to those of the western hartebeest, but appear V-shaped when viewed from the front. The Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest has thick parallel ringed horns, with a flat base. Its horns are shorter than those of other subspecies, curving upward then sharply forward, followed by an inward turn at an angle of about 45° and a final backward turn. The horns of Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest are thin and shaped like parentheses, curving upward and then backward. The horns of the Tora hartebeest are particularly thin and spread out sideways, diverging more than in any other subspecies.

Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus &quot;Damaliscus&quot;), such as an elongated and narrow face, the shape of the horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne&#x27;s and Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Active mainly during daytime, the hartebeest grazes in the early morning and late afternoon, and rests in shade around noon. Gregarious, the species forms herds of up to 300 individuals. Larger numbers gather in places with abundant grass. In 1963, a congregation of 10,000 animals was recorded on the plains near Sekoma Pan in Botswana. However, moving herds are not so cohesive, and tend to disperse frequently. The members of a herd can be divided into four groups: territorial adult males, non-territorial adult males, young males, and the females with their young. The females form groups of five to 12 animals, with four generations of young in the group. Females fight for dominance over the herd. Sparring between males and females is common. At three or four years of age, the males can attempt to take over a territory and its female members. A resident male defends his territory and will fight if provoked. The male marks the border of his territory through defecation. 

Hartebeest are remarkably alert and cautious animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual stays on the lookout for danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.

The thin long legs of the hartebeest provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used to ward off the predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.

Like the sassabies, hartebeest produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles tend to be more vocal than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.

===Parasites and diseases===
Several parasites have been isolated from the hartebeest. These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest. Hartebeest can be infected with theileriosis due to &quot;Rhipicephalus evertsi&quot; and &quot;Theileria&quot; species. South of the Sahara, common parasites include &quot;Loewioestrus variolosus&quot;, &quot;Gedoelstia cristata&quot; and &quot;G. hassleri&quot;. The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis. However, parasites are not always harmful – 252 larvae were found in the head of one Zambian individual without any pathogenicity. Nematodes, cestodes, paramphistomes; and the roundworm &quot;Setaria labiatopapillosa&quot; have also been isolated from the hartebeest. In 1931, a red hartebeest in Gobabis (southwestern Africa) was infected with long, thin worms. These were named &quot;Longistrongylus meyeri&quot; after their collector, T. Meyer.
===Diet===
Hartebeest are primarily grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A study in the Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest&#x27;s skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than the other members of Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation across Africa.

Grasses generally comprise at least 80 per cent of the hartebeest&#x27;s diet, but they account for over 95 per cent of their food in the wet season, October to May. &quot;Jasminum kerstingii&quot; is part of the hartebeest&#x27;s diet at the start of the rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest a higher proportion of food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.

In a study of grass selectivity among the wildebeest, zebra, and the Coke&#x27;s hartebeest, the hartebeest showed the highest selectivity. All animals preferred &quot;Themeda triandra&quot; over &quot;Pennisetum mezianum&quot; and &quot;Digitaria macroblephara&quot;. More grass species were eaten in the dry season than in the wet season.

===Reproduction===

Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year, with one or two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female&#x27;s genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female&#x27;s way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.

Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf weighing about is born. Births usually peak in the dry season, and take place in thickets – unlike the wildebeest, which give birth in groups on the plains. Though calves can move about on their own shortly after birth, they usually lie in the open in close proximity of their mothers. The calf is weaned at four months, but young males stay with their mothers for two and a half years, longer than in other Alcelaphini. Often the mortality rate of male juveniles is high, as they have to face the aggression of territorial adult males and are also deprived of good forage by them. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

==Habitat==
Hartebeest inhabit dry savannas, open plains and wooded grasslands, often moving into more arid places after rainfall. They are more tolerant of wooded areas than other Alcelaphini, and are often found on the edge of woodlands. They have been reported from altitudes on Mount Kenya up to . The red hartebeest is known to move across large areas, and females roam home ranges of over , with male territories in size. Females in the Nairobi National Park (Kenya) have individual home ranges stretching over , which are not particularly associated with any one female group. Average female home ranges are large enough to include 20 to 30 male territories.

==Status and conservation==


Each hartebeest subspecies is listed under a different conservation status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The species as a whole is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, and Tunisia.

* The Bubal hartebeest has been declared extinct since 1994. German explorer Heinrich Barth, in his works of 1857, cites firearms and European intrusion among the reasons for the decrease in its numbers. It was extinct in Tunisia by the late 19th century. The last individual was shot in Missour (Algeria) in 1925.
*Coke&#x27;s hartebeest is listed as Least Concern. This species has been greatly affected by habitat destruction, and about 42,000 Coke&#x27;s hartebeest occur today in Mara, Serengeti National Park, and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania and Tsavo East National Park in Kenya. The population is decreasing, and 70% of the population lives in protected areas.
*The Lelwel hartebeest is listed as Endangered, and numbers have declined greatly since the 1980s, when its population was over 285,000. It was formerly distributed mainly in the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, northern and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Sudan. Fewer than 70,000 individuals are left. Most of the population nowadays is found in Chad in the Salamat region and the Zakouma National Park (Chad), the National Park population benefiting from improved protection and seeing an increase in population since the 1980s; Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park and Bamingui-Bangoran National Park and Biosphere Reserve in the Central African Republic, where the populations have been falling; Rumanyika Orugundu Game Reserve and Ibanda Game Reserve in Tanzania; and Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda.
*Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest is listed as Least Concern, and occurs in protected areas such as the Selous Game Reserve and in the wild in southern and western Tanzania and Zambia.
* The red hartebeest is listed as Least Concern. It is the most widespread, with increasing numbers after its reintroduction into protected and private areas. However, it has been extinct in Lesotho since the twentieth century. Its population is estimated to be over 130,000 (as of 2008), mostly in southern Africa. In Namibia, the largest population occurs in the Etosha National Park. A reintroduced population is flourishing in the Malolotja Nature Reserve (Eswatini), outside its range. However, numbers have seen a sharp fall in southwestern Botswana.
*The Tora hartebeest is listed as Critically Endangered; the IUCN has ascertained that fewer than 250 mature individuals survive as of 2008. It is possibly extinct due to excessive hunting and agricultural expansion, but may still exist in smaller numbers in Eritrea and Ethiopia. There have been unconfirmed reports of sightings by locals of the Tora hartebeest southeast of the Dinder National Park, from where it had disappeared before 1960.
*Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest is listed as Endangered, and is close to being Critically Endangered. The total population in 2008 was less than 600, of which the mature specimens numbered 250. But in 2021, the population has slowly increased from 600 to 1528 individuals. It is confined to four major protected areas: the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary, Nechisar National Park, Awash National Park and Maze National Park. The hartebeest in Senkele have to compete with the livestock of the Oromo people. A study in the Nechisar National Park during 2009 and 2010 found a considerable increase in the livestock of the Oromos (49.9% and 56.5% increase during 2006 and 2010, respectively), illegal resource exploitation, and habitat loss as major threats to the Swayne&#x27;s hartebeest populations there.
*The western hartebeest is listed as Near Threatened. It has been eliminated from most of its range, including the southwestern savannas and Boucle du Baoulé National Park in Mali; southwestern Niger; southern Senegal; Gambia; Ivory Coast; Burkina Faso. Small populations survive in Bafing National Park and the area bounded by Bamako, Bougouni and Sikasso in Mali; Tamou Reserve in Niger; Niokolo-Koba National Park in Senegal; Comoé National Park in Ivory Coast; Diefoula forest and Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso; Pendjari National Park in Benin; and Bouba Njida, Bénoué, and Faro National Parks in Cameroon.

==Relationship with humans==
Hartebeest are popular game and trophy animals as they are prominently visible and hence easy to hunt. Pictorial as well as epigraphic evidence from Egypt suggests that in the Upper Palaeolithic age, Egyptians hunted hartebeest and domesticated them. The hartebeest was a prominent source of meat, but its economic significance was lower than that of gazelles and other desert species. However, from the beginning of the Neolithic age, hunting became less common and consequently the remains of the hartebeest from this period in ancient Egypt, where it is now extinct, are rare.

In a study on the effect of place and sex on carcass characteristics, the average carcass weight of the male red hartebeest was and that of females was . The meat of the animals from Qua-Qua region had the highest lipid content— per of meat. Negligible differences were found in the concentrations of individual fatty acids, amino acids, and minerals. The study considered hartebeest meat to be healthy, as the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids was 0.78, slightly more than the recommended 0.7.

<text>The Eleanor Roosevelt College (Roosevelt or ERC) is one of seven undergraduate colleges at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego). While ERC has students of all majors, the college emphasizes international understanding in its co-curricular programming and general education requirements, requiring students to complete the &quot;Making of the Modern World&quot; history and writing program, a regional specialization, and demonstrate basic proficiency in a foreign language.

==History==
In 1985, a planning committee recommended the creation of a new college at UC San Diego focused on comparative cultural and historical studies to augment its four existing undergraduate colleges and their different general education foci. The Academic Senate approved the proposal in May 1986 and James Lyon was appointed founding provost of Fifth College in March 1987. UCSD&#x27;s colleges receive a numeric designation until a permanent name is later chosen. In fall 1988, Fifth College welcomed its inaugural class. The college was named Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC) in a dedication ceremony in 1995, at which First Lady Hillary Clinton delivered an address. In 2003, ERC moved to its current location in a newly built college complex on the northwestern region of the university campus.

Like all UCSD colleges, ERC is led by a provost, who is a faculty member appointed to oversee the college for a five-year term. The provost is the highest academic officer in the college and oversees its organizational structure, which includes academic advising and student affairs, residence life, an academic program (the Making of the Modern World), and UCSD&#x27;s International House. Currently, ERC&#x27;s Provost is Dr. Ivan Evans.

== Academics, Mission, and the Making of the Modern World Program ==
While ERC students major in all disciplines, the college&#x27;s thematic focus is on international understanding and engagement. Its general education requirements include proficiency in a foreign language, a regional specialization in which students take 1 lower- and 2 upper-division courses related to a specific region of the world, and ERC&#x27;s world history and cultures core sequence called The Making of the Modern World (MMW).

Founded in 1988, MMW is a five-course, lower-division sequence (MMW11 – MMW15) for students entering as freshmen and a two-course, upper-division sequence (MMW121 – MMW122) for transfer students.  MMW is taught by departmental faculty in the Division of Arts and Humanities and the Division of Social Sciences as well as by faculty appointed directly to MMW. MMW is taught every quarter during the academic year and in summer and is offered both on campus and abroad on Global Seminars.  Since 2008, MMW has taught 38 programs abroad (2008–2020) on six continents to more than 800 students.  In 2017-18 the program launched MMW Serves, which combines an MMW course with spring break service experiences, which have been offered on Catalina Island, in National Parks, and on the Navajo Reservation

In addition, MMW provides community engagement and volunteer opportunities for students, including through its program working with San Diego&#x27;s refugee community.

ERC offers First Year Experience courses for incoming first-quarter students. These courses are designed for new students at UC San Diego and provide critical skills and valuable resources to facilitate engagement and foster academic success and personal enrichment.  These are 2-credit courses with one hour of faculty-led lecture and one hour of student-led discussion section each week. These ERC courses are taught by the Making of the Modern World Program faculty and sections are led by undergraduate discussion leaders who have received specialized training. First quarter students can enroll in ERC 1 &quot;Freshman Year Experience,&quot; and transfers can enroll in ERC 2 &quot;Transfer Year Experience.&quot;

Beyond this, ERC offers freshman and senior seminars that address diverse topics, including disability awareness, the global refugee situation, and meditation and well-being.

ERC emphasizes the value of study abroad and one third of ERC students go abroad. In addition, ERC has developed its own international programs, offering summer MMW Global Seminars and ERC Regional Specialization programs abroad as well as spring break service projects, both international and domestic.

ERC is the sponsor of UCSD&#x27;s International Migration Studies and Human Rights minor.

=== Honors ===
First year students who hold exceptional high school GPAs and who received a high score on the SAT/ACT are invited to participate in the ERC First Year Honors Seminar. The Provost teaches the seminar, which students receive one unit of credit for (per quarter).

Second year students with a GPA of 3.5+ and who have completed three of the five courses in the MMW sequence are invited to participate in the ERC Sophomore Honors Project. Students take on a research project with the assistance of a professor. They are awarded two units of independent study credit per quarter.

Students who earn a quarter GPA of 3.5+ whilst taking 12+ graded units receive Provost&#x27;s Honors, which appears on students&#x27; transcripts.

==Facilities and housing==
Eleanor Roosevelt College&#x27;s current location was designed by the architect Moshe Safdie. Safdie designed the buildings within ERC so that they would not interfere with the campus&#x27;s ocean view. It has also been noted that the layout of ERC was designed to bring people together.

The residential facilities are named after global regions and seek to integrate the philosophy of the college into their design. There are five residence halls for freshmen (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America Halls) and six apartment complexes for sophomores (Earth Hall North, Earth Hall South, Middle East, Oceania, Geneva, and Mesa Verde Hall). 
The residence halls are on the western side of the ERC Green. Middle Earth, a common lounge, sits in front of the Earth Hall North and South apartment buildings, which are on the eastern side of the Green. Café Ventanas, ERC&#x27;s dining hall, is on north side of the Green. To the south of the Green is the Student Activity Center, a laundromat, and an Amazon locker. Behind the Student Activity Center is the Pangea Parking Structure.
ERC hosts three Living Learning Communities (LLCs). Living Learning Communities seek to bring together a like-minded group of people who want to live together. The Raza LLC, for Latinx students, is located within one of the residence halls for new students, and I-House for continuing students. The Gender Inclusive LLC is located in the ERC apartments and I-House. Students who participated in the OASIS Summer Bridge program for first-generation college students can opt to live in the OASIS LLC.

=== International House (I-House) ===
ERC also is home to UCSD&#x27;s International House (I-House), whose residents are composed of half international and half domestic students. I-House consists of four apartment buildings: Geneva Hall, Kathmandu House, Cuzco House, and Asante House. I-House also contains the Great Hall, a basketball court, four classrooms, a laundromat, and an activity center.

Faculty and post-graduate visitors can live in fourth-floor furnished apartments inside of I-House. They are called Visiting Scholar Bridge-unit Apartments, as the units act as bridges between the two sides of the apartment building. Visiting Scholar Bridge-unit Apartments are located in the Asante, Kathmandu, and Geneva buildings.

The Great Hall is an event center in ERC, and is used for I-House and ERC events. It can also be rented for private events.

Four classrooms are located in Asante House.

== Student organizations ==
Circuit Research Journal (or ERC Circuit) is an undergraduate research journal that publishes the work of ERC students.

Community Outreach Effort (CORE) does volunteer work in the San Diego community. Members of CORE volunteer at nursing homes, reservations, and children&#x27;s hospitals. CORE also sponsors the BreakAway Global Service (BAGS) trip during spring break, in which ERC students do humanitarian work in another country.

Ellie&#x27;s Garden at ERC (EGERC) cares for the community gardens located in between Asia and Africa halls, and between Europe and Latin America halls.

Planning Activities at Raza LLC (PaRa) represents students living in the Raza LLC. It plans events for those living in the Raza LLC, as well as all Latinx students.

Planning Events at Roosevelt College (PERC) hosts social events for ERC residents. PERC meets Wednesday nights at 6pm in Middle Earth.

Queers &amp; Allies of ERC (QuERC) seeks to bring LGBT people and their allies together, and to raise awareness for LGBT issues.

The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roosevelt Committee (RnR) is in charge of planning the annual event Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roosevelt, a concert held on the ERC Green.

=== International House (I-House) organizations ===
International House of Planning (IHOP) plans events for I-House, and sponsors field trips off-campus.

International Studies Student Association (ISSA) is made up of students majoring/minoring in International Studies. Members can gain help from and make connections with International Studies alumni through the organization. ISSA also has volunteer opportunities for those that are interested in them.

Model United Nations (MUN) prepares students for diplomatic careers by simulating international conflicts. Students can participate on the &quot;logistical team,&quot; planning MUN&#x27;s annual TritonMUN and SanDiMUN conferences. Students can also participate as full members, participating in diplomatic scenarios and getting to travel for conferences.

Prospect Journal of International Affairs is a student-run research journal.

Members of Refugee Connections volunteer in refugee communities and raise awareness for issues affecting refugees. The organization also fundraises in order to support its costs, with its biggest event being the Culture Cap soccer tournament. Students majoring or minoring in Global Health gain field experience through Refugee Connections by helping refugees with their healthcare needs.

Roteract at UCSD is a youth chapter of Rotary International. Roteract makes Water Pasteurization Indicators (WAPIs) to be sent to developing countries, and serves in the local community. The club also meets once per week.

== Events and traditions ==
During the first week of the quarter, ERC hosts/promotes several Welcome Week events, designed to allow new students to become familiar with the campus and make friends. One of these events is the UnOlympics, a competition between the eight UCSD colleges. Students from ERC compete against students from other colleges in athletic events, with one of the colleges winning the Golden Shoe trophy.

On Halloween, Middle Earth, a common area inside of Eleanor Roosevelt College, is turned into a haunted house for students to visit.

During Spirit Week in winter quarter, ERC is decorated in blue and gold, the school colors. At Spirit Night, when the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams play their biggest rivals, students from ERC compete with students from other colleges to cheer the loudest and win the Spirit Night Trophy.

Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roosevelt is a free concert held on the ERC Green during winter quarter. Artists, including Augustana, We the Kings, Saint Motel, Reel Big Fish, Rooney, The Format, Karmin, and Bad Suns have performed at Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roosevelt in the past.

Also during winter quarter, ERC hosts a Casino Night inside of the Great Hall, offering food and raffle prizes along with the games.

During spring break, a group of ERC students travel and participate in a service project in another country. Students apply for the program in the fall, fundraise in the winter, and complete the trip during spring break. This is called BreakAway Global Service, or BAGS, and is sponsored by one of ERC&#x27;s student organizations, Community Outreach Effort (CORE).In the last week of the quarter, Eleanor Roosevelt College hosts the MMW Blowout, a celebration of students&#x27; work in the college&#x27;s general education sequence Making of the Modern World (MMW). The MMW Blowout is set up like a carnival, and features games and free food. One of the games at the MMW Blowout is a dunk tank, with MMW professors and teaching assistants sitting in the tank. The first 500 students to attend the MMW Blowout also receive a free T-shirt.

A Recognition Banquet is hosted at the end of the year to honor student leaders and organizers. ERC also hosts a Senior Brunch, honoring outstanding seniors and celebrating all seniors&#x27; graduation.

Because UCSD runs on a college system, students have the option of attending All-Campus Commencement (which all graduating students can attend), commencement with students from their college, or both. ERC&#x27;s commencement is held at RIMAC Field, usually on the Saturday of finals week.

Every month, Café Ventanas, the dining hall located in ERC, offers food, entertainment, and activities centered around a region of the world in their Global Marketplace event.

Once a year, a blood drive is hosted at the Great Hall by Planning Events at Roosevelt College (PERC), a student-run organization.

The Saturday before finals week at midnight, students from Eleanor Roosevelt College stand outside of their dorms/apartments and scream. This is called the Finals Week Scream, and is practiced by students in all six colleges.

=== International House (I-House) events ===
The International Friday Café takes place in the Great Hall every week. A different type of cuisine is featured every time. Cultural exhibits also take place.

One of the goals of I-House is to get people of different cultures to engage with one another. I-House hosts different types of events throughout the year in order to facilitate this effort: Global Forums, IHeART, Language Conversation Tables, Sunday Supper, and Slice of America are some of them.

Global Forums are hosted every Wednesday evening of the academic year in the Great Hall. Global Forums feature experts in a field speaking about a particular issue, and may include a discussion. I-HeART follows a similar structure to the Global Forum, in which experts speak about an issue to an audience. However, with I-HeART the issue is connected to the arts.

The Language Conversation Tables allow students, staff, and the public to practice conversational language skills with a fluent speaker of a language. The schedule for the Language Conversation Tables changes quarterly, though it usually take place on multiple nights of the week, with different languages being featured on different nights. In order to become a &#x27;host,&#x27; one of the fluent speakers whom attendees of the Language Conversation Tables can speak with, students must apply.

Sunday Supper is held once quarterly during the evening. It includes a meal, talk, and performances that all fall under a particular theme.

Slice of America is a quarterly field trip in which students visit a local community/attend a local event in order to gain a broader understanding of the world.

I-Plus is the umbrella term for events hosted/sponsored by I-House not included among their usual program (Global Forums, IHeART, Language Conversation Tables, Sunday Supper, Slice of America). Examples include International Education Week, which I-House sponsors during the fall quarter; International Women&#x27;s Day, celebrated on March 8; and Compassion Week, an effort by I-House to get students to be more friendly and helpful toward one another.

<text>Suspect Zero is a 2004 psychological thriller film directed by E. Elias Merhige and starring Aaron Eckhart, Ben Kingsley, and Carrie-Anne Moss. The film was produced by Tom Cruise&#x27;s co-owned company Cruise/Wagner Productions. It was a box office bomb, failing to earn half of its estimated $27 million production costs

The film is about the hunt for Suspect Zero, a potential serial killer who is able to kill indefinitely because he is able to remain undetectable by law enforcement agencies. It features various elements from declassified DIA Stargate remote viewing protocols. As of 2025, it is the last theatrical film Merhige has directed.

== Plot ==
Harold Speck was a traveling salesman, making the rounds in a small town when he encountered an old man in a diner. The man approached him with a strange, uncomfortable question, before abruptly leaving. Shortly after his visit, Harold was found dead in the front seat of his car, his eyelids cut off and a strange symbol in his grasp, a circular shape with a line drawn through it. Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent Thomas Mackelway, recently suspended for brutally beating suspected serial killer Raymond Starkey, is brought in to investigate Harold&#x27;s death. He and his partner Fran Kulok soon become the recipients of a series of taunting faxes from someone claiming to be the killer, leading them to discover the existence of Suspect Zero, a mysterious criminal responsible for hundreds of unsolved deaths and leaving no physical evidence behind. With the help of a mysterious informant known only as &quot;Mr. Blue&quot;, Mackelway and Kulok follow the clues left by Suspect Zero in order to find the truth behind Harold Speck&#x27;s tragic and mysterious death.

When another body is found in the trunk of a car, the agents trace the ownership of the car to a room in a halfway house occupied by Benjamin O&#x27;Ryan. Upon further investigation, they discover that the room is decorated with obsessive-compulsive sketches of a crossed-circle symbol, a Bible with sketches of missing persons, and a book on ritual. As Mackelway begins to question the other occupants of the halfway house, one of them informs him that the symbol actually represents a zero, not a circle. The killer also sends the agents mysterious information, prompting Mackelway to focus on O&#x27;Ryan. O&#x27;Ryan claims to be an ex-member of the FBI, but the agents can&#x27;t be sure if O&#x27;Ryan is the key to catching the elusive Suspect Zero, or if he is Suspect Zero himself. With the evidence they have, fiery passion for justice, as well as hope, the agents must make a calculated guess to finally bring down the elusive figure who has eluded authorities for so long.

It is only when Mackelway uses his abilities to uncover the name of Starkey&#x27;s partner in crime, along with evidence proving O&#x27;Ryan&#x27;s innocence, that the case is solved. The evening was warm and still as Mackelway and Kulok drove towards the bar. They had received a call about an attempted kidnapping and were on their way to help the victim. When they arrived, they found O&#x27;Ryan standing outside, the body of a man lying near his feet. To their shock, they recognized him as Starkey, a man that had recently been released from prison. Evidence soon came to light that O&#x27;Ryan was part of Project Icarus, an experimental program aimed at developing and harnessing telepathic abilities in individuals for military purposes. O&#x27;Ryan had used these abilities to understand the actions of serial killers, leading him to hunt them down. It was then that Mackelway discovered that he too had limited access to these abilities.

Kulok and Mackelway&#x27;s superiors were unconvinced by O&#x27;Ryan&#x27;s claims that the man had been the victim of a serial killer rather than the perpetrator. It took Mackelway&#x27;s use of his abilities to uncover the identity of Starkey&#x27;s partner in crime, as well as conclusive evidence that O&#x27;Ryan was indeed innocent, for the case to be solved. Finally, there was justice for the young girl who was almost taken away, with O&#x27;Ryan’s use of his special abilities providing the solution to the case.

Suspect Zero is revealed to be a man who drives cross-country in a refrigerated truck as part of an elaborate scheme to target and kidnap children. It&#x27;s only when FBI agent Mackelway discovers signs of freezer burns on his victims that he knows they were being transported in the truck. Mackelway makes his way to a local carnival in pursuit of the truck driver and is surprised to find the child he had seen in his vision as being &quot;captured&quot; is now free. He is then suddenly approached by O&#x27;Ryan, who captures Mackelway, though spares him after witnessing his bravery. O&#x27;Ryan and Mackelway team up and eventually find out the identity of Suspect Zero and trace him back to his ranch, where they discover numerous shallow graves. In an ensuing chase, both vehicles crash off the road and Kulok manages to rescue a child, while Mackelway kills Suspect Zero. But O&#x27;Ryan attempts to convince Mackelway to put an end to his suffering by killing him. When Mackelway refuses, O&#x27;Ryan pretends to attack, prompting Kulok to shoot him in order to protect her partner.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
The film is based on a first draft by Zak Penn, which allegedly impressed Steven Spielberg so much in its depiction of serial killers&#x27; elongated middle fingers that he went home and checked his children&#x27;s hands. After it was sold to Universal Studios for $750,000, Cruise/Wagner Productions became attached to the film, with Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner producing. However the script was put onto the back burner after a deal to make the movie in 1997 with Sylvester Stallone fell through. Cruise had intended to star in the film initially, but instead opted to star in &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. Universal then courted Ben Affleck to rewrite Penn&#x27;s script, but Affleck would depart the project over creative differences in November 1999. Christian Duguay would sign on to direct the film, while Paul Schrader and Richard Friedenberg were brought in for subsequent script revisions. By August 2001, E. Elias Merhige replaced Duguay as director, with production gearing up to start in fall of that year.

In 2002, Cruise/Wagner Productions hired Bill Ray to rewrite Penn&#x27;s original script. Changes included moving the action from Texas, making the lead character a burned-out, disgraced FBI agent rather than a rookie, and turning a maverick criminal profiler into a psychic with the power of remote viewing.

===Filming===
The film began shooting in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2002. The state was chosen because it offered tax-free incentives and financial funding to film companies using New Mexico. The program was established to entice film makers to the state.

==Reception==

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Suspect Zero&quot; holds an approval rating of 18% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Other than Ben Kingsley, there&#x27;s not much to like in this preposterous thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C–&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert felt that the film was too confusing, stating &quot;enigmatic flashes of incomprehensible action grow annoying, and a point at which we realize that there&#x27;s no use paying close attention, because we won&#x27;t be able to figure out the film&#x27;s secrets until they&#x27;re explained to us.&quot; Nick Schager from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote a particularly scathing review of the film, stating &quot;&quot;Suspect Zero&quot; proves, uninspired imitation is the lowest form of thriller filmmaking.&quot; Carla Meyer from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; was also critical of the film, writing, &quot;&quot;Suspect Zero&quot; needed to be exceptional, and it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s merely adequate, with one riveting element but limited chills.&quot;

<text>Bee Aviation Associates, Inc. (Beecraft) built three prototype aircraft designed by William F. &quot;Bill&quot; Chana at Montgomery Field in San Diego, California. None of the aircraft went into production.

==History==
The first aircraft built was the Wee Bee in 1948. The Wee Bee is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s lightest aircraft, weighing when empty. It had a two-cylinder engine and tricycle landing gear. The pilot flew in a prone position, lying atop the fuselage. The Honey Bee was the second plane, completed in 1952. It had a single seat in an enclosed cabin. The Queen Bee was the last and the largest of the three. It was completed in 1960 and seated four. The Queen Bee and the Honey Bee had V-tails.
==Defunct==
The Queen Bee and the Wee Bee were destroyed in a fire that destroyed the San Diego Aerospace Museum on February 22, 1978. The Honey Bee escaped the fire as it operated out of Montgomery Field at the time, owned by Walt Mooney. In 2004, the Experimental Aircraft Association donated the Honey Bee to the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum, which is currently () awaiting restoration at their Gillespie Field annex. According to Aerofiles, two Honey Bees were built based on advertised plans. Because of its historic significance, a second Wee Bee was constructed and is now on display at the new San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

In 1990, Hi-Tech Expressions (under license from Capcom) produced a DOS game based on the series simply titled &quot;Mega Man&quot;. It was followed by a second DOS game titled &quot;Mega Man III&quot; in 1992. Both games were released exclusively in North America. Despite their titles, neither games are ports of their corresponding NES counterparts, but original games. There was no PC game titled &quot;Mega Man II&quot;. Aside from handing the license to Hi-Tech Expressions, Capcom themselves were not directly involved in the PC games. Both games were programmed and designed by Stephen Rozner.

In 1999, Chinese developer Strawberry Soft created a game very similar to &quot;Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That&#x27;s Paradise&quot; called &quot;Rockman Gold Empire&quot;.

In 2001, the Dreams Comes True corporation released under license from Capcom an original Microsoft Windows game titled Rockman Strategy exclusively for the Taiwanese market. The game features a group of new robots led by Apollo and Luna and named after the western Zodiac as well as a new ally named Fan, with the former being tricked into serving Dr. Wily.

<text>This list of [[eponym]]ous laws provides links to articles on laws, principles, adages, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as Parkinson&#x27;s law. In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with Moore&#x27;s law. There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as Murphy&#x27;s law; or given eponymous names despite the absence of the named person. Named laws range from significant scientific laws such as Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, to humorous examples such as Murphy&#x27;s law.

* Sutton&#x27;s law: &quot;Go where the money is.&quot; Often cited in medical schools to teach new doctors to spend resources where they are most likely to pay off. The law is named after bank robber Willie Sutton, who when asked why he robbed banks, is claimed to have answered &quot;Because that&#x27;s where the money is.&quot;
* Swanson&#x27;s law: solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of solar cell industry manufacturing capacity. The law is named after SunPower Corporation founder Richard Swanson.
* Szemerényi&#x27;s law, in Proto-Indo-European phonology: word-final clusters of vowels (V), resonants (R) and either *&quot;s&quot; or *&quot;h&quot; are simplified by dropping the word-final fricative (*&quot;h&quot; was phonetically itself probably a back fricative), with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel. Named for Hungarian linguist Oswald Szemerényi.

* Taylor&#x27;s law: a power law in ecology showing the relationship between the variance and mean of species population density. Named for Lionel Roy Taylor.
* Teeter&#x27;s law: &quot;The language of the family you know best always turns out to be the most archaic.&quot; A wry observation about the biases of historical linguists, explaining how different investigators can arrive at radically divergent conceptions of the proto-language of a family. Named after the American linguist Karl V. Teeter.
* Tesler&#x27;s law of conservation of complexity states that every software application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Named for Larry Tesler.
* Thirlwall&#x27;s law: under certain conditions, the long run growth of a country can be approximated by the ratio of the growth of exports to the income elasticity of demand for imports.
* Titius–Bode law: &quot;a hypothesis that the bodies in some orbital systems, including the Sun&#x27;s, orbit at semi-major axes in a function of planetary sequence&quot;. Named for Johann Daniel Titius and Johann Elert Bode.
* Tobler&#x27;s first law of geography: &quot;Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.&quot; Coined by Waldo R. Tobler (b. 1930).
* Toms effect, drag reduction in turbulent flow due to the addition of polymer solvents. Named after B. A. Toms.
*Triffin dilemma, conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic and long-term international objectives for countries whose currency serves as a global reserve currency; named for Belgian American economist Robert Triffin
*Twyman&#x27;s law: &quot;Any figure that looks interesting or different is usually wrong&quot;, following the principle that &quot;the more unusual or interesting the data, the more likely they are to have been the result of an error of one kind or another&quot;. A whimsical version of the Sagan standard.
* Van Loon&#x27;s law: &quot;The amount of mechanical development will always be in inverse ratio to the number of slaves that happen to be at a country&#x27;s disposal.&quot; Named for Hendrik Willem van Loon.
* Vegard&#x27;s law, in metallurgy, is an approximate empirical rule which holds that a linear relation exists, at constant temperature, between the crystal lattice parameter of an alloy and the concentrations of the constituent elements. Named for Lars Vegard.
* Verdoorn&#x27;s law, in economics: faster growth in output increases productivity due to increasing returns. Named after Dutch economist Petrus Johannes Verdoorn.
* Verner&#x27;s law, stated by Karl Verner in 1875, describes a historical sound change in the Proto-Germanic language whereby voiceless fricatives *f, *þ, *s and *x, when immediately following an unstressed syllable in the same word, underwent voicing and became respectively *b, *d, *z and *g.
* Vierordt&#x27;s law states that, retrospectively, &quot;short&quot; intervals of time tend to be overestimated, and &quot;long&quot; intervals of time tend to be underestimated. Named after German physician Karl von Vierordt.
* Vopěnka&#x27;s principle, in mathematics, is a large cardinal axiom that states that the set-theoretical universe is so large that in every proper class, some members are similar to others, with this similarity formalized through elementary embeddings. Named after Petr Vopěnka.
* Wagner&#x27;s law predicts that the development of an industrial economy will be accompanied by an increased share of public expenditure in gross national product, and is named after the German economist Adolph Wagner (1835–1917).
* Walras&#x27;s law: budget constraints imply that the values of excess market demands must sum to zero.
* Weber–Fechner law, named after the Germans Ernst Heinrich Weber and Gustav Theodor Fechner, attempts to describe the human perception of various physical stimuli. In most cases, Stevens&#x27;s power law gives a more accurate description.
* Weyl law, in mathematics, describes the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Named for Hermann Weyl.
* The Wiedemann–Franz law, in physics, states that the ratio of the electronic contribution of the thermal conductivity (&quot;κ&quot;) to the electrical conductivity (&quot;σ&quot;) of a metal is proportional to the temperature (&quot;T&quot;). Named for Gustav Wiedemann (1826–1899) and Rudolph Franz (1826–1902).
* Wien&#x27;s displacement law states that the black body radiation curve for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength inversely proportional to the temperature. Named for Wilhelm Wien. (See also Wien approximation.)
* Wiio&#x27;s laws: The fundamental Wiio&#x27;s law states that &quot;Communication usually fails, except by accident&quot;.
* Wike&#x27;s law of low odd primes: &quot;If the number of experimental treatments is a low odd prime number, then the experimental design is unbalanced and partially confounded.&quot;
* Will Rogers phenomenon is when moving an observation from one group to another increases the average of both groups
* Winter&#x27;s law: A sound law operating on Balto-Slavic short vowels. Named after Werner Winter
* Wirth&#x27;s law: Software gets slower more quickly than hardware gets faster.
* Wiswesser&#x27;s rule gives a simple method to determine the energetic sequence of electron shells. See also Aufbau principle.
* Wolff&#x27;s law: Bone adapts to pressure, or a lack of it.
* Woodward–Hoffmann rules, in organic chemistry, predict the stereochemistry of pericyclic reactions based on orbital symmetry.
* &quot;Wright&#x27;s law&quot; also known as Experience curve effects postulates that as production doubles, the cost of production will decline by a constant percentage. Named after aerospace engineer Theodore Paul Wright (no relation to the Wright brothers) who was working for Curtiss-Wright aircraft during explosive growth in the &quot;Golden Age of Aviation&quot;. The law was probably first quantified in the industrial setting sometime in 1936. 
* Yao&#x27;s principle, in computational complexity theory: the expected cost of any randomized algorithm for solving a given problem, on the worst case input for that algorithm, can be no better than the expected cost, for a worst-case random probability distribution on the inputs, of the deterministic algorithm that performs best against that distribution. Named for Andrew Yao.
* Yerkes–Dodson law, an empirical relationship between arousal and performance, originally developed by psychologists Robert M. Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson.
* Zawinski&#x27;s law: Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot expand are replaced by ones which can.
* Zeeman effect: Splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field.
* Zipf&#x27;s law, in linguistics, is the observation that the frequency of use of the &quot;n&quot;th-most-frequently-used word in any natural language is approximately inversely proportional to &quot;n&quot;, or, more simply, that a few words are used very often, but many or most are used rarely. Named after George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950), whose statistical body of research led to the observation. More generally, the term &quot;Zipf&#x27;s law&quot; refers to the probability distributions involved, which is applied by statisticians not only to linguistics but also to fields remote from that. See also Zipf–Mandelbrot law.

<text>The Carina Nebula or Eta Carinae Nebula (catalogued as NGC 3372; also known as the Great Carina Nebula) is a large, complex area of bright and dark nebulosity in the constellation Carina, located in the Carina–Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula is approximately from Earth.

The nebula has within its boundaries the large Carina OB1 association and several related open clusters, including numerous O-type stars and several Wolf–Rayet stars. encompasses the star clusters and . is one of the youngest known star clusters at half a million years old and contains stars like the O2 supergiant . is the home of many extremely luminous stars, such as and the Eta Carinae star system. , , , , and are also considered members of the association. is the oldest and furthest from , indicating sequential and ongoing star formation.

The nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae in our skies. Although it is four times as large as and even brighter than the famous Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is much less well known due to its location in the southern sky. It was discovered by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1752 from the Cape of Good Hope.

The Carina Nebula was selected as one of five cosmic objects observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, as part of the release of its first official science images. A detailed image was made of an early star-forming region of NGC 3324 known as the Cosmic Cliffs.

==Discovery and basic information==
Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered the nebula on 25 January 1752. Its dimensions are 120×120 arcminutes centered on the coordinates of right ascension and declination . In modern times it is calculated to be around from Earth.

==Objects within the Carina Nebula==
===Eta Carinae===
Eta Carinae is a highly luminous hypergiant star. Estimates of its mass range from 100 to 150 times the mass of the Sun, and its luminosity is about four million times that of the Sun.

This object is currently the most massive star that can be studied in great detail, because of its location and size. Several other known stars may be more luminous and more massive, but data on them is far less robust. (Caveat: Since examples such as the Pistol Star have been demoted by improved data, one should be skeptical of most available lists of &quot;most massive stars&quot;. In 2006, Eta Carinae still had the highest &quot;confirmed&quot; luminosity, based on data across a broad range of wavelengths.) Stars with more than 80 times the mass of the Sun produce more than a million times as much light as the Sun. They are quite rare—only a few dozen in a galaxy as big as ours—and they flirt with disaster near the Eddington limit, i.e., the outward pressure of their radiation is almost strong enough to counteract gravity. Stars that are more than 120 solar masses exceed the theoretical Eddington limit, and their gravity is barely strong enough to hold in its radiation and gas, resulting in a possible supernova or hypernova in the near future.

Eta Carinae&#x27;s effects on the nebula can be seen directly. Dark globules and some other less visible objects have tails pointing directly away from the massive star. The entire nebula would have looked very different before the Great Eruption in the 1840s surrounded Eta Carinae with dust, drastically reducing the amount of ultraviolet light it put into the nebula.

===Homunculus Nebula===
Within the large bright nebula is a much smaller feature, immediately surrounding Eta Carinae itself, known as the Homunculus Nebula (from Latin meaning &quot;Little Man&quot;). It is believed to have been ejected in an enormous outburst in 1841 which briefly made Eta Carinae the second-brightest star in the sky.

The Homunculus Nebula is a small H II region, with gas shocked into ionized and excited states. It also absorbs much of the light from the extremely luminous central stellar system and re-radiates it as infrared (IR). It is the brightest object in the sky at mid-IR wavelengths.

The distance to the Homunculus can be derived from its observed angular dimensions and calculated linear size, assuming it is axially symmetric. The most accurate distance obtained using this method is . The largest radius of the bipolar lobes in this model is about 22,000 AU, and the axis is oriented 41° from the line of sight, or 49° relative to the plane of the sky, which means it is seen from Earth slightly more &quot;end on&quot; than &quot;side on&quot;.

===Keyhole Nebula===

The Keyhole, or Keyhole Nebula, is a small dark cloud of cold molecules and dust within the Carina Nebula, containing bright filaments of hot, fluorescing gas, silhouetted against the much brighter background nebula. John Herschel used the term &quot;lemniscate-oval vacuity&quot; when first describing it, and subsequently referred to it simply as the &quot;oval vacuity&quot;. The term lemniscate continued to be used to describe this portion of the nebula until popular astronomy writer Emma Converse described the shape of the nebula as &quot;resembling a keyhole&quot; in an 1873 &quot;Appleton&#x27;s Journal&quot; article. The name Keyhole Nebula then came into common use, sometimes for the Keyhole itself, sometimes to describe the whole of the Carina Nebula (signifying &quot;the nebula that contains the Keyhole&quot;).

The diameter of the Keyhole structure is approximately . Its appearance has changed significantly since it was first observed, possibly due to changes in the ionizing radiation from Eta Carinae. The Keyhole does not have its own NGC designation. It is sometimes erroneously called NGC 3324, but that catalogue designation refers to a reflection and emission nebula just northwest of the Carina Nebula (or to its embedded star cluster).

===Defiant Finger===
A small Bok globule in the Keyhole Nebula (at RA 10h44m30s, Dec −59°40&#x27;) has been photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope and is nicknamed the &quot;Carina Defiant Finger&quot; due to its shape. In Hubble images, light can be seen radiating off the edges of the globule; this is especially visible in the southern tip, where the &quot;finger&quot; is. It is thought that the Defiant Finger is being ionized by the bright Wolf–Rayet star WR 25, and/or Trumpler 16-244, a bright blue supergiant. It has a mass of at least , and stars may be forming within it. Like other interstellar clouds under intense radiation, the Defiant Finger will eventually be completely evaporated; for this cloud the time frame is predicted to be 200,000 to 1,000,000 years.

===Trumpler 14===
Trumpler 14 is an open cluster with a diameter of , located within the inner regions of the Carina Nebula, approximately from Earth. It is one of the main clusters of the stellar association, which is the largest association in the Carina Nebula. About 2,000 stars have been identified in . and the total mass of the cluster is estimated to be .

===Trumpler 15===

Trumpler 15 is a star cluster on the north-east edge of the Carina Nebula. Early studies disagreed about the distance, but astrometric measurements by the &quot;Gaia&quot; mission have confirmed that it is the same distance as the rest of Carina OB1.

===Trumpler 16===

Trumpler 16 is one of the main clusters of the Carina OB1 stellar association, which is the largest association in the Carina Nebula, and it is bigger and more massive than . The star Eta Carinae is part of this cluster.

===Mystic Mountain===
Mystic Mountain is the term for a dust–gas pillar in the Carina Nebula, a photo of which was taken by Hubble Space Telescope on its 20th anniversary. The area was observed by Hubble&#x27;s Wide Field Camera 3 on 1–2 February 2010. The pillar measures in height; nascent stars inside the pillar fire off gas jets that stream from towering “peaks”.

===WR 22===

WR 22 is an eclipsing binary. The dynamical masses derived from orbital fitting vary from over to less than for the primary and about for the secondary. The spectroscopic mass of the primary has been calculated at or .

===WR 25===
WR 25 is a binary system in the central portion of the Carina Nebula, a member of the cluster. The primary is a Wolf–Rayet star, possibly the most luminous star in the galaxy. The secondary is hard to detect but thought to be a luminous OB star.

===HD 93129===

HD 93129 is a triple star system of O-class stars in Carina. All three stars of are among the most luminous in the galaxy; consists of two clearly resolved components, and , and itself is made up of two much closer stars.

HD 93129 A has been resolved into two components. The spectrum is dominated by the brighter component, although the secondary is only 0.9 magnitudes fainter. is an O2 supergiant and Ab is an O3.5 main sequence star. Their separation has decreased from 55 milliarcseconds in 2004 to only 27 mas in 2013, but an accurate orbit is not available.

HD 93129 B is an O3.5 main-sequence star 3 arcseconds away from the closer pair. It is about 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the combined , and is approximately the same brightness as .

===HD 93250===

HD 93250 is one of the brightest stars in the region of the Carina Nebula. It is only 7.5 arcminutes from Eta Carinae, and is considered to be a member of the same loose open cluster , although it appears closer to the more compact .

HD 93250 is known to be a binary star, however, individual spectra of the two components have never been observed but are thought to be very similar. The spectral type of has variously been given as O5, O6/7, O4, and O3. It has sometimes been classified as a main sequence star and sometimes as a giant star. The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey has used it as the standard star for the newly created O4 subgiant spectral type.

===HD 93205===

HD 93205 is a binary system of two large stars.

The more massive member of the pair is an O3.5 main sequence star. The spectrum shows some ionized nitrogen and helium emission lines, indicating some mixing of fusion products to the surface and a strong stellar wind. The mass calculated from apsidal motion of the orbits is . This is somewhat lower than expected from evolutionary modelling of a star with its observed parameters.

The less massive member is an O8 main sequence star of approximately . It moves in its orbit at a speed of over and is considered to be a relativistic binary, which causes the apses of the orbit to change in a predictable way.

<doc id="939581" wikidata="Q1136256" url="?curid=939581" title="Lichtenstein's hartebeest">
<text>Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus lichtensteinii) is a subspecies of the hartebeest antelope that dwells in savannahs and floodplains of Southeastern-Central Africa. It is sometimes classified as a unique species, &quot;Sigmoceros lichtensteinii&quot;.

It derives its name from zoologist Martin Lichtenstein.

==Description==
It typically stands about at the shoulder and have a mass of around . It has a red-brown colour, which is lighter on the underbelly. The horns found on both sexes appear from the side to be shaped like the letter &#x27;S&#x27;, and appear from the front to be shaped like the letter &#x27;O&#x27; with its upper portions missing. The horns are slightly ridged and reach over in length.

==Behavior==
They live on areas where they eat grasses. They are diurnal (active in the day). They gather in herds of five to 15 females and calves with a single male, which leads them. The male stands sentry duty on termite mounds and the like. Males hold large territories, which they mark by digging up soil with their horns around the borders. Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest have good eyesight but a poor sense of smell. Their main sounds are a bellow and a sneeze-snort sound.

They travel in herds. Herds are mainly kept between 1-10 individuals (89% of all LH in Tanzania have been within 1-10 animals. The herd may be composed of more than 10 individuals but it is seldom. (Booth 1985). It is noted that the highest number of Lichtenstein&#x27;s Hartebeest congregating together occur in August/September. The exact reason is unknown however this is primarily when most calves are born. Add in local migration from other herds and it may a form of anti predator grouping to protect newborn calves. However, Bachelor males are often found alone countering the herd mentality (Dowsett 1966; Wilson 1966; Rodgers 1977). Bachelor bulls do not establish territories while solitary bulls will exclude others from their domain (Dowsett 1966). The ratio of male to female LH is 1:2.37.

Lichtenstein&#x27;s Hartebeest are very territorial mammals and there is no overlap in territories between bulls. The rutting period (breeding season) runs typically from mid October to January, although slight variations exist between different locations (Dowsett 1966). Bachelor bulls will often challenge alpha bulls until the point of complete exhaustion to take over the related female LHs. There are numerous stereotyped behaviour patterns in the repertoire of the genus Alcephalus that are directly associated with territorial defence (von Richter 1972). Amongst these, pawing and horning the earth are the most conspicuous. In Zimbabwe the most conspicuous body movements were the &quot;head-to-flank&quot;, in which the head is rubbed against the shoulder, and a &quot;head-flagging&quot; movement in which the hartebeest shook its head up and down vigorously when alarmed. Hartebeests mark their territory by forming dung piles in their respective territories.

<doc id="939582" wikidata="Q4950655" url="?curid=939582" title="Bow Road railway station">
<text>Bow Road is a closed railway station in Bow, East London, that was opened in 1876 on the Bow Curve branch line by the Great Eastern Railway (GER).

The station building was situated slightly west of a former North London Railway (NLR) station called and near the current Underground station and DLR station. Bow Road station was re-sited in 1892 to a site down-line from . It was closed in 1949.

==Original station on the site==
The line that the station was located on, called the Bow curve, was opened by the London and Blackwall Extension Railway (LBER) on 2 April 1849. This line served the first station on the site, named Bow and Bromley and located south of Bow Road itself, on a viaduct. Trains would, if there was a connecting service, run on to an interchange station called , otherwise services terminated at Bow and Bromley. The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) was not particularly co-operative in stopping many of their services at Victoria Park and Bow, and in the March 1850 Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide the only ECR services to call at Victoria Park and Bow were the 6:07 a.m. to on weekdays and the 1:37 p.m. to Norwich on Sundays. In the London-bound direction there were no weekday services at all, and just two services called on Sundays at 1:05 and 9:28 p.m.

The original intention had been to build a junction with the ECR main line between and Stratford stations and run through-trains from .

The relationship between the two railway companies was poor at this time so the junction was not built and services on the newly opened branch lasted until 26 September 1850 when the original station was closed. The relationship gradually improved and in 1854 the junction between the two lines was built and the LBER became part of the initial London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) route to Fenchurch Street (with the more direct route from opening in 1858).

By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed by amalgamation.

==First Bow Road station==
The London and Blackwall Railway (LBR) was leased four years later in 1866 and some 10 years later on 1 October 1876 the GER built a new station south of Bow Road, which was named Bow Road and stood on the original site of Bromley and Bow station, but the new station had wooden platforms that had to be cantilevered off the viaduct. There was a small booking office at street-level with stairs leading up to the platform each side of the viaduct.

On 3 September 1881 there was a collision at Bow Road when a train ran into the back of a stationary train which had failed at the station. The driver and fireman of the moving train were killed and 11 passengers were injured. In the inquiry that followed the cause was deemed to be the failure of the signalman to protect the rear of the train by setting signals to &quot;danger&quot;. The train crew were criticised in that while they had noticed the signals were not at &quot;danger&quot;, they had failed to inform the signalman. The guard of the first train was also criticised for not having properly protected the rear of the failed train.

In the late 1880s a small goods yard was opened south of Bow Road passenger station. It handled domestic coal, bricks, building materials and general merchandise and was equipped (in GER days) with a five-ton capacity crane, seven-ton cart weighbridge and a small goods lock-up. The yard was closed in 1964 and the Bow Triangle Business Centre now occupies the site.

In 1892 Bow Road passenger station was re-sited to the north and an interchange walkway provided with the neighbouring NLR&#x27;s Bow station. After closure, the first station building was used as a coal office, later an auctioneer, then in 1912 was converted to a cinema.

==Second Bow Road station==

The re-sited Bow Road station commenced operations on 4 April 1892. The re-locating of this station then allowed the GER to withdraw a Bow to Fenchurch Street service it was running from the adjoining NLR&#x27;s Bow station (which they had taken over from the NLR in 1869). Essentially the GER had been operating two services from Bow to Fenchurch Street since 1876 which given the increasingly busy nature of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (as well as freight) was almost certainly a move to relieve congestion as well as save costs.

The walkway between Bow Road and Bow stations was closed in 1917 as a wartime economy measure, a mere 25 years after Bow Road had been re-sited.

In the July 1922 edition of Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide, trains serving Bow Road could be found on page 318. On weekdays the first country-bound train from Fenchurch Street ran at 6:20 a.m. with the last at 9:53 p.m. The journey time was around 12 minutes (assuming trains stopped at all intermediate stations, although some did not). Journey time to Stratford was then a further six minutes. Most trains went as far as Ilford. In the opposite direction the first train to Fenchurch Street departed Bow Road at 5:49 a.m. and the last at 9:30 p.m.

The new station was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) after the 1923 grouping. On 21 April 1941 the station was closed due to bomb damage as a result of German bombing raids during the Blitz.

Bow Road re-opened on 9 December 1946 but then closed between 6 January 1947 and 6 October 1947 so a number of alterations could be made. The line was electrified at this point and the original intention was to run shuttle services between Stratford and Fenchurch Street.

Following nationalisation of the railways in 1948, Bow Road became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways. It was then decided to withdraw passenger services from the line and Bow Road station was permanently closed on 7 November 1949. The line was retained for diversions.

==The line today==
The line Bow Road station stood on, between Gas Factory Junction on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) and Bow Junction on the Great Eastern Main Line (GEML), was reduced to a single track circa 1986 to allow the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Poplar-Stratford branch to share the alignment north of the station. the line is not in use in the regular timetable.

It is almost certain that the station will never re-open given the proximity of Bow Church DLR and Bow Road tube stations. A study of aerial photographs shows the platforms and stairwell structures intact on the viaduct, and the station building is still in commercial use on Bow Road. The 1876 station site appears to have been re-developed.

<doc id="939583" wikidata="Q15897" url="?curid=939583" title="Amy Winehouse">
<text>Amy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 – 23 July 2011) was an English singer, songwriter, and musician. With over 30 million records sold worldwide, she is known for her deep, expressive contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul, rhythm and blues, reggae, and jazz.

Winehouse was a member of the National Youth Jazz Orchestra in her youth, signing to Simon Fuller&#x27;s 19 Management in 2002 and soon recording a number of songs before signing a publishing deal with EMI. She also formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers. Winehouse&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Frank&quot;, was released in 2003. Many of the album&#x27;s songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, were co-written by Winehouse. &quot;Frank&quot; was a critical and commercial success in the UK, and beyond, and was nominated for the UK&#x27;s Mercury Prize. The song &quot;Stronger Than Me&quot; won her the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

Winehouse released her follow-up album, &quot;Back to Black&quot;, in 2006. The album went on to become a huge international success and one of the best-selling albums of all time, as well as one of the best-selling albums in UK history. At the 2007 Brit Awards, it was nominated for British Album of the Year and Winehouse received the award for British Female Solo Artist. The song &quot;Rehab&quot; won her a second Ivor Novello Award. At the 50th Grammy Awards in 2008, she won five awards, tying the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night and becoming the first British woman to win five Grammys. These included three of the General Field &quot;Big Four&quot; Grammy Awards: Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year (for &quot;Rehab&quot;), as well as Best Pop Vocal Album.

Winehouse struggled throughout her life with substance abuse, mental illness and addiction. She died at her Camden Square home in London of alcohol poisoning in 2011 at the age of 27, prompting media references to the 27 Club. Her brother believed that bulimia was also a factor. After her death, &quot;Back to Black&quot; briefly became the UK&#x27;s best-selling album of the 21st century. VH1 ranked Winehouse 26th on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Women in Music&quot;. Her life and career was dramatised in a 2024 biopic, &quot;Back to Black&quot;, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson.

==Early life==
Amy Jade Winehouse was born on 14 September 1983 at Chase Farm Hospital in Gordon Hill in Enfield, London, to Jewish parents. Her father, Mitchell &quot;Mitch&quot; Winehouse, was a window panel installer and taxi driver; her mother, Janis Winehouse (née Seaton), was a pharmacist. Her mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2003. Winehouse&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Harris Winehouse emigrated from Minsk, Belarus, to London in 1891. She had an older brother, Alex (born 1979). The family lived in London&#x27;s Southgate area, where she attended Osidge Primary School and then secondary at Ashmole School. Winehouse attended a Jewish Sunday school while she was a child. During an interview following her rise to fame, she expressed her disapproval towards the school by saying that she used to beg her father to permit her not to go and that she learned nothing about being Jewish by going anyway. In the same interview, Winehouse said she only went to a synagogue once a year on Yom Kippur &quot;out of respect&quot;.

Many of Winehouse&#x27;s maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians. Amy&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Cynthia, had been a singer and had dated the English jazz saxophonist Ronnie Scott. She and Amy&#x27;s parents influenced Amy&#x27;s interest in jazz. Her father, Mitch, often sang Frank Sinatra songs to her, and whenever she was chastised at school, she would sing &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; before going up to the headmistress to be told off. Winehouse&#x27;s parents separated when she was nine, and she lived with her mother in Whetstone, London and stayed with her father and his girlfriend in Hatfield Heath, Essex on weekends.

In 1992, her grandmother Cynthia suggested that Amy attend the Susi Earnshaw Theatre School, where she went on Saturdays to further her vocal education and to learn to tap dance. She attended the school for four years and founded a short-lived rap group called Sweet &#x27;n&#x27; Sour, with Juliette Ashby, her childhood friend, before seeking full-time training at Sylvia Young Theatre School. Several years later it was reported that Winehouse had been expelled at 14 for &quot;not applying herself&quot; and also for piercing her nose, however these claims were denied by Sylvia Young: &quot;She changed schools at 15 ... I&#x27;ve heard it said she was expelled; she wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d never have expelled Amy.&quot; Mitch Winehouse also denied the claims. An English teacher at the Sylvia Young Theatre School remembered Amy as a gifted writer, predicting that she would become a novelist or journalist. She attended the Mount School, Mill Hill and the BRIT School in Selhurst, Croydon, dropping out at age 16.

After toying around with her brother Alex&#x27;s guitar, Winehouse bought her own guitar when she was 14 and began writing music shortly afterwards. Soon after, she began working for a living as an entertainment journalist for the World Entertainment News Network and also singing with local group the Bolsha Band. In July 2000, she became the featured female vocalist with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. At home she learned from and practised singing songs by Frank Sinatra, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan and Minnie Ripperton—singers who she said &quot;will get under the song&quot; and remake it as their own rather than sing it straight as written. Winehouse&#x27;s best friend, soul singer Tyler James, sent her demo tape to an A&amp;R person.

==Career==

===2002–2005: Career beginnings and &quot;Frank&quot;===

Winehouse was signed to Simon Fuller&#x27;s 19 Management in 2002 and was initially paid £250 a week against future earnings. While being developed by the management company, Winehouse was kept as a recording industry secret, although she was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club. Her future A&amp;R representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by chance when the manager of the Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured Winehouse as key vocalist. When he asked who the singer was, the manager told him he was not allowed to say. Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was. However, by that time Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs, signed a publishing deal with EMI, and formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi.

Beese introduced Winehouse to his boss, Island head Nick Gatfield, who shared his enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island while rival interest in her had started to build with representatives of EMI and Virgin Records starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the excitement over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, whose audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.

Winehouse&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Frank&quot;, was released on 20 October 2003. Produced mainly by Salaam Remi, many of the songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, Winehouse co-wrote every song. The album received wide critical acclaim with compliments given to the &quot;cool, critical gaze&quot; in its lyrics. Winehouse&#x27;s voice was compared with those of Sarah Vaughan and Macy Gray, among others.

The album entered the upper reaches of the UK Albums Chart in 2004 when it was nominated for the Brit Awards in the categories of British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act. It went on to achieve platinum sales. Later in 2004, she and Remi won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song, for their first single together, &quot;Stronger Than Me&quot;. The album was also shortlisted for the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. In the same year, she performed at the Glastonbury Festival (on the Jazz World stage), the V Festival and the Montreal International Jazz Festival. After the release of the album, Winehouse commented that she was &quot;only 80 percent behind [the] album&quot; because Island Records had overruled her preferences for the songs and mixes to be included. The further singles from the album were &quot;Take the Box&quot;, &quot;In My Bed&quot;/&quot;You Sent Me Flying&quot; and &quot;Pumps&quot;/&quot;Help Yourself&quot;.

===2006–2008: &quot;Back to Black&quot; and international success===

After the release of her first jazz-influenced album, Winehouse&#x27;s focus shifted to the girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones&#x27;s longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up in the studio and on tour. Mitch Winehouse relates in &quot;Amy, My Daughter&quot; how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music. In May 2006, Winehouse&#x27;s demo tracks such as &quot;You Know I&#x27;m No Good&quot; and &quot;Rehab&quot; appeared on Mark Ronson&#x27;s New York City radio show on East Village Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of &quot;Pumps&quot; and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work. She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard.

Promotion of &quot;Back to Black&quot; soon began and, in early October 2006 Winehouse&#x27;s official website was relaunched with a new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs. &quot;Back to Black&quot; was released in the UK on 30 October 2006. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks in February. In the US, it entered at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007, selling 1.85million copies over the course of the year. The first single released from the album was the Ronson-produced &quot;Rehab&quot;. The song reached the top ten in the UK and the US. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Rehab&quot; the Best Song of 2007. Writer Josh Tyrangiel praised Winehouse for her confidence, saying, &quot;What she is is mouthy, funny, sultry, and quite possibly crazy&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s impossible not to be seduced by her originality. Combine it with production by Mark Ronson that references four decades worth of soul music without once ripping it off, and you&#x27;ve got the best song of 2007.&quot; The album&#x27;s second single and lead single in the US, &quot;You Know I&#x27;m No Good&quot;, was released in January 2007 with a remix featuring rap vocals by Ghostface Killah. It ultimately reached number 18 on the UK singles chart. The title track, &quot;Back to Black&quot;, was released in the UK in April 2007 and peaked at number 25, but was more successful across mainland Europe. &quot;Tears Dry on Their Own&quot; and &quot;Love Is a Losing Game&quot; were also released as singles, but failed to achieve the same level of success.
A deluxe edition of &quot;Back to Black&quot; was also released on 5 November 2007 in the UK. The bonus disc features B-sides, rare, and live tracks, as well as &quot;Valerie&quot;. Winehouse&#x27;s debut DVD &quot;I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London&quot; was released the same day in the UK and 13 November in the US. It includes a live set recorded at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire and a 50-minute documentary charting the singer&#x27;s career over the previous four years. &quot;Frank&quot; was released in the United States on 20 November 2007 to positive reviews. The album debuted at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In addition to her own album, she collaborated with other artists on singles. Winehouse was a vocalist on the song &quot;Valerie&quot; on Ronson&#x27;s solo album &quot;Version&quot;. The song peaked at number two in the UK, upon its October single release. &quot;Valerie&quot; was nominated for a 2008 Brit Award for British Single of the Year. Her work with ex-Sugababe Mutya Buena, &quot;B Boy Baby&quot;, was released on 17 December 2007. It served as the fourth single from Buena&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Real Girl&quot;. Winehouse was also in talks of working with Missy Elliott for her album &quot;Block Party&quot;.

Winehouse promoted the release of &quot;Back to Black&quot; with headline performances in late 2006, including a Little Noise Sessions charity concert at the Union Chapel in Islington, London. On 31 December 2006, Winehouse appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s Annual Hootenanny and performed a cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; along with Paul Weller and Holland&#x27;s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. She also performed Toots and the Maytals&#x27; &quot;Monkey Man&quot;. At his request, actor Bruce Willis introduced Winehouse before her performance of &quot;Rehab&quot; at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards in Universal City, California, on 3 June 2007. During the summer of 2007, she performed at various festivals, including Glastonbury Festival and Lollapalooza in Chicago.

The rest of her tour, however, did not go as well. In November 2007, the opening night of a 17-date tour was marred by booing and walkouts at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. A critic for the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; said it was &quot;one of the saddest nights of my life ... I saw a supremely talented artist reduced to tears, stumbling around the stage and, unforgivably, swearing at the audience.&quot; Other concerts ended similarly, with, for example, fans at her Hammersmith Apollo performance in London saying that she &quot;looked highly intoxicated throughout,&quot; until she announced on 27 November 2007, that her performances and public appearances were cancelled for the remainder of the year, citing her doctor&#x27;s advice to take a complete rest. A statement issued by concert promoter Live Nation blamed &quot;the rigours involved in touring and the intense emotional strain that Amy has been under in recent weeks&quot; for the decision. Mitch Winehouse wrote about her nervousness before public performances in his 2012 book, &quot;Amy, My Daughter.&quot; On 13 January 2008, &quot;Back to Black&quot; held the number-one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pan European charts for the third consecutive week.
On 10 February 2008, Winehouse received five Grammy Awards, winning in the following categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Rehab&quot;, and Best Pop Vocal Album. The singer also earned a Grammy as Best New Artist, earning her an entry in the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of Records for Most Grammy Awards won by a British Female Act. Additionally, &quot;Back to Black&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year. Ronson&#x27;s work with her won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, in the non-classical category. She ended her acceptance speech for Record of the Year with, &quot;This is for London because Camden Town ain&#x27;t burning down,&quot; in reference to the 2008 Camden Market fire. Performing &quot;You Know I&#x27;m No Good&quot; and &quot;Rehab&quot; via satellite from London&#x27;s Riverside Studios at 3 a.m. UK time, she couldn&#x27;t be at the ceremony in Los Angeles as her visa approval had not been processed in time.

After the Grammys, the album&#x27;s sales increased, catapulting &quot;Back to Black&quot; to number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, after it initially peaked in the seventh position. On 20 February 2008, Winehouse performed at the 2008 Brit Awards at Earls Court in London, performing &quot;Valerie&quot; with Mark Ronson, followed by &quot;Love Is a Losing Game&quot;. She urged the crowd to &quot;make some noise for my Blake.&quot; A special deluxe edition of &quot;Back to Black&quot; topped the UK album charts on 2 March 2008. Meanwhile, the original edition of the album was ranked at number 30 in its 68th week on the charts, while &quot;Frank&quot; charted at number 35.

In Paris, she performed what was described as a &quot;well-executed 40-minute&quot; set at the opening of a Fendi boutique in early March. By 12 March, the album had sold a total of 2,467,575 copies—318,350 copies had been sold in the previous 10 weeks—putting the album on the UK&#x27;s top-10 best-selling albums of the 21st century for the first time. On 7 April, &quot;Back to Black&quot; was in the top position of the pan-European charts for the sixth consecutive and thirteenth aggregate week. &quot;Amy Winehouse – The Girl Done Good: A Documentary Review&quot;, a 78-minute DVD, was released on 14 April 2008. The documentary features interviews with those who knew her at a young age, people who helped her achieve success, jazz music experts, and music and pop culture specialists.

At the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards in May, Winehouse became the first-ever artist to receive two nominations for the top award: Best Song Musically &amp; Lyrically. She won the award for &quot;Love Is a Losing Game&quot; and was nominated for &quot;You Know I&#x27;m No Good&quot;. &quot;Rehab&quot;, a Novello winner for best contemporary song in 2006, also received a 2008 nomination for best-selling British song. Winehouse was also nominated for a 2008 MTV Europe Music Award in the Act of the Year category.

Although her father, manager and various members of her touring team reportedly tried to dissuade her, Winehouse performed at the Rock in Rio Lisboa festival in Portugal in May 2008. Although the set was plagued by a late arrival and problems with her voice, the crowd warmed to her. In addition to her own material she performed two Specials covers. Winehouse performed at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 90th Birthday Party concert at London&#x27;s Hyde Park on 27 June 2008, and the next day at the Glastonbury Festival. On 12 July, at the Oxegen Festival in Ireland she performed a well-received 50-minute set which was followed the next day by a 14-song set at T in the Park.

On 16 August she played at the Staffordshire leg of the V Festival, and the following day played the Chelmsford leg of the festival. Organisers said that Winehouse attracted the biggest crowds of the festival. Audience reaction was reported as mixed. On 6 September, Winehouse was Bestival&#x27;s Saturday headliner, where she started 40 minutes late and was on stage for 35 minutes, before her performance was terminated because of a curfew.

A clip of Winehouse&#x27;s music was included in the &quot;Roots and Influences&quot; area that looked at connections between different artists at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex NYC, which opened in December 2008. One thread started with Billie Holiday, continued with Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige, and then finished with Winehouse.

&quot;Back to Black&quot; was the world&#x27;s seventh-biggest-selling album of 2008. The album&#x27;s sales meant that the market performance of Universal Music Group&#x27;s recorded music division did not drop to levels experienced by the overall music market. The album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.

===2009–2011: Final projects before death===
In a 2009 poll of U.S. residents conducted for VisitBritain by Harris Interactive, one-fifth of the participants indicated they had listened to Winehouse&#x27;s music during the previous year. She performed with Rhythms del Mundo on their cover of the Sam Cooke song &quot;Cupid&quot; for an &quot;Artists Project Earth&quot; benefit album released in July that year.
Winehouse and Ronson contributed a cover of Lesley Gore&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; to the Quincy Jones tribute album &quot;Q Soul Bossa Nostra&quot;, released in November 2010. She had agreed to form a group with Questlove of the Roots, but her problems obtaining a visa delayed their working together. Salaam Remi had already created some material with Winehouse as part of the project. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Universal Music pressed her for new material in 2008, but as of 2 September that year she had not been near a recording studio. In late October, Winehouse&#x27;s spokesman was quoted as saying that Winehouse had not been given a deadline to complete her third album, for which she was learning to play drums.

In May 2009, Winehouse returned to performing at a jazz festival in Saint Lucia amid torrential downpours and technical difficulties. During her set, it was reported she was unsteady on her feet and had trouble remembering lyrics. She apologised to the crowd for being &quot;bored&quot; and ended the set in the middle of a song. During her stay in Saint Lucia, however, she worked on new music with Remi. On 23 August that year, Winehouse sang with the Specials at the V Festival on their songs &quot;You&#x27;re Wondering Now&quot; and &quot;Ghost Town&quot;.

Island claimed that a new album would be due for release in 2010. Island co-president Darcus Beese said, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard a couple of song demos that have absolutely floored me.&quot; In July 2010, Winehouse was quoted as saying her next album would be released no later than January 2011, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s going to be very much the same as my second album, where there&#x27;s a lot of jukebox stuff and songs that are... just jukebox, really.&quot; Ronson, however, said at that time that he had not started to record the album. She performed &quot;Valerie&quot; with Ronson at a movie premiere but forgot some of the song&#x27;s lyrics. In October, Winehouse performed a four-song set to promote her fashion line. In December 2010, she played a 40-minute concert at a Russian oligarch&#x27;s party in Moscow, with the tycoon hand-selecting the songs.
In January 2011, Winehouse played five dates in Brazil, with opening acts of Janelle Monáe and Mayer Hawthorne. While performing in Florianópolis, Winehouse forgot the lyrics of her songs several times and had to be aided by the public and her band. During the concert, she only drank from a water bottle, but even so, on two occasions, she left the stage in the midst of the show for a period of about five minutes. Upon her return, the crowd showed strong compassion for her and praised Winehouse for continuing the performance. The following month she cut a performance in Dubai short following booing from the audience. Winehouse was reported to be tired, distracted and &quot;tipsy&quot; during the performance.

On 18 June 2011, Winehouse started her 12-leg European tour in Belgrade. Local media described her performance as a scandal and disaster; she was booed off the stage due to her apparently being too drunk to perform. Serbian defence minister Dragan Šutanovac called Winehouse&#x27;s performances &quot;a huge shame and a disappointment&quot;. It was reported that she was unable to remember the city she was in, the lyrics of her songs or the names of the members of her band. The local press also claimed that Winehouse was forced to perform by her bodyguards, who did not allow her to leave the stage when she tried to do so. She then pulled out of performances in Istanbul and Athens, which had been scheduled for the following week. On 21 June, it was announced that she had cancelled all shows of her tour and would be given &quot;as long as it takes&quot; to sort herself out.

Winehouse&#x27;s last public appearance took place at Camden&#x27;s Roundhouse on 20 July 2011, when she made a surprise appearance on stage to support her goddaughter Dionne Bromfield, who was singing &quot;Mama Said&quot; with the Wanted. Winehouse died three days later. Her last recording was a duet with American singer Tony Bennett for his album &quot;Duets II&quot;, released on 20 September 2011. Their single from the album, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, was released on 14 September 2011 on MTV and VH1 to commemorate what would have been her 28th birthday.

==Other ventures==
===Activism and philanthropy===
Throughout her life Winehouse donated her money, music and time to numerous charities and causes, particularly those concerned with children. She joined a campaign to stop a block of flats being built beside the George Tavern, a famous London East End music venue. Campaign supporters feared the residential development would end the spot&#x27;s lucrative sideline as a film and photo location, on which it relies to survive. As part of a breast cancer awareness campaign, Winehouse appeared in a revealing photograph for the April 2008 issue of &quot;Easy Living&quot; magazine. In 2009, she appeared on a CD called &quot;Classics&quot; alongside musicians such as the Rolling Stones, the Killers and many Cuban musicians to raise awareness of climate change.

Winehouse loaned a vintage dress used in her video for &quot;Tears Dry on Their Own&quot; as well as a DVD to the British Music Experience, a new museum dedicated to the history of British pop music. The museum, located at the O2 Arena in London, opened on 9 March 2009. In March 2011, Winehouse donated over £20,000 worth of clothes to a local charity shop in London.

A Caribbean man, Julian Jean DeBaptiste, revealed that Winehouse had paid for his urgent surgery costing £4,000 during her stay in Saint Lucia in 2009. &quot;I had surgery on 1 July 2009... it cost a fortune and Amy paid for the whole thing. I tried to thank her but she just hugged me and told me not to say anything. Her generosity gave me my life back.&quot;

=== Business ===
Winehouse had an estimated £10m fortune, tying her for tenth place in the 2008 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; listing of the wealth of musicians under age 30. The following year her fortune had dropped to an estimated £5m. Her finances are run by Mitch and Janis Winehouse. It was reported she earned about £1m singing at two private parties during Paris Fashion Week as well as another £1m to perform at a Moscow Art Gallery for Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.

In January 2009, Winehouse announced that she was launching her own record label. The first act on her Lioness Records is Winehouse&#x27;s 13-year-old goddaughter Dionne Bromfield. Her first album, featuring covers of classic soul records, was released on 12 October 2009. Winehouse is the backing singer on several tracks on the album and she performed backing vocals for Bromfield on the BBC&#x27;s television programme &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; on 10 October.

Winehouse and her family are the subject of a 2009 documentary shot by Daphne Barak titled &quot;Saving Amy&quot;. Winehouse entered into a joint venture in 2009 with EMI to launch a range of wrapping paper and gift cards containing song lyrics from her album &quot;Back to Black&quot;. On 8 January 2010, a television documentary, &quot;My Daughter Amy&quot;, aired on Channel 4. &quot;Saving Amy&quot; was released as a paperback book in January 2010.

Winehouse was a notable fan of the brand Fred Perry. She collaborated on a 17-piece fashion collection with the label, which was released for sale in October 2010. According to Fred Perry&#x27;s marketing director &quot;We had three major design meetings where she was closely involved in product style selection and the application of fabric, colour and styling details,&quot; and gave &quot;crucial input on proportion, colour and fit&quot;. The collection consists of &quot;vintage-inspired looks including Capri pants, a bowling dress, a trench coat, pencil skirts, a longline argyle sweater and a pink-and-black checkerboard-printed collared shirt.&quot; At the behest of her family, three forthcoming collections up to and including autumn/winter 2012 that she had designed prior to her death were released. Following Winehouse&#x27;s death, Fred Perry has donated 20% of the net revenue from the Amy Winehouse collection to the charity set up in Winehouse&#x27;s name, the Amy Winehouse Foundation.

==Media image==

Winehouse&#x27;s greatest love was 1960s girl groups. Her hairdresser, Alex Foden, borrowed her distinctive beehive hairdo (a weave) from the Ronettes and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from the same group. Her imitation was so successful, as &quot;The Village Voice&quot; reports: &quot;Ronnie Spector—who, it could be argued, all but invented Winehouse&#x27;s style in the first place when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the &quot;New York Post&quot; that she exclaimed, &quot;I don&#x27;t know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s me!&#x27; But then I found out, no, it&#x27;s Amy! I didn&#x27;t have on my glasses.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; style reporter, Guy Trebay, discussed the multiplicity of influences on Winehouse&#x27;s style after her death. Trebay noted, &quot;her stylish husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, may have influenced her look.&quot; Additionally, Trebay observed:
Former &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Joe Levy, who had put her on the magazine&#x27;s cover, broke her look down this way:
Winehouse&#x27;s use of bold red lipstick, thick eyebrows and heavy eyeliner came from Latinas she saw in Miami, on her trip there to work with Salaam Remi on &quot;Back to Black.&quot; Her look was repeatedly denigrated by the British press. At the same time that the NME Awards nominated Winehouse in the categories of &quot;Best Solo Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Music DVD&quot; in 2008, they awarded her &quot;Worst Dressed Performer&quot;. Winehouse was also ranked number two on Richard Blackwell&#x27;s 48th annual &quot;Ten Worst Dressed Women&quot; list, behind Victoria Beckham.

===Controversies===
Winehouse&#x27;s dichotomous public image of critical and commercial success versus personal turmoil prompted significant media comment. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; called Winehouse &quot;a filthy-mouthed, down-to-earth diva&quot;, while &quot;Newsweek&quot; called her &quot;a perfect storm of sex kitten, raw talent and poor impulse control&quot;. Karen Heller with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; summarised the maelstrom this way:

By 2008, her drug problems threatened her career. As Nick Gatfield, the president of Island Records, toyed with the idea of releasing Winehouse &quot;to deal with her problems&quot;, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s a reflection of her status [in the US] that when you flick through the TV coverage [of the Grammys] it&#x27;s her image they use.&quot; Post-Grammys, some questioned whether Winehouse should have been honoured with the awards given her recent personal and drug problems, including Natalie Cole, who introduced Winehouse at the ceremony and who herself battled substance-abuse problems while winning a Grammy for Best New Artist in 1975.

Winehouse was prevented from travelling to and performing at the Grammy Awards ceremony in the US due to failing a drug test, and the executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa, said that the alleged drug habits of Winehouse and other celebrities sent a bad message &quot;to others who are vulnerable to addiction&quot; and undermine the efforts of other celebrities trying to raise awareness of problems in Africa, now that more cocaine used in Europe passes through that continent. Winehouse&#x27;s spokesperson noted that &quot;Amy has never given a quote about drugs or flaunted it in any way. She&#x27;s had some problems and is trying to get better. The U.N. should get its own house in order.&quot;

In January 2008, her record label stated it believed the extensive media coverage she had received increased record sales. In an April 2008 poll conducted by Sky News, Winehouse was named the second-greatest &quot;ultimate heroine&quot; by the UK population at large, topping the voting for that category of those polled under 25 years old. Psychologist Donna Dawson commented that the results demonstrated that women like Winehouse who had &quot;a certain sense of vulnerability or have had to fight against some adversity in their lives&quot; received recognition.

In July 2008, BBC Radio Scotland&#x27;s head, Jeff Zycinski, stated that the BBC, and media in general, were complicit in undermining celebrities, including Winehouse. He said that public interest in the singer&#x27;s lifestyle did not make her lifestyle newsworthy. Rod McKenzie, editor of the BBC Radio One programme &quot;Newsbeat&quot;, replied: &quot;If you play [Amy Winehouse&#x27;s] music to a certain demographic, those same people want to know what&#x27;s happening in her private life. If you don&#x27;t cover it, you&#x27;re insulting young licence fee payers.&quot; In &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, English singer and songwriter Lily Allen was quoted to have said – &quot;I know Amy Winehouse very well. And she is very different to what people portray her as being. Yes, she does get out of her mind on drugs sometimes, but she is also a very clever, intelligent, witty, funny person who can hold it together. You just don&#x27;t see that side.&quot;

==Personal life==

Winehouse was raised Jewish and expressed pride in being Jewish, although she was not religious. During one interview, Winehouse said: &quot;[B]eing Jewish to me is about being together as a real family. It&#x27;s not about lighting candles and saying a bracha.&quot; Winehouse also frequently performed with a Star of David medallion.

In 2013, in memory of Winehouse, the Jewish Museum London ran an exhibition titled &quot;Amy Winehouse: A Family Portrait&quot;. The museum researched her paternal great-great-grandfather&#x27;s arrival from Minsk in 1890, and how the family finally settled in London, starting out in working-class jobs before gradually moving to middle-class jobs.

Winehouse had 14 known tattoos, including &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girl&quot; on her left arm for her father and a pin-up girl with the name &quot;Cynthia&quot; on her right arm in memory of her Jewish grandmother. In 2011, there were reports that Winehouse was in the process of adopting a 10-year-old girl from St. Lucia named Dannika Augustine. According to Dannika and her family, Amy had formed a strong bond with the poverty-stricken girl during her lengthy stays on the Caribbean island. Dannika referred to Amy as her mother and said they had a close, loving relationship. Her grandmother, Marjorie Lambert, confirmed that Amy had expressed a strong desire to adopt Dannika and was even willing to move to St. Lucia to be her full-time mother. However, Winehouse&#x27;s representative denied these claims, stating that the adoption story was not true.

===Relationships===
Winehouse dated chef-musician Alex Clare in 2006, while on a break from her on–off boyfriend and future husband, Blake Fielder-Civil. She and Clare lived together briefly, and in a pattern that Fielder-Civil would later repeat, Clare sold his story to the &quot;News of the World&quot;, which published it under the headline &quot;Bondage Crazed Amy Just Can&#x27;t Beehive in Bed.&quot;

Fielder-Civil, a former video production assistant, had dropped out of Bourne Grammar School and, aged 16, moved to London from his native Lincolnshire. He married Winehouse on 18 May 2007, in Miami Beach, Florida. In a June 2007 interview, Winehouse admitted she could sometimes be violent toward him after she had been drinking, saying: &quot;If he says one thing I don&#x27;t like, then I&#x27;ll chin him.&quot; In August 2007, they were photographed, bloodied and bruised, in the streets of London after an alleged fight, although she contended her injuries were self-inflicted. Winehouse&#x27;s parents and in-laws publicly reported their numerous concerns, the latter citing fears that the two might commit suicide. Fielder-Civil&#x27;s father encouraged fans to boycott Winehouse&#x27;s music, and Mitch Winehouse said this would not help. Fielder-Civil was quoted in a British tabloid as saying he introduced Winehouse to crack cocaine and heroin. During a visit with Mitch Winehouse at the prison in July 2008, Fielder-Civil reportedly said that he and Winehouse would cut themselves to ease the pain of withdrawal. Winehouse also reportedly confessed to having an affair in 2008.

From 21 July 2008 to 25 February 2009, Fielder-Civil was imprisoned following his guilty plea on charges of trying to pervert the course of justice and of grievous bodily harm with intent. The incident, in July 2007, involved his assault of a pub landlord that broke the victim&#x27;s cheekbone, and also saw Winehouse briefly arrested in connection with it. According to the prosecution, the landlord accepted £200,000 as part of a deal to &quot;effectively throw the [court] case and not turn up&quot;, and he testified that the money belonged to Winehouse, but she pulled out of a meeting with the men involved in the plot, to attend an awards ceremony. Mitch Winehouse, as manager of his daughter&#x27;s money, has denied the payoff came from her.

When Winehouse was spotted with aspiring actor Josh Bowman on holiday in Saint Lucia, in early January 2009, she said she was &quot;in love again, and I don&#x27;t need drugs.&quot; She commented that her &quot;whole marriage was based on doing drugs&quot; and that &quot;for the time being I&#x27;ve just forgotten I&#x27;m even married.&quot; On 12 January, Winehouse&#x27;s spokesman confirmed that &quot;papers have been received&quot; for what Fielder-Civil&#x27;s solicitor said were divorce proceedings based on a claim of adultery. In March, Winehouse was quoted in a magazine as saying, &quot;I still love Blake and I want him to move into my new house with me—that was my plan all along ... I won&#x27;t let him divorce me. He&#x27;s the male version of me and we&#x27;re perfect for each other.&quot; Nonetheless, an uncontested divorce was granted on 16 July 2009 and became final on 28 August 2009. Fielder-Civil received no money in the settlement.

Winehouse was in a relationship with a British writer and film director Reg Traviss, from early 2010 until her death. According to media reports and a biography written by Winehouse&#x27;s father, Traviss and Winehouse had planned to marry and intended to have children. However, conflicting reports state that Winehouse and Fielder-Civil had begun a relationship that same year and had even discussed remarriage.

In July 2008, when &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse if she was in a relationship with Pete Doherty, she replied: &quot;We&#x27;re just good friends&quot;, and added: &quot;I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he looked at me like I&#x27;d pooed on the floor. He wouldn&#x27;t do it. We&#x27;re just really close&quot;. However, after Winehouse&#x27;s death, Doherty said that he and Winehouse had been lovers at one point.

===Substance abuse and mental illness===
Winehouse&#x27;s troubles with substance abuse were the subject of much media attention over the years. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of &quot;Back to Black&quot;. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.

Winehouse told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the drugs were to blame for her hospitalisation and that &quot;I really thought that it was over for me then.&quot; Soon afterwards, Winehouse&#x27;s father commented that when he had made public statements regarding her problems he was using the media because it seemed the only way to get through to her. In an interview with &quot;The Album Chart Show&quot; on British television, Winehouse said she was manic depressive and not alcoholic, adding that that sounded like &quot;an alcoholic in denial&quot;. A US reporter writes that Winehouse was a &quot;victim of mental illness in a society that doesn&#x27;t understand or respond to mental illness with great effectiveness.&quot; According to forensic physician Dr Jason Payne-James, Winehouse may have suffered from borderline personality disorder (BPD). He explained she shows some symptoms for disorder such as extreme reactions to trauma like abandonment (when described as a symptom &quot;frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment&quot;), impulsive or reckless behaviours like substance use disorders, binge eating, recurrent suicidal ideation, self-cutting or self-harm, rapidly shifting intense emotional dysregulation, chronic feelings of emptiness or boredom, unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships, often characterised by alternating between extremes of idealisation and devaluation, also known as &quot;splitting&quot;, inappropriate, intense anger that can be difficult to control. Before her death Winehouse had been examined by a psychiatrist and psychologist and doctors recommended that she undergo dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). DBT is based upon the biosocial theory of mental illness and is the first therapy that has been experimentally demonstrated to be generally effective in treating borderline personality disorder.

In December 2007, Winehouse&#x27;s spokesman reported that the singer was in a physician-supervised programme and was channelling her difficulties by writing a lot of music. In January 2008, the British tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; posted a video in which Winehouse appeared to be smoking crack cocaine and speaking of having taken ecstasy and Valium. The event took place on Friday 18 January, in the early hours of the morning. Later that morning, Winehouse attended a remand hearing for her husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who was then awaiting trial on charges of perverting the course of justice. Shortly after the alleged crack cocaine incident, Winehouse&#x27;s father moved in with her, to keep her under &#x27;24-hour watch&#x27;. At this time, Island Records, her record label, announced the abandonment of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf. On 23 January 2008, the video was passed on to the Metropolitan Police, who questioned her on 5 February. No charges were brought. In late January, Winehouse reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment programme. On 26 March, Winehouse&#x27;s spokesman said she was &quot;doing well&quot;. Her record company reportedly believed that her recovery remained fragile. By late April 2008, her erratic behaviourincluding an allegation of assaultcaused fear that her drug rehabilitation efforts had been unsuccessful. Winehouse&#x27;s father and manager then sought to have her detained under the Mental Health Act of 1983. Her dishevelled appearance during and after a scheduled club night in September 2008 prompted new rumours of a relapse. Photographers were quoted as saying she appeared to have cuts on her arms and legs.

According to her physician, Winehouse quit using illegal substances in 2008. In an October 2010 interview, speaking of her decision to quit drugs, Winehouse said, &quot;I literally woke up one day and was like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to do this any more. However, alcohol emerged as a problem, with Winehouse abstaining for a few weeks and then lapsing into alcohol abuse. Her physician said that Winehouse was treated with Librium for alcohol withdrawal and anxiety and underwent psychological and psychiatric evaluations in 2010, but refused psychological therapy.

===Violence and legal difficulties===
In 2006, Winehouse admitted to punching a female fan in the face for criticising her for having a relationship with then-boyfriend Blake Fielder-Civil. She then attacked Fielder-Civil as he attempted to calm her down, kneeing him in the crotch. In October 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis. The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around £350). Winehouse first appealed the fines, but later dropped the appeal.

On 26 April 2008, Winehouse was cautioned after she admitted to police she slapped a 38-year-old man in the face, a &quot;common assault&quot; offence, her first of two. She voluntarily turned herself in and was held overnight. Police said, at her arrival she was &quot;in no fit state&quot; to be interviewed. Ten days later, Winehouse was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs after a video of her apparently smoking crack cocaine was passed to the police in January, but was released on bail a few hours later because they could not confirm, from the video, what she was smoking. The Crown Prosecution Service considered charging her, but cleared her when it could not establish that the substance in the video was a controlled drug. Some members of Parliament criticised the decision not to bring charges. Two London residents were subsequently convicted of conspiracy to supply cocaine and ecstasy to Winehouse, leading to a two-year prison sentence for one, and a two-year community order.

On 5 March 2009, Winehouse was arrested and charged with common assault following a claim by dancer Sherene Flash that Winehouse hit her in the eye at the September 2008 Prince&#x27;s Trust charity ball. Winehouse&#x27;s spokesperson announced the cancellation of the singer&#x27;s US Coachella Festival appearance in light of the new legal issue, and Winehouse pleaded not guilty in court on 17 March. At her trial on 23–24 July she was charged with &quot;deliberate and unjustifiable violence&quot; while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or another substance. She testified that she did not punch Flash, but tried to push her away because she was scared of her; she cited her worry that Flash would sell her story to a tabloid, Flash&#x27;s height advantage, and Flash&#x27;s &quot;rude&quot; behaviour. On 24 July Winehouse was found not guilty, citing that all but two of the witnesses were intoxicated at the time, and that medical evidence did not show &quot;the sort of injury that often occurs when there is a forceful punch to the eye.&quot;

On 19 December 2009, Winehouse was arrested for a third time on charges of common assault and public order offence after assaulting the front-of-house manager of the Milton Keynes Theatre when he asked her to move to a different seat after noisy participation in the pantomime playing, and advised her not to drink more than she already had. Winehouse pleaded guilty, and was given a conditional discharge.
===Paparazzi===
With the paparazzi taking photographs of her wherever they could, Winehouse obtained an injunction against a leading paparazzi agency, Big Pictures, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the resultant court order issued by the High Court in 2009 banned them from following her. Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing Winehouse in her home or the homes of her friends and relatives. According to a newspaper report, sources close to the singer said legal action was taken out of concern for the safety of Winehouse and those close to her.

===Respiratory and other health problems===
On 23 June 2008, Winehouse&#x27;s publicist corrected earlier misstatements by Mitch Winehouse that his daughter had early-stage emphysema, saying that she instead had signs of what could lead to early-stage emphysema. Mitch Winehouse had also stated that his daughter&#x27;s lungs were operating at 70 percent capacity and that she had an irregular heartbeat. He said that these problems had been caused by her chain smoking crack cocaine. The singer&#x27;s father also reported that doctors had warned Winehouse that, if she continued smoking crack cocaine, she would have to wear an oxygen mask and would eventually die. In a radio interview, Mitch Winehouse said the singer was responding &quot;fabulously&quot; to treatment, which included being covered with nicotine patches. British Lung Foundation spokesman Keith Prowse noted that this type of condition could be managed with treatment. Prowse also said the condition was not normal for a person her age but &quot;heavy smoking and inhaling other substances like drugs can age the lungs prematurely.&quot; Norman H. Edelman of the American Lung Association explained that if she stopped smoking, her lung functions would decline at the rate of a normal person, but continued smoking would lead to a more rapid decline in lung function.

Winehouse was released from the London Clinic 24 hours after returning from a temporary leave to perform at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 90th birthday celebration and at a concert in Glastonbury, and continued receiving treatment as an outpatient. In July 2008, Winehouse stated that she had been diagnosed with &quot;some areas of emphysema&quot; and said she was getting herself together by &quot;eating loads of healthy food, sleeping loads, playing my guitar, making music and writing letters to my husband every day.&quot; She also kept a vertical tanning bed in her flat. Winehouse began precautionary testing on her lungs and chest on 25 October 2008 at the London Clinic for what was reported as a chest infection, leaving and returning at will. She returned to the hospital on 23 November 2008 due to a reported reaction to her medication.

==Death==

Winehouse&#x27;s bodyguard said that he had arrived at her residence three days before her death and felt she had been somewhat intoxicated. Two days after, her mother likewise admitted she had acted &quot;out of it.&quot; This was the same day Winehouse had visited her doctor for one of her routine check-ups due to her fragile state, although no abnormalities were noted: &quot;The doctor was happy with her condition. When he left on Friday night he had no concerns. Less than 24 hours later she was found dead.&quot; After the check-up, Winehouse had called her doctor to confess her feelings regarding her codependency, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to die&quot;, alongside how she had attempted sobriety, but could not achieve it. These were Winehouse&#x27;s last recorded words, while her bodyguard&#x27;s final conversation with her included the quote: &quot;If I could, I would give it back just to walk down the street with no hassle.&quot;

Her bodyguard continued to observe her drinking moderately over the next few days since his arrival, and later said she had been &quot;laughing, listening to music and watching TV at 2 a.m. the day of her death&quot;. Another source claims she was watching old re-runs of past performances and reminiscing. At 10 a.m. BST on 23 July 2011, he observed her lying on her bed and tried (unsuccessfully) to rouse her. This did not raise much suspicion because she usually slept late after a night out. According to the bodyguard, shortly after 3p.m., he checked on her again and observed her lying in the same position as before, leading to a further check, in which he concluded that she was not breathing and had no pulse; he said he called emergency services. At 3:54p.m., two ambulances reached Winehouse&#x27;s home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that she had died. Her death at age 27 prompted media comparisons to other musician deaths at the same age, collectively named the 27 Club.

After her death was announced, media and camera crews appeared near Winehouse&#x27;s residence. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police cordoned off the street outside; they recovered one small and two large bottles of vodka from her room. After her death, the singer broke her second Guinness World Record: for the most songs by a woman to simultaneously appear on the UK singles chart, with eight. Winehouse&#x27;s record label, Universal Republic, released a statement that read in part: &quot;We are deeply saddened at the sudden loss of such a gifted musician, artist and performer.&quot;

With initially little verified information regarding the causes of Winehouse&#x27;s death, there was considerable speculation on the subject. Various reports speculated on a fatal Class A drug, such as ecstasy overdose, or a lethal cocktail. Winehouse&#x27;s father Mitch denied these claims, stating: &quot;Three years ago, Amy conquered her drug dependency. She was the happiest she has been for years.&quot; By the following month, August 2011, speculation about substance abuse being a factor in Winehouse&#x27;s death had been disproven by an official toxicology report released to the public which showed that no illegal substances had been identified in Winehouse&#x27;s system. The coroner&#x27;s report was released in October 2011, and it stated that Winehouse&#x27;s blood alcohol content was 416 per 100 (0.416%) at the time of her death, more than five times the legal drink-drive limit. According to the coroner, the &quot;unintended consequence&quot; of so much drink was her &quot;sudden and unexpected death&quot;, as it reached a &#x27;death by misadventure&#x27; verdict. Another inquest was ordered when it was ruled that the first coroner was &#x27;not qualified&#x27; for the role&quot;. The second inquest, delivered in January 2013, matched the conclusions of the first inquest, with coroner Dr. Shirley Radcliffe finding that &quot;She (Winehouse) voluntarily consumed alcohol, a deliberate act that took an unexpected turn in that it caused her death.&quot; The second inquest reached the verdict of misadventure due to alcohol poisoning.

On 17 December 2012, British authorities reopened the probe into Winehouse&#x27;s death. On 8 January 2013, a second inquest confirmed that Winehouse died of an accidental alcohol overdose. In a June 2013 interview, Alex Winehouse shared his belief that his sister&#x27;s eating disorder, and the consequent physical weakness, was the primary cause of her death:

Winehouse&#x27;s funeral was held on 26 July 2011 at Edgwarebury Lane Cemetery in North London, it was a private ceremony attended by family and friends. Her mother and father, Janis and Mitch Winehouse, close friends Nick Grimshaw and Kelly Osbourne, producer Mark Ronson, goddaughter Dionne Bromfield and her boyfriend Reg Traviss were among those in attendance at the private service led by Rabbi Frank Hellner. Her father delivered the eulogy, saying &quot;Goodnight, my angel, sleep tight. Mummy and Daddy love you ever so much.&quot; Carole King&#x27;s &quot;So Far Away&quot; closed the service with mourners singing along as it was one of Winehouse&#x27;s favourite songs. She was later cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. The family planned to sit a two-day shiva. On 16 September 2012, Winehouse&#x27;s ashes were buried alongside those of her grandmother Cynthia Levy at Edgwarebury Lane Cemetery.

==Legacy==

=== Achievements and critical appraisal ===
At the time of her death, Winehouse had sold over 1.75 million singles and over 3.98 million albums in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, she had sold about 3.4 million tracks and 2.7 million albums in the United States as of the same date. Among the awards and recognition for her debut album &quot;Frank&quot;, Winehouse earned an Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters for Best Contemporary Song (&quot;Stronger Than Me&quot;), a Brit Award nomination for Best British Female Solo Artist, and an inclusion in Robert Dimery&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Her second studio album, &quot;Back to Black&quot;, produced numerous nominations, including two Brit Awards (Best British Album, and won her Best British Female Solo Artist), six Grammy Awards (including five wins), four Ivor Novello Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, three World Music Awards, and it was nominated for the Mercury Prize (Album of the Year) and a MOBO Awards (Best UK Female). During her career, Winehouse received 23 awards from 60 nominations.

Winehouse was known for her deep, expressive contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul, (sometimes labelled as blue-eyed soul and neo soul), rhythm and blues, and jazz. The BBC&#x27;s Garry Mulholland called Winehouse &quot;the pre-eminent vocal talent of her generation&quot;. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Cyril Cordor, she was one of the UK&#x27;s premier singers during the 2000s. &quot;Fans and critics alike embraced her rugged charm, brash sense of humor, and distinctively soulful and jazzy vocals&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caroline Sullivan later wrote that &quot;her idolisation of Dinah Washington and the Ronettes distinguished her from almost all newly minted pop singers of the early 2000s, and her exceptionally-susceptible-to-heartbreak voice did the rest&quot;.

Soon after Winehouse&#x27;s death, a number of prominent critics assessed the singer&#x27;s legacy. Maura Johnston from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said, &quot;When she was on, Winehouse had few peers—she wasn&#x27;t an octave-jumper like other big divas of the moment, but her contralto had a snap to it that enriched even the simplest syllables with a full spectrum of emotion&quot;. Sasha Frere-Jones of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; proclaimed, &quot;Nobody can match Winehouse&#x27;s unique transitions or her utterly weird phrasings. She sounded like an original sixties soul star, developed when the landscape had no rules. But now untrammelled traditionalism is in the lead and her beautiful footnote has been cut short. American soul—through visionaries like Erykah Badu and Janelle Monáe and Jill Scott—had moved on. But Winehouse was a fine shepherd of the past.&quot;

On 13 February 2012, Winehouse was ranked 26th on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Women in Music&quot; list. In March 2017, singer-songwriter Bob Dylan said he was enjoying listening to Winehouse&#x27;s last record (&quot;Back to Black&quot;), and called her &quot;the last real individualist around&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Winehouse at number 83 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Adele has credited Winehouse&#x27;s success in making her and Welsh singer Duffy&#x27;s journey to the United States &quot;a bit smoother.&quot; Lady Gaga credited Winehouse with paving the way for her rise to the top of the charts, explaining that Winehouse made it easier for unconventional women to have mainstream pop success. Raphael Saadiq, Anthony Hamilton and John Legend said &quot;Amy Winehouse was produced by people who wanted to create a marketing coup. The positive side is that it reacquainted an audience with this music and played an introductory role for others. This reinvigorated the genre by overcoming the vintage aspect.&quot; Other artists that have credited Winehouse as an influence or for paving the way for them include Bruno Mars, Tove Lo, Jessie J, Emeli Sandé, Victoria Justice, Paloma Faith, Lana Del Rey, Sam Smith, Florence Welch, Halsey, Alessia Cara, Estelle, Daya, Jorja Smith, Lauren Jauregui and Billie Eilish.

After the release of &quot;Back to Black&quot;, record companies sought out female artists with a similar sound and fearless and experimental female musicians in general. Adele and Duffy were the second wave of artists with a sound similar to Winehouse&#x27;s. A third wave of female musicians that has emerged since the album was released are led by V V Brown, Florence and the Machine, La Roux and Little Boots. In March 2011, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; ran an article attributing the continuing wave of British female artists that have been successful in the United States to Winehouse and her absence. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine music editor Charles Aaron was quoted as saying &quot;Amy Winehouse was the Nirvana moment for all these women,&quot; &quot;They can all be traced back to her in terms of attitude, musical styles or fashion.&quot; According to Keith Caulfield, chart manager for &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Because of Amy, or the lack thereof, the marketplace was able to get singers like Adele, Estelle and Duffy,&quot; &quot;Now those ladies have brought on the new ones, like Eliza Doolittle, Rumer and Ellie.&quot;

===Amy Winehouse Foundation===
After the singer&#x27;s death by alcohol intoxication in July 2011, the Amy Winehouse Foundation was set up by Winehouse&#x27;s family and launched on 14 September 2011 (which would have been Winehouse&#x27;s 28th birthday). Its aim is to help vulnerable or disadvantaged young people, and it works with other charitable organisations to provide frontline support. Its central office is in North London, but it also has an office in New York (operating under the name &#x27;The Amy Winehouse Foundation US&#x27;). Jon Snow is a patron for the charity, with Barbara Windsor also before she died in 2020, and ambassadors include Jess Glynne, Patsy Palmer, Jessie Wallace, Keira Chaplin and Mica Paris. In October 2015 Mark Ronson became a patron. Amy&#x27;s brother Alex works full-time for the foundation, having given up his career as an online music journalist.

The charity itself works to prevent the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on young people and it also aims to support, inform and inspire vulnerable and disadvantaged young people to help them reach their full potential. On 12 March 2013, with the help of ex-addict Russell Brand, the Foundation launched the Amy Winehouse Foundation Resilience Programme For Schools across the UK which aims to provide effective education around drugs, alcohol and dealing with emotional issues.

=== Tributes ===

Many musical artists have since paid tribute to Winehouse including Nicki Minaj, M.I.A., Lady Gaga, Kelly Osbourne, Rihanna, George Michael, Adele, Dita Von Teese, Courtney Love, and the rock band Green Day, who wrote a song in her tribute titled &quot;Amy&quot;. In her 2012 album &quot;Banga&quot;, singer Patti Smith released &quot;This Is the Girl&quot;, written as an homage to Winehouse. Mark Ronson dedicated his UK number-one album &quot;Uptown Special&quot; to Winehouse, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m always thinking of you and inspired by you.&quot;

==== Artworks and exhibits ====

London&#x27;s Mall Galleries opened an exhibition in May 2008 that included a sculpture of Winehouse, titled &quot;Excess&quot;. The piece, created by Guy Portelli, had a miniature of the singer lying on top of a cracked champagne bottle, with a pool of spilled liquid underneath. The body was covered with what appeared to be tiny pills, while one outstretched hand held a glass. Another piece, a print titled &quot;Celebrity 1&quot; by artist Charlotte Suckling, was shown in the same exhibition.

Winehouse was immortalised at the world-famous London Madame Tussauds on 23 July 2008. Winehouse herself had expressed surprise at plans to make a waxwork of her, stating that she believed a person &#x27;had to be dead&#x27; before a waxwork was made of them. Winehouse did not make herself available for sittings for the Madame Tussauds waxwork, which was instead done from photos. A sculpture by Marco Perego, titled &quot;The Only Good Rock Star Is a Dead Rock Star&quot;, that depicts Winehouse lying in a pool of blood with an apple and a bullet hole in her head after being shot by American novelist and Beat poet William S. Burroughs (in a recreation of the accidental killing of his wife Joan Vollmer), went on on display in New York&#x27;s Half Gallery on 14 November 2008 with a sale price of US$100,000. Perego said of the sculpture: &quot;Rock stars are the sacrificial animals of society.&quot; Winehouse was not supportive of Peregro&#x27;s work, with her spokesperson stating: &quot;It&#x27;s a funny kind of tribute. The artist seems in thrall to a tabloid persona that is not the real Amy. People often use her image to sell their work.&quot;

Initial reports after her death stated that Winehouse had left a will, which had been altered after her divorce from Blake Fielder-Civil. However it transpired that Winehouse had not left a will; her estate, worth around £4 million, was inherited by her parents. Winehouse&#x27;s parents set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation to prevent harm from drug misuse among young people, with her brother Alex as an employee.
In 2012, Winehouse was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.

On 14 September 2014 (which would have been Winehouse&#x27;s 31st birthday), a statue of her by sculptor Scott Eaton was unveiled at Stables Market in Camden Town, North London. Fans and relatives gathered for the unveiling in Camden&#x27;s Stable Market. London-based Eaton, who sculpted the piece after being introduced to Winehouse&#x27;s father Mitch, said the statue was meant to capture her &quot;attitude and strength, but also give subtle hints of insecurity.&quot; Her father Mitch said of the statue: &quot;Now Amy will oversee the comings and goings of her home town forever... Amy was in love with Camden and it is the place her fans from all over the world associate her with.&quot;

An exhibit of Winehouse&#x27;s personal items, co-curated by her brother and sister-in-law, titled &quot;Amy Winehouse: A Family Portrait&quot;, was on display at the Jewish Museum London from 3 July 2013 until 15 September 2013, and later exhibited in San Francisco, 23 July 2015 to 1 November 2015. Display items, such as books and music, were featured together with captions written by Winehouse&#x27;s brother.

In 2018, the artist Dan Llywelyn Hall&#x27;s portrait of the singer, &quot;Amy&#x27;s Glance&quot;, was exhibited at the London Art Fair.

In March 2020, Winehouse&#x27;s name on a stone was unveiled on the new Music Walk of Fame in Camden, with her parents Mitch and Janis in attendance at the ceremony.

In 2020, an exhibition titled &quot;Beyond Black – The Style of Amy Winehouse&quot; opened at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. The exhibit mainly focused on Winehouse&#x27;s style and fashion, displaying outfits such as her iconic dresses, shoes, hair accessories, makeup bag as well as Winehouse&#x27;s personal belongings including her Grammy awards from 2008, handwritten lyrics, records and unseen home videos. The exhibition went on display in the U.S. from 17 January 2020 until 13 April 2020. A follow-up exhibition &quot;Amy: Beyond the Stage&quot; opened on 26 November 2021 until 10 April 2022 at the Design Museum in Kensington, London which also presented some of Winehouse&#x27;s personal belongings and focus on her fashion sense, as well as paying homage to her musical career. Also in November 2021, various of Winehouse&#x27;s personal items and famous dresses would later be auctioned at Julien&#x27;s Auctions in Los Angeles and made more than £3m, 30% going to the Amy Winehouse Foundation.

==== Films and memoirs ====
In late 2011, there were reports that Winehouse&#x27;s former boyfriend, Reg Traviss, was developing a film about her. Winehouse&#x27;s father Mitch Winehouse, who owns the copyright to his daughter&#x27;s music, said he would not authorise the use of her music for the film.

Winehouse&#x27;s parents have each written memoirs about their daughter and donated the proceeds from both books to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. In the introduction to Mitch Winehouse&#x27;s biography, titled &quot;Amy: My Daughter&quot; (2012), he explained: &quot;Apart from being her father, I was also her friend, confidant and adviser—not that she always took my advice, but she always heard me out.&quot; Her mother Janis published &quot;Loving Amy: A Mother&#x27;s Story&quot;, in 2014.

A documentary film, &quot;Amy&quot; (2015), directed by Asif Kapadia and produced by James Gay-Rees, was released on 3 July 2015. The film covers Winehouse&#x27;s life, her relationships, her struggles with substance abuse both before and after her career blossomed, and which eventually caused her death. The film received its première at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival on 16 May and has been reviewed as &quot;a tragic masterpiece&quot;, &quot;brilliant&quot;, &quot;heartbreaking&quot; and &quot;unmissable&quot;. The soundtrack of the same name was released on 30 October 2015, along with the DVD that includes music featured in the documentary by film composer Antônio Pinto and classic and some unreleased tracks by Winehouse. The film was highly acclaimed and received various accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 2016 Oscars, Best Music Film at the 2016 Grammy Awards, the BAFTA for Best Documentary, the MTV Movie Award for Best Documentary, in addition to a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best British Film.

On 9 October 2017, it was announced by Winehouse&#x27;s father Mitch that a West End/Broadway musical on Amy is in the works. Mitch Winehouse revealed the news at the Amy Winehouse Foundation Gala event in London.

In 2018, a documentary film based on Winehouse&#x27;s album &quot;Back to Black&quot;, &quot;Amy Winehouse – Back to Black&quot;, was released. It contains new interviews as well as archival footage. It was made by Eagle Vision and produced by Gil Cang. Released on DVD on 2 November 2018, the film features interviews by producers Ronson &amp; Remi, who worked half and half on the album, along with the Dap Kings, Remi&#x27;s music team, Ronnie Spector from the Ronettes and close ones to Winehouse, including Nick Shymansky, Juliette Ashby and Dionne Bromfield. The film is accompanied by &quot;An Intimate Evening in London,&quot; footage of a show Winehouse gave at Riverside Studios, London in 2008. In February 2019, Salaam Remi released a compilation album including the song &quot;Find My Love&quot; which is a posthumous collaboration between Winehouse and rapper Nas.

As the years passed since her death, talk began to grow of a film biopic of Amy Winehouse&#x27;s life. In October 2018, it was announced that Winehouse&#x27;s estate had signed a multi-million pound deal to make a film biopic about her life and career. In August 2021 it was reported that a film based on Daphne Barak&#x27;s 2010 book, &quot;Saving Amy&quot;, which chronicles the late singer&#x27;s final years, had been greenlighted by Halcyon Studios. However, in September 2021, Amy&#x27;s father and estate executor, Mitch, stated that was “100% not allowed.”

In July 2021, a new documentary titled &quot;Reclaiming Amy&quot; aired on BBC Two to mark the 10th anniversary of Winehouse&#x27;s death. The film was primarily based on the perspective and narrated by her mother Janis Winehouse-Collins and included intimate stories of those who were close to Winehouse until the end of her life, including close friends Naomi Parry (Winehouse&#x27;s stylist), Catriona Gourlay and Chantelle Dusette.

In July 2022, it was reported that a feature film biopic, entitled &quot;Back To Black&quot; (2024) was to be produced by StudioCanal UK, distributed by Focus Features and directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson—who previously made a biopic of The Beatles star John Lennon, &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot; (2009)—and directed &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; (2015). The script was written by Matt Greenhalgh and it was to be made with the full cooperation of Amy&#x27;s father Mitch, and her estate. In January 2023, it was revealed that British actress Marisa Abela would play the leading role of Winehouse and filming commenced later that month in London. In January 2024, a trailer for &quot;Back to Black&quot; was released along with a debut release date of April 12 in the UK.

The film was moderately successful at the box office, with a worldwide total of $51.1 million. The film attracted mixed reviews, with criticism for a selective depiction of Winehouse&#x27;s life, including the complete omission of Reg Traviss, and over-sympathetic depictions of Mitch Winehouse, and Blake Fielder-Civil, but praise for the acting.

<text>José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva (; 13 June 17636 April 1838) was a Brazilian statesman, naturalist, mineralist, professor and poet, born in Santos, São Paulo, then part of the Portuguese Empire. 

He was one of the most important mentors of Brazilian independence, and his actions were decisive for the success of Emperor Pedro I. He supported public education, was an abolitionist and suggested that a new national capital be created in Brazil&#x27;s underdeveloped interior (effected over a century later as Brasília). His career as naturalist was marked by the discovery of four new minerals.

== Life ==
In 1800, Bonifácio was appointed professor of geology at Coimbra, and soon after inspector-general of the Portuguese mines; and in 1812 he was made perpetual secretary of the Lisbon Academy of Sciences. Returning to the Brazil in 1819, he urged prince regent Pedro to resist the recall of the Lisbon court, and was appointed one of his ministers in 1821. When the independence of Brazil was declared, Bonifácio became minister of the interior and of foreign affairs; and when it was established, he was again elected by the Constituent Assembly. He was also the author of the abolition project in Brazil, presented to the Constituent Assembly in 1823. But his democratic principles resulted in his dismissal from office in July 1823.

=== Career in Europe ===
José Bonifácio spent part of his life in Europe. In his travels around Europe he studied chemistry and mineralogy with other scientists. He collected data, carried out scientific experiments and discovered four new minerals and eight previously unknown species. The mineral andradite is named after him. Among his other discoveries was petalite, a lithium-containing material, first discovered by Bonifácio toward the end of the 18th century on a trip to Sweden; it was in this mineral that Swedish chemists first discovered lithium. He also was the first to discover another important lithium-containing mineral, spodumene, from the same source, the island of Utö in the Stockholm Archipelago of Sweden.

In 1797 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Bonifácio graduated with degrees in Law and Natural Philosophy from the University of Coimbra, he joined the Lisbon Academy Sciences. He taught Geognosy at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. Knowing twelve languages, he could speak four.

=== Return to Brazil ===
In the year of 1819, he travelled back to Brazil where he continued to conduct scientific research. A talented man having an unquiet temperament, he was also appointed Minister for Kingdom and Overseas Affairs and became the &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister.
His relationship with the prince became incompatible and he decided to join the opposition. In 1823 he was exiled and went to live in Bordeaux where, in 1825, come out his &quot;Poesias Avulsas&quot; (Sundry Poetries). To publish them he used the pseudonym Américo Elísio. On the dissolution of the Assembly in November (the Night of Agony), he was arrested and banished to France, where he lived in exile near Bordeaux until 1829, when he was permitted to return to Brazil.
In 1831 when Dom Pedro I abdicated from the throne, he was appointed by the former Emperor to be the tutor of the Emperor&#x27;s son. Since he did not agree with the Regent&#x27;s government he tried to reestablish the Empire. After being again arrested in 1833 and tried for intriguing on behalf of Dom Pedro I, he passed the rest of his days in retirement at the city of Niterói. He lost his duties as tutor and was accused of being a traitor, but he was eventually pardoned.

In December 1836, he contracted tuberculosis. He died of the disease on 6 April 1838 in Niterói.

===Career in literature===
José Bonifácio had also been engaged in Literature. His work &quot;Poesias Avulsas&quot; that come out in Bordeaux were republished in Brazil, in 1861, by the publisher Laemmert. In Brazil it received the title &quot;Poesias&quot; (Poetries) and the publication had the coordination of Joaquim Norberto de Sousa. In 1942 Afrânio Peixoto prepared another issue through the Brazilian Academy of Letters. This work, prefaced with a text by Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, was also published in a collection, as Volume I, idealized by the &quot;Instituto Nacional do Livro&quot; (The National Book Institute), appearing in 1946 with the title &quot;Poesias de Américo Elísio&quot; [Américo Elísio&#x27;s Poetry]. His poetry shows a naturalistic pantheism that expresses his intellectual character and scientific curiosity.

His scientific, political and social works are published in Volume III, compiled and reproduced by Edgar Cerqueira Falcão with the title &quot;Obras científicas, politicas e sociais de José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva.&quot; Its third edition came out in 1963 to celebrate the bicentennial of the Patriarch of the Independence.

The mineral andradite was named after José Bonifácio.

<text>Henri Hureau de Sénarmont () (6 September 1808 – 30 June 1862) was a French mineralogist and physicist. 

He was born in Broué, Eure-et-Loir. From 1822 to 1826, he studied at the École Polytechnique in Paris, then furthered his education at the École des Mines. During the course of his career, he became engineer-in-chief of mines, and professor of mineralogy and director of studies at the École des Mines in Paris.

Sénarmont was distinguished for his research on polarization and demonstrating the anisotropy of heat diffusion in a crystal, and on the artificial formation of minerals. A polarized light retardation compensator known as a &quot;Sénarmont prism polarizer&quot; is named after him, as is senarmontite, a mineral that he described in 1851.

He wrote essays and prepared maps on the geology of Seine-et-Marne and Seine-et-Oise for the Geological Survey of France (1844). He admired the work of Augustin Fresnel, and endeavored to prepare of an entire edition of Fresnel&#x27;s works. The project was far enough advanced prior to his death that it could be completed by other authors (&quot;Oeuvres complètes d&#x27;Augustin Fresnel&quot;, 1866–70).

<text>Walter E. Mooney (June 6, 1925 – March 1, 1990) was a MIT educated engineer, aircraft designer, pilot and model aircraft designer who lived in San Diego, California. He was well known professionally for his full scale aircraft efforts for Convair division of General Dynamics but more popularly known for the many plans and articles published in the magazines &quot;Model Airplane News&quot;, &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, and &quot;Aero Modeller&quot; in the 1960s. He was once featured as a daredevil glider pilot on the 1973 TV series &quot;Thrill Seekers&quot;. He designed the ROHR Two-175 Experimental Aircraft almost put in production to compete against the Cessna 172 in 1971.

The Flying Aces model club of Washington has held a Walt Mooney Memorial model airplane meet named in his honor.

<doc id="939591" wikidata="Q397996" url="?curid=939591" title="Aguasabon River">
<text>The Aguasabon River is a river in Thunder Bay District, Ontario, Canada. The river originates at Chorus Lake and empties into Lake Superior near the community of Terrace Bay. When the Canadian Pacific Railway was being built 1882-1885, the river was known as the Black River at mileage 857 miles from Montreal, not to be confused with the Black River near Heron Bay.

The Aguasabon is in length, and plunges down at the Aguasabon Falls. The river follows fractures in the 2.6 billion-year-old bedrock, and the exposed rock is granodiorite.

==Aguasabon station==

Aguasabon Station is a dam and two unit hydroelectric power plant run by Ontario Power Generation. It generates power to support a Kimberly-Clark pulp and paper plant at Terrace Bay.

In 1945, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario began preliminary survey work for a planned hydroelectric facility in the Terrace Bay area. Construction commenced in 1946 and the facility began operating in 1948. The development required five million hours of labour, a network of access roads, and the erection of 25 buildings including staff housing, a hospital, administration office, pump house, machine shops and laundry. The dam enlarged Hays Lake to five hundred times its original size, and forced the relocation of Ontario Highway 17, requiring a new bridge be constructed. As part of the project, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario diverted the headwaters of the Kenogami River to flow south into Long Lake and into the Aguasabon River system to Lake Superior, rather than flowing north towards Hudson Bay via the Albany River.

<doc id="939599" wikidata="Q645426" url="?curid=939599" title="1998–2002 Argentine great depression">
<text>The 1998–2002 Argentine great depression was an economic depression in Argentina, which began in the third quarter of 1998 and lasted until the second quarter of 2002. It followed fifteen years of stagnation and a brief period of free-market reforms. The depression, which began after the Russian and Brazilian financial crises, caused widespread unemployment, riots, the fall of the government, a default on the country&#x27;s foreign debt, the rise of alternative currencies and the end of the peso&#x27;s fixed exchange rate to the US dollar. The economy shrank by 28 per cent from 1998 to 2002. In terms of income, over 50 per cent of Argentines lived below the official poverty line and 25 per cent were indigent (their basic needs were unmet); seven out of ten Argentine children were poor at the depth of the crisis in 2002.

By the first half of 2003, GDP growth had returned, surprising economists and the business media, and the economy grew by an average of 9% for five years. Argentina&#x27;s GDP exceeded pre-crisis levels by 2005, and Argentine debt restructuring that year resulted in resumed payments on most of its defaulted bonds; a second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of bonds out of default to 93%, though holdout lawsuits led by vulture funds remained ongoing. Bondholders who participated in the restructuring have been paid punctually and have seen the value of their bonds rise. Argentina repaid its International Monetary Fund loans in full in 2006, but had a long dispute with the 7% of bond-holders left. In April 2016 Argentina came out of the default when the new government decided to repay the country&#x27;s debt, paying the full amount to the vulture/hedge funds.

==Origins==

Argentina&#x27;s many years of military dictatorship (alternating with weak, short-lived democratic governments) had already caused significant economic problems prior to the 2001 crisis, particularly during the self-styled National Reorganization Process in power from 1976 to 1983. A right-wing executive, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, was appointed Economy Minister at the outset of the dictatorship, and a neoliberal economic platform centered around anti-labour, monetarist policies of financial liberalization was introduced. Budget deficits jumped to 15% of GDP as the country went into debt for the state takeover of over $15 billion in private debts as well as unfinished projects, higher defense spending, and the Falklands War. By the end of the military government in 1983, the foreign debt had ballooned from $8 billion to $45 billion, interest charges alone exceeded trade surpluses, industrial production had fallen by 20%, real wages had lost 36% of their purchasing power, and unemployment, calculated at 18% (though official figures claimed 5%), was at its highest point since the 1929 Great Depression.

Democracy was restored in 1983 with the election of President Raúl Alfonsín. The new government intended to stabilize the economy and in 1985 introduced austerity measures and a new currency, the Argentine austral, the first of its kind without &quot;peso&quot; in its name. Fresh loans were required to service the $5 billion in annual interest charges, however, and when commodity prices collapsed in 1986, the state became unable to service this debt.

During the Alfonsin administration, unemployment did not substantially increase, but real wages fell by almost half to the lowest level in fifty years. Prices for state-run utilities, telephone service, and gas increased substantially.

Confidence in the plan, however, collapsed in late 1987, and inflation, which had already averaged 10% per month (220% per year) from 1975 to 1988, spiraled out of control. Inflation reached 200% for the month in July 1989, peaking at 5000% for the year. Amid riots, Alfonsín resigned five months before the end of his term; Carlos Menem took office in July.

==1990s==
After a second bout of hyperinflation, Domingo Cavallo was appointed Minister of the Economy in January 1991. On 1 April, he fixed the value of the austral at 10,000 per US dollar. Australs could be freely converted to dollars at banks. The Central Bank of Argentina had to keep its US dollar foreign-exchange reserves at the same level as the cash in circulation. The initial aim of such measures was to ensure the acceptance of domestic currency because after the 1989 and 1990 hyperinflation, Argentines had started to demand payment in US dollars. This regime was later modified by a law (&quot;Ley de Convertibilidad&quot;) that restored the Argentine peso as the national currency.

The convertibility law reduced inflation sharply, preserving the value of the currency. That raised the quality of life for many citizens, who could again afford to travel abroad, buy imported goods or ask for credit in dollars at traditional interest rates. The fixed exchange rate reduced the cost of imports, which produced a flight of dollars from the country and a massive loss of industrial infrastructure and employment in industry.

Argentina, however, still had external public debt that it needed to roll over. Government spending remained too high, and corruption was rampant. Argentina&#x27;s public debt grew enormously during the 1990s without showing that it could service the debt. The IMF kept lending money to Argentina and extending its payment schedules.

Reports indicate that tax evasion and money transfers to offshore banks played a role in capital outflows.

A congressional committee started investigations in 2001 over accusations that Central Bank Governor Pedro Pou, a prominent advocate of dollarization, and members of the board of directors had overlooked money laundering within Argentina&#x27;s financial system. Clearstream was accused of being instrumental in this process.

Other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Brazil (both important trade partners for Argentina) faced economic crises of their own, leading to mistrust of the regional economy. The influx of foreign currency provided by the privatization of state companies had ended. After 1999, Argentine exports were harmed by the devaluation of the Brazilian real against the dollar. A considerable international revaluation of the dollar directly weakened the peso relative to Argentina&#x27;s trading partners: Brazil (30% of total trade flows) and the eurozone (23% of total trade flows).

After having grown by over 50% from 1990 to 1998, Argentina&#x27;s GDP declined by 3% in 1999 and the country entered what became a three-year-long recession. President Fernando de la Rúa was elected in 1999 on a reform platform that nevertheless sought to maintain the peso&#x27;s parity with the dollar. He inherited a country with high unemployment (15%), lingering recession, and continued high levels of borrowing. In 1999, economic stability became economic stagnation (even deflation at times), and the economic measures taken did nothing to avert it. The government continued its predecessor&#x27;s economic policies. Devaluing the peso by abandoning the exchange peg was considered political suicide and a recipe for economic disaster. By the end of the century, complementary currencies had emerged.

While the provinces of Argentina had always issued complementary currency in the form of bonds and drafts to manage shortages of cash, the scale of such borrowing reached unprecedented levels during this period. They became called &quot;quasi-currencies&quot;, the strongest of them being Buenos Aires&#x27;s Patacón. The national government issued its own quasi-currency, the LECOP.

In a 2001 interview, journalist Peter Katel identified three factors that converged &quot;the worst possible time&quot; that made the Argentine economy unravel:

# The fixed exchange rate between Argentine peso and the US dollar decided by Cavallo.
# The large amounts of borrowing by Menem.
# An increase in debt from reduced tax revenues.

==Currency==
The 2002 crisis of the Argentine peso, however, shows that even a currency board arrangement cannot be completely safe from a possible collapse. When the peso was first linked to the U.S. Dollar at parity in February 1991 under the Convertibility Law, initial economic effects were quite positive: Argentina&#x27;s chronic inflation was curtailed dramatically and foreign investment began to pour in, leading to an economic boom. Over time, however, the peso appreciated against the majority of currencies as the U.S. Dollar became increasingly stronger in the second half of the 1990s. A strong peso hurt exports from Argentina and caused a protracted economic downturn that eventually led to the abandonment of the peso-dollar parity in 2002. This change, in turn, caused severe economic and political distress in the country. The unemployment rate rose above 20 per cent and inflation reached a monthly rate of about 20 per cent in April 2002. In contrast, Hong Kong was able to successfully defend its currency board arrangement during the Asian financial crisis, a major stress test for the arrangement. Although there is no clear consensus on the causes of the Argentine crisis, there are at least three factors that are related to the collapse of the currency board system and ensuing economic crisis:
# The lack of fiscal discipline
# Labour market inflexibility
# Contagion from the financial crises in Russia and Brazil.

While the currency crisis is over, the debt problem has not been completely resolved. The government of Argentina ceased all debt payments in December 2001 in the wake of persistent recession and rising social and political unrest. In 2004, the Argentine government made a &#x27;final&#x27; offer amounting to a 75 per cent reduction in the net present value of the debt. Foreign bondholders rejected this offer and asked for an improved offer. In early 2005, bondholders finally agreed to the restructuring, under which they took a cut of about 70 per cent on the value of their bond holdings.

==Rates, riots, resignations and default==
When a short boom in the early 1990s of portfolio investment from abroad ended in 1995, Argentina became reliant on the IMF to provide the country with low-interest access to credit and to guide its economic reforms. When the recession began in 1999, the national deficit widened to 2.5% of GDP, and its external debt surpassed 50% of GDP. Seeing the levels as excessive, the IMF advised the government to balance its budget by implementing austerity measures to sustain investor confidence. The De la Rúa administration implemented $1.4 billion in cuts in its first weeks in office in late 1999. In June 2000, with unemployment at 14% and projections of 3.5% GDP for the year, austerity was furthered by $938 million in spending cuts and $2 billion in tax increases.

GDP growth projections proved to be overly optimistic (instead of growing, real GDP shrank 0.8%), and lagging tax receipts prompted the government to freeze spending and cut retirement benefits again. In early November, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s placed Argentina on a credit watch, and a treasury bill auction required paying 16% interest (up from 9% in July, the second-highest rate of any country in South America at the time.

Rising bond yields forced the country to turn to major international lenders, such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the US Treasury, which would lend to the government below market rates if it complied with conditions. Several more rounds of belt-tightening followed. José Luis Machinea resigned in March 2001. He was replaced with Ricardo López Murphy, who lasted less than three weeks in office before being replaced with Cavallo.

Standard and Poor&#x27;s cut the credit rating of the country&#x27;s bonds to B− in July 2001. Cavallo reacted by offering bondholders a swap: longer-term, higher-interest bonds would be exchanged for bonds due in 2010. The &quot;megaswap&quot; (&quot;megacanje&quot;), as Cavallo referred to it, was accepted by most bondholders, and it delayed up to $30 billion in payments that would have been due by 2005; but it also added $38 billion in interest payments in the out years; of the $82 billion in bonds that eventually had to be restructured (triggering a wave of holdout lawsuits), 60% were issued during the 2001 megaswap.

Cavallo also attempted to curb the budget crisis by instituting an unpopular across-the-board pay cut in July of up to 13% to all civil servants and an equivalent cut to government pension benefits, De la Rúa&#x27;s seventh austerity round—triggering nationwide strikes, and from August, it paid salaries of the highest-paid employees in IOUs instead of money. That further depressed the weakened economy, the unemployment rate rose to 16.4% in August 2001 up from a 14.7% a month earlier, and it reached 20% by December.

Public discontent with the economic conditions was expressed in the nationwide election. De la Rúa&#x27;s alliance lost its majority in both chambers of Congress. Over 20% of voters chose to give blank or defaced ballots rather than indicate support of any candidate.

The crisis intensified when, on 5 December 2001, the IMF refused to release a US$1.3 billion tranche of its loan, citing the failure of the Argentine government to reach its budget deficit targets, and it demanded budget cuts, 10% of the federal budget. On 4 December, Argentine bond yields stood at 34% over U.S. treasury bonds, and, by 11 December, the spread jumped to 42%.

By the end of November 2001, people began withdrawing large sums of dollars from their bank accounts, turning pesos into dollars, and sending them abroad, which caused a bank run. On 2 December, the government enacted measures, informally known as the &quot;corralito&quot;, which allowed for only minor sums of cash to be withdrawn, initially $250 a week.

===December 2001 riots and political turmoil===

The bank withdrawal freeze led to widespread protests, particularly in Buenos Aires. They engaged in protests known as &quot;cacerolazo&quot; (banging pots and pans). Initially peaceful, these demonstrations later involved damage to property, including banks and foreign-owned companies, particularly those from the United States and Europe. 
Confrontations between the police and citizens became common, and fires were set on Buenos Aires avenues. De la Rúa declared a state of emergency, but the situation worsened, precipitating the violent protests of 20 and 21 December 2001 in Plaza de Mayo, where clashes between demonstrators and the police ended up with several people dead and precipitated the fall of the government. De la Rúa eventually fled the Casa Rosada in a helicopter on 21 December.

Following the presidential succession procedures established in the Constitution of Argentina, the Senate chairman was next in the line of succession in the absence of the president and the vice-president. Accordingly, Ramón Puerta took office as a caretaker head of state, and the Legislative Assembly (a joint session of both chambers of Congress) was convened.

Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, the governor of San Luis Province, was eventually appointed as the new interim president.

====Debt default====
During the last week of 2001, the administration defaulted on the larger part of the public debt, US$132 billion, a seventh of all the money borrowed by the Third World.

Politically, the most heated debate involved the date of the following elections. Proposals ranged from March 2002 to October 2003, the end of De la Rúa&#x27;s term.

Rodríguez Saá&#x27;s economic team came up with a scheme designed to preserve the convertibility regime, dubbed the &quot;Third Currency&quot; Plan. It consisted of creating a new, non-convertible currency, the &quot;Argentino&quot;, that would coexist with convertible pesos and US dollars. It would circulate as cash, or but not in checks, promissory notes, or other instruments, which could be denominated in pesos or dollars. It would be partially guaranteed with federally managed land to counterbalance inflationary tendencies.

Argentines having legal status would be used to redeem all complementary currency already in circulation; their acceptance as a means of payment was quite uneven. It was hoped that convertibility would restore public confidence, and the non-convertible nature of this currency would allow for a measure of fiscal flexibility (unthinkable with pesos) to ameliorate the crippling recession. Critics called the plan merely a &quot;controlled devaluation&quot; but its advocates countered that since controlling a devaluation is perhaps its thorniest issue, that criticism was a praise in disguise. The plan had enthusiastic supporters among mainstream economists (the most well-known being perhaps Martín Redrado, a former Banco Central de la República Argentina president) citing technical arguments. However, it was not implemented because the Rodríguez Saá government lacked the required political support.

Rodriguez Saá lost the support of his own Justicialist Party and resigned before the end of the year. The Legislative Assembly convened again, appointing Peronist Senator Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos Aires Province, who had been the runner-up in the 1999 race for the presidency.

==End of fixed exchange rate==

In January 2002, after much deliberation, Duhalde abandoned the fixed exchange rate that had been in place for ten years. In a matter of days, the peso lost a large part of its value in the unregulated market. A provisional &quot;official&quot; exchange rate was set at 1.4 pesos per US dollar.

In addition to the &quot;corralito&quot;, the Ministry of Economy dictated the &quot;pesificación&quot;; all bank accounts denominated in dollars would be converted to pesos at an official rate. Deposits would be converted at 1.40 ARS per dollar and debt was converted on 1 to 1 basis. The exchange rate spiked as depositors converted their peso deposits back into US dollars. By October 2002, depositors who withdraw lost 50% of their value in dollars. That angered most savings holders and attempts were made to declare it unconstitutional.

After a few months, the exchange rate was mostly a floating exchange rate. The peso further depreciated, which prompted increased inflation. Argentina depended heavily on imports but then could not replace them locally.

Inflation and unemployment worsened during 2002. Then, exchange rate had reached nearly 4 pesos per dollar, and the accumulated inflation since the devaluation was about 80%, considerably less than predicted by most orthodox economists. The quality of life of the average Argentine was lowered proportionally. Many businesses closed or went bankrupt, many imported products became virtually inaccessible, and salaries were left as they were before the crisis.

Since the supply of pesos did not meet the demand for cash (even after the devaluation), complementary currencies kept circulating alongside them. Fears of hyperinflation as a consequence of devaluation quickly eroded their attractiveness. Their acceptability now ultimately depended on the state&#x27;s irregular willingness to take them as payment of taxes and other charges.

While the regional currency was frequently accepted at the same value as the peso, Entre Ríos Province&#x27;s &quot;Federal&quot; fared among the worst, discounted by an average 30% as even the provincial government that had issued them was reluctant to accept them. There were also frequent rumors that the first state would banish complementary currency overnight, leaving their holders with useless printed paper.

===Immediate effects===
Aerolíneas Argentinas was one of the most affected Argentine companies, canceling all international flights for various days in 2002. The airline came close to bankruptcy but survived. 

Several thousand homeless and jobless Argentines found work as &quot;cartoneros&quot;, cardboard collectors. An estimate in 2003 had 30,000 to 40,000 people scavenging the streets for cardboard to sell to recycling plants. Such desperate measures were common because of the unemployment rate, nearly 25%.

Argentine agricultural products were rejected in some international markets for fear that they might have been damaged by the chaos. The US Department of Agriculture put restrictions on Argentine food and drug exports.

==Recovery==

Duhalde eventually stabilised the situation somewhat and called for elections. On 25 May 2003, Néstor Kirchner took office as the new president. Kirchner kept Duhalde&#x27;s Minister of Economy, Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna, a respected economist with centrist views, showed a considerable aptitude at managing the crisis, with the help of heterodox measures.

The economic outlook was completely different from that of the 1990s. The devalued peso made Argentine exports cheap and competitive abroad and discouraged imports. In addition, the high price of soybeans in the international market produced massive amounts of foreign currency; China became a major buyer of Argentina&#x27;s soy products.

The government encouraged import substitution and accessible credit for businesses, staged an aggressive plan to improve tax collection, and allocated large sums for social welfare but controlled expenditure in other fields.

The peso slowly rose, reaching a 3-to-1 rate to the dollar. Agricultural exports grew and tourism returned. The huge trade surplus ultimately caused such an inflow of dollars that the government was forced to begin intervening to keep the peso from rising further, which would have adversely affected budget balances by limiting export tax revenues and discouraged further reindustrialisation. The central bank started rebuilding its dollar reserves.

By December 2005, foreign currency reserves had reached $28 billion (they were later reduced by the payment of the full debt to the IMF in ). The downside of this reserve accumulation strategy is that US dollars had to be bought with freshly issued pesos, which risked inflation. The Central Bank sterilized its purchases by buying Treasury letters. In this way the exchange rate stabilised to about 3:1.
The currency exchange issue was complicated by two opposing factors: a sharp increase in imports since 2004, which raised the demand for dollars, and the return of foreign investment, which brought fresh currency from abroad, after the successful restructuring of about three-quarters of the external debt. The government set up controls and restrictions aimed at keeping short-term speculative investment from destabilising financial markets. The country faced a potential debt crisis in late July 2014, when a New York judge ordered Argentina to pay hedge funds the full interest on bonds it had swapped at a discount rate during 2002. If the judgement proceeded, Argentina argued, the country would become insolvent and have a second debt default.

Argentina&#x27;s recovery suffered a minor setback in 2004, when rising industrial demand caused a short-lived energy crisis. Argentina continued to grow strongly, however, and GDP jumped 8.8% in 2003, 9.0% in 2004, 9.2% in 2005, 8.5% in 2006 and 8.7% in 2007. Though wages averaged a 17% annual increase from 2002 to 2008, and rising 25% in the year to May 2008, inflation ate away at the increases: 12.5% in 2005; 10% in 2006; nearly 15% in 2007, and over 20% during 2008. The government was accused of manipulating inflation statistics, and &quot;The Economist&quot; began to turn to private sources instead. The surveying volume prompted the government to increase export tariffs and to pressure retailers into one price freeze after another in a bid to stabilize prices but with little effect.

While unemployment has been considerably reduced (it has hovered around 7% since 2011), Argentina has so far failed to reach an equitable distribution of income. Nevertheless, economic recovery after 2002 was accompanied by significant improvements in income distribution: in 2002, the richest 10% absorbed 40% of all income, compared to 1.1% for the poorest 10% (36 times); but by 2013, the former received 27.6% of income, and the latter, 2% (14 times). That level of inequality compares favorably to levels in most of Latin America and, in recent years, the United States as well.

Living standards recovered significantly after growth resumed in 2003. Even using private inflation estimates, real wages rose by around 72% from their low point, in 2003, to 2013. Argentina&#x27;s domestic new auto market recovered especially quickly from a low of 83,000 in 2002 (a fifth the levels of the late 1990s) to a record 964,000 in 2013.

==Cooperatives==
During the economic collapse, many business owners and foreign investors sent their money overseas. As a result, many small and medium enterprises closed for lack of capital. The majority of their workers, faced with a sudden loss of employment and no source of income, decided to reopen the closed facilities on their own as self-managed cooperatives.

Worker cooperatives include the factory Zanon (FaSinPat), the four-star Hotel Bauen, the suit factory Brukman, and the printing press Chilavert. In some cases, former owners sent police to remove workers from the workplaces; that was sometimes successful but in other cases, workers defended occupied workplaces against the state, the police, and the bosses.

A survey by an Buenos Aires newspaper found that around a third of the population had participated in general assemblies. The assemblies used to take place in street corners and public spaces, and they generally discussed ways of helping each other in the face of eviction, or organizing around issues such as health care, collective food buying, or food distribution programs. Some created new structures of health care and schooling. Neighborhood assemblies met once a week in a large assembly to discuss issues that affected the larger community. In 2004, &quot;The Take&quot;, a documentary, was released on the assemblies.

==Effects on wealth distribution==
Although GDP grew consistently and quickly after 2003, it did not reach the levels of 1998, the last year before the crisis, until late 2004. Other macroeconomic indicators followed suit. A study by Equis, an independent counseling organization, found out that two measures of economic inequality, the Gini coefficient and the wealth gap between the 10% poorest and the 10% richest among the population, grew continuously from 2001 to March 2005.

Similar statistics are available from the World Bank.

==Debt restructuring==

When the default was declared in 2002, foreign investment stopped, and capital flow ceased almost completely and immediately. The government faced severe challenges in trying to refinance its debt.

The government reached an agreement in 2005 by which 76% of the defaulted bonds were exchanged for other bonds at a nominal value of 25 to 35% of the original and at longer terms. A second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of bonds out of default to 93%, but some creditors have still not been paid. Foreign currency denominated debt thus fell as a percentage of GDP from 150% in 2003 to 8.3% in 2013.

==Criticism of IMF==
The IMF accepted no discounts in its part of the Argentine debt. Some payments were refinanced or postponed on agreement. However, IMF authorities at times expressed harsh criticism of the discounts and actively lobbied for the private creditors.

In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 2004, Kirchner said, &quot;An urgent, tough, and structural redesign of the International Monetary Fund is needed, to prevent crises and help in [providing] solutions.&quot; Implicitly referencing the fact that the intent of the original Bretton Woods system was to encourage economic development, Kirchner warned that the IMF today must &quot;change that direction, which took it from being a lender for development to a creditor demanding privileges.&quot;

During the weekend of 1–2 October 2004, at the annual meeting of the IMF/World Bank, leaders of the IMF, the European Union, the Group of Seven industrialised nations, and the Institute of International Finance (IIF), warned Kirchner that Argentina had to come to an immediate debt-restructuring agreement with creditors, increasing its primary budget surplus to slow debt increases and imposing structural reforms to prove to the world financial community that it deserved loans and investment.

In 2005, after turning its primary surplus into an actual surplus, Argentina began paying the IMF on schedule, with the intention of regaining financial independence. On 15 December 2005, following a similar action by Brazil, Kirchner suddenly announced that Argentina would pay the whole debt to the IMF. The debt payments, totaling US$9.810 billion, were previously scheduled as instalments until 2008. Argentina paid it with the central bank&#x27;s foreign currency reserves. The payment was made on 6 January 2006.

In a June 2006 report, a group of independent experts hired by the IMF to revise the work of its Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) stated that the assessment of the Argentine case suffered from manipulation and lack of collaboration on the part of the IMF; the IEO is claimed to have unduly softened its conclusions to avoid criticizing the IMF&#x27;s board of directors.

<doc id="939602" wikidata="Q445553" url="?curid=939602" title="Prince Charles, Count of Flanders">
<text>Prince Charles, Count of Flanders (, ; 10 October 1903 – 1 June 1983) was a member of the Belgian royal family who served as regent of Belgium from 1944 until 1950, while a judicial commission investigated his elder brother, King Leopold III of Belgium, as to whether he betrayed the Allies of World War II by an allegedly premature surrender in 1940 and collaboration with the Nazis during the occupation of Belgium. Charles&#x27; regency ended when Leopold was allowed to return to Belgium. Shortly after returning and resuming his monarchical duties, Leopold abdicated in favour of his son, Baudouin.

During the Second World War Charles was known as General du Boc, in order to hide his identity for security reasons. He had an association with RAF Hullavington where many top officers from Allied nations were based or transported to and from.

==Early life==
Born in Brussels, Charles was the second son of King Albert I of Belgium and Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. During World War I, the children of the Belgian royal family were sent to United Kingdom while King Albert I remained in Belgium behind the Yser Front. In 1915 Prince Charles began attending Wixenford School in Wokingham, Berkshire, and in 1917 proceeded to the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and two years later to Dartmouth. In 1926 he received the honorary rank of sub-lieutenant in the British Royal Navy, with promotion to honorary lieutenant the following year. Later in 1926 he returned to Belgium and began attending the Royal Military School of Brussels.

==Regency==
Prince Charles was appointed Regent of Belgium when the German occupation of his country ended in 1944. The role of his elder brother King Leopold III during the Second World War, as well as Leopold&#x27;s marriage to Mary Lilian Baels, was questioned and he became a controversial monarch.

Charles&#x27;s regency was dominated by the events resulting from the German occupation and the controversies around his brother Leopold. This period had an important impact on events in later decades. During his regency, important economic and political decisions were taken.

Belgium managed to jump-start its national economy with the aid of American assistance provided under the Marshall Plan. The building sector was stimulated by government grants to repair war-damaged buildings and to build social housing. The financial sector was sanitized through the &quot;Operation Gutt&quot; (after its architect, Camille Gutt), whereby illegally gained profits during the war were targeted. A social welfare system was introduced and a system was set up to govern labour relations.

Furthermore, women obtained the right to vote in parliamentary elections in 1948.

Also during his regency the Benelux customs union was formed, Belgium became a member state of the United Nations, and the North Atlantic Treaty was signed.

In 1950, Charles&#x27;s regency ended when Leopold III returned to Belgium and resumed his monarchical duties, following a plebiscite. Charles retired from public life, taking up residence in Ostend and becoming involved in artistic pursuits. Having taken up painting, he signed his works: &quot;Karel van Vlaanderen&quot; (Charles of Flanders).

He was the 377th knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.

Charles had a natural daughter, Isabelle Wybo, born in 1938 as the result of a relationship with Jacqueline Wehrli, the daughter of a Brussels baker. Her existence was largely unknown until a biography of the prince was published in 2003. Wybo made an official appearance with her first cousin-once removed, Prince Laurent in 2012.

He died on 1 June 1983 in Ostend, predeceasing his elder brother by a few months, and was buried at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels.

In his will he left the Empress Josephine&#x27;s diamond tiara to his sister, Marie-José.

==Alleged marriage==
It is reported that Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, married Louise Marie Jacqueline Peyrebrune (16 February 1921, in La Réole – 15 September 2014, in Saint-Hilaire-de-la-Noaille), formerly Mrs. Georges Schaack, daughter of Alfred Peyrebrune and Marie Madeleine Triaut, in a religious ceremony in Paris on 14 September 1977. This marriage has been mentioned in every edition of the revived &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;. However &quot;L&#x27;Allemagne Dynastique&quot; doubts this assertion, affirming instead that not only was there no civil marriage but that there was also no religious one (which could not take place before a civil marriage, according to French Law). No such religious marriage is registered in the Parish registers of Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge, but a mere private blessing eight months after the death of her husband given by Father Marcelino Carrera was registered: &quot;The private blessing uniting before God Charles Theodore Count of Flanders and Louise Marie Jacqueline Peyrebrune was given at Saint Peter&#x27;s at the altar of the Sacred Heart on 14 September 1977. The mutual consent was received by your humble brother in Christ (Fr. Carrera) in the presence of Father Keller and witnesses (Comtesse Annie de Bergeret and Mme. Marie Jeannette Aurelie Menahes). The statement is also signed by the participants and witnesses.&quot; This was confirmed by private correspondence of Jacqueline Peyrebrune. She published her memoirs in two books: &quot;Love in Shadow - The Secret Garden of Prince Charles of Belgium&quot; (Editions Tarmeye, 1991) and &quot;Carnets Intimes&quot; (Editions Tarmeye, 1993).

<text>The climatic snow line is the boundary between a snow-covered and snow-free surface. The actual snow line may adjust seasonally, and be either significantly higher in elevation, or lower. The permanent snow line is the level above which snow will lie all year.

==Background==
Snow line is an umbrella term for different interpretations of the boundary between snow-covered surface and snow-free surface. The definitions of the snow line may have different temporal and spatial focus. In many regions the changing snow line reflect seasonal dynamics. The final height of the snow line in a mountain environment at the end of the melting season is subject to climatic variability, and therefore may be different from year to year. The snow line is measured using automatic cameras, aerial photographs, or satellite images. Because the snow line can be established without on-the-ground measurements, it can be measured in remote and difficult to access areas. Therefore, the snow line has become an important variable in hydrological models.

The average elevation of a transient snow line is called the &quot;climatic snow line&quot; and is used as a parameter to classify regions according to climatic conditions. The boundary between the accumulation zone and the ablation zone on glaciers is called the &quot;annual snow line&quot;. The glacier region below this snow line was subject to melting in the previous season. The term &quot;orographic snow line&quot; is used to describe the snow boundary on surfaces other than glaciers. The term &quot;regional snow line&quot; is used to describe large areas. The &quot;permanent snow line&quot; is the level above which snow will lie all year.

==Snow lines of global regions==
The interplay of elevation and latitude affects the precise placement of the snow line at a particular location. At or near the equator, it is typically situated at approximately above sea level. As one moves towards the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, the parameter at first increases: in the Himalayas the permanent snow line can be as high as . Beyond the Tropics, the snow line becomes progressively lower as the latitude increases, to just below in the Alps and falling all the way to sea level itself at the ice caps near the poles.

In addition, the relative location to the nearest coastline can influence the elevation of the snow line. Areas near a coast might have a lower snow line than areas of the same elevation and latitude situated in a landmass interior due to more winter snowfall and because the average summer temperature of the surrounding lowlands would be warmer away from the sea. (This applies even in the tropics, since areas far from the sea will have larger diurnal temperature ranges and potentially less moisture, as observed with Kilimanjaro and presently glacier-free Mount Meru.) A higher elevation is therefore necessary to lower the temperature further against the surroundings and keep the snow from melting.

Furthermore, large-scale oceanic currents such as the North Atlantic Current can have significant effects over large areas (in this case warming northern Europe, extending even to some Arctic Ocean regions).

In the Northern Hemisphere the snow line on the north-facing slopes is at a lower elevation, as the north-facing slopes receive less sunlight (solar irradiance) than south-facing slopes. The converse will occur in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Glacier equilibrium line==
The glacier equilibrium line is the point of transition between the accumulation zone and ablation zone. It is the line where the mass of these two zones is equal. Depending on the thickness of the glacier, this line can seem as though it is leaning more towards one zone but it is determined by the actual mass of ice in either zone. The rates of ablation and accumulation can also be used to determine the location of this line.

This point is an important location to use in determining whether a glacier is growing or shrinking. A higher glacier equilibrium line will indicate that the glacier is shrinking, whereas a lower line will indicate that the glacier is growing. The terminus of a glacier advances or retreats based on the location of this equilibrium line.

Scientists are using remote sensing to better estimate the locations of this line on glaciers around the world. Using satellite imagery, scientists are able to identify whether the glacier is growing or receding. This is a very helpful tool for analyzing glaciers that are difficult to access. Using this technology we can better gauge the effects of climate change on glaciers around the world.

==Records==
The highest mountain in the world below the snow line is Ojos del Salado.

<doc id="939606" wikidata="Q78553" url="?curid=939606" title="Ignaz von Born">
<text>Ignaz [[Edler]] von Born, also known as Ignatius von Born (, , ) (26 December 1742 in Alba Iulia, Grand Principality of Transylvania, Habsburg monarchy – 24 July 1791 in Vienna), was a mineralogist and metallurgist. He was a prominent freemason, being head of Vienna&#x27;s lodge and an influential anti-clerical writer. He was the leading scientist in the Holy Roman Empire during the 1770s in the Age of Enlightenment.

His interests include mining, mineralogy, palaeontology, chemistry, metallurgy and malacology.

== Biography ==
Born belonged to a noble family of Transylvanian Saxon origin. He started school in his hometown, then was educated in a Jesuit college in Vienna, but left the Jesuits after sixteen months to study law at Prague University. He then travelled extensively to present-day Germany, the Netherlands, and France, studying mineralogy, and on his return to Prague in 1770 entered the department of mines and the mint.

In 1776 he was appointed by Maria Theresa to arrange the imperial museum at Vienna (, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Naturhistorisches Museum), where he was nominated to the council of mines and the mint, and continued to reside until his death.

He introduced a method of extracting metals by amalgamation (&quot;Uber des Anquicken der Erze&quot;, 1786), and other improvements in mining and other technical processes. His publications also include &quot;Lithophylacium Bornianum&quot; (1772–1775) and &quot;Bergbaukunde&quot; (1789), besides several museum catalogues.

Born attempted satire with no great success. &quot;Die Staatsperücke&quot;, a tale published without his knowledge in 1772. He criticised state bureaucracy in this work. And an attack on Father Hell, the Jesuit, and king&#x27;s astronomer at Vienna, are two of his satirical works. Part of a satire, entitled &quot;Monachologia&quot;, in which the monks are described in the technical language of natural history, is also ascribed to him.

Born was well acquainted with Latin and the principal modern languages of Europe, and with many branches of science not immediately connected with metallurgy and mineralogy. He took an active part in the political changes in Hungary. After the death of the emperor Joseph II, the diet of the states of Hungary rescinded many innovations of that ruler, and conferred the rights of denizen on several persons who had been favourable to the cause of the Hungarians, and, amongst others, on Born.

In 1771 Born was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and in 1774 a Fellow of the Royal Society

In 1781 Born proposed that Austria undertake a scientific voyage round the world, emulating those of Cook. The expedition was described in the press in the following terms:
Vienna, 20 July 1782. His Majesty the Emperor has ordered Councillor von Born, one of our Monarchy&#x27;s most learned savants, to put forward two subjects experienced in Natural History, to send to America in order to make new discoveries there. Mr. Heidinger, Adjunct in the Imperial Natural History Cabinet, and Doctor Maerter, Lecturer in Natural History at the Theresianum, were presented and approved; also, a Gardener and a Painter were included with them. They will go by Cape Horn to Otaheiti, from thence to Sandwich Island, to the American Coast on the North side of California, and finally to China. They both have knowledge of all areas of Natural History; it can therefore be assured that their discoveries will be of much greater ambit and usefulness than all that have been made hitherto, since Banks, Solander, and Forster looked at few other Objects of Natural History than Botany. At the end of August, they will sail on the Ship &quot;Comte de Cobenzell&quot;.
Born himself hoped to lead the expedition, but the poor state of his health meant that he had to relinquish the post of leader in favour of Franz Josef Maerter, who was accompanied by Franz Boos. Subsequently, in July 1789, Born recommended Thaddaeus Haenke to the Spanish Government for appointment as botanist on the Malaspina expedition.

In 1790, he catalogued the mineral collection of Éléonore de Raab, and this work formed the basis of William Babington&#x27;s 1799 work &quot;A New System of Mineralogy, in the form of a Catalogue, after the manner of Baron Born&#x27;s Systematic Catalogue of the collection of fossils of Mlle Éléonore de Raab&quot;.

At the time of his death in 1791, he was writing &quot;Fasti Leopoldini&quot;, probably relating to the prudent conduct of Leopold II, the successor of Joseph, towards the Hungarians.

As an active freemason in the &quot;Benevolence&quot; lodge, he introduced and tutored Mozart into the lodge. Born&#x27;s essay &quot;Über die Mysterien der Ägypter &quot; (The Mysteries of the Egyptians), published in 1784 in the freemason periodical &quot;Journal für Freymaurer&quot;, was one of the sources for the libretto for The Magic Flute written for Mozart by Emanuel Schikaneder. Born was also the regional head of the Viennese Illuminati lodge, and was a sympathiser with the Enlightenment ideas of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. He published an anticlerical satire called &quot;Monachologien&quot; in 1783, in which he depicts monks as being of a distinct race that is a mixture between ape and man.

The mineral bornite (Cu5FeS4), a common copper ore mineral was named in his honour.

<text>The Kenogami River is a river in the James Bay drainage basin in Thunder Bay and Cochrane districts in Northern Ontario, Canada, which flows north from Long Lake near Longlac to empty into the Albany River. The river is in length and its name means &quot;long water&quot; in the Cree language. A portion of the river&#x27;s headwaters have been diverted into the Lake Superior drainage basin.

==Course==

The river begins at Longlac Bay on Long Lake at the community of Longlac, part of the municipality of Greenstone, Thunder Bay District. It passes under Ontario Highway 11 and the Canadian National Railway (CNR) transcontinental main line (used at this point by Via Rail transcontinental &quot;Canadian&quot; trains) into geographic Bain Township in Unorganized Thunder Bay District, takes in the left tributaries Kenogamisis River and Burrows River, and reaches the Kenogami Lake Dam.

It continues northeast, takes in the left tributary Kawakanika River, reaches Chipman Lake, passes into Cochrane District at geographic Chipman Township, takes in the right tributaries Fernow River and Wabigano River, heads under a CNR line abandoned in 1986 (originally the National Transcontinental Railway main line) between the railway points Ogahalla to the west and Blanche to the east, and reaches the confluence with the left tributary Atikasibi River.

The river continues northeast, takes in the Mundino River (left), Flint River (right), Watistiguam River (left) and Nemasa River (left), the last at Loon Island, the right tributary Pagwachuan River, and then, within two kilometres, the right tributaries Nagagami River and Kabinakagami River, the latter at the unincorporated place and community of Mammamattawa, site of the abandoned Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company English River Post trading post.

It turns north, passes the English River 66 First Nations Reserve (part of the Constance Lake First Nation lands), takes in the left tributaries Little Ash River, Ash River and Kingfisher River, the right tributary Wakashi River, the left tributaries Little Drowning River, Drowning River and Little Current River, and reaches its mouth at The Albany Forks on the Albany River, which flows to James Bay.

==History==
The first inland post of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, named Henley House, was established at the confluence of the Kenogami River and Albany River in 1743. A new post was established in 1884 at Mammamattawa, Ontario at the confluence of the Kenogami River and the Kabinakagami River. It was known as the English River Post, as the Kenogami was also known as the English River.

==Long Lake diversion project==
In 1937–38, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, now Ontario Power Generation, built the Kenogami Lake Dam () and Long Lake Diversion Dam to divert this river&#x27;s headwaters to empty through Long Lake and the Aguasabon River into Lake Superior. The former backed up the headwaters, while the latter controlled the outflow into the Aguasabon River. The diversion has shifted an average flow of per second from a drainage basin of almost from James Bay to the Great Lakes Basin. Initially, the diversion supported forestry development and hydroelectric development further downstream on the Great Lakes at Niagara Falls; no hydroelectric development on the watercourses on the diversion project was practical initially. A further stage was completed in 1948 when the Hayes Lake Dam (for water control) and Aguasabon Generating Station (for hydroelectricity), the former just upstream of the latter and the latter just upstream of the mouth of the Aguasabon River at Lake Superior, to support a pulp and paper mill at the adjacent town of Terrace Bay.

<doc id="939615" wikidata="Q130345" url="?curid=939615" title="John Bachman">
<text>John Bachman ( ; February 4, 1790 – February 24, 1874) was an American Lutheran minister, social activist and naturalist who collaborated with John James Audubon to produce &quot;Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America&quot; and whose writings, particularly &quot;Unity of the Human Race&quot;, were influential in the development of the theory of evolution. He was married to the painter Maria Martin. Several species of animals are named in his honor.

==Life==

Bachman served the same Charleston, South Carolina church as pastor for 56 years but still found time to conduct natural history studies that caught the attention of noted bird artist John James Audubon and eminent scientists in England, Europe, and beyond. He was a proponent of secular and religious education and helped found Newberry College and the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, as well as the South Carolina Lutheran Synod.

He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1845.

Bachman was a social reformer who ministered to African-American slaves as well as white Southerners, and who used his knowledge of natural history to become one of the first writers to argue scientifically that blacks and whites are the same species. His accomplishments span a lifetime punctuated by the unrest of the American Civil War—a conflict that caused him great consternation and may have brought about his premature death due to injuries suffered at the hands of Union soldiers.

==Legacy==
Bachman&#x27;s hare, Bachman&#x27;s sparrow, and Bachman&#x27;s warbler are named in his honor. The latter, now declared extinct, was recorded in 1832 by Bachman, who presented study skins and descriptions to his friend and collaborator, John James Audubon. Audubon never saw the bird alive but named it in honor of Bachman. In 1816, Bachman recorded the marsh rice rat.

Despite his achievements, Bachman is usually overlooked in accounts of important figures from the 19th century, and he is seldom mentioned in history courses, even in South Carolina schools. To improve public understanding of John Bachman&#x27;s accomplishments, the Newberry College Alumni Association held a major international John Bachman Symposium in April 2006, the beginning of the college&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration. &quot;Nature, God, and Social Reform in the Old South: The Life and Work of the Rev. John Bachman&quot; was attended by academics, students, and the general public.

==Commentary on Bachman==
An 1854 article &quot;The Southern Apostasy&quot;, in &quot;The New Englander&quot;, declares the following: &quot;The Rev. Dr. Bachman, Pastor of a Lutheran Congregation in Charleston, is a man of eminent attainments in science, and particularly in the department of Natural History. ... Observe then how he exhibits the bearing of his subject on the &quot;peculiar institutions&quot; of the Southern States:&quot;

... That the negro will remain as he is, unless his form is changed by an amalgamation, which latter is revolting to us. That his intellect, although underrated, is greatly inferior to that of the Caucasian, and that he is, therefore, as far as our experience goes, incapable of self-government. That he is thrown on our protection. That our defense of slavery is contained in the Holy Scriptures. That the Scriptures teach the rights and duties of masters to rule their servants with justice and kindness, and enjoin the obedience of servants.

Leonard Woolsey Bacon writes in &quot;A History of American Christianity&quot;:

The eminent leader among the Lutheran clergy, the Rev. Dr. Bachman, of Charleston, referred &quot;that unexampled unanimity of sentiment that now exists in the whole South on the subject of slavery&quot; to the confidence felt by the religious public in the Bible defense of slavery as set forth by clergymen and laymen in sermons and pamphlets and speeches in Congress.

In a footnote in the second edition of &quot;The Races of Men&quot;, Robert Knox wrote as follows:

I have read with horror the ravings of Mr. John Bachman, a slave-owning parson. The expression &quot;whited sepulchre&quot; must have been invented for the class to which he belongs. They are very numerous in England.

<text>The HAL Dhruv () is a utility helicopter designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in November 1984. The helicopter first flew in 1992; its development was prolonged due to multiple factors including the Indian Army&#x27;s requirement for design changes, budget restrictions, and sanctions placed on India following the 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests. Dhruv entered service in 2002. It is designed to meet the requirement of both military and civil operators, with military variants of the helicopter being developed for the Indian Armed Forces, while a variant for civilian/commercial use has also been developed. Military versions in production include transport, utility, reconnaissance and medical evacuation variants.

As of January 2024, more than 400 Dhruvs had been produced for domestic and export markets logging more than 340,000 flying hours.

==Development==

===Origins===
The &quot;Advanced Light Helicopter&quot; (ALH) program for an indigenous 5-ton multirole helicopter was initiated in May 1979 by the Indian Air Force and Indian Naval Air Arm. HAL were given a contract by the Indian government in 1984 to develop the helicopter; Germany&#x27;s Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) were contracted in July 1984 as a design consultant and collaborative partner on the programme. Although originally scheduled to fly in 1989, the first prototype ALH (Z-3182) made its maiden flight on 20 August 1992 at Bangalore with the then-Indian Vice President K R Narayanan in attendance. This was followed by a second prototype (Z-3183) on 18 April 1993, an Army/Air Force version (Z-3268), and a navalised prototype (IN.901) with Allied Signal CTS800 engines and a retractable tricycle undercarriage. Development problems arose due to changing military demands and a funding shortfall in the wake of the 1991 Indian economic crisis.

Naval testing on board and other ships started in March 1998, and around the same time a weight-reduction programme was initiated. However, further delays in development were caused when sanctions were implemented against India following a number of Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998 and India&#x27;s continued refusal to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. As a result, the intended engine for the helicopter, the LHTEC T800, was embargoed. The Turbomeca TM 333-2B2 turboshaft engine was selected as a replacement; in addition, Turbomeca agreed to co-develop a more powerful engine with HAL, originally known as the &quot;Ardiden&quot;. Turbomeca also assisted in the development of the helicopter; stress analysis and studies of rotor dynamics were conducted in France. The first flight of Dhruv with the new engine variant, called the &quot;Shakti&quot;, took place on 16 August 2007.

===Further development===

The HAL Rudra, earlier known as Dhruv-WSI (&quot;Weapons Systems Integrated&quot;), is an attack variant designed for the Indian Army. Development was sanctioned in December 1998 and the prototype first flew on 16 August 2007; it is to be armed with both anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, and a 20-mm turret-mounted cannon. The Dhruv-WSI is to be capable of conducting combat air support (CAS) and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) roles as well. In addition to the Dhruv-WSI, HAL is also developing the light combat helicopter (LCH) based on the Dhruv for the Indian Armed Forces. It is fitted with stub wings for carrying up to eight anti-armour missiles, four air-to-air missiles, or four pods loaded with either 70 mm or 68 mm rockets. The LCH will also have forward-looking infrared (FLIR), a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and a target acquisition system with laser rangefinder and thermal vision.

In 2005, following a crash landing of a Dhruv, the entire fleet was grounded when it was discovered to have been caused by excessive vibration of the tail rotor. Following a redesign which incorporated new materials in addition to changes in design methodology, the Dhruv undertook recertification and returned to service shortly after March 2006. In April 2007, a report published by the Indian Committee of Defence noted the Dhruv as one of four &quot;focus areas&quot; identified as having high export potential. In January 2011, HAL and partner Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) announced that they were jointly developing the Dhruv to operate as an unmanned maritime helicopter, stating customer interest in such a feature.

The first five production Dhruv Mk III, powered by the more powerful Shakti-1H engine, were delivered to the Leh-based 205 Aviation Squadron on 7 February 2011 during a ceremony at HAL&#x27;s Helicopter Division. In July 2011, India&#x27;s Directorate General of Civil Aviation certified a Dhruv simulator developed by HAL and Canadian developer CAE Inc; the simulator is easily modifiable to simulate different variants of the Dhruv and other helicopters such as the Eurocopter Dauphin. Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) has been developing an oxygen life-support system to improve the helicopter&#x27;s high-altitude performance, and as of August 2010 the IAF has ordered development of this system for the Dhruv.

==Design==
The HAL Dhruv is of conventional design; about 29 percent of its empty weight (constituting 60 percent of the airframe&#x27;s surface area) is composite materials. It has been reported that the unique carbon fibre composite developed by HAL reduced the helicopter&#x27;s weight by 50 percent. The high tail boom allows easy access to the rear doors. The twin 1000 shp Turbomeca TM333-2B2 turboshafts are mounted above the cabin and drive a four-blade composite main rotor. The main rotor can be manually folded; the blades are mounted between carbon-fibre-reinforced plates, the rotor head is constructed from fibre elastomers. In February 2004, US helicopter company Lord Corporation were awarded a contract to develop an active vibration control system (AVCS), which monitors onboard conditions and cancels out fuselage vibrations.

The cockpit section of the fuselage is of Kevlar and carbon-fibre construction; it is also fitted with crumple zones and crashworthy seats. The aircraft is equipped with a SFIM Inc four-axis automatic flight control system. Avionics systems include a HF/UHF communications radio, IFF recognition, Doppler navigation, and a radio altimeter; a weather radar and the Omega navigation system were options for the naval variant. IAI has also developed targeting systems and an electronic warfare suite for the Dhruv, as well as avionics for day-and-night flight observation. HAL&#x27;s claim that the Dhruv is indigenous has been challenged by 5h3 Comptroller and Auditor General of India, who reported that as of August 2010 the helicopter was: &quot;...against the envisaged indigenisation level of 50% (by 2008), 90% of the value of material used in each ALH is still imported from foreign suppliers&quot;.
In September 2010, it was reported that the Dhruv&#x27;s Integrated Dynamic System (IDS), which combines several key rotor control functions into a single module carrying the engine&#x27;s power to the rotors, was suffering from excessive wear, necessitating frequent replacement; as a consequence the cruising speed had been restricted to 250 km/h and high-altitude performance was lessened as well. HAL contracted Italian aerospace firm Avio for consultancy purposes and they subsequently replicated production of the IDS in Italy in order to isolate the problem with the early testing of the Dhruv subsequently being criticized as &quot;rushed&quot;. In June 2011, HAL has reported that the issue had been resolved and not present in the Dhruv Mk III; a number of alterations both to the design and production had been made to improve the IDS. A programme of retrofitting the Mk I and Mk II was completed by June 2011.

The ALH Mk-III with new Shakti-1H engines has better and improved high altitude performance operating at altitudes over 6 km. It comes with seating for 14 fully equipped troops. DGCA has reportedly praised its crashworthy design as a few accidents have not caused any fatalities.

In September 2024, HAL assigned TimeTooth Technologies, based in Bengaluru, for indigenisation of Rotor Damp System to be used on ALH Dhruv and HAL Prachand. The project involves development and qualification of the system for the next two years followed by its production and supply would be for a period of 5 years and beyond. The majority of the project will be funded by the private company itself. The production order value is expected to exceed $5 million within the 5-year period.

==Operational history==

===India===
Deliveries of the Dhruv commenced in January 2002, nine years after the prototype&#x27;s first flight, and nearly eighteen years after the program was initiated.

The Indian Coast Guard was the first service to operate the Dhruv; this was followed by the Indian Army, Indian Navy, Indian Air Force and the Border Security Force. 75 Dhruvs were delivered to the Indian armed forces by 2007, and as of 2008 it was planned to produce 40 helicopters annually. The Indian Air Force&#x27;s Sarang aerobatic display team performs using 4 Dhruv helicopters. On 23 December 2007, a further order of 159 helicopters, worth , for the Indian Army and Air Force was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS). By 2007, Indian Air Force operationalised two ALH squadrons in Yelehanka AFS in Bengaluru and Sarsawa AFS.The Dhruv is capable of flying at high altitudes, as it was an Army requirement for the helicopter to be able operate in the Siachen Glacier and Kashmir regions. In September 2007, the Dhruv Mk.3 was cleared for high-altitude flying in the Siachen Sector after six months of trials. In October 2007, a Dhruv Mk.3 flew to an altitude of ASL in Siachen. An Indian Army report in 2009 criticised the Dhruv&#x27;s performance, stating: &quot;The ALH was not able to fly above 5,000m, though the army&#x27;s requirements stipulated an ability to fly up to 6,500m&quot;; this has been blamed on the TM333 engine. As a consequence the Army had to continue relying on the older Cheetah/Cheetal helicopters to meet the shortfall. The more powerful Shakti-1H engine has since been introduced on the Dhruv Mk.3; on one test it carried 600 kg load to Sonam Post against the Army&#x27;s requirement of 200 kg. The Indian Army received the first batch of Dhruv Mk.3s during Aero India 2011.
In October 2008, Defence Minister A. K. Antony announced that the Indian Navy will deploy the Dhruv in the utility role. The proposed anti-submarine warfare (ASW) variant had been deemed unsuitable by the Navy, which was reportedly dissatisfied with the folding blade performance and maintenance record. In 2015, HAL modified the foldable rotor&#x27;s design to allow the Dhruv to be carried on board light frigates; several Indian Navy helicopters shall receive this modification. The Navy has considered the Dhruv for maritime surveillance and search and rescue roles, and in 2008 a senior Navy official said: &quot;The ALH has a long way to go before the programme matures sufficiently for it to undertake basic naval roles such as search and rescue (SAR) and communication duties.&quot; In 2013, the Indian Navy was reportedly interested in the HAL Rudra, the armed version of the Dhruv. On 12 November 2013, the Indian Navy commissioned their first Dhruv squadron (INAS 322, Guardians); Vice Admiral Sinha stated that &quot;In the Navy, Dhruv helicopters had transformed into an advanced search and rescue (SAR) helicopter, which is also used for missions like heliborne operations, and armed patrol with night vision devices&quot;.

Civil Dhruv variants are produced for transport, rescue, policing, offshore operations, air-ambulance, and other roles. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation are to use the Dhruv for offshore operations. Several Indian state governments are to use Dhruvs for police and transportation duties. In March 2011, India&#x27;s Directorate General of Civil Aviation released a proposed airworthiness directive asking all civilian Dhruv operators to temporarily ground their aircraft due to cracks potentially forming in the tail area, and recommended reinforcing affected areas.

Following the 2011 Sikkim earthquake, four Dhruvs conducted rescue operations. In October 2011, Jharkhand&#x27;s regional government appealed for Mil Mi-17 helicopters as operations of their Dhruvs had been disrupted by prolonged maintenance delays and a major crash. In October 2011, The Telegraph reported that a spate of helicopter crashes, including the Dhruv, were alleged to have been caused by low quality maintenance work performed by Pawan Hans Helicopters Ltd.

In February 2012, the Home Ministry reported that the Dhruv remained grounded and that other helicopters such as the Mi-17 were being wet-leased in its place and that in the long term the Dhruv fleet is to be replaced. In February 2012, HAL reported that the Indian Army and Air Force had ordered a further 159 units of Dhruv helicopters.

Six Army Dhruvs along with 18 Air Force Dhruvs were used during rescue operations after the 2013 North India floods. Their compact size, agility, ability to carry up to 16 people to heights of 10,000 feet, and to evacuate stranded people from inaccessible regions was praised. The Dhruv could carry more people from high-altitude helipads than the heavier Mi-17, and land where the lighter Bell 407 could not. Total flight time during Operation Rahat and Operation Surya Hope was 630 hours, of which 550 hours were dedicated to SAR missions.

In January 2014, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) inducted a Dhruv equipped with a heliborne geophysical survey system (HGSS). Costing , the HGSS can conduct magnetic, spectrometric and gravity surveys. In May 2018, Israel Aerospace Industries was awarded a contract to upgrade cockpits of 150 Dhruv helicopters, in addition to 50 that had been contracted earlier.

On February 5, 2021, the Indian Navy tweeted that it has received the Advanced Light Helicopter MK III (MR) alongside the Indian Coast Guard. In February 2021, HAL announced that it had rolled out the 300th Advance Light Helicopter out of its production line in Bangalore.

As of September 2024, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) chose HAL Dhruv for its operations to fly out personnel and equipment from offshore oil rigs. The helicopters will be operated by Pawan Hans. Dhruv won the competition after a competitive bidding with foreign bidders.

The Dhruv has become the first major Indian weapons system to have secured large foreign sales. In 2004, HAL stated that it hoped to sell 120 Dhruvs over the next eight years, and has been displaying the Dhruv at air shows, including Farnborough and Paris in order to market the Dhruv. HAL had entered into a partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to develop and promote the Dhruv, IAI has also helped develop new avionics and a glass cockpit for newer variants of the Dhruv.

With a unit price at least 15 percent less than its rivals, the Dhruv has elicited interest in many countries, mostly from Latin America, Africa, West Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific Rim nations. Air forces from around 35 countries have made inquiries, along with requests for demonstrations. Flight certification for Europe and North America is also being planned in order to tap the large civilian market there.

Russia: In July 2006, the then Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Shashindra Pal Tyagi commented that India could purchase as many as 80 Mi-17 helicopters if Russia in turn bought Dhruv helicopters in exchange.

South America: HAL has reportedly been negotiating with Bolivia for five Dhruvs; and with Venezuela for up to seven.

Southeast Asia: The Dhruv has also been offered to Malaysia, while it is also being evaluated by the Indonesian Army.

Philippines: The HAL Annual Report for 2020-21, indicated that the Philippine Coast Guard is interested to potentially buy 7 Dhruvs via Indian-based credit. It is reported that the PCG is looking at the Dhruv ALH. There has been to instances when the capabilities of Dhruv were demonstrated to Philippines. First was when PCG chief visited Indian Coast Guard facility at Goa in 2023 and took part in a &quot;Customer Demonstration Flight&quot; and second was when a three ship flotilla (including , and ) visited Manila, Philippines in May 2024.

Egypt: Egypt stated in 2022 that it was interested in acquiring the ALH.

Argentina: The Argentinian Ministry of Defense signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to procure the Dhruv for the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic on July 20, 2023.

=== Failed bids ===
Chile: The Dhruv participated in a Chilean tender for eight to ten twin-engined helicopters, conducting a series of evaluation flights to demonstrate the capabilities of its avionics and flight performance; however, it lost out to the Bell 412, although there were media accusations of unfair pressure being exercised by the US Government to favour Bell.

==== Ecuador ====
HAL has secured an order from the Ecuadorian Air Force (EAF) for seven Dhruvs, amidst strong competition from Elbit, Eurocopter and Kazan. HAL&#x27;s offer of 50.7 million was about 32 percent lower than the second lowest bid from Elbit. Five helicopters were delivered in February 2009, during Aero India 2009. Both the Ecuadorian Army and Ecuadorian Navy have since expressed interest in the Dhruvs. The Dhruv has been involved in search and rescue, transport, and MEDEVAC missions in the north of the country.

Following the crash of one of the Dhruvs in October 2009, Ecuador reportedly considered returning their six helicopters to HAL amid claims of being unfit for service; EAF commander Genl. Rodrigo Bohorquez stated &quot;If it is a major problem that can&#x27;t be easily remedied, we would have to return [the Dhruv].&quot; HAL assisted the crash investigation, which found the cause to be pilot error.

In February 2011, the EAF were reported to be satisfied with the Dhruv&#x27;s performance and was considering further orders. By October 2015, a total of four Ecuadorian Dhruvs had crashed reportedly due to mechanical equipment and Ecuador grounded the type. In October 2015 Ecuador cancelled the contract and withdrew the surviving helicopters from service, non-delivery of parts and high accident rate were cited. In 2016, the Ecuadorian Minister of Defense Ricardo Patiño announced that the remainder of the HAL Dhruv helicopters of the Ecuadorian Air Force, which are stored at the Guayaquil Air Base are for sale and that the Air Force is looking for potential buyers. The Government of Ecuador had unilaterally terminated the contract with HAL citing safety concerns of the helicopters. A HAL spokesman said that while maintenance was supposed to be done by the EAF due to the warranty period being expired, the company was willing to assist them to make sure that the Dhruvs were operational. Quito declined further assistance.

==== Utility Helicopter-Marine ====
HAL is currently developing an advanced variant of the ALH Dhruv to address the specific needs of the Indian Navy. The helicopter is to be purpose-built for ship-borne uses.

The UH-M programme has its origin from the Navy&#x27;s Naval Utility Helicopter (NUH) acquisition programme. The Navy issued a requirement of 111 units of utility helicopters. The programme was cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) – the main acquisition panel under the Ministry of Defence (MoD) headed by the then Minister of Defence Nirmala Sitharaman on 25 August 2018 though the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) document. The cost of the programme was set at . The requirement would be fulfilled through the Strategic Partnership (SP) model including an Indian and a foreign Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) under the Make in India initiative.

According to a report in April 2022, the Expression of Interest (EoI) to OEMs and Strategic Partners were issued in February 2019. However, the deal was included in the third &quot;positive indigenisation list&quot;. Meanwhile, HAL had carried out a joint study of ALH Dhruv to increase the MTOW to 5.7 tonnes, reduce the empty weight and increase the overall payload capacity to 600 kg. The modifications also included &quot;reduced stowage dimensions to meet requirement with foldable two segment blades and modified upper control system and Aircraft Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) traversing interface for ship deck.&quot; The programme is to replace the Navy&#x27;s ageing Chetak fleet. The Indian Navy is to place an order of at least 50 helicopters in the first phase.

The maritime wheeled version of Dhruv having segmented Main Rotor Blades (MRBs) and Main Rotor Head (MRH) in pre-cone configuration completed its first flight on 30 June 2022. By March 2023, tail boom folding has been demonstrated. Reportedly, the UH-M will also showcase anti-ship missile and torpedo firing capability.

On 16 March 2023, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approved the Utility Helicopter-Maritime programme for the Indian Navy.

On 20 October 2024, a report from The Economic Times revealed that the prototype of Utility Helicopters-Marine (UH-M) helicopter is under construction while the first flight is expected by May 2025. Its multirole capabilities will include transportation of personnel, cargo delivery and CASEVAC. Simultaneously, the new technologies developed for the new helicopter is also being tested on a testbed. The design is mostly based on the earlier Dhruv and includes extensive modifications to fit inside a ship-based hangar. The modifications includes foldable tail boom as well as foldable rotor blades and a nose-mounted surveillance radar. The Navy needs 111 of these helicopters.

Raj Shukla and Indian Air Force South Western Air Command Chief Air Marshal S.K. Ghotia and 4 other officers were onboard. Everyone survived as a precautionary landing was conducyed 30km away from Ahmedabad.
*3 August 2021: an Army Rudra helicopter crashed into the water near Ranjit Sagar Dam Lake. The helicopter belonged to the Pathankot-based 254 ALH-WSI squadron and was carrying out a routine training mission involving low-level flying over the lake and had two officers — a Lt Col A S Bath and a Capt Jayant Joshi. The crash led to their death and their bodies were recovered from water after 12 and 76 days of the incident, respectively. Being an Army chopper, it lacked an emergency flotation gear (EFG). The search and rescue mission involved specialized divers and Dhruv and Cheetah helicopters and, later, a heavy-lift Chinook helicopter also joined the search.
*21 October 2022: an Army Rudra, inducted in 2015, crashed killing two pilots and three soldiers onboard. The crash occurred near the Tuting area in Arunachal Pradesh’s Upper Siang district around 10:43 am. The crash was attributed to technical issues.
=== 2023 ===

*On 8 March 2023, a MK III naval variant made an emergency water landing off the coast of Mumbai, prompting the navy to ground the aircraft pending further investigation. All three crew members were rescued. Before the crash, the crew experienced a &quot;sudden loss of power and rapid loss of height&quot;. The crash led to the grounding of the entire 330-Dhruv fleet of the Indian Armed Forces as well as the Coast Guard. A problem with control rods were identified. Only few units of the Army until April were cleared for flight before another accident took place.
*On 26 March 2023, an Indian Coast Guard ALH Dhruv Mark 3 helicopter crashed during soon after takeoff from a height of 25 ft near the main runway at Kochi Airport. Three Indian Coast Guard servicemen on board survived with minor injuries.
*On 4 May 2023, a Dhruv of the Indian Army Northern Command on an operational deployment made a hard landing on the banks of Marua river in Kishtwar region of Jammu and Kashmir at 11:15 am IST. Two pilots were injured while Craftsmen (Aviation Technician) Pabballa Anil succumbed to his injuries. A technical fault was reported by the pilots to the ATC. The incident occurred while attempting a precautionary landing. The hard landing was attributed to undulating ground, undergrowth and unprepared landing area. This marked the third accident involving Dhruv in a 2-month span. The series of accidents resulted the mean time between checks for the helicopters to be brought down from 600 hours of flight to 300 and a further plan to 100-150. On 6 May, the Army&#x27;s Dhruv fleet was again grounded as a precautionary measure because this accident was not due to control rods like the previous incidents. Only IAF and ICG had a small batch of Dhruv flying as of then while the mean time between checks was down to 100 flying hours.
The aluminium booster control rods, which were found to be the main reason of the recent accidents, are being replaced by steel ones. According to reports, the collective control rod has been replaced in the entire helicopter fleet while that of the other two rods (lateral and longitudinal) in the ALH fleet is underway, and is planned to be completed by end of June 2024.
=== 2024-25 ===
*On 2 September 2024, an Indian Coast Guard Dhruv Mk 3 (CG 863) of 835 Squadron conducted an emergency landing in the Arabian Sea at night when deployed for medical evacuation of a seriously injured crew on board Indian-flagged motor tanker Hari Leela about 45 km from Porbandar. The helicopter was launched at around 2300 hrs IST and crash landed at 2315 hrs while approaching the motor tanker ship. While, the injured crew was rescued by an ICG ship afterwards, out of the 2 pilots and 2 divers on the helicopter, one diver (diver Gautam Kumar) was rescued by a search and rescue team and the search for the others were on. The wreckage was also found. For search and rescue team included a total four ships and two aircraft of the ICG and 2 specialised ships and diving ships of the Navy were deployed. The same helicopter had rescued 67 people during the recent cyclonic weather in Gujarat. Later, 2 missing personnel&#x27;s body was recovered. They were later known to be pilot Vipin Babu and diver Karan Singh. For the incident, ICG grounded the Dhruv fleet for inspection. As of 6 September, the search for the captain is on along with the process of salvaging the helicopter. The average depth of search and rescue ops is 55 m. On 10 October, the remains of Commandant Rakesh Kumar Rana, the captain of the helicopter was located and recovered about 55 km from southwest of Porbandar after a total of more than 70 air sorties and 82 ship days of search efforts by the ICG and the Indian Navy. He was cremated with full military honours the next day. This culminated the massive search operation.
*On 2 October 2024, an Indian Air Force ALH air-dropping relief material in flood-hit Bihar made a forced landing in a swamp following engine failure. All 4 crew were rescued.
*On 5 January 2025, a Dhruv of the ICG crashed in an open field near CGAE Porbandar, Gujarat and burst into flames. All three of the crew members (2 pilots, 1 aircrew diver) were reported dead. An inquiry has been launched to judge the reason of the crash which is the third incident for the type in four months. According to a report, the helicopter in question was inducted into service on June 2021 and &quot;had completed one 90-minute training sortie, with the crew undertaking running change for the next sortie. While hovering at around 200-feet, the ALH then crashed nose down and burst into flames&quot;. The FDR (flight data recorder) and CVR (cockpit voice recorder) of the chopper is being analysed under HAL and ICG&#x27;s independent investigations while the country-wide Dhruv fleet has been re-grounded. It was found that the helicopter did not respond to pilot&#x27;s command for 3-4 seconds before crashing. Entire civilian fleet was also asked to be grounded by HAL on 11 January. By 4 February, it was confirmed by CSIR-NAL that a component of the transmission system (likely, swashplate) had malfunctioned making the aircraft unresponsive. This is the first instance of such failure. A defect investigation committee (DIC), including members from CEMILAC, HAL and Directorate General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DGAQA), will evaluate the origin of the issue — quality, inspection or maintenance, and submit a report within four weeks after which &quot;remedial actions&quot; would be taken. The wreckage was transported to CSIR-NAL facility for investigation.

<text>Richard Lichfield (died 1630) was a barber surgeon in Cambridge, England, during the late 16th and early 17th century. In 1597 he wrote a pamphlet sharply criticising the writer Thomas Nashe, which for many years was believed to be the work of Gabriel Harvey.

Although not a member of the academic community Lichfield belonged to the property-owning middle class, and had a local reputation as a humorist. His humour took the form of parodies of learned speeches, complete with phony Latinisms, evidently a popular genre at Cambridge and one in which other barbers are also said to have excelled.

Nashe&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Have with You to Saffron-Walden&quot; (1596) had been dedicated to Lichfield in a provocative and slyly insolent way. After a brief delay, Lichfield answered it with &quot;The Trimming of Thomas Nashe, Gentleman&quot;, (1597). For many years it was assumed that Harvey himself had adopted the persona of Lichfield and written the reply to Nashe, but the style of the pamphlet is nothing like his and appears quite genuinely to be by Lichfield, and is generally so accepted today. Certainly when Nashe light-heartedly threatened a demolition of the work in &quot;Nashes Lenten Stuffe&quot;- &quot;...stay till Ester Terme, and then, with the answere to the &quot;Trim Tram&quot;, I will make you laugh your hearts out&quot; - he does not suggest it is Harvey&#x27;s.

Lichfield&#x27;s pamphlet is interesting to literary historians because it gives some biographical details on Nashe which would otherwise not be known, and makes a glancing reference to the rising Cambridge satirist, Joseph Hall.

<text>Trent Park is an English country house in north London, accompanied by its former extensive grounds. The original great house, along with several statues and other structures within the grounds, such as the Orangery, are Grade II listed buildings. The site is designated as Metropolitan Green Belt, lies within a conservation area, and is also included at Grade II within the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.

Until 2012, the house and adjacent buildings constituted the Trent Park campus of Middlesex University. The campus hosted the performing arts, teacher education, humanities, product design and engineering, television production, and biological science departments, as well as the Flood Hazard Research Centre. The campus was vacated in October 2012.

The parkland extends to approximately and has been known as the Trent Country Park since 1973. The park includes a sports ground, Southgate Hockey Centre. Previously, there was an indoor tennis court that was attended by royalty. This later became a sports hall when the building was converted into a college of education.

The Trent Park site was purchased by a developer who received the necessary permits in October 2017 to construct 262 residential units. The site will also include a museum on the two lower floors of the mansion. While the university campus buildings were removed, the historic buildings, gardens and landscape were retained.

==History==
Trent Park dates back to the fourteenth century when it was a part of Enfield Chase, one of Henry IV&#x27;s hunting grounds. In 1777 George III leased the site to Sir Richard Jebb, his favourite doctor, as a reward for saving the life of the King&#x27;s younger brother, the then Duke of Gloucester. Jebb chose the name Trent, because it was in Trent, Italy, that the King&#x27;s brother had been saved. Jebb subsequently acquired the freehold interest in the house and on his death it was sold to Lord Cholmondeley.

In about 1836 the house was bought by the banker David Bevan for his son Robert Cooper Lee Bevan on his marriage to Lady Agneta Yorke. Robert Bevan built Christ Church, Cockfosters in 1838 to provide a suitable place of worship for the district.

The author and researcher Nesta Webster (nee Bevan) was born at Trent Park in 1876.

In 1909 the estate was sold to Sir Edward Sassoon, father of Philip Sassoon (cousin of the poet Siegfried Sassoon). Sir Philip Sassoon inherited the estate in 1912 upon his father&#x27;s death and went on to entertain many notable guests at Trent Park, including Charlie Chaplin and Winston Churchill. 

==Trent Park House==

Sir Philip Sassoon had a reputation for being one of the greatest hosts in Britain. Herbert Baker designed one house for him in 1912, Port Lympne, later the Port Lympne Wild Animal Park, in Kent, and Philip Tilden largely rebuilt another, Trent Park, from 1923.

Stylistic differences between the two houses illustrate changes in taste among members of British high society of the period. Trent Park possessed a landscape designed by Humphry Repton but the existing house was Victorian and undistinguished. Sassoon had the Victorian additions demolished or altered, except for the west service wing, between 1926 and 1931. The projecting wings were added to the entrance (south) front. These modifications led to a large mansion in early-Georgian style. It became one of the houses of the age, &quot;a dream of another world – the white-coated footmen serving endless courses of rich but delicious food, the Duke of York coming in from golf... Winston Churchill arguing over the teacups with George Bernard Shaw, Lord Balfour dozing in an armchair, Rex Whistler absorbed in his painting... while Philip himself flitted from group to group, an alert, watchful, influential but unobtrusive stage director – all set against a background of mingled luxury, simplicity and informality, brilliantly contrived...&quot;

The atmosphere, as Clive Aslet has suggested, represented a complete about-face from Sassoon&#x27;s earlier extravagance at Port Lympne to what Aslet called &quot;an appreciation of English reserve.&quot; In the words of Christopher Hussey, at Trent, Sassoon caught &quot;that indefinable and elusive quality, the spirit of a country house... an essence of cool, flowery, chintzy, elegant, unobtrusive rooms that rises in the mind when we are thinking of country houses.&quot;

===Second World War===

Sir Philip Sassoon died in 1939 and the house was requisitioned by the government for use during World War II. Trent Park was used as a centre to extract information from captured German officers. During the Battle of Britain in 1940, captured Luftwaffe pilots were held initially at Trent Park. The rooms at Trent Park had been equipped with hidden microphones that allowed the British to listen in to the pilots&#x27; conversations. This provided information about the German pilots&#x27; views on a number of matters, including the relative strengths and weaknesses of German aircraft.

Later in the war it was used as a special prisoner-of-war camp (the &#x27;Cockfosters Cage&#x27;) for captured German generals and staff officers. They were treated hospitably, provided with special rations of whisky and allowed regular walks on the grounds. The hidden 88A pressure microphones and listening devices allowed the British military (MI19) to gather important information and an intimate insight into the minds of the German military elite. An example of the intelligence gained from Trent Park is the existence and location of the German rocket development at Peenemünde Army Research Center, when General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma discussed what he had seen there. This led to the area being attacked by Bomber Command in Operation Hydra. Intelligence was also gained on war crimes, political views, and the resistance in Germany that led to the 20 July plot against Hitler. Eighty-four generals and a number of lower-ranking staff officers were brought to Trent Park.

More than 1,300 protocols were written by the time the war ended; a selection of these was published in English in 2007 under the title &quot;Tapping Hitler&#x27;s Generals&quot;. Selected transcripts were dramatised in the 2008 History Channel 5-part series &quot;The Wehrmacht&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Crimes&quot;, General Dietrich von Choltitz is quoted as saying in October 1944,

The transcripts from Trent Park are also included in the 2011 book &quot;Soldaten – On Fighting, Killing, and Dying: The Secret Second World War Tapes of German POWs&quot; by historian Sönke Neitzel and social psychologist Harald Welzer. In its review of the book, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reports:

Franz von Werra was also interrogated at Trent Park.

===College conversion===

In 1947 the estate became a Ministry of Education emergency training college for male teachers, then in 1950 it became Trent Park Training College, a constituent college of the University of London, Institute of Education a residential, co-educational training college. During the period as a college, famous alumni included Mike Figgis ( film director), David Hepworth (writer and broadcaster) and Christopher Rogers (master brewer). In 1951 the entire estate was compulsorily purchased by Middlesex County Council as Green Belt land. In 1965 the Greater London Council took over the administration of the park and the London Borough of Enfield took over the college. Trent Country Park was opened to the public in 1973.

Trent Park Training College became part of Middlesex Polytechnic in 1974, which itself became Middlesex University in 1992. The university&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor was provided with a residence within the park. Though not so grand as the main house, this nevertheless boasted several small private gardens including a rose garden.

In the mid-1990s, Middlesex University and Southgate Sports and Leisure Trust (SSLT) reached agreement to develop the dilapidated university sports ground. In 1997–8 SSLT built a clubhouse and two artificial grass pitches on the site, which was opened in March 1998 as Southgate Hockey Centre. It is home to Southgate Hockey Club, and provides sports and social facilities to the local community. Middlesex University vacated the Trent Park site in October 2012, and in 2013 it was bought by Malaysia&#x27;s Allianze University College of Medical Sciences (AUCMS) for £30 million, but the buildings were never developed and the college closed in 2014. The house and 50 acres of grounds were sold to Berkeley Housing Group in September 2015. Campaigners wanted a museum opened in the house and were lobbying to ensure that this would become part of the official plan; the Trent Park Museum Trust was successful in this effort.

===Redevelopment===
Building of a new housing development began in late 2017, to eventually include 262 homes and flats. Some of the heritage buildings were to be re-purposed into luxury apartments; the plan included a museum on the two lower floors of the mansion, expected to open in 2020. The Middlesex University buildings were removed. Renovation of the mansion was expected to commence before the end of 2019. Landscape restoration on the North Lawn and on the south side of the lake was under way in 2019; a Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) was being installed in Trent Park. Other landscape work for the park was included in the plan. The former dairy in the park was being converted into apartments, each with a garden or terrace. Woburn Cottage was to be demolished, with the new building to house a gym; an outdoor swimming pool and tennis courts were to be added.

==Country Park==

In 1973 Trent Park was opened to the public as a country park, which at that time surrounded the university buildings and is 320 hectares in area.

For some years, country park included publicly accessible countryside, farmland, a golf course and an equestrian centre. Some of the grounds were attractively landscaped by Humphry Repton in the English manner (some also attribute the work of Capability Brown). Features of the original landscaping that can still be seen include an impressive avenue of lime trees, an obelisk, ornamental lakes and a water garden. The water garden was renovated in the 1990s by park ranger Arthur Newson.

Reports in summer 2019 indicated that Trent Country Park features included the cricket fields and the animal sanctuary (Wildlife Rescue Centre); the site included a Go Ape, a Country Club, a cafe in the main parking area and a children&#x27;s playground with new equipment. The Waymark Trails were ready for use by mid-June. The Friends of Trent Park made a brochure with map available for free download.

==Camlet Moat==

Within the country park, close to the Hadley Road entrance, is a small moated isle known as Camlet Moat. The name has been abbreviated over the years from &quot;Camelot&quot;, and it first appeared in local records in 1440.

The moat is protected under the Ancient Monuments &amp; Archaeological Areas Act 1979. A survey of the area conducted between 1956 and 1958 attributes the site as the seat of habitation of Geoffrey de Mandeville during the reign of William the Conqueror. A 2019 report states that the &quot;earliest documented reference to this site comes from the 14th century. There is also a documented fact that in May 1439 instructions were given to demolish the &#x27;Manor of Camelot&#x27;, suggesting there was a building on the site&quot;. Another source indicates that a lodge was located on this site, and demolished in 1429 and the materials sold to help pay for repairs to Hertford Castle.

Sir Philip Sassoon conducted excavations in the 1920s and was reported to have found oak beams which formed the basis of a drawbridge, Roman shoes and daggers as well as mosaic tiles depicting a knight. The walls and foundations of a large stone building were also found. English Heritage refilled the excavations in 1999.

The Historic England site states that the moat area was said to be a haunt of Dick Turpin in the 1700s.

==In fiction==
The exterior of the house was used as the location for scenes in the 1957 film &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;.

Trent Park was used as the location for scenes set in and around a boys&#x27; boarding school in the 1983 Doctor Who story, &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;, featuring Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor.

<text>The Istanbul Marathon (, also known as Türkiye İş Bankası Istanbul Marathon for sponsorship reasons) is an international athletics event hosted in Istanbul, Turkey, in November, first held in 1979. It is the only marathon in the world whose course spans two continents, Asia and Europe.

The three race categories for men and women are: marathon, 15 km and public run. A special category for disabled persons exists also. Participation in the public run was with 150,000 people a record set in 1998.

The event is organised by Istanbul Sports Events, which also hosts the annual Istanbul Half Marathon in April.

==History==

The Istanbul marathon has previously been known as &quot;Vodafone Istanbul Marathon&quot; as well as &quot;Intercontinental Istanbul Eurasia Marathon&quot;.

In 1997, Moges Taye of Ethiopia set the course record for men at the time of 2:13:37.

In 2005, Madina Biktagirova of Russia set the course record for women at the time of 2:34:25.

In 2006, Madina Biktagirova broke her own course record for women from the previous year with 2:28:21, and the course record for men was broken by the Lithuanian athlete Mindaugas Pukstas in 2:12:52. Also, for the first time in 2006, time keeping for marathon and 15 km was effected by means of a single-use chip, which was placed on the athlete&#x27;s shoe tied by shoelaces. An athlete without this so-called champion-chip would not receive an official time. In addition, the Istanbul Eurasia Marathon that year incorporated the 4th European Police Marathon Championships for the first time, which contributed to top results.

In 2012, the month the marathon was generally held was changed from October to November. That year, the 34th edition of the marathon was named &quot;Vodafone Istanbul Eurasia Marathon&quot;. Also that year, because the marathon had become a significant marathon event, it was awarded IAAF Gold Label status.

In 2013, around 20,000 local and foreigner athletes participated at the road race in different categories, among them wheelchair runners. The event saw also for the first time security measures concerning the bridge stability. Two years before, the running crowd on the Bosphorus Bridge caused dangerous instability by self-induced vibrations in the structure which could result in its failure. Influenced by this lesson, several start times with ten minutes intervals were held after the first start, which took place on 9:30 hours. The groups were not allowed to run on the bridge rather than to walk only. In order to avoid stopping for taking pictures, the outmost lanes of the bridge were blocked by barriers.

== Course ==
The course is asphalt, mostly flat and is free of traffic. It is the only course in the world where the marathon includes two continents, Asia and Europe, in one race.

The marathon starts on the Asian side of the city, shortly before the First Bosphorus Bridge, crosses the bridge giving an outstanding view of the Bosphorus and Istanbul, passes many historic sites including the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, and ends in the İnönü Stadium in the European part. In all, the race crosses three bridges, one over the Bosporus and two over the Golden Horn. The course changed three times over the years, therefore winning scores differ.

In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the course was altered to begin and end in Yenikapı and cross the Bosphorus Bridge twice, so runners would start and finish the marathon in Europe, but both enter and exit Asia during the run.

== Qualification ==

To register for the marathon, participants must be 18 years of age or older on the race day.

In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, athletes over the age of 65 were disallowed from participating in the marathon.

== Prizes ==
Money prizes are given to the first 25 male athletes and 15 best female athletes in the marathon category, the first 3 ranks receiving US$35,000, US$15,000 and US$10,000 respectively. An athlete, who broke the course record, is awarded with a bonus of US$5,000. Bonuses exists also for times run between 2:14:00 and 2:04:55 or better for men and between 2:33:00 and 2:15:25 or better for women, scaled from US$500 up to US$100,000. Prizes are also provided for the best ranking athletes in other competition categories.

In 2013, the total amount of the money prizes was US$1 million.

<text>St James&#x27;s University Hospital is a tertiary hospital in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England and is popularly known as ]]Jimmy&#x27;s. It is the 8th largest hospital by beds in the United Kingdom, popularised for its television coverage from 1987 to 1996. It is managed by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

The hospital is home to the Leeds Cancer Centre which provides specialist Oncology services to Leeds and the wider West Yorkshire region. Other specialist services based at St James&#x27;s include Hepatology, Pathology and the Cystic Fibrosis Unit.

==History==
The hospital has its origins in the Leeds Moral and Industrial Training School built in 1848 (which now forms part of the Lincoln Wing). Subsequent early developments included the Leeds Union Workhouse (which now houses the Thackray Museum of Medicine) built in 1858. The chapel, which is a Grade II listed building, was completed in 1861 by the firm of Perkin &amp; Beckhouse, of Leeds, and the Leeds Union Infirmary (the site of the present Gledhow Wing) was built in 1874.

By the end of the 19th century, the facilities were largely used for medical care of the poor, rather than as a workhouse. During the First World War it was called the East Leeds War Hospital, caring for armed services personnel. From 1881 the Medical Superintendent of the Leeds Union Infirmary was Dr James Allan. On his retirement in 1925, the infirmary was renamed St James&#x27;s Hospital, to honour him, and also Sir James Ford, of the Leeds Board of Guardians, who had overseen the conversion from workhouse to hospital.

The hospital expanded following the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 and the site was redeveloped during the 1960s. It was one of the hospitals investigated in 1967 as a result of the publication of Barbara Robb&#x27;s book &quot;Sans Everything&quot;. Accusations were made against a State Enrolled Nurse including &quot;assaults; the deliberate act of making an elderly female patient inebriated by means of brandy which had been issued to the ward; swearing at patients; mischievously and maliciously squirting spirit onto the bodies of elderly patients in order to give them shocks&quot;. There were also allegations of neglect and inefficiency, which were subsequently determined to have been unfounded.

In 1970, following expansion of Leeds School of Medicine, it was renamed St James&#x27;s University Hospital. The Chancellor&#x27;s Wing, which included a new Accident and Emergency Department, was opened by the then Chancellor of the University of Leeds, the Duchess of Kent, in February 1972.

A new oncology building, the Bexley Wing, containing the St James&#x27;s Institute of Oncology (including the Gamma Knife Centre) was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2004. It was designed by Anshen &amp; Allen and built by Bovis Lend Lease at a cost of £265 million and accepted its first patients in December 2007. It was officially opened by the Princess Royal on 17 July 2008. The building is one of Europe&#x27;s largest cancer centres, with 1,600 staff and 350 beds.

Since 2010, all Children&#x27;s Services have been consolidated at the Leeds General Infirmary across the city, also managed by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

As part of Leeds Teaching Hospitals &quot;Hospitals of the Future&quot; program, the Centre for Laboratory Medicine (CfLM)] opened in September 2023 at the hospital. It provides specialist pathology services for hospitals within the West Yorkshire Association of Acute Trusts (WYAAT).

==2002 serial killer incident==
In 2002, serial killer nurse Colin Norris, who worked on the orthopaedics ward of the hospital, killed two of his own patients in cold blood. He had been transferred to St James&#x27;s from Leeds General Infirmary, where it later materialised he had already murdered two patients and attempted to kill another. He was caught after Dr Emma Ward ordered blood tests on victim Ethel Hall, who despite only having a broken hip had inexplicably fallen into a hypoglycaemic coma, with the tests revealing that she had been secretly injected with a huge amount of insulin. Norris&#x27;s case was sent to the Court of Appeal in 2021 and he may now be released.

==2023 attempted bombing==
On 20 January 2023, a student nurse by the name of Mohammad Farooq, aged 27, was arrested after leaving an explosive device outside the maternity ward of the hospital. At the time of arrest, he was caught in possession of a Gediz 9mm PAK semi-automatic pistol. Prosecutors added that he was inspired by radical Islam, and that he carried out &quot;hostile reconnaissance&quot; of an RAF base on 10 and 18 January after carrying out online research and intended on carrying out a &#x27;lone wolf&#x27; attack. He was charged with engaging in conduct with the intention of committing acts of terrorism between 12 July 2022 and 20 January 2023.

==Facilities==
All of the hospital buildings except Chancellor&#x27;s Wing, which was named after the Duchess of Kent, a former Chancellor of the University of Leeds, are named after surrounding streets in the Leeds suburb of Harehills:
*Beckett Wing – Care of the Elderly
*Bexley Wing – Oncology
*Gledhow Wing
*Lincoln Wing
*Chancellor&#x27;s Wing

The hospital is one of six centres which conduct liver transplants. St James&#x27;s was the location of the first living-related donor Liver transplantation on the NHS. The University of Leeds has a large presence at the St James&#x27;s Hospital site with a new molecular medicine centre, the Wellcome Trust Brenner building. There is a notable cystic fibrosis unit in the Gledhow wing which offers specialist inpatient and outpatient services and research, and has its own method of management guidelines called the &quot;Cystic Fibrosis Leeds method of management&quot;. The Thackray Medical Museum adjoins the hospital site and is located in the Grade II listed former main building of the Leeds Union Workhouse.

==&quot;Jimmy&#x27;s&quot; TV series==
St James&#x27;s University Hospital&#x27;s fame derives in part from its extensive television coverage in the documentary series also titled &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s&quot;, produced by Yorkshire Television (YTV) between 1987 and 1996 for ITV.

<doc id="939668" wikidata="Q1813448" url="?curid=939668" title="You've Got a Friend">
<text>&quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; is a 1971 song by American singer-songwriter Carole King. It was first recorded by King and included on her second studio album, &quot;Tapestry&quot; (1971). Another well-known version by James Taylor appears on his album &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot;. His was released as a single in 1971, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number four on the UK Singles Chart. The two versions were recorded simultaneously in 1971 with shared musicians.

&quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; won Grammy Awards for both Taylor (Best Male Pop Vocal Performance) and King (Song of the Year) at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards in 1972. Dozens of other artists have recorded the song over the years, including Dusty Springfield, Michael Jackson, Anne Murray, and Donny Hathaway.

In 2001, Taylor&#x27;s version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. King&#x27;s version was inducted in 2002.

==History==
Carole King wrote &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; during the January 1971 recording sessions for her album &quot;Tapestry&quot; and James Taylor&#x27;s album &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot;. She has said that &quot;the song was as close to pure inspiration as I&#x27;ve ever experienced. The song wrote itself. It was written by something outside myself, through me.&quot; According to Taylor, King told him that the song was a response to a line in Taylor&#x27;s earlier song &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.&quot; King&#x27;s album was recorded in an overlap with Taylor&#x27;s, and Taylor, Joni Mitchell, and Danny Kortchmar perform on both versions of the song. The song is on both albums; King said in a 1972 interview that she &quot;didn&#x27;t write it with James or anybody really specifically in mind. But when James heard it he really liked it and wanted to record it&quot;.

Taylor&#x27;s version was released as a single and reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (his only song to do so) and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. Taylor&#x27;s version also spent a week atop the Easy Listening charts. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 16 song for 1971.

Taylor&#x27;s Apple Records labelmate Mary Hopkin has said that he gave her a chance to record the song, which she declined, a decision she later regretted.

Taylor and King performed &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; together in 2010 during their Troubadour Reunion Tour. In 2015, Taylor performed an acoustic rendition of the song at Hôtel de Ville, Paris, at the invitation of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo in tribute to the victims of the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks. King performed the song at the 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.

==Reception==
According to author James D. Perone, the song&#x27;s themes include an expression of &quot;a universal, sisterly/brotherly, agape-type love of one human being for another, regardless of gender.&quot; The &quot;reassuring&quot; lyrics have long made the song popular with lonely people needing a boost of self-confidence. The song&#x27;s messages of friendship having no boundaries and a friend being there when you are in need have universal appeal. The lyrics had particular resonance for Taylor due to the depression he had recovered from shortly before hearing King play the song. The music moves between a major and minor key, which according to music critic Maury Dean gives it a &quot;sympathetic mood&quot;.

In his review of &quot;Tapestry&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Jon Landau called &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; King&#x27;s &quot;most perfect new song&quot;. He particularly praised how the melody and lyrics support each other and the &quot;gorgeous, righteous rock melody&quot; of the ending lyrics. &quot;Mojo&quot; called the song probably &quot;the core of &quot;Tapestry&quot;&quot;. AllMusic critic Stewart Mason noted the &quot;plainspoken intimacy&quot; of King&#x27;s performance, writing that the &quot;shyness&quot; of her voice gives her recording a sincerity that he finds Taylor&#x27;s to lack. Mason also praises the &quot;depth and shading&quot; the string instruments provide on King&#x27;s recording.

In his review of &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Ben Gerson called &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; an &quot;affirmative song&quot; but suggested that Taylor&#x27;s version was too similar to King&#x27;s to have been worth including on his album. Music critic Maury Dean called Taylor&#x27;s performance style on the song minimalist and folkish and noted his &quot;star-spangled sincerity.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; praised the &quot;tasty material and Taylor&#x27;s stunning interpretation&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said, &quot;there&#x27;s no way [Taylor] can miss with this gem.&quot;

==Other versions==
Dusty Springfield recorded the song in early 1971 during the sessions for her third Atlantic Records album, &quot;Faithful&quot;. Her recording predates James Taylor&#x27;s, but was shelved until 1999, when it was included as a bonus track on the 1999 Deluxe Edition of her first Atlantic album, &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; (which contains four Carole King compositions). &quot;Faithful&quot; went unreleased due to disputes between Springfield and Atlantic, but the sessions were issued as a standalone album in 2015.

The song (and two others from &quot;Tapestry&quot;: &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Where You Lead&quot;) appear on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot;.

The song was recorded by Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway for their 1972 album &quot;Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway&quot; and was released as the album&#x27;s first single. The single was released a year before the album and, coincidentally, on the same date as Taylor&#x27;s single: May 29, 1971. The Flack and Hathaway version reached No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 8 on the R&amp;B chart.

Aretha Franklin recorded the song three times. The first and best-known was her 1972 live gospel performance &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, as part of a medley with &quot;Precious Lord, Take My Hand&quot;. She then recorded the song on &quot;Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King&quot; in 1995 alongside BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans, and in 2010 as a duet with Ronald Isley on his album &quot;Mr. I&quot;.

In 1973 or 1974, the Cambodian singer Pou Vannary covered the song with the lyrics translated into Khmer. Vannary&#x27;s rendition is featured on the 2015 documentary film &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot; soundtrack.

King, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, and Gloria Estefan performed &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; at the &quot;VH1 Divas Live&quot; concert at the Beacon Theatre, New York, in 1998. It was released as a promotional single in selected countries, reaching number 74 on the Belgian Flanders Airplay Chart on December 15, 1998.

Lynn Anderson released a country version of the song on her 1971 studio album &quot;How Can I Unlove You&quot;.

<text>The Hole is a 2001 British psychological thriller film directed by Nick Hamm, based on the 1993 novel &quot;After the Hole&quot; by Guy Burt. The film stars Thora Birch, Desmond Harrington, Daniel Brocklebank, Laurence Fox, Keira Knightley, and Embeth Davidtz. Filmed in 2000, the film featured Thora Birch in the lead role which was attributed to her appearance in &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999). It also marked Knightley&#x27;s first major role in a feature film.

&quot;The Hole&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 20 April 2001 and grossed a total of $7.8 million. Dimension Films, which in October 2001 acquired the rights to distribute the film theatrically in the United States, never did so; it was instead released direct-to-video nearly two years later, by Dimension&#x27;s then-fellow Disney subsidiary Buena Vista Distribution. The film was shot at Bray Studios and various locations around southern England, including Downside School in Somerset.

==Plot==
Private school student Liz resurfaces, disheveled and bloody, after disappearing 18 days prior along with her peers Mike, Geoff, and Frankie. Liz is interviewed by a psychiatrist, Dr. Phillipa Horwood. Liz recounts how her friend Martin arranged for the four to spend the weekend in an abandoned underground nuclear fallout shelter to avoid a school field trip. Liz portrays herself as being unpopular but as Frankie is her friend, she is able to convince the others to go down into the shelter.

When Martin fails to return for them, the four realise they are trapped, and begin to turn on one another. They discover hidden microphones in the shelter which were placed there by Martin. Attempting to get Martin&#x27;s attention, Frankie pretends to be ill, while Mike and Liz feign hatred for one another; Martin has had unrequited romantic feelings for her since their childhood. Liz claims they woke up one morning and found the hatch opened, allowing them all to finally escape.

Phillipa is skeptical of Liz&#x27;s story. Martin is subsequently taken into police custody, where he tells an entirely different story: he claims Liz and Frankie orchestrated the scheme for Liz to get to know Mike better, and for Frankie to spend time with Geoff. Liz is not the unpopular loner she has portrayed herself as: in fact, it is Martin who is the loner while Liz and Frankie are the popular girls. Meanwhile, Liz returns home, where she experiences disturbing flashbacks about what happened. An enraged Martin goes to visit Liz, believing she is framing him. She runs from him through the garden and approaches a weir. Martin cries, and Liz says she knew they would let him go because they could not prove anything.

At their next meeting, Liz tells Phillipa that she cannot remember what happened in the shelter. Despite Phillipa&#x27;s initial protestations, she agrees to Liz&#x27;s request to go back to the bunker, hoping to invoke her memory. Once inside, Liz reveals the truth: she had locked herself and her friends inside in the hopes of winning the affection of Mike, with whom she is obsessed. After discovering that both he and Geoff had slept with Frankie, she spontaneously decided to lock the door, isolating them and allowing her to become closer to Mike. The four had planned to drink and do drugs in the shelter, but the realisation that they are unable to escape throws the group into hysteria. Frankie soon becomes ill and is unable to stop vomiting. This increases her dehydration, tears the lining of her stomach, and puts a great strain on her heart (which is weakened by bulimia) leading to cardiac arrest and death.

Liz, Mike, and Geoff gradually run out of food and water. When Mike discovers that Geoff is hoarding a Coca-Cola in his backpack, he attacks him in a fit of rage and incidentally kills him by beating Geoff&#x27;s head repeatedly on the floor. Liz suggests a suicide pact whereupon Mike professes his love for her; this prompts her to climb the ladder to the shelter&#x27;s entrance and unlock the door. When Mike discovers that she had the key all along he attempts to chase after her, rapidly climbing the ladder and causing it to break. Mike falls, is impaled by the broken ladder, and dies.

After Liz finishes recounting the story, Phillipa asks her to make an official statement corroborating Martin&#x27;s version of events. Liz refuses, having murdered Martin when he visited her the day before. Police arrive at the shelter and Liz begins screaming for help, pretending Phillipa is attempting to hurt her. Meanwhile, Martin&#x27;s corpse is fished out of the river, and in his pocket, the police find the key to the shelter which implicates him in the events. The police attribute his death to suicide. Liz is allowed to go free. She leaves the shelter in the back of an ambulance, smirking at Phillipa from the window as it drives away.

==Production==
Nick Hamm began casting actors at the end of 1999. Hamm described newcomer Keira Knightley as a young version of Julie Christie. To prepare for the role, Thora Birch visited an English public school. Principal photography, which lasted six weeks, began on 2 July 2000 and ended on 9 November 2000. It took place around London and southern England with specific locations, including Downside Boarding School in Somerset, Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, Shenley Hall, Hertfordshire and Bray Studios. The film was shot in Super 35 format.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% based on reviews from 17 critics.

Michael Thomson, in a review for the BBC, said the film was a &quot;dark, grisly adventure&quot; influenced by William Golding&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, with the hole substituting for the island setting. He criticized the camerawork and some of the dialogue, but praised Thora Birch.

<text>A Light in the Attic is a book of poems by American poet, writer, and musician Shel Silverstein. The book consists of 135 poems accompanied by illustrations also created by Silverstein. It was first published by Harper &amp; Row Junior Books in 1981 and was a bestseller for months after its publication, but it has also been the subject of controversy regarding some of its content.

==Development==
In the back of the book, Silverstein credits author Charlotte Zolotow, Harper’s publicist Joan Robins, Harper’s executive editor Robert Warren, author James Skofield, private secretary Glenise Butcher, and John Vitale of HarperCollins. He also thanks Harper &amp; Row editor Ursula Nordstrom. The book was published in Harper’s Junior Books division in 1981, but was marketed towards adults as well.

==Summary==
There are 135 poems in this book.

== Reception ==
&quot;A Light in the Attic&quot; was number two on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list soon after its publication and remained on the list for 50 consecutive weeks. It sold more than 575,000 copies in the first year.

==Influence and legacy==
&quot;A Light in the Attic&quot; was praised by critics and audiences for years after its publication. In the fall of 2001, HarperCollins Children’s Books honored the 20th anniversary of the book with a special edition release that featured a separate CD of 11 poems performed by the beloved poet. It was the first children&#x27;s book to break onto the Adult &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Sellers list where it remained for 181 weeks.

Silverstein died from a heart attack on May 11, 1999, at the age of 68. According to an obituary published by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;To millions of children and adults, Mr. Silverstein was a master of whimsy and light satire, which he delivered in verse--sometimes downright goofy--that tapped a universal sense of the absurd.&quot;

==Controversies==
Attempts have been made to ban the book from some libraries in the United States, parents claiming that the poem &quot;How Not to Have to Dry the Dishes&quot; encourages messiness and disobedience. The poem &quot;Little Abigail and the Beautiful Pony&quot; resulted in criticism for describing the death of a little girl whose parents refuse to buy her a pony. This resulted in the book being banned by the Fruitland Park Elementary School in Lake County, Florida. The decision, however, was later reversed by an advisory committee of parents and teachers.

==Awards==
Winner of the 1984 William Allen White Children&#x27;s Book Award.

Winner of the 1984 Garden State Children’s Book Award for nonfiction from the New Jersey Library Association.

Named a 1981 American Library Association Notable Children&#x27;s Book.

Named a 1981 &quot;School Library Journal&quot; Best Book.

<doc id="939680" wikidata="Q864897" url="?curid=939680" title="Single-elimination tournament">
<text>A single-elimination knockout, or sudden-death tournament is a type of elimination tournament where the loser of a match-up is immediately eliminated from the tournament. Each winner will play another in the next round, until the final match-up, whose winner becomes the tournament champion(s). Some match-ups may be a single match or several, for example two-legged ties in European sports or best-of series in North American pro sports. Defeated competitors may play no further part after losing, or may participate in &quot;consolation&quot; or &quot;classification&quot; matches against other losers to determine the lower final rankings; for example, a third place playoff between losing semi-finalists. In a shootout poker tournament, there are more than two players competing at each table, and sometimes more than one progresses to the next round. Some competitions are held with a pure single-elimination tournament system. Others have many phases, with the last being a single-elimination final stage, often called playoffs.

==Nomenclature==
In English, the round in which only eight competitors remain is generally called (with or without hyphenation) the &quot;quarter-final&quot; round; this is followed by the &quot;semi-final&quot; round, in which only four are left, the two winners of which then meet in the &quot;final&quot; or &quot;championship round&quot;.
The round before the quarterfinals has multiple designations. Often it is called the &quot;round of sixteen&quot;, &quot;last sixteen&quot;, or (in South Asia) &quot;pre-quarterfinals&quot;. In many other languages the term for these eight matches translates to &quot;eighth-final&quot; (e.g., in these European languages: &quot;huitième de finale&quot; in French, &quot;achtste finale&quot; in Dutch, &quot;octavos de final&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Achtelfinale&quot; in German, &quot;åttondelsfinal&quot; in Swedish, &quot;ottavi di finale&quot; in Italian, &quot;oitavos-de-final&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;optimi de finală&quot; in Romanian, &quot;osmifinále&quot; in Czech, &quot;osemfinále&quot; in Slovak, and &quot;osmina finala&quot; in Serbo-Croatian), though this term is rare in English itself, with noticeable use in American debate tournaments.
The round before the round of sixteen is sometimes called &quot;round of thirty-two&quot; in English. Terms for this in other languages generally translate as &quot;sixteenth final&quot;.
Earlier rounds are typically numbered counting forwards from the first round, or by the number of remaining competitors. If some competitors get a bye, the round at which they enter may be named the &quot;first round&quot;, with the earlier matches called a &quot;preliminary round&quot;, &quot;qualifying round&quot;, &quot;opening round&quot;, or the &quot;play-in games&quot;.

Examples of the diverse names given to concurrent rounds in various select disciplines:

Notes:
==Example==
The knockout round of the 2002 FIFA World Cup  tournament:

==Classification==
Without any additional matches, the only position a single-elimination tournament can reliably determine is first - for example, if sorting the numbers 1-4 ascending, if 4 and 3 meet in the first round, 3 and 1 will lose in the first round and 2 will lose in the second, selecting 4 as the largest number in the set, but insufficient comparisons have been performed to determine which is greater, 1 or 3. Despite this, the candidate that loses in the final round is commonly considered to have taken second place (in this case, 2). When matches are held to determine places or prizes lower than first and second, these typically include a match between the losers of the semifinal matches called third place playoffs, the winner therein placing third and the loser fourth. Many Olympic single-elimination tournaments feature the bronze medal match if they do not award bronze medals to both losing semifinalists. The FIFA World Cup has long featured the third place match (since 1934), though the UEFA Euro has not held one since the 1980 edition.

Sometimes, contests are also held among the losers of the quarterfinal matches to determine fifth to eighth places. In one scenario, two &quot;consolation semifinal&quot; matches may be conducted, with the winners of these then facing off to determine fifth and sixth places and the losers playing for seventh and eighth; those are used often in qualifying tournaments where only the top five teams advance to the next round; or some method of ranking the four quarterfinal losers might be employed, in which case only one round of additional matches would be held among them, the two highest-ranked therein then playing for fifth and sixth places and the two lowest for seventh and eighth.

The number of distinct ways of arranging a single-elimination tournament (as an abstract structure, prior to seeding the players into the tournament) is given by the Wedderburn–Etherington numbers. Thus, for instance, there are three different arrangements for five players:
* The players may be divided into brackets of two and three players, the winners of which meet in the final game
* The bottom four players may play a two-round tournament, the winner of which plays the top player
* The bottom two players may meet, after which each subsequent game pairs the winner of the previous game with the next player
However, the number of arrangements grows quickly for larger numbers of players and not all of them are commonly used.

==Seeding==
Opponents may be allocated randomly (such as in the FA Cup); however, since the &quot;luck of the draw&quot; may result in the highest-rated competitors being scheduled to face each other early in the competition, &quot;seeding&quot; is often used to prevent this. Brackets are set up so that the top two seeds could not possibly meet until the final round (should both advance that far), none of the top four can meet prior to the semifinals, and so on. If no seeding is used, the tournament is called a random knockout tournament.

Standard seeding pairs the highest and lowest, then second highest and second lowest and so on, for an 8 seed tournament this is 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6 and 4 v 5, for example this is used for 16 seeds in the World Snooker Championship and 32 seeds in the World Darts Championship. Some tournaments stray from this, for example it is not the procedure that is followed in most tennis tournaments, where the 1 and 2 seeds are placed in separate brackets, but then the 3 and 4 seeds are assigned to their brackets randomly, and so too are seeds 5 through 8, and so on. This may result in some brackets consisting of stronger players than other brackets, and since only the top 32 players of 128 are seeded in Tennis Grand Slam tournaments, it can happen that the 33rd-best player in a 128-player field could end up playing the top seed in the first round. An example of this occurring was when World No. 33 Florian Mayer was drawn against, and defeated by, World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first round of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, in what was also a rematch of a quarter-final from the previous year.

Sometimes the remaining competitors in a single-elimination tournament will be &quot;re-seeded&quot; so that the highest surviving seed is made to play the lowest surviving seed in the next round, the second-highest plays the second-lowest, etc. This may be done after each round, or only at selected intervals. In American team sports, for example, the NFL employs this tactic, but MLS, NHL and the NBA do not (and neither does the NCAA college basketball tournament). Although MLB does have enough teams (12) in its playoff tournament where re-seeding would have made a large difference in the match-ups; only the WNBA&#x27;s at the minimum, which is at least four from each conference for a total of 8. The NBA&#x27;s format calls for the winner of the first-round series between the first and eighth seeds (within each of the two conferences the league has) to face the winner of the first-round series between the fourth and fifth seeds in the next round, even if one or more of the top three seeds had been upset in their first-round series; critics have claimed that this gives a team fighting for the fifth and sixth seeding positions near the end of the regular season an incentive to tank (deliberately lose) games, so as to finish sixth and thus avoid a possible match-up with the top seed until one round later. MLS&#x27; format is identical, except that the conference quarterfinals is a best-of-three series. 

In some situations, a seeding restriction may be implemented; from 1975 until 1989 in the NFL, and from 1994 until 2011 in MLB there was a rule where at the conference or league semifinal, should the top seed and last seed (wild card) be from the same division, they cannot play each other; in that case, the top seed plays the worst division champion; the second-best division champion plays the wild card team. This is due to the scheduling employed for the regular season, in which a team faces any given divisional opponent more often than any given non-divisional opponent – the tournament favors match-ups that took place fewer times in the regular season (or did not take place, in some cases).

In international fencing competitions, it is common to have a group stage. Participants are divided in groups of 6–7 fencers who play a round-robin tournament, and a ranking is calculated from the consolidated group results. Single elimination is seeded from this ranking.

==Evaluation==

The single-elimination format enables a relatively large number of competitors to participate. There are no &quot;dead&quot; matches (perhaps excluding &quot;classification&quot; matches), and no matches where one competitor has more to play for than the other. If a small number of teams play in a single elimination tournament, sometimes a consolation bracket is included to allow the eliminated teams to play more than once. This was the format of the Little League World Series until 1992.

The format is less suited to games where draws are frequent. In chess, each fixture in a single-elimination tournament must be played over multiple matches, because draws are common, and because white has an advantage over black. In association football, games ending in a draw may be settled in extra time and eventually by a penalty shootout or by replaying the fixture.

Another perceived disadvantage is that most competitors are eliminated after relatively few games. Variations such as the double-elimination tournament allow competitors a single loss while remaining eligible for overall victory. However, losing one game requires the competitor to win more games in order to win the tournament.

In a single-elimination tournament without any seeding, awarding the second place to the loser of the final is unjustified: any of the competitors knocked out before getting to play the losing finalist might have been stronger than the actual losing finalist. In general, it is only fair to use a single-elimination tournament to determine first place. To fairly determine lower places requires some form of round-robin in which each player/team gets the opportunity to face every other player/team.

Also, if the competitors&#x27; performance is variable, that is, it depends on a small, varying factor in addition to the actual strength of the competitors, then not only will it become less likely that the strongest competitor actually wins the tournament, in addition the seeding done by the tournament organizers will play a major part in deciding the winner. As a random factor is always present in a real-world competition, this might easily cause accusations of unfairness.

==Other tournament systems==
Variations of the single-elimination tournament include:
* Double-elimination tournament
* McIntyre system, a group of tournament formats that combine features of single- and double-elimination tournaments. Varieties of this system include:
** Page playoff system (four teams)
** Top five play-offs
** Top six play-offs
** McIntyre final eight system
** Super League play-offs, which formerly used a McIntyre final eight variant
** AFL final eight system, another variant of the McIntyre final eight, currently used by the Australian Football League
Other common tournament types include:
* Round-robin tournament
* Swiss-system tournament

<text>A double-elimination tournament is a type of elimination tournament competition in which a participant ceases to be eligible to win the tournament&#x27;s championship upon having lost &quot;two&quot; games or matches. It stands in contrast to a single-elimination tournament, in which only &quot;one&quot; defeat results in elimination.

One method of arranging a double-elimination tournament is to break the competitors into two sets of brackets, the &quot;winners&#x27; bracket&quot; and &quot;losers&#x27; bracket&quot; (&quot;W&quot; and &quot;L&quot; brackets for short; also referred to as &quot;championship bracket&quot; and &quot;elimination bracket&quot;, &quot;upper bracket&quot; and &quot;lower bracket&quot;, or &quot;main bracket&quot; and &quot;repechage&quot;) after the first round. The first-round winners proceed into the W bracket and the losers proceed into the L bracket. The W bracket is conducted in the same manner as a single-elimination tournament, except that the losers of each round &quot;drop down&quot; into the L bracket. Another method of double-elimination tournament management is the &quot;Draw and Process&quot;.

As with single-elimination tournaments, most often the number of competitors is equal to a power of two (8, 16, 32, etc.) so that in each round there is an even number of competitors and never any byes.

The number of games in a double-elimination tournament is one or two less than twice the number of teams participating (e.g. 8 teams would see 14 or 15 games).

==Conducting the tournament==
If the standard double-elimination bracket arrangement is being used, then each round of the L bracket is conducted in two stages: a minor stage followed by a major stage. Both contain the same number of matches (assuming there are no byes) which is the same again as the number of matches in the corresponding round of the W bracket. If the minor stage of an L bracket round contains matches, it will produce winners. Meanwhile, the matches in the corresponding round of the W bracket will produce losers. These 2 competitors will then pair off in the matches of the corresponding major stage of the L bracket.

For example, in an eight-competitor double-elimination tournament, the four losers of the first round, W bracket quarter finals, pair off in the first stage of the L bracket, the L bracket minor semifinals. The two losers are eliminated, while the two winners proceed to the L bracket major semifinals. Here, those two players/teams will each compete against a loser of the W bracket semifinal in the L bracket major semifinals. The winners of the L bracket major semifinals compete against each other in the L bracket minor-final, with the winner playing the loser of the W bracket final in the L bracket major final.

The final round of a double-elimination tournament is usually set up to be a possible two games, with the second referred to as the &quot;if game&quot;. In this structure, the L bracket finalist needs to win both games of the final round to be the tournament champion, while the W bracket finalist wins the tournament by winning game of the final round. If the final round is scheduled as only a single game, as in the 2018 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship, the W bracket finalist will be eliminated from the tournament if they lose this match, meaning the tournament is not truly a double-elimination tournament.

==Pros and cons==
The double-elimination format has some advantages over the single-elimination format, most notably the fact that third and fourth places can be determined without the use of a consolation or &quot;classification&quot; match involving two contestants who have already been eliminated from winning the championship.

Some tournaments, such as in tennis, will use &quot;seeding&quot; to prevent the strongest contestants from meeting until the later round. However, in tournaments where contestants are placed randomly in the draw, or in situations where seeding is not available, it is possible for two of the strongest teams to meet in the early rounds rather than a final or semifinal as would be expected in a seeded draw. Double elimination overcomes this shortfall by allowing a strong team which loses early to work their way through the L bracket and progress to the later rounds, despite meeting the strongest team in the early rounds of competition.

Another advantage of the double-elimination format is the fact that all competitors will play at least twice and three quarters will play three games or more. In a single-elimination tournament with no byes, half of the competitors will be eliminated after their first game. This can be disappointing to those who had to travel to the tournament and were only able to play once.

A disadvantage compared to the single-elimination format is that at least twice the number of matches have to be conducted. Since each competitor has to lose twice and since the tournament ends when only one competitor remains, in a tournament for competitors there will be either 2 − 2 or 2 − 1 games depending on whether or not the winner was undefeated during the tournament. This may result in a scheduling hardship for venues where only one facility for play is available. However, the number of matches is still lower than what is required by a Swiss-system tournament or round-robin tournament.

If the championship final has two matches scheduled (as typical of a double-elimination tournament), should the winners&#x27; bracket winner defeat the losers&#x27; bracket winner, the tournament ends. It is therefore unknown, until this match has been concluded, whether the second scheduled match will in fact be required. This can also be seen as a disadvantage of the system, particularly if broadcasting and ticket sales companies have an interest in the tournament.

Another disadvantage of the double-elimination format is the fact that some games are played by competitors that have completed an unequal number of matches so far in the tournament. For example, in a tournament with sixteen players, one needs to win four games to qualify for the final through the winners&#x27; bracket, whereas the finalist from the losers&#x27; bracket could have played anywhere between five and seven games to reach the same outcome. The differences in the number of matches for a given stage of a double-elimination tournament, especially in the later stages, could result in an uneven level of preparation or energy between competitors; a player in the winners&#x27; bracket may have a long wait between matches, while losers&#x27; bracket players have to play multiple games in a comparatively short timeframe. (Whether either situation will be an advantage for a particular player will vary individually.)

==Examples of use==

=== Baseball and softball ===

The NCAA Division I baseball and softball tournaments make heavy use of the double-elimination format. In both tournaments&#x27; regional stages, four teams contest each regional in a double-elimination bracket and the survivor advances to the best-of-three super regionals. The format recurs in both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s College World Series (MCWS and WCWS), where the field of 8 teams is divided into two double-elimination brackets and the survivor of each bracket advances to the best-of-three championship series. While the two brackets remain completely separate in the MCWS, there is a crossover feature in the WCWS, by which the loser of the second-round game in each bracket moves to the opposite bracket to play an elimination game. This format means that any two of the participating teams can advance to the championship series, which the current MCWS format does not allow.

The Little League World Series switched from round-robin to double-elimination formats for each of its pools starting in 2010 in an effort to eliminate meaningless games. The World Baseball Classic used a double-elimination format for its second rounds of the tournament in 2009 and 2013, as well as in its first round in 2009. The 2020 Olympic baseball event also used a modified double elimination bracket, combined with a preliminary group stage.

=== Other sports ===

Double-elimination brackets are also popular in amateur wrestling of all levels, whereas in professional wrestling, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) were the only professional wrestling promotions to date to use the double-elimination format. WCW used the format for a tournament for the vacant WCW World Tag Team Championship in 1999. On the June 26, 2002, weekly Asylum PPV, TNA used a double-elimination match to determine the TNA X Championship in a four-way match featuring AJ Styles, Jerry Lynn, Low Ki, and Psicosis.

Pool, surfing, windsurfing and kiteboarding freestyle competitions, as well as Curling bonspiels (where triple-elimination is also used), Hardcourt Bike Polo are all known to sometimes use double-elimination formats. It is also used in table football tournaments.

In contract bridge, the English Bridge Union Spring Foursomes, first contested in 1962, uses a double-elimination format. It is also used, in modified form, in the All-Ireland Senior Gaelic Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship.

It is also used largely in Esport competitions such as &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, &quot;Rocket League&quot; and numerous others. Four-team or four-player groups using double elimination are called &quot;GSL-style groups&quot; in reference to the Global StarCraft II League in Korea, which historically has used such a group format.

The FIRST Robotics Competition began using the double-elimination bracket starting with the 2023 season.

==Variations==
In judo, players that end up in the L bracket can finish in third place at best. The winner of the W bracket will win the tournament, with the losing finalist finishing second. The other losers of the W bracket will end up in the L bracket, which will only be played to the minor stage of the final, resulting in two players placed third. Thus, compared to double elimination, there is no major stage of the L bracket final played, and there is no game between the winners of the W and L brackets.

Another aspect of the system used in judo is that losers of the first round (of the W bracket) only advance to the L bracket if the player they lost to wins their match of the second round. If a player loses to a second round loser, they are eliminated from the tournament.

Another variant, called the &quot;(third-place) challenge&quot;, is used, particularly in scholastic wrestling. The winner of the L bracket may challenge the loser of the finals in the W bracket, if and only if the two contestants had not faced each other previously; if the challenger (the winner of the L bracket) wins, they are awarded second place, and the loser of the W final is dropped to third place. This system is used particularly where the top two places advance to a higher level of competition (example: advancement from a regional tournament to a state tournament).

Another is the &quot;balanced&quot; variant which is a bracket arrangement that is &quot;not&quot; strictly divided into two brackets based on number of losses. Players with different numbers of losses can play each other in any round. A goal of the variant is that no player sits idle for more than one round consecutively. The added complexity of the brackets is handled by using &quot;if necessary&quot; matches. The flexible approach allows practical bracket designs to be made for any number of competitors including odd numbers (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, etc.).

A possible alternative is a single-elimination format where each match is a best-of-5-or-more series. This format still allows a competitor to lose (perhaps multiple times) while still remaining eligible to win the tournament. Of course, having multiple games in each series also requires considerably more games to be conducted. It is also susceptible to bad seeding.

Another is the modified single-elimination tournament which guarantees at least two games per competitor, but not necessarily two losses for elimination. The brackets are similar to double-elimination, except the two finalists from the L bracket (each with one loss) face the two finalists from the W bracket (neither with a loss) in a single elimination semi-final and final.

The Little League World Series began using a modified double-elimination bracket in 2011. Eight U.S. teams and eight international teams compete in respective double elimination formats until their respective championship games, which are single elimination. That is, irrespective of whether a team has one loss, or no losses, that team would be eliminated with a loss in either the U.S. or international championship game. The two respective champions then play a single elimination game for the World Series championship.

Many esports competitions, such as The International use a variation on the double-elimination format where, after the initial group stage, the first round of the L bracket begins pre-seeded with the lower-performing teams from said stage, rather than all teams starting in the W bracket. Additionally, the finals are a single series regardless of winner, without any chance of a bracket reset if the L bracket winner wins the series. Much of this is due to time concerns, with some esports games taking upwards of an hour per match in a series, and the schedule not allowing for the additional time costs of scheduling like a traditional double-elimination tournament. However, many events that employ this format also schedule the event so that the W bracket teams have advantageous scheduling, with L bracket teams often having to play additional series on the final day, and W bracket teams getting considerably more time off to watch opponents.

==Other tournament systems==
Variations of the double-elimination tournament include:
* Elimination tournament
* Single-elimination tournament
Other common tournament types are
* Round-robin tournament
* Swiss system tournament
* Playoffs – a variation of the single-elimination tournament where instead of one win, a team needs to win a specific number of games in a series in order to advance.

<doc id="939696" wikidata="Q1014394" url="?curid=939696" title="Kahnawake">
<text>The Kahnawake [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] Territory (, in the Mohawk language, &quot;Kahnawáˀkye&quot; in Tuscarora) is a First Nations reserve of the Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada, across from Montreal. Established by French Canadians in 1719 as a Jesuit mission, it has also been known as &quot;Seigneury Sault du St-Louis&quot;, and &quot;Caughnawaga&quot; (after a Mohawk village in the Mohawk Valley of New York). There are 17 European spelling variations of the Mohawk &quot;Kahnawake&quot;.

Kahnawake&#x27;s territory totals an area of . Its resident population numbers slightly above 8,000, with a significant number living off reserve. Its land base today is unevenly distributed due to the federal Indian Act, which governs individual land possession. It has rules that are different from those applying to Canadian non-reserve areas. Most &quot;Kahnawake&quot; residents originally spoke the Mohawk language, and some learned French when trading with and allied with French colonists. Together with most of four Iroquois nations, including the Mohawk, they allied with the British government during the American Revolutionary War and the Lower Canada Rebellion. They have since become mostly English speaking.

Although people of European descent traditionally refer to the residents of Kahnawake as Mohawk, their autonym is &quot;Kanien’kehá:ka&quot; (the &quot;People of the Flint&quot;). Another meaning is &quot;those who speak [the language] Kanien&#x27;kéha&quot;). The &quot;Kanien’kehá:ka&quot; were historically the most easterly nation of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; (Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy) and are known as the &quot;Keepers of the Eastern Door&quot;. They controlled territory on both sides of the Mohawk River and west of the Hudson River in present-day New York, where they protected other parts of the confederacy to the west against invasion by tribes from present-day New England and the coastal areas.

Kahnawake is one of several self-governing Kanien’kehá:ka territories of the Mohawk Nation within the borders of Canada, including Kanesatake on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River northwest of Montreal; Tyendinaga in Ontario; Akwesasne, which straddles the borders of Quebec, Ontario and New York across the Saint Lawrence River; and the Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario north of Lake Erie. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the British considered Kahnawake one of the Seven Nations of Canada.

The name is derived from the Mohawk word &quot;kahnawà:ke&quot;, meaning &quot;place of the rapids&quot;, referring to their major village Caughnawaga near the rapids of the Mohawk River in what is today central New York. When converted Catholic Mohawk moved to the Montréal area, they named the new settlement after their former one. The proximity of the Lachine Rapids also influenced their naming decision.

==Location==

Kahnawake is located on the southwest shore where the Saint Lawrence River narrows. The territory is described in the native language as &quot;on, or by the rapids&quot; (of the Saint Lawrence River) (in French, it was originally called &quot;Sault du St-Louis&quot;, also related to the rapids). This term refers to their village being located along the natural rapids of the St. Lawrence. But in the mid-20th century, the path of the river was changed with construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway canal and the people lost access to the river.

The French colony of New France used &quot;Kahnawake&quot; as part of a southwestern defence for &quot;Ville-Marie&quot; (later Montreal) and placed a military garrison there. The Jesuits founded a mission to administer to local Mohawk and other First Nations. This was also a base for those missionary priests who were sent to the west. Jesuit records give a settlement date of 1719.

==Historical land claim==
Kahnawake was created under what was known as the Seigneurie du Sault-Saint-Louis, a territory which the French Crown granted in 1680 to the Jesuits to &quot;protect&quot; and &quot;nurture&quot; those Mohawk newly converted to Catholicism. When the seigneury was granted, the government intended the territory to be closed to European settlement. But the Jesuits assumed rights as seigneurs of the Sault, and permitted French and other European colonists to settle there and collected their rents.

The Jesuits managed the seigneury until April 1762, after the British defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War and took over their territory east of the Mississippi River in New France. The new British governor, Thomas Gage, ordered the reserve to be entirely and exclusively vested in the Mohawk, under the supervision of the Indian Department.

Despite repeated complaints by the Mohawk, many government agents continued to allow non-Native encroachment, and mismanaged the lands and rents. Surveyors were found to have modified some old maps at the expense of the Kahnawake people. From the late 1880s until the 1950s, the Mohawk were required by the government to make numerous land cessions to enable construction of railway, hydro-electric, and telephone company industrial projects along the river.

As a result, Kahnawake today has only . In the late 20th century, the Mohawk Nation was pursuing land claims with the Canadian government to regain lost land. The modern claim touches the municipalities of Saint-Constant, Sainte-Catherine, Saint-Mathieu, Delson, Candiac and Saint-Philippe. Led by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake and the reserve&#x27;s Inter-governmental Relations Team, the community has filed claims with the government of Canada. It is seeking monetary compensation NOTE: Kahnawake is not seeking financial compensation for the mismanagement of the land. Kahnawake recognizes the full extent of the &#x27;seigneury&quot; to be Kahnawake Mohawk Territory and is moving to reacquire its land along with financial compensation for infrastructure criscrossing the territory. and symbolic recognition of its claim.

==Multi-cultural community==
Kahnawake was settled by a variety of historic indigenous peoples, although the Mohawk became by far the majority. They and other tribes had a practice of adopting captives into the tribe, often to replace people lost to illness or warfare. They generally chose to adopt young women and children taken in raids, as these were believed to be more amenable to assimilation. Individual families adopted such captives, and made them full members of their clan and tribe. The practice preceded European encounter, but later some European captives were also assimilated as Mohawk. The Mohawk had a matrilineal kinship system, with children considered born into the clan of the mother and deriving their status from her family.

There was some European settlement after the reserve land was &quot;donated&quot; by the French Crown in the mid-17th century. The French government stationed French colonial troops there (who formed liaisons with local women and had children by them). Shopkeepers also formed families, and through the 18th century, many marriages occurred between European men and Indian women. Multiracial children born to Mohawk mothers were readily assimilated into the mother&#x27;s family, clan, and nation.

During the 17th and early 18th centuries, the English and French were competing in North America and in Europe. Together with allied First Nations or Native American tribes, they conducted raids along the undefined border between the territories of New France and New England. Captives were sometimes held for ransom, and European families and communities worked to buy them back. In some cases, families of the indigenous communities kept captives for adoption. For instance, more than 100 captives were taken during the 1704 Raid on Deerfield; they were forced overland to Montreal and Kahnawake. The minister of Deerfield was ransomed, but his teenage daughter was kept by a Mohawk family. She ultimately married a Mohawk man and had a family with him, choosing to stay with her new family rather than return to Deerfield.

As a result of this history, many Kahnawake people have been of mixed ancestry but identify as Mohawk. Backgrounds may include ancestry of other Iroquois tribes, such as the Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora; and/or French, English, Anglo-American, Scots and Irish. By the 1790s and early 19th century, visitors often described the visible &quot;great mixture of blood&quot; at Kahnawake. They noted that many children who appeared to be of European ancestry were being brought up culturally as Mohawk. At times there has been more tension about the relations of full-blood and mixed-race members of the tribe, both in the late 19th and 20th centuries. In other areas of Canada, particularly the Red River region in the west, Métis descendants of European trappers and indigenous women, gradually developed what has become a separate, recognized ethnic group, based on a distinct hunting and trading culture.

Kahnawake surnames, such as Beauvais, D&#x27;Ailleboust, de La Ronde Thibaudière, Delisle, de Lorimier, Giasson, Johnson, Mailloux, McComber, McGregor, Montour, Phillips, Rice, Stacey, Tarbell, and Williams, represent the evidence of tribal members&#x27; adoption of and intermarriage with non-Natives. Tarbell ancestors, for instance, were John and Zachary, brothers captured as young children from Groton, Massachusetts in 1707 during Queen Anne&#x27;s War and taken to Canada. Adopted by Mohawk families in Kahnawake, the boys became assimilated: they were baptized as Catholic and renamed, learned the Mohawk ways and were also given Mohawk names, married women who were daughters of chiefs, reared children with them, and became chiefs themselves.

Historic sources document the sometimes strained relations between Mohawk and ethnic Europeans at Kahnawake, usually over property and competition for limited resources. In 1722, community residents objected to the garrison of French soldiers because they feared it would cause &quot;horrible discord&quot; and showed the French did not trust the locals. In the mid-1720s, the community evicted the Desaulnier sisters, traders who were garnering profits formerly earned by members of Kahnawake. In 1771, twenty-two Mohawk pressed British officials to help them prevent two local families from bringing French families to settle &quot;on lands reserved for their common use&quot;. In 1812, many were opposed to specific types of &quot;mixed&quot; marriages. In 1822, Nicolas Doucet, an agent of the British Indian Department reported that the community was growing frustrated by marriages in which white husbands acquired rights over the lives and properties of their Mohawk wives according to British Canadian laws. This was in opposition to Iroquois culture, which had a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and property invested in the maternal line.

Abuse of alcohol was a continuing problem. In 1828, the village expelled white traders who were &quot;poisoning&quot; the Iroquois &quot;with rum and spirituous liquors&quot;. Tensions rose at the time of the 1837-38 Lower Canada Rebellion. The Mohawk had suffered incursions on their land, including non-Natives&#x27; taking valuable firewood. The Kahnawake cooperated with the British Crown against the &quot;Patriotes&quot;, largely over the issue of preserving their land and expressing their collective identity. Before and after the Rebellions, the community was fiercely divided regarding the rights of mixed-race residents, such as Antoine-George de Lorimier (the son of Claude-Nicolas-Guillaume de Lorimier), and whether he should be evicted. Although his mother was Mohawk and native to Kahnawake, because of his father&#x27;s and his own connections to the European community, George de Lorimier became a controversial figure in Kahnawake, even after his death in 1863.

In the 1870s and 1880s, land and resource pressures renewed local concern about ethnic Europeans living at Kahnawake. In addition, the national government&#x27;s passage of legislation, from enfranchisement to the Indian Advancement Act of 1884, which prohibited traditional chiefs and required Canadian-style elections, split the community and added to tensions. Some young Mohawk men wanted a chance to advance independently to being chiefs; other people wanted to keep the traditional, hereditary seven life chiefs selected from the seven clans.

The inequalities in landownership among Kahnawake residents led to resentment of the wealthy. For instance, in 1884, the multiracial sons of the late George de Lorimier were the largest and wealthiest landowners in the community. Some Kahnawake residents questioned whether people who were not full-blood Mohawk should be allowed to own so much land. The Mohawk Council asked members of the Giasson, Deblois, Meloche, Lafleur, Plante and de Lorimier families to leave, as all were of partial European ancestry. Some, like the de Lorimier brothers, gradually sold their properties and pursued their lives elsewhere. Others, such as Charles Gédéon Giasson, were finally given permanent status at the reserve.

Because the Indian Department did not provide adequate support to the reserve, the community continued to struggle financially. At one point, the Kahnawake chiefs suggested selling the reserve to raise money for annuities for the tribe. Social unrest increased, with young men attacking houses, barns and farm animals of people they resented. In May 1878 an arson fire killed Osias Meloche, the husband of Charlotte-Louise Giasson (daughter of Charles Gédéon Giasson, noted above), and their home and barn were destroyed. Under the Walbank Survey, the national government surveyed and subdivided the land of the reserve, allotting some plots individually to each head of household eligible to live in Kahnawake. The violence stopped as the new form of privatisation of land was instituted, but antagonism toward some community members did not.

The election of council chiefs began in 1889, but the influence of Kahnawake&#x27;s shadow government of traditional clan chiefs persisted. This lasted into the 1920s, when the traditional seven-clan system became absorbed in the Longhouse Movement, which was based on three clans. This was strong through the 1940s.

==Effects of construction projects in/through community==

Historically, the federal and Quebec governments have often located large civil engineering projects benefiting the southern Quebec economy through &quot;Kahnawake&quot; land because of its proximity to the Saint Lawrence River. The reserve is criss-crossed by power lines from hydroelectric plants, railways, and vehicle highways and bridges. One of the first of such projects was the fledgling Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Saint-Laurent Railway Bridge. The masonry work was done by Reid &amp; Fleming, and the steel superstructure was built by the Dominion Bridge Company. In 1886 and 1887, the new bridge was built across the broad river from Kahnawake to the Island of Montreal. Kahnawake men worked as bridgemen and ironworkers hundreds of feet above the water and ground.

When the national government decided to pass the Saint Lawrence Seaway canal cut through the village, the people and buildings of Kahnawake were permanently separated from the natural river shore. The loss of land and access to the river, the demolition of houses, and the change in the community&#x27;s relationship to the river have had profound effects on Kahnawake. The people had been sited there for hundreds of years, and their identities were related to a profound knowledge of the river, from the time they were children through adulthood. One effect of the losses was to make the community determined not to suffer more encroachment. They drew together and became stronger.

==Working in New York==

The Mohawk success on major high-rise construction projects inspired the legend that Native American men had no fear of working at heights. Numerous Kahnawake men continued as iron and steelworkers in Canada. Thirty-three Kahnawake (Mohawk) died in the collapse of the Quebec Bridge in 1907, one of the worst construction failures of all time. The small community was devastated by the loss of so many men. They erected crosses of steel girders at both ends of the reserve to honour them.

Many Kahnawake ironworkers went to New York City to work during the first half of the 20th century. Its building boom stimulated construction of notable skyscrapers and bridges. For more than a generation, many Kahnawake men participated in building the Empire State Building, and other major skyscrapers in New York City, as well as many bridges. They brought their families with them, and most Mohawk from Kahnawake lived in Brooklyn. They called their neighbourhood &quot;Little Caughnawaga&quot; after their homeland. While the men worked on skyscrapers, the women created a strong community for their families. Many also worked outside the home. In the summers, the families would return to Kahnawake to stay with relatives and renew connections. Some of the people who grew up in Brooklyn as children still have the local New York accent, although they have long lived in Kahnawake.

Kahnawake high steel workers in New York were the subject of the 1966 documentary &quot;High Steel&quot;, as seen through the story of Harold McComber.

==Late 20th century to present==
The elected Mohawk Council of Kahnawake (MCK) have generally established predominance in governing the reserve. This elected government is the only body with which the Canadian government will deal.

=== Membership and residency on the reserve ===
With continuing late 20th-century conflicts over who could reside at the reserve, the elected chiefs of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake (MCK) passed laws regulating membership or eligibility for residence at Kahnawake. In 1981 they passed a law that non-natives could not reside in the community; those Mohawk who marry outside of the nation lose the right to live in the homeland. The MCK said that its policy was to preserve the people&#x27;s cultural identity. In the 21st century, they did not want non-Natives living at the reserve, even if a person had adopted the Mohawk language or culture.

The policy is based on a 1981 community moratorium on non-Native residency, which Kahnawake enacted into law in 1984. All couples who had a non-Mohawk partner were sent eviction notices regardless of how long they had lived on the reserve. The only exemption was for those of such couples who had married before the 1981 moratorium. Although some concerned Mohawk citizens contested the racially exclusive membership policy, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled that the Mohawk Kahnawake government may adopt policies it deems necessary to ensure the survival of its people.

In February 2010, the issue was renewed when the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake elected to evict 35 non-Natives from the reserve. While the action was legal according to the membership laws, critics believed the council was acting specifically against some individuals. These persons had lived on the reserve for 10 years or more and contributed to the community. The council said they were responding to complaints from residents about limited housing and land being occupied by non-Natives. The eviction resolution, endorsed by all 12 chiefs of the MCK, caused an uproar within and beyond the community, attracting national press attention.

Steve Bonspiel, publisher and editor of Kahnawake newspaper &quot;The Eastern Door&quot;, said that the issue dated back to 1973. At that time, when non-Native people with no ties in the community were asked to leave, they were harassed and even physically attacked. Bonspiel thought the council&#x27;s 2010 threat to publish the names of people ineligible to live on the reserve was inappropriate as a means to use public pressure and potentially physical threat against them. Coverage of this issue by the &quot;Eastern Door&quot; that year resulted in the council reversing their decision.

The Federal Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl said there was nothing illegal about the band&#x27;s eviction of non-members:
Ellen Gabriel, the head of the Quebec Native Women&#x27;s Association and a Mohawk resident at Kanesatake, criticized the MCK. She said their actions did not represent the traditional inclusiveness of Mohawk communities, which had historically assimilated adoptees and marriage partners. She criticized the council for interfering in the private lives of persons who had chosen non-Native partners. She noted the Mohawk had long been successful at integrating people within their communities, and have still preserved their language and culture over the centuries.

Some residents who received eviction notices agreed to leave; others proved they spend only limited time in the community, so were permitted as visitors. The council said it would send second notices to people who did not respond, and then would publish their names. The governing band council defended its right to ask non-Natives to leave the small community:
In September 2014, the council revived the issue of non-Native residents, announcing community meetings for discussion and plans to issue a new regulation. It barred non-Kahnawake residents from the meeting.

=== Restorative justice ===
Before European contact, the Iroquois Confederacy (&quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;) had a long tradition of justice administered within the clan and council system. The clan would govern the behaviour of clan members, and conflict between members of clans would be settled by consensus of the council. Clan mothers as well as chiefs had roles in this system. The goal was to quickly restore peace to the community and control behaviour that threatened it. The system was based on the four principles of reason, persuasion, satisfaction and compensation, with both wrongdoer and victim as part of the process. It was intended to achieve &quot;[d]ue compensation and condolence, and a promise of agreement&quot; between the parties.

Many at Kahnawake and other First Nations communities believe their people are not being well served by the Canadian justice system. First Nations people are over-represented in it and in prisons. They believe this is in part due to the imposition of the Canadian justice system on traditional ways, by which the government has tried to assimilate the First Nations into European-based culture. The Canadian government has gradually favoured &quot;indigenization&quot; of the system. Kahnawake used section 107 of the Indian Act to nominate community members as justices of the peace, and in 1974 Justice Sharron was appointed as the first justice of the peace at the reserve. Many of the cases have dealt with traffic and parking violations, but her scope is wider, as the JP has jurisdiction over Criminal Code offences related to the following four areas: cruelty to animals, common assault, breaking and entering, and vagrancy. The &quot;Kanien’kehá:ka&quot; wanted further improvements.

Since 2000, Kahnawake has started to reintroduce &quot;Skenn:en A&#x27;onsonton&quot; (to become peaceful again), the traditional justice system of the Iroquois. It wanted to create an alternative dispute resolution process, as developed by the First Nation, or &quot;reintroduced&quot; according to its principles. The Justice Committee of the MCK and representatives of the Longhouse jointly presented the initiative to the community. Based on wrongdoing that has taken place within the geographic area of Kahnawke, the system is intended for use before any arrest of an affected party under the Canadian system. It has procedures to be used by the victim and offender, and their supporters. With assistance by trained facilitators to resolve issues, the process is intended to restore peace and harmony, rather than to be an adversarial process. In contrast to the Canadian system of adversarial justice it,

The initiative has challenges, for instance, gaining the support of Peacekeepers and community members who may not be familiar with these traditional cultural principles. But, it is an important means of re-education into principles that offer an alternative to the current Canadian system, and helps build a future especially for the young people of the community.

==Gambling/gaming==
The Kahnawake Gaming Commission offers licenses to Internet-based gambling sites for poker, casino, and sportsbook. It has established Kahnawake as a substantial player in that business.

Mohawk Internet Technologies (MIT), a local data centre located within the territory, hosts and manages many Internet gambling websites, and provides high-tech employment to its people. MIT is the closest and fastest source for &quot;legally hosted&quot; gambling websites for North American players. Established in 1998, MIT by 2006 had become a &quot;remarkably profitable&quot; enterprise.

==Politics==

While working to strengthen their culture and language, the people of Kahnawake have generally not had the political turmoil of the nearby, smaller Kanesatake reserve. In support of Kanesatake during its Oka Crisis in 1990, people from Kahnawake blocked the Honoré Mercier Bridge to Montreal, which had an access road through their reserve. The Kanesatake reserve had been blockaded and isolated by the Sûreté du Québec in a conflict over use of lands the Mohawk considered sacred.

The bridge blockade affected the commute of many locals throughout the summer, leading to rioting and the burning of effigies, and to the &quot;Whiskey Trench&quot; episode. On August 28, 1990, a convoy of 50 to 75 cars, bearing mostly women, children and elders, left Kahnawake in fear of a possible advance by the Canadian Army. While the Mohawks&#x27; cars were being searched by the provincial police force, a crowd of hundreds gathered on the Montreal side of the highway; many in the crowd threw rocks and chairs at the cars and yelled ethnic slurs. Many windows were broken and some Mohawk were hit by rocks and cut by glass. Thirteen people were arrested. Blame has fallen on the provincial government for letting the convoy pass; on the Sûreté du Québec for holding the cars for so long, and for mostly not stopping people from throwing rocks; on the lack of police or army or riot squad; and on local radio stations that broadcast the location of the convoy.

After some time, Kahnawake negotiated separately with the armed forces to remove the blockade to the bridge.

Fifty men from Kahnawake volunteered to fight with the United States armed forces during the Vietnam War.

==International use of Kahnawake flag==
In 2007, two vessels operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society flew the Kahnawake Mohawk flag. The Kahnawake Mohawk nation is the only indigenous American sovereign nation to have deep-sea foreign-going vessels flying its flag. Since December 2007, the Sea Shepherd vessels have been registered in the Netherlands.

==Historic sites==

Kahnawake contains three National Historic Sites of Canada: Fort St-Louis, the Jesuit Mission of St-François-Xavier, and the Caughnawaga Presbytery.

==Representation in other media==
*Reaghan Tarbell, a native of Kahnawake, wrote and directed a one-hour documentary, &quot;Little Caughnawaga: To Brooklyn and Back&quot; (2008), about the families from Kahnawake who migrated to work in New York. It focused on the early 20th-century community created by the women where they settled in Brooklyn, while the men worked on steel skyscrapers and bridges. It was later released in the US as &quot;A Mohawk Journey: To Brooklyn and Back&quot; (2010).
*In Tracey Deer’s drama film Beans, the 1990 Oka Crisis at Kanesatake is explored. Deer lived the crisis as a child and show it through the eyes of a preteen girl named Tekehentahkhwa (nicknamed &quot;Beans&quot;). Beans&#x27;s perspective on life is radically changed by these events.

<doc id="939699" wikidata="Q4087213" url="?curid=939699" title="Bisects and splits">
<text>Bisects and splits refer to postage stamps that have been cut in part, most commonly in half, but also other fractions, and postally used for the proportionate value of the entire stamp, such as a two cent stamp cut in half and used as a one cent stamp. When stocks of a certain stamp ran out, postmasters sometimes resorted to cutting higher denominated stamps in half, vertically or diagonally, thus obtaining two &quot;stamps&quot; each representing half of the original monetary value, or &quot;face&quot; value, of the uncut stamp. The general public also resorted to this practice, sometimes pursuant to official or tacit permission and sometimes without any express authorization.

Many of these instances have been well documented in postal history. One example is the bisects of the Island of Guernsey during the German military occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II. Early Mexican stamps are known to have been used cut in half, three-quarters, quarters and even eighths.

Many bisects and splits are considerably more valuable than the stamps from which they were made. These, however, only have philatelic value when the cut portion is still affixed to the envelope or a piece showing the postmarks, as otherwise it cannot be confirmed that the stamp was in fact postally used as a split and not simply a complete stamp that was cut up after use.

<text>The Saccocirridae are small interstitial polychaetes common in coarse sand on reflective, surf beaches, usually within the zone of retention. Saccocirridae have a worldwide distribution and many more species likely remain to be described. These polychates are usually between in length and 500 μm wide. They have reduced parapodia and are considered a true interstitial species, incapable of burrowing through finer sediments.

== Morphology ==
Based on &quot;Saccocirrus sonomacus&quot; from the Pacific Coast of the Americas, the prostomium supports a pair of grooved palps that have a primarily sensory purpose. A pair of eyes are also present. The peristomium is probably reduced to a circumoral ring. The pygidium is usually bilobed.

<doc id="939703" wikidata="Q3709969" url="?curid=939703" title="Dyscrasia">
<text>In medicine, both ancient and modern, a dyscrasia is any of various disorders. The word has ancient Greek roots meaning &quot;bad mixture&quot;. The concept of dyscrasia was developed by the Greek physician Galen (129–216 AD), who elaborated a model of health and disease as a structure of elements, qualities, humors, organs, and temperaments (based on earlier humorism). Health was understood in this perspective to be a condition of harmony or balance among these basic components, called eucrasia. Disease was interpreted as the disproportion of bodily fluids or four humours: phlegm, blood, yellow bile, and black bile. The imbalance was called dyscrasia. In modern medicine, the term is still occasionally used in medical context for an unspecified disorder of the blood, such as a plasma cell dyscrasia.

==Ancient use==
To the Greeks, it meant an imbalance of the four humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and water (phlegm). These humors were believed to exist in the body, and any change in the balance among the four of them was the direct cause of all disease.

This is similar to the concepts of bodily humors in the Tibetan medical tradition and the Indian Ayurvedic system, which both relate health and disease to the equality (Skt. &quot;samatā&quot;) or inequality (Skt. &quot;viṣamatā&quot;) of the quantities of three (or four) bodily humors, generally translated as wind, bile, and phlegm (and blood). 

==Modern use==
The term is still occasionally used in medical contexts for an unspecified disorder of the blood. Specifically, it is defined in current medicine as a morbid general state resulting from the presence of abnormal material in the blood, usually applied to diseases affecting blood cells or platelets. Evidence of dyscrasia can be present with a WBC (white blood cell) count of over 1,000,000.

&quot;Plasma cell dyscrasia&quot; is sometimes considered synonymous with paraproteinemia or monoclonal gammopathy.

H2 receptor antagonists, such as famotidine and nizatidine, in use for treatment of peptic ulcers, are known for causing blood dyscrasia – leading to bone marrow failure in 1 out of 50,000 patients.

<doc id="939704" wikidata="Q1062620" url="?curid=939704" title="Petticoat">
<text>A petticoat or underskirt is an article of clothing, a type of undergarment worn under a skirt or a dress. Its precise meaning varies over centuries and between countries.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, in current British English, a petticoat is &quot;a light loose undergarment ... hanging from the shoulders or waist&quot;. In modern American usage, &quot;petticoat&quot; refers only to a garment hanging from the waist. They are most often made of cotton, silk or tulle. Without petticoats, skirts of the 1850s would not have the volume they were known for. In historical contexts (16th to mid-19th centuries), &quot;petticoat&quot; refers to any separate skirt worn with a gown, bedgown, bodice or jacket; these petticoats are not, strictly speaking, underwear, as they were made to be seen. In both historical and modern contexts, &quot;petticoat&quot; refers to skirt-like undergarments worn for warmth or to give the skirt or dress the desired attractive shape.

==Terminology==
Sometimes a petticoat may be called a &quot;waist slip&quot; or &quot;underskirt&quot; (UK) or &quot;half slip&quot; (US), with &quot;petticoat&quot; restricted to extremely full garments. A chemise hangs from the shoulders. &quot;Petticoat&quot; can also refer to a full-length slip in the UK, although this usage is somewhat old-fashioned.

== History ==

In the 14th century, both men and women wore undercoats called &quot;petticotes&quot;. The word &quot;petticoat&quot; came from Middle English or , meaning &quot;a small coat/cote&quot;. &quot;Petticoat&quot; is also sometimes spelled &quot;petty coat&quot;. The original petticoat was meant to be seen and was worn with an open gown. The practice of wearing petticoats as undergarments was well established in England by 1585. In French, petticoats were called . The , worn in Spain, was considered a type of petticoat.

The petticoat in western men’s dress, what would become known in later years develop into the waistcoat, was from the mid-15th century to around the 17th century an under-doublet. The garment was worn in cooler months under a shirt for warmth, and was usually padded or quilted.

In the 18th century in Europe and in America, petticoats were an integral component of a gown, considered a part of the exterior garment and were meant to be seen. The term petticoat was used to refer to such an outer skirt from the 16th to the 19th century, which were fashioned from either matching or contrasting textiles, in simple fabrics, or were highly decoratively embroidered. An underpetticoat was considered an undergarment and was shorter than a regular petticoat. Underpetticoats were also known as a &quot;dickey&quot;. Also in the American colonies, working women wore shortgowns (bedgowns) over petticoats that normally matched in color. The hem length of a petticoat in the 18th century depended on what was fashionable in dress at the time. Often, petticoats had slits or holes for women to reach pockets inside. Petticoats were worn by all classes of women throughout the 18th century. The style known as polonaise revealed much of the petticoat intentionally.

In the early 19th century, dresses became narrower and simpler with much less lingerie, including &quot;invisible petticoats&quot;. Then, as the waltz became popular in the 1820s, full-skirted gowns with petticoats were revived in Europe and the United States.

In the Victorian era, petticoats were cemented as undergarments, used to give bulk and shape to the skirts worn over the petticoat. By the mid 19th century, petticoats were worn over hoops also known as crinoline. Popular white cotton petticoats as an undergarment in the 1860s, for example, regularly featured a lace and broderie anglaise decorative border. As the bustle became popular in the 1870s, petticoats developed flounces towards the back in order to cater for this style of under structure. Petticoats also continued to be worn in layers through this decade. Coloured petticoats came into fashion by the 1890s, with many being made from silk and featuring decorative frills to the bottom edge.

In the early 20th century, petticoats were circular, had flounces and buttons, in which women could attach additional flounces to the garment. Bloomers were also touted as a replacement for petticoats when working and by fashion reformers.

After World War I, silk petticoats were in fashion.

Petticoats were revived by Christian Dior in his full-skirted &quot;New Look&quot; of 1947, and tiered, ruffled, stiffened petticoats remained extremely popular during the 1950s and 1960s. These were sold in a few clothing stores as late as 1970.

Sybil Connolly recalled how a red flannel petticoat, worn by a Connemara woman, inspired her first international fashion collection which took place in New York in 1953. She had travelled to Connemara for inspiration, where she saw a woman wearing a traditional red flannel petticoat. She bought a bolt of the same fabric from the local shop and made it into a quilted evening skirt, which was a huge success at the fashion show. One of these skirts is part of the collection at The Hunt Museum.

== Non-Western petticoats ==
Compared to the Western petticoat, South Asian petticoats are rarely shorter than ankle length and are always worn from the waist down. They may also be called inner skirts or inskirts.

In Japan, similar to a &quot;petticoat&quot;, a (commonly referred to simply as a ; a is sometimes worn underneath a ) are worn under the kimono as a form of underwear similar in function to the petticoat. The resembles a shorter kimono, typically without two half-size front panels (the ) and with sleeves only marginally sewn up along the wrist-end. are commonly made of white silk, though historically were typically made of red silk; as the collar of the shows underneath the kimono and is worn against the skin, a half-collar (a ) is often sewn to the collar as a protector, and also for decoration. The is sometimes worn underneath the , and resembles a tube-sleeved kimono-shaped top, without a collar, and an accompanying skirt slip.

==In popular culture==
The early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft was disparaged by Horace Walpole as a &quot;hyena in petticoats&quot;. Florentia Sale was dubbed &quot;the Grenadier in Petticoats&quot; for travelling with her military husband Sir Robert Henry Sale around the British Empire.

The phrase &quot;petticoat government&quot; has referred to women running government or domestic affairs. The phrase is usually applied in a positive tone welcoming female governance of society and home, but occasionally is used to imply a threat to &quot;appropriate&quot; government by males, as was mentioned in several of Henry Fielding&#x27;s plays. An Irish pamphlet &quot;Petticoat Government, Exemplified in a Late Case in Ireland&quot; was published in 1780. The American writer Washington Irving used the phrase in Rip Van Winkle (1819). Frances Trollope wrote &quot;Petticoat Government: A Novel&quot; in 1850. Emma Orczy wrote &quot;Petticoat Government&quot;, another novel, in 1911. G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936) mentions petticoat in a positive manner; to the idea of female dignity and power in his book &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With the World&quot; (1910) he states:
President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s administration was beset by a scandal called the &quot;Petticoat affair&quot;, dramatized in the 1936 film &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot;. A 1943 comedy film called &quot;Petticoat Larceny&quot; (cf. petty larceny) depicted a young girl being kidnapped by grifters. In 1955, Iron Curtain politics were satirized in a Bob Hope and Katharine Hepburn film &quot;The Iron Petticoat&quot;. In the same year Western author Chester William Harrison wrote a short story &quot;Petticoat Brigade&quot; that was turned into the film &quot;The Guns of Fort Petticoat&quot; in 1957. Blake Edwards filmed a story of an American submarine filled with nurses from the Battle of the Philippines called &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959). &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was a CBS TV series that aired in 1963. CBS had another series in the 1966–67 season called &quot;Pistols &#x27;n&#x27; Petticoats&quot;.

<text>Zed is a New Zealand rock group, which formed as Supra in 1996 in Christchurch by Ben Campbell on bass guitar and triangle, Nathan King on lead vocals, guitar and trumpet, and Adrian Palmer on drums and percussion. In 2000 they added a second guitarist, Andrew Lynch. Their debut album, &quot;Silencer&quot; (2000), peaked at No. 1 on the New Zealand Albums Chart; while their second album, &quot;This Little Empire&quot; (November 2003), reached No. 3. Their top 10 singles are &quot;Glorafilia&quot; (1999), &quot;Renegade Fighter&quot; (2000), and &quot;Hard to Find Her&quot; (2003). They toured New Zealand, Australia and United States before disbanding in 2004. They have reformed periodically including in 2017, 2019 and 2023.

==History==

Zed was formed in 1996 as Supra by students at Christchurch&#x27;s Cashmere High School: Ben Campbell on bass guitar, Nathan King on lead vocals and guitar, and Adrian Palmer on drums. Initially playing cover versions of work by &quot;Crowded House, Supergrass, Blur and Radiohead they started getting together in each other&#x27;s bedrooms to practice the kind of hook laden pop music they were listening to.&quot; Campbell&#x27;s father contacted talent manager, and former rock-and-roll artist, Ray Columbus. Columbus had them signed to a publishing deal for their original material and booked their early recording sessions. In 2000 they added Andy Lynch (Sensei Master) as second guitarist.

The band worked with producer David Nicholas on their debut album, &quot;Silencer&quot; (2000). Rhythm and vocal tracks were recorded at Revolver Studios in Auckland, with final overdubbing and mixing at Mangrove Studios, north of Sydney, Australia. Released in New Zealand later that year, &quot;Silencer&quot;, debuted at No. 1 on the New Zealand Album Charts, and was certified triple platinum. It provided in six top 40 singles with &quot;Renegade Fighter&quot; (2000) peaked at No. 4. 

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;This Little Empire&quot;, was released with two different track lists, one for the New Zealand market in 2003, and another aimed at the United States the following year. In total Zed had ten top 40 singles in New Zealand.

Zed disbanded in 2004, they subsequently reunited for a few live gigs (a 2008 performance at Auckland&#x27;s Vector Arena, and two corporate events in 2011). Nathan King launched a solo career, then later sang with band Paper Planes. Campbell and Lynch formed a new band, Atlas, which disbanded in late 2008. Lynch was working as a session musician in Auckland. In 2017 Zed reunited to perform live. In 2019 they undertook a national tour to celebrate 20 years of &quot;Silencer&quot;. In 2023, they announced a comeback by releasing a live video of &quot;Renegade Fighter&quot; online. They also released the single &quot;Future You&quot;, which was included on their third album &quot;Future Memory&quot;, released in August 2024. They toured nationwide in New Zealand in November and December 2023.

<text>Wat Chedi Luang (, lit. &quot;temple of the big stupa&quot; or &quot;temple of the royal stupa&quot;) is a Buddhist temple in the historic centre of Chiang Mai, Thailand. The current temple grounds were originally made up of three temples — Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Ho Tham and Wat Sukmin.

==History==
The construction of the temple started in the 14th century, when King Saen Muang Ma planned to bury the ashes of his father in the place. After 10 years of building time it was left unfinished, later to be continued after the death of the king by his widow. Probably due to stability problems it took until the mid-15th century to be finished during the reign of king Tilokaraj. It was then 82 m high and had a base diameter of 54 m, at that time the largest building of all Lanna. In 1468, the Emerald Buddha was installed in the eastern niche. In 1545, the upper 30 m of the structure collapsed after an earthquake, and shortly thereafter, in 1551, the Emerald Buddha was moved to Luang Prabang.

In the early 1990s the chedi was reconstructed, financed by UNESCO and the Japanese government. However the result is somewhat controversial, as some claim the new elements are in Central Thai style, not Lanna style. For the 600th anniversary of the chedi in 1995, a copy of the Emerald Buddha made from black jade was placed in the reconstructed eastern niche. The icon is named official &quot;Phra Phut Chaloem Sirirat&quot;, but is commonly known as &quot;Phra Yok&quot;.

==Buildings==

Also on the temple grounds is the city pillar (&quot;Lak Mueang&quot;) of Chiang Mai, named &quot;Sao Inthakin&quot;. It was moved to this location in 1800 by King Chao Kawila; it was originally located in Wat Sadeu Muang. He also planted three dipterocarp tree there, which are supposed to assist the city pillar to protect the town. A festival in honor of the city pillar is held every year in May and lasts 6–8 days.

In a wihan near the entrance to the temple is the Buddha statue named &quot;Phra Chao Attarot&quot; (Eighteen-cubit Buddha), which was cast in the late 14th century. On the other side of the chedi is another pavilion housing a reclining Buddha statue.

Wat Chedi Luang hosts monk chats every day - tourists are invited to speak with monks (usually novices) and ask them anything about Buddhism or Thailand.

<text>The Chinese Basketball Association (), often abbreviated as the CBA, is the first-tier professional men&#x27;s basketball league in China.

The league is commonly known by fans as the CBA, and this acronym is even used in Chinese on a regular basis. The CBA should not be confused with the National Basketball League (NBL), which is a professional minor league. There is also a Women&#x27;s Chinese Basketball Association (WCBA).

A few Chinese players who competed in the CBA in the early stages of their careers—including Wang Zhizhi, Mengke Bateer, Yao Ming, Yi Jianlian, Sun Yue, and Zhou Qi—have also played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Others such as Xue Yuyang and Wang Zhelin were chosen in the draft, but have not played in the NBA.

Only a limited number of foreign players are allowed on each CBA team. Notable imports include former NBA All-Stars Stephon Marbury, Tracy McGrady, Gilbert Arenas, Steve Francis, Metta World Peace and Kenyon Martin—as well as several NBA veterans who would become CBA All-Stars—Michael Beasley, Aaron Brooks, Jimmer Fredette, Al Harrington, Lester Hudson, Randolph Morris, Shavlik Randolph, Jeremy Lin and J.R. Smith.

== Background ==
The CBA began play in the 1995–96 season. The league should not be confused with the Chinese Basketball Association (organisation), which was founded in June 1956 and represents the country in matters involving the sport&#x27;s governing body, FIBA. Basketball in China is currently regulated by the Chinese Basketball Management Center.

Other Chinese basketball leagues include the National Basketball League (NBL), the Chinese University Basketball Association (CUBA), and the Chinese High School Basketball League (CHBL). At one time there was a league called the Chinese New Basketball Alliance (CNBA), one of whose most prominent teams was the Beijing Sea Lions, but this venture lasted for just one winter (1996–97).

The first non-Chinese player to compete in the CBA was Mihail Savinkov of Uzbekistan, who joined the Zhejiang Squirrels in the league&#x27;s inaugural 1995–96 campaign. During the 1996–97 season, James Hodges became one of the first Americans to play in the CBA, and his signing by the Liaoning Hunters helped pave the way for many more imports from the United States to follow in the ensuing years.

Some other notable foreign pioneers included John Spencer, who joined the Jiangsu Dragons later in the 1996–97 campaign, and David Vanterpool, who inked a deal with the Jilin Northeast Tigers the following winter, and helped the team move up to the CBA in time for the 1998–99 season. The CBA&#x27;s first international coach was American Robert Hoggard, who led the Sichuan Pandas for the last eight games of the 1997–98 campaign.

== Team names ==
&quot;For a full list of teams, see Current clubs section below. Also see :Category:Chinese Basketball Association teams.&quot;

The full name of each team usually consists of three parts, in the following order:

# A geographic designation (except in the case of Bayi, which technically translates into English as &quot;August First,&quot; the day China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army was founded). All others are province-level designations (either a province or a Chinese municipality).
# A corporate sponsor name. This sponsor may change from year to year, and sometimes even in mid-season.
# A nickname, such as the name of an animal.

The presence of corporate sponsor names can occasionally lead to confusion about what name to use in English because many variants may be seen. Team names are usually abbreviated (in Chinese or English), so that either the corporate sponsor name or the nickname is used interchangeably (rarely both). In addition, team nicknames can sometimes be translated into English in more than one way, and corporate sponsors tend to change frequently over time.

Nickname changes are rare, but occasionally happen, such as when the Shandong team switched from &quot;Flaming Bulls&quot; (1995) to &quot;Lions&quot; (2003) to &quot;Gold Lions&quot; (2004) to &quot;Golden Stars&quot; (2014). Other examples include the Liaoning team dumping &quot;Hunters&quot; (1995) for &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; (2008) and then &quot;Flying Leopards&quot; (2011) -- as well as the Foshan team&#x27;s evolving attempts to &quot;Anglicize&quot; its nickname—by going from &quot;Kylins&quot; (2001) to &quot;Dralions&quot; to &quot;Long-Lions&quot;.

In previous years, the title of the league itself was available for corporate naming sponsorship. In 1999–2000 and 2000–2001 it was known as the &quot;Hilton League&quot;, in 2001–2002 and 2002–2003 it was the &quot;Motorola League&quot;, and in 2003–2004 it was sponsored by China Unicom. These corporate league titles were not always used in the news media, however, and this sponsorship practice was discontinued at the start of the 2004–2005 season.

== Current clubs ==
While clubs are listed by division here, the CBA does not use these designations for regular season purposes anymore, as each squad now plays each other once at home and once on the road (plus eight additional games within each of the four rotating &quot;strength of schedule&quot; sub-groupings). Divisions are used for the league&#x27;s annual All-Star Game, however, and are shown here for the sake of convenience.

=== Timeline ===
This is a chronological listing of current and former CBA teams according to the season that they entered the league.


== Finals ==
In 2005, the league unveiled the Mou Zuoyun Cup (), which was awarded for the first time to the winning team in the CBA Finals. Mou Zuoyun (1913–2007) was a member of the Chinese men&#x27;s national basketball team which competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics, and he later served as a coach and a pioneer in building Chinese basketball.

=== Finals appearances ===
This is a list of the teams which have advanced to the CBA Finals and the overall win–loss records they have registered in the Championship Series.

== Awards ==
The CBA Most Valuable Player award is presented to the league&#x27;s best player in a given CBA season. Since the 2012–13 campaign, two awards have been handed out each year, Domestic MVP and International MVP. The rules for the selection of the MVP in the regular season are: the number of games must reach 28 or more; The comprehensive score of individual technical indicators ranks among the best; The team won the top three in the regular season. At the conclusion of each season, the CBA Finals MVP award is bestowed upon the most outstanding player in that year&#x27;s championship series.

Each campaign&#x27;s scoring leader is also recognized on an annual basis and the league maintains a list of single game, single season, and career record holders in various statistical categories. Furthermore, a CBA All-Star Game MVP award is given to the player deemed to have the most impactful performance in the league&#x27;s annual mid-season exhibition contest.

The CBA Best Defender award is presented to the league&#x27;s most hard-skilled and efficient defender in a given season of the CBA.

==Scoring leaders==
The CBA&#x27;s highest single season scoring average, depending on how many games are required to be recognized as a statistical qualifier, is either 43.1 points per game by Jordan Crawford, who played in 26 of Tianjin&#x27;s 38 games (68.4%) in 2015–16, or 42.0 points per game by Jonathan Gibson, who played in 36 of Qingdao&#x27;s 38 games (94.7%) in 2015–16.

==Rebounding leaders==

==Politics==
On October 4, 2019, the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey issued a tweet in support of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Morey&#x27;s tweet resulted in the Chinese Basketball Association&#x27;s suspension of its relationship with the Houston Rockets and China Central Television&#x27;s removal of all NBA games from its broadcast schedule until further notice.

<text>Kenneth William David Hensley (24 August 1945 – 4 November 2020) was an English musician, singer, songwriter and producer, best known for his work with Uriah Heep during the 1970s.

He wrote or co-wrote the majority of Uriah Heep&#x27;s songs during this period, including the singles &quot;Lady in Black&quot; (on which he sang lead vocals), &quot;Easy Livin&#x27; and &quot;Stealin&#x27;, as well as &quot;Look at Yourself&quot; and &quot;Free Me&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Plumstead, south-east London, Hensley moved with his parents, three brothers and sister to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, in 1945. He learned how to play guitar at the age of 12 from a Bert Weedon manual. His first gig was at The Mentmore Pen Factory, in Stevenage (September 1960). After that, he played with The Blue Notes, Ken and the Cousins and Kit and the Saracens (1962). In 1963, this band evolved into The Jimmy Brown Sound, and they recorded some now lost songs. At this time, Hensley&#x27;s first &quot;professional&quot; opportunity almost came about: they were to back Ben E. King on a British visit, but it never happened.

In early 1965, Hensley formed a band called The Gods, with the young guitarist Mick Taylor, well known later for his work with John Mayall and The Rolling Stones. Hensley wrote most of the material, sang and played the Hammond B3 organ as the band already had Taylor on guitar. The Gods&#x27; line-up included, at one time or another, vocalist and guitar/bass player Greg Lake (later of King Crimson and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer), bass player Paul Newton (later the first Uriah Heep bassist), drummer Lee Kerslake (later also of Heep), bassist John Glascock (later of Jethro Tull), and guitarist Joe Konas. In early 1968, they signed with Columbia Records and recorded two LPs and several singles.

Hensley also then played on a one-album side project of The Gods initially planned to become their third album, but was recorded and eventually released in 1969/1970 under the moniker Head Machine&#x27;s &quot;Orgasm&quot;. The album was produced by David Paramor (producer of &quot;The Gods&quot;) and both Hensley and Kerslake featured, along with John Glascock on bass, Brian Glascock on drums, and David Paramor on vocals, all under pseudonyms. Hensley played mostly guitar again, as in the beginning of his career. Although Paramor was credited as composer, the songs bear many of Hensley&#x27;s influences. The album was released before Hensley joined Toe Fat, and might almost be considered a prototype for the harder side of his future work in Uriah Heep.

The band eventually split but Cliff Bennett, from the Rebel Rousers, decided to move in a more &quot;progressive&quot; direction and asked The Gods to join him. Under the name Toe Fat they released two LPs, but only the first featured Hensley.

Paul Newton asked Hensley (Christmas 1969) to join forces in Spice, as they were looking for a keyboard player to make their sound less bluesy and more progressive, in keeping with the current trend. In January 1970, Spice changed its name into Uriah Heep. Also in the line-up were guitarist Mick Box and vocalist David Byron. With Uriah Heep, Hensley found a place to develop and showcase his songwriting and lyrical abilities as well as his keyboard and guitar playing. 

The band&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; line-up featured Hensley, Byron, Box, Kerslake and bassist Gary Thain, plus the management provided by Gerry Bron (Bronze Records). During his time with Heep (1970–1980), they recorded 13 studio albums, and the live album &quot;Uriah Heep Live – January 1973&quot; along with many compilations and singles. Hensley also recorded his first two solo albums, &quot;Proud Words on a Dusty Shelf&quot; (1973) and &quot;Eager To Please&quot; (1975) during this time. He was supported mainly by Mark Clarke and Bugs Pemberton.

After the departure of bassist Gary Thain (who died in 1975) and vocalist David Byron, other musicians were brought into the Heep family: John Wetton (Family, King Crimson, Roxy Music, later of U.K. and Asia), Trevor Bolder (from Spiders From Mars, later of Wishbone Ash) and John Lawton (Lucifer&#x27;s Friend), among others.

In 1980 Hensley left the band, unhappy with the musical direction they had chosen. After trying to put a new band together in the UK (Shotgun), he later moved to the US and played a few gigs in North America as The Ken Hensley Band. Around this time he released his third solo LP, &quot;Free Spirit&quot; (1980).

In 1982, Hensley joined Blackfoot, a hard rock Florida-based band. With them, he recorded two albums (1983&#x27;s &quot;Siogo&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Vertical Smiles&quot;). Although the group achieved some success, Hensley left after Bron informed him of Heep vocalist David Byron&#x27;s death in 1985.

After 1985, Hensley lived in semi-retirement in St Louis, Missouri (US), making a few appearances with W.A.S.P., Cinderella and others. W.A.S.P.&#x27;s frontman Blackie Lawless stated that &quot;Ken Hensley wrote the rule book for heavy metal keyboards as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot; Hensley also owned &quot;The Attic&quot; Recording studio in St. Louis.

In 1994, &quot;From Time To Time&quot;, a collection of lost recordings, was released featuring rare songs recorded by Hensley between 1971 and 1982, as well as some early versions of Heep&#x27;s classic songs, played by Hensley and his roommates at that time, namely guitarist Paul Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke (both of Free). Other musicians on the songs were bassist Boz Burrell (King Crimson and Bad Company), guitarist Mick Ralphs (Mott the Hoople, Bad Company), drummers Ian Paice (Deep Purple, Whitesnake) and Kenney Jones (The Small Faces, The Faces, The Who), amongst others.

IIn 1997 Ken established The Upper Room Studios in St. Louis, Missouri where Ken was involved with several projects including &quot;A Glimpse of Glory&quot;, together with his band Visible Faith produced by Ken and engineered by chief engineer Bud Martin. In 1999, Hensley&#x27;s musical activities began to increase, besides his work with St Louis Music. He recorded an album, 

During the fourth Uriah Heep Annual Convention in London, May 2000, plans were made for a one-off concert by the so-called &quot;Hensley/Lawton Band&quot;. Hensley was joined by former Uriah Heep singer John Lawton, their first public collaboration since the latter&#x27;s departure from Uriah Heep in 1979. With them were Paul Newton (the band&#x27;s original bassist) and two members of Lawton&#x27;s band, Reuben Kane on lead guitar and Justin Shefford on drums. They played a set of old Uriah Heep classics and some of Hensley&#x27;s solo songs, and the concert was recorded for a CD release, followed by an extensive tour of Europe during Spring and Summer of 2001 culminating with a concert on 12 May in Hamburg, Germany, featuring a full orchestra and a new rendition of Heep&#x27;s old classic song &quot;Salisbury&quot;. After the tour, both Ken and John returned to their respective solo careers. 

On 7 December 2001, both John Lawton and Ken Hensley appeared on stage with Uriah Heep during the annual Magician&#x27;s Birthday Party at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London. This concert was recorded and released as a CD/DVD.

&quot;Running Blind&quot;, his first effort in 21 years, was released worldwide in 2002 and followed by a world tour with his band called &quot;Free Spirit&quot;, that included Dave Kilminster (guitar), Andy Pyle (bass) and Pete Riley (drums).

After moving to Spain, Hensley released &quot;The Last Dance&quot; (with new songs), &quot;The Wizard&#x27;s Diary&quot; (Uriah Heep classics re-recorded in 2004) and &quot;Cold Autumn Sunday&quot; (Hensley&#x27;s solo songs re-recorded in 2005).

Featuring a number of special guests, the rock opera &quot;Blood on the Highway&quot; was released in May 2007. The story portrays the rise and fall of a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll star. Lead vocals role were split between Hensley and Glenn Hughes (ex-Deep Purple, Trapeze, Black Sabbath), Jørn Lande (ex-The Snakes, Masterplan), John Lawton and Eve Gallagher.

In September 2008, Hensley went on stage again with former Heep bandmates Lawton, Kerslake and Newton along with ex-Focus guitarist Jan Dumée, for the &quot;Heepvention 2008&quot; fans meeting.

Hensley continued to write and record a series of new albums, beginning with a collection of songs under the title of &quot;Love &amp; Other Mysteries&quot;, recorded near his home in Spain and followed in 2011 by &quot;Faster&quot;, his first studio recording of new songs with his live band, Live Fire. A CD of one of his solo concerts was released by Cherry Red Records in 2013, shortly followed by a live CD recorded with Live Fire during a September/October tour. &quot;Trouble&quot;, an album of 10 new songs recorded with a revised Live Fire line-up, was released, again by Cherry Red, in September the same year.

In later years, Hensley and his wife Monica lived in the village of Agost near Alicante in Spain.

Hensley died on 4 November 2020, at the age of 75 following a short illness. He had finished an album titled &quot;My Book of Answers&quot; before his death, that was released on 5 March 2021.
