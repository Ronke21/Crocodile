<text>The following is a list of [[Hogwarts]] staff in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books written by J. K. Rowling.

== The staff and their positions ==
== Teachers and staff members ==
The following teachers and staff members do not have their own articles or are not listed in other articles.

=== Argus Filch ===
Argus Filch is the caretaker of Hogwarts. He is ill-tempered, which makes him unpopular with the student body, and occasionally causes tension or exasperation with teachers and other staff. His knowledge of the secrets and short-cuts of the castle is almost unparalleled, except perhaps by the users of the Marauder&#x27;s Map (the Weasley twins, Harry, Ron and Hermione), and Voldemort himself. He tends to favour almost sadistically harsh punishments, and gleefully allies himself with Umbridge when she prescribes such punishments on students. He has an obsessive dislike of mud, animate toys, and all other things that might interfere with his desire for an immaculately clean and orderly Hogwarts. He is also portrayed as having a constant antagonism towards Peeves the poltergeist and often tells Dumbledore that Peeves should be thrown out of Hogwarts. He also likes to wander Hogwarts&#x27; corridors at night, presumably in the hope of catching a student breaking a curfew.

Filch is revealed to be a Squib in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; when Harry accidentally discovers that he is trying to teach himself basic magic from a &quot;Kwikspell&quot; correspondence course. Nonetheless, Filch is at least able to use wizarding devices that have their own innate magic, such as the Secrecy Sensor used in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. It is hinted that his dislike of students may stem from his disappointment and jealousy at not being able to do magic. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, the final book, when the school starts preparing itself for the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch is seen yelling that students are out of bed. He is later seen overseeing the evacuation of younger students.

Filch has a cat named Mrs Norris to whom he has a particular and possessive attachment. She acts as a hallway monitor or spy for Filch. If she observes students engaging in suspicious activity or not in a common room after curfew, she finds Filch and he arrives in seconds. She has been known to follow Hagrid everywhere he goes in the school, apparently under Filch&#x27;s orders. According to J.K. Rowling, there is nothing particularly magical about Mrs Norris, other than her being &quot;just an intelligent (and unpleasant) cat.&quot; It&#x27;s the ambition of many Hogwarts students to &quot;give her a good kick&quot;. In the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; incident, Mrs Norris is temporarily petrified by the Basilisk, which causes Filch extreme distress.

David Bradley portrays Filch in the film series. Mrs Norris was played by three Maine Coon cats named Maximus, Alanis, and Cornilusa.

=== Filius Flitwick ===
Filius Flitwick is the Charms Master at Hogwarts and the head of Ravenclaw house. He is a very short, dwarf-like man. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; he uses his magical skills to help decorate the Great Hall for Christmas. He is also one of the teachers who cast spells to guard the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone by putting charms on a hundred keys so they can fly, making it difficult to find the key to the door leading to the next chamber.

During Harry&#x27;s second year, Flitwick helps Professor Sinistra carry a petrified Justin Finch-Fletchley to the hospital wing. He teaches the front doors to recognise a picture of Sirius after his second break-in in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, and to instantly lock down if he tries to break in. He helps patrol the perimeter of the maze for the third task of the Triwizard Tournament held in Harry&#x27;s fourth year. He eventually removes most of the swamp that is created within the school by Fred and George in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, though he previously leaves the swamp untouched to annoy Umbridge. He does however choose to leave a small patch of it behind, because he thinks it is &quot;a good bit of magic&quot; and a tribute to the Weasley twins. Near the end of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Flitwick is sent by Professor McGonagall to ask Professor Snape to come to the aid of the Order of the Phoenix against the intruding Death Eaters. He collapses after requesting Snape&#x27;s help at the battle.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Flitwick insists that Rowena Ravenclaw&#x27;s Diadem is lost, and he is described by Harry (along with Dumbledore) as having been a &quot;model student&quot; who supposedly never entered the Room of Hidden Things, and so it never occurred to him that the diadem could be hidden there. Before the Battle of Hogwarts, Flitwick helps to chase Severus Snape out of the Hogwarts castle alongside professors McGonagall and Sprout, and to put protective charms around the castle to hinder Voldemort and his oncoming Death Eaters, and later fights the intruders in the battle, battling Corban Yaxley and later defeating Antonin Dolohov.

In the film adaptations, Flitwick is portrayed by Warwick Davis. Rowling said: &quot;I must admit, I was taken aback when I saw the film. Flitwick, who looks very much like a goblin/elf (I&#x27;ve never actually asked the film-makers precisely what he is), because the Flitwick in my imagination simply looks like a very small old man.&quot; Rowling mentions on her official website that Flitwick is human, with &quot;a dash of goblin ancestry.&quot; His on-screen appearance changes noticeably in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, in which he takes on a more human and less elf-like look, with slicked-down dark hair and moustache. According to Davis, the moustachioed character was originally not supposed to be Flitwick; Flitwick was absent from the script for &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, but &quot;the producer&quot; (presumably David Heyman) added the new character (as the conductor of the school choir and orchestra, credited as &quot;Choir Master&quot;) so that Davis could still appear in the film. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; director Mike Newell preferred the new look, &quot;and from that moment, the character became known as &#x27;Flitwick&#x27;.&quot; Flitwick was born on 17 October.

=== Gilderoy Lockhart ===
Gilderoy Lockhart is a popular author and wizarding celebrity who has written many books about his adventures encountering dark creatures and serves as the Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor for &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. He is unpopular with most of the staff, particularly Snape, for his endless self-promotion and penchant for publicity stunts. He is greatly admired by many others, particularly women (including Hermione and Molly Weasley) due to his intense charisma. Harry dislikes Lockhart for a number of reasons: his arrogance, his belief that Harry flew to Hogwarts in Mr. Weasley&#x27;s car to seek further attention, his constantly forcing Harry to partake in his antics, and the trouble he has with simple magic such as healing Harry&#x27;s broken arm (he accidentally vanishes Harry&#x27;s arm bones instead). Lockhart is exposed as a charlatan and a coward when he attempts to avoid entering the Chamber of Secrets by revealing to Harry and Ron that he never performed the amazing feats documented in his books; he simply passed off the feats of other wizards and witches as his own and erased their memories to hide the truth. He attempts to do the same to Harry and Ron, but Harry disarms him. Lockhart then steals Ron&#x27;s damaged wand, but the Memory Charm he casts backfires and leaves him with permanent amnesia; arrangements are made for him to be institutionalized until his memory can be fixed.

In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Harry comes across Lockhart in St Mungo&#x27;s while visiting Arthur Weasley at Christmas. Lockhart has not recovered any of his memories but is childishly proud of being able to write in &quot;joined-up letters&quot;. He still enjoys signing autographs and continues to receive fan mail, although he has no idea why. For his part, Harry feels a slight twinge of guilt for Lockhart&#x27;s amnesia (especially since it becomes clear that St. Mungo&#x27;s has given up on trying to undo the damage) but he consoles himself with the fact that it was Lockhart&#x27;s own fault that he is now reduced to a child-like mentality.

Rowling has said Lockhart is the only character she has ever based on a real-life person. Lockhart was inspired by an unrevealed acquaintance who was &quot;even more objectionable than his fictional counterpart&quot; and &quot;used to tell whopping great fibs about his past life, all of them designed to demonstrate what a wonderful, brave and brilliant person he was.&quot;

Kenneth Branagh portrayed Lockhart in the film version of &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. In an end-credits scene, his latest book is on sale in Diagon Alley; titled &quot;Who Am I?&quot;, it displays a picture of him humming distractedly to himself and wearing a straitjacket.

=== Poppy Pomfrey ===
Madam Poppy Pomfrey is the sole magical Healer of the Hogwarts hospital wing. She is loyal, highly skilled, non-inquisitive and tight-lipped about her patients, and very strict regarding the rules of her infirmary.

Harry ends up under her care rather often. In &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, he spends three days unconscious in the hospital wing after the confrontation with Professor Quirrell. In &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, he spends one painful night regrowing bones in his arm, after Gilderoy Lockhart vanishes them, much to Pomfrey&#x27;s vexation. In &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, she tends to Harry twice; once after the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff and once after the Shrieking Shack incident. She speaks approvingly of Lupin&#x27;s prescription of chocolate to alleviate the effects of a dementor&#x27;s presence on students, commenting that Hogwarts has &quot;finally got a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies&quot;. In &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, she treats Harry twice; once for a dragon strike and once after the confrontation with Voldemort. In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, she tends to Harry after his skull is cracked by a Bludger in a Quidditch match.

Others who end up under her care expose more of her personality. In &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Hermione ends up in the hospital wing for a month after a mishap with the Polyjuice Potion leaves her half-feline. Pomfrey is careful to keep this a secret. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, after Umbridge&#x27;s henchmen stun McGonagall, Madam Pomfrey says she would resign in protest were she not afraid of what would become of the students without her presence. In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, she attempts to heal Bill of his scars from Greyback&#x27;s attack without much success, and bursts into tears when she hears of Dumbledore&#x27;s death. In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, she and Filch oversee the evacuation of Hogwarts before the battle. She is later seen tending to the injured fighters.

Gemma Jones appeared as Madam Pomfrey in the film adaptations of &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, &quot;Half Blood Prince&quot;, and &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;.

=== Quirinus Quirrell ===
Quirinus Quirrell is the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts during Harry&#x27;s first year and secretly a follower of Voldemort. Before his employment at Hogwarts, he is said by Hagrid to have had a &quot;brilliant mind&quot; and been a skilled teacher; some time before Harry&#x27;s arrival at Hogwarts, &quot;he took a year off to get some first-hand experience&quot; after learning mostly from books. Rowling stated in a live web chat on 30 July 2007 that Quirrell had worked at Hogwarts as professor of Muggle Studies for a certain length of time, before taking the cursed Defence Against the Dark Arts position in the same year that Harry joined. There were rumours that he encountered vampires in the Black Forest and one in Romania, and he apparently had &quot;a nasty bit of trouble with a hag&quot;. After that, he was &#x27;never the same&#x27; – upon his return, he appears perpetually nervous and has developed a stutter and nervous tics and Hagrid was able to say even before the beginning of the autumn term that he was &quot;scared of the students, scared of his own subject&quot;. Quirrell&#x27;s attire includes a new purple turban which he claims to have received as a reward from an African prince for getting rid of a troublesome zombie. Fred and George constantly joke that the turban was full of garlic to ward away vampires and in one part they even enchant snowballs to hit it.

Harry first meets Quirrell at the Leaky Cauldron, while being escorted by Hagrid to Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies. Quirrell is next seen at Hogwarts conversing with Snape at the start-of-term banquet, and then regularly while teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons. During the school&#x27;s Halloween banquet, Quirrell appears in the Great Hall to warn staff and students of a troll in the dungeons and then he faints, so he can freely make his way to the third-floor corridor where the Stone is hidden. Snape who, apparently, already suspected Quirrell was up to something, goes to the third floor in order to stop him. In later novels, the readers learn that Dumbledore had told Snape to keep an eye on the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Quirrell is unable to get to the Stone, but in the process, Snape is bitten by Fluffy. When Harry and his friends see that Snape has been bitten, they begin to suspect Snape is after the Stone for himself. While playing Quidditch, Harry is almost thrown off his broom by some sort of curse and he, Ron, and Hermione believe it is Snape who is responsible. They begin to suspect that Snape is trying to steal the Stone hidden in a secret chamber in Hogwarts; when Harry finally arrives in the chamber, he discovers that it is not Snape, but Quirrell who is the real villain.

During his European travels, Quirrell discovered the barely alive Voldemort, who had been in hiding since his failed bid to kill Harry as an infant. Quirrell became attracted to Voldemort&#x27;s offers of power and returned to Britain with the Dark Lord. Quirrell addresses and refers to Voldemort by that name, rather than &quot;The Dark Lord&quot; as other Death Eaters do. Initially, Voldemort allowed Quirrell to act autonomously – Quirrell was able to shake hands with Harry in the Leaky Cauldron, and was not wearing the turban, meaning that Voldemort was not possessing him (though this changes in the film version, where Quirrell wears the turban at the Leaky Cauldron and refuses to shake Harry&#x27;s hand). Voldemort first used Quirrell in a plan to steal the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone from its vault in Gringotts Bank, where it had been deposited for safekeeping by Dumbledore. But Dumbledore had already sent Hagrid on a mission to retrieve the Stone, which he did while he and Harry were shopping in Diagon Alley, after they met with Quirrell in the Leaky Cauldron.

Voldemort, as punishment for Quirrell&#x27;s failure to secure the Stone from Gringotts, decided to keep a closer watch on his new servant. He took possession of Quirrell&#x27;s body, which caused his face to appear on the back of Quirrell&#x27;s bald head. To conceal this, Quirrell took to wearing the turban. To keep Voldemort alive, Quirrell had to kill unicorns in the Forbidden Forest, drinking their blood to provide temporary life-sustaining powers for Voldemort. Quirrell then reveals that he was the one who let in the troll and attempted to throw Harry off his broom while Snape muttered a counter curse. He also admits that his stutter was faked so he would appear harmless and thus avoid suspicion.

During the climax of the story, as Harry and Quirrell try to recover the Stone from the Mirror of Erised, Voldemort reveals himself on the back of Quirrell&#x27;s head, formerly concealed by the turban, and speaks directly to Harry, threatening to kill him if he does not assist Voldemort in recovering it. After Harry refuses, Quirrell tries to take the Stone by force. Voldemort orders Quirrell to use a killing curse on Harry, who holds off Quirrell long enough for Dumbledore to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees in his non-physical form. Voldemort&#x27;s departure, as well as the agony suffered by him because of his contact with Harry, who continues to be protected by the love of his mother and the spell that was cast by her sacrificing her life, causes Quirrell to die, hence Dumbledore&#x27;s comment that Voldemort is as merciless to his followers as to his enemies.

Before he dies, Quirrell tells Harry of the rivalry between his father, the late James Potter, and Snape: &quot;Didn&#x27;t you know? Snape went to school with your father. They loathed each other.&quot;

The film version&#x27;s climax ends a little differently. Voldemort does not threaten Harry but instead tries to tempt him with a false promise of resurrecting his parents. Harry is not fooled, but when Quirrell attempts to strangle him to death, Harry&#x27;s blood protection, which was provided by his mother&#x27;s sacrifice of her own life to save him, enables Harry to kill Quirrell himself. Harry discovers that when he comes into direct contact with Quirrell, it immediately produces a burning effect. Harry puts both his hands on Quirrell, who burns into crumbling ash. The spirit form of Voldemort renders Harry unconscious before making his escape.

Though Quirrell&#x27;s first name was never mentioned in the novels, the character is given the first name &quot;Quirinus&quot; in the official Harry Potter Trading Card Game. He is also noted for being one of the few characters in the original stories to not use a wand, as he manages to restrain Harry with magical ropes by simply snapping his fingers.

British actor Ian Hart portrayed Quirrell in the film adaptation of the book.

=== Horace Slughorn ===
Horace Slughorn is the long-serving Potions teacher and Head of Slytherin House since at least the 1940s, until his retirement after the 1981–82 school year. Following his retirement and the resurgence of Voldemort, Slughorn goes into hiding, concealing all knowledge of his whereabouts from both sides in the growing conflict in the wizarding world. After moving Snape to Defence Against the Dark Arts, Dumbledore locates Slughorn and uses Harry as incentive to convince him to return to teaching Potions. Slughorn is described as preferring to be a &quot;back-seat driver&quot;, obtaining things he desires by using his contacts, particularly students whom he has invited into the &quot;Slug Club&quot;, a group of students favoured by Slughorn, based either on their connections to important people (a type of cronyism) or on his belief that they have talents that will make them important and famous themselves when they leave school (meritocracy). He is one of the first Slytherin characters to defy the house&#x27;s stereotype and being portrayed in a somewhat positive light: while he is self-serving and not above bending rules, he lacks the near-amorality and underhandedness that had, until that point, been a hallmark of the house. He does not resent blood status in general, and admits a pleasurable surprise when he comes upon a talented Muggle-born, such as Hermione or, years before, Harry&#x27;s mother Lily Potter, one of his all-time favourite pupils. Also, Slughorn notably displays not pride, but shame at having helped a young Tom Marvolo Riddle perform some of his most noted and impressive feats of magic, as Riddle had questioned Slughorn about Horcruxes. Students he deems unimportant he ignores, as though they were not there.

In &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Harry is invited to the first meeting of the Slug Club held on the Hogwarts Express. Slughorn sets less-stringent entry criteria for Advanced Potions than his predecessor, lowering the required grade from a perfect O (Outstanding) to the above-average E (Exceeds Expectations). This last-minute change enables Harry and Ron to take Potions at NEWT level. Since Harry had not expected to be allowed to join the course, he has none of the necessary materials, and Slughorn lends him an old textbook until Harry can procure his own. Later, Harry does buy a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making from Flourish and Blotts, but switches the covers and gives back the new book. During his first class, Slughorn offers a small amount of Felix Felicis to the student who brews the best cauldron of the Draught of Living Death. Harry wins with the help of handwritten notes in the borrowed textbook, which, unbeknownst to him, had once belonged to Snape. When Ron falls victim to a high-strength love potion, Slughorn administers an antidote, but then nearly kills him with a drink of poisoned mead, not knowing that the bottle had been planted by Draco Malfoy in an attempt to kill Dumbledore. Harry later uses the Felix Felicis to help retrieve a memory from Slughorn that details the conversation between the professor and Riddle about Horcruxes as well as the possibility of creating more than one Horcrux.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Slughorn briefly appears with other teachers assembling to fight Death Eaters. As Snape is now Headmaster, Slughorn has again assumed the post of Head of Slytherin. Though he is initially hesitant to join in the Battle of Hogwarts and is assumed to have evacuated with his house, he returns to the fray later on. It is revealed that he has not fled, but has recruited a large number of reinforcements to fight for Hogwarts. He then summons up the courage to duel Voldemort, alongside McGonagall and Kingsley Shacklebolt.

Slughorn is played by Jim Broadbent in the film adaptations of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;.

=== Pomona Sprout ===
Pomona Sprout is Professor of Herbology and the Head of Hufflepuff House. She is described as a dumpy little witch with flyaway grey hair who wears a patched, frayed hat and shabby robes, often covered in dirt due to the time she spends tending plants in the Hogwarts greenhouses. Sprout is introduced in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, but she plays no active role until &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, in which she teaches her second year students to work with Mandrake plants. She is responsible for raising the Mandrakes to full maturity, at which point their juice is used to revive the petrified victims of the basilisk.

Sprout subsequently appears in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; in which, as the Hufflepuff Head of House, she comforts Amos Diggory and his wife after the death of their son, Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory, whom she knew well. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Sprout is a non-vocal supporter of Harry&#x27;s story about Voldemort&#x27;s resurrection. Like many teachers at Hogwarts, she detests Umbridge&#x27;s presence and does her best to disobey her. After the raid of Hogwarts in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Sprout is a staunch advocate of keeping Hogwarts open. She also supports the suggestion that Dumbledore should be laid to rest at Hogwarts. Sprout attends Dumbledore&#x27;s funeral, where she appears cleaner than she has ever been seen before.

In &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, she chases Snape away from Hogwarts with Professors McGonagall and Flitwick. Informed that Voldemort and his Death Eaters are coming to besiege Hogwarts, she uses her knowledge of magical plants by improvising offensive botany, and, with the help of several students, throws Mandrakes, Snargaluff pods, and Venomous Tentaculas off the castle walls at the approaching Death Eaters. The epilogue of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; reveals that Neville has become the new Herbology teacher at Hogwarts. The circumstances of Sprout&#x27;s departure from the job are not revealed.

Sprout was portrayed by Miriam Margolyes in the film adaptation of &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;.

=== Sybill Trelawney ===

Sybill Patricia Trelawney is the Divination teacher. She is the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer, Cassandra Trelawney, and has inherited some of her ancestor&#x27;s talent. Trelawney is described as a slight woman resembling an insect, draped in a large spangled shawl and many gaudy bangles and rings. She speaks in a whispy voice and wears thick glasses, which cause her eyes to appear greatly magnified. Her odd classroom in the North Tower of Hogwarts is a cross between &quot;someone&#x27;s attic and an old-fashioned tea shop&quot;; it can only be reached by climbing to the top of the stairs and then up a ladder through a trapdoor set in the ceiling. This dim, heavily scented, and &quot;stiflingly&quot; warm room often affects students&#x27; wakefulness.

Trelawney first appears in the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start Divination lessons. The friends generally believe Trelawney is a fraud. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, the death of one of her students, she uses it as a greeting for her class. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of what she is saying, with no memory of it afterward. Almost all her predictions were later shown to be true in the books even if she was not in a trance.

Before the events of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, Trelawney falls into a prophetic trance during an interview with Dumbledore at the Hog&#x27;s Head, making a prophecy about the birth of a wizard &quot;with the power to vanquish&quot; the dark lord, Voldemort. This prophecy is partly overheard by Snape, who relays what he heard to Voldemort. This leads Voldemort to attack the Potter family, believing that Harry was the child named.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, Trelawney erroneously predicts that Harry was born around Midwinter, even though he was born on 31 July, with it later being revealed that this slip-up was because Trelawney was unknowingly reading the piece of Voldemort&#x27;s soul within Harry. She also accurately prophesies to Harry about the events of the book&#x27;s climax, including Peter Pettigrew&#x27;s return to Voldemort&#x27;s side.

In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Trelawney is first put on probation by Umbridge, and later fired. Dumbledore intervenes to allow Trelawney to stay in the castle, as he believes that she would be in danger outside Hogwarts due to the prophecy she made during her interview, and recruits Firenze from the centaur herd in the Forbidden Forest to replace her as a way of spiting Umbridge. Dumbledore later reveals that the prophecy is why he keeps her employed as a Divination teacher. After Umbridge is ousted, Trelawney returns to teaching in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, but has to share classes with Firenze, as he was cast out by his fellow centaurs when he agreed to replace Trelawney after she was fired, which she thinks is an outrage. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, she is seen aiding in the Battle of Hogwarts by magically accelerating her crystal balls at Death Eaters. She uses one of these crystal balls to defend an injured Lavender against an attack by Fenrir Greyback. In the film adaptation, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, she is seen covering someone&#x27;s body, with the aid of Padma Patil.

In the British editions of the books, her name is consistently spelled as &quot;Sybill&quot;. In the American editions, from her first appearance in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; through &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, her name is spelled as &quot;Sibyll&quot;. However, in the American edition of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, it is re-spelled as &quot;Sybill&quot;, matching the UK edition. The name &quot;Sybill&quot; is a reference to Greek and Roman prophet priestesses, while Cassandra refers to the Trojan seer Cassandra, whose doom was that her prophecies would never be believed.

Professor Trelawney is portrayed by Emma Thompson in the &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;Deathly Hallows Part 2&quot;. In the movies, Sybill Trelawny wears many accessories like scarfs, bracelets, and bangles. Trelawney tries to appear as mysterious, but often ends up seeming dramatic. She keeps giving vague prophecies to students such as Lavender, whose rabbit dies, and Neville, who often breaks cups and is late to class.

== Hogwarts ghosts ==
Hogwarts houses have at least twenty ghosts, but when people in the novels speak of the ghosts at Hogwarts they usually refer to one of the four resident ghosts of the Hogwarts houses: Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington (or, as the students refer to him, Nearly Headless Nick), the almost beheaded ghost of Gryffindor house; the Bloody Baron, who is the ghost of Slytherin house; the jovial Fat Friar, who is the ghost of Hufflepuff house; and the Grey Lady, who in life was Helena Ravenclaw, the ghost of Ravenclaw house. These ghosts seem to act as something like advisers and aides to the students; Nick frequently helps Harry during moments of uncertainty or crisis.

Despite animosity between the houses, their respective ghosts get along well with each other. Nearly Headless Nick is respectful of the Bloody Baron and claims that he cannot imagine starting a fight with him, while the Fat Friar pleads on behalf of Peeves the Poltergeist to allow him to come to the welcome feasts despite his past wrongdoings. During &quot;The Deathly Hallows&quot;, Nick is protective of Helena and only reluctantly tells Harry how to find her.

=== The Bloody Baron ===
The Bloody Baron is the Slytherin House ghost. He is the only person besides Dumbledore and Fred and George Weasley who can exert any control over the poltergeist Peeves; Peeves is terrified of him for some unknown reason, referring to him as &quot;Your Bloodiness&quot; and &quot;Mr Baron&quot;.

The Baron&#x27;s nickname comes from the fact that he is covered with blood, which appears silvery on his ghostly form. When Nearly Headless Nick is asked in the first book why the Baron is so bloody, Nick delicately comments that &quot;he has never asked&quot;. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Helena Ravenclaw (the Grey Lady) explains to Harry that the Baron had been in love with her when the two were alive, and when she ran off with her mother&#x27;s diadem, Rowena Ravenclaw sent the Baron after her, knowing he would not stop until Helena was found. When Helena refused to return with him, the Baron killed her in a fit of rage, and then, in remorse, killed himself with the same weapon. He has thus haunted Hogwarts ever since, wearing his ghostly chains as a form of penance.

Terence Bayler portrayed the Baron in the first film. In contrast to his book counterpart, the Baron is mirthful in the film, playfully swiping through the Sorting feast with his sword, much to the amusement of those within his house.

=== The Fat Friar ===
The Fat Friar is the Hufflepuff House ghost. He is a jolly man and very forgiving, frequently suggesting that Peeves be given another chance, or forgiven for any mishaps.

Simon Fisher-Becker appeared as the Fat Friar in the film adaptation of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;.

=== The Grey Lady ===
The Grey Lady is the Ravenclaw House ghost. According to a letter written by Rowling to Nina Young, the actress who played the Grey Lady in the first film, she is &quot;a highly intellectual young lady ... She never found true love as she never found a man up to her standards&quot;.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; reveals that the Grey Lady is Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, making her the only house ghost known to be related to one of the Hogwarts founders. She informs Harry that she stole the Diadem of Ravenclaw from her mother, in an attempt to become smarter than her, and then went into hiding in Albania. It was a dying Rowena Ravenclaw&#x27;s wish to see her daughter again, and so she sent for the Bloody Baron to look for her, knowing that he would not rest until he brought her back, partly because he was in unrequited love with her. However, she refused to come with the Baron and, in a moment of blind rage, he killed her with a single stab-wound to the chest. Overcome with remorse, the Bloody Baron killed himself using the same weapon in turn and wears chains as penitence, &quot;as he should&quot;, the Grey Lady says. The diadem remained in the hollow of a tree in an Albanian forest until Tom Riddle managed to charm the story out of the Grey Lady. Riddle, who had been seeking historically significant objects to make into Horcruxes, later retrieved the diadem from Albania and hid it in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts while visiting the castle years later.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Nina Young played the Grey Lady, and in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, she was played by Kelly Macdonald.

=== Nearly Headless Nick ===
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington KG, often referred to as Nearly Headless Nick, Nick, or Sir Nicholas, is the Gryffindor House ghost who in life was sentenced to death by beheading after a teeth-straightening spell went awry on Lady Grieve. However, the executioner&#x27;s axe was blunt and Nick&#x27;s head was still attached to his neck by a thin strip of skin after 45 chops. Harry becomes friends with Nick when he attends his &quot;deathday&quot; party (the 500th anniversary of the event) in a Hogwarts dungeon. Nick&#x27;s death date (31 October 1492) had the distinction of having served as the basis for the entire chronology of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; stories, until the timeline was confirmed by James and Lily&#x27;s headstone in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;. His greatest wish is to become a member of the Headless Hunt, as mentioned in the second book. He is excluded due to the fact that he is not actually headless (&quot;he is nearly headless&quot;) and would never be completely able to participate in the activities (such as &quot;Head Polo&quot;).

In &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Nick is a victim of the Basilisk that Ginny Weasley unleashes under the influence of Tom Riddle. The stare of the Basilisk is lethal to anyone who looks it directly in the eye. All of its living victims meet its gaze indirectly, either from a reflection or by seeing it through something else, and are only petrified rather than killed. Nick is the only one to look directly at the Basilisk, but he too is petrified since he is a ghost and cannot die again. Nick also protected Hufflepuff student Justin Finch-Fletchley from death after Justin saw the basilisk&#x27;s eyes through Nick&#x27;s transparent body, thus only petrifying him as well.

The character appears again in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; when Harry has been looking for comfort upon Sirius&#x27; death, hoping he can see him later as a ghost. Nick explains that only witches and wizards who fear death and refuse to go on can become ghosts, dashing Harry&#x27;s hope of communicating with Sirius. He appears briefly in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, when Harry asks Nick to bring him to the Grey Lady.

The character also appears in the 2023 video game &quot;Hogwarts Legacy&quot; as a non-playable character.

The character was portrayed in the film series by John Cleese, though he only appears in the first two films.

== Hogwarts founders ==
Hogwarts was founded a millennium ago (the exact date unknown) by &quot;four of the greatest witches and wizards of the age&quot;: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. The founders served as Hogwarts&#x27; first teachers, and each of the Hogwarts houses is named after one of the founders.

=== Godric Gryffindor ===
Godric Gryffindor was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was good friends with Salazar Slytherin but they had conflicting ideas as Salazar believed no Muggle-borns should be accepted into Hogwarts. &quot;Godric Gryffindor was the most accomplished dueller of his time and an enlightened fighter against Muggle-discrimination&quot;.

His known relics are a goblin-made sword adorned with rubies, known as The Sword of Gryffindor; and the Sorting Hat. The two items share a particular bond: whenever a Gryffindor student is in a time of need, the sword will present itself within the Sorting Hat. In his second year, Harry Potter pulled the sword out of the hat when he was in need of a weapon in the Chamber of Secrets. Gryffindor is said to have praised courage, determination and strength of heart above all other qualities. He also was the most accepting of allowing Muggle-borns into the school.

=== Helga Hufflepuff ===
Helga Hufflepuff, the founder of Hufflepuff; came from a broad valley. The Sorting Hat describes her as &quot;good Hufflepuff&quot; or &quot;sweet Hufflepuff&quot;. She favoured loyalty, honesty, and dedication. In &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, she is said to have considered &quot;hard workers almost always most worthy of admission&quot;. Elsewhere, she is described as taking &quot;all the rest&quot; of the students after selection by her colleagues. She was a good friend of Rowena Ravenclaw; their friendship is used to emphasize the failed friendship between Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin.

&quot;One of the four celebrated Founders of Hogwarts, Hufflepuff was particularly famous for her dexterity at food-related Charms. Many recipes traditionally served at Hogwarts feasts originated with Hufflepuff.&quot; Her wizard card, penned by Rowling, describes her as having &quot;brought people from different walks of life together to help build Hogwarts&quot;, and being &quot;loved for her charming ways&quot;. According to an interview between Rowling and staff from The Leaky Cauldron, Hufflepuff introduced house-elves to Hogwarts, where she offered them refuge. Both the wizard card and the illustration on Rowling&#x27;s website depict her as a plump woman with red hair.

One relic of Hufflepuff, a small golden cup emblazoned with her symbol of a badger, is inherited by her distant descendant, Hepzibah Smith. This cup is stolen by Tom Riddle and made into a Horcrux. The Hufflepuff Cup was destroyed by Hermione who stabbed it with a basilisk fang in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

=== Rowena Ravenclaw ===
Rowena Ravenclaw was a witch noted for her cleverness, creativity,and wit.She was described by Xenophilius Lovegood as beautiful. The Sorting Hat introduces her as &quot;Fair Ravenclaw, from glen&quot;, suggesting she was from Scotland. Ravenclaw devised the ever-changing floor plans and moving staircases in the Hogwarts castle, and coined the proverb &quot;Wit beyond measure is man&#x27;s greatest treasure.&quot; Ravenclaw is described by the Sorting Hat as having selected students according to intelligence and wisdom. &quot;Rowena Ravenclaw was the most brilliant witch of her time.&quot; It is revealed in the &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; that the broken heart contributing to her untimely death was most likely the loss of her daughter, Helena Ravenclaw, who is, in fact, the Ravenclaw House Ghost (nicknamed The Grey Lady), and the lost diadem, the very relic to which Ravenclaw&#x27;s astounding wisdom was attributed.

The lost diadem granted enhanced wisdom to its wearer. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Harry learns that it became a Horcrux. The Ravenclaw Diadem is destroyed near the end of the book as a result of exposure to Fiendfyre summoned by Vincent Crabbe, who is killed in the process while trying to control the fire. In the film, Harry stabs it with a basilisk fang and kicks it into the burning Room of Requirement.

=== Salazar Slytherin ===
Salazar Slytherin is described as power-hungry by the Sorting Hat, and he was known as &quot;shrewd Slytherin from fen&quot;. Salazar Slytherin was one of the first recorded Parselmouths, an accomplished Legilimens, and a notorious proponent of pureblood supremacy. The pureblood supremacy angle may have been exaggerated over a thousand years. Slytherin is the only founder whose physical appearance is described in any detail; his statue in the Chamber of Secrets depicts a man &quot;ancient and monkey-like, with a long thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of his sweeping robes.&quot; According to Albus Dumbledore, the qualities that Slytherin prized in his handpicked students included the rare ability to speak Parseltongue, resourcefulness, and determination. He also selected his students according to cunning, ambition, and blood purity. Slytherin&#x27;s first name is a reference to the mid-20th-century Portuguese dictator&#x27;s surname; Rowling&#x27;s 1990–1993 stay in Portugal inspired this name choice.

Slytherin&#x27;s background is first discussed by Professor Binns in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (and by Professor McGonagall in the film version and Professor Flitwick in the computer game). He describes the founding of the school and the schism which developed between Slytherin and the other founders, and he mentions that the castle was founded far from Muggles because, at that time, common people feared magic and persecuted suspected wizards and witches. Slytherin wanted magical learning restricted to all-magical families, as he believed Muggle-born students to be untrustworthy and he disliked teaching such students. According to legend, Slytherin was responsible for the construction of the Chamber of Secrets, a chamber with contents including a basilisk, a giant serpent that can kill by looking people directly in the eyes, susceptible to control by the Heir of Slytherin, and left there to purge the school of all Muggle-born students. Another hypothesis suggests the basilisk was meant to fend off an invading Muggle force. This occurred shortly before infighting among the four founders occurred which resulted in Slytherin&#x27;s departure.

Salazar Slytherin&#x27;s locket, passed down to his family, was turned into a Horcrux by his descendant Voldemort and destroyed by Ron Weasley using the Sword of Gryffindor in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;.

In June 2016, J. K. Rowling revealed on Pottermore that Slytherin&#x27;s wand contained a fragment of basilisk horn, and was taught by its creator to &quot;sleep&quot; when instructed, which meant that it could place others who possessed the wand in a sleep from which they could only be awakened by the cries of the person&#x27;s children. This secret was handed down through the centuries to each member of Slytherin&#x27;s family who possessed it. By the 1600s it belonged to the Irish witch Gormlaith Gaunt, though in about 1620 it was stolen by her then-17-year-old niece Isolt Sayre, who fled to where Massachusetts, United States is today. There, she founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She buried the wand outside the school grounds, and within a year, an unknown species of snakewood tree grew from the burial spot. It resisted all attempts to prune or kill it, but after several years the leaves were found to contain powerful medicinal properties.

<text>On a square rigged ship, the spanker is a gaff-rigged fore-and-aft sail set from, and aft of, the aftmost mast. Spankers are also called &quot;driver&quot;, &quot;jigger&quot;, and &quot;pusher&quot; sail.

On a schooner of four or more masts, the spanker is the sail on the mast nearest the stern.

The spanker is a small sail, but as it is so far aft of the balance point of the hull, it has strong leverage. When sheeted in, the spanker is important in driving the boat to a new tack.

It was originally named The Yeungnam Chronicle, however in 1982 the monthly was renamed &quot;The Yeungnam Observer&quot;. The papers, both in Korean and English, are edited by students under the supervision of faculty members.

* University Broadcasting System
Like many other large universities, Yeungnam University has its own radio broadcasting station. University Broadcasting System(UBS) was established in 1965 and has provided music, news and other features on academic affairs, both on and off campus.

=== Alumni Association ===
The Yeungnam University Alumni Association was organized in 1969, February 16. At present there are more than 27 branch offices throughout the country, including Seoul, Busan, Masan, Changwon, Gyeongsan, and Jeju island; and some branches in foreign soil making a list of New York City, Chicago, Washington D.C., Atlanta (the USA), Vancouver, Toronto (Canada), and Indonesia and England. The YUAA can be catalogued even according to the alumni&#x27;s colleges, majors, and their work places. The YUAA Office Hall was purchased in 1972 at Daemyung-Dong, Daegu, which was the first among all college alumni associations in South Korea to be used only for the purpose of alumni services. The YUAA built a New Office Hall on the building site of 462-pyung at Shinchun-Dong, Daegu, in February 1995, of the size of 5-story building including the basement. In September 1996 it became to own an annex of 4-story building with the basement that made the YUAA Office Hall own the real estate larger than any other alumni association in South Korea might have.

<doc id="947602" wikidata="Q847343" url="?curid=947602" title="Wisłoka Dębica">
<text>Wisłoka Dębica () is one of the oldest existing sports clubs in Poland, founded in 1908 by a group of Dębica&#x27;s high school students. The name comes from the River Wisłoka, which flows by the town of Dębica (south-east Poland, 110 kilometers east of Kraków). The most famous athletes, representing the club, are Greco-Roman wrestlers. They won numerous medals, including Olympic, World and European Championships. Names like twins Kazimierz Lipień and Józef Lipień, Ryszard Świerad, Jan Michalik or Roman Wrocławski (who later emigrated to the US, and was the coach of Rulon Gardner) are well known by all fans of wrestling. The club is also renowned for soccer players such as Leszek Pisz, Mirosław Kalita and Waldemar Piątek, who started their careers there, boxers (such as vice-champion of Europe, Roman Gotfryd), and bicycle racers.

Their football team competes in the fourth group of the III liga, the fourth tier of Polish football league system.
First departments, opened in 1908/09, were bicycle-racing, track and field, and well as skating. Association football, the most popular of all sports in Poland, followed some time later – around 1909 (though there is no credible source to confirm this date). The best decade for the club were the 1970s, when its departments were separately sponsored by Dębica&#x27;s main factories, and its athletes won medals during various national and international competitions. White-green athletes marked their presence on several sports arenas. However, since the 1990s, following a general slump in Polish sports, Wisłoka also has had many financial problems. There are few sponsors, and most of them are local businesses, whose financial means are limited. Therefore, most sports departments have been closed, except for football, wrestling and women volleyball.

==Supporters==

Wisłoka is famous for its die-hard fans. Even in times of club&#x27;s misery, its supporters always attended various games and strongly believed that the good times would be back. Fans&#x27; support is very strong to this day – it is the supporters who purchased plastic seats and then mounted them in the stands. In the mid-2000s, the fans created their own association, called Nasz KS, which financially supports the club. A very large factor of the success was the player Edward Kaczor.

Supporters of Wisłoka are allied with fans of two other clubs – Górnik Zabrze (since September 1988) and Siarka Tarnobrzeg (since November 2007). Their biggest rivals are local neighbours Igloopol Dębica with whom they contest the Dębica Derby.

==History==

===First years===
During the first decades of Wisłoka&#x27;s existence, its football players did not manage to achieve anything worth mentioning. In the 1920s and 1930s the team would play games against sides from Tarnów, Mielec, Rzeszów or Jasło. In the early 1930s, one of the best teams in Poland – Cracovia, came to Dębica for a friendly game. Players from Kraków did not treat this match seriously, as Wisłoka managed to tie against the famous rival. However, first 50 years of club&#x27;s existence can be summarized as not very impressive. The most successful were late 1920s, when Wisłoka played in the regional B-Class of Tarnów, which is the equivalent of today&#x27;s third division.

First successes in soccer came in the late 50s. Firstly, in 1957, now non-existent team Stal Dębica was promoted to the third division for one year. Four years later, Stal merged with Wisłoka, and in June 1963 the much stronger team emerged, that won games in Rzeszów&#x27;s regional league, advancing six points before Czuwaj Przemysl. Then, in the play-offs for the national third division, Wisłoka came out as the third team and did not manage to earn promotion. Dębica&#x27;s opponents included Victoria Jaworzno, Star Starachowice, Orzeł Rapid (which later became GKS Katowice) and Górnik Sosnowiec. In the mid-60s, favorite player of Wisłoka&#x27;s supporters was the top-scorer Jerzy Maślanka. Even though he studied in Rzeszów, he always had enough time to come to Dębica and put on the white-green jersey. In 1966, Wisłoka&#x27;s officials brought in a veteran midfielder Ludwik Poświat, who, as a 17-year-old, talented teenager, had won the Championships of Poland (in 1948, with Cracovia). He finished his career in 1972 and remained in Dębica, becoming a trainer of youth teams. Poświat died in 1976.

In the 1966–67 season, the team was expected to advance to the third tier. Wisłoka managed to do so, but not without problems. After fall season, Wisłoka was second, behind the reserve team of Stal Rzeszów. In the spring of 1967, they kept a streak of 12 consecutive games without a loss and won promotion.

===Promotions to the second tier===
Five years later, in the early summer of 1972, another promotion took place – this time to the II liga. Wisłoka finished first, five points ahead of CKS Czeladź. Wisłoka, sponsored by DZOS Stomil (today – Tire Company Dębica) spent seven years in the second division. They placed for most time in the mid-part of the table, only once – in 1975 – finishing on 5th position. In the 1978–79 season, in the first round Wisłoka was placed in the eighth position. Spring round, however, was a catastrophe. Dębica&#x27;s favourites lost many games and as a result Wisłoka was relegated back to the III liga.

===Relegation and lean years===
After relegation, Wisłoka wanted to return to the second level as fast as possible. In the 1979–80 season, it was missed narrowly – they finished second, just after Stal Rzeszów. The 1980s were not as good as the 1970s. The team played at the third tier, group 8th (south-east Poland), for most time placing in the upper half of the table. Unfortunately, Wisłoka was not able to fight for promotion at the time. Apart from main team, there was also a reserve team, two junior and several youth teams. They played in regional games, also in a Ludwik Poświat U-19 Junior Tournament, which was organized every summer since 1979. 
1987 proved to be disappointing, as Wisłoka was relegated to the fourth tier. This was a shock for both fans and officials. Some changes took place, after which &quot;the White and Greens&quot; returned to the third tier in June 1988, finishing before both BKS Bochnia and Okocimski Brzesko. In the 1988–89 season, the Polish Football Association rearranged the competition; instead of eight groups of the third division, four groups were created. Competition for Wisłoka became tougher, but they were able to keep themselves in safe spots.

===Another promotion===
In the 1990–91 season, Wisłoka again, after several years, won promotion to the II liga, group south, finishing ahead of Sandecja Nowy Sącz and Cracovia. The team, led by coach Jan Kasowicz during the whole season, proved its quality, winning 14 games, drawing 7, and losing only 3 (goals 40–13). In the second division Wisłoka was for the most time placing in the middle positions of the table. The highest location of seventh was achieved in the 1993–94 season. In June 1995 however, the team was relegated back to the regional level. In 1995-96 Wisłoka was second, just behind Wawel Kraków, in 1996–97, Dębica&#x27;s favourites were second again, finishing after Czuwaj Przemyśl.

===Four years in the fourth division and promotion in 2006===
In June 2001, Wisłoka was relegated even lower – to the fourth Podkarpacie division. In the 2004–05 season, Wisłoka was second, just behind Stal Sanok. At the end of the following 2005–06 campaign, the White and Greens finished on the first position in the league, three points ahead of Izolator Boguchwała, and won promotion to the third Division. In the 2006–07 season , Wisłoka played in the fourth group of the third tier and came off in the middle of the 16-team table. Next season was similar, after all games, Wisłoka was placed in the mid-table.

===Polish Cup===
Wisłoka, a team which has never managed to qualify to the first division, is an example of a club whose biggest successes are associated with the Polish Cup. Of many Wisłoka&#x27;s games in the Cup of Poland throughout the years, two matches need mentioning. First is an edition in the soccer season 1988–1989. Second is Wisłoka&#x27;s biggest-ever success so far – reaching as far as quarter-finals of the competition, which took place in the season 1992–93.

====1988–89 season====
Wisłoka was at that time playing in the 3rd Regional Division, group 8th (south-east Poland). The team finished the season on the 8th position, just before the reserve team of Igloopol Dębica. On 24 July 1989, in the first round of the Cup of Poland, Wisłoka beat Glinik Gorlice 3–0. On 3 August 1989 Wisłoka defeated Radomiak Radom 2–0, and on 17 August 1989, Wisłoka beat Resovia Rzeszów 5–2. Finally, on 31 August 1989 Wisłoka Dębica tied 0–0, with Górnik Zabrze losing 4–5 on penalty shootout. Undoubtedly, this game was the biggest sports event in the history of the town. The stands were full – around 10,000 fans showed up (which made for around one-fourth of the town&#x27;s population). As minutes passed by, more and more people started to chant songs and clap their hands. During final minutes of the game, the whole crowd was actively supporting Wisłoka.

====1992–93 season====
In that season, Wisłoka played in the Eastern group of the second division, placing on the 12th position. On 12 August 1992, Wisłoka won an away game against Sandecja Nowy Sącz 4–2. On 26 August 1992, Wisłoka won another away game, achieving a 3–0 victory over Stal Mielec II. On 20 October 1992, Wisłoka beat Hutnik Kraków 2–1 at home. On 10 November 1992, Wisłoka headed to the town of Police, where they beat Chemik Police 3–2. Finally, in the quarterfinals of the Polish Cup, played on 10 and 23 March 1993, Wisłoka lost twice to Ruch Chorzów II; 0–1 at home, and 0–2 away. Officially, it was the reserve team that represented Ruch in this Cup campaign, but first team players were allowed to take part, and so they did. Ruch was represented by players such as Radosław Gilewicz, Waldemar Fornalik, Mariusz Śrutwa, Dariusz Gęsior, Jacek Bednarz, Piotr Mósor, among others. Nevertheless, the quarterfinals against Ruch were the biggest success in the history of Wisłoka&#x27;s football team.

<text>The Oakland Seaport is a major container ship facility located in Oakland, California, in the San Francisco Bay. It is operated by the Port of Oakland port authority along with the Oakland International Airport. It was the first major port on the Pacific Coast of the United States to build terminals for container ships. As of 2022, it was the eighth busiest container port in the United States, behind the ports of Los Angeles, New York/New Jersey, Long Beach, Savannah, Houston, Virginia, and Seattle/Tacoma. Development of an intermodal container handling system in 2002 after over a decade of planning and construction positions the Oakland Seaport for further expansion of the West Coast freight market share. In 2019 it ranked 8th in the United States in the category of containers.

==Early history==
In 1852, the year of Oakland&#x27;s incorporation as a town by the California State Legislature, large shipping wharves were constructed along the Oakland Estuary, which was dredged to create a viable shipping channel. 22 years later, in 1874, the previously dredged shipping channel was deepened to make Oakland a deep-water port.

In the late 19th century, Southern Pacific was granted exclusive rights to the port. In January 1906, a small work party employed by the Western Pacific Railroad built a crossing over the Southern Pacific line to connect the Western Pacific mainline with trackage built on an area of the landfill. This act was protested by Southern Pacific and later upheld in court. The court ruled that all landfills since the date of the agreement did not belong to Southern Pacific, ending their monopoly.

In 1921, a channel was dug thirty feet deep at mean low water from the bay to Brooklyn Basin, a distance of four and three quarters miles, and then a channel twenty-five feet deep around the basin and eighteen feet to San Leandro Bay, an added distance of four miles (6 km). The port was not officially named the Port of Oakland until 1927, under the leadership of the newly organized Board of Port Commissioners.

Under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1922, the project produced a channel thirty feet deep and 800 feet wide through the shoal south of Yerba Buena Island, narrowing to 600 feet at the end of the Oakland jetties, widening the estuary channel to 600 feet to Webster Street, dredging the south channel basin to thirty feet and a turning basin, then thirty feet to Park Street, at a cost to the federal government of $6 million.

In 1962, the Port of Oakland began to admit container ships. Container traffic greatly increased the amount of cargo loaded and unloaded at the port. By the late 1960s, the Port of Oakland was the second-largest port in the world in terms of container tonnage. However, depth and navigation restrictions in San Francisco Bay limited its capacity, and by the late 1970s, it had been supplanted by the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach as the major container port on the West Coast.

During an expansion of the port in the late 1960s, fill material was added to what remained of the old Southern Pacific mole. The fill came largely from the concurrent excavation of the Berkeley Hills Tunnel during the construction of the BART system. The BART trunk line also crosses over part of the port, and the east portal of the Transbay Tube that carries BART trains from Oakland to San Francisco lies within the port.

==Recent history==


One of the main limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines; all cranes historically operated between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of the development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that would allow the trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes. The port retained VZM, Korve Engineering, and Earth Metrics to perform engineering and environmental studies to allow detailed engineering to proceed. In 1987, on behalf of the Oakland Port Commission, Allen Broussard led a group of 72 lawyers, port officials, including then-port commissioner Carole Ward Allen, and city officials on a 3-week trip to China, meeting the Mayor of Shanghai, Jiang Zemin (Shanghai is twinned with San Francisco).

The completion of the resulting rail intermodal facility occurred in 2002. That brought the cumulative investment in port expansion to over $1.4 billion since 1962, half of which comprised the intermodal facility. In the early first decade of the 21st century, the new intermodal rail facility, along with severe congestion at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, caused some trans-Pacific shippers to move some of their traffic to the Port of Oakland (especially if the final destination is not in Southern California but lies farther east). Also, the port is now reaping the benefits of investment in post-panamax cranes, dredging, and the transfer of military property, which has now been used for expansion.

The deepening of the port from to to accommodate larger ships has been completed. The ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Seattle, and Tacoma were already deep. The $432 million project was finished in September 2009. Some of mud from the dredging was deposited at the western edge of Middle Harbor Shoreline Park to become a shallow-water wetlands habitat for marine and shore life. Further dredging followed in 2011, to maintain the navigation channel. Prior to the March 2012 arrival of the &quot;MSC Fabiola&quot;, the largest container ship ever to enter the San Francisco Bay, the Port of Oakland prepared by checking channel depth and dredging as needed. The ship arrived with less than its full draft of because it held only three-quarters of a load.

Occupy Oakland, part of the Occupy movement, marched to the port on November 2, 2011, and blocked traffic from entering and leaving. In August 2014, the port was the scene of a protest against an Israeli-owned ship by Palestinian supporters opposed to Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip. The ship&#x27;s cargo was eventually unloaded after a 4-day standoff. The Jewish Press commented that unless the port found a solution to their &quot;protester problem,&quot; there was a good chance the ship&#x27;s owner and other cargo firms would find safer ports to do business with.

The Port is part of &quot;California’s Green Trade Corridor Marine Highway&quot; project, as ships move cargo much greener than trucks and trains. Green Trade Corridor Marine Highway (ports of Oakland-Stockton-West Sacramento) can improve goods movement through Northern California.

In June 2016, The Oakland City Council voted unanimously to ban the handling and storage of both coal and coke at the port. The Oakland City Council voted to ban the handling and storage of coal and coke at the city’s terminals and bulk material facilities. This decision came in opposition to developer Phil Tagami, CEO of the California Capital and Investment Group, financiers of the forthcoming Oakland Bulk and Oversized Terminal.

The Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball planned on constructing a new ballpark for the team at Howard Terminal. On April 26, 2018, the Port of Oakland commissioners voted 6-0 unanimously to enter in to a one-year agreement to negotiate exclusively with the Oakland A’s. This agreement allowed the A’s to pay the Port $100,000 to study economic feasibility and environmental, transportation and accessibility issues.

On November 28, 2018, The Athletics announced that the team had chosen to build its 34,000-seat new ballpark at the Howard Terminal site at the Port of Oakland. However, after delays in stadium planning, in 2023, the Oakland Athletics instead chose to move to Las Vegas, effectively ending the plans for the Howard Terminal Ballpark.

<text>John Abney Culberson (born August 24, 1956) is an American attorney and politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2019. A Republican, he served in in large portions of western Houston and surrounding Harris County. In his 2018 re-election campaign, he was defeated by Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. He subsequently began work as a lobbyist.

==Early life, education, and career==
Culberson was born in Houston, the son of Eleanor (née Abney) and James Vincent Culberson. His great-grandmother was Swedish. Culberson attended Lamar High School. He graduated from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in 1981 with a degree in history. He earned his Juris Doctor degree from South Texas College of Law in 1989.

==Texas House of Representatives==
During his time in law school, Culberson was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, serving his first term beginning in 1987. He was a member of the Republican Whip team, becoming Minority Whip in 1999 during his last term. Culberson began working for the law firm of Lorance and Thompson as a civil defense attorney after he graduated from law school.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

==== 2000 ====
Culberson won the Republican nomination for the 7th District in 2000 after 15-term incumbent Bill Archer announced his retirement. His state house district included much of the congressional district&#x27;s western portion. He finished first in the Republican primary — traditionally the real contest in what has historically been a heavily Republican district – and defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff. He won easily in November, taking about 75% of the vote.

==== 2008 ====

In 2008, Culberson defeated businessman Michael Peter Skelly with 56% of the vote. It was only the second time that a Democrat had even crossed 40 percent of the vote in this district.

On August 1, 2008, to protest the House going into summer recess without discussing a pending energy bill, Culberson and other House Republicans stayed to make speeches about the energy bill in question. The Democratic leadership in the House, which controls services in the chamber, responded by cutting the microphones and cameras. Culberson used social media services Twitter and Qik to provide a live account of the proceedings. Culberson later compared this episode to the Iranian government&#x27;s crackdown against dissidents who used Twitter to protest a restriction on foreign media in June 2009.

==== 2010 ====

Culberson ran unopposed.

==== 2012 ====

Culberson was challenged by the Democratic nominee James Cargas, an energy lawyer for the City of Houston, Green party nominee Lance Findley, and Libertarian Drew Parks.

==== 2014 ====

In the November 4, 2014 general election, Culberson again defeated Democrat James Cargas, who polled 4,092 votes (62.1 percent) in the March 4 primary election. Culberson was unopposed in the Republican primary.

==== 2016 ====

Culberson defeated James Lloyd and Maria Espinoza in the Republican primary election on March 1. Culberson polled 44,202 votes (57.3 percent) to James Lloyd&#x27;s 19,182 (24.9 percent) and the third candidate, Maria Espinoza&#x27;s 13,772 (17.8 percent).

He secured his eighth term in the general election held on November 8, when, with 143,542 votes (56.2 percent), he defeated the Democrat James Cargas (born 1966) of Houston, who garnered 111,991 ballots (43.8 percent).

After Hillary Clinton carried Culberson&#x27;s 7th district in the 2016 presidential election, Democrats began to regard the congressman as vulnerable in 2018.

==== 2018 ====
Culberson defeated Edward Ziegler in the Republican primary with 76% of the vote. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher was the Democratic nominee and defeated him in the general election by a 52.5% to 47.5% margin. Culberson held his own in his longtime base of west Houston and Memorial, much of which he&#x27;d represented for over three decades at the state and federal levels. However, Fletcher swamped him in the district&#x27;s share of southwest Houston that were added in the 2004 redistricting, as well as in the Bear Creek area.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Chairman)
** Subcommittee on Homeland Security
** Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies

===Caucuses===
* Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans
* Congressional Constitution Caucus
* Republican Study Committee
* Tea Party Caucus
*Congressional Constitution Caucus

==Political positions==
Culberson had described himself as a &quot;Fiscally conservative &#x27;Jeffersonian Republican&#x27;... committed to Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s vision of limited government, individual liberty, and states&#x27; rights.&quot;

As of April 2018, he had voted with his party in 97.6% of votes in the 115th Congress and voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position in 98.6% of the votes.

=== Abortion ===
Culberson supported pro-life legislation.

=== ACORN ===
Three years after the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) had been dissolved, Culberson included language in an appropriations bill that said &quot;None of the funds made available in this Act may be distributed to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) or its subsidiaries or successors.&quot;

=== Budget ===
Culberson generally opposed an income tax increase, opposed reducing defense spending in order to balance the budget, opposed federal spending as a means of promoting economic growth, and supported lowering corporate taxes as a means of promoting economic growth.

===Disaster relief===
Culberson was the only Texas Republican to support the $50.7 billion relief effort after Hurricane Sandy. As a member of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee, Culberson has been active in seeking aid in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.

=== Donald Trump ===
Culberson was the first person to endorse Ted Cruz in the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries. In June 2016, Culberson said &quot;I always have and always will support the Republican nominee. The party should unify behind the presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, to defeat Hillary Clinton.&quot;

In February 2017, he voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request 10 years of Trump&#x27;s tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session. He supports the construction of a wall along the Mexican border, and supports requiring immigrants who are unlawfully present to return to their country of origin before they are eligible for citizenship.

Culberson supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to suspend the refugee resettlement program and curtail immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that &quot;This is a necessary pause in the refugee program until our intelligence agencies can develop adequate background checks to ensure that the people coming into the country are coming in for the right reasons.&quot;

=== Environment ===
Culberson rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He has alleged that scientists have falsified climate change data. He has said that &quot;the liberal obsession with climate change... is driven by their desire to raise more money for the government&quot;. He opposes cap-and-trade programs and the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. He supports government funding for the development of renewable energy.

Culberson had a lifetime score of 4% from the League of Conservation Voters.

===Guns===
In 2016, Culberson wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch threatening to block President Obama&#x27;s executive order on guns by defunding the United States Department of Justice.

=== Healthcare ===
Culberson opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and supported its repeal. On May 4, 2017, Culberson voted to repeal Obamacare and pass the American Health Care Act of 2017. The AHCA would have allowed insurers to charge seniors five times as much for health coverage than younger people (the ACA limit was three times as much) and allowed insurers to raise premiums on individuals with preexisting conditions who did not have continuous coverage.

In 2013, Culberson said &quot;like 9/11, &#x27;let&#x27;s roll!&#x27;&quot; to describe a vote to make a delay of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act a condition for funding the government.

===Immigration===
In 2003, Mr. Culberson claimed that &quot;Al Qaeda terrorists and Chinese nationals are infiltrating our country virtually anywhere they choose from Brownsville to San Diego,&quot; and that &quot;a large number of Islamic individuals have moved into homes in Nuevo Laredo and are being taught Spanish to assimilate with the local culture.&quot; He would go on to say, &quot;Full scale war is underway on our southern border, and our entire way of life is at risk if we do not win the battle for Laredo.&quot;

===Presidential citizenship===
In 2009, Culberson co-sponsored legislation to enforce citizenship requirements on presidential candidates by requiring all future presidential candidates to provide proof of their citizenship when filing to run for office. The legislation was in response to Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories which questioned the legitimacy of Barack Obama&#x27;s birth certificate.

=== Science ===
Culberson marked up a 2016 spending bill to include a requirement that the National Science Foundation direct about 70% of its funding to biology, computing, engineering, and math and physical sciences. The earmarked funds would not cover geoscience and the social and behavioral sciences.

In 2008, he expressed concern about foreign-born students coming to the United States to obtain advanced academic degrees and then returning to their countries of origin. He opposes requiring states to adopt federal education standards.

Culberson was a strong advocate for the multiple flyby and lander missions to the Jovian moon Europa. When he lost his seat to his Democratic opponent Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in the 2018 election, support for the lander mission declined.

<text>Gainsborough Old Hall in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire is over five hundred years old and one of the best preserved medieval manor houses in England.

==History==
===Construction and royal visit by Richard III===
The hall was built by Sir Thomas Burgh in 1460. The Burghs were rich, flamboyant and powerful. Gainsborough Old Hall was not only their home, but also a demonstration of their wealth and importance. Burgh was a benefactor to Newark Church and also the founder of the Chantry and Alms House at Gainsborough. In 1470, the manor was attacked by Sir Robert Welles over a clash about lands, status, and honour, but it was not severely damaged. In 1484 Thomas entertained King Richard III in his hall. Henry VII intended to raise Thomas to the pre-eminence of a Barony, but no second writ was issued, nor was a patent.

===Incarceration of Edward Burgh===
In 1510, Thomas Burgh&#x27;s son, Edward Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh, was incarcerated at the Old Hall after being declared a lunatic, never having attended the House of Lords. He died in 1528, leaving his eldest son Sir Thomas as head of the family. He was regarded as 1st Baron Burgh, &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd. 

===Royal visits by Henry VIII and role in Catherine Howard&#x27;s execution===

Henry VIII visited Gainsborough twice: once in 1509, and again in 1541 with his fifth wife, Queen Katherine Howard. The Queen was accused of indiscretions both at Gainsborough and Lincoln, and she was later executed. Katherine Parr, by this time widowed twice (Edward Burgh having died in 1533), became Henry&#x27;s sixth wife.

===Meeting location for separatists===
When Thomas, the fifth Lord Burgh, died without an heir, the Hall was sold in 1596 to William Hickman, a merchant from London, who made many improvements, especially to the east wing. William and his mother Rose supported John Smyth and the Separatist movement, and allowed them to meet and worship in the hall from 1603 until they sailed to the low countries to find religious freedom and establish the Baptist movement. The Hickman family continued to play a prominent role in the development of Gainsborough, and many became local members of Parliament. Sir Neville Hickman invited John Wesley to preach in the Great Hall several times in 1759, and in 1761 and 1764.

===Unoccupied building===
In 1720 a new house was built at Thonock on the edge of the town and the Old Hall became unoccupied. It remained in the family and was used for a variety of purposes.

==Architectural elements==
Architecturally, the Old Hall has changed very little over the years. It is principally a timber framed building, giving a characteristic &#x27;striped&#x27; or &#x27;black and white&#x27; appearance. On the north-east corner is a brick tower. A splendid view of the town is available after a fifty-nine-step climb to the top.

Today, the Hall with its elaborate timber roof survives, with a kitchen which is possibly the most complete medieval kitchen in England. The kitchen still contains many original features, including two open fireplaces, each large enough to roast an ox, and two bread ovens served by a third chimney.

===Witches&#x27; marks===
The Hall contains a great number of &quot;witches&#x27; marks&quot;, thought to prevent against evil, and curses carved into its walls. There are also many burn marks, to protect against fire.

==Reputed haunting by the Grey Lady==
The tower of the Old Hall is supposedly haunted by the Grey Lady, thought to be the daughter of the Lord of the Manor, who fell in love with a poor soldier and planned to elope with him. Her father discovered the plan and locked her away in the tower, where she died from a broken heart. According to local legend, the girl&#x27;s spirit still wanders the tower, endlessly waiting for her lover to arrive.

==Ownership by the state and status as a listed building==
The house was looked after from 1949 by a volunteer group, The Friends of the Old Hall (FOHA), who saved the building and first opened it to the public. Sir Edmund Bacon gave it to the nation in 1970. The house is now owned by English Heritage and is open to the public as a museum. It is listed as Grade I for Heritage Protection. The Friends organisation still exists, and provides volunteer guides and other expertise.

<doc id="947616" wikidata="Q1057264" url="?curid=947616" title="House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)">
<text>House on Haunted Hill is a 1999 American supernatural horror film directed by William Malone and starring Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Bridgette Wilson, Peter Gallagher, and Chris Kattan. The plot follows a group of strangers who are invited to a party at an abandoned insane asylum, where they are offered $1 million each by an amusement park mogul if they are able to survive the night. Produced by Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver, it is a remake of the 1959 film of the same title directed by William Castle. The film marked the producing debut of Dark Castle Entertainment, a production company that went on to produce numerous other horror films, including additional remakes.

Screenwriter Dick Beebe adapted the film&#x27;s script from Robb White&#x27;s 1959 original, updating elements of the story and introducing a significant supernatural component which was absent from the original film. Filming took place in Los Angeles in early 1999, with famed make-up artists Gregory Nicotero and Dick Smith providing the film&#x27;s special effects.

&quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; was released on Halloween weekend in 1999. In the tradition of William Castle&#x27;s theater gimmicks, Warner Bros. supplied promotional scratchcards to cinemas showing the film, offering ticket buyers a chance to win a money prize, similar to the movie&#x27;s characters. The film was a commercial success, opening at number one at the U.S. box office, and grossing $65 million worldwide. It received largely negative reviews from critics, with some deriding its use of special effects and gore, though it did receive some praise for its performances and horror elements.

In 2007, the film was followed by a direct-to-DVD sequel, &quot;Return to House on Haunted Hill&quot;, which was released in both rated and unrated editions.

== Plot ==
In 1931, the patients at the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane revolt with a prison riot against the staff, headed by the sadistic Dr. Richard B. Vannacutt. The patients start a fire which engulfs the building, killing all of the inmates and all but five of Vannacutt&#x27;s staff.

In 1999, Evelyn Stockard-Price is in a disintegrating marriage with Stephen Price, an amusement park mogul who loves playing tricks. At Evelyn&#x27;s insistence, Price stages her birthday party at the long-abandoned hospital. The building&#x27;s owner, Watson Pritchett, is convinced it is evil, having lived there as a child when it was converted to a private residence. Five guests arrive for the party: film producer Jennifer Jenzen, baseball player Eddie Baker, former television personality Melissa Marr, physician Donald Blackburn, and Pritchett himself. The guests are not the ones Price invited and neither of the Prices know who they are. Despite this, Price continues the party&#x27;s advertised theme, offering $1 million to each guest who remains in the house until morning; those who flee or perish forfeit their $1 million to the others.

The building&#x27;s security system is mysteriously tripped, locking everyone inside – a stunt which Price blames on Evelyn. Evelyn and Steven are at one another&#x27;s throats, each trying to kill the other. Jennifer, Eddie, and Pritchett search the basement for the security system&#x27;s control panel. While exploring the labyrinthine basement, Jennifer unknowingly becomes separated from Eddie and confesses that her real name is Sara Wolfe, the recently fired assistant to the real Jennifer. She impersonated Jennifer, hoping to win the prize money. Shortly after, Sara is nearly pulled into a tank of blood by a doppelgänger impersonating Eddie, but the real Eddie arrives in time to save her. Melissa subsequently disappears, leaving behind a massive trail of blood and a video camera that shows brief, ambiguous footage of her being dragged off-screen. Price visits his assistant Schechter, who is supposed to be managing the party stunts, but finds him horribly mutilated. On the surveillance monitor he sees the ghost of Dr. Vannacutt walking around with a bloody saw.

Evelyn seemingly dies in front of the others, strapped to an electroshock therapy table. Price pulls a gun on the guests, demanding to know who killed his wife. Eddie knocks him out and they lock Price in the &quot;Saturation Chamber&quot;, an archaic zoetrope device that Vannacutt used to treat schizophrenics. Blackburn volunteers to guard Price. When the others leave, he turns the chamber on, leaving Price to be tortured by the moving images and ghostly hallucinations. In Vannacutt&#x27;s office, Sara and Eddie find a portrait of the hospital&#x27;s head staff and realize that the Prices and invited party guests, with the exception of Blackburn, are descendants of the five survivors of the 1931 fire. After Pritchett mentions that the massive spiritual energy in the house manifests and travels in many ways, Sara deduces that the spirits hacked the guest list on Price&#x27;s computer through the Internet.

Blackburn returns to Evelyn&#x27;s body and revives her with an injection. He is revealed as Evelyn&#x27;s lover. Together they have faked Evelyn&#x27;s death, plotting to frame Price for the murders, hoping one of the guests will kill him in self-defense. Fearing the guests are not yet sufficiently motivated to turn on Price, Evelyn heartlessly kills Blackburn, adding another victim, then releases a delirious Price from the Saturation Chamber. Sara, Eddie, and Pritchett discover that Evelyn&#x27;s body is missing and return to the chamber, where they find Blackburn&#x27;s head and body separated from one another. Sara searches for Price and hears Melissa&#x27;s faint cries for help. Instead Sara finds Price, covered in blood, and shoots him. Eddie and Pritchett arrive and bring Sara upstairs, after which Evelyn approaches Price to gloat. Price, protected by a bulletproof vest and posing as dead, attacks Evelyn. As they scuffle, Evelyn is thrown through a decaying door, revealing the evil entity of the house – The Darkness.

The shape-shifting entity, composed of the spirits in the house, consumes Evelyn, killing her and adding her spirit to its mass. Price then discovers Melissa&#x27;s dismembered body. The Darkness turns to Price and tries to add him to its mass. He flees until he arrives at the end of a hallway with a locked door, pleading with the others to open it. As Pritchett does so, Price dives out of the way of the approaching Darkness, which grabs Pritchett and retreats downstairs, killing him. Price has a sudden realization that the attic might house the mechanisms used to operate the lockdown system and flees there, followed by Sara and Eddie. Price opens an iron gate in the attic, then sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape. Sara gets out, but The Darkness cuts a rope that closes the gate, trapping Eddie.

As The Darkness prepares to assimilate Eddie, he reveals that he is adopted and not a true descendant of the original staff. Pritchett&#x27;s ghost appears and opens the iron gate just as The Darkness advances to assimilate Eddie, and Sara pulls Eddie outside before the gate slams shut again. Pritchett&#x27;s ghost and The Darkness fade away as Sara and Eddie watch the sun rise. They find an envelope on a ledge, containing all five checks, made out to cash and signed by Price. They are relieved to have escaped and won the money but are stuck on the roof of the house, unsure of how to get down.

In a black-and-white post-credits scene, the spirits of the 1931 patients are seen torturing the Prices, presumably doomed to eternal damnation in the afterlife.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===

&quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; was the first film produced by American production company Dark Castle Entertainment. Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis had discussed remaking William Castle&#x27;s 1959 film as early as 1997. Castle&#x27;s daughter Terry Castle served as co-producer on the remake. Director William Malone was a fan of the original film, which he had seen in his childhood. Malone and producer Dick Beebe worked on the film&#x27;s screenplay for a year and a half. According to Malone, he wrote approximately twenty percent of the screenplay, though he did not take a writing credit on it.

Co-producer Gilbert Adler noted that he felt the film was &quot;totally different&quot; from the original, but retained the spirit of the original, in terms of &quot;how we&#x27;re telling the story, and the basic tenets of the story itself. We contemporize it as much as possible.&quot; The unethical psychiatry methods and experimental procedures featured in the film were loosely based on medical experiments conducted by the Nazis. Unlike in the 1959 film, in which a supernatural element was only hinted at (and ultimately revealed to be a ruse), the reality of paranormal forces attacking the party attendees was made explicit in Beebe&#x27;s screenplay.

=== Casting ===
Geoffrey Rush signed on to appear as Steven Price, the theme park mogul in the film. The Price character name, as well as some of the character&#x27;s overall personality and mannerisms, are references to actor Vincent Price, who portrayed the same character—named &quot;Frederick Loren&quot;—in the original film. Malone stated that Rush was committed to the material and took the role seriously. Elizabeth Hurley was initially considered for the role of Evelyn Price, but by February 1999, Famke Janssen was ultimately cast in the part.

Taye Diggs was subsequently cast as Eddie, the ex-professional baseball player attending the party, and agreed to appear in the film after Rush signed onto the project. Ali Larter, who had previously completed &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; (1999), was cast as Sara Wolfe, a woman who poses as her ex-boss, film executive Jennifer Jensen; the film marked Larter&#x27;s third screen appearance. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; star Chris Kattan was cast as Watson Pritchett, the caretaker of the building. Terry Castle stated that Kattan was cast in the part for the sake of comic relief, and that the filmmakers allowed Kattan to &quot;just [be] who he is.&quot;

For the role of Dr. Vannacutt, the deranged head doctor of the hospital, singer Marilyn Manson was at one point considered, but Jeffrey Combs was ultimately cast in the part.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in late 1998 and early 1999 in Los Angeles, California, with exteriors of the house&#x27;s driveway being shot in Griffith Park near the Griffith Park Observatory. Adler commented on the unorthodox nature of the house: &quot;Instead of being a typical sort of haunted house, this [one] is much more modern, with a touch of Deco. It&#x27;s not what you&#x27;d expect to see.&quot; Larter stated in an on-set interview: &quot;The set is dark and dirty, and everyone&#x27;s been sick, and [Taye Diggs] and Chris [Kattan] keep me laughing. We really have had a good time.&quot;

The &quot;Terror Incognita&quot; roller coaster at Price&#x27;s amusement park featured in the beginning of the film is actually The Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal Islands of Adventure theme park at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida.

The film was shot on 35 mm film stock, the negatives of which director Malone flashed in order to reduce the contrast of the picture, giving it a visual appearance similar to the film stock used in the early 20th century.

=== Visual effects ===

Some reviewers noted that the surrealistic jerking, twitching effect of the ghosts featured in the film was similar to the effects in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s film &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (1990). The special effects in the film were designed by Gregory Nicotero and Robert Kurtzman, with additional makeup design by Dick Smith in his last film credit. One of the monster figures featured in the film during Price&#x27;s underwater hallucination sequence was a creation of Smith&#x27;s that was intended to be used in &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1981) but was ultimately not featured. Malone, struck by the appearance of the figure—which consisted of an eyeless, noseless human head with an enlarged mouth—was granted permission from Smith to use it in the film.

The tentacular morphing mass of ghosts featured at the film&#x27;s climax was designed by KNB Effects, and was inspired by the visuals of H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novels, as well as resembling the Rorschach inkblots used in psychiatry. According to Malone, much of the visual elements were actually not computer-generated, and were actually made up of footage shot by the production crew, which was grafted together to form the mass.

Other practical visual effects included the use of a spinning saw blade being held in front of a camera lens to achieve a fluttering look to the hallucinatory sequences experienced by Price in the Saturation Chamber.

===Post-production===
==== Deleted footage ====
Several key scenes were taken out of the final cut of the film. This included an exposition scene showing how Sara came to receive an invitation to the party: While working as a production assistant on a film set, Sara is fired by her boss, Jennifer Jenzen (played by Debi Mazar), the feisty vice president of a motion picture company. Two versions of the scene were shot, during which Sara hands Jennifer a bag delivered for her; inside is a music box with a jack-in-a-box-trigger which cuts the handler&#x27;s finger. Jennifer throws the box in the garbage, and Sara discovers the invitation to Price&#x27;s party inside of it.

Another scene removed from the film last-minute, according to director Malone, was a scene in which Sara falls through a collapsing floor when she and Baker are being chased by The Darkness. After falling two stories below, Wolfe awakens in a subterranean crematorium filled with the ashes and corpses of the hospital&#x27;s dead patients. There, she is attacked by reanimated corpses who rise out of the ashes, terrorizing her and tearing off her overcoat. As a result of the scene&#x27;s removal, there remains a continuity error in the final cut of the film, in which Wolfe&#x27;s overcoat disappears from her body in-between scenes.

A final epilogue scene completing the Jennifer Jenzen story arc was also filmed, featuring Jennifer arriving at the house with a realtor, which she is to inherit. As she enters the front door, a bloodcurdling scream is heard, and the realtor is revealed to be Dr. Vannacutt. Director Malone said the scene ultimately was removed after the cutting of Jenzen&#x27;s exposition scene, as well as for having a comical tone that did not fit with the rest of the film.

All three deleted scenes from the film were included on the 2000 Warner Bros. Home Video release of the film on DVD in the bonus features section.

== Music ==

The soundtrack for the film was commercially released on the label Varèse Sarabande, containing selections from the original score by Don Davis. Davis composed the film score and recorded it with an orchestra in a Seattle church. In order to lend the score a gothic quality, Davis intended to implement a pipe organ, but due to budgetary reasons instead used sampled organ pieces.

Track listing

The song &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; by Marilyn Manson is not on the soundtrack but plays during the scene lead up to the Asylum and end credits.

== Release ==
=== Marketing ===
In keeping with the spirit of William Castle&#x27;s tradition of releasing each of his films with a marketing gimmick, Warner Bros. and Dark Castle supplied movie theatres with scratch-off tickets that would be given to moviegoers. The scratch-off ticket would give each patron a chance to win money, like the characters in the film. The cash prizes totaled $1 million, including movie rentals from Blockbuster.

Dark Castle had originally intended to release each of their films with a gimmick much like Castle had done. They had considered releasing the remake &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; in 3-D with special glasses similar to the ones used by the characters in the film. These plans were scrapped and &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; remains the only film released with a special marketing gimmick.

The film premiered in Los Angeles on October 27, 1999, at the Mann Village Theater. Janssen, Kattan, Larter and Wilson were in attendance with director Malone, as well as producers Silver and Adler.

=== Home media ===
Warner Home Video released &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; on VHS and a special edition DVD in April 2000. In 2006, Warner reissued it as part of a double feature DVD paired with the original 1959 film.

On October 9, 2018, Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray for the first time in North America as a collector&#x27;s edition featuring new interviews with Malone and other crew, among various other features.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; was released theatrically in North America on October 29, 1999, screening at 2,710 theaters. It opened at number one at the U.S. box office that weekend, earning over $15 million in sales. Its theatrical exhibition lasted 61 weeks. By the end of tis theatrical run, the film had a domestic gross of $40,846,082 and an international gross of $24,244,459, for a total of $65,090,541 worldwide.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; received generally negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 31% rating, based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Unsophisticated and unoriginal film fails to produce scares.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 28 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;&quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; is the kind of horror movie that&#x27;s not a bit scary and quite a bit gross. Yet it&#x27;s also mildly, even pleasantly, entertaining, at least by the diminished standard set by this summer&#x27;s &quot;The Haunting&quot; ... [it] sets up hostile relationships between the characters, which allows the audience to wonder who is doing what to whom. Finding out is not so interesting, but getting there isn&#x27;t so bad.&quot; Maitland McDonough of &quot;Film Journal&quot; gave the film a similar review, saying &quot;The proceedings are all utterly conventional, but watching them unfold is mildly diverting if you&#x27;re in the right frame of mind, as many moviegoers apparently were over the Halloween weekend,&quot; also favorably comparing the film to Jan de Bont&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Haunting&quot;, which was released several months prior.

Kim Newman, writing for &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, praised the &quot;try-anything approach of writer-director William Malone&quot; and observed that the film &quot;manages to respect the original&#x27;s intentions far more than such recent remakes as the 1999 versions of &quot;The Mummy&quot; and &quot;The Haunting&quot;...  The mix of laughs, shocks and gruesomeness is much the same as in the two &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; movies, but Malone coaxes a slightly fresher flavour, taking on board the influence of David Fincher and even Lars von Trier.&quot;

Eric Harrison of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the performances in the film, particularly those of Rush, Kattan, and Larter, but felt that the screenplay&#x27;s tone was inconsistent, writing: &quot;Humans do so many horrible things to each other in &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; that the ghosts don&#x27;t stand a chance of keeping up, which may explain why the script makes such nitwits of the characters—if the spooks are going to make an impression, they need all the help they can get.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B− rating, calling it &quot;trash, but creepier than you expect.&quot; Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a favorable review, noting its &quot;cheap scares,&quot; but adding: &quot;Given the irredeemable cheesiness of the original 1958 &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, the makers of the remake had nowhere to go but up. So it&#x27;s not exactly a stunning surprise to find the new horror opus is a slicker and scarier piece of work.&quot;

Lawrence Van Gelder&#x27;s of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a sorry reincarnation&quot; of the original, adding: &quot;This film wastes the talents of actors like Geoffrey Rush and Peter Gallagher in hollow roles and relies heavily on its sets and special effects to do the work that should have been accomplished by its director and writer.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Marc Savlov echoed a similar sentiment, writing: &quot;The nicest thing I can say about this remake of William Castle&#x27;s 1958 shocker is that Geoffrey Rush, god bless him, sure can do a fine imitation of Vincent Price&#x27;s original mustache, even better than John Waters&#x27;s -- which is no mean feat.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
It was nominated for Worst Remake at the 1999 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

== Sequel ==
In 2007, the film was followed up with a direct-to-DVD sequel, &quot;Return to House on Haunted Hill&quot;, with Jeffrey Combs reprising his role as Vannacut and was released in both rated and unrated editions. The film had no involvement from William Malone and received poor reviews, mainly due to plot holes, continuity in the building design and various other features of the film, but it was praised for its state-of-the-art Blu-Ray feature in which the viewer can change the path of the story.

<doc id="947617" wikidata="Q289307" url="?curid=947617" title="Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki">
<text>Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki (born Ioanna Daskalaki, December 12, 1955) is a Greek businesswoman and Ambassador-at-Large for the Hellenic Republic. She is best known for being the leader of the bidding and organizing committees for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. In July 2019, she was appointed by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to lead &quot;Greece 2021&quot;, a year-long initiative to both commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Greek Revolution and to introduce to the world a new Greece of effort and optimism.

She was named one of the 50 most powerful women by &quot;Forbes magazine&quot; and is the author of the New York Times Bestseller &quot;My Greek Drama&quot;.

==Early life==
Ioanna Daskalaki was born to a middle-class family in Heraklion, Crete. Daskalaki studied law in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

==Personal life==
In 1990, she married the Greek shipping and steel magnate Theodore Angelopoulos, and has since been involved in several aspects of Angelopoulos&#x27; business interests, mainly in shipping.

She is the mother of three children, Panagiotis, Dimitris, and Carolina Angelopoulos, and the grandmother of three granddaughters.

==Political career==
In the late 1980s, she became actively involved in politics in Athens. In 1986, she was elected to the Athens Municipal Council. In 1989, she was elected to the Greek Parliament, and won reelection the following year.

In 1998, she was appointed Ambassador at Large by the Greek government. She was paid for this appointment and donates the sums to several Greek charities each year.

In 2004 she was appointed Commander of the Order of Honour of the Hellenic Republic and in 2008, she was appointed Chevalier of the French Republic&#x27;s National Order of the Legion of Honor.

==Involvement in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games==

Disappointed over losing the bid for the centenary celebration of the revival of the Olympic Games in 1996, Greek officials decided to bid for the 2004 Summer bidding committee, making her the first female president of any Olympic or Paralympíc organizing committee, and succeeded in bringing the games to Athens. She was however excluded from the initial organization committee that would prepare for the games.

When the International Olympic Committee questioned Greece&#x27;s commitment to the games and its ability to complete all preparations prior to the opening ceremony, Angelopoulos-Daskalaki was asked to return and was named president of the Olympic Organizing Committee in May 2000. She was the first woman to hold this position. Under her watch, competition facilities were completed and security issues were taken care of. International Olympic Committee presidents Juan Antonio Samaranch and Jacques Rogge both specifically credit Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki for the success of the games. In his speech at the Closing Ceremony, Rogge said, &quot;These Games were unforgettable, dream Games.&quot;

After the 2004 Olympic Games, Angelopoulos-Daskalaki bought the Eleftheros Typos newspaper (&quot;Free Press”); the daily paper eventually was wound up, with its staff receiving on top of their severance pay the proceeds from the sale of the paper&#x27;s title. She also attended the opening ceremony of the next Olympics, in Torino, Italy.

==Involvement In Greece 2021==

&quot;Greece 2021&quot; is a multidimensional initiative that will occur at the time of the 200th Anniversary of the Greek Revolution. While honoring Greece&#x27;s past, &quot;Greece 2021&quot; will primarily celebrate the skill and resilience of the Greek people and demonstrate its confidence in the future. Specific emphasis on entrepreneurship, science and innovation, will highlight the opportunities found in the modern Greece.

In 2019, the Greek Government appointed Mrs Angelopoulos as President of the &quot;Greece 2021&quot; National Committee.

==Post-political career==
In 1994, she was appointed vice-chairman of the Dean&#x27;s Council of Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, where she continues to serve today.

In 1995, Angelopoulos-Daskalaki co-chaired, along with Kennedy School Professor Graham Allison, a Harvard Leadership Symposium titled &quot;The Greek Paradox: Promise vs. Performance&quot;, which addressed the gap between Greece&#x27;s potential and its performance in the realms of politics, economic growth, and regional leadership. Harvard published a book that followed the symposium with the same title. Angelopoulos-Daskalaki is the author of the book&#x27;s preface.

In 2008, Harvard University, in collaboration with the Kennedy School of Government Chan School of Public Health, established the Angelopoulos Chair for Public Health and International Development.

In 2012, she created the Harvard Kennedy School-based Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellowship program as a part of a Commitment to Action for the Clinton Global Initiative. The program was announced by Ambassador Angelopoulos, with Dean Ellwood and former U.S. President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in 2011. The program provides opportunities for high-profile leaders who are transitioning out of public office or other leadership positions to spend time in residence at Harvard for teaching, learning and research.

In 2013, Angelopoulos-Daskalaki established the Angelopoulos Clinton Global Initiative University (CGIU) Fellowship program to recruit, select and sponsor Greek students with implementable entrepreneurial ideas. She has since sponsored over 75 students. In 2016, she announced the evolution of the CGIU program into the Angelopoulos 100, a vehicle to sustain and support the alumni of the program and continue to empower Greek entrepreneurs.

In February 2019, Gianna Angelopoulos established an innovative program at Cambridge University that further reflects her commitment to education, entrepreneurship and economic growth. The Gianna Angelopoulos Programme for Science, Technology and Innovation will be an internationally unique ecosystem of training, research and entrepreneurial activity. The Programme will support PhD students and four academic positions based at the university&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory in the fields of energy materials and devices and computational multiphysics.

==Authored Books==
She is the author of &quot;My Greek Drama: Life, Love, and One Woman&#x27;s Olympic Effort to Bring Glory to Her Country&quot;. The book debuted at #18 on the New York Times Nonfiction Bestseller list for the June 2, 2013 print edition, and entered the top 10 at #7 in the June 9, 2013 print edition of the paper. The book was also a Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller.

<doc id="947618" wikidata="Q644772" url="?curid=947618" title="Hans Vonk (conductor)">
<text>Hans Vonk (18 June 1942 – 29 August 2004) was a Dutch conductor.

==Early and middle years==
Vonk was born in Amsterdam, the son of Franciscus Cornelis and Wilhelmina Vonk. His father was a violinist in the Concertgebouw Orchestra, and died when Vonk was age three. Vonk studied piano with Jaap Spaanderman at the Amsterdam Conservatory and law at Amsterdam University. During this time, he made a living from gigs as a jazz pianist. He later studied conducting with Hermann Scherchen and Franco Ferrara.

Vonk debuted as a conductor with the Netherlands National Ballet. He later married the ballerina, Jessie Folkerts. He also served as assistant conductor with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, and associate conductor with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London.

Vonk held chief conductor positions with De Nederlandse Opera (1976-1985), the Residentie Orkest (1980–1991) and the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra. From 1985 to 1990, he was principal conductor of both the Staatskapelle Dresden and the Semper Oper, Dresden. In 1988 he conducted at La Scala in Milan in a revival of Jommelli&#x27;s &quot;Fetonte&quot;, but then had to take a year off from conducting after being diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome, a neurological condition. He appeared to recover and resumed conducting. He became chief conductor of the WDR Symphony Orchestra, Cologne in 1991.

==With the SLSO==
In the US, he made his first guest appearance with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) in 1992. In January 1995, he was appointed the SLSO&#x27;s music director, after Leonard Slatkin, and took up the position in 1996. In 2001, Vonk began to experience muscular weakness, which was not diagnosed to a specific ailment at the time. In 2002, he resigned his position in St. Louis because of these health problems, which were later diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease.

His last performance with the SLSO was of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 4, on Saturday, 4 May 2002. The applause lasted four minutes and was followed by a commendation read by the chairman of the Board of Trustees, Virginia Weldon: &quot;In recognition of his vital leadership and exemplary artistry, as well as his lasting contribution to the rich cultural legacy of both this orchestra and the region of Saint Louis, it is with great pride and affection that the Board of Trustees of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra bestows this commendation on Maestro Hans Vonk, on this day, Saturday, 4 May 2002, Saint Louis, Missouri.&quot; To which the maestro briefly responded: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, since I&#x27;m a United States conductor I&#x27;m supposed to say something to the audience. I would like to thank you for your presence through this six years. Everything I have to say happened tonight on stage.&quot;

The SLSO dedicated a program of Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; to him after his death.

==Final years==
In March 2002, Vonk was named chief conductor of the Netherlands Radio Symphony (NRSO). He held the post for the 2003–2004 season, and was the orchestra&#x27;s last chief conductor before its disbandment. His illness had debilitated him to the point that he conducted several NRSO concerts from a wheelchair. On 29 August 2004, Vonk died in his Amsterdam home and is buried in that city under the epitaph (in English):

:&quot;Music was his life.&lt;br&gt;Now it brings us&lt;br&gt;Solace and serenity&quot;.

Luuk Reurich wrote a biography of Vonk, &quot;Hans Vonk, Een dirigentenleven&quot; (&quot;Hans Vonk, A Conductor&#x27;s Life&quot;), published in 2006. Vonk&#x27;s recordings are on the Chandos and Denon labels, among others, and include two CDs of the Dutch composer Alphons Diepenbrock. Vonk was regarded as a specialist in the music of Anton Bruckner as well as an advocate of the music of Peter Schat, including conducting the world premiere of Schat&#x27;s stage work &quot;Houdini&quot;.
Vonk&#x27;s widow, Jessie, moved to Tasmania where she founded the Hans Vonk Music House, a chamber music venue dedicated to her husband&#x27;s memory.

<doc id="947625" wikidata="Q520260" url="?curid=947625" title="Schießbefehl">
<text> (; German for &quot;order to fire&quot;) was the term in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) for standing orders authorizing the use of lethal force by the Border Troops to prevent (defection) at the Inner German border from 1960 to 1989.

 recommended guards use firearms to stop unauthorised border crossings in the direction of West Germany and procedure to conceal incidents from the public. Various orders were issued, and their instructions to prevent East Germans leaving were not officially legal until 1982 and in violation of Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. An estimated 300 to 400 people died at the Inner German border during its existence. After German reunification in 1990, East German leader Erich Honecker was indicted by the Berlin District Court on charges of mass murder stemming from the orders. However, his failing health and legal disputes over jurisdiction led his trial to be abandoned.

==&quot;Schießbefehl&quot;==
===Prescribed procedure===
The Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic (&quot;Grenztruppen der DDR&quot;) were the border guards of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and until October 1949 of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, tasked with preventing the mass outward migration of East Germans to the West known as &quot;Republikflucht&quot;. The issue was a major political concern for the East German government, as the idea that any citizen of communist East Germany would voluntarily defect to the capitalist West was a source of ideological embarrassment, and preventing such defections was a longstanding objective. Originally the Border Troops were not formally integrated into the regular armed forces, the National People&#x27;s Army (NVA), but typically carried military-level small arms such as Kalashnikov assault rifles or SKS semiautomatic carbines. From 1945, Soviet and East German border guards were given standing orders commonly referred to as &quot;Schießbefehl&quot; (&quot;order to fire&quot;) that instructed them to follow certain rules of engagement when encountering persons moving illegally within the border strip:

*First, to call out &quot;Halt, stehenbleiben, oder ich schieße!&quot; (&quot;Stop, stand still or I will shoot&quot;).
*Next, to fire a &quot;warning shot&quot;.
*Finally, if the fugitive failed to comply, to fire an &quot;aimed shot&quot;, preferably at the legs, to stop the person.

The Border Troops were told to avoid shooting in the direction of the territory of West Berlin and West Germany.

All occurrences at border outposts were kept secret from the general public, with each attempted or successful escape followed by a formal investigation by the military prosecution authority and the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). After stopping a potential escape attempt, the shooter would be granted a special leave and rewarded with commendations and cash bonuses. Often the shooter would be transferred to another military unit and ordered to keep silent. By contrast, when a fugitive was successful and crossed the border into West Germany, disciplinary measures were taken against those border guards who had failed to prevent this &quot;Grenzverletzung und Republikflucht&quot; (border violation and desertion from the Republic), which often included prison terms in the infamous military prison at Schwedt. Many border guards tried to let fugitives escape while deflecting such accusations by deliberately shooting off-target. When would-be escapees were killed, strict regulations were imposed on the family regarding the funeral; for instance, no obituaries were to be printed in the local newspapers. To avoid negative press, the &quot;Schießbefehl&quot; was suspended for public holidays or state visits.

In 1968, the &quot;Einsatzkompanie&quot; was founded as a special unit of the Stasi dedicated to preventing the defection of guards from the Border Troops.

===Berlin Wall===
East Germany began to tighten its emigration laws during the 1950s, creating increasingly strict criteria for legal migration to non-Warsaw Pact countries, including requirements for de-registration with East German authorities and permission to leave the country under threat of prison sentences up to three years. The construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 saw the effective illegalization of &quot;Republikflucht&quot;, with the law only allowing legal border crossings at so-called &quot;Grenzübergangsstellen&quot; (&quot;checkpoints&quot;), and requests for migration received very limited approval from authorities. Checkpoint Charlie was special, since this was one of the few border crossing points in Berlin where foreigners could enter East Berlin. Elsewhere, warning signs were posted telling people not to enter the border zone, known as &quot;death strips&quot;, and any violation was considered a criminal act.

After construction of the Berlin Wall, with authorized travel by East Germans into West Germany and West Berlin incredibly difficult, the number of migrants dropped sharply from hundreds of thousands to only several hundred per year. The new migration system particularly discriminated against young East Germans, leading many to become motivated to attempt a desperate flight over the Inner German border despite the dangers.

==Deaths==
On 6 February 1989, &quot;Schießbefehl&quot; was formally abolished. Overall, an official total of about 260 people were killed attempting to cross at the Berlin Wall, at the main East-West border, or via the Baltic Sea. The exact number of fatalities is difficult to estimate (see Inner German border deaths) and an unknown number were seriously wounded and later arrested. Victims of this system also include border guards who were shot by fugitives and their supporters. In Berlin alone, 190 people were killed in the course of 28 years. The last-known person to have been shot at the Wall was Chris Gueffroy, while the very last victim of the Wall was Winfried Freudenberg, dead by falling from an improvised hot air balloon.

&quot;Schießbefehl&quot; occurrences at the border were also recorded by the &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; (&quot;BGS&quot; or &quot;Federal Border Guard&quot;, the West German border guards), the West Berlin police, and by the military police of the Allied Forces. Files were collected in the central registration office at Salzgitter.

==Reunification==
After German reunification in October 1990, the &quot;Todesschützen&quot; (&quot;death shooters&quot;: soldiers who allegedly killed those attempting to escape East Germany) were brought to trial in the federal courts in what were known as the &quot;Mauerschützen-Prozesse&quot; (&quot;Wall shooters trials&quot;). Also, high-ranking officers of the Border Troops and the East German National Defense Council were charged in court. The verdicts generally agreed that even the common soldier should have and must have recognised that the East German border laws were so fundamentally in conflict with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which East Germany had signed and ratified, that they were not law at all but formalized injustice, and thus the soldiers ought to have disobeyed their commanding officers.

==Inuit==

Inuit are Indigenous Canadian peoples who were isolated from Europeans longer than other indigenous groups. This is because they live in a cold and remote part of the world called Inuit Nunangat, the large territory encompassing all Inuit regions in Canada. Nunavik, the Quebec part of Inuit Nunangat, is where all of Quebec&#x27;s northern village municipalities (&quot;Municipalité de village nordique&quot;, abbreviated as VN are located and the residents are almost all Inuit and are known as &quot;Nunavimmiut&quot; . 

There are 14 Inuit northern villages, all of which are coastal and regulated by the Kativik Regional Government:
* Akulivik
* Aupaluk
* Inukjuak
* Ivujivik
* Kangiqsualujjuaq
* Kangirsuk
* Kuujjuaq
* Kuujjuarapik
* Puvirnituq
* Quaqtaq
* Salluit

In 2015, Quebec&#x27;s Inuit numbered 12,129 people. As of 2023, 98% of Nunavik&#x27;s residents speak &quot;Nunavimmiutitut&quot;, a local dialect of Inuktitut and part of the Eskaleut language family, as their native language. They also know English and French because they are taught these languages in school.

<doc id="947633" wikidata="Q654013" url="?curid=947633" title="No. 201 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 201 Squadron is a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It currently operates the Boeing Poseidon MRA1 from RAF Lossiemouth, Moray. 

It is the only squadron affiliated with Guernsey, in the Channel Islands. This affiliation started in 1935 and is commemorated in the museum on Castle Cornet. Its history goes even further back than the RAF itself, being formed originally as No. 1 Squadron RNAS on 17 October 1914. It had previously operated the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2, based at RAF Kinloss, Moray, between January 1982 and March 2010.

==History==
===Formation and World War I===
Despite its high squadron number, 201 Squadron is one of the oldest squadrons in the RAF. It was formed as No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) on 17 October 1914, and reformed under that designation on 6 December 1916, only being renumbered to 201 Squadron on the formation of the RAF on 1 April 1918 – all the RNAS squadrons getting new numbers by adding 200 to their original number.

A Victoria Cross was won by a member of No. 1 Squadron RNAS when on 7 June 1915 Sub-Lieutenant R.A.J. Warneford shot down Zeppelin LZ.37.

After the war the squadron was disbanded at RAF Eastleigh on 31 December 1919. Eighteen flying aces served in the squadron during the course of the war, including such notables as
Samuel Kinkead, 
Stanley Wallace Rosevear, 
Richard Minifie, 
Roderic Dallas, 
George Gates, 
Reginald Brading, 
Maxwell Findlay, 
Cyril Ridley, 
Thomas Gerrard, 
John Jones, James Henry Forman, 
Charles Dawson Booker, 
Thomas Culling, 
future Air Vice-Marshal F. H. Maynard, 
Robert McLaughlin, and
Hazel Wallace.

===Flying boat squadron===
The squadron was reformed at RAF Calshot on 1 January 1929 by expanding no. 480 Flight, a Supermarine Southampton flying boat unit. In April 1936 the Southamptons gave way to the Saro London, which the squadron still had on strength when World War II broke out. Supermarine Stranraers flew shortly with the squadron in 1939, but by April 1940 the squadron was operational on the Short Sunderland, which would remain the squadron equipment for almost seventeen years up till 28 February 1957, when the squadron was disbanded at RAF Pembroke Dock.

===Shackletons and Nimrods===
The squadron was reformed at RAF St. Mawgan, when No. 220 Squadron RAF was renumbered to 201 Squadron. The squadron flew the next twelve years with the Avro Shackleton MR.3, a version that used a tricycle undercarriage as opposed to the earlier tailwheel variants. Following the Shackleton&#x27;s retirement, the squadron converted to Nimrods in October 1970. 

The squadron was active for over a decade in the Gulf region, in support of both Gulf War 1 and 2 and more recently the conflict in Afghanistan. Until March 2010, the squadron was also on active duty in the UK and maintained continuous 24-hour/365-day search and rescue standby, shared with the sister 120 Squadron, both flying from RAF Kinloss. The Nimrod MR2 was withdrawn in March 2010, and the squadron was formally disbanded on 26 May 2011. It had been preparing to operate the Nimrod MRA4 but this aircraft was cancelled under the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review.

=== Reformation ===
In July 2017, it was announced that No. 201 Squadron would be one of two RAF squadrons to fly the P-8A Poseidon, based at RAF Lossiemouth. It was later confirmed the squadron would stand up in the &#x27;Summer of 2021&#x27; operating in the role and at location as previously stated. No. 201 Squadron reformed on 7 August 2021, reclaiming their Squadron Standard from Government House in Guernsey on 22 October.

<text>Danish overseas colonies and Dano-Norwegian colonies () were the colonies that Denmark–Norway (Denmark after 1814) possessed from 1537 until 1953. At its apex, the colonies spanned four continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America.

The period of colonial expansion marked a rise in the status and power of Danes and Norwegians in the Kalmar Union. Danes and Norwegians during this time increasingly saw themselves as citizens of the same &quot;State Fatherland&quot; (), the realm of the Oldenburg monarchs.

In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark–Norway began to develop forts with trading posts in West Africa, and colonies in the Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent. Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark–Norway&#x27;s overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe. Denmark–Norway&#x27;s first colony was established at Tranquebar () on India&#x27;s southern coast in 1620. Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony.

After 1814, when Norway was ceded to Sweden following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained what remained of Norway&#x27;s great medieval colonial holdings.

Today, the only remaining vestiges are two originally Norwegian dependencies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland&#x27;s colonial status ceased in 1953. They are now autonomous territories within the Kingdom of Denmark with home rule, in a relationship referred to as the &quot;Unity of the Realm&quot;.

==Overview==
===Africa===


Denmark-Norway maintained several trading stations and four forts along the Gold Coast in West Africa, especially around modern day Ghana. Three trading stations were built: Fort Frederiksborg, Kpompo; Fort Christiansborg near Accra in 1661, which was purchased from Sweden; and Frederiksberg. The forts were Fort Fredensborg (1734), Fort Kongenstein (1783), Fort Prinzenstein (1784), and Fort Augustaborg (1787), several of which exist as ruins today. Of these, only one is still in existence, the Osu Castle, which used to be the residence of Ghanaian presidents.

Plantations were established near Frederiksborg, but they failed. Fort Christiansborg became the base for Danish power in West Africa, and the centre for the slave trade to the Danish West Indies. In 1807, Denmark&#x27;s African business partners were suppressed by the Ashanti, which led to the abandonment of all trading stations. Denmark sold its forts to the United Kingdom in 1850.

====List====
* Fort Fredensborg (Ningo: 1734 – March 1850)

===Asia===


Denmark maintained a scattering of small colonies and trading posts throughout the Indian sub-continent from the 17th to 19th centuries, after which most were sold or ceded to Britain which had become the dominant power there. The most important economic aspect was spice trade and access to the east Asian area, including Imperial China situated farther to the east.

====Tranquebar (1620–1845)====



The colony at (modern day: Tharangambadi) was kept for over 200 years, with a few interruptions, until it was sold to the British in 1845.

====Serampore (1755–1845)====
In 1755, Denmark acquired the (now Serampore), and later the towns of Achne and Pirapur. They are located about north of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). In 1818, Serampore College was established in Serampore, which still exists today. These towns were also sold to Britain in 1845.

====Nicobar Islands (1756–1848/1868)====
There were also colonization attempts of the Nicobar Islands, called (&quot;Frederik Islands&quot;) or (&quot;New Denmark&quot;) by the Danes between 1754 and 1868.

===Europe===
====Iceland (1537/1814–1944)====


As with Greenland and the Faroe Islands, Norwegian claims to Iceland were inherited by Denmark–Norway. Also like those possessions, Iceland was retained by Denmark at the Treaty of Kiel. A growing independence movement in Iceland led to Denmark granting it home rule in 1874 and expanding that home rule in 1904. In 1918, Iceland became a fully sovereign kingdom, titled the &quot;Kingdom of Iceland&quot;, in personal union with Denmark.

During Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Denmark from 1940 to 1945, the Republic of Iceland was declared on 17 June 1944 after the result of a referendum.

====Faroe Islands (1537/1814–present)====
As with Greenland, Denmark–Norway inherited the medieval Norwegian claims to the Faroe Islands as the successor state to Norway. The Faroes had become part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. After Norway was given to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the Faroes as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel. The Faroe Islands were incorporated into Denmark in 1851 with the implementation of the Danish constitution.
===North America===


====Danish West Indies (1666–1917)====
Denmark–Norway acquired the island of St. Thomas in 1671 and St. Jan (now St. John) in 1718, and bought St. Croix from France in 1733. All of the islands&#x27; economies were based primarily on sugar. These islands were known as the Danish West Indies and were eventually sold to the United States in 1917 for 25 million dollars. Several Danish-American succession talks had been made since 1870 due to a rising number of riots and unrest from the poorer English-speaking population. The Zahle Government (1914–1920) held a heavily boycotted election for Danish mainland constituencies, which produced a minority for the sale of the islands. The United States hoped to use them as naval bases. Since 1917, the islands have been known as the United States Virgin Islands.

====Greenland (1814–present)====


Greenland was settled by immigrants from Iceland and Norway in the Viking Age after the arrival of Erik the Red in 995 or 996. Medieval Greenland was a bishopric with 22 churches and 2 convents under the archdiocese of Nidaros. In 1261, the Greenlanders became subjects of the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397). With the ratification of the Kalmar Union in 1397, Denmark–Norway inherited Greenland. After the Norse settlement in Greenland finally disappeared in the 15th century, Europeans did not settle the island again until 1721, when the Lutheran minister Hans Egede arrived and established the town now known as Nuuk. After Norway was ceded to the king of Sweden in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the old territorial claims as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel.

The development and settlement of Greenland accelerated in 1945, instigated by the region&#x27;s geostrategic importance in the Cold War era, itself exemplified and manifested by the U.S. Air Base of Thule from 1943. Another reason and driving force was the emergence of fundamental technical abilities, such as aircraft and icebreakers at Greenland&#x27;s disposition, giving the otherwise remote island a supply situation somewhat similar to Europe.

Following a period of increasing integration in the 19th century, Greenland was incorporated into Denmark in 1953 with the implementation of the Danish constitution.

==Legacy==
Greenland and the Faroe Islands were the last vestiges of the colonial empire. Greenland&#x27;s colonial status ceased in 1953, becoming an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It gained home rule in 1979 and further autonomy, including self-determination, in 2009. Likewise, the Faroes were incorporated into the Kingdom in 1816, with the status of a county, and then given home rule in 1948.

<text>No. 42 Squadron, also known as No. 42 (Torpedo Bomber) Squadron or No. 42 (TB) Squadron, is a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It reformed at RAF Lossiemouth on 21 September 2023 as the Operational Conversion Unit for both the Boeing Poseidon MRA1 and Boeing Wedgetail AEW1.

The squadron served during the First World War as an army co-operation squadron and during the Second World War in various roles. Between 1992 and 2010, it was based at RAF Kinloss as the Operational Conversion Unit for the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2, until the retirement of the aircraft in March 2010.

==History==

===First World War===
Formed on 1 April 1916 from crews of No. 19 Squadron Royal Flying Corps at RAF Filton, No. 42 Squadron spent the First World War flying reconnaissance sorties. Using Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2s (and later Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8s), the squadron spent time on both the Western Front and the Austro-Italian Front. On returning to England after the war, the squadron was disbanded at RAF Netheravon on 26 June 1919.

The squadron was based at La Gorgue in northern France from 1 September to 8 November 1916.

===Second World War===

On 14 December 1936, &#x27;B&#x27; flight of No. 22 Squadron was expanded into a new No. 42 Squadron. In 1939, No. 42 Squadron was based at RAF Bircham Newton. Initially the unit was equipped with Vickers Vildebeests before re-equipping with Bristol Beauforts in January 1940. The squadron operated also a bomber unit in the Burma campaign flying Blenheims during 1942 and as a fighter-bomber unit flying Hawker Hurricanes during 1943. The squadron disbanded on 30 June 1945 but on the following day No. 146 Squadron was renumbered to No. 42 Squadron and flew Republic Thunderbolts Mk.IIs. The squadron fought on with these until the Burma campaign ended and thereafter the squadron disbanded on 30 December 1945 at Meiktela.

===Post-War===
====Beaufighters and Shackletons (1946–1971)====
On 1 October 1946, No. 254 Squadron at RAF Thorney Island was renumbered to No. 42 Squadron. Equipped with Bristol Beaufighter, it was a strike unit in RAF Coastal Command until disbanded on 15 October 1947.

On 28 June 1952, No. 42 Squadron was reformed at RAF St. Eval, Cornwall, flying Avro Shackleton MR.1s in the maritime reconnaissance role. In 1954, the squadron began to re-equip with the Shackleton MR.2. On 11 January 1955, two squadron Shackleton MR.2s (&quot;WG531&quot; and &quot;WL743&quot;) disappeared while operating near Fastnet Rock. No. 42 Squadron Shackletons used to regularly visit RAF Khormaksar in Aden before the Aden Emergency, with it undertaking colonial policing.

No. 42 Squadron relocated to RAF St. Mawgan in October 1958. In 1961, the squadron deployed to Jamaica to provide support for relief operations after Hurricane Hattie struck the Caribbean and British Honduras. It further converted to the Shackleton MR.3 in December 1965. In 1966, No. 42 Squadron deployed to Mahajanga, Malagasy Republic, to take part in the Beira Patrol which enforced the blockade of the port of Beira in Mozambique to prevent oil shipments to Rhodesia.

====Nimrods (1971–2011)====
In April 1971, No. 42 (Torpedo Bomber) Squadron began to convert to the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.1. 

No. 42 (TB) Squadron were the first Nimrod unit to arrive at Wideawake Airfield, Ascension Island, when &quot;XV244&quot; and &quot;XV258&quot; landed on 6 April 1982 shortly after the invasion of the Falkland Islands. In October 1984, one of No. 42 (TB) Squadron&#x27;s crews won the Fincastle Trophy at RAAF Base Edinburgh, South Australia. On 29 August 1985, Nimrod MR.2 &quot;XV229&quot; helped locate the wreck of &quot; Virgin Atlantic Challenger&quot;.

In June 1990, No. 42 (TB) Squadron won the Fincastle Trophy once again, this time at CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia. In October 1990, the squadron deployed its crews to Seeb International Airport, Oman, and later to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, in January 1991 as part of Operation Granby. Nimrod MR.2 &quot;XV244&quot; (&quot;Battle Star 42&quot;) was credited with 14 mission markings and four ship kills while deployed. One of the squadron&#x27;s crews were credited with having achieved the highest number of assisted kills – six, achieved operating in a High Air Threat environment.

Disbanded as a front-line unit in October 1992, it was later reformed as No. 42 (Reserve) Squadron at RAF Kinloss, Moray, taking over from No. 236 OCU as the Nimrod Operational Conversion Unit (OCU). 

No. 42 (R) Squadron made the Nimrod&#x27;s last visit to Gibraltar on 20/21 March 2010 as part of Operation Active Endeavour. The squadron flew its last Nimrod MR.2 flight on 30 March 2010 with &quot;XV232&quot; visiting Rockall, St. Kilda, RAF St. Mawgan, RAF Valley and RAF Lossiemouth. It was originally expected that No. 42 (R) Squadron would serve as the OCU for the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA.4, however it was cancelled as part of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, with No. 42 (R) Squadron formally disbanding alongside the other Nimrod units on 26 May 2011.

====Poseidon and Wedgetail OCU (2023–present)====
The unit was reformed as No. 42 (Torpedo Bomber) Squadron on 21 September 2023 at RAF Lossiemouth, Moray. The squadron is the Operational Conversion Unit for both the Boeing Poseidon MRA1 and Boeing Wedgetail AEW1. No. 42 (TB) Squadron&#x27;s first Poseidon sortie was flown on 26 September 2023.

<doc id="947648" wikidata="Q17012244" url="?curid=947648" title="New Covenant Ministries International">
<text>New Covenant Ministries International (NCMI) is an international non-denominational Christian church network founded by Dudley Daniel in South Africa in the early 1980s, currently led by Tyrone Daniel, and active in about 100 countries. NCMI defines itself as a trans-local ministry team which helps pastors/elders build their local churches and equip Christian believers. Independent commentators tend to describe NCMI as not just this team of leaders, but the network of all affiliated churches who partner (previously &quot;relate&quot;) to the NCMI team, and say it has some characteristics of a denomination. Unlike most denominations, individual churches affiliated with NCMI retain their autonomy and are not required to sign a common constitution or statement of beliefs.

==Basis and beliefs==
NCMI&#x27;s foundational value is that the Bible (specifically, the Protestant canon) is the &quot;only acceptable standard for life, ministry, and conduct in the Church&quot;. As such, NCMI&#x27;s theology of church governance is that the early church as described in the New Testament is a God-ordained, prescriptive blueprint that modern local churches should follow. The NCMI &quot;translocal team&quot; (&quot;translocal&quot; refers to a team / person based in a local church who works in both a local region and internationally) believes in fivefold ministry, specifically the belief that the offices of apostle and prophet remain active and valid in the contemporary church, on the basis of . In this sense NCMI could be considered a charismatic restorationist movement.

===Statement of faith===
In their statement of faith, NCMI affirms typical Baptist and Pentecostal beliefs, including biblical inspiration; the Trinity; the humanity, divinity and resurrection of Jesus Christ; and substitutionary atonement. Distinctive beliefs include the movement&#x27;s view of church governance and the restoration of apostolic-prophetic teams. The statement avoids &quot;entrapment in a fixed eschatological view on dispensationalism&quot; and does not take a position on Reformed theology.

Partnering (previously &quot;relating&quot;) local churches are not required to adopt NCMI&#x27;s statement of faith, since in NCMI&#x27;s view that would be an imposition of authority. Some churches use NCMI&#x27;s statement of faith verbatim, while others write their own broadly compatible statements.

===Similar movements===

The beliefs of NCMI are not completely unique. Their theology and practices are also held by a number of other similar movements in varying degrees including: the International Churches of Christ (ICOC), Every Nation Churches and Ministries, Calvary Chapel, Salt and Light Ministries International, Newfrontiers, Ichthus Christian Fellowship and Link NZ.

==Involvement with local churches==
NCMI&#x27;s involvement provides otherwise autonomous churches with third party input (called &quot;invited authority&quot;), for both the congregation and church leaders. For the congregation, NCMI team members provide teaching, training in spiritual gifts, and &quot;equipping of the priesthood for works of service&quot;. For church leadership, NCMI help with doctrine, discipline, church direction, advice on financial matters such as setting elders&#x27; salaries, and training. Based on their belief that the local church is autonomous, NCMI says it only speaks into situations or problems in a local church by invitation or when fraud or heresy are alleged.

===Nature of relationship===
NCMI asks relating local churches to enter a &quot;primary, but not exclusive&quot; relationship with it, meaning that local churches may seek the input of other apostolic networks or individuals. Churches cannot &quot;join&quot; NCMI, since NCMI considers itself fundamentally a team of people, not a network of churches. NCMI considers its role to be supporting and encouraging local churches with compatibility vision and values.

NCMI do not require money from partnering churches, although they do accept donations to support the translocal team. They also do not provide charitable status or tax exemptions for churches, as this would restrict autonomy.

===Church leadership and governance===
Following their understanding of the biblical pattern, NCMI believes that local churches should be led by a plurality of elders, in partnership with a translocal apostolic-prophetic team, whether it is NCMI or another team. NCMI encourages prospective partnering churches to reorganize their church to this arrangement if it differs.

The plurality of elders will have a leader known as the &quot;lead elder&quot; or &quot;visionary elder&quot;, whose role is to develop a vision and then in consultation with the other elders give vision or direction to other leaders such as deacons and subsequently to their local church. The lead elder is usually, but not necessarily, the primary teacher. Elders are considered synonymous with &quot;pastors&quot;, and &quot;elder&quot; is the preferred term. All terms are said to describe the function performed, not the maturity of the officer.

NCMI discourages churches from making decisions through democratic processes, since they do not believe this is biblical.

====Titles and terminology====
NCMI discourages church members from using formal titles (such as &quot;Pastor Mark&quot; or &quot;Apostle Dudley&quot;) to refer to church leaders, whether the leader is a local church deacon or elder, or a member of the NCMI team. This interpretation is based on biblical texts where people were introduced by their first name and function, for example, &quot;Paul, an apostle&quot;, but never &quot;Apostle Paul&quot;. Members of the apostolic team often refrain from describing themselves with any label at all, instead allowing local churches to &quot;define the gifting as they perceive it&quot;.

Local churches are not allowed to use the acronym NCMI or its full definition in the name of the church. Formally, churches do not say they are &quot;NCMI churches&quot;, rather they &quot;partner with NCMI&quot;.

====Appointing elders====
NCMI encourages local church elders to follow a specific process for selecting new elders. The elders of the local church identify one or more men (women are not eligible) who meet the various scriptural requirements (for example: , and ) and according to Pole, &quot;have a proven track record of attending church meetings regularly, providing financial support..., exhibiting spiritual gifts and the fruit of the Holy Spirit... and supporting existing church leadership&quot;. The local church invites a member of the NCMI team to review and ultimately appoint or ordain the candidate(s), on the basis that only apostles may appoint or ordain elders (based on ). The local congregation is given an opportunity to express concerns. Elders, including elders who preach, are not expected to have formal theological or professional training, but may be encouraged to pursue it. NCMI team members also may be &quot;based&quot; in a local church but their function in the NCMI team is not supposed to make them superior to other elders nor does it mandate they fill the role of the &quot;lead&quot; elder.

Manley writes that in some cases &quot;when a lead elder leaves a church, [NCMI] will send a new lead elder and expect the existing eldership... to stand down...&quot; According to Manley, through their influence over appointing elders, replacing lead elders and monitoring church finances, the NCMI team effectively exerts hierarchical control over local churches similar to denominations.

====Criticism of leadership model====
Third parties and ex-members of NCMI have specifically criticized NCMI&#x27;s distinctive church leadership model.

Allan Anderson, professor of Mission and Pentecostal Studies, remarked that NCMI churches are &quot;highly patriarchal in leadership; leaders tend to make unilateral decisions based on the &#x27;leading of the [Holy] Spirit&#x27;.&quot;

Chris Wienand, former NCMI team member, wrote in 2009 of his NCMI experiences, &quot;the recent years saw us preoccupied with an ecclesiology that was &#x27;over realized&#x27;... We preached &#x27;model&#x27;, &#x27;pattern&#x27; passionately. But our God is gracious, kind and infinitely generous. He walked us back... to the gospel we had so sadly sent to the bookends of our convictions. After 25 years of pastoral ministry I had to admit to a wonderful community that I had erred.&quot;

===Church planting===
Church planting is a major component of NCMI&#x27;s understanding of the local church and church growth. NCMI founder Dudley Daniel wrote, &quot;an apostolic church has a mandate to see the church advancing in its witness to the world by fulfilling the Great Commission (), &quot;by planting churches&quot; in every town and village, making disciples of all nations.&quot; &quot;(Emphasis added.)&quot;

==History==

===Origins (1982–1990)===

NCMI started in South Africa, around 1982 with a group of church leaders meeting together in Bryanston, a suburb of Johannesburg, to build relationships and discuss issues in their churches. Dudley Daniel emerged as key influence in developing this group. In January 1983 the group, then comprising about ten churches in greater Johannesburg, ratified a constitution for &quot;New Covenant Ministries&quot; based on &quot;Bible Values&quot; with the South African government, enabling them to recognize local churches, appoint church ministers or functions, and acquire property. At this time, all local church elders were members of the &quot;covering body&quot; of New Covenant Ministries and local congregations were autonomous.

Starting in 1983, the movement became &quot;involved with missions, church planting, cross-cultural ministry, mission outreach, and mercy ministry to the poor [...] and to victims of disaster&quot;, including activities in neighbouring Swaziland, Mozambique and Lesotho. The movement also began to hold conferences and retreats for leaders of their churches, the precursor to Leadership Training Times, with Dudley Daniel providing much of the teaching.

By the late 1980s, the group had grown to about 70 relating church pastors. Around the same time, the apostolic-prophetic team emerged as a core group, distinct from the relating church pastors.

===International expansion (1990–2004)===
In 1990, the movement began to focus on international growth, appending &quot;International&quot; to its original name, &quot;New Covenant Ministries&quot;. Daniel relocated his family to Australia in the early 1990s, coinciding with the official abolishment of apartheid in South Africa. In 1996, the &quot;apostolic team&quot; counted 13 men and their wives.

In the late 1990s Daniel moved to Los Angeles, California to &quot;contribute to envisioning and equipping churches in the USA&quot;. By September 1999, Daniel was suffering from severe health problems. He and his wife returned to Adelaide in 2002.

By mid-2001, NCMI stated they had 7,000 relating churches located in over 80 countries around the world.

Attendance at the largest leadership training meeting in Bryanston grew from 1,000 people in 1990 to nearly in 5,000 in 2005, reflecting the movement&#x27;s overall growth.

Manley wrote that, in 2001, of the eight original signatories to New Covenant Ministries, only three remained in the movement, with only Dudley Daniel and Rigby Wallace at the forefront. Around this time Coastlands International Christian Centre (Adelaide) functioned as an unofficial headquarters and regional base for Australasia, with Southlands Church International (Los Angeles) and New Covenant Church (Bryanston) as regional bases for North America and southern Africa respectively.

In the mid-1990s, NCMI established the International Theological Correspondence College (ITCC), a correspondence college that worked in partnership with the South African Theological Seminary. The College offered a non-accredited program, containing only NCMI material and requiring no examination; and a fully accredited Diploma in Theology. In 2006, the College had 300 students enrolled. NCMI ceased operating ITCC by 2010.

===Tenure of Tyrone Daniel (2004–present)===
In 2004, Dudley Daniel and his Life Team selected Dudley&#x27;s son, Tyrone Daniel, as the successor. By 2005 the team had grown to 280 people. Tyrone also became the lead elder of Coastlands International Christian Centre. He eventually transferred its leadership to his brother, Jon Daniel.

In 2010, Tyrone Daniel relocated from Australia to the United States and established a new church plant, Redemption City Church in Denver, Colorado. In 2017, he transferred the leadership to Terry and Sandy Kreuger.

====Structure====
NCMI describes itself not as a group of churches, but a team of apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and evangelists (according to the list in ) who desire to help local autonomous churches grow into &quot;all God has for them&quot;. As mentioned above, NCMI team members are all based in a local church and work in and through their local church, but their function in the NCMI team is not supposed to make them superior to other elders nor does it mandate they fill the role of the &quot;lead&quot; elder.

In practice, the NCMI team is organised into smaller teams with responsibility for specific areas, and their ministry work includes organising conferences for teaching and disseminating their values, along with visiting relating local churches as guest speakers and to provide advice and support for local leadership. NCMI does not require donations from local churches but does accept them, both to individual guest speakers and to a decentralised ministry fund.

===Committees===
Manley states that by 2001, the initial idea of local church autonomy gave way to a &quot;bulky&quot; leadership structure of &quot;distinct hierarchies. The NCMI team as a whole was partitioned into smaller teams with authority in specific matters or regions. He acknowledges that NCMI has made an effort to describe and encourage non-hierarchical leadership structures.

These &quot;teams within the team&quot; and their responsibilities were:
* Governmental Teams
** Life Team – personal accountability group for Dudley and Ann Daniel
** Financial Team – oversight of international finances
** Consultants Team – working with Dudley and the Life Team to &quot;help give perspective to the broader ministry&quot;
** International Team – people able to travel and ordain elders
** General Ordaining Teams – people operating in specific geographic regions
* Non-Governmental Team – provide training and ministry in regional meetings, but excluded from &quot;governmental responsibility&quot; such as doctrinal issues, direction and discipline

NCMI continues to describe their structure as &quot;teams within the team&quot; with a variety of functions, but no longer provides details on how the teams are organized.

===Conferences===
A major part of NCMI&#x27;s work is facilitated through conferences organized by NCMI. According to Black, &quot;the effectiveness of the churches relating to NCMI is largely due to the high mobility of the Apostolic team and the ongoing connection through [Equips and smaller conferences].&quot; These conferences have no fixed agenda, but include worship, ministry of spiritual gifts, and teaching, usually led by a member of the apostolic team.

====&quot;Equip&quot; conferences====
NCMI hosts periodic &quot;Equip&quot; conferences around the world, and numerous smaller events in local regions.

In 2006, Equip conferences were hosted in 33 countries, covering North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and southeast Asia.

Leaders attending conferences or visiting other churches pay their own travel expenses and accommodations, meaning their home church must have the necessary finances to support their travel.

====Regional conferences====
A few times per year, NCMI-partnering churches will organize short, smaller scale &quot;Geographical Training Times&quot; (or &quot;Regional Training Times&quot;), usually under the ministry of one or two members of the NCMI team. Unlike Equip conferences these are not promoted internationally.

====Other conferences====
NCMI also holds training times for prospective NCMI team members and church planters.

===Official and legal organization===
NCMI does not maintain an official headquarters. Based on the lack of an official headquarters and the relational network of autonomous churches, they say that they are neither a denomination nor a movement.

Since NCMI finds no biblical precedent for voting on decisions, NCMI team members do not vote but rather make decisions by arriving at a consensus. They discourage relating local churches from either voting among the eldership, or permitting the congregation to vote on any decision.

NCMI does maintain a website, various legal entities in countries in which it operates, and a post office box in Colorado, U.S.A.

== Criticism ==
Allan Anderson, professor of Mission and Pentecostal Studies, wrote in 2005 that NCMI is &quot;dominated by white South Africans, who lead many local churches and church plants around the world, preside over NCMI conferences, and predominate the membership of the apostolic team&quot;. Speaking of South African Pentecostalism in general and explicitly mentioning NCMI, Anderson contrasts the rise of expensive megachurches and &quot;jet-set&quot; apostolic networks in white, middle-class South Africa to the poverty of majority black Pentecostals. He says that as of 2005, South African Pentecostal churches were still divided along ethnic lines and were not &quot;proactive with regard to such severe social problems as the AIDS pandemic, rising poverty and crime&quot;. In Anderson&#x27;s view, these churches are &quot;not making an impact nor addressing challenges posed by a rapidly changing [post-apartheid South African] society&quot;.

<text>The University of Tampa (UTampa, UT or Tampa U) is a private university in Tampa, Florida. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. UTampa offers more than 200 programs of study, including 19 master&#x27;s degrees and a broad variety of majors, minors, pre-professional programs and certificates.

The school began as a junior college housed in a local high school in 1931, then moved to its current location and expanded to become a four-year university in 1933. UTampa grew gradually in the following decades. Since the turn of the 21st century, it has expanded and extensively modernized its campus while increasing enrollment to over 11,000 students.

The school&#x27;s central building, Plant Hall, once housed the Tampa Bay Hotel, a resort built by Henry B. Plant in 1891. The Moorish minarets atop the distinctive structure have long been a symbol of Tampa.

== History ==
===Tampa Junior College===
In 1931, Frederic H. Spaulding, the principal of Tampa&#x27;s Hillsborough High School, established the private &quot;Tampa Junior College&quot; to serve as one of the first institutions of higher education in the Tampa Bay area. The college offered a limited selection of degree programs, with most classes held in the evening on the campus of Hillsborough High School.

===Move and name change===
Two years later, the school moved to its current location on the grounds of the recently closed Tampa Bay Hotel, which Henry B. Plant had built in 1891 directly across the Hillsborough River from downtown Tampa. The sprawling resort initially featured a quarter-mile long main building with over 500 guest rooms along with several adjoining buildings and amenities ranging from an indoor pool to a casino to a race track, all spread across six acres of land. After some initial success, however, it struggled to consistently attract enough patrons to make a profit, The city of Tampa purchased the hotel after Plant&#x27;s death and kept it open by contracting out daily operations to private companies, but it finally shut down in 1931 due to a significant downturn in tourism with the coming of the Great Depression. In 1933, the city agreed to allow Tampa Junior College to move its operations to the former hotel grounds rather than let the iconic buildings remain empty.

With the move to a much larger facility, Tampa Junior College became the University of Tampa (UT) and expanded its course offerings, and Spaulding resigned his position at Hillsborough High School to run the university full time. In 1905, the City of Tampa purchased the Tampa Bay Hotel and 150 acres of land for $125,000. In 1933, the University leased the former Tampa Bay Hotel from the City of Tampa. As part of the agreement between the City and the University, the south wing of the first floor became the Tampa Municipal Museum. The Museum was renamed the Henry B. Plant Museum in 1974.

===Gradual growth===
The university grew slowly over the next few decades, becoming a well-respected institution of learning that predominantly served students from the greater Tampa Bay area. In 1951, the university received full accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). While The University of Tampa succeeded academically, it faced intermittent financial difficulties for several decades. These problems first surfaced soon after its establishment, as the deepening Great Depression decreased enrollment and strained the new school&#x27;s ability to educate students while continuing to convert much of Plant Hall from hotel rooms into educational spaces. Another crisis several decades later forced a 1974 decision to fold the successful University of Tampa Spartans football program because the school could no longer afford the cost of competing in NCAA Division I-A football.

In 1986, local businessman Bruce Samson dropped out of Tampa&#x27;s mayoral campaign to become UT&#x27;s president, a position he was offered due in part to his background in banking and finance. Samson successfully eliminated the school&#x27;s $1.4 million annual budget deficit through &quot;hardnosed&quot; decisions, including withdrawing from all NCAA Division I sports. However, after he left in 1991 to return to private business, the school again fell into financial difficulties. Declining enrollment led to the return of serious budget deficits, leading to serious cuts to faculty positions and academic programs. UT faced an uncertain future, and some local leaders suggested that the cross-town public University of South Florida should take over operations of the long-time private school.

===Modern expansions===
In 1995, the Board of Trustees elected Ronald L. Vaughn, then dean of UT&#x27;s College of Business, as the school&#x27;s new president. His initial efforts were aimed at bringing the campus up-to-date with new dorms and a major renovation to the business school. Vaughn also launched the &quot;Take UT to the Top&quot; campaign with the goal of raising $70 million in 10 years and restoring the University&#x27;s endowment. The campaign raised $83 million, and later observers credit this successful fund drive with saving and modernizing the university. Two important contributions came from the John H. Sykes family of Tampa - a gift of $10 million in 1997 and another donation of $28 million in 2000, which was thought to be the largest such gift to a Florida university at the time.

Since becoming financially secure, the school has purchased adjacent land, added new facilities, and extensively modernized older ones; over $575 million in construction has been completed on campus since 1998. The university has also hired additional faculty, permitting the school to expand its student population while maintaining a 17:1 student-faculty ratio.

== Academics ==

UT offers 200 areas of study for undergraduate and graduate students. Classes maintain a 17:1 student-faculty ratio. UT employs no teaching assistants.

Some of UT&#x27;s most popular majors include international business, biology, marketing, marine science, criminology, finance, communication, psychology, sport management, entrepreneurship and nursing. UT recently launched a new major in cybersecurity.

The university is organized into four colleges: College of Arts and Letters; College of Social Sciences, Mathematics and Education; College of Natural and Health Sciences; and Sykes College of Business, which is accredited at the undergraduate and graduate levels by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

The University of Tampa has an Honors Program, which &quot;allows students to go beyond the classroom and regular course work to study one-on-one with faculty through enrichment tutorials, Honors Abroad, internships, research and classroom-to-community outreach.&quot;

UT also offers a host of international study-abroad options led by UT professors. The university is an associate member of the European Council of International Schools (ECIS).

===ROTC===
For UT undergraduates desiring to be commissioned as officers in the U.S. Army following graduation, the campus is home to an Army ROTC unit. For those students wishing to be commissioned as officers in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force upon graduation, cross-campus agreements are in place for UT students to affiliate with either the Naval ROTC unit or Air Force ROTC Detachment 158 at the University of South Florida.

===Rankings===
Forbes ranked The University of Tampa as #433 in the United States overall as of 2019. The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2019 rankings placed UT as #20 in the Regional Universities South category, compared to the 149 other universities listed in that category. In 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked The University of Tampa #13 in the Regional Universities South category. In 2022-23, UT was ranked #21 in the Regional Universities South category by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report.&quot;

== Campus ==

UT&#x27;s campus features 60 buildings on 110 landscaped acres. Plant Hall – a National Historic Landmark built in 1891 by Henry B. Plant – is a leading example of Moorish Revival architecture in the southeastern United States and a focal point of downtown Tampa. In addition to serving as a main location of classrooms and faculty and administrative offices, the building is also home to the Henry B. Plant Museum. The campus also includes the former McKay Auditorium, built in the 1920s and remodeled in the late 1990s to become the Sykes College of Business. In the last 16 years, since 1998, UT has invested approximately $575 million in new residence halls, classrooms, labs and other facilities.

The UT campus is relatively small for a school with 11,047 students. On its east side is the Hillsborough River, and Kennedy Boulevard is to the south. Recent expansions have seen the campus grounds move northward and eastward following purchases of sections of Tampa Preparatory School and vacant lots across the east-side railroad tracks.

Although the university is located in a major metropolitan area, palm trees, stately oaks, rose bushes and azaleas can be found in abundance on campus. UT&#x27;s grounds include Plant Park, a landscaped, palm-tree-lined riverside area in front of Plant Hall&#x27;s main entrance. It features cannons from Tampa&#x27;s original harbor fort and the Sticks of Fire sculpture. It also is home to the oak tree under which Hernando de Soto supposedly met the chief of the local Native American tribes upon first coming ashore at what is now Tampa. The campus also includes the former Florida State Fair grounds, where legend has it Babe Ruth hit a home run of , the longest of his career.

UT is also one of few schools with an anti-gravity monument from Roger Babson&#x27;s Gravity Research Foundation. The &quot;Anti-Gravity Rock&quot;, as it is commonly referred to, is located on the crosswalk between the College of Business parking lot and the Macdonald–Kelce Library, at the very end of the Science wing of Plant Hall. The stone&#x27;s location is somewhat ironic, yet appropriate, given that Babson&#x27;s scientific views were shared by few if any scientists.

=== Residence halls ===

About 60% of full-time UT students live on the university&#x27;s main campus. All but 3 of the 12 on-campus residence halls have been built since 1998.
Straz Hall and Palm Apartments offer apartment-style living, with each student having a private room but sharing a bathroom, kitchen and common area with three others. Five dorms, Smiley Hall, McKay Hall, Boathouse, Austin Hall and Vaughn Center, offer traditional dormitory arrangements, with two or three students in a connected suite sharing a bathroom and open living areas. Three halls, Brevard Hall, Morsani Hall and Jenkins Hall, offer a hybrid package with students sharing a common area but without a kitchen. Finally, Urso Hall provides students with what is essentially a studio apartment, a private suite consisting of a bed, closet, kitchenette and restroom. Every residence hall also offers a small assortment of private single rooms.

The Barrymore Hotel, located about from campus, also houses some students. Two students typically stay in each room, which is equipped with two double beds, a bathroom and closet space. UT&#x27;s wireless internet is available, along with cable television. A shuttle bus provides transportation to/from campus, or students can take the 15-minute walk.

=== Facilities ===
UT has about 50 computer labs and wireless Internet access across campus. The Sykes College of Business, in addition to housing a computer lab, has a stock market lab, equipped with terminals and plasma screen TVs for teaching finance majors the intricacies of the stock market. The College of Natural and Health Sciences maintains a remote marine science research center on Tampa Bay with extensive equipment including research vessels used by students and faculty for studying the ecosystems of Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.

The Macdonald–Kelce Library houses more than 275,000 books and 65,181 periodicals, as well as online research databases, a computer lab, study rooms and special collections, including Florida military materials, old and rare books, and local history and UT archives. The library also offers reference assistance and bibliographic instruction, interlibrary loans and reserve materials.

For student recreation there is a new Fitness and Recreation Center, a two-floor, 60,000 square foot space featuring six exercise rooms, including indoor cycling, functional training and yoga. There is also an on-campus aquatic center, the pool has a deep swimming section for scuba classes; it is open to students at limited times. UT offers sand volleyball courts, outdoor basketball courts, a fully equipped intramural sports gym with indoor courts, intramural softball fields, tennis courts, a ropes course, a soccer field, a running track, intramural baseball fields, a multi-use intramural field and a fully equipped workout center. The university has been recognized for being a green business, by the US Green Building Council with several facilities holding an LEED certification.

UT&#x27;s theater department hosts student produced and acted plays across Kennedy Boulevard in the historic Falk Theatre. Falk also hosts large academic gatherings, student productions and concerts. In 2003 Falk Theatre was featured as a setting in the film &quot;The Punisher&quot;.

The non-denominational Sykes Chapel and Center for Faith and Values includes a 250-seat main hall, meeting and meditation rooms, pipe organ by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders, a plaza and 60-bell musical sculpture/fountain.

The Bob Martinez Athletics Center received substantial upgrades during recent improvements throughout the university.

== Students ==

UT has approximately 11,047 students from 50 U.S. states and most of the world’s countries. A significant number of students come from northern and northeastern states while about 15% of the student body is made up of international students. Students from Florida make up about half of the student body. 60% of full-time students live in campus housing.

== Athletics ==

The University of Tampa competes at the Division II level in the Sunshine State Conference (SSC). The school&#x27;s mascot is the Spartan.

Spartan teams have won a combined total of 20 NCAA Division II National Titles, as follows: seven in baseball (1992, 1993, 1998, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015, 2019), three in men&#x27;s soccer (1981, 1994, 2001), two in golf (1987, 1988), three in volleyball (2006, 2014, 2018), one in beach volleyball (2019), one in women&#x27;s soccer (2007), one in men&#x27;s lacrosse (2022), and one in men&#x27;s swimming and diving (2023).

UT presently competes in baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, beach volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cheerleading/dance, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s rowing, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track, and women&#x27;s volleyball. UT athletes are among the top in the SSC in terms of All-American, All-Region, and All-Conference players along with numerous Commissioner&#x27;s Honor Roll recipients. The school has recently built dedicated stadiums for baseball, softball, soccer, track, and lacrosse that rival many Division I facilities. The men&#x27;s club hockey team competes in the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). UT&#x27;s equestrian team competes in the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA).

===Tampa Spartans football===

The University of Tampa fielded the first college football team in the Tampa Bay area in 1933, soon after the school was founded. The &quot;Tampa U&quot; Spartans played at Plant Field their first three seasons, which had to be shared with many community events. In 1936, the school built its own facility in Phillips Field, which was named for local businessman I. W. Phillips, who donated a plot of land adjacent to the university for the stadium site.

For over 30 years, the Spartans primarily scheduled games against other smaller southern colleges as an independent in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and its forerunners. In 1967, the school decided to compete at the highest level of college football in NCAA Division I and moved their home field to Tampa Stadium, which had just been completed. The Spartans produced several NFL stars in this era including John Matuszak and Freddie Solomon while building a sizeable local following. However, the school had only about 2000 students in the early 1970s and struggled to afford the expenses of a maintaining a major college football program.

When Tampa was awarded a new NFL franchise in 1974 (the eventual Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Tampa U president B.D. Owens reported to the university&#x27;s board that attendance at Spartans&#x27; games was likely to decrease, further impacting the school&#x27;s finances. Accordingly, the board voted to fold the Spartan football program after the 1974 season. The football program finished with an all-time record of 201–160–12.

<doc id="947652" wikidata="Q1057805" url="?curid=947652" title="James Taylor Quartet">
<text>The James Taylor Quartet (or JTQ) are a British four-piece jazz funk band formed in 1985 by Hammond organ player James Taylor following the break-up of his former band the Prisoners, and in the wake of Stiff Records&#x27; bankruptcy. The band consists of James Taylor (organ), Mark Cox (guitar), Andrew McKinney (bass), and Pat Illingworth (drums). Recordings and live performances often include vocalist Yvonne Yanney.

==Film theme beginnings==

The James Taylor Quartet&#x27;s first single, &quot;Blow-Up&quot; (a funked-up version of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s main theme from the seminal 1960s film of the same name), was released in 1987 on the Re Elect the President label, which would later become the Acid Jazz label. The track was championed by the &quot;NME&quot; and John Peel, appearing in Peel&#x27;s Festive Fifty chart for 1987. The band&#x27;s debut seven track mini album, &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; (1987) followed and predominantly comprised covers of 1960s film themes such as &quot;Alfie&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in a rough, up-tempo, almost punk-like style, that was primarily focused on Taylor&#x27;s Hammond organ playing. Their second album, &quot;The Money Spyder&quot; (1987), was the soundtrack to an imaginary spy film, applying the band&#x27;s style to Taylor&#x27;s own compositions.

While promoting these albums, the James Taylor Quartet developed a reputation as a live band. The live set emphasized on rhythm driven music, with elements of modern dance music, despite including a lot of improvised solos. The band recorded their signature tune &quot;The Theme from &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;&quot; featuring Fred Wesley and Pee Wee Ellis of the JBs in 1988 and this was included on their next album &quot;Wait a Minute&quot; (1988). Their popularity as a live act led to the release of the live album &quot;Absolute – JTQ Live&quot; in 1991, which attempted to capture the experience of the band in concert (even though it was recorded &#x27;live&#x27; in the studio, the audience cheering being overdubbed later).

==Emergence of acid jazz==
In the early 1990s, the band changed direction and released a string of song-based albums to appeal to the then fashionable soul and acid jazz scene in the UK. They featured vocalists such as Rose Windross of Soul II Soul, Alison Limerick and Noel McKoy. McKoy became a permanent member of the band for part of this period. The single &quot;Love the Life&quot; reached the top 40 and the accompanying album &quot;Supernatural Feeling&quot; (1993) reached the top 30 on the UK Albums Chart. The next album &quot;In the Hand of the Inevitable&quot; (1995), featuring Alison Limerick as guest vocalist on three songs, saw a return to the Acid Jazz label, where it remains the label&#x27;s biggest selling album.

==Return to funk roots==

Since then, the James Taylor Quartet have returned to their original style of instrumental Hammond-led jazz funk workouts on albums. Cover versions such as &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;&#x27; are still recorded in the same spirit as the band&#x27;s debut &quot;Blow-Up&quot; single, but the albums are mainly original compositions. Live gigs regularly feature a vocalist and showcase songs from the soul period of the band. They received a Music of Black Origin nomination for their second live album &quot;Whole Lotta Live&quot; (1998).

==Collaborations and other projects==

The James Taylor Quartet produced a bona-fide film theme of their own, when they contributed to the soundtrack of the first &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film. As well as their own recordings, James Taylor and members of the quartet have collaborated with Tom Jones on the duets album &quot;Reload&quot; and featured on records by the Wonder Stuff, Manic Street Preachers, the Pogues, Kingmaker and U2. They were also the house band on Gaby Roslin&#x27;s short-lived Channel 4 chat show in 1996.

In the late 1990s, James Taylor began composing and recording library music for the Bruton Music company. A series of releases were made available for use by the media industry in TV advertisements, programmes, films etc. 

The James Taylor Quartet have also released three albums under the name New Jersey Kings. These are similar in style to the core funky Hammond sound of JTQ, but have tended to be recorded live in the studio resulting in a more natural yet raw sound.

Some performances during 2005 included an augmented horn section and have been promoted as the James Taylor Funk Orchestra. During 2005, Nigel Price (guitar) replaced David Taylor.

==&quot;Soundtrack from Electric Black&quot;==

As part of the EFG London Jazz Festival, the James Taylor Quartet were backed by a full orchestra when they played at Cadogan Hall in London on 21 November 2018 for the premiere performance of their new album &quot;Soundtrack from Electric Black&quot;, which preceded the album&#x27;s release on 30 November on Audio Network.

It was originally intended for production use only, but Audio Network decided to put &quot;Soundtrack from Electric Black&quot; forward for a full commercial release.

<doc id="947655" wikidata="Q4862655" url="?curid=947655" title="Baron Mountjoy">
<text>The titles of Baron Mountjoy and Viscount Mountjoy have been created several times for members of various families, including the Blounts and their descendants and the Stewarts of Ramelton and their descendants.

The first creation was for Walter Blount of Hertfordshire, who was summoned to Parliament as Baron Mountjoy in the Peerage of England during 1465. The Blounts were a junior part of the family Blount of Sodington of Worcestershire. The first Baron was the great-grandson of Sir John Blount of Sodington and Isolda Mountjoy, and the grandson of Sir Walter Blount, bearer of the Royal Standard of Henry IV at the Battle of Shrewsbury during 1403 where he was slain. This creation is one of the earliest examples of a baronial title not being related to land ownership or a pre-existing dignity.

The 8th Baron Mountjoy was created Earl of Devon during 1603 and died without legitimate issue during 1606, when the earldom and the barony became extinct. His son Mountjoy Blount, who had been born before his parents&#x27; marriage, was created Baron Mountjoy of Mountjoy Fort in the Peerage of Ireland during 1618, Baron Mountjoy of Thurveston in the Peerage of England during 1627 and [[Earl of Newport]] in the Peerage of England during 1628. All these titles became extinct with the death of the 3rd Earl of Newport in 1681.

Elizabeth Blount, sister of the 2nd Baron Mountjoy of the 1465 creation, had married the 1st Baron Windsor, and their descendant Thomas Windsor, 1st Viscount Windsor in the Peerage of Ireland and younger son of the 7th Baron Windsor and 1st Earl of Plymouth, was created Baron Mountjoy in the Peerage of Great Britain during 1712. This title became extinct on the death of his son the 2nd Viscount Windsor in 1758.

Luke Gardiner (1745–1798), was created Baron Mountjoy during 1789 and Viscount Mountjoy during 1795, both part of the peerage of Ireland.

Another title of Viscount Mountjoy was created (and it is still extant) in 1796 for the first Marquess of Bute who married the grand-daughter of the 2nd Viscount Windsor and Baron Mountjoy.

<text>The Coxswain Insignia ( ) is a qualification device of the United States Coast Guard which is issued to enlisted personnel who qualify as a coxswain. The Coxswain on a Coast Guard Small Boat is in charge of the vessel and all personnel on board. Coxswains, while underway, operate without regard to rank or seniority. A Coxswain in the Coast Guard has a responsibility that is normally only undertaken by officers in other branches of the military. 

The Coxswain Insignia and the Surfman Badge may not be worn simultaneously. The United States Navy equivalent of the Coxswain badge is the Small Craft Enlisted Pin.

The Coxswain Pin can be awarded Temporarily or Permanently. To be awarded the Coxswain Insignia permanently a member has to have 5 years of certification with at least 2 years on a Standard Boat and retain certification by retaking and passing the appropriate tests. 

The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary also issues its own version of the insignia. The insignia is similar to the Coast Guard version but is bronze instead of pewter, and has the Auxiliary insignia located in the center of the device in place of the compass rose.

<text>Ivy Mike was the codename given to the first full-scale test of a thermonuclear device, in which a significant fraction of the explosive yield comes from nuclear fusion.
Ivy Mike was detonated on November 1, 1952, by the United States on the island of Elugelab in Enewetak Atoll, in the now independent island nation of the Marshall Islands, as part of Operation Ivy. It was the first full test of the Teller–Ulam design, a staged fusion device.

Due to its physical size and fusion fuel type (cryogenic liquid deuterium), the &quot;Mike&quot; device was not suitable for use as a deliverable weapon. It was intended as a &quot;technically conservative&quot; proof of concept experiment to validate the concepts used for multi-megaton detonations.

Samples from the explosion had traces of the isotopes plutonium-246, plutonium-244, and the predicted elements einsteinium and fermium.

==Schedule==
Beginning with the Teller–Ulam breakthrough in March 1951, there was steady progress made on the issues involved in a thermonuclear explosion and there were additional resources devoted to staging, and political pressure towards seeing, an actual test of a hydrogen bomb. A date within 1952 seemed feasible. In October 1951 physicist Edward Teller pushed for July 1952 as a target date for a first test, but project head Marshall Holloway thought October 1952, a year out, was more realistic given how much engineering and fabrication work the test would take and given the need to avoid the summer monsoon season in the Marshall Islands. On June 30, 1952, United States Atomic Energy Commission chair Gordon Dean showed President Harry S. Truman a model of what the Ivy Mike device would look like; the test was set for November 1, 1952.

One attempt to significantly delay the test, or not hold it at all, was made by the State Department Panel of Consultants on Disarmament, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, who felt that avoiding a test might forestall the development of a catastrophic new weapon and open the way for new arms agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union. The panel lacked political allies in Washington, however, and no test delay was made on this account.

There was a separate desire voiced for a very short delay in the test, for more political reasons: it was scheduled to take place just a few days before the 1952 presidential election. Truman wanted to keep the thermonuclear test away from partisan politics but had no desire to order a postponement of it himself; however he did make it known that he would be fine if it was delayed past the election due to &quot;technical reasons&quot; being found. Atomic Energy Commission member Eugene M. Zuckert was sent to the Enewetak test site to see if such a reason could be found, but weather considerations – on average there were only a handful of days each month that were suitable for the test – indicated it should go ahead as planned, and in the end no schedule delay took place.

==Device design and preparations==

The &quot;Mike&quot; device was a building that resembled a factory rather than a weapon. It has been reported that Soviet engineers derisively referred to &quot;Mike&quot; as a &quot;thermonuclear installation&quot;.

The device was designed by Richard Garwin, a student of Enrico Fermi, on the suggestion of Edward Teller. It had been decided that nothing other than a full-scale test would validate the idea of the Teller-Ulam design. Garwin was instructed to use very conservative estimates when designing the test, and told that it need not be small and light enough to be deployed by air.

Liquid deuterium was chosen as the fuel for the fusion reaction because its use simplified the experiment from a physicist&#x27;s point of view, and made the results easier to analyze. From an engineering point of view, its use necessitated the development of previously unknown technologies to handle the difficult material, which had to be stored at extremely low temperatures, near absolute zero. A large cryogenics plant was built to produce liquid hydrogen (used for cooling the device) and deuterium (fuel for the test). A power plant was also constructed for the cryogenics facility.

The device that was developed for testing the Teller-Ulam design became known as a &quot;Sausage&quot; design:

* At its center was a cylindrical insulated steel Dewar (vacuum flask) or cryostat. This tank, almost across and more than high, had walls almost thick. It weighed approximately . It was capable of holding of liquid deuterium, cooled to near-absolute zero. The cryogenic deuterium provided the fuel for the &quot;secondary&quot; (fusion) stage of the explosion.
* At one end of the cylindrical Dewar flask was a TX-5 regular fission bomb (not boosted). The TX-5 bomb was used to create the conditions needed to initiate the fusion reaction. This &quot;primary&quot; fission stage was nested inside the radiation case at the upper section of the device, and was not in physical contact with the &quot;secondary&quot; fusion stage. The TX-5 did not require refrigeration.
* Running down the center of the Dewar flask within the secondary was a cylindrical rod of plutonium within a chamber of tritium gas. This &quot;fission sparkplug&quot; was imploded by x-rays from the primary detonation. That provided a source of outward-moving pressure inside the deuterium and increased conditions for the fusion reaction.
* Surrounding the assembly was a natural uranium &quot;tamper&quot;. The exterior of the tamper was lined with sheets of lead and polyethylene, forming a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the &quot;primary&quot; to the &quot;secondary&quot; stage. As laid out in the Teller-Ulam design, the function of the X-rays was to compress the &quot;secondary&quot; with tamper/pusher ablation, foam plasma pressure and radiation pressure. This process increases the density and temperature of the deuterium to the level needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction, and compress the &quot;sparkplug&quot; to a supercritical mass – inducing the &quot;sparkplug&quot; to undergo nuclear fission and to thereby start a fusion reaction in the surrounding deuterium fuel.
The entire &quot;Mike&quot; device (including cryogenic equipment) weighed . It was housed in a large corrugated-aluminum building, called the shot cab, which was long,
 wide, and 
 high, with a 
 signal tower. Television and radio signals were used to communicate with a control room on where the firing party was located.

It was set up on the Pacific island of Elugelab, part of the Enewetak atoll. Elugelab was connected to the islands of Dridrilbwij (Teiteir), Bokaidrikdrik (Bogairikk), and Boken (Bogon) by a 
artificial causeway. Atop the causeway was an aluminum-sheathed plywood tube filled with helium ballonets, referred to as a Krause-Ogle box. 
This allowed gamma and neutron radiation to pass uninhibited to instruments in an unmanned detection station, Station 202, on Boken Island. From there signals were sent to recording equipment at Station 200, also housed in a bunker on Boken Island. Personnel returned to Boken Island after the test to recover the recording equipment.

In total, 9,350 military and 2,300 civilian personnel were involved in the &quot;Mike&quot; shot. The operation involved the cooperation of the United States army, navy, air force and intelligence services. The USS &quot;Curtiss&quot; brought components from the United States to Elugelab for assembly. Work was completed on October 31, at 5.00 p.m. Within an hour, personnel were evacuated in preparation for the blast.

==Detonation==


The test was carried out on 1 November 1952 at 07:15 local time (19:15 on 31 October, Greenwich Mean Time). It produced a yield of . of the final yield came from fast fission of the uranium tamper, which produced large amounts of radioactive fallout.

The fireball created by the explosion had a maximum radius of . The maximum radius was reached several seconds after the detonation, during which the hot fireball lifted up due to buoyancy. While still relatively close to the ground, the fireball had yet to reach its maximum dimensions and was thus approximately wide. The mushroom cloud rose to an altitude of in less than 90 seconds. One minute later it had reached , before stabilizing at with the top eventually spreading out to a diameter of with a stem wide.

The blast created a crater in diameter and deep where Elugelab had once been; the blast and water waves from the explosion (some waves up to high) stripped the test islands clean of vegetation, as observed by a helicopter survey within 60 minutes after the test, by which time the mushroom cloud and steam were blown away. Radioactive coral debris fell upon ships positioned away, and the immediate area around the atoll was heavily contaminated.

Close to the fireball, lightning discharges were rapidly triggered.
The entire shot was documented by the filmmakers of Lookout Mountain studios. A post-production explosion sound was overdubbed over what was a completely silent detonation from the vantage point of the camera, with the blast wave sound only arriving later, as akin to thunder, with the exact time depending on its distance. The film was also accompanied by powerful, Wagner-esque music featured on many test films of that period and was hosted by actor Reed Hadley. A private screening was given to President Dwight D. Eisenhower who had succeeded President Harry S. Truman in January 1953. In 1954, the film was released to the public after censoring, and was shown on commercial television channels.

Edward Teller, perhaps the most ardent supporter of the development of the hydrogen bomb, was in Berkeley, California, at the time of the shot. He was able to receive first notice that the test was successful by observing a seismometer, which picked up the shock wave that traveled through the earth from the Pacific Proving Grounds. In his memoirs, Teller wrote that he immediately sent an unclassified telegram to Dr. Elizabeth &quot;Diz&quot; Graves, the head of the rump project remaining at Los Alamos during the shot. The telegram contained only the words &quot;It&#x27;s a boy,&quot; which came hours earlier than any other word from Enewetak.

==Scientific discoveries==

An hour after the bomb was detonated, U.S. Air Force pilots took off from Enewetak Island to fly into the atomic cloud and take samples. Pilots had to monitor extra readouts and displays while &quot;piloting under unusual, dangerous, and difficult conditions” including heat, radiation, unpredictable winds and flying debris. &quot;Red Flight&quot; Leader Virgil K. Meroney flew into the stem of the explosion first. In five minutes, he had gathered all the samples he could, and exited. Next Bob Hagan and Jimmy Robinson entered the cloud. Robinson hit an area of severe turbulence, entering a spin and barely retaining consciousness. He regained control of his plane at 20,000 feet, but the electromagnetic storm had disrupted his instruments. In rain and poor visibility, without working instruments, Hagan and Robinson were unable to find the KB-29 tanker aircraft to refuel. They attempted to return to the field at Enewetak. Hagan, out of fuel, made a successful dead-stick landing on the runway. Robinson&#x27;s F-84 Thunderjet crashed and sank 3.5 miles short of the island. Robinson&#x27;s body was never recovered.

Fuel tanks on the airplane&#x27;s wings had been modified to scoop up and filter passing debris. The filters from the surviving planes were sealed in lead and sent to Los Alamos, New Mexico for analysis. Radioactive and contaminated with calcium carbonate, the &quot;Mike&quot; samples were extremely difficult to handle. Scientists at Los Alamos found traces in them of isotopes plutonium-246 and plutonium-244.

Al Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley speculated that the filters might also contain atoms that had transformed, through radioactive decay, into the predicted but undiscovered elements 99 and 100. Ghiorso, Stanley Gerald Thompson and Glenn Seaborg obtained half a filter paper from the Ivy Mike test. They were able to detect the existence of the elements einsteinium and fermium, which had been produced by intensely concentrated neutron flux about the detonation site. The discovery was kept secret for several years, but the team was eventually given credit. In 1955 the two new elements were named in honor of Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi.

==Related tests==
A simplified and lightened bomb version (the EC-16) was prepared and scheduled to be tested in operation Castle Yankee, as a backup in case the non-cryogenic &quot;Shrimp&quot; fusion device (tested in Castle Bravo) failed to work; that test was canceled when the Bravo device was tested successfully, making the cryogenic designs obsolete.

<text>The Pannerdens Kanaal (Pannerden Canal) is a canal in the Netherlands that was dredged between 1701 and 1709 to cut off a large, shallow bend of the river Rhine for improving river traffic and water regulation.

The canal, now indistinguishable from a &quot;real&quot; river, forks off north from the river Waal a few kilometres past the point where the Bijlands Kanaal, a similar canal dug to cut off a Waal bend, ends. It flows past the towns of Pannerden (right bank), which gives the canal its name, and Angeren (left bank) and so north to the point where the old Rhine bend flows into it and the river continues to the sea as the Nederrijn (Lower Rhine). The old Rhine bend, cut off at its upstream end, still exists and is called, unsurprisingly, Oude Rijn (Old Rhine).</text><links>

<doc id="947684" wikidata="Q7646141" url="?curid=947684" title="Surfman Badge">
<text>The Surfman Badge is a military badge of the United States Coast Guard, issued to enlisted or officer personnel who qualify as Coxswains authorized to operate surf boats in heavy surf. Those so qualified are referred to as surfmen, a term that was originally used by the United States Life-Saving Service, one of the predecessors to the Coast Guard.

Surf boats are boats that are designed to operate under extreme weather and sea conditions. Some of the surf boats that the Coast Guard operates include the 47-foot Motor Lifeboat (MLB), the (now decommissioned) 44-foot MLB, 42-foot Near Shore Lifeboat (SPC-NLB) and the 52-foot MLB (the only &quot;Boats&quot; in the Coast Guard to be given names, such as &quot;Victory&quot; at Station Yaquina Bay, Oregon, the oldest steel motor lifeboat in the US Coast Guard).

==Requirements==
To be awarded the Surfman Badge, a service member must undergo training in actual surf and breaking bar conditions, accumulate a minimum number of hours operating in these conditions, while conducting practical exercises and undergo a rigorous underway check ride as well as an oral review board. The process to qualify for a Surfman Badge requires at least eight years of training and experience. Coast Guard regulations do not permit the wearing of both Surfman and Coxswain insignia simultaneously.

The training includes a monthlong course at the National Motor Lifeboat School at Station Cape Disappointment (Ilwaco, Washington) to train prospective surfmen in handling the 47&#x27; MLB in rough weather.

==History==
Although the earliest ancestors to the United States Life-Saving Service started before the Civil War, it was not officially established as a branch of the United States Treasury Department until June 1878, under Sumner I. Kimball, who led the Treasury&#x27;s Revenue Marine Service. Kimball established the first training routines for surfmen, which included the Beach Apparatus Drill (firing rope lines via Lyle gun to establish a breeches buoy for rescues close to shore; the drill had to be completed within five minutes), boat handling (righting surfboats), first aid, signal flags, and nightly beach patrols.

===Motto===
The Surfmen&#x27;s motto was adopted around the beginning of the 20th Century: &quot;The book says that you&#x27;ve got to go out, but it doesn&#x27;t say a word about coming back.&quot; This is sometimes shortened as &quot;You have to go out, but you don&#x27;t have to come back&quot;, as popularized in the 2016 film &quot;The Finest Hours&quot;.

<text>Alivaltiosihteeri (&quot;Undersecretary of State&quot;) is a Finnish comedy group currently consisting of Simo Frangén, Pasi Heikura and Jyrki Liikka. It started as a band in 1985 but has since made both the weekly radio show Alivaltiosihteeri and a few TV shows. Books based on the radio shows have also been published.

== Band ==

The band Alivaltiosihteeri was formed in the mid-1980s in Tampere, Finland, consisting of four members: bassist Simo Frangén, lead guitarist Pasi Heikura, drummer Jyrki Liikka and singer Satu Kurvinen, who was later replaced by Matti Toivonen. The band was active from 1985 to the mid-1990s, but since then has concentrated on comic radio shows, books and even TV shows.

== Radio program ==

Since 1990 the first three members of the group have made weekly hour-long radio shows for the Finnish national broadcasting company Yleisradio (&quot;Alivaltiosihteeri - Suomen virallinen ohjelma&quot;, strictly translated &quot;Alivaltiosihteeri - the official program of Finland&quot;). The humour used in the shows is based on playing on words and the style is dry and official throughout, no matter what the subject is (deadpan). Every week two new palindromes are released, read both forwards and backwards. One of the songs played during program is always chosen from the albums by Neil Young (in the early 1990s AC/DC was used).</text><links>

<text>Number 120 Squadron or No. CXX Squadron is a squadron of the Royal Air Force which was established as a Royal Flying Corps unit late in World War I, disbanded a year after the end of the war, then re-established as a RAF Coastal Command squadron during World War II. Although disbanded again a month after Victory in Europe Day, during and after World War II it operated almost continuously, with maritime patrol aircraft; most recently with the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, based at RAF Kinloss in Scotland until the type&#x27;s withdrawal in March 2010. The squadron was disbanded again the following year. No. 120 Squadron stood up again in April 2018 at RAF Lossiemouth and became the first squadron to be equipped with the Boeing Poseidon MRA1 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft on 31 October 2019.

==History==

===Formation in First World War===
No. 120 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed at Cramlington on 1 January 1918, as a day bomber unit and was planned to be equipped with Airco DH.9. The First World War ended before it became operational, as the DH.9s were not delivered until October 1918, so No. 120 Squadron spent late 1918 and 1919 flying communication and mail flights in Western Europe until it was disbanded on 21 October 1919.

===Second World War===
The squadron reformed as part of Coastal Command in Northern Ireland on 2 June 1941 at RAF Nutts Corner, the unit was equipped with the Consolidated Liberator, flying against the U-boat threat in the war in the North Atlantic. The squadron received the first Mark I Liberators in June and began flying nine of them in September from RAF Aldergrove, Northern Ireland and RAF Reykjavik, Iceland. The number of Liberators in September 1942 had increased to six Mark I, two Mark II, and three Mark III. No. 120 Squadron remained the only Coastal Command squadron flying VLR (Very Long Range) Liberators in February 1943 with five Mark I and twelve Mark III.

No. 120 squadron was very successful in this role, sinking 14 U-boats outright; and was credited with a share in sinking three more, plus eight damaged. This was the highest kill total in Coastal Command, achieved while flying from Northern Ireland, Iceland, and in support of Operation Overlord – the Allied invasion of France in 1944.
*12 October 1942 – &quot;U-597&quot; sunk by depth charges from Liberator H piloted by Squadron Leader Terry Bulloch.
*15 October 1942 – (&quot;U-661&quot; credited to Liberator H but postwar analysis indicates an attack on &quot;U-615&quot; caused no damage)
*5 November 1942 – &quot;U-89&quot; damaged near convoy SC 107 (but initially believed to have sunk &quot;U-132&quot;)
*8 December 1942 – (&quot;U-254&quot; credited but postwar evidence indicates sank in collision with &quot;U-221&quot; near convoy HX 217)
*10 December 1942 – &quot;U-611&quot; sunk near convoy HX 217 by depth charges from Liberator B
*8 February 1943 – &quot;U-135&quot; damaged near convoy SC 118
*15 February 1943 – &quot;U-225&quot; sunk by Liberator S near convoy SC 119 (but initially believed to be &quot;U-529&quot;)
*21 February 1943 – &quot;U-623&quot; sunk near convoy ON 166 by Liberator T
*5 April 1943 – &quot;U-635&quot; sunk near convoy HX 231 by depth charges from Liberator N
*5 April 1943 – &quot;U-594&quot; damaged near convoy HX 231
*23 April 1943 – &quot;U-189&quot; sunk by Liberator V

After the war against Nazi Germany ended in May 1945, the squadron was disbanded on 4 June 1945 at RAF Ballykelly.

===Cold War to 2011===
The squadron was re-established on 1 October 1946, by renumbering No. 160 Squadron at RAF Leuchars, Fife. It was equipped with Avro Lancaster GR.3s, although some Liberators remained on strength until June 1947. A detachment of the squadron moved to Palestine in November 1947, where it carried out searches for illegal immigrant ships until February 1948, when it returned to Britain.
The squadron re-equipped with Avro Shackleton MR.1s in April 1951. No. CXX Squadron was awarded its Standard on 15 January 1952 by King George VI, despite not having accrued the required 25 years of service. It is one of two squadrons to have this honour – the other being No. 617 (Dambusters) Squadron. The squadron began operating from its new base RAF Kinloss, Moray, on 1 April 1959. It continued operating the MR.2 and MR.3 versions of the Shackleton in the maritime patrol role until February 1971. 

In October 1970, No. 120 Squadron began to re-equipped with Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.1. In 1973, the squadron flew sorties during the Second Cod War with Iceland. On 1 April 1979, a Nimrod MR.1 from No. CXX Squadron became the last British military aircraft to depart from RAF Luqa, Malta.

In April 1981, No. 120 Squadron started to receive the updated Nimrod MR.2. In 1982, the squadron was the first Nimrod MR.2 unit to arrive at Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island, from where it operated during the Falklands War. On 18 November 1983, a crew from the squadron made the first direct Falkland Islands to United Kingdom flight in 18 hours and 15 minutes. On 12 August 1990, the squadron deployed to Seeb International Airport, Oman, before participating in Operation Granby the following year. 

On 31 March 2010, the Nimrod MR.2 was withdrawn from service, and the squadron formally disbanded on 26 May 2011.

===Poseidon (2019–present)===

In July 2017, it was announced that No. 120 Squadron would be the first RAF squadron to fly the Boeing P-8A Poseidon, based at RAF Lossiemouth. No. CXX Squadron reformed on 1 April 2018. The first Poseidon MRA1 (&quot;ZP801&quot;) was delivered to the squadron at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, on 31 October 2019. &quot;ZP801&quot;, now named &quot;Pride of Moray&quot;, flew into Kinloss Barracks on 4 February 2020. &quot;ZP802&quot; was delivered to Kinloss on 13 March 2020. The RAF declared the Poseidon MRA1s combat ready on 1 April 2020. On 3 August 2020, No. 120 Squadron carried out their first operational mission with the P-8A, when &quot;ZP801&quot; shadowed the Russian warship &quot;Vasily Bykov&quot; in the North Sea. The two Poseidons at Kinloss moved to their permanent home of RAF Lossiemouth in October 2020, after works to accommodate the P-8As were completed. &quot;ZP803&quot; was the first to be delivered to RAF Lossiemouth, arriving on 14 October 2020. Poseidon MRA1 &quot;ZP804&quot; was delivered on 3 November 2020. On 2 February 2021, &quot;ZP805&quot; was delivered to RAF Lossiemouth having flown direct from Boeing Field, Washington, in just over eight hours. By November 2021, eight of nine aircraft had been delivered to RAF Lossiemouth and the final aircraft arrived in January 2022.

<doc id="947689" wikidata="Q17111727" url="?curid=947689" title="List of British Regular Army regiments (1962)">
<text>This is a list of British Regular Army regiments after the Army restructuring caused by the 1957 Defence White Paper. The paper set out the reduction in size of the Army to 165,000 following the end of National Service and the change to an entirely voluntary army; units were to be disbanded or amalgamated over two phases, to be completed in 1959 and 1962.

Further cuts and amalgamations followed in the 1960s and early 1970s.

<text>Dredging is the excavation of material from a water environment. Possible reasons for dredging include improving existing water features; reshaping land and water features to alter drainage, navigability, and commercial use; constructing dams, dikes, and other controls for streams and shorelines; and recovering valuable mineral deposits or marine life having commercial value. In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant, known as a dredger.

Usually the main objectives of dredging is to recover material of value, or to create a greater depth of water. Dredging systems can either be shore-based, brought to a location based on barges, or built into purpose-built vessels.

Dredging can have environmental impacts: it can disturb marine sediments, creating dredge plumes which can lead to both short- and long-term water pollution, damage or destroy seabed ecosystems, and release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment. These environmental impacts can reduce marine wildlife populations, contaminate sources of drinking water, and interrupt economic activities such as fishing.

==Description==

Dredging is excavation carried out underwater or partially underwater, in shallow waters or ocean waters. It keeps waterways and ports navigable, and assists coastal protection, land reclamation and coastal redevelopment, by gathering up bottom sediments and transporting it elsewhere. Dredging can be done to recover materials of commercial value; these may be high value minerals or sediments such as sand and gravel that are used by the construction industry.

Dredging is a four-part process: loosening the material, bringing the material to the surface (together extraction), transportation and disposal.

The extract can be disposed of locally or transported by barge or in a liquid suspension in pipelines. Disposal can be to infill sites, or the material can be used constructively to replenish eroded sand that has been lost to coastal erosion, or constructively create sea-walls, building land or whole new landforms such as viable islands in coral atolls.

==History==
Ancient authors refer to harbour dredging. The seven arms of the Nile were channelled and wharfs built at the time of the pyramids (4000 BC), there was extensive harbour building in the eastern Mediterranean from 1000 BC and the disturbed sediment layers gives evidence of dredging. At Marseille, dredging phases are recorded from the third century BC onwards, the most extensive during the first century AD. The remains of three dredging boats have been unearthed; they were abandoned at the bottom of the harbour during the first and second centuries AD.

The Banu Musa brothersduring the Muslim Golden Age in while working at the Bayt-Al-Hikmah (house of wisdom) in Baghdad, designed an original invention in their book named &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;, a grab machine that does not appear in any earlier Greek works. The grab they described was used to extract objects from underwater, and recover objects from the beds of streams.

During the renaissance Leonardo da Vinci drew a design for a drag dredger.

Dredging machines have been used during the construction of the Suez Canal from the late 1800s to present day expansions and maintenance. The completion of the Panama Canal in 1914, the most expensive U.S. engineering project at the time, relied extensively on dredging.


==Purposes==
*Capital dredging: dredging carried out to create a new harbour, berth or waterway, or to deepen existing facilities in order to allow larger ships access. Because capital works usually involve hard material or high-volume works, the work is usually done using a cutter suction dredge or large trailing suction hopper dredge; but for rock works, drilling and blasting along with mechanical excavation may be used.
*Land reclamation: dredging to mine sand, clay or rock from the seabed and using it to construct new land elsewhere. This is typically performed by a cutter-suction dredge or trailing suction hopper dredge. The material may also be used for flood or erosion control.
*Maintenance: dredging to deepen or maintain navigable waterways or channels which are threatened to become silted with the passage of time, due to sedimented sand and mud, possibly making them too shallow for navigation. This is often carried out with a trailing suction hopper dredge. Most dredging is for this purpose, and it may also be done to maintain the holding capacity of reservoirs or lakes.
*Harvesting materials: dredging sediment for elements like gold, diamonds or other valuable trace substances. Hobbyists examine their dredged matter to pick out items of potential value, similar to the hobby of metal detecting.
*Fishing dredging is a technique for catching certain species of edible clams and crabs. In Louisiana and other American states, with salt water estuaries that can sustain bottom oyster beds, oysters are raised and harvested. A heavy rectangular metal scoop is towed astern of a moving boat with a chain bridle attached to a cable. This drags along the bottom scooping up oysters. It is periodically winched aboard and the catch is sorted and bagged for shipment.
* Preparatory: dredging work and excavation for future bridges, piers or docks or wharves, This is often to build the foundations.
* Winning construction materials: dredging sand and gravels from offshore licensed areas for use in construction industry, principally for use in concrete. This very specialist industry is focused in NW Europe, it uses specialized trailing suction hopper dredgers self discharging the dry cargo ashore. Land based old river beddings can be processed in this manner too.
* Contaminant remediation: to reclaim areas affected by chemical spills, storm water surges (with urban runoff), and other soil contaminations, including silt from sewage sludge and from decayed matter, like wilted plants. Disposal becomes a proportionally large factor in these operations.
* Flood prevention: dredging increases the channel depth and therefore increase a channel&#x27;s capacity for carrying water.

===Other===

* Beach nourishment: this is mining sand offshore and placing on a beach to replace sand eroded by storms or wave action. This enhances the recreational and protective function of the beach, which are also eroded by human activity. This is typically performed by a cutter-suction dredge or trailing suction hopper dredge. 
* Peat extraction: &quot;dredging poles&quot; or &quot;dredge hauls&quot; were used on the back of small boats to manually dredge the beds of peat-moor waterways. The extracted peat was used as a fuel. This tradition is now more or less obsolete. The tools are now significantly changed.
* Removing rubbish and debris: often done in combination with maintenance dredging, this process removes non-natural matter from the bottoms of rivers and canals and harbours. Law enforcement agencies sometimes need to use a &#x27;drag&#x27; to recover evidence or corpses from beneath the water.
* Anti-eutrophication: A kind of contaminant remediation, dredging is an expensive option for the remediation of eutrophied (or de-oxygenated) water bodies; one of the causes is like mentioned above, sewage sludge. However, as artificially elevated phosphorus levels in the sediment aggravate the eutrophication process, controlled sediment removal is occasionally the only option for the reclamation of still waters.
* Seabed mining: is a possible future use, recovering natural metal ore nodules from the sea&#x27;s deepest troughs.

==Types==
===Suction dredgers===


These operate by sucking through a long tube like some vacuum cleaners but on a larger scale.

A plain suction dredger has no tool at the end of the suction pipe to disturb the material.

====Trailing suction====
A trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD) trails its suction pipe when working. The pipe, which is fitted with a dredge drag head, loads the dredge spoil into one or more hoppers in the vessel.
When the hoppers are full, the TSHD sails to a disposal area and either dumps the material through doors in the hull or pumps the material out of the hoppers. Some dredges also self-offload using drag buckets and conveyors.

 the largest trailing suction hopper dredgers in the world were Jan De Nul&#x27;s &quot;Cristobal Colon&quot; (launched 4 July 2008) and her sister ship &quot;Leiv Eriksson&quot; (launched 4 September 2009). Main design specifications for the &quot;Cristobal Colon&quot; and the &quot; Leiv Eriksson&quot; are: 46,000 cubic metre hopper and a design dredging depth of 155 m. Next largest is &quot;HAM 318&quot; (Van Oord) with its 37,293 cubic metre hopper and a maximum dredging depth of 101 m.

====Cutter-suction====
A cutter-suction dredger&#x27;s (CSD) suction tube has a cutting mechanism at the suction inlet. The cutting mechanism loosens the bed material and transports it to the suction mouth. The dredged material is usually sucked up by a wear-resistant centrifugal pump and discharged either through a pipe line or to a barge. Cutter-suction dredgers are most often used in geological areas consisting of hard surface materials (for example gravel deposits or surface bedrock) where a standard suction dredger would be ineffective. They can, if sufficiently powerful, be used instead of underwater blasting.

, the most powerful cutter-suction dredger in the world is DEME&#x27;s &quot;Spartacus&quot;, which entered service in 2021.

====Auger suction====
The auger dredge system functions like a cutter suction dredger, but the cutting tool is a rotating Archimedean screw set at right angles to the suction pipe. Mud Cat invented the auger dredge in the 1970s.

====Jet-lift====
These use the Venturi effect of a concentrated high-speed stream of water to pull the nearby water, together with bed material, into a pipe.

====Air-lift====
An airlift is a type of small suction dredge. It is sometimes used like other dredges. At other times, an airlift is handheld underwater by a diver. It works by blowing air into the pipe, and that air, being lighter than water, rises inside the pipe, dragging water with it.

===Mechanical dredgers ===

Some bucket dredgers and grab dredgers are powerful enough to rip out coral to make a shipping channel through coral reefs.
====Bucket dredgers====
A bucket dredger is equipped with a bucket dredge, which is a device that picks up sediment by mechanical means, often with many circulating buckets attached to a wheel or chain.

====Grab dredgers====

A grab dredger picks up seabed material with a clam shell bucket, which hangs from an onboard crane or a crane barge, or is carried by a hydraulic arm, or is mounted like on a dragline. This technique is often used in excavation of bay mud. Most of these dredges are crane barges with spuds, steel piles that can be lowered and raised to position the dredge.

====Backhoe/dipper dredgers====
A backhoe/dipper dredger has a backhoe like on some excavators. A crude but usable backhoe dredger can be made by mounting a land-type backhoe excavator on a pontoon. The six largest backhoe dredgers in the world are currently the Vitruvius, the Mimar Sinan, Postnik Yakovlev (Jan De Nul), the Samson (DEME), the Simson and the Goliath (Van Oord). They featured barge-mounted excavators. Small backhoe dredgers can be track-mounted and work from the bank of ditches. A backhoe dredger is equipped with a half-open shell. The shell is filled moving towards the machine. Usually dredged material is loaded in barges. This machine is mainly used in harbours and other shallow water.

Excavator dredge attachments

The excavator dredge attachment uses the characteristics of cutter-suction dredgers, consisting of cutter heads and a suction pump for transferring material. These hydraulic attachments mount onto the boom arm of an excavator allowing an operator to maneuver the attachment along the shoreline and in shallow water for dredging.

====Bed leveler====
 This is a bar or blade which is pulled over the seabed behind any suitable ship or boat. It has an effect similar to that of a bulldozer on land. The chain-operated steam dredger &quot;Bertha&quot;, built in 1844 to a design by Brunel and was the oldest operational steam vessel in Britain, was of this type.

====Krabbelaar====
This is an early type of dredger which was formerly used in shallow water in the Netherlands. It was a flat-bottomed boat with spikes sticking out of its bottom. As tide current pulled the boat, the spikes scraped seabed material loose, and the tide current washed the material away, hopefully to deeper water. &quot;Krabbelaar&quot; is the Dutch word for &quot;scratcher&quot;.

====Water injection==== 

A water injection dredger uses a small jet to inject water under low pressure (to prevent the sediment from exploding into the surrounding waters) into the seabed to bring the sediment in suspension, which then becomes a turbidity current, which flows away down slope, is moved by a second burst of water from the WID or is carried away in natural currents. Water injection results in a lot of sediment in the water which makes measurement with most hydrographic equipment (for instance: singlebeam echosounders) difficult.
====Pneumatic====
These dredgers use a chamber with inlets, out of which the water is pumped with the inlets closed. It is usually suspended from a crane on land or from a small pontoon or barge. Its effectiveness depends on depth pressure.

====Snagboat====
A snagboat is designed to remove big debris such as dead trees and parts of trees from North America waterways.

====Amphibious====
Some of these are any of the above types of dredger, which can operate normally, or by extending legs, also known as spuds, so it stands on the seabed with its hull out of the water. Some forms can go on land.

Some of these are land-type backhoe excavators whose wheels are on long hinged legs so it can drive into shallow water and keep its cab out of water. Some of these may not have a floatable hull and, if so, cannot work in deep water. Oliver Evans (1755–1819) in 1804 invented the Oruktor Amphibolos, an amphibious dredger which was America&#x27;s first steam-powered road vehicle.

====Submersible====
These are usually used to recover useful materials from the seabed. Many of them travel on continuous track. A unique variant is intended to walk on legs on the seabed.

====Fishing====
Fishing dredges are used to collect various species of clams, scallops, oysters or mussels from the seabed. Some dredges are also designed to catch crabs, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and conch. These dredges have the form of a scoop made of chain mesh, and are towed by a fishing boat. Clam-specific dredges can utilize hydraulic injection to target deeper into the sand. Dredging can be destructive to the seabed and some scallop dredging has been replaced by collecting via scuba diving.

===Notable individual dredgers===
As of June 2018, the largest dredger in Asia is , a long dredger constructed in China, with a capacity of . An even larger dredger, retired in 1980, was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which was long. The , a clamshell dredger that maintains levees in San Francisco Bay, has operated continuously since being built in 1936.

===Dredge monitoring software===
Dredgers are often equipped with dredge monitoring software to help the dredge operator position the dredger and monitor the current dredge level. The monitoring software often uses Real Time Kinematic satellite navigation to accurately record where the machine has been operating and to what depth the machine has dredged to.

==Transportation and disposal of materials==

In a &quot;hopper dredger&quot;, the dredged materials end up in a large onboard hold called a &quot;hopper.&quot; A suction hopper dredger is usually used for maintenance dredging. A hopper dredge usually has doors in its bottom to empty the dredged materials, but some dredges empty their hoppers by splitting the two-halves of their hulls on large hydraulic hinges. Either way, as the vessel dredges, excess water in the dredged materials is spilled off as the heavier solids settle to the bottom of the hopper. This excess water is returned to the sea to reduce weight and increase the amount of solid material (or slurry) that can be carried in one load. When the hopper is filled with slurry, the dredger stops dredging and goes to a dump site and empties its hopper.

Some hopper dredges are designed so they can also be emptied from above using pumps if dump sites are unavailable or if the dredge material is contaminated. Sometimes the slurry of dredgings and water is pumped straight into pipes which deposit it on nearby land. These pipes are also commonly known as dredge hoses, too. There are a few different types of dredge hoses that differ in terms of working pressure, float-ability, armored or not etc. Suction hoses, discharge armored hoses and self-floating hoses are some of the popular types engineered for transporting and discharging dredge materials. Some even had the pipes or hoses customised to exact dredging needs etc. Other times, it is pumped into barges (also called scows), which deposit it elsewhere while the dredge continues its work.

A number of vessels, notably in the UK and NW Europe de-water the hopper to dry the cargo to enable it to be discharged onto a quayside &#x27;dry&#x27;. This is achieved principally using self discharge bucket wheel, drag scraper or excavator via conveyor systems.

When contaminated (toxic) sediments are to be removed, or large volume inland disposal sites are unavailable, dredge slurries are reduced to dry solids via a process known as dewatering, to minimize the dredge plume. Current dewatering techniques employ either centrifuges, geotube containers, large textile based filters or polymer flocculant/congealant based apparatus.

In many projects, slurry dewatering is performed in large inland settling pits, although this is becoming less and less common as mechanical dewatering techniques continue to improve.

Similarly, many groups (most notable in east Asia) are performing research towards utilizing dewatered sediments for the production of concretes and construction block, although the high organic content (in many cases) of this material is a hindrance toward such ends.

The proper management of contaminated sediments is a modern-day issue of significant concern. Because of a variety of maintenance activities, thousands of tonnes of contaminated sediment are dredged worldwide from commercial ports and other aquatic areas at high level of industrialization. Dredged material can be reused after appropriate decontamination. A variety of processes has been proposed and tested at different scales of application (technologies for environmental remediation). Once decontaminated, the material could well suit the building industry, or could be used for beach nourishment.

==Environmental impacts==

Dredging can disturb aquatic ecosystems, often with adverse impacts. In addition, dredge spoils may contain toxic chemicals that may have an adverse effect on the disposal area; furthermore, the process of dredging often dislodges chemicals residing in benthic substrates and injects them into the water column, where they become toxic dredge plumes.

Dredging can have numerous significant impacts on the environment, including the following:
* Release of toxic chemicals (including heavy metals and PCB) from bottom sediments into the water column.
* Short term increases in turbidity, which can affect aquatic species metabolism and interfere with spawning. Suction dredging activity is allowed only during non-spawning time frames set by fish and game (in-water work periods).
* Secondary impacts to marsh productivity from sedimentation and general changes in wetland chemistry after dredging.
* Tertiary impacts to avifauna which may prey upon contaminated aquatic organisms.
* Secondary impacts to aquatic and benthic organisms&#x27; metabolism and mortality.
* Possible contamination of dredge spoils sites.
* Changes to the topography by creating &quot;spoil islands&quot; from the accumulated spoil.
* Releases toxic compound Tributyltin, a biocide often used in anti-fouling paint banned in 2008, into the water.

The nature of dredging operations and possible environmental impacts requires that the activity often be closely regulated and requires comprehensive regional environmental impact assessments alongside continuous monitoring. For example, in the U.S., the Clean Water Act requires that any discharge of dredged or fill materials into &quot;waters of the United States,&quot; including wetlands, is forbidden unless authorized by a permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
Due to potential environmental impacts, dredging is often restricted to licensed areas, with vessel activity monitored closely using automatic GPS systems.
Town Of Oyster Bay v. Commander Oil Corporation, Court of Appeals of New York (2001) , showed a case in which the dredger had received a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers preventing the nearby city (Town Of Oyster Bay) to stop the dredging.

<doc id="947697" wikidata="Q2755135" url="?curid=947697" title="Cagalli Yula Athha">
<text>is a fictional character introduced in the Japanese science fiction anime television series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; by Sunrise, part of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. In the series, Cagalli is one of the regular humans, labeled as Naturals, fighting against genetically enhanced humans known as Coordinators in a prolonged war. Despite being seen fighting on the battlefield at various times alongside the Naturals military organization the Earth Alliance, Cagalli is later revealed to be the daughter of Uzumi Nara Athha, the leader of the neutral country of Orb. After assisting her new allies to stop the war, Cagalli becomes the leader of Orb. Her new role as such is further explored in the series sequel, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;. Cagalli is voiced by Naomi Shindō and Nanako Mori in Japanese. In English, she is voiced by Vanessa Morley in the Ocean dub and by Cherami Leigh in the NYAV dub.

Cagalli has also reprised her role from the TV series, in the films recollections from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; as well as its manga adaptations. Her character has also been well received in Japan, having appeared various times in the Anime Grand Prix polls for the favorite female anime character category, as well as online polls by Sunrise regarding the Gundam franchise. Critical reception for Cagalli has also been positive, mostly because of her strong personality and development across both TV series.

==Appearances==

===In the television series===
Cagalli is first seen in the Heliopolis space colony where she discovers that advanced mobile suits have been developed for the Earth Alliance by Orb. During ZAFT&#x27;s attack on Heliopolis, Cagalli runs into Kira Yamato who leads her to an evacuation shelter. She reappears when ZAFT&#x27;s Andrew Waltfeld destroys the town of Tassil, forcing her and her comrades from the Desert Dawn to chase after him. Outmatched, several resistance fighters are killed until Kira arrives in the Strike to save them. Cagalli stays with the Archangel ship assisting it in battle with a spare FX-550 Skygrasper while befriending Kira. When the Archangel reaches Orb, Cagalli reveals that she is the daughter of the Orb Union&#x27;s Chief Representative Uzumi Nara Athha. Cagalli stays with Orb and later learns that captured ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala has apparently killed Kira. She confronts Athrun but allows him to return to ZAFT. Cagalli later learns of Kira&#x27;s survival and reunites with him as well as Athrun who has joined forces with Kira.

When the Earth Alliance under the direction of Blue Cosmos attacks Orb, Cagalli&#x27;s father gives her a photograph of her and Kira when they were babies revealing that they are twins. Cagalli then escapes on board the Kusanagi as her father and the other Orb leaders sacrifice their lives by self-destructing the Kaguya mass driver in order to prevent it from being used by the Earth Alliance. Cagalli then joins the Three Ships Alliance, which is trying to stop the genocidal intentions of the leaders of both sides. There, she starts a romantic relationship with Athrun and becomes the pilot of the mobile suit to protect him.

By &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, set two years after &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, Cagalli has taken her father&#x27;s former position as Chief Representative of the Orb Union. She is accompanied by Athrun, who acts as her aide and bodyguard, on a diplomatic mission to the PLANT&#x27;s where she meets with Chairman Gilbert Durandal to discuss matters regarding increased militarization. Within Orb, Cagalli is manipulated by others to endorse an alliance between the Earth Alliance and Orb and to go through with an arranged marriage with Yuna Roma Seiran to finalize the agreement. Kira kidnaps Cagalli during her wedding and takes her to the Archangel. Cagalli realizes her mistake and from the Archangel attempts to reason with Orb&#x27;s military forces in an effort to stop them from fighting against ZAFT. However, Yuna refuses to acknowledge Cagalli and orders Orb&#x27;s forces to open fire on her. Having returned to ZAFT, Athrun blames the Archangel for making the situation worse, much to Cagalli&#x27;s shock. When the Archangel returns to Orb, it is under attack by ZAFT and Earth Alliance forces seeking the sheltered Lord Djibril, leader of Logos. There Cagalli receives the mobile suit as Uzumi&#x27;s will. Piloting the Akatsuki, Cagalli resumes her position as Orb&#x27;s leader and orders the arrest of Yuna. She then leads a counter-attack against ZAFT. She is able to keep Shinn Asuka at bay long enough for Kira&#x27;s return. Afterwards, Cagalli remains in Orb to tend to her responsibilities as Orb&#x27;s leader, while the Archangel returns to space to continue the fight against ZAFT.

===In other media===
Besides starring in the TV series, Cagalli is also featured in two series of films &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Special Edition&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition&quot; which retell the events from its respective series. In the latter film&#x27;s ending as well as the original video animation, Cagalli makes a peace agreement with ZAFT, remaining in Orb. She is also featured in the manga adaptations of both &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, the latter also including &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge&quot;. In the manga &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73 Δ Astray&quot; Cagalli meets a team from Mars during their visit to Orb but disappears when she is kidnapped by Kira during the events of &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;.

She is also featured in several video games from the series including &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T.&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. II&quot; where she is playable piloting the Strike Rouge and the Akatsuki. She has also been featured in a character CDs from the series with tracks performed by her Japanese voice actress, Naomi Shindō.

==Reception==
Cagalli&#x27;s character has been very popular in Japan; she has appeared various on the popularity polls in Anime Grand Prix as one of the best female anime characters. In 2002, she came in second, and later went fourth in 2003. She was second in both the 27th and 28th, and remained fourth in the 29th. In a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll, Cagalli was voted as the most popular female anime character from the 2000s. Cagalli was also the winner in a Sunrise poll that asked fans what female character from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; would they want to see in swimsuit. She was also first in another that asked what female characters from the Gundam franchise would they want to see in a wedding dress. Two other polls from the same site asked fans what was the most memorable characters from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and from &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;; Cagalli was fourth in both of them.

Publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Cagalli&#x27;s character, giving generally positive response. In a review by Mania Entertainment writer Kim Wolstenholme, Cagalli was described with praise as a strong female character rather than a &quot;wishy-washy character&quot; seen in other anime series. He also liked her involvement in &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; following her short appearance in the series&#x27; first episode. A similar comment was made by Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network who praised Cagalli&#x27;s return in the series due to the fact the importance from her role was found &quot;unexpected&quot;. Moreover, Liversidge favorited the episodes in which Cagalli and Athrun meet and fight for the first time, as it also developed their characters as the two talked. Writing for Mania, Chris Beveridge also liked Cagalli&#x27;s involvement in the series citing her experience in combat as well as a romantic triangle that appeared to be between her, Kira and Flay Allster. In a later episode, Wolstenholme found that Cagalli&#x27;s character had become more mature when she confronts Athrun about the reasons to kill somebody following her father&#x27;s teachings, citing it as a strong quiet moments from the series. Reviewing the manga of &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; Julie Gray from Comic Book Bin praised Cagalli&#x27;s romantical relationship with Athrun featured in the volume, emphasizing how integral is it to the story and pointing as the romantical theme brought by the series. Vanessa Morley&#x27;s work as Cagalli&#x27;s English voice actress was found to be &quot;satisfyingly tomboyish&quot; by Anime News Network writer Theron Martin despite noting that her Japanese voice actress, Naomi Shindō, portrayed more manly.

According to the website &quot;&quot; the couple Cagalli and Athrun is highly popular and the film &quot;Gundam Seed Freedom&quot; alongside its novelization cheered up the fans thanks to its focus on them and this can be explored further as parallel to Kira and Lacus.

<text>Jennette B. Bradley (born October 2, 1952) is an American politician of the Republican party and served as the 62nd lieutenant governor of Ohio from 2003 to 2005 and Ohio State Treasurer from 2005 to 2007. Bradley was the first African American woman elected to statewide office in Ohio.

==Early life and education==
Bradley was born in Columbus, Ohio. Her family settled in a neighborhood on Columbus&#x27; east side after her father retired from the United States Army. After graduating from East High School in 1970, Bradley attended Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio and earned a degree in psychology.

==Early professional career==
Bradley took a job with the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority. She became the first black woman to serve as the executive director of the Authority when she was 28 years old. In 1986, Bradley moved to Washington, D.C. She returned to Columbus in 1989 and worked as a senior executive for Huntington National Bank.

==Columbus City Council==
Bradley entered the 1991 Columbus City Council race as a Republican candidate. She was reelected in 1995 and 1999. During her tenure she was chair of City Council&#x27;s Recreation and Parks and Public Utilities committees. She resigned from the council when she became Lieutenant Governor in 2003.

==Lieutenant governor==
In 2002 Governor Bob Taft announced he had chosen Bradley to replace Maureen O&#x27;Connor as his running mate. Many conservatives did not support Bradley because she was pro-choice. Critics of the Taft-Bradley ticket were also concerned about her City Council vote to extend city workers&#x27; health care benefits to include domestic partners and same-sex couples. Bradley was then criticized for having later voted against this legislation.

Taft and Bradley won the race with approximately 58% of the vote. Bradley became the third female lieutenant governor of Ohio and the first African-American woman elected to the office. She also became the first black female lieutenant governor of any U.S. state.

After taking office, Bradley was appointed by Taft to head the Ohio Department of Commerce, the Clean Ohio Council, and the Ohio Housing Finance Agency. In 2004, the governor also appointed Bradley to the &quot;Jobs Cabinet.&quot; Following the resignation of Joseph T. Deters as state treasurer, Taft appointed Bradley to the post, effective January 2005. She resigned as lieutenant governor before taking her new post However, Bradley was defeated by conservative Tea Party-backed Ashtabula County Auditor Sandra O&#x27;Brien in the May 2006 Republican primary election.

== Further career ==
In 2016, Bradley was among the 9 people chosen from over 100 candidates to serve on a committee to review the charter of the Columbus City Council.

<text>Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was the name of several gay liberation groups, the first of which was formed in New York City in 1969, immediately after the Stonewall riots. Similar organizations also formed in the UK, Australia and Canada. The GLF provided a voice for the newly-out and newly radicalized gay community, and a meeting place for a number of activists who would go on to form other groups, such as the Gay Activists Alliance, Gay Youth New York, and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) in the US. In the UK and Canada, activists also developed a platform for gay liberation and demonstrated for gay rights. Activists from both the US and UK groups would later go on to found or be active in groups including ACT UP, the Lesbian Avengers, Queer Nation, Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and Stonewall.

== United States ==

=== New York City ===

The United States Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was formed in the aftermath of the Stonewall Riots. The riots are considered by many to be the prime catalyst for the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQ rights in the United States.

On June 28, 1969, in Greenwich Village, New York, the New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, a well known gay bar, located on Christopher Street. Police raids of the Stonewall, and other lesbian and gay bars, were a routine practice at the time, with regular payoffs to dirty cops and organized crime figures an expected part of staying in business. The Stonewall Inn was made up of two former horse stables which had been renovated into one building in 1930. Like all gay bars of the era, it was subject to countless police raids, as LGBTQ activities and fraternization were still largely illegal. But this time, when the police began arresting patrons, the customers began pelting them with coins, and later, bottles and rocks. The lesbian and gay crowd also freed staff members who had been put into police vans, and the outnumbered officers retreated inside the bar. Soon, the Tactical Patrol Force (TPF), originally trained to deal with war protests, were called in to control the mob, which was now using a parking meter as a battering ram. As the patrol force advanced, the crowd did not disperse, but instead doubled back and re-formed behind the riot police, throwing rocks, shouting &quot;Gay Power!&quot;, dancing, and taunting their opposition. For the next several nights, the crowd would return in ever increasing numbers, handing out leaflets and rallying themselves. Soon the word &quot;Stonewall&quot; came to represent fighting for equality in the gay community. And in commemoration, Gay Pride marches are held every year on the anniversary of the riots.

In early July 1969, due in large part to the Stonewall riots in June of that year, discussions in the gay community led to the formation of the Gay Liberation Front. According to scholar Henry Abelove, it was named GLF &quot;in a provocative allusion to the Algerian National Liberation Front and the Vietnamese National Liberation Front.&quot; On July 31, 1969 the core group of radical activists met again at Alternate U, a leftist meeting hall and lecture center on 6th Ave. at 14th Street. The meeting was attended by over 40 people including Martha Shelley, Marty Robinson, Bill Katzenberg, Lois Hart, Suzanne BeVier, Ron Ballard, Bob Kohler, Marty Stefan, Mark Giles, Charles Pitts, Pete Wilson, Michael Brown, John O’Brien, Earl Galvin, Dan Smith, Jim Fouratt, Billy Weaver, Jerry Hoose, Leo Martello and others. Space usage at Alternate U was arranged with AU staffer, Susan Silverman, who also attended the meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;glf-foundation.org/timeline&quot;&gt;glf-foundation.org/timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the decision was made to break away from existing gay and lesbian organizations and form the new group to be called the Gay Liberation Front, the name that Martha Shelley “officially” introduced at the meeting. All three words had powerful meanings. “Gay” implied the new radical, out-of-the-closet generation—no longer a quasi-apologetic “homophile group.” “Liberation” implied its broad and radical agenda, a word used at that time by the Women’s, Vietnamese, Black and other freedom movements. “Front” denoted an umbrella coalition uniting a diverse group of lesbian and gay people despite their differences in class, age, gender, race and ethnicity. The meeting then authorized Lois Hart, Michael Brown and Ron Ballard to compose a statement of purpose that appeared in the next issue of “Rat,” a prominent New York radical movement newspaper at that time. From the beginning, GLF stated its goals as confronting all forms of sexism and male supremacy which it held to be the source of LGBT oppression and to form coalitions with other radical groups working to create a world-wide social revolution.

On August 2, 1969, the group held a protest at the Women&#x27;s House of Detention in Greenwich Village and would go on to hold weekly protests there.

One of GLF&#x27;s early acts included organizing a march protesting coverage of gay people by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which took place on September 12, 1969. Long before the word &quot;intersectionality&quot; came into use, the GLF had a broad political platform, denouncing racism and declaring support for various Third World struggles and the Black Panther Party. They took an anti-capitalist stance and attacked the nuclear family and traditional gender roles. Continuing its protest on how the media portrayed LGBT people and the movement, GLF picketed the offices of Time Magazine following their publication of a cover story entitled “The Homosexual in America.”

&quot;Come Out!&quot;, the first periodical published by the GLF, came out it November 1969.

In 1970, several GLF women, such as Martha Shelley, Lois Hart, Karla Jay, and Michela Griffo went on to form the Radicalesbians, a lesbian activist organization. Their first protest was at the National Organization of Women’s Second Congress to Unite Women. The group protested NOW&#x27;s exclusion of lesbians and lack of support for lesbian issues.

In 1970, members of GLF New York led by Mark Segal and Nova, formed the group Gay Youth New York, for people under 21 years of age.

In 1970, the drag queen caucus of the GLF, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, formed the group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), during a GLF action, the occupation of Weinstein Hall in a protest against NYU policies. STAR focused on providing support for gay prisoners, housing for homeless gay youth and street people, especially other young &quot;street queens&quot;.

In 1970, several Black and Latinx members of the GLF, including graphic artist Juan Carlos Vidal and poet Néstor Latrónico, formed Third World Gay Revolution (T.W.G.R.), which attempted to vocalize and combat the triple oppression of heterosexism, racism, and classism experienced by queer people of color. Another chapter of T.W.G.R. opened in Chicago shortly after the original group formed in New York.

In 1970, the GLF, led by Gary Alinder, protested the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder.

In 2019, in recognition of GLF New York&#x27;s historic role in the post-Stonewall LGBTQ movement, and its central role in establishing the annual Pride March, NYC Pride announced that GLF would be one of the Grand Marshal&#x27;s for the march commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising.

=== San Francisco ===
On October 31, 1969, sixty members of the GLF, the Committee for Homosexual Freedom (CHF), and the Gay Guerilla Theatre group staged a protest outside the offices of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; in response to a series of news articles disparaging people in San Francisco&#x27;s gay bars and clubs. The peaceful protest against the &quot;Examiner&quot; turned tumultuous and was later called &quot;Friday of the Purple Hand&quot; and &quot;Bloody Friday of the Purple Hand&quot;. Examiner employees &quot;dumped a barrel of printers&#x27; ink on the crowd from the roof of the newspaper building&quot;, according to glbtq.com. Some reports state that it was a barrel of ink poured from the roof of the building. The protesters &quot;used the ink to scrawl slogans on the building walls&quot; and slap purple hand prints &quot;throughout downtown [San Francisco]&quot; resulting in &quot;one of the most visible demonstrations of gay power&quot; according to the &quot;Bay Area Reporter&quot;. According to Larry LittleJohn, then president of Society for Individual Rights, &quot;At that point, the tactical squad arrived – not to get the employees who dumped the ink, but to arrest the demonstrators. Somebody could have been hurt if that ink had gotten into their eyes, but the police were knocking people to the ground.&quot; The accounts of police brutality include women being thrown to the ground and protesters&#x27; teeth being knocked out. Inspired by Black Hand extortion methods of Camorra gangsters and the Mafia, some gay and lesbian activists attempted to institute &quot;purple hand&quot; as a warning to stop anti-gay attacks, but with little success. In Turkey, the LGBT rights organization MorEl Eskişehir LGBTT Oluşumu (Purple Hand Eskişehir LGBT Formation), also bears the name of this symbol.

In 1970 &quot;The U.S. Mission&quot; had a permit to use a campground in the Sequoia National Forest. Once it was learned that the group was sponsored by the GLF, the Sequoia National Forest supervisor cancelled the permit, and the campground was closed for the period.

==United Kingdom==

The UK Gay Liberation Front existed between 1970 and 1973.

Its first meeting was held in the basement of the London School of Economics on 13 October 1970. Bob Mellors and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics. &quot;Come Together&quot;, the organisation&#x27;s newspaper, came out of its Media Workshop the same year.

By 1971, the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press, holding weekly meetings of 200 to 300 people. The GLF Manifesto was published, and a series of high-profile direct actions, were carried out, such as the disruption of the launch of the Church-based morality campaign, Festival of Light.

The disruption of the opening of the 1971 Festival of Light was one of the most well-organised GLF actions. The first meeting of the Festival of Light was organised by Mary Whitehouse at Methodist Central Hall. Amongst GLF members taking part in this protest were the &quot;Radical Feminists&quot;, a group of gender non-conforming males in drag, who invaded and spontaneously kissed each other; others released mice, sounded horns, and unveiled banners, and a contingent dressed as workmen obtained access to the basement and shut off the lights.

Easter 1972 saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Students building at the University of Birmingham.
By 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement&#x27;s splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, &quot;Gay News&quot;, and Icebreakers. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources. GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester Gay Liberation Front founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local &quot;Gayline&quot;, which is still active today and has received funding from the National Lottery. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;, which refused to advertise Gayline&#x27;s services at the time.

The papers of the GLF are among the Hall-Carpenter Archives at the London School of Economics.

Several members of the GLF, including Peter Tatchell, continued campaigning beyond the 1970s under the organisation of OutRage!, which was founded in 1990 and dissolved in 2011, using similar tactics to the GLF (such as &quot;zaps&quot; and performance protest) to attract a significant level of media interest and controversy. It was at this point that a divide emerged within the gay activist movement, mainly due to a difference in ideologies, after which a number of groups including Organization for Lesbian and Gay Alliance (OLGA), the Lesbian Avengers, Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Dykes And Faggots Together (DAFT), Queer Nation, Stonewall (which focused on lobbying tactics) and OutRage! co-existed.

These groups were very influential following the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the 1980s and 1990s and the violence against lesbians and gay men that followed.

== Canada ==
The first gay liberation groups identifying with the Gay Liberation Front movement in Canada were in Montreal, Quebec. The &quot;Front de Libération Homosexuel&quot; (FLH) was formed in November 1970, in response to a call for organised activist groups in the city by the publication &quot;Mainmise.&quot;&quot; &quot;Another factor in the group&#x27;s formation was the response from police against gay establishments in the city after the suspension of civil liberties by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the fall of 1970. This group was short-lived; they were disbanded after over forty members were charged for failure to procure a liquor license at one of the group&#x27;s events in 1972.

A Vancouver, British Columbia group calling itself the Vancouver Gay Liberation Front emerged in 1971, mostly out of meetings from a local commune, called Pink Cheeks. The group gained support from &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;, a left-leaning newspaper, and opened a drop-in centre and published a newsletter. The group struggled to maintain a core group of members, and competition from other local groups, such as the Canadian Gay Activists Alliance (CGAA) and the Gay Alliance Toward Equality (GATE), soon led to its demise.

== Denmark ==
 (BBF; lit. &quot;The Gays&#x27; Liberation Front&quot;) was founded in Copenhagen in 1971, the name inspired by the American Gay Liberation Front. BBF was opposed to the already-established gay rights group &quot;Forbundet af 1948&quot; for being too formal. BBF&#x27;s activities included going to schools to educate about how it was like being gay, and civil disobedience against the law that prohibited men from publicly dancing together, which was eventually repealed in 1973. The group regularly met at &quot;Bøssehuset&quot; (lit. &quot;The gay house&quot;) in Christiania.

== New Zealand ==
Women&#x27;s Liberation and Māori activist Ngahuia Te Awekotuku initiated the foundation of the Auckland Gay Liberation Front in March 1972, alongside fellow University of Auckland students Nigel Baumber, Ray Waru, and others. In the following months Gay Liberation Fronts established in Wellington, Christchurch and Hamilton, with further groups founded in Rotorua, Nelson, Taranaki, and other places between 1973 and 1977. Gay Liberation groups carried out numerous direct action protests, including guerilla theatre performances, zaps, disrupting meetings of anti-gay groups like the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards, and pickets. Supporting the wellbeing of gays and helping them to come out was an early concern of the movement, leading to the formation of counselling services such as Gay-Aid in Wellington and Gays-An in Christchurch. A &quot;Gay Week&quot; was held from 29 May to 3 June 1972, featuring guerrilla theatre, a forum, dance, and teach-in.

Gay Liberation organizations were not always successful in these aims; sexism and transphobia in the movement also led to the establishment of separate lesbian-feminist and trans organizations, such as SHE - Sisters for Homophile Equality - founded in Christchurch in September 1973. Gay Liberation chapters also worked alongside groups such as Hedesthia, a social and political organization for transvestites and transsexuals.

<text>Oude Rijn (&quot;Old Rhine&quot;; not to be confused with the Alter Rhein) is the name of a long former bend in river Rhine in the Dutch province of Gelderland.

In summer the bend became too shallow to be navigable, and so between 1701 and 1709 it was cut off from the main waterway near the town of Lobith and replaced by the Pannerdens Kanaal. After the bend was dammed-up at Tolkamer, the Oude Rijn received little water from the Rhine proper. Instead, most of its inflow now comes from the small river Wild. Near the Oude Rijn are several more, smaller, Old Rhine branches. Together they are known as the &quot;Rijnstrangen&quot; (&quot;Rhine Bends&quot;), a wildlife reserve area that is part of the Gelderse Poort.

The Oude Rijn, which forms the border between the Dutch town of Lobith and the German town of Elten, was still used to relieve the overflow of the Rhine in times of flooding until the middle of the twentieth century. Opposite the town of Angeren, the Pannerdens Kanaal connects to the Oude Rijn, after which the river continues towards the sea as Nederrijn (Lower Rhine).

<text>James Wilson Grimes (October 20, 1816 – February 7, 1872) was an American politician, serving as the third Governor of Iowa and a United States Senator from Iowa.

==Biography==
Born in Deering, New Hampshire, Grimes graduated from Hampton Academy and attended Dartmouth College. He studied law, moved west and commenced practice in a settlement in &#x27;Black Hawk Purchase&#x27;, Wisconsin Territory, that was later incorporated as Burlington, Iowa. He also farmed. 

== Political Career ==

Grimes served as a member of the Iowa Territorial House of Representatives for the 1838–1839 and 1843–1844 terms. He served as Governor of Iowa from 1854 to 1858. While elected as a Whig in 1854, he was a guiding light in the Republican Party&#x27;s establishment in Iowa in 1855 and 1856.

=== U.S. Senate ===
Grimes was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1859 and reelected in 1865. He served in the Senate from March 4, 1859, until December 6, 1869, when he resigned due to ill health.

In the Senate, he served as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia (in the 37th and 38th Congresses), and the Committee on Naval Affairs (in the 39th through 41st Congresses). He also served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In 1861, Grimes was a member of the peace convention held in Washington, D.C., in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending Civil War. In December 1861, he introduced the senate bill which led to the creation of the Medal of Honor (initially only for Navy and Marine personnel).

During President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial, Grimes broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators and voted for acquittal. Senators William Pitt Fessenden, Joseph S. Fowler, Grimes, John B. Henderson, Lyman Trumbull, Peter G. Van Winkle, and Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who provided the decisive vote, defied their party and public opinion and voted against convicting Johnson because they were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. They were joined in bucking their party by three other Republican senators, James Dixon, James Rood Doolittle, Daniel Sheldon Norton After the trial, Congressman Benjamin Butler conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson&#x27;s acquittal. In Butler&#x27;s hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.

In 1869, after suffering a stroke, Grimes formally resigned from the Senate on December 6, 1869.

==Death and legacy==
Grimes died in Burlington on February 7, 1872, aged 55. He is buried in the Aspen Grove Cemetery in Burlington.

The plot of land that his home was once located on is now home to an elementary school that bears his name.

The town of Grimes, Iowa, is named for Grimes, as well as the Grimes State Office Building in Des Moines.

<text>The Tuscarawas River is a principal tributary of the Muskingum River, 129.9 miles (209 km) long, in northeastern Ohio in the United States. Via the Muskingum and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of on glaciated and unglaciated portions of the Allegheny Plateau.

==Route==

The river rises southwest of Hartville in northern Stark County, and initially flows westward, through Uniontown into southern Summit County, where it passes through the Portage Lakes area south of Akron, and Barberton. From Barberton the Tuscarawas flows generally south through Stark and Tuscarawas counties; the communities of Clinton, Canal Fulton, Massillon, Navarre, Bolivar, Zoar, Dover, and New Philadelphia were developed along its banks. South of New Philadelphia, the river turns southwest and west, flowing past Tuscarawas, Gnadenhutten, Port Washington, and Newcomerstown, sites of former Lenape people villages at the time of the American Revolutionary War, into Coshocton County, where it joins the Walhonding River at the city of Coshocton (a former major Lenape site) to form the Muskingum River.

From Barberton downstream, the Ohio and Erie Canal was constructed parallel to the river in 1828–30 to provide for improved transportation of products and passengers. Usage began declining in the 1850s, and the canal was damaged beyond repair by flooding in 1913. Portions of the canal&#x27;s towpath route are maintained as a hiking and bicycling trail.

According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Tuscarawas River has also been known historically by the names Little Muskingum River (or, &quot;East branch of the Muskingum&quot;), Mashongam River, Tuscarawa River, and Tuskarawas Creek, all derived from Native American terms.

, the state of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has recommended limits on the consumption of fish taken from the river, due to contamination by mercury and PCBs.

==Tributaries==
The Tuscarawas River collects Chippewa Creek in Summit County near Clinton, and Wolf Creek in Norton, and Sandy Creek in Stark County near Bolivar. In Tuscarawas County, it collects Conotton Creek southeast of Zoar; Sugar Creek at Dover; and Stillwater Creek north of Tuscarawas. Nimishillen Creek, a tributary of Sandy Creek, drains the city of Canton.

==Flow rate==
At the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s stream gauge in Newcomerstown, the annual mean flow of the river between 1922 and 2005 was 2,591 ft³/s (73 m³/s). The highest recorded flow during the period was 46,800 ft³/s (1,325 m³/s) on January 26, 1937. The lowest recorded flow was 216 ft³/s (6 m³/s) on August 15, 1944.

At an upstream gauge in Massillon, the annual mean flow of the river between 1938 and 2005 was 466 ft³/s (13 m³/s). The highest recorded flow during the period was 10,700 ft³/s (303 m³/s) on July 5, 1969. The lowest recorded flow was 45 ft³/s (1.3 m³/s) on September 20, 1999.
==In popular culture==
*Conrad Richter&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; (1953), features True Son recalling a memory set along the Tuscarawas River.
*The band Sun Kil Moon refers to the Tuscarawas in their song &quot;Carry Me, Ohio&quot;, with the lyric, &quot;Tuscarawas flows into the prairie land&quot;.

<text>Fremont Pass is a mountain pass in central Colorado, in the Rocky Mountains of the western United States.

It forms the continental divide on the border between Lake County and Summit County. The pass is named for John C. Frémont, an explorer of the American West who discovered the pass while traversing present-day Colorado during the 1840s. The pass provides a route between the upper valley of the Blue River, a tributary of the Colorado River, with the headwaters of the Arkansas River to the south. The pass summit is the site of Climax Mine, a molybdenum mine. The pass is traversed by State Highway 91.

Despite being one of the highest mountain passes in the state, the only steep part is the switchback on the final ascent toward the Climax mine on the south side. The rest of the pass is gentle.

== Climate == 
== Railway ==
The Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad built a narrow gauge railway over Fremont Pass in 1884. It was sold in foreclosure proceedings to the Denver, Leadville &amp; Gunnison Railroad in 1889 and became later part of the Colorado and Southern Railway. Operating ended in 1937. The line south of Climax is retained, converted to in 1943 and now operated by Leadville, Colorado and Southern Railroad.

A second narrow gauge railway line was built by Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1881. Passenger service ceased in late 1909 and the last sporadic freight service in November 1910. The line was abandoned on 1 December 1923.
== Electrical Power ==
In 1909, the Shoshone Transmission Line was built to connect a generating station near Glenwood Springs with Leadville and Denver. This historic electric transmission line has been modernized several times and is still in use, although the development of the Climax mine has caused major changes to the line in the vicinity of the pass.

<doc id="947730" wikidata="Q1986708" url="?curid=947730" title="Acura Legend">
<text>The Acura Legend is a mid-size luxury car manufactured by Honda from Japan. It was sold in the U.S. and Canada under Honda&#x27;s luxury brand, Acura, from 1985 until 1995. It was the first flagship sedan sold under the Acura nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the Acura 3.5RL. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend.

The opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had arisen with the 1980s voluntary export restraints, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales. The initial success of the Legend and Honda&#x27;s Acura division in competing against established European and American luxury manufacturers would lead to Toyota and Nissan creating the Lexus and Infiniti brands, respectively, to compete in the luxury car market.


==First generation (1986)==
Honda introduced the model in Japan on October 22, 1985, to be their premier luxury model, and in North America for the 1986 model year, as the top of the line model for its then-new Acura lineup. Sedan models came to the market first, powered by a 2.5 L C25A V6, with coupes making their first appearance in 1987, powered by a new 2.7 L C27A engine. Sedans received the new engine for 1988.

The Legend was the first production Honda vehicle to offer a V6 engine. The 1987 Acura Legend LS coupe would be the first Japanese car to offer a driver&#x27;s side airbag. The Legend was a result of a joint venture with Britain&#x27;s Austin Rover Group called Project XX that started in November 1981 with the Austin Rover-Honda XX letter of intent signed by the two companies to replace the Rover SD1 and to provide a luxury vehicle for Honda. The Rover Company had a long established reputation as a luxury car in the United Kingdom and Europe, demonstrated with the Rover P6, and Honda wanted to introduce a luxury car for both domestic Japanese and the United States markets. The joint development produced the Legend and the corresponding British version was the Rover 800-series, which was badged under the Sterling brand in the United States and competed with the Legend.

Rover also wanted to return to the American market when they had reportedly sold only 1,500 cars in 1971, and a brief return in 1980, selling 800 Rover SD1s by offering the Sterling.

The Legend won &quot;Car and Driver&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Ten Best&quot; three years in a row and &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Import Car of the Year&quot; for 1987. Manual-equipped models could accelerate from 0- in under 8 seconds and reach a top speed of . Sedan models had a drag coefficient of 0.32, while coupes were only 0.30.

When the Legend was introduced, Honda&#x27;s newly established luxury car division just for the Legend was called Acura, using the advertising slogan &quot;Precision Crafted Performance&quot;, and the Legend was offered with one factory installed option, the choice of transmission used, and one trim level. In the 1986 sales brochure, the Legend&#x27;s full name used was &quot;Legend Touring Sedan&quot;. The vehicle was virtually identical in luxury content to the Japanese market V6Zi, but was identical in size and the longer overall length of the top level V6Xi to comply with United States crash standards, using the larger 2.5 V6 engine. The Technics supplied 80W four speaker cassette tape stereo offered four user programmable equalizer settings, and was equipped with a dual diversity antenna, meaning it had a conventional extendable power antenna and an embedded antenna in the rear window. One of the novelty items was a simple volume control rocker switch and a pre-set radio station channel selector installed on the instrument binnacle within reach of the right hand; the opposite side of the instrument binnacle had a button to open, tilt or close the standard equipped glass moonroof with sun shade.

The North American Legend was not offered with some of the items offered in Japan, such as automatic, one-touch climate control, and 100% wool cloth interior in brown. Blue interior was shared with Japan and North America, but brown was not offered in North America, and &quot;sand gray&quot; was offered instead. Exterior colors were matched to only one interior color choice and leather was not offered. Due to the success Honda had with the Legend, it served as an inspiration for the Subaru Legacy with which it shares many visual resemblances and dimensions both inside and out.

In late 1988 for the 1989 model year, the sedan received some minor tweaks, upgrading to the one-piece front headlamps already in use in Japan since the 1985 introduction, a revised front bumper, trunk lid, tail light cluster, and an upgraded double-wishbone rear suspension, with a new alloy wheel appearance. By that time all Legends came equipped with a Honda-designed 4-wheel anti-lock brake system. A driver&#x27;s side airbag was now standard on all Legends. Other features such as power driver&#x27;s seat memory for 3 positions were added. High-end LS models featured a trip computer, electronic vehicle monitoring system in the center console and a Bose sound system. It was also joined by the Acura Vigor which set the stage for the larger second generation Legend introduced October 1990.

For the 1990 model year, all Legends came with body-colored side mirrors. Legend coupes had a revised body-colored front grille, new red &amp; clear tail lights, and improved front seats. LS model coupes also received a trunk-mounted lip spoiler. All LS models featured burlwood interior trim. Production of the first-generation models ended in 1990 as a second-generation version became available for the 1991 model year. At least by the 1990 model year, the fuel filler door on the sedan had been moved rearward about .

From the exterior, there are only superficial similarities between the Legend and its Rover 800/Sterling cousin. Both cars share the 2.5L and 2.7L Honda engine with and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The core structure and chassis design is also common to both cars, however the Rover version has its own exterior panelwork, interior and electrical systems. The Rover was also offered with a 2.0L in-line 4-cylinder engines, however the Legend was only available with V6 power regardless of market. In Japan only, Honda installed a turbocharger with variable geometry in the Legend with the smaller 2.0 L V6, called the &quot;Wing Turbo&quot; for model year 1989.

==Second generation (1991)==


Second generation units became available October 24, 1990, now using a SOHC (C32A) engine mated to either a standard 6-speed manual or an optional 4-speed automatic. The second generation Legend was a larger, more streamlined-looking car (drag coefficients were actually higher at 0.34 for sedans and 0.32 for coupes). The design was referred to as a &quot;fuselage&quot; shape, and had rear-wheel drive proportions which were possible thanks to the use of a longitudinally mounted engine; unusual for front-wheel-drive automobiles.

The Legend offered a host of features seen on luxury cars of today including dual front driver &amp; passenger airbags (standard on 1991 Legend LS, 1992 L and LS trims), speed-sensitive steering, hands-free telephone, automatic climate control, heated leather seats, heated mirrors, four-wheel ABS disc brakes, seatbelt pretensioners, and electric soft-close doors (coupe only).

Japan and New Zealand coupe/sedan models came factory with one-piece headlamps and built-in foglights. In Europe the Legend was fitted with all glass headlamps as well as built-in foglights, also a flush decklid spoiler option was available from factory (1991-1993 coupes only), similar to the USDM KA3/KA4 Legend first generation coupe/sedan option .
(1994-1995 coupe) rear decklids were excluded from Europe&#x27;s factory flush spoiler option, as they offered a slightly enhanced curvature of decklid in the later production years.

Japan, New Zealand &amp; Europe coupe/sedan models also came fitted with a one of a kind Honda alpha touring grille. North American models did not, however they did receive a factory option set of lower bumper guard foglights making all legend model interchangeable options endless.

Appearance of the sedan was adopted from the first generation Legend coupe and Honda also wanted to visually align the appearance of both the Legend coupe and sedan to the Acura NSX. Legend coupes also shared the same mirror design as the first generation NSX. The segment the Legend originally filled was now being served by the Acura Vigor which allowed the Legend to position itself more towards the rear drive Lexus LS and the Infiniti Q45 sedans. Honda decided not to upgrade the size of the engine to a V8 because it would have upstaged the Acura NSX which has a V6 that introduced Honda&#x27;s VTEC technology. 

For 1991 and 1992 the Legend sedan was available in &#x27;base&#x27;, &#x27;L&#x27;, and &#x27;LS&#x27; trims; the coupe remained available in L and LS through its entire run. The higher-end LS cars added automatic climate control, a power four-way passenger seat, burled walnut interior trim, and body colored side moldings. Honda made significant upgrades for 1993, making a &quot;Type II&quot; North America version of the SOHC C32A1 engine standard on all coupes, along with the option of a 6-speed manual transmission (for 1993-1995 coupes 1994-1995 sedan). The LS version of the sedan lost the option for a manual transmission and was only available with an automatic transmission from then on. 1993 also saw the addition of dual airbags as standard equipment in all trims, the deletion of the black molding on the entry-level cars, and a new wheel design with fewer spokes on the sedans (16-spoke vs. 20-spoke). To reach the higher output, the Type II engine has bigger intake valves, a higher lift camshaft, and an exhaust with freer flow.

For the 1994–95 model years, all Legends received new front bumper and trunk lid designs, a new front grille (L &amp; LS Sedans only), and a power tilt-telescoping steering column; the word &quot;Legend&quot; was now spelled out in individual letters on the back. The base sedan was dropped, while a new GS sedan became the new top-line variant, sporting the &quot;Type II&quot; engine, upgraded brakes from the coupe, sport suspension from the coupe, a body-colored version of the 1991 to 1993 grille, the same standard 6-speed manual transmission found on the coupes as well as the special 16-inch 5-spoke LS Coupe wheels (better known as &quot;GS Wheels&quot;). This was the only 6-speed sedan offered.

Added for 1995 was the limited-production &#x27;SE&#x27; sedan, which was essentially a Legend &#x27;L&#x27; with a two-tone paint scheme, pre-1993 15-inch 7-spoke &#x27;LS&#x27; coupe wheels, &quot;Special Edition&quot; floor mats, and an automatic transmission.

The Japan Domestic Market version of the 1990 Legend (second generation) was the second vehicle offered with a navigation system (electro Gyrocator). The tooling and intellectual property rights of the second generation Legend were licensed to Daewoo Motors of South Korea, where a clone of the Legend sedan, called the Daewoo Arcadia, was produced from 1994 to 1999. During this period, Honda also held a small stake in Daewoo Motors.

==Successor==
The Legend was a very successful vehicle to launch Acura as a separate division, and combined with sales of the Integra this resulted in Acura outselling longtime luxury marques BMW and Mercedes-Benz as well as Toyota&#x27;s new luxury division Lexus. Nonetheless Honda executives felt that the Legend nameplate was overshadowing the Acura marque in the United States, plus other luxury marques like Mercedes-Benz and BMW used alphanumeric designations, hence the third-generation Legend sedan would be badged as the RL for North America. The replacement for the Legend sedan was sold as the Acura RL for two generations and then the Acura RLX in North America, although Honda continued to sell it as the Legend in most other areas of the world. However the RL and RLX never achieved the sales success that the original Legend managed; by the early 2000s Acura sales would be dominated by the Acura MDX crossover 3-row SUV and the Acura TL front-wheel drive sedan while the RL contributed little, by contrast the Legend made up 40% of the marque&#x27;s sales volume during Acura&#x27;s early years. It can be said that the renaming of the Legend to the RL, as well as Honda&#x27;s refusal to adopt a front-engine rear-wheel drive layout which typify the more expensive luxury cars, had hurt sales of the RL and other Acura passenger cars.

<doc id="947734" wikidata="Q838378" url="?curid=947734" title="Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics">
<text>The men&#x27;s [[ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, was the 16th Olympic Championship. The Soviet Union won its seventh gold medal. The silver medal was won by Finland, marking its first ever Olympic ice hockey medal. Sweden won the bronze medal. Games were held in the Olympic Saddledome, the Stampede Corral, and Father David Bauer Olympic Arena. This is so far the only Olympic tournament held on North American soil that was not won by either Canada or United States.

The IIHF did not run a championship in Olympic years at this time. Nations that did not participate in the Calgary Olympics were invited to compete in the final Thayer Tutt Trophy.

==Background==
The Canadian team had defeated the favoured Soviets twice in the run-up to the Olympics and was considered a gold medal contender for the first time since 1968. The first win over the Soviet squad was particularly significant as it happened in the annual Izvestia tournament which was held in 1987 in Moscow and was considered a final shot before the Olympics. Unfortunately for the Canadians, these victories backfired as the Soviets prepared better for the Olympic tournament and won in a head-to-head match 5–0.

=== Tournament changes ===
The Calgary Organizing Committee (OCO&#x27;88) sought a revamped ice hockey tournament for the Games, which included more games played between the more competitive teams. In previous Olympic tournaments the top four teams advanced from the first round robin stage, Calgary intended to instead have six teams advance, which had the effect of increasing the total number of ice hockey games in the Olympics from 36 to 42. While the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was able to convince the IIHF to allow OCO&#x27;88 to schedule games after the match draws had occurred to ensure premier matches were held in the higher capacity Olympic Saddledome, the IIHF remained reluctant to increase the number of games noting it would extend the break for European leagues with players participating. Eventually the IIHF and IOC agreed to the increased number of games with some changes to financial payments to the IIHF.

=== Doping ===
Polish ice-hockey player Jarosław Morawiecki tested positive for the banned substance Testosterone during the Games. The 23 year old centre, who was considered Poland&#x27;s best player, exceeded the allowable limit of testosterone in random testing after a match which saw Poland defeat France 6–2. Polish coach Leszek Lejczyk claimed Morawiecki was deliberately drugged for political reasons.

The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned Morawiecki from competition for 18 months and invalidated Poland&#x27;s victory in the France match. Poland finished 5th of 6th in the tournament Group A standings.

==Medalists==

==Qualification==
The top eleven nations from the 1987 World Championships (eight from pool A, top three from pool B) qualified directly, while the twelfth ranked nation had to play off against the winner of that year&#x27;s pool C. France beat Japan 8 goals to 6.

<text>55 Cancri is a binary star system located 41 light-years away from the Sun in the zodiac constellation of Cancer. It has the Bayer designation Rho1 Cancri (ρ1 Cancri); &quot;55 Cancri&quot; is the Flamsteed designation (abbreviated 55 Cnc). The system consists of a K-type star (designated 55 Cancri A, also named Copernicus ) and a smaller red dwarf (55 Cancri B).

, five extrasolar planets (designated 55 Cancri b, c, d, e and f; named Galileo, Brahe, Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot, respectively) are known to orbit 55 Cancri A.

==Nomenclature==
55 Cancri is the system&#x27;s Flamsteed designation. It also bears the Bayer designation ρ1 Cancri (Latinised to Rho1 Cancri) and the Bright Star Catalogue designation HR 3522. The two components are designated A and B, though component A is sometimes referred to simply as 55 Cancri. The first planet discovered orbiting 55 Cancri A was designated HR 3522b by its discoverers, though it is more commonly referred to as 55 Cancri b. Under the rules for naming objects in binary star systems it should be named 55 Cancri Ab and this more formal form is occasionally used to avoid confusion with the secondary star 55 Cancri B. The other planets discovered were designated 55 Cancri c, d, e and f, in order of their discovery.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Copernicus for 55 Cancri A and Galileo, Brahe, Lipperhey, Janssen and Harriot for its planets (b, c, d, e and f, respectively).

The winning names were those submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. They honor the astronomers Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Tycho Brahe and Thomas Harriot and the spectacle makers and telescope pioneers Hans Lipperhey and Jacharias Janssen. (The IAU originally announced the winning name was Lippershey for 55 Cancri d. In January 2016, in recognition that his actual name was Lipperhey (with Lippershey an error introduced in the 19th century), the exoplanet name was corrected to Lipperhey by the IAU and that name was submitted to the official sites that keep track of astronomical information).

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

==Stellar system==
The 55 Cancri system is located fairly close to the Solar System: the &quot;Gaia&quot; astrometry satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 79.45 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of . 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just visible to the naked eye under very dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by , an estimated separation of (6.15 light-days). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.

===55 Cancri A===
The primary star, 55 Cancri A, has a spectral type of K0IV-V, indicating a main-sequence or subgiant star. It is smaller in radius and slightly less massive than the Sun, and so is cooler and less luminous. The star has only low emission from its chromosphere, and is not variable in the visible spectrum; but it is variable in X-rays. It is more enriched than the Sun in elements heavier than helium, with 186% the solar abundance of iron; it is therefore classified as a rare &quot;super metal-rich&quot; (SMR) star. 55 Cancri A also has more carbon than the Sun, with a C/O ratio of 0.78, compared to solar value of 0.55. This abundance of metal makes estimating the star&#x27;s age and mass difficult, as evolutionary models are less well defined for such stars. 55 Cancri A is much older than the solar system, and its age has been estimated to values of 7.4–8.7 billion years or 10.2 ± 2.5 billion years.

A hypothesis for the high metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star&#x27;s external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone would mean that the outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.

Observations of 55 Cancri A in the submillimeter region of the spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated dust. The upper limit on emissions within of this star is about 850 mJy, at a wavelength of 850 μm. This limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth&#x27;s mass. However, this does not exclude the presence of an asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.

===55 Cancri B===
The secondary, 55 Cancri B, is a red dwarf star much less massive and luminous than the Sun. There are indications that component B may itself be a double star, though this is uncertain.

==Planetary system==



The 55 Cancri system was the first known to have four, and later five, planets, and may possibly have more. The innermost planet, e, transits 55 Cancri A as viewed from Earth. The next planet, b, is non-transiting but there is tentative evidence that it is surrounded by an extended atmosphere that does transit the star.

In 1997, the discovery of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau Boötis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae. The planet was discovered by measuring the star&#x27;s radial velocity, which showed a periodicity of around 14.7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78% of the mass of Jupiter. These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted for by this planet, which could be explained by the gravitational influence of a more distant object.

In 1998 the discovery of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced. Calculations gave the disk radius at least 40 AU, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System, with an inclination of 25° with respect to the plane of the sky. However, the discovery could not be verified and was later deemed to be spurious, caused instead by background galaxies.
After making further radial velocity measurements, a planet orbiting at a distance of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star&#x27;s rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.
55 Cancri e was announced in 2004. With 8.3 Earth masses, it is a large super-Earth which was originally thought to have an orbital period of 2.8 days, though it was later found that this was an alias of its true period of 0.74 of a day by observations of e transiting in 2011. This planet was the first known instance of a fourth extrasolar planet in one system, and was the shortest-period planet until the discovery of PSR J1719−1438 b. The measurements that led to the discovery of this planet also confirmed the existence of 55 Cancri c.

In 2005, Jack Wisdom combined three data sets and drew two distinct conclusions: that the 2.8-day planet was an alias and that there was a Neptune-scale planet with a period near 261 days. Fischer et al. (2008) reported new observations that they said confirmed the existence of the 2.8-day planet, as first reported by McArthur et al. (2004), and a 260-day Neptune-sized planet, as first reported by Wisdom (2005). However, Dawson and Fabrycky (2010) concluded that the 2.8-day planet was indeed an alias, as suggested by Wisdom (2005), and that the correct period was 0.7365 of a day.

In 2007, Fisher et al. confirmed the existence of the 260-day planet proposed in 2005 by Wisdom. This planet, 55 Cancri f, was the first occurrence of a fifth extrasolar planet in one system. With a similar mass to c, it has a 260-day orbit, towards the inner edge of 55 Cancri A&#x27;s habitable zone. The planet itself is not thought to be conducive to life, but hypothetical moons in principle could maintain at least water and life.

The planet e&#x27;s eccentricity is poorly defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly improve the fit, so an eccentricity of 0.2 was assumed. Taking interactions between the planets into account results in a near-zero orbital eccentricity.

Astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° of the outer planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-sight, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c&#x27;s nor f&#x27;s inclinations have been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar in order to maintain stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.

The approximate ratios of periods of adjacent orbits are (proceeding outward): 1:20, 1:3, 1:6, 1:20. The nearly 1:3 ratio between 55 Cancri b and c is apparently a near resonance, rather than a genuine mean motion resonance.

=== Possible additional planets ===
Between planets f and d, there appears to be a huge gap of distance where no planets are known to orbit. A 2008 paper found that as many as 3 additional planets of up to 50 times the mass of Earth could orbit at a distance of 0.9 to 3.8 AU from the star, and stable resonances of a hypothetical planet g with the known planets were found to be 3f:2g, 2g:1d, and 3g:2d. A study released in 2019 showed that undiscovered terrestrial planets may be able to orbit safely in this region at 1 to 2 AU; this space includes the outer limits of 55 Cancri&#x27;s habitable Zone.
In 2021, it was found that terrestrial planets with comparable water content to Earth may have indeed been able to form and survive between the planets f and d.
As for the space outside d&#x27;s orbit, its stability zone begins beyond 10 AU, though there is a stability zone between 8.6 and 9 AU due to a 2:1 resonance.

===Search for Radio Emissions===
Since 55 Cancri e orbits less than 0.1 AU from its host star, some scientists hypothesized that it may cause stellar flaring synchronized to the orbital period of the exoplanet. A 2011 search for these magnetic star-planet interactions that would result in coronal radio emissions resulted in no detected signal. Furthermore, no magnetospheric radio emissions were detected from any exoplanet within the system.

==Communication==
A METI message was sent to 55 Cancri. It was transmitted from Eurasia&#x27;s largest radar—the Evpatoria Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 2; it was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 55 Cancri in May 2044.

<text>Myrl Howard Shoemaker (April 14, 1913 – July 30, 1985) was an American politician of the Democratic party who served as the 57th lieutenant governor of Ohio from 1983 until his death in 1985.

== Career ==
Shoemaker served for 24 years in the Ohio House of Representatives before being elected lieutenant governor in 1982 as running mate of Dick Celeste. Celeste&#x27;s choice of Shoemaker for Lieutenant Governor was pivotal for him to receive downstate support in the election to offset the political support of his opponent, U.S. Rep. Clarence J. &quot;Bud&quot; Brown Jr. Wags claimed that if elected, Celeste would be the Governor above Interstate 70 and Shoemaker would be the Governor below Interstate 70, the highway that bisects Ohio.

During his term as lieutenant governor, Shoemaker also served as director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Shoemaker was the first lieutenant governor in the United States to serve simultaneously in a governor&#x27;s cabinet as the head of a state department. He stepped down from the cabinet post on July 1, 1985, due to health problems.

== Death and legacy ==
Shoemaker died of cancer in 1985 while serving as lieutenant governor. He had been confined to his home in Bourneville for several months.

His son Mike Shoemaker succeeded him in the state house, and went on to serve in the Ohio State Senate

The Convocation center on the campus of the University of Cincinnati bears his name. The main arena has been sponsored by Fifth Third Bank since 2005, and is legally named &quot;Fifth Third Arena at Shoemaker Center&quot;.

<text>Michael C. Shoemaker (born 1945) is an American politician of the Democratic Party. He was born in 1945 in Nipgen, Ohio (Ross County). Shoemaker&#x27;s father, Myrl Shoemaker, was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio.

Shoemaker received a Bachelor of Science in education from Capital University in Columbus, Ohio, and a Master of Education from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. He began his 10-year teaching career as a math instructor and football coach in Southern Ohio. In 1977, he left education and started his own home construction business. In 1982, he was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives.

Shoemaker served from 1983 to 1997 in the Ohio House of Representatives after his father was elected lieutenant governor in 1982. He was appointed to the Ohio Senate in 1997. In 2002, his district was made significantly more Republican in redistricting, and he was defeated by State Representative John Carey. While a legislator, Shoemaker opposed school vouchers and supported greater accountability for homeschooling. He also sponsored legislation that led to the creation of the Ohio Department of Aging.

Shoemaker was appointed executive director of the Ohio School Facilities Commission by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland in February 2007. While a member of the Ohio General Assembly, Shoemaker opposed the creation of the OSFC, although he served for five years as a non-voting member from 1995 to 2000.

Shoemaker and his wife Kathy currently live near Circleville, Ohio.

<text>The Slick Aircraft Slick 360 is a South African aerobatics aircraft produced by the Slick Aircraft Company of Pretoria, South Africa. It is designed exclusively as an aerobatic competition aircraft, to compete in events such as the Advanced World Aerobatics Championships (AWAC).

==Development==
The Slick 360 was designed to fill a gap in the light aerobatic aircraft segment, as the aircraft which dominate this segment, the Yak-55, Zlin Z-50 and Extra 230 have all ceased production, making them increasingly hard to obtain. While other Extras are still in production (260, 300, 300S, 300L and 330), they are fitted with six-cylinder (260/300 hp) engines and therefore not allowed to compete in the AWAC. New aircraft have been created in an attempt to replace these three, such as the One Design and the Cap 222, but they have failed to dominate, purportedly due to their excessively-high aileron roll rates, which, being faster than their flick roll rates, results in the flick roll scores being downgraded. In addition, their small size has made them difficult to judge. The result being that neither of the two new designs has yet managed to achieve better results than the older established designs, with the past five AWAC events being won by the Extra 230, Zlin Z-50 and Yak-55. This was borne out by the winner of 2003 AWAC, who was a French pilot who chose to fly an Extra 230 despite the fact that he had access to the French team&#x27;s Cap 222.

Due to this, the Slick 360 was envisaged as a newer version of the Extra 230, using the same basic concept and design, but with as many upgrades and improvements as possible. To this end, the size, basic wing shape and control system of the Extra 230 were used as the basis for the new aircraft, but the flick roll characteristics were designed to be closer to that of the Laser, from which the Extra 230 was originally derived.

The aircraft&#x27;s wings were made from a carbon-fibre composite material, and designed by François Jordaan, an aeronautical and structural engineer who had previously designed the wings of the Celstar aerobatic glider and the Ravin 500. In addition to the improvements made to the wing itself, the latest aileron designs were fitted, giving the aircraft a roll rate of around 400 degrees per second.

The aircraft is fitted with a Lycoming AEIO-360-A1B6 engine from AeroSport Power of Canada, which is a fully aerobatic-qualified engine with only one restriction due to the oil system: The pilot is restricted to 10 seconds of vertical flight or steep dives; inverted flight, steep dive; zero &quot;g&quot; manoeuvres and wing-down or knife-edge flights.

==Operational history==
The Slick 360 is in production and to date 9 have been sold.

However, the pre-production Slick 360 took part in the South African National Aerobatics Championships in June 2004, achieving the unusual distinction of winning the event in its first outing.

<doc id="947771" wikidata="Q2115226" url="?curid=947771" title="Litija">
<text>Litija (; ) is a town in the Litija Basin in central Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Litija. It is located in the valley of the Sava River, east of the capital Ljubljana, in the traditional region of Upper Carniola. The entire municipality is now included in the Central Sava Statistical Region; until January 2014 it was part of the Central Slovenia Statistical Region. The town is home to about 6,500 people.

==Name==
Litija was mentioned in written documents in 1256 as &quot;apud Litigiam&quot; and &quot;apud Lvtyam&quot; (and as &quot;Lutya&quot; in 1363, &quot;Littai&quot; in 1431, &quot;Luttey&quot; in 1444, and &quot;propre Lutiam&quot; in 1480). Medieval transcriptions indicate that the name was originally *&quot;Ljutija&quot;, derived from *&quot;Ľutoviďa (vьsь)&quot; (literally, &#x27;Ľutovidъ&#x27;s village&#x27;). Suggestions that &quot;-ija&quot; is a suffix or that the name is derived from German &quot;Lutte&quot; &#x27;(mining) drain&#x27; are less likely. Other pseudoetymologies include Johann Weikhard von Valvasor&#x27;s suggestion that the name evolved from &quot;litus&quot;, the Latin word for &#x27;riverbank&#x27;. The town was officially known as &quot;Littai&quot; in German until 1918.

==History==
Litija developed as a trading post between Trieste, Ljubljana, and Croatia. The town gained market rights in the 14th century. In Roman times mining developed in Litija and remained one of the primary sources of income until the 1965, when the biggest of the mines closed. In 1849 the Austrian Southern Railway reached Litija and boosted its economy. This development, however, also meant a decline in some of the traditional local professions. The Litija post office was opened in December 1852. After the Second World War, Litija annexed the formerly independent settlements of Podsitarjevec, Gradec, Grbin, and Podkraj.

==Landmarks==

The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana. The current building was built in 1884 and extended in 1997.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Litija include:
*France Bezlaj (1910–1993), linguist
*Luka Svetec (1826–1921), politician
*Peter Jereb (1867–1951), composer
*Viktor Parma (1858–1924), composer
*Rudolf Badjura (1881–1963), writer and mountaineer
*Mira Pregelj (1905–1966), painter
*Milan Borišek (1920–1950), glider pilot

<doc id="947773" wikidata="Q6536632" url="?curid=947773" title="Lewis H. Brown">
<text>Lewis Herold Brown (February 13, 1894February 27, 1951) was an industrialist and former chairman of Johns Manville, once the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of asbestos and asbestos products.

==Early life and career==
Born in Creston, Iowa on February 13, 1894, he attended the University of Iowa in 1915. Brown served in France as an infantry captain during World War I. After the war, Brown was employed by Montgomery Ward and was promoted to Assistant General Operating Manager within eight years.

==Johns-Manville and the Asbestos Institute==
T.F. Merseles, the President of Montgomery Ward, left in 1928 to become President of asbestos manufacturer Johns Manville, taking Brown with him. Merseles died suddenly in 1930 and Brown was appointed president at the age of 35.
He thereby became the youngest man ever to hold that position in the company&#x27;s history. He was also President of the Asbestos Institute.

Brown was awarded The Franklin Institute&#x27;s Vermilye Medal in 1938. In April 1939, Brown was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; with the caption &quot;Businessman Brown -- Public Relations Begins at Home.&quot; 

Brown was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Laws) from Brown University in June 1943. 

==&quot;A Report on Germany&quot;==
During World War II Brown served as an advisor to General Levin H. Campbell, Jr. After World War II, at the request of General Lucius D. Clay, Brown wrote a book entitled &quot;A Report on Germany&quot; (Farrar, Straus and Company, New York, 1947), which served as a detailed recommendation for the reconstruction of post-war Germany, and served as a basis for the Marshall Plan.

==Later life==
Brown founded the American Enterprise Association (AEA) in New York, a think tank which later moved to Washington, D.C., and was renamed the American Enterprise Institute. He served as AEA&#x27;s chairman until his death. Brown also co-founded the Tax Foundation and served as chairman.

Brown died from a heart ailment on February 27, 1951, at age 57, in Delray Beach, Florida. He was buried in Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich CT.

==Controversy==
In 1984, thirty-three years after Brown&#x27;s death, Johns-Manville was alleged to have prioritized profits over the health and safety of employees during the time of his leadership. According to testimony given in a federal court by Charles H. Roemer, formerly an employee of Unarco, describing a meeting between Unarco officials, Lewis H. Brown and J-M attorney Vandiver Brown in the early 1940s, &quot;I’ll never forget, I turned to Mr. Brown, one of the Browns made this crack (that Unarco managers were a bunch of fools for notifying employees who had asbestosis), and I said, ‘Mr. Vandiver Brown do you mean to tell me you would let them work until they dropped dead?’ He said, ‘Yes. We save a lot of money that way.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="947774" wikidata="Q780522" url="?curid=947774" title="English phonology">
<text>English phonology is the system of speech sounds used in spoken English. Like many other languages, English has wide variation in pronunciation, both historically and from dialect to dialect. In general, however, the regional dialects of English share a largely similar (but not identical) phonological system. Among other things, most dialects have vowel reduction in unstressed syllables and a complex set of phonological features that distinguish fortis and lenis consonants (stops, affricates, and fricatives).

Phonological analysis of English often concentrates on prestige or standard accents, such as Received Pronunciation for England, General American for the United States, and General Australian for Australia. Nevertheless, many other dialects of English are spoken, which have developed differently from these standardized accents, particularly regional dialects. Descriptions of standardized reference accents provide only a limited guide to the phonology of other dialects of English.

==Phonemes==
A phoneme of a language or dialect is an abstraction of a speech sound or of a group of different sounds that are all perceived to have the same function by speakers of that particular language or dialect. For example, the English word &quot;through&quot; consists of three phonemes: the initial &quot;th&quot; sound, the &quot;r&quot; sound, and a vowel sound. The phonemes in that and many other English words do not always correspond directly to the letters used to spell them (English orthography is not as strongly phonemic as that of many other languages).

The number and distribution of phonemes in English vary from dialect to dialect, and also depend on the interpretation of the individual researcher. The number of consonant phonemes is generally put at 24 (or slightly more depending on the dialect). The number of vowels is subject to greater variation; in the system presented on this page there are 20–25 vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, 14–16 in General American and 19–21 in Australian English. The pronunciation keys used in dictionaries generally contain a slightly greater number of symbols than this, to take account of certain sounds used in foreign words and certain noticeable distinctions that may not be—strictly speaking—phonemic.

=== Consonants ===
The following table shows the 24 consonant phonemes found in most dialects of English, plus , whose distribution is more limited. Fortis consonants are always voiceless, aspirated in syllable onset (except in clusters beginning with or ), and sometimes also glottalized to an extent in syllable coda (most likely to occur with , see T-glottalization), while lenis consonants are always unaspirated and un-glottalized, and generally partially or fully voiced. The alveolars are usually apical, i.e. pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching or approaching the roof of the mouth, though some speakers produce them laminally, i.e. with the blade of the tongue.

====Consonant examples====
The following table shows typical examples of the occurrence of the above consonant phonemes in words, using minimal pairs where possible.
====Sonorants====
* The pronunciation of varies by dialect:
** Received Pronunciation has two main allophones of : the clear or plain (the &quot;light L&quot;), and the dark or velarized (the &quot;dark L&quot;). The clear variant is used before vowels when they are in the same syllable, and the dark variant when the precedes a consonant or is in syllable-final position before silence.
** In South Wales, Ireland, and the Caribbean, is usually clear, and in North Wales, Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand it is usually dark.
** In General American and Canada, is generally dark, but to varying degrees: before stressed vowels it is neutral or only slightly velarized. In southern U.S. accents it is noticeably clear between vowels, and in some other positions.
** In urban accents of Southern England, as well as New Zealand and some parts of the United States, can be pronounced as an approximant or semivowel () at the end of a syllable (&quot;l&quot;-vocalization).
* Depending on dialect, has at least the following allophones in varieties of English around the world (see Pronunciation of English /r/):
** postalveolar approximant (the most common realization of the phoneme, occurring in most dialects, RP and General American included)
** retroflex approximant (occurs in most Irish dialects and some American dialects)
** labiodental approximant (occurs in south-east England and some London accents; known as &quot;r&quot;-labialization)
** alveolar flap (occurs in most Scottish, Welsh, Indian and some South African dialects, some conservative dialects in England and Ireland; not to be confused with flapping of and )
** alveolar trill (occurs in some very conservative Scottish dialects and some Indian, South African and Welsh accents)
** voiced uvular fricative (occurs in northern Northumbria, largely disappeared; known as the Northumbrian burr)
* In most dialects is labialized in many positions, as in &quot;reed&quot; and &quot;tree&quot; ; in the latter case, the may be slightly labialized as well.
* In some rhotic accents, such as General American, when not followed by a vowel is realized as an r-coloring of the preceding vowel or its coda: &quot;nurse&quot; , &quot;butter&quot; .
* The distinctions between the nasals are neutralized in some environments. For example, before a final , or there is nearly always only one nasal sound that can appear in each case: , or respectively (as in the words &quot;limp&quot;, &quot;lint&quot;, &quot;link&quot; – note that the &quot;n&quot; of &quot;link&quot; is pronounced ). This effect can even occur across syllable or word boundaries, particularly in stressed syllables: &quot;synchrony&quot; is pronounced whereas &quot;synchronic&quot; may be pronounced with either or . For other possible syllable-final combinations, see in the Phonotactics section below.

====Obstruents====
In most dialects, the fortis stops and affricate have various different allophones, and are distinguished from the lenis stops and affricate by several phonetic features.
* The allophones of the fortes include:
**aspirated when they occur in the onset of a stressed syllable, as in &quot;potato&quot;. In clusters involving a following liquid, the aspiration typically manifests as the devoicing of this liquid. These sounds are unaspirated after within the same syllable, as in &quot;stan, span, scan&quot;, and at the ends of syllables, as in &quot;mat&quot;, &quot;map&quot;, &quot;mac&quot;. The voiceless fricatives are nearly always unaspirated, but a notable exception is English-speaking areas of Wales, where they are often aspirated.
** In many accents of English, fortis stops are glottalized in some positions. That may be heard either as a glottal stop preceding the oral closure (&quot;pre-glottalization&quot; or &quot;glottal reinforcement&quot;) or as a substitution of the glottal stop for the oral stop (glottal replacement). can be only pre-glottalized. Pre-glottalization normally occurs in British and American English when the fortis consonant phoneme is followed by another consonant or when the consonant is in final position. Thus &quot;football&quot; and &quot;catching&quot; are often pronounced and , respectively. Even more frequently, glottal replacement happens in such cases involving , so that &quot;football&quot; is pronounced . In addition, however, glottal replacement is increasingly common in British English when occurs between vowels if the preceding vowel is stressed; thus &quot;better&quot; is often pronounced by younger speakers as . Such &quot;t&quot;-glottalization also occurs in many British regional accents, including Cockney, where it can also occur at the end of words, and where and are sometimes treated the same way.
**For some RP-speakers, final voiceless stops, especially , may become ejectives.
* Among stops, both fortes and lenes:
** May have no audible release in the word-final position. These allophones are more common in North America than Great Britain.
** Almost always have a masked release before another plosive or affricate (as in &quot;rubbed&quot; ), i.e. the release of the first stop is made after the closure of the second stop. This also applies when the following stop is homorganic (articulated in the same place), as in &quot;top player&quot;. A notable exception is Welsh English in which stops are usually released in that environment.
** The affricates have a mandatory fricative release in all environments.
* Very often in the United States and Canada and less frequently in Australia and New Zealand, both can be pronounced as a voiced flap in certain positions: when they come between a preceding stressed vowel (possibly with intervening ) and precede an unstressed vowel or syllabic . Examples include &quot;water&quot;, &quot;bottle&quot;, &quot;petal&quot;, &quot;peddle&quot; (the last two words sound alike when flapped). The flap may even appear at word boundaries, as in &quot;put it on&quot;. When the combination appears in such positions, some American speakers pronounce it as a nasalized flap that may become indistinguishable from , so &quot;winter&quot; may be pronounced similarly or identically to &quot;winner&quot; .
*Yod-coalescence is a process that palatalizes the clusters , , and into , , and respectively, frequently occurring with clusters that would be considered to span a syllable boundary. 
**Yod-coalescence in stressed syllables, such as in &quot;tune&quot; and &quot;dune&quot;, occurs in Australian, Cockney, Estuary English, Hiberno-English (some speakers), Newfoundland English, South African English, and to a certain extent in New Zealand English and Scottish English (many speakers). This can lead to additional homophony; for instance, &quot;dew&quot; and &quot;due&quot; come to be pronounced the same as &quot;Jew&quot;.
**In certain varieties such as Australian English, South African English, and New Zealand English, and in stressed syllables can coalesce into and , respectively. In Australian English for example, &quot;assume&quot; is pronounced by some speakers. Furthermore, some British, Canadian, American, New Zealand and Australian speakers may change the sound to before , so that a word having a cluster of like in &quot;strewn&quot; would be pronounced . 
* The postalveolar consonants are strongly labialized: .
* In addition to , the sequences also have affricate-like realizations in certain positions (as in &quot;cats, roads, tram, dram, eighth, behind them, cupful, obvious&quot;; see also ), but usually only are considered to constitute the monophonemic affricates of English because (among other reasons) only they are found in all of morpheme-initial, -internal, and -final positions, and native speakers typically perceive them as single units.

===Vowels===
English, much like other Germanic languages, has a particularly large number of vowel phonemes, and in addition the vowels of English differ considerably between dialects. Consequently, corresponding vowels may be transcribed with various symbols depending on the dialect under consideration. When considering English as a whole, lexical sets are often used, each named by a word containing the vowel or vowels in question. For example, the set consists of words which, like &quot;lot&quot;, have in British Received Pronunciation (RP) and in General American (GA). The &quot; vowel&quot; then refers to the vowel that appears in those words in whichever dialect is being considered, or (at a greater level of abstraction) to a diaphoneme, which represents this interdialectal correspondence. A commonly-used system of lexical sets, devised by John C. Wells, is presented below; for each set, the corresponding phonemes are given for RP and General American, using the notation that will be used on this page.





For a table that shows the pronunciations of these vowels in a wider range of English accents, see Sound correspondences between English accents.

The following tables show the vowel phonemes of three standard varieties of English. The notation system used here for Received Pronunciation (RP) is fairly standard; the others less so. The feature descriptions given here (front, close, etc.) are abstracted somewhat; the actual pronunciations of these vowels are somewhat more accurately conveyed by the IPA symbols used (see Vowel for a chart indicating the meanings of these symbols; though note also the points listed below the following tables). The symbols given in the table are traditional but redirect to their modern implementation.





The differences between these tables can be explained as follows:
* General American lacks a phoneme corresponding to RP (, ), instead using in the words and generally in the words. In a few North American accents, namely in Eastern New England (Boston) words do not have the vowel of (the &quot;father&quot;–&quot;bother&quot; merger has not occurred) but instead merge with .
* Although the notation is used for the vowel of in RP and General American, the actual pronunciation in RP may be closer to a near-open central vowel , especially among older speakers. In modern RP, this vowel is increasingly realized as to avoid the clash with the lowered variety of in the region (the &quot;trap&quot;–&quot;strut&quot; merger). In General American, is realized as .
* RP transcriptions use rather than largely for convenience and historical tradition; it does not necessarily represent a different sound from the General American phoneme, as the vowel is generally realized as in modern RP.
* The different notations used for the vowel of in RP and General American ( and ) reflect a difference in the most common phonetic realizations of that vowel.
* The triphthongs given in the RP table are usually regarded as sequences of two phonemes (a diphthong plus ); however, in RP, these sequences frequently undergo smoothing into single diphthongs or even monophthongs.
* The different notations used here for some of the Australian vowels reflect the phonetic realization of those vowels in Australian: a central rather than in , a more closed rather than in , a close-mid rather than traditional RP&#x27;s in , an open-mid rather than traditional RP&#x27;s in , an opener rather than somewhat closer in , a central rather a back in and , and somewhat different pronunciations of most of the diphthongs. Note that central in , close-mid in and open-mid in are standard realizations in modern RP and the difference between modern RP and Australian English in these vowels lies almost only in transcription, rather than pronunciation.
* Both Australian and RP are long monophthongs, the difference between them being in tongue height: Australian is close-mid , whereas the corresponding RP vowel is open-mid .

Other points to be noted are these:
* The vowel is generally pronounced more open, approaching , by modern RP speakers. In American speech, however, there is a tendency for it to become more closed, tenser and even diphthongized (to something like ), particularly in certain environments, such as before a nasal consonant, though younger speakers of some varieties are lowering like RP speakers (see Canadian shift). Some American accents, for example those of New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore, make a marginal phonemic distinction between and , although the two occur largely in mutually exclusive environments. See :/æ/ raising.
* A significant number of words (the group) have in General American, but in RP. The pronunciation varies between and in Australia, with speakers from South Australia using more extensively than speakers from other regions.
* In General American and Canadian (which are rhotic accents, where is pronounced in positions where it does not precede a vowel), many of the vowels can be r-colored by way of realization of a following . This is often transcribed phonetically using a vowel symbol with an added retroflexion diacritic ; thus the symbol has been created for an r-colored schwa (sometimes called schwar) as in , and the vowel of can be modified to make so that the word &quot;start&quot; may be transcribed . Alternatively, the sequence might be written to indicate an r-colored offglide. The vowel of is generally always r-colored in these dialects, and this can be written (or as a syllabic ).
* In modern RP and other dialects, many words from the group are coming to be pronounced by an increasing number of speakers with the vowel (so &quot;sure&quot; is often pronounced like &quot;shore&quot;).
* The vowels of and are commonly pronounced as narrow diphthongs, approaching and , in RP. Near-RP speakers may have particularly marked diphthongization of the type and , respectively. In General American, the pronunciation varies between a monophthong and a diphthong.

====Allophones of vowels====
Listed here are some of the significant cases of allophony of vowels found within standard English dialects.
*Vowels are shortened when followed in a syllable by a voiceless (fortis) consonant. This is known as &quot;pre-fortis clipping&quot;. Thus in the following word pairs the first item has a shortened vowel while the second has a normal length vowel: &#x27;right&#x27; – &#x27;ride&#x27; ; &#x27;face&#x27; – &#x27;phase&#x27; ; &#x27;advice&#x27; – &#x27;advise&#x27; .
* In many accents of English, tense vowels undergo breaking before , resulting in pronunciations like for &quot;peel&quot;, for &quot;pool&quot;, for &quot;pail&quot;, and for &quot;pole&quot;.
* In RP, the vowel may be pronounced more back, as , before syllable-final , as in &quot;goal&quot;. In standard Australian English the vowel is similarly backed to before . A similar phenomenon occurs in Southern American English.
* The vowel is often pronounced in open syllables.
* The and diphthongs may be pronounced with a less open starting point when followed by a voiceless consonant; this is chiefly a feature of Canadian speech (Canadian raising), but is also found in parts of the United States. Thus &quot;writer&quot; may be distinguished from &quot;rider&quot; even when flapping causes the and to be pronounced identically.

====Unstressed syllables====
Unstressed syllables in English may contain almost any vowel, but in practice vowels in stressed and unstressed syllables tend to use different inventories of phonemes. In particular, long vowels are used less often in unstressed syllables than stressed syllables. Additionally there are certain sounds—characterized by central position and weakness—that are particularly often found as the nuclei of unstressed syllables. These include:
* schwa, , as in and (in non-rhotic dialects) (– merger); also in many other positions such as &quot;about&quot;, &quot;photograph&quot;, &quot;paddock&quot;, etc. This sound is essentially restricted to unstressed syllables exclusively. In the approach presented here it is identified as a phoneme , although other analyses do not have a separate phoneme for schwa and regard it as a reduction or neutralization of other vowels in syllables with the lowest degree of stress.
* r-colored schwa, , as in in General American and some other rhotic dialects, which can be identified with the underlying sequence .
* syllabic consonants: as in &quot;bottle, as in &quot;button, as in &quot;rhythm&quot;. These may be phonemized either as a plain consonant or as a schwa followed by a consonant; for example &quot;button&quot; may be represented as or (see above under Consonants).
* , as in &quot;roses&quot; and &quot;making&quot;. This can be identified with the phoneme , although in unstressed syllables it may be pronounced more centrally, and for some speakers (particularly in Australian and New Zealand and some American English) it is merged with in these syllables (weak vowel merger). Among speakers who retain the distinction there are many cases where free variation between and is found, as in the second syllable of &quot;typical&quot;. (The OED has recently adopted the symbol to indicate such cases.)
* , as in &quot;argument&quot;, &quot;today&quot;, for which similar considerations apply as in the case of . (The symbol is sometimes used in these cases, similarly to .) Some speakers may also have a rounded schwa, , used in words like &quot;omission&quot; .
* , as in &quot;happy, &quot;coffee, in many dialects (others have in this position). The phonemic status of this is not easy to establish. Some authors consider it to correspond phonemically with a close front vowel that is neither the vowel of nor that of ; it occurs chiefly in contexts where the contrast between these vowels is neutralized, implying that it represents an archiphoneme, which may be written . Many speakers, however, do have a contrast in pairs of words like &quot;studied&quot; and &quot;studded&quot; or &quot;taxis&quot; and &quot;taxes&quot;; the contrast may be vs. , vs. or vs. , and thus some authors consider that the &quot;happY&quot;-vowel should be identified phonemically either with the vowel of or that of , depending on the speaker. See also &quot;happy&quot;-tensing.
* , as in &quot;influence&quot;, &quot;to each&quot;. This is the back rounded counterpart to described above; its phonemic status is treated in the same works as cited there.

Vowel reduction in unstressed syllables is a significant feature of English. Syllables of the types listed above often correspond to a syllable containing a different vowel (&quot;full vowel&quot;) used in other forms of the same morpheme where that syllable is stressed. For example, the first &quot;o&quot; in &quot;photograph&quot;, being stressed, is pronounced with the vowel, but in &quot;photography&quot;, where it is unstressed, it is reduced to schwa. Also, certain common words (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, etc.) are pronounced with a schwa when they are unstressed, although they have different vowels when they are in a stressed position (see Weak and strong forms in English).

Some unstressed syllables, however, retain full (unreduced) vowels, i.e. vowels other than those listed above. Examples are the in ambition&quot; and the in &quot;finite&quot;. Some phonologists regard such syllables as not being fully unstressed (they may describe them as having &quot;tertiary stress&quot;); some dictionaries have marked such syllables as having secondary stress. However linguists such as Ladefoged and regard this as a difference purely of vowel quality and not of stress, and thus argue that vowel reduction itself is phonemic in English. Examples of words where vowel reduction seems to be distinctive for some speakers include &quot;chickaree vs. &quot;chicory (the latter has the reduced vowel of , whereas the former has the vowel without reduction), and &quot;Pharaoh vs. &quot;farrow&quot; (both have the vowel, but in the latter word it may reduce to ).

==Lexical stress==

Lexical stress is phonemic in English. For example, the noun increase&quot; and the verb &quot;increase are distinguished by the positioning of the stress on the first syllable in the former, and on the second syllable in the latter. (See initial-stress-derived noun.) Stressed syllables in English are louder than non-stressed syllables, as well as being longer and having a higher pitch.

In traditional approaches, in any English word consisting of more than one syllable, each syllable is ascribed one of three degrees of stress: &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;unstressed&quot;. Ordinarily, in each such word there will be exactly one syllable with primary stress, possibly one syllable having secondary stress, and the remainder are unstressed (unusually-long words may have multiple syllables with secondary stress). For example, the word &quot;amazing&quot; has primary stress on the second syllable, while the first and third syllables are unstressed, whereas the word &quot;organization&quot; has primary stress on the fourth syllable, secondary stress on the first, and the second, third, and fifth unstressed. This is often shown in pronunciation keys using the IPA symbols for primary and secondary stress (which are ˈ and ˌ respectively), placed before the syllables to which they apply. The two words just given may therefore be represented (in RP) as and .

Some analysts identify an additional level of stress (&quot;tertiary&quot; stress). This is generally ascribed to syllables that are pronounced with less force than those with secondary stress, but nonetheless contain a &quot;full&quot; or &quot;unreduced&quot; vowel (vowels that are considered to be reduced are listed under above). Hence the third syllable of &quot;organization&quot;, if pronounced with as shown above (rather than being reduced to or ), might be said to have tertiary stress. (The precise identification of secondary and tertiary stress differs between analyses; dictionaries do not generally show tertiary stress, although some have taken the approach of marking all syllables with unreduced vowels as having at least secondary stress.)

In some analyses, then, the concept of lexical stress may become conflated with that of vowel reduction. An approach that attempts to separate both is provided by Peter Ladefoged, who states that it is possible to describe English with only one degree of stress, as long as unstressed syllables are phonemically distinguished for vowel reduction. In this approach, the distinction between primary and secondary stress is regarded as a phonetic or prosodic detail rather than a phonemic feature – primary stress is seen as an example of the predictable &quot;tonic&quot; stress that falls on the &quot;final&quot; stressed syllable of a prosodic unit. For more details of this analysis, see Stress and vowel reduction in English.

For stress as a prosodic feature (emphasis of particular words within utterances), see below.

==Phonotactics==
Phonotactics is the study of the sequences of phonemes that occur in languages and the sound structures that they form. In this study it is usual to represent consonants in general with the letter C and vowels with the letter V, so that a syllable such as &#x27;be&#x27; is described as having CV structure. The IPA symbol used to show a division between syllables is the full stop . Syllabification is the process of dividing continuous speech into discrete syllables, a process in which the position of a syllable division is not always easy to decide upon.

Most languages of the world syllabify and sequences as and or , with consonants preferentially acting as the onset of a syllable containing the following vowel. According to one view, English is unusual in this regard, in that stressed syllables attract following consonants, so that and syllabify as and , as long as the consonant cluster is a possible syllable coda; in addition, preferentially syllabifies with the preceding vowel even when both syllables are unstressed, so that occurs as . This is the analysis used in the &quot;Longman Pronunciation Dictionary&quot;. However, this view is not widely accepted, as explained in the following section.

===Syllable structure===

English allows clusters of up to three consonants in the syllable onset and up to four consonants in the syllable coda, giving a general syllable structure of (C)3V(C)4, a potential example being &quot;strengths&quot; (although this word has variant pronunciations with only 3 coda consonants, such as ). A five-consonant coda may occur in the word &quot;angsts&quot;, but this is a highly exceptional case, as the word is both infrequent and not always pronounced with five final segments (it can be analyzed as a VC4 syllable rather than as VC5 ). From the phonetic point of view, the analysis of syllable structures is a complex task: because of widespread occurrences of articulatory overlap, English speakers rarely produce an audible release of individual consonants in consonant clusters. This coarticulation can lead to articulatory gestures that seem very much like deletions or complete assimilations. For example, &quot;hundred pounds&quot; may sound like and &quot;jumped back&quot; (in slow speech, ) may sound like , but X-ray and electropalatographic studies demonstrate that inaudible and possibly weakened contacts or lingual gestures may still be made. Thus the second in &quot;hundred pounds&quot; does not entirely assimilate to a labial place of articulation, rather the labial gesture co-occurs with the alveolar one; the &quot;missing&quot; in &quot;jumped back&quot; may still be articulated, though not heard.

Division into syllables is a difficult area, and different theories have been proposed. A widely accepted approach is the maximal onset principle: this states that, subject to certain constraints, any consonants in between vowels should be assigned to the following syllable. Thus the word &quot;leaving&quot; should be divided rather than *, and &quot;hasty&quot; is rather than * or *. However, when such a division results in an onset cluster that is not allowed in English, the division must respect this. Thus if the word &quot;extra&quot; were divided * the resulting onset of the second syllable would be , a cluster that does not occur initially in English. The division is therefore preferred. If assigning a consonant or consonants to the following syllable would result in the preceding syllable ending in an unreduced short vowel, this is avoided. Thus the word &quot;lemma&quot; should be divided and not *, even though the latter division gives the maximal onset to the following syllable.

In some cases, no solution is completely satisfactory: for example, in British English (RP) the word &quot;hurry&quot; could be divided or , but the former would result in an analysis with a syllable-final (which is held to be non-occurring) while the latter would result in a syllable final (which is said not to occur in this accent). Some phonologists have suggested a compromise analysis where the consonant in the middle belongs to both syllables, and is described as ambisyllabic. In this way, it is possible to suggest an analysis of &quot;hurry&quot; that comprises the syllables and , the medial being ambisyllabic. Where the division coincides with a word boundary, or the boundary between elements of a compound word, it is not usual in the case of dictionaries to insist on the maximal onset principle in a way that divides words in a counter-intuitive way; thus the word &quot;hardware&quot; would be divided by the maximal onset principle, but dictionaries prefer the division .

In the approach used by the &quot;Longman Pronunciation Dictionary&quot;, Wells claims that consonants syllabify with the preceding rather than following vowel when the preceding vowel is the nucleus of a more salient syllable, with stressed syllables being the most salient, reduced syllables the least, and full unstressed vowels (&quot;secondary stress&quot;) intermediate. But there are lexical differences as well, frequently but not exclusively with compound words. For example, in &quot;dolphin&quot; and &quot;selfish,&quot; Wells argues that the stressed syllable ends in , but in &quot;shellfish,&quot; the belongs with the following syllable: → , but → , where the is a little longer and the is not reduced. Similarly, in &quot;toe-strap&quot; Wells argues that the second is a full plosive, as usual in syllable onset, whereas in &quot;toast-rack&quot; the second is in many dialects reduced to the unreleased allophone it takes in syllable codas, or even elided: → ; likewise &quot;nitrate&quot; → with a voiceless (and for some people an affricated &quot;tr&quot; as in &quot;tree&quot;), vs &quot;night-rate&quot; → with a voiced . Cues of syllable boundaries include aspiration of syllable onsets and (in the US) flapping of coda &quot;(a tease&quot; → vs. &quot;at ease&quot; → ), epenthetic stops like in syllable codas (&quot;fence&quot; → but &quot;inside&quot; → ), and r-colored vowels when the is in the coda vs. labialization when it is in the onset &quot;(key-ring&quot; → but &quot;fearing&quot; → ).

====Onset====
The following can occur as the onset:
Notes:

=====Other onsets=====

Certain English onsets appear only in contractions: e.g. (&quot;&#x27;sblood&quot;), and or (&quot;&#x27;swounds&quot; or &quot;&#x27;dswounds&quot;). Some, such as (&quot;pshaw&quot;), (&quot;fwoosh&quot;), or (&quot;vroom&quot;), can occur in interjections. An archaic voiceless fricative plus nasal exists, (&quot;fnese&quot;), as does an archaic (&quot;snew&quot;).

Several additional onsets occur in loan words (with varying degrees of anglicization) such as (&quot;bwana&quot;), (&quot;moiré&quot;), (&quot;noire&quot;), (&quot;zwitterion&quot;), (&quot;zwieback&quot;), (&quot;Dvorak&quot;), (&quot;kvetch&quot;), (&quot;schvartze&quot;), (&quot;Tver&quot;), (&quot;Zwickau&quot;), (&quot;Kshatriya&quot;), (&quot;&quot;), (&quot;Tlaloc&quot;), (&quot;Vladimir&quot;), (&quot;zloty&quot;), (&quot;Tskhinvali&quot;), (&quot;Hmong&quot;), (&quot;Khmer&quot;), and (&quot;Nganasan&quot;).

Some clusters of this type can be converted to regular English phonotactics by simplifying the cluster: e.g. (&quot;dziggetai&quot;), (&quot;Hrolf&quot;), (&quot;croissant&quot;), (&quot;Nguyen&quot;), (&quot;pfennig&quot;), (&quot;phthalic&quot;), (&quot;tsunami&quot;), (&quot;!kung&quot;), and (&quot;Xhosa&quot;).

Others can be replaced by native clusters differing only in voice: (&quot;sbirro&quot;), and (&quot;sgraffito&quot;).

====Nucleus====
The following can occur as the nucleus:
*All vowel sounds
*, and in certain situations (see below under word-level patterns)
* in rhotic varieties of English (e.g. General American) in certain situations (see below under word-level patterns)

====Coda====

Most (in theory, all) of the following except those that end with , , , , or can be extended with or representing the morpheme -s/-z. Similarly, most (in theory, all) of the following except those that end with or can be extended with or representing the morpheme -t/-d.

 argues that a variety of syllable codas are possible in English, even in words like &quot;entry&quot; and &quot;sundry&quot; , with being treated as affricates along the lines of . He argues that the traditional assumption that pre-vocalic consonants form a syllable with the following vowel is due to the influence of languages like French and Latin, where syllable structure is CVC.CVC regardless of stress placement. Disregarding such contentious cases, which do not occur at the ends of words, the following sequences can occur as the coda:
*Notes:

For some speakers, a fricative before is elided so that these never appear phonetically: becomes , becomes , becomes .

===Syllable-level patterns===
*Syllables may consist of a single vowel, meaning that onset and coda are not mandatory.
*The consonant does not occur in syllable-initial position (most speakers do not maintain it even in loans like &quot;Ngorongoro&quot; and &quot;Nguyen&quot;).
*The consonant does not occur in syllable-final position.
*Onset clusters ending in are followed by or its variants (see note e above).
*Long vowels and diphthongs are not found before , except for the mimetic words &quot;boing&quot; and &quot;oink&quot;, unassimilated foreign words such as Burmese &quot;aung&quot; and proper names such as &quot;Taung&quot;, and American-type pronunciations of words like &quot;strong&quot; (which have or ). The short vowels occur before only in assimilated non-native words such as &quot;ginseng&quot; and &quot;Song&quot; (name of a Chinese dynasty) or non-finally in some dialects in words like &quot;strength&quot; and &quot;length&quot; as well as in varieties without the &quot;foot&quot;-&quot;strut&quot; split.
* is rare in syllable-initial position (although in the northern half of England, is used for and is common at the start of syllables).
* Stop + before (all presently or historically ) are excluded.
* Sequences of + C1 + V̆ + C1, where C1 is a consonant other than and V̆ is a short vowel, are virtually nonexistent.

===Word-level patterns===
* does not occur in stressed syllables, unless it is merged with another vowel as in some varieties.
* does not occur in word-initial position in native English words, although it can occur syllable-initially as in &quot;luxurious&quot; in American English, and at the start of borrowed words such as &quot;genre&quot;.
*, , and, in rhotic varieties, can be the syllable nucleus (i.e. a syllabic consonant) in an unstressed syllable following another consonant, especially , , or . Such syllables are often analyzed phonemically as having an underlying as the nucleus. See above under Consonants.
*The short vowels are checked vowels, in that they cannot occur without a coda in a word-final stressed syllable. (This does not apply to , which does not occur in stressed syllables as mentioned above.)

==Prosody==
The prosodic features of English – stress, rhythm, and intonation – can be described as follows.

===Prosodic stress===
Prosodic stress is extra stress given to words or syllables when they appear in certain positions in an utterance, or when they receive special emphasis.

According to Ladefoged&#x27;s analysis (as referred to under above), English normally has prosodic stress on the final stressed syllable in an intonation unit. This is said to be the origin of the distinction traditionally made at the lexical level between primary and secondary stress: when a word like &quot;admiration&quot; (traditionally transcribed as something like ) is spoken in isolation, or at the end of a sentence, the syllable &quot;ra&quot; (the final stressed syllable) is pronounced with greater force than the syllable &quot;ad&quot;, although when the word is not pronounced with this final intonation there may be no difference between the levels of stress of these two syllables.

Prosodic stress can shift for various pragmatic functions, such as focus or contrast. For instance, in the dialogue &quot;Is it brunch tomorrow? No, it&#x27;s dinner tomorrow&quot;, the extra stress shifts from the last stressed syllable of the sentence, &quot;tomorrow&quot;, to the last stressed syllable of the emphasized word, &quot;dinner.&quot;

Grammatical function words are usually prosodically unstressed, although they can acquire stress when emphasized (as in &quot;Did you find the cat? Well, I found a cat&quot;). Many English function words have distinct strong and weak pronunciations; for example, the word &quot;a&quot; in the last example is pronounced , while the more common unstressed &quot;a&quot; is pronounced . See Weak and strong forms in English.

===Rhythm===
English is claimed to be a &quot;stress-timed&quot; language. That is, stressed syllables tend to appear with a more or less regular rhythm, while non-stressed syllables are shortened to accommodate this. For example, in the sentence &quot;One make of car is better than another&quot;, the syllables &quot;one&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, &quot;bett-&quot; and &#x27; will be stressed and relatively long, while the other syllables will be considerably shorter. The theory of stress-timing predicts that each of the three unstressed syllables in between &quot;bett-&quot; and &#x27; will be shorter than the syllable &quot;of&quot; between &quot;make&quot; and &quot;car&quot;, because three syllables must fit into the same amount of time as that available for &quot;of&quot;. However, it should not be assumed that all varieties of English are stress-timed in this way. The English spoken in the West Indies, in Africa and in India are probably better characterized as syllable-timed, though the lack of an agreed scientific test for categorizing an accent or language as stress-timed or syllable-timed may lead one to doubt the value of such a characterization.

===Intonation===
Phonological contrasts in intonation can be said to be found in three different and independent domains. In the work of Halliday the following names are proposed:

*&quot;Tonality&quot; for the distribution of continuous speech into tone groups.
*&quot;Tonicity&quot; for the placing of the principal accent on a particular syllable of a word, making it the &quot;tonic syllable&quot;. This is the domain also referred to as prosodic stress or sentence stress.
*&quot;Tone&quot; for the choice of pitch movement on the tonic syllable. (The use of the term &quot;tone&quot; in this sense should not be confused with the tone of tone languages, such as Chinese.)

These terms (&quot;the Three Ts&quot;) have been used in more recent work, though they have been criticized for being difficult to remember. American systems such as ToBI also identify contrasts involving boundaries between intonation phrases (Halliday&#x27;s &quot;tonality&quot;), placement of pitch accent (&quot;tonicity&quot;), and choice of tone or tones associated with the pitch accent (&quot;tone&quot;).

Example of phonological contrast involving placement of intonation unit boundaries (boundary marked by comma):
Example of phonological contrast involving placement of tonic syllable (marked by capital letters):
Example of phonological contrast (British English) involving choice of tone (\ = falling tone, \/ = fall-rise tone)
There is typically a contrast involving tone between wh-questions and yes/no questions, the former having a falling tone (e.g. &quot;Where did you \PUT it?&quot;) and the latter a rising tone (e.g. &quot;Are you going /OUT?&quot;), though studies of spontaneous speech have shown frequent exceptions to this rule. Tag questions asking for information are said to carry rising tones (e.g. &quot;They are coming on Tuesday, /AREN&#x27;T they?&quot;) while those asking for confirmation have falling tone (e.g. &quot;Your name&#x27;s John, \ISN&#x27;T it.&quot;).

==History of English pronunciation==
The pronunciation system of English has undergone many changes throughout the history of the language, from the phonological system of Old English, to that of Middle English, through to that of the present day. Variation between dialects has always been significant. Former pronunciations of many words are reflected in their spellings, as English orthography has generally not kept pace with phonological changes since the Middle English period.

The English consonant system has been relatively stable over time, although a number of significant changes have occurred. Examples include the loss (in most dialects) of the and sounds still reflected by the in words like &quot;night&quot; and &quot;taught&quot;, and the splitting of voiced and voiceless allophones of fricatives into separate phonemes (such as the two different phonemes represented by). There have also been many changes in consonant clusters, mostly reductions, for instance those that produced the usual modern pronunciations of such letter combinations as , and .

The development of vowels has been much more complex. One of the most notable series of changes is that known as the Great Vowel Shift, which began around the late 14th century. Here the and in words like &quot;price&quot; and &quot;mouth&quot; became diphthongized, and other long vowels became higher: became (as in &quot;meet&quot;), became and later (as in &quot;name&quot;), became (as in &quot;goose&quot;), and became and later (in RP now ; as in &quot;bone&quot;). These shifts are responsible for the modern pronunciations of many written vowel combinations, including those involving a silent final.

Many other changes in vowels have taken place over the centuries (see the separate articles on the low back, high back and high front vowels, short A, and diphthongs). These various changes mean that many words that formerly rhymed (and may be expected to rhyme based on their spelling) no longer do. For example, in Shakespeare&#x27;s time, following the Great Vowel Shift, &quot;food&quot;, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;blood&quot; all had the vowel , but in modern pronunciation &quot;good&quot; has been shortened to , while &quot;blood&quot; has been shortened and lowered to in most accents. In other cases, words that were formerly distinct have come to be pronounced the same – examples of such mergers include &quot;meet–meat&quot;, &quot;pane–pain&quot; and &quot;toe–tow&quot;.

==Controversial issues==
===Velar nasal===
The phonemic status of the velar nasal consonant is disputed; one analysis claims that the only nasal phonemes in English are and , while is an allophone of found before velar consonants. Evidence in support of this analysis is found in accents of the north-west Midlands of England where is found only before or , with &quot;sung&quot; being pronounced as . However, in most other accents of English &quot;sung&quot; is pronounced , producing a three-way phonemic contrast &quot;sum&quot; – &quot;sun&quot; – &quot;sung&quot; and supporting the analysis of the phonemic status of . In support of treating the velar nasal as an allophone of , claims on psychological grounds that did not form part of a series of three nasal consonants: &quot;no naïve English-speaking person can be made to feel in his bones that it belongs to a single series with &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. ... It still &quot;feels&quot; like &quot;ƞg&quot;.&quot; More recent writers have indicated that analyses of as an allophone of may still have merit, even though may appear both with and without a following velar consonant; in such analyses, an underlying that is deleted by a phonological rule would account for occurrences of not followed by a velar consonant. Thus the phonemic representation of &quot;sing&quot; would be and that of &quot;singer&quot; is ; in order to reach the phonetic form and , it is necessary to apply a rule that changes to before or , then a second rule that deletes when it follows .

* 1. → / ____ velar consonant 
* 2. → ∅ / _____

These produce the following results:

However, these rules do not predict the following phonetic forms:

In the above cases, the is not deleted. The words are all single morphemes, unlike &quot;singer&quot; and &quot;singing&quot; which are composed of two morphemes, &quot;sing&quot; plus &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ing&quot;. Rule 2 can be amended to include a symbol # for a morpheme boundary (including word boundary):

2. 

This rule then applies to &quot;sing&quot;, &quot;singer&quot; and &quot;singing&quot; but not to &quot;anger&quot;, &quot;finger&quot;, or &quot;hunger&quot;.

According to this rule, the words &quot;hangar&quot; (&#x27;shed for aircraft&#x27;), which contains no internal morpheme boundary, and &quot;hanger&quot; (&#x27;object for hanging clothes&#x27;), which comprises two morphemes, are expected to constitute a minimal pair as &quot;hangar&quot; versus &quot;hanger&quot; ; in actuality, their pronunciations are not consistently distinguished in this manner, as &quot;hangar&quot; is frequently pronounced .

Additionally, there are exceptions in the form of comparative and superlative forms of adjectives, where Rule 2 must be prevented from applying. The ending &quot;-ish&quot; is another possible exception.

As a result, there is, in theory, a minimal pair consisting of &quot;longer&quot; ( &#x27;more long&#x27;) and &quot;longer&quot; ( &#x27;person who longs&#x27;), though it is doubtful that native speakers make this distinction regularly. Names of persons and places, and loanwords, are less predictable. &quot;Singapore&quot; may be pronounced with or without ; &quot;bungalow&quot; usually has ; and &quot;Inge&quot; may or may not have .

===Vowel system===
It is often stated that English has a particularly large number of vowel phonemes and that there are 20 vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, 14–16 in General American, and 20–21 in Australian English. These numbers, however, reflect just one of many possible phonological analyses. A number of &quot;biphonemic&quot; analyses have proposed that English has a basic set of short (sometimes called &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;checked&quot;) vowels, each of which can be shown to be a phoneme and can be combined with another phoneme to form long vowels and diphthongs. One of these biphonemic analyses asserts that diphthongs and long vowels may be interpreted as comprising a short vowel linked to a consonant. The fullest exposition of this approach is found in , where all long vowels and diphthongs (&quot;complex nuclei&quot;) are made up of a short vowel combined with either (for which the authors use the symbol ), or (plus for rhotic accents), each thus comprising two phonemes. Using this system, the word &quot;bite&quot; would be transcribed , &quot;bout&quot; as , &quot;bar&quot; as and &quot;bra&quot; as . One attraction that the authors claim for this analysis is that it regularizes the distribution of the consonants , , and (as well as in non-rhotic accents), which would otherwise not be found in syllable-final position. suggest nine simple vowel phonemes to allow them to represent all the accents of American and British English they surveyed, symbolized (front vowels); (central vowels); and (back vowels).

The analysis from came out of a desire to build an &quot;overall system&quot; to accommodate all English dialects, with dialectal distinctions arising from differences in the ordering of phonological rules, as well as in the presence or absence of such rules. Another category of biphonemic analyses of English treats long vowels and diphthongs as conjunctions of two vowels. Such analyses, as found in or for example, are less concerned with dialectal variation. In , for example, there are seven basic vowels and these may be doubled (geminated) to represent long vowels, as shown in the table below:

Some of the short vowels may also be combined with ( &quot;bay&quot;, &quot;buy&quot;, &quot;boy&quot;), with ( , &quot;beau&quot;) or with ( &quot;peer&quot;, &quot;pair&quot;, &quot;poor&quot;). The vowel inventory of English RP in MacCarthy&#x27;s system therefore totals only seven phonemes. (Analyses such as these could also posit six vowel phonemes, if the vowel of the final syllable in &quot;comma&quot; is considered to be an unstressed allophone of that of &quot;strut&quot;.) These seven vowels might be symbolized , , , , , and . Six or seven vowels is a figure that would put English much closer to the average number of vowel phonemes in other languages.

A radically different approach to the English vowel system was proposed by Chomsky and Halle. Their &quot;Sound Pattern of English&quot; proposed that English has lax and tense vowel phonemes, which are operated on by a complex set of phonological rules to transform underlying phonological forms into surface phonetic representations. This generative analysis is not easily comparable with conventional analyses, but the total number of vowel phonemes proposed falls well short of the figure of 20 often claimed as the number of English vowel phonemes.

<doc id="947776" wikidata="Q1189608" url="?curid=947776" title="Campaign for Homosexual Equality">
<text>The Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) was a membership organisation in the United Kingdom with a stated aim from 1969 to promote legal and social equality for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals in England and Wales. Active throughout the 1970s and becoming a mass-membership organisation during this time CHE&#x27;s membership declined in the 1980s.

CHE set up a research trust in 2021 to &#x27;advance education for the public benefit about the history of the struggle for LGBT+ rights, including but not limited to the origins and history of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality and by contributing to the safe preservation of LGBT+ archives&#x27;. The CHE Research Trust (CHERT) was registered as a charity on 11 March 2022. 

==History==
CHE began in Manchester as the North-Western Homosexual Law Reform Committee in 1964 as a local branch of the Homosexual Law Reform Society. An initial meeting was held on 4 June 1964, but only about eight people attended. A decision was made to re-establish the group on a wider basis, and an &quot;advisory group&quot; formed. This group chose the name &quot;North-Western Homosexual Law Reform Committee&quot;. The new group was launched at Church House, Deansgate, Manchester, on 7 October 1964. Allan Horsfall was its secretary and most visible member. In 1969, the NWHLRC was renamed the Committee for Homosexual Equality with aims to becoming a national body for England and Wales. The group met at the Swarthmoor Centre in Leeds in 1971 and, later in the same year, changed its name to the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE). 

London Friend was set up in London in 1972 intended to provide counselling. In 1972, CHE members took part in the first London Pride at Hyde Park, followed by a march to Trafalgar Square, nominally to protest at the age of consent, then age 21. That year, CHE had become the largest lesbian and gay rights organisation in the country, representing a more reformist goal than the liberationist Gay Liberation Front. By 1973, it held the first national gay rights conference in Morecambe. In this period, CHE claimed 5,000 members and some 100 local groups. 

In 1974, CHE appeared alongside London Friend in a documentary titled &quot;Speak for Yourself&quot; produced by London Weekend Television. At this time, the organisation&#x27;s offices were at 22 Great Windmill Street, London. The offices of London Friend were at 47 Church St, London NW8. The organisations worked closely together through social events. CHE at the time had 4000 members and was involved in campaigns and politics, whereas Friend was a counselling service. It organised a national Homosexual Equality Rally in London. The rally was supported by the women&#x27;s movement and people from ethnic minorities. Where earlier actions had concentrated on legal protection from criminal persecution, this rally was part of gay and lesbian people starting to establish a distinct sexual identity. Those who turned out for the rally did so to support the extension of constitutional rights and universal values to lesbian and gay people. CHE and London Friend shared offices and had close links until 1974. Friend was separated from CHE in 1975. 

In May 1974, CHE’s Working Party on Law Reform proposed lowering the age of consent to sixteen, or twelve in some legal cases. At the time 200-300 youth, mostly young men between 16-20 years old, were being prosecuted for consensual homosexual acts every year. After internal review, in 1973, the idea of twelve for age of consent was dropped. In 1972, there was movement by heterosexual activists to make their age of consent fourteen. In 1977, CHE passed a resolution at its conference, “supported by the vast majority of delegates”, which condemned press harassment of the Paedophile Information Exchange. 

At a fringe meeting of the organisation held in Coventry in 1978, a new separate international organisation was formed, named ILGA, which later became International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.

In 1979, its offices were moved from Manchester to London. In the 1980s, the group campaigned for further law reform and on issues such as Section 28. That decade, the CHE decided to focus on campaigning and diverted its attention away from local groups; this led to a loss in membership during the decade.

In 2005, the organisation received a substantial bequest from a former member, Derek Oyston of Gateshead. In early 2009, the organisation was campaigning to prevent cases of historic child sex abuse being prosecuted if raised more than five years after the young person gained age of majority; this, alongside issues relating to CHE&#x27;s membership, &quot;governance, constitution, electoral process policy-making process [and] financial transparency&quot; led to its being disaffiliated from Liberty.

Lord Smith of Finsbury became a vice-president of CHE in February 2009. In 2010, the organisation commissioned a book titled &quot;Amiable Warriors: A Space to Breathe, 1954 - 1973&quot;, by Peter Scott-Presland to write their own account of the organisation&#x27;s history. 

The organisation received the 2014 Alan Turing Memorial Award as part of the Homo Heroes Awards ceremony organised by the Lesbian and Gay Foundation. From 2015, the organisation has stated on its page that it &quot;no longer has the resources to offer assistance to individuals experiencing discrimination, whether in the UK or elsewhere.&quot;

<text>Narvacan, officially the Municipality of Narvacan (; ), is a municipality in the province of Ilocos Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 46,234 people.

==History==
A Spanish expeditionary force sent from Vigan by the military officer and navigator, Captain Juan de Salcedo was shipwrecked along the town&#x27;s coast in 1576. When they were being rescued by the natives, the Spaniards asked the natives what the name of their place was. The resident&#x27;s leader replied in an Ilocano dialect by asking the Spaniards, &quot;Nalbakan?&quot; (Are you shipwrecked?). The Spaniards thought this to be the answer to their question, and from then, the place was referred to as Narvacan.

Salcedo befriended the small tribe of indigenous peoples in the valley that resided in the area while Spanish families established a township in 1576. As part of the modern township, a Roman Catholic parish was established by the Augustinian religious order on 25 April 1587. The Narvacan parish became one of the first Roman Catholic parishes in present-day Ilocos Sur. Once dedicated to Saint Lucy, it was rededicated in 2017 to the patronage of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, leaving Saint Lucy as its secondary patron.

The parish church boasts a facade of baroque architecture, with a bell tower situated on the right side of the church and a cemetery on the left. A school, the Narvacan Catholic School, is situated beside the bell tower of Narvacan.

Narvacan was organized under the traditions of the royal government of Spain. The Habsburg royal family served as the heads of state which in turn appointed Santiago de Vera as President of the &quot;Royal Audiencia&quot; – governor of the region in which Narvacan was situated. In 1589, Governor Vera appointed Nicolas de Figueroa as the first &quot;Encomendero de Narvacan&quot; – principal administrator of the town and its neighbors in the encomienda system. His role eventually evolved into the office of alcalde.

Through Presidential Proclamation No. 684, October 23, 2024 was declared a special non-working day to commemorate the &quot;Aldaw Ti Wayawaya-lli A Narvacan&quot;.

<doc id="947782" wikidata="Q48287" url="?curid=947782" title="Krivichs">
<text>The Krivichs or Kryvichs (; , ) were a tribal union of Early East Slavs between the 6th and the 12th centuries. It is suggested that originally the Krivichi were native to the area around Pskov. They migrated to the mostly Finnic areas in the upper reaches of the Volga, Dnieper, Dvina, areas south of the lower reaches of river Velikaya and parts of the Neman basin.

==Etymology==
According to Max Vasmer, the name of the tribe probably stems from that of their legendary forefather Kriv. The article in the encyclopedia &quot;&quot; clarifies that this interpretation comes from East Slavic mythology. Vasmer also mentions that the tribe was mentioned by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in his &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; as .

Jan Stankievič believed it was derived from the adjective &quot;kroŭ&quot;/&quot;kryvi&quot; (&quot;blood&quot;), hence, &quot;kryvič&quot; would mean &quot;blood relative&quot;.

==History==

The Krivichs left many archaeological monuments, such as the remnants of agricultural settlements with traces of ironworks, jeweler&#x27;s art, blacksmith&#x27;s work and other handicrafts; long burial mounds of the 6th to 9th centuries with cremated bodies; burial mounds of rich warriors with weapons; sets of distinctive jewelry (bracelet-like temporal rings and glass beads made out of stretched wire). By the end of the first millennium, the Krivichs had already acquired well-developed farming and cattle-breeding. Having settled around the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, the Krivichs traded with the Varangians. Their chief tribal centres were Gnezdovo, Izborsk, and Polotsk.

The Krivichs as a tribe took part in Oleg&#x27;s and Igor&#x27;s military campaigns against the Byzantine Empire.

==Modern uses of the name==
* Today, in Latvian, means &quot;Russian&quot; and is &quot;Russia&quot;. Through Baltic territories, the word became known in Central Europe. For example, a German chronicler from Duisburg wrote in 1314: &quot;&quot;. And in a Polish publication (Lublin, 1687. Б. II, 49) the Polotsk saint Paraxedis was called (the queen of the Kryvians).
* Also in Latvian, a Belarusian is known as , and Belarus is named . The prefix &quot;balt-&quot; is from the Latvian word which means &quot;white&quot;, thus is cognate to &quot;White Russia&quot; and &quot;Belarus&quot; itself.
* () was the name of a magazine that the Belarusian historian Vaclau Lastouski published in Kaunas from 1923 to 1927.
* Kriwi is the name of a Belarusian folk-rock band.
* Places named Kryvičy in modern Belarus are possibly named after the tribe, however this is contested basing on the suggested areal of Krivichs.

<text>Ottawa University (OU) is a private Baptist university with its main campus in Ottawa, Kansas. It also has a second residential campus in Surprise, Arizona, and adult campuses in the Kansas City and Milwaukee metropolitan areas, as well as online. It was founded in 1865 and is affiliated with the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma and the American Baptist Churches USA. The residential campus in Ottawa has a student enrollment of more than 875 students, while the OUAZ campus in Surprise has more than 900. In total, Ottawa University serves more than 4,000 students across all of its campuses and online.

==History==
The origins of Ottawa University date back to the 1860s when Baptist missionaries established the First Baptist Church in the area that would eventually develop into Ottawa. It was predominately occupied by Potawatomi and Odawa peoples. Elsewhere, Kansas Baptists had chartered an institute of higher learning that they were planning to call &quot;Roger Williams University&quot; after Roger Williams, the founder of the First Baptist Church in America. They were seeking an appropriate site. 

At the 1860 Baptist State Convention in Atchison, Kansas, Rev. John Tecumseh &quot;Tauy&quot; Jones (Chippewa) made a case for the university to be founded in Ottawa. He proposed that the Baptists work with Native Americans in the area, who might be willing to sell some of their land in order to create a college. Jones was an interpreter and influential among tribal leaders.

After discussions with Native American leaderswho were amenable to the idea the parties agreed that 20,000 acres of land would be set aside for the express purpose of constructing a college. On August 20, 1862, the first board of trustees (made up of four Native Americans and two white Baptists) met and decided to purchase 5,000 acres of the aforementioned land so as to establish a campus. In 1865, the board decommissioned the name &quot;Roger Williams University&quot; and adopted &quot;Ottawa University&quot; to replace it. Eventually, the campus was whittled to about 640 acres. 

Rev. Isaac Smith Kalloch, a Baptist minister from New England, served as the first president from 1866 to 1868. He oversaw the construction of Tauy Jones Hall, which is the oldest surviving building on campus.

==Campuses==


The original campus, founded in 1865, is in Ottawa, Kansas. It is referred to as OU.

<text>Larry Phillip Fontaine, (born September 20, 1944) is an Indigenous Canadian leader and former National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations. He best known for his central role in raising public awareness of the Canadian Indian residential school system and pushing to secure Federal and Papal apologies in 2008 and 2022 respectively. He also helped secure a repudiation of Discovery doctrine from Pope Francis on March 30, 2023.

==Early life==
Fontaine, an Ojibwe, was born September 20, 1944 to Jean Baptiste Fontaine and Agnes Mary Spence at the Sagkeeng First Nation on the Fort Alexander Reserve in Manitoba, about 150 kilometers north of Winnipeg. There were twelve children in the family, ten boys and two girls. His father died in 1952, and his mother in 1988. His first language is Ojibway.

In his youth he attended a residential school operated by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate at Sagkeeng. He also attended the Assiniboia Residential School in Winnipeg and he graduated from Powerview Collegiate in 1961.

In 1973, Fontaine was elected Chief of the Sagkeeng community for two consecutive terms. Upon completion of his mandate, he and his family moved to the Yukon, where he was a regional director general with the Canadian government.

==Political career==
In 1981 Fontaine graduated from the University of Manitoba with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political studies. After graduation, he worked for the Southeast Resource Development Council as a special advisor to the tribal council, which was followed by his election to the position of Manitoba’s vice-chief for the Assembly of First Nations. Fontaine was one of the Manitoba First Nation leaders who led the opposition of the Meech Lake Accord.

The Aboriginal Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission credits Fontaine for placing the issue of residential schools on the national agenda when in October 1990 he spoke publicly about the abuse that he and his fellow students had experienced at the Fort Alexander school. The next year, in 1991, he was elected grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and served for three consecutive terms.

In 1997 he was elected national chief of the Assembly of First Nations for the first time. Following his first term as national chief, Fontaine was appointed chief commissioner of the Indian Claims Commission. Under his term the land claim of the Kahkewistahaw First Nation was resolved, resulting in a $94.6 million agreement for the Saskatchewan band. Fontaine resigned from the ICC in 2003 in order to run for national chief once again.

In July 2003, Fontaine was elected to his second term as national chief of the Assembly of First Nations. He ran again and was re-elected in July 2006 with almost 76 percent of the vote, defeating Bill Wilson of British Columbia. He was re-elected in 2006 on the basis of the &quot;Getting Results&quot; agenda, which proved to be successful. In his third term, Fontaine said that he would attempt to bring the $5 billion Kelowna Accord negotiated in 2005 with the Liberal government of Paul Martin back to the table. The deal, aimed at improving living conditions and education for Aboriginal people, was cancelled by the succeeding Conservative government.

In 2005, Fontaine successfully negotiated the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, which will mean a financial contribution of more than $5 billion to survivors and programs for them. The IRSSA, which includes a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, was ratified by the federal Conservative government in May, 2006.

In June, 2007, Fontaine, Prime Minister Harper, and Indian Affairs Minister Jim Prentice announced a process to establish an independent tribunal to adjudicate Specific Land Claims.

Fontaine has two children, Mike and Maya (May-a), and seven grandchildren. His nephew Jerry Fontaine served as chief of the Sagkeeng Nation from 1989 to 1998, and was a prominent Aboriginal leader in Manitoba. Another nephew is Tim Fontaine, a former journalist and now comedy writer who created the satirical &quot;Walking Eagle News&quot; in 2017. 

In 2005, he was recognized as number one of the Top 50 list of Capital People of 2005 selected by Ottawa Life Magazine.

In 2009, he had a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in order to obtain an apology for abuses that occurred in First Nations schools during the 20th century.

Since September 1, 2009, Fontaine acts as &quot;Special Advisor&quot; to the Royal Bank of Canada. His mandate is to &quot;provide advice and counsel to RBC&#x27;s Canadian businesses to help the company deepen its relationships with Aboriginal governments, communities, and businesses in Canada&quot;.

On March 29, 2010, Fontaine joined Norton Rose OR LLP (formerly Ogilvy Renault) as Senior Advisor and advises Canadian and international clients with First Nations matters, including Aboriginal law, energy, environmental and mining and resources.

He was made an officer of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2012.

In 2014, he was heckled by a group of Indigenous protestors at the University of Winnipeg due to his support for the Trans Mountain pipeline

<text>The Lamian War, or the Hellenic War, (323–322 BC) was an unsuccessful attempt by Athens and a large coalition of Greek states to end the hegemony of Macedonia over Greece just after the death of Alexander the Great. It was the last time Athens played a significant role as an independent power.

War was simmering in Greece after Alexander the Great issued the Exiles&#x27; Decree (in 324 BC), which ordered the Greek states to return all the people they had forced into exile. This decree meant that Athens had to surrender the island of Samos, colonised by Athenian clerurchs since 365 BC, while the Aetolian League had to leave Oiniadai, taken c.330 BC. Once the death of Alexander became known in June 323 BC, most states in mainland Greece revolted and founded the Hellenic League, recalling the alliance forged during the Persian Wars; this time with Macedonia in the role of the foreign invader. The Greeks were initially successful under their Athenian commander in chief Leosthenes, who managed to besiege Antipater, the Macedonian general in Europe, in the city of Lamia, which gave its name to the war. At this point however, the arrival of a large Macedonian fleet commanded by Cleitus the White from the Levant turned the tide in favour of Macedonia. Even though Athens had more ships than Macedonia, it did not have enough crews to man them all and its overextended navy was defeated off the Echinades island and Amorgos.

On land, the Greeks lifted the siege of Lamia with the arrival of Macedonian reinforcements from Asia. At the head of a large merged army, Antipater defeated the Greeks in Thessaly at the battle of Krannon, after which he received the surrender of every city state in central Greece. Faced with the prospect of a naval blockade and a land invasion, Athens capitulated. It had to give up its navy, host a Macedonian garrison on its soil, lose its possessions outside Attica, and even trade its democracy for an oligarchic regime. As a symbol of the event, the famous orator Demosthenes committed suicide to avoid his capture by the Macedonians. Athens never played a leading role again in Greece after the Lamian War.

While Antipater was turning his forces west to deal with the Aetolian League, the last member of the Greek alliance still fighting, he was called back to Asia by the beginning of the Wars of the Diadochi between Alexander&#x27;s generals. The Aetolian League therefore escaped unscathed and appear to be the real winner of the war, because Athens bore most of the fight, and the league remained mostly in place. The Aetolian League then became one of the most important states in Greece during the Hellenistic era.

== Sources and name of the war ==

=== Sources ===
The main ancient source on the Lamian War is the Greek historian Diodorus of Sicily, who composed a very large work, the &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, at the very end of the Roman Republic. The events of the war are detailed in books 17–18. Modern historians have been very critical of Diodorus, for his careless treatment of chronology, inability to deal with conflicting sources, insertions of his own opinions as facts, omission of entire years of events, etc. Diodorus is nevertheless useful because his work preserves fragments of lost historians. His books dealing with the Lamian War drew extensively on Hieronymus of Cardia, the main historian of the beginning of the Hellenistic era, who also played a historical role and met many of the generals of Alexander the Great.

Plutarch, a Greek moralist who lived at the time of the Flavian emperors and Trajan, is also a good source thanks to his biographies of Demosthenes and Phocion, two leading politicians in Athens at the time.

=== Name ===
The initial name of the war was the Hellenic War, mostly labelled as such in epigraphic material of the end of the 4th century and beginning of the 3rd century. It was chosen by the Greeks in order to recall their victorious war against the Persian Empire in the first half of the 5th century, thus placing Macedonia in the role of Persia. The name of their coalition, the Hellenic League, was chosen for the same reason. In his biography of Phocion, Plutarch writes &quot;Hellenic War&quot;, because his source was Duris of Samos, who wrote a history book of the period in the 270s, at a time when it was still the common name. The name shift to &quot;Lamian War&quot; happened with Hieronymus of Cardia, who wrote an influential book just a decade after Duris. He was a pro-Macedonian writer who wanted to avoid using the name &quot;Hellenic War&quot; that was too much directed against Macedonia. Hieronymus&#x27; Macedonian bias can be retrieved from Diodorus&#x27; writings, as he mostly based his account from Hieronymus, and as a result has a negative tone towards the Greeks and their attempt to recover their freedom. Moreover, Hieronymus wrote his book after the Chremonidean War (267–261), another unsuccessful revolt of the Greeks against Macedonia, and likewise wished to avoid any reminder of the Persian Wars.

This theory was first made by N. G. Ashton in 1984 and has found general acceptance since. However, in 2011, John Walsh has suggested that the name Lamian War was first coined by the poet Choerilus of Iasus, who composed an epic named &quot;Lamiaka&quot; about the war soon after the events. It means that Choerilus had identified the siege of Lamia as the turning point of the war. Walsh notes that such epics became fashionable during the Hellenistic era and that Choerilus might have been a member of the court of Antipater, the Macedonian regent in Europe, also a man of letters. Therefore, Hieronumus would have only popularised a term that already existed.

== Background ==
In 338 BC, the Macedonian king Philip II defeated a coalition of Greek states led by Thebes and Athens at the battle of Chaeronea. He then forced the Greeks into an hegemonic alliance called the League of Corinth in order to secure his back while he started a war of conquest against the Persian empire, but resentment remained high among the Greeks. In 335 Thebes revolted at the news that the new Macedonian king Alexander III had died, but he acted quickly and razed Thebes to the ground. Four years later, the Spartan king Agis III led another war of liberation against Macedonia, which was defeated by Antipater at the battle of Megalopolis. At the same time, a new federal state in central Greece called the Aetolian League took advantage of Agis&#x27; revolt to capture the city of Oiniadai, which was repopulated with Aetolians. In 324, Alexander completed his conquests in Asia and moved to Mesopotamia, where he proclaimed the Exiles&#x27; Decree, which demanded that citizens forced into exile in any Greek city had to be allowed to return to their home. Read at the Olympic Games on 4 August 324 BC before a crowd of 20,000 exiles, the Exiles&#x27; Decree caused a lot of tension in Greece, especially in Athens, which had colonised the island of Samos for several decades and did not want to abandon this valuable possession. The Aetolian League was also ordered to withdraw from Oiniadai; Alexander threatened to come in person to punish the Aetolians.

Athens was already preparing for war when the news of Alexander&#x27;s death in June 323 BC became known; war started shortly after, probably in the beginning of September. Two Athenian politicians are known to have advised against the war: Phocion and Demades, who represented the interests of the landed aristocracy. The latter lost his political rights because of his support of Macedonia, and especially for having sponsored the bill that gave Alexander the Great the status of a god. A friend of Antipater, Aristotle was also condemned on a spurious charge of impiety, and left Athens for Chalcis in Euboea.

Before his death, Alexander had wanted to settle his Greek mercenaries in Persis, but many of them (in the tens of thousands) returned to Greece before that could happen. They escaped through a fleet raised by an Athenian mercenary named Leosthenes, who brought them to the Greek mainland. Secretly in touch with his native city, Leosthenes kept about 8,000 of these mercenaries with him in Cape Taenarum (a mercenary market on Spartan territory) and carved an alliance with the Aetolians, waiting for the right moment to go to war against Macedonia. The life of Leosthenes before the Lamian War has long been debated by scholars, who describe him as having served either Alexander or Darius, then acting as either a private mercenary leader or a strategos (an elected magistrate at Athens). John Walsh also suggests that Leosthenes&#x27; achievements were exaggerated by the ancient historian Diodorus of Sicily.

=== Belligerents ===
Athens was able to receive the support of many Greek states, principally in northern and central Greece. These states had likely been approached during the Nemean Games that took place in summer 323, where representatives of most city-states gathered. The Aetolian League was the most natural ally, as its members were equally concerned by the Exiles&#x27; Decree. The alliance was possibly concluded in mid-September 323 BC. Other allies from the area joined successively in this chronological order: Thessaly except Pelinna, Oetaea except Heraklea, Achaea Phthiotis except Phthiotic Thebes, Malis except Lamia, Doris, Locris, Phokis, Ainis, Alyzeia, Dolopia, Athamania, the island of Leukas in the Ionian Sea, some of the Molossians in Epirus. Alliances were also concluded further north with some Illyrian and Thracian tribes. N. G. L. Hammond also mentions that the Odrysian king Seuthes III was at war with Macedonia at the same time, but does not connect this revolt to the Lamian War. 

In the Peloponnese, Argos, Sicyon, the Acte peninsula including Epidaurus and Troezen, Phlius, Elis, and Messenia joined the Hellenic League. These cities followed Athens at a later date than the northern cities, as the treaty between Athens and Phokis is dated from 27 October, while that with Sicyon is from 23 December. It showed that Athens&#x27; diplomatic effort continued over several months after the beginning of the war.

Sparta refused to join, mainly because of their losses during the War of Agis III, but also because the war was led by Athens, which had refused to support Agis. In addition, Sparta did not want to join an alliance that counted its traditional enemies Argos and Messenia. Several leading Spartans were also held hostages by Macedonia in Asia. Kleonai rejected the alliance with Athens, despite its earlier diplomatic overture during the Nemean Games nearby. Arcadian states remained neutral, likewise because of their losses during the War of Agis. Although the Arcadians were initially pro-Macedonian, it is possible that Demosthenes convinced them to withdraw from their alliance with Macedonia while he was in exile in Troezen. Rewarded for his diplomatic help in the Peloponnese, Demosthenes was recalled to Athens during the winter of 323–322 BC.

The Hellenic League had much less success in the Aegean Sea, as only Rhodes and Carystus (on the southern tip of Euboea) answered favourably. The other islanders probably felt more threatened by the imperialism of Athens than that of Macedonia, and were more sympathetic to the cause of Samos, still occupied by Athens. Although Rhodes expelled its Macedonian garrison at the same time as the war, it might not have joined the Hellenic League.

Nevertheless, very few states in Greece remained loyal to Macedonia, apart from the Euboean League, still resentful at Athens for its recent interventions in the island, and Boeotia. After the destruction of Thebes in 335 BC, its territory was shared between the other Boeotian cities, which now feared that Athens would restore it. Acarnania still supported Macedonia, because of Oiniadai, which had been taken by the Aetolian League. For an unknown reason, the Acarnanian city of Alyzeia sided alone with the Hellenic League.

Macedonia also had garrisons in the acropoleis of Thebes (Cadmea) and Corinth (Acrocorinth). The occupation of the Acrocorinth ensured the neutrality of Corinth and also prevented the Peloponnesian states from joining their armies with that of northern states, as it blocked the Isthmus. Ioanna Kralli notes that apart Sicyon, &quot;the Peloponnesian participants demonstrated lack of commitment&quot; during the war as a result.

=== Early Athenian successes (autumn 323 BC) ===
Once the war became official, Athens sent 50 talents to Leosthenes to pay his mercenaries and the allied Greeks made him &quot;General of the Greeks&quot;. From Taenarum, he moved to Aetolia, where he received the command of 7,000 Aetolians, then to Boeotia in order to join his troops with that of Athens, which had sent 5,000 hoplites, 2,000 mercenaries, and 500 cavalry. Leosthenes defeated an army of Boeotians, Euboeans, and Macedonians (the garrison from the Cadmea), near Plataea. This early success won the adhesion of most other states of central Greece. With an army of about 30,000 men, Leosthenes moved to the north and defended the Thermopylae pass, while waiting for the Macedonian response.

In order to prevent the revolt from spreading to Thessaly, Antipater moved south with the Macedonian army of 13,000 hoplites and 600 cavalry, while his navy of 110 triremes followed him with supplies along the coast. In Thessaly, he recruited about 2,000 cavalry, then advanced towards the Greek army at the Thermopylae. However, the Thessalian cavalry betrayed Antipater and destroyed his Macedonian cavalry in the process. Antipater managed to turn back with his phalanx still intact and entered in Lamia (15km north of the Thermopylae), the only city of the area that had remained faithful to Macedonia. He barricaded there and waited for the reinforcements to come from Asia. N. G. L. Hammond called Antipater&#x27;s decision &quot;brilliant&quot;: it forced the Greeks to lay a difficult siege on Lamia as they could not invade Macedonia while letting such a large Macedonian force in their back. Antipater nonetheless suffered the first Macedonian defeat on Greek soil in 30 years, ever since the Third Sacred War.

At the same time, the Athenian strategos Phaidros led an expedition that destroyed the Euboean city of Styra, which belonged to Eretria. Euboean cities were on the Macedonian side, except Karystos, which northern border was near Styra, and was likely helped by Athens against its neighbour. The goal of the expedition was perhaps to intimidate the Euboean cities, or the price demanded by Karystos for its alliance with Athens.

=== The war at sea ===
At the start of the war, Athens had a massive navy of more than 410 warships: 360 triremes, 50 quadriremes, and 7 quinqueremes. It could nevertheless only man about 200 ships; a number that still outnumbered the available Macedonian fleet in the Aegean Sea. Initially, Antipater could only rely on the 110 ships that had escorted the treasure Alexander sent with Harpalus. However, in 322 BC, the situation was reversed with the decisive arrival of the Macedonian admiral Cleitus the White, at the head of a large navy of 240 ships. These ships came from a navy of 1,000 vessels commissioned by Alexander before he died. Although Alexander&#x27;s grandiose plans were abandoned after his death, some of the ships had already been built in the Levant.

In a short passage, Diodorus Siculus, the main source of the Lamian War, tells that Cleitus the White defeated the Athenian admiral Euetion in two battles off some islands called the Echinades. This passage has been widely discussed among modern scholars. In 1924, T. Walek set the standard view for the rest of the 20th century, that the Echinades islands cannot be those located off Acarnania in the Ionian Sea, but some islands in the Malian Gulf off the city of Echinus, not far from Lamia where Antipater was still besieged. In 2001, Brian Bosworth rejected Walek&#x27;s view, and instead considered that Diodorus must be correct, as the Echinades islands are just off the city of Oiniadai, which was the city captured by the Aetolian League c.330 BC and one of the main causes of the war. Bosworth&#x27;s theory has since shifted the majority view towards his explanation of the events.

The Macedonian fleet commanded by Cleitus must have passed through the Diolkos to sail that fast to Acarnania. Corinth and the Diolkos had remained firmly under Macedonian control thanks to the very strong fortress of the Acrocorinth nearby. The Macedonian navy was likely supporting a land offensive of the Acarnanians towards Oiniadai in an operation to retake this city from the Aetolian League. It would explain why the Aetolians suddenly left the siege of Lamia to return home. Grainger supposes it was to hold their elections, but Bosworth suggests that the Aetolians had to defend their territory attacked by the Acarnanians in late 323 BC. The two victories of Cleitus against Euetion apparently resulted in the evacuation of Oiniadai by the Aetolians, because in the next mention in the sources, this city was in Acarnanian hands. This side of the conflict prevented the Aetolians from helping the other Greeks against Antipater, as they were missing from the remaining battles of the war.

The defeats off the Echinades island had not been decisive, and the Athenians still had several hundreds of ships. However, in the attempt to match the number of Macedonian ships, they overextended their limited amount of rowers, and their ships were undermanned. The Athenian war effort was still considerable as the sailors must been about 30,000, a number not seen since the invasion of Greece by Xerxes in 480. In the late summer 322 BC, the largest battle of the Lamian war took place off the island of Amorgos in the Cyclades, located not far from Samos, as Cleitus was by now challenging the Athenian hold of this island. Undermanned and outnumbered, the Athenian navy was soundly defeated.

Another Athenian defeat might have taken place near the Hellespont (now called the Dardanelles), as Athens had to bring corn supplies from the Black Sea through these narrow straights, which shores were controlled by Macedonia.

At an unknown date, an Athenian army commanded by Phocion repelled an amphibious Macedonian raid led by Mikion on the town of Rhamnous in Attica. This raid had possibly been launched from Chalcis while the Athenian navy was away.

=== Macedonian counter-offensive on land ===
Antipater remained besieged in Lamia for most of the winter 323–322 BC, but he did not stay inactive. The Macedonian army made sorties, during one of which Leosthenes was killed, perhaps by a slinger. Antipater waited for reinforcement from Lysimachus, the Macedonian commander in Thrace, but he was too facing a revolt from Seuthes, king of the Odrysians. He also requested help from Leonnatus, who was in Phrygia, and Craterus in Cilicia, whom Antipater also promised the hand of two of his available daughters; likely Eurydice for Leonnatus and Phila for Craterus. Leonnatus was the first to arrive; he could cross the Hellespont after the Athenian navy was defeated there. His help was not disinterested, as he intended to marry Cleopatra, the sister of Alexander, who had offered herself in marriage to him with the support of Alexander&#x27;s mother, Olympias, who disliked Antipater. With such strong and symbolic supports, Leonnatus coveted the Macedonian throne.

Leonnatus had an army of 20,000 foot soldiers and 1,500 cavalry. He arrived in Thessaly in early Spring 322 BC, but did not coordinate with Antipater. The new commander of the Greeks Antiphilus lifted the siege of Lamia to fight Leonnatus. The following battle was only fought between the respective cavalries, of whom the very strong Thessalian cavalry commanded by Menon of Pharsalus (also appointed commander of the Greeks) had the upper hand and even killed Leonnatus, but the Macedonian hoplites could retreat on higher grounds. The location of the battle is not known; Yardley places it was at Melitaea, in the north of Lamia, while Hammond just mentions &quot;the open plain of Thessaly&quot;, and Westlake suggests it was &quot;perhaps in the south of the Pelasgiotid plain&quot;.

This Greek victory nevertheless allowed Antipater to escape from Lamia while the Greek army had left to fight Leonnatus (whose death suited Antipater as he lost a dangerous rival). Antipater merged his army with that of Leonnatus and that of Craterus, who had just arrived from Cilicia with 10,000 hoplites (including 6,000 veterans), 1,500 cavalry, and 1,000 Persian archers and slingers. Antipater thus commanded a very large army of 40,000 soldiers, 3,000 archers and slingers, and 5,000 cavalry, which was much bigger than the 25,000 hoplites and 3,500 horses of Antiphilus. The final battle took place at Crannon on 6 August 322 BC. Although the Thessalian cavalry had the upper hand in the horse battle, the Greek infantry was pushed back and disengaged. Casualties were limited, with 500 dead for the Greeks (including 200 Athenians) and 130 for the Macedonians, but the outcome was decisive enough to compel the Athenians and their allies to sue for peace.

Brian Bosworth suggests that initially, the Macedonian armies commanded by Antipater and Leonnatus were mostly composed of Asian levies and mercenaries. It is only with the arrival of Craterus with his army only made of Macedonians soldiers that the Greeks lost their momentum on land.

The generals of the Greek Antiphilus and Menon first wished to negotiate for the entire alliance, but Antipater only wanted to deal with each city individually. He then conquered Thessalian cities one by one, which made all the Greek states apart from Athens and the Aetolians to surrender individually. Greek states thereafter competed with each other to have the best terms possible from Antipater. 

==Aftermath==

=== Athens&#x27; punishment ===

Once Antipater reached Boeotia, Athens sought for peace. The Athenian delegation to Antipater was composed of Demades and Phocion, the two leading politician who had spoken against the war with Macedonia, as well as Xenocrates of Chalcedon, the head of Plato&#x27;s Academy. Antipater demanded the installation of a Macedonian garrison in the fortress of Munychia in the harbour of Piraeus, which was thus taken on 18 September 322 BC.

Antipater also requested the extradition of the Athenian leaders who had pushed for the war against Macedonia. Demades carried the subsequent motion in the ecclesia sentencing to death these leaders, of whom the most prominent included Demosthenes, Hypereides, and Eucrates, who were hunted by Macedonian henchmen throughout Greece. Hypereides was murdered in Kleonai on 6 October 322 BC, while Demosthenes committed suicide one week later. Anti-Macedonian leaders suffered from the same fate in other Greek cities, such as Euphron of Sicyon.

The constitution of Athens was altered so that only citizens with properties worth more than 2,000 drachmas retained their political rights. The citizen body therefore decreased from 21,000 to 9,000. This amendment was likely suggested by Demades and Phocion themselves, but opposed by Xenocrates. Upon his return, the latter refused to be granted the Athenian citizenship as he did not want to become part of a regime he rejected.

Finally, Athens lost the city of Oropus and the sanctuary of the Amphiareion on its northern border, which had been given by Philip from Thebes in 338 BC after the battle of Chaeronea. Antipater carefully avoided dealing with Samos, and referred the matter to Perdiccas, who &quot;de facto&quot; controlled the empire after the death of Alexander. Perdiccas nevertheless upheld Alexander&#x27;s will and demanded Athens to evacuate Samos. The cleruchs of Samos had to return to Athens, among whom was notably the young Epicurus.

The war was a catastrophe for the economy of Athens. Most building programs were stopped and the marble and metal industries died out in the city, which also suffered from famine at the beginning of the 3rd century.

==Historiography==

Ancient authors often severely judged the Greeks for having started the Lamian War. Although born in Athens, the 3rd century AD historian Dexippus considered that it was irrational for Athens to attack the many times more powerful empire of Alexander. He also criticised the Athenians for their arrogance even after their defeat at Crannon.

The 19th-century radical politician and historian George Grote considered the outcome of the Lamian War a calamitous tragedy, marking the extinction of an &quot;autonomous Hellenic world&quot;. On his account, it extinguished free speech in Greece and dispersed the Athenian Demos to distant lands. Nevertheless, the war, in spite of its disastrous result, was a &quot;glorious effort for the recovery of Grecian liberty, undertaken under circumstances which promised a fair chance of success.&quot;

<text>Vivian Hsu (; ; born March 19, 1975) is a Taiwanese actress, model, and singer. In 1990, at 15, she won first place in a talent show in Taiwan and formed Girl&#x27;s Team (1991–1993). At 19, she moved her career to Japan, where she became active on variety shows and formed the band Black Biscuits. In 1998, she performed on Japan&#x27;s NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen. Since 2003, she has refocused her career in Greater China.

==Early life==
The second of three children, Hsu was born to a Hakka father and Tayal Taiwanese mother as Hsu Su-chuan (), and used this name until she began her modeling career. Her parents divorced when she was a young child. She attended Taichung Jianxing Elementary School and Taipei Shulinguo Junior High School.

==Career==
Hsu&#x27;s career started after winning first place in a &quot;Talented Beautiful Girl&quot; contest held by Taiwan&#x27;s CTS in 1990. At that point, she was working by delivering food on her bicycle, and her customers began to recognise her from her television appearances. The same year she joined a musical trio named &quot;Girls&#x27; Team&quot; (少女隊). They released two albums, in 1991 and 1992, then broke up. Following this, Hsu started modeling.

===Modelling===
As a model, she posed in two photobooks titled &quot;Angel&quot; (天使心) and &quot;Venus&quot;. &quot;Angel&quot;, published in 1995, was shot in Capri and Sicily. &quot;Venus&quot;, published on July 7, 1996, was shot in Mexico and had separate runs in Taiwan and Japan.

Hsu&#x27;s success in modeling achieved its zenith in July 1996 when she was featured on the cover of two biography (the Japanese edition, and the comparatively low-distribution Hong Kong edition). Like the photobooks, both these items have become very sought after by collectors and fans.

Hsu has continued to model for designers such as Hang Ten, Gucci and Mode Marie, and has modelled in all three of her brief, autobiographical books: &quot;Earth Onigiri&quot; (2001), &quot;Privacy&quot; (2001, ), and &quot;Wo Ai Taiwan&quot; (2002). In addition, most of her musical albums contain substantial inserts featuring new modelling work.

===Acting===
Hsu has appeared in a number of films and television programs both in China and Japan. She appeared in the ambitious 2006 mainland China-Taiwan-Hong Kong collaboration &quot;The Knot&quot;, a romance film that takes place between the CCP&#x27;s takeover of mainland China and the present. Her debut film was &quot;Shaolin Popey&quot; (1994), a comedy film which became a box office hit in Taiwan and Hong Kong. She also has some experience as a voice actress, having voiced Aisha in &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; for three episodes.

Hsu also starred in three Hong Kong Category III motion pictures, &quot;Hunting List&quot;, &quot;Devil Angel&quot; and &quot;Angel Heart&quot;. She appeared in the 2001 film &quot;The Accidental Spy&quot;, with Jackie Chan. She played the role of Chao Jiale in &quot;Love Storm&quot; (2003), alongside Vic Chou and Ken Chu. She also composed and sang the opening theme for this series, &quot;Decide to Love You&quot; (決定愛你), which was released as a single in 2003. As with many actors and actresses, she appears from time to time in commercials and as spokesperson for various causes. In 2006, Hsu played a role in the film &quot;The Shoe Fairy of Do Do&quot;, a modern fairy tale.

Since 2010 she has appeared in television commercials for the aesthetic salon Slim Beauty House, and Kao&#x27;s &quot;Essential&quot; hair care brand line as one of its three newfaces along with Yuriko Yoshitaka and Nozomi Sasaki.

===Music===
Hsu released her first solo single in 1995. She released her first full-length album, &quot;Tianshi Xiang&quot; (天使想) in Japanese in 1996. Shortly thereafter, she took a crash course in Korean, and released a Korean version of the album titled &quot;Cheonsa Misonyeo&quot; (天使美少女). Unusually, neither of Hsu&#x27;s first two albums was sung in her native language.

In 1997, with two Japanese comedians—Kyoya Nanami and Amazan—and later with a second female vocalist known as Keddy, she joined the musical act Black Biscuits. The group was formed primarily as a &quot;rival band&quot; for the Japanese music group Pocket Biscuits, which was the creation of the Japanese variety show &quot;Utchan Nanchan no UriNari&quot;. Between 1997 and 1999, they released four hit singles and a full-length album, &quot;Life&quot;. Their single CD &quot;Timing&quot; recorded 1.5 million sales in 1998. They participated in Kōhaku Uta Gassen in 1998. Towards the end of the group&#x27;s run, they failed to accomplish one of the challenges set forth by the variety show and the resulting punishment was the disbanding of Black Biscuits. 

During this period, Hsu also released two more solo albums: &quot;Da Mafan&quot; (大麻煩) in 1998, and &quot;Bubai de Lianren&quot; (不敗の戀人) in 1999. She followed &quot;Bubai de Lianren&quot; with a Japanese translation, &quot;Fuhai no Koibito&quot;, in 2000. Later that same year she released another new album, &quot;Jiaban de Tianshi&quot; (假扮的天使).

In 2001, she formed The d.e.p with Masahide Sakuma, Gota Yashiki, Masami Tsuchiya and Mick Karn. The band was short-lived: by the end of the year they had released all the music they ever would. This amounted to two singles and a full-length album, &quot;地球的病気 -We Are the d.e.p-&quot;. 

Over the next two years, she released a few more singles, including, alongside Kazuma Endo of Siam Shade, &quot;Moment&quot;, the second opening theme to &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, followed in 2003 by her next solo album, &quot;The Secret to Happiness Is Love&quot;. Her last album is &quot;Hen Hen Ai&quot; (狠狠愛), released in April 2005. Her most recent album is &quot;Vivi and...&quot;, released in September 2006. For this album, Hsu collaborated with many artists and people including Jay Chou, Wang Leehom, Gary Cao, Nicky Lee and even her little brother and uncle.

Hsu returned to Japan after a seven-year absence to release her new single &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; on March 3, 2010. 

Apart from being a singer, Hsu is also a lyricist, noted for her collaboration with Jay Chou. She also wrote for Leehom Wang, Vanness Wu, Show Lo and Gigi Leung.

== Personal life==
In January 2014, Hsu got engaged to Singaporean businessman Sean Lee of Marco Polo Marine Limited. They held a wedding ceremony in Bali, Indonesia on June 26. Hsu announced her pregnancy in March 2015 via Facebook calling the pregnancy a &quot;surprise&quot; and &quot;heaven sent&quot; and said it came at a time when the self-professed workaholic promised to clear her work schedule in 2015 to focus on starting a family. On August 13, 2015, she gave birth to a boy, Dalton. The couple divorced on 10 December 2023, nine years after their marriage.

<text>Sand is an archaeological site on the Applecross Peninsula in Wester Ross, Scotland.

Sand is the site of a major archaeological excavation on the Inner Sound coast of the Applecross Peninsula in Western Scotland, to the north of the small town of Applecross.

A small number of shell middens were known as rare traces of Mesolithic settlement when a rock shelter and shell midden at Sand, Applecross on the coast of Wester Ross, Scotland, was selected for detailed excavation as part of a study of shell middens in the area around the &quot;Inner Sound&quot; between the Skye and the mainland.

The &quot;Scotland’s First Settlers&quot; project (SFS) investigating the relationship of early inhabitants with the western seaboard chose this area which had known sites at An Corran in Staffin, Skye, and at Redpoint and Shieldaig in Torridon. Their surveys in 1999 and 2000 found 104 previously unknown sites, mostly caves and rock shelters with 21 &quot;lithic scatters&quot; and 9 open shell middens. A proportion of these sites will be more recent, but test pits at 4 sites found &quot;Loch a Sguirr&quot; on Raasay and &quot;Sand&quot; in &quot;Applecross&quot; to be Mesolithic. The indication is that there are many more surviving sites than had been expected.

The rock shelter site at Sand on the Applecross peninsula, just to the north of Applecross itself, faces out across the Inner Sound westwards towards Skye and Raasay. Around 7,500 years BCE the first users of the rock shelter had worked antler and stone to make tools. As well as using local stone for their tools they had obtained distinctive stone from the island of Rùm, to the south, and Staffin on Skye, to the west, showing that they were able to cross open sea.

Gradually a large pile of shells, mainly limpets, built up into a large midden. Abundant fragments of stone &quot;pot-boilers&quot; and bevel ended bone tools indicate that the shellfish were being cooked and the contents scooped out. There were also bones from red deer and birds and an antler harpoon for catching a wide range of fish, including cod, mackerel, haddock, herring and salmon.

Fine beads had been made from seashells, while ochre pigment and a particular species of dog whelk that may have been used for the extraction of purple dye suggest concern with decoration.

==Naval base==
There is a British Naval Base at Sand that monitors underwater activity around this part of the west coast. The BUTEC establishment tests marine weapons. Submarines can often be seen in the waters between Applecross Peninsula and Raasay.

<text>Rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The event was summarised under the &quot;Football&quot; heading along with association football. The host Great Britain was represented by Cornwall, the 1908 county champion. Defending Olympic champions France withdrew, leaving Australasia, (represented in rugby by the Australia national team exclusively) as the only other remaining entrant.

== History ==

The visiting team competed in the London Olympics in conjunction with the inaugural Australia tour of the United Kingdom of 1908-09, in which they would ultimately go 25-5-1 (win, draw, lose) in their 31 matches. The Australian team entered the rugby tournament and were the only other team alongside Cornwall (who were representing Great Britain).

Australia had already beaten Cornwall, the English county champions early in the tour – an 18–5 defeat of Cornwall in their third tour match at Camborne RFC on 3 October 1908. Both Scotland and Ireland had declined the Rugby Football Union&#x27;s invitations to participate in the Olympic competition, while France withdrew, leaving just the Australian and Great Britain to play for gold and silver medals. 

The interest in the Olympic rugby final was only lukewarm, with the final being held in the last week of the Games, that had taken place over six months.
In 1908 Twickenham Stadium was still being built: the match was played at the White City Stadium, London, on an area alongside the Olympic Games swimming pool, which measured 110 yards in length with a long line of netting stretched beside to catch flying balls. Large mattresses were spread along the rim of the pool to prevent injuries to falling players. One day was allocated to the Olympic rugby tournament, with the game taking place in a thick mid-week London fog at a virtually deserted White City in wet conditions. Often, a kick for touch saw the ball end up in the pool, and it was said that the Australians were more adept at handling the slippery ball.

Penzance RFC and England international winger Barrie Bennetts had to withdraw with an injury in the morning and was replaced by Barney Solomon – the elder brother of the much more famous Bert. Cornwall had five current or future England players – captain John Jackett of Falmouth at full back, Bert Solomon at centre, England and British Lions fly-half John &quot;Maffer&quot; Davey at fly half who partnered St Ives and England scrum half, Tommy Wedge. The pack which scrummaged on a first up/first down principle in those days included another England man A J Wilson who was a student at Camborne School of Mines.
Australia outscored Great Britain six tries to one to win the gold medal by 32-3. Silver was awarded to Cornwall and no bronze was awarded. The Cornish silver olympic medal was &#x27;drawn for&#x27; by the players and won by Thomas &#x27;Chicky&#x27; Wedge and it has been on display at the St Ives RFC clubhouse ever since. After the match, the Cornish players were &#x27;entertained to dinner&#x27; by the Cornish Members of Parliament.

Zavos quotes a contemporary newspaper account by Major Trevor in The Daily Telegraph on 27 October, 1908, &quot;It will be remembered that less than a month ago there was a match played between Australia and Cornwall at Camborne and although the Australians also won on that occasion, the beaten side then played on the whole, a very good game. Yesterday the champion England county was practically at full strength, but from start to finish they were outplayed. The methods by which this victory was gained were even more creditable to the winners than the completeness of the victory itself and it is only fair to the Australians to speak of their play in terms of unqualified praise. The ground was very slippery and very heavy and as a result of several hours of continuous rain the ball was very greasy. The excellence of the play of the Australian backs therefore surprised the spectators. They gave a display of football which would have done credit to a Welsh international side, at its best. They scored eight tries and so good was the play leading up to each of them that it would be hard to say which was the best.&quot;

==Centenary celebration match==
As part of the centenary celebrations, the British Olympic Association arranged a match between Australia and the Barbarians which was held at Wembley Stadium on 3 December 2008. The Barbarian players, who normally wear their club socks, all wore gold and black socks to represent Cornwall, in a game which Australia won 11-8.

<text>John William Donahey (August 26, 1905 – March 2, 1967) was an American businessman, government official, and politician from Ohio. A Democrat, he was most notable for his service as the 53rd lieutenant governor of Ohio from 1959 to 1963.

A native of New Philadelphia, Ohio, and the son of Governor and U.S. Senator A. Victor Donahey, John Donahey attended Ohio State University and Cleveland College, and supplemented his education with professional development courses through the American Institute of Banking.

During his father&#x27;s governorship, Donahey served as a clerk in the governor&#x27;s office. In 1930, he married Gertrude Walton, who served as a senior staff member for U.S. Senator Stephen M. Young and as Ohio State Treasurer. From 1933 to 1951, Donahey was employed as a loan examiner with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

In 1952, Donahey was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Senator. In 1954 and 1956, he ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer. In 1958, he was the successful Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor and he served from 1959 to 1963. In 1962, Donahey was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for state auditor. After leaving office, Donahey worked as the Small Business Administration&#x27;s regional director for Ohio.

Donahey died at Grant Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, on March 5, 1967, after he suffered a heart attack while recovering from surgery. He was buried at East Avenue Cemetery in New Philadelphia.

==Early life==
Donahey was born in New Philadelphia, Ohio, on August 26, 1905, a son of A. Victor Donahey and Mary (Harvey) Donahey. He was educated in the public schools of Columbus and New Philadelphia and was a 1926 graduate of New Philadelphia High School.

As a teenager and young man, Donahey worked at a variety of temporary jobs, including an assembly line job at an Overland Automobile factory in Toledo, and crew member on a lighthouse tender that provided maintenance to facilities on the coast of Central America. After high school, Donahey attended Ohio State University and Cleveland College, the adult education campus of Western Reserve University. He later took professional development courses through the American Institute of Banking.

==Start of career==
During his father&#x27;s term as governor, Donahey served as the commission clerk in the governor&#x27;s office. He subsequently worked as a field supervisor for the Motorists’ Mutual Insurance Company of Columbus and the Donahey Insurance Agency. Donahey married Gertrude Walton in 1930. She was a longtime senior staff member for U.S. Senator Stephen M. Young, then served twelve years (1971-1983) as Ohio State Treasurer. They were the parents of a son, John W. Donahey Jr. (1935-2006).

In 1933, Donahey joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, where he worked as a loan examiner until 1951. After leaving the RFC, Donahey was the founder and president of Poco Corporation. Poco was a venture which conducted research and experimentation to identify new industrial, food, and farming uses for surplus grain.

==Political career==
A Democrat in politics, Donahey was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Senator in 1952. He ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer in 1954 and again in 1956.

In 1958, Donahey ran successfully for lieutenant governor. He served one term, 1959 to 1963. As lieutenant governor, Donahey prioritized economy and low taxes, and set an example by returning to the state treasury part of the budget for his office at the end of each fiscal year.

In 1962, Donahey was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for state auditor. After leaving office, Donahey worked as the Small Business Administration&#x27;s regional director for Ohio.

==Death and burial==
In February 1967, Donahey was admitted to Grant Hospital in Columbus, where he underwent surgery. During his post-surgery recovery, Donahey suffered a fatal heart attack, and he died on March 2. Donahey was buried at East Avenue Cemetery in New Philadelphia.

<text>The 28th Infantry Division (&quot;Keystone&quot;) is a unit of the United States Army National Guard, and is the oldest division-sized unit in the Army. Some of the units of the division can trace their lineage to Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s battalion, The Pennsylvania Associators (1747–1777). The division was officially established in 1879 and was later redesignated as the 28th Division in 1917, after the entry of America into the First World War. It is today part of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, Maryland Army National Guard, Ohio Army National Guard, and New Jersey Army National Guard.

It was originally nicknamed the &quot;Keystone Division,&quot; as it was formed from units of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard; Pennsylvania being known as the &quot;Keystone State.&quot; During World War II, it was given the nickname the &quot;Bloody Bucket&quot; division by German forces due to the shape and color of its red keystone insignia. Today the 28th Infantry Division goes by the name given to it by General Pershing during World War I: &quot;Iron Division.&quot; The 28th is the first Army National Guard division to field the Stryker infantry fighting vehicle, as part of the Army&#x27;s reorganization in the first decade of the 2000s.

The 28th is also one of the most decorated infantry divisions in the United States Army.

==Creation==
On 12 March 1879, Governor Henry Hoyt signed General Order Number One appointing Maj. Gen. John F. Hartranft as the first Division commander of the National Guard of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was the first state to structure its National Guard units at such a high tactical level in peacetime. From 11 to 18 August 1894, Camp Samuel W. Crawford was the &quot;Division Encampment at Gettysburg&quot;.

The division was mustered into federal service for the Spanish–American War in 1898. Pennsylvania initially levied 10,800 men, in ten infantry regiments and four artillery batteries. The entire division was mustered into federal service between 6 May and 22 July, and while 8,900 men had assembled at Mount Gretna for the muster parade on 28 April 1898, there was no difficulty in raising 12,000 men for service in two and a half months. However, only the 4th, 10th, and 16th Regiments, three artillery batteries, and three cavalry troops were deployed, to Puerto Rico. The 10th Regiment was then sent to the Philippines, being ordered home on 30 June 1899.

The division was called up to respond to labor disturbances in 1877 and 1900.

In 1914 the division was designated the 7th Division as part of a broad reorganization of the National Guard. On 29 June 1916, the 7th Division was mustered into federal service at Mount Gretna and deployed to El Paso, Texas, to serve along the Mexican border as the Regular Punitive Expedition entered Mexico. Major General Charles M. Clement commanded, directing the First Brigade comprising the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments, the Second Brigade the 10th, 16th, and 18th Regiments, and the Third Brigade the 4th, 6th, and 8th Regiments. There was also a regiment of cavalry and one of artillery, plus two companies of signals troops and medical units. The camp outside El Paso gained the title &#x27;Camp Stewart&#x27; after the Adjutant General, Thomas J. Stewart. On 19 September, one brigade was sent home. On 14 November, the 1st Artillery left for home; the 18th Infantry left for Pennsylvania on 18 December, and the remainder of the division between 2–19 January 1917. It appears that most of the division was mustered out of federal service on 23 February 1917 at Philadelphia.

The remnant left on the border included the 8th and 13th Regiments, the newly formed 3rd Artillery and Company C of the Engineers. They were released from active service in March 1917. However, the call-up process for World War I was underway as these units left the border. The 13th Regiment began its return home from Texas on 21 March 1917, but en route were told that their mustering-out orders had been rescinded.

==World War I==
===Federalization===
The division moved to Camp Hancock, Georgia, in April 1917, the same month of the American entry into World War I, and was there when the entire division was drafted into federal service on 5 August 1917. From May to 11 October 1917, the division was reorganized into the two-brigade, four-regiment scheme, also known as a square division, and thus became the 28th Division.

The Turner Publishing account says that:

The situation for the division at Camp Hancock was dismal. The men arrived there in summer uniforms, which were not replaced by winter ones until the winter was well along. Adequate blankets were not available until January. Training equipment was woeful. There was but one bayonet for each three men; machine guns made of wood; and there was but one 37-mm gun for the whole division.


In March 1918, several thousand National Army men sent from Camp Lee, Virginia, Camp George G. Meade, Maryland, and Camp Travis, Texas, were assigned to replace losses and complete the division.

===Overseas service===
By May 1918, after several months of training, the division had arrived in Europe, and began training with the British. On 14 July, ahead of an expected German offensive, the division was moving forward, with most of it committed to the second line of defense south of the Marne River and east of Château-Thierry. As the division took up defensive positions, the Germans commenced their attack, which became the Battle of Chateau-Thierry, with a fierce artillery bombardment. When the German assault collided with the main force of the 28th, the fighting became bitter hand-to-hand combat. The 28th repelled the German forces and decisively defeated their enemy. However, four isolated companies of the 109th and 110th Infantry stationed on the first defensive line suffered heavy losses. After the battle, General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force, visited the battlefield and declared that the 28th soldiers were &quot;Men of Iron&quot; and named the 28th ID as his &quot;Iron Division.&quot; The 28th developed a red keystone-shaped shoulder patch, officially adopted on 27 October 1918.

During World War I, the division was involved in the Meuse-Argonne, Champagne-Marne, Aisne-Marne including the Battle of Fismes and Fismette, Oise-Aisne, and Ypres-Lys (FA) operations. During the war, it took a total of 14,139 casualties (2,165 killed and 11,974 wounded). Two individuals received the Medal of Honor: Sergeant James I. Mestrovitch, Company C, 111th Infantry; and Major Joseph H. Thompson, Headquarters, 110th Infantry. Edwin Martin wrote about the history of the division during World War I can be found in his book &quot;The Twenty-Eighth Division: Pennsylvania&#x27;s Guard in the World War&quot;.

==Interwar period==

The 28th Division headquarters arrived at the Port of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, aboard the USS &quot;Kroonland&quot; on 30 April 1919 after twelve months of overseas service and was demobilized on 17 May 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey. In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the division was allotted to the state of Pennsylvania and assigned to the III Corps in 1921. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized on 22 December 1921 at Philadelphia. The headquarters was relocated on 12 March 1933 to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The designated mobilization training center for the “Keystone” Division was Camp Bullis, Texas. An honor battalion of Pennsylvania National Guardsmen of the &quot;Iron Division&quot; dedicated the in Varennes-en-Argonne, France, in 1928. The division, less the 53rd Field Artillery Brigade, conducted summer camp most years at Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania, 1922–34, and at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania, 1935–39. The 53rd Field Artillery Brigade conducted its training most years at Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania, so that its subordinate batteries could conduct live-fire training at the ranges located there. Generally, the division staff conducted command post exercises (CPXs) and staff training concurrent with the camps. The division staff also participated in the Third Corps Area CPX 6–19 July 1930 at Camp George G. Meade, Maryland; in the First Army CPXs in July of 1931 and 1934 held at Camp Dix; and the army-level CPX at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, in August 1936. For the 1935 camp, the division participated in the Third Corps Area phase of the First Army maneuvers at Indiantown Gap. During that maneuver, the 28th Division operated as part of the provisional III Corps. The “Keystone” Division also participated in the First Army maneuvers in 1939 and 1940 held at Plattsburg and Canton, New York, respectively. In both maneuvers, the 28th Division again operated as part of the provisional III Corps. In addition to the summer training, the entire division was called up for flood relief duty in March and April 1936 when Pennsylvania rivers overflowed in one of the worst floods in state history. The division was relieved from the III Corps on 30 December 1940 and assigned to the II Corps.

* Major General Edward C. Shannon (23 March 1933–24 June 1939)
* Major General Edward Martin (26 June 1939–27 January 1942)

==World War II==

===Federalization===

The division, commanded by Major General Edward Martin, was called into federal service on 17 February 1941 during World War II, although the U.S. was not involved in the conflict at that point. Instead of Camp Bullis, the division traveled to Indiantown Gap for organization and training. In February 1942, the division, now commanded by Major General James Ord, was reorganized; the brigade headquarters were disbanded, and the 111th Infantry Regiment was detached from the 28th and reorganized as a separate regimental combat team, initially used to guard important Eastern Seaboard industrial facilities under the Eastern Defense Command.

===Overseas===
The division, now under Major General Lloyd Brown, left the United States and went overseas on 8 October 1943, arriving in South Wales soon afterwards, where it began training for the invasion of Northern France. On 22 July 1944, the division landed in Normandy, seven weeks after the initial D-Day landings and was almost immediately involved in Operation Cobra.

The 28th Infantry Division pushed east towards the French capital of Paris through the Bocage, its roads littered with abandoned tanks and bloated, stinking corpses of men and animals. In little more than a month after landing at the Normandy beachhead, as part of the Allied invasion of Normandy, the men of the 28th entered Paris and were given the honor of marching down the Champs-Elysées on 29 August 1944 in the hastily arranged Liberation of Paris.

After enjoying a brief respite, absorbing replacements of men and equipment, the division, now commanded by Brigadier General Norman Cota, formerly the Assistant Division Commander (ADC) of the 29th Infantry Division, headed to the German defensive Westwall.

A small night patrol of the 109th Infantry began the division&#x27;s protracted struggle on the Siegfried Line on the dragon&#x27;s teeth infested Westwall. The patrol crossed the Our River by bridge from Weiswampach, Luxembourg into Sevenig (Our), Germany, making it the first of the Allied armies to reach German soil. The 28th suffered extremely heavy casualties that autumn in the costly and ill-conceived Battle of Hürtgen Forest (19 September to 16 December 1944); the divisional history conceded &quot;the division accomplished little&quot; in the battle. The campaign was the longest continuous battle the U.S. Army fought in World War II. Finally, a tenuous line along the Our River and Sauer River was held at the end of November, only to be abruptly broken by two panzer divisions, three infantry divisions and one parachute division (including the 352nd Infantry Division and the 5th Parachute Division) in an infantry-tank attack on the &quot;Ridge Road&quot; just west of the Our River on 16 December.

The Ardennes Offensive was launched along the entire divisional front by the 5th Panzer Army led by General der Panzertruppe Hasso von Manteuffel. The 28th, which had sustained heavy casualties in the First Army drive to the Roer, fought doggedly in place using all available personnel and threw off the enemy timetable before withdrawing to Neufchâteau on 22 December for reorganization, as its units had been badly mauled.

At the end of November 1944 a German &quot;pocket&quot; of resistance formed in the French Alsace region centered in the city of Colmar. The Colmar Pocket consisted of a strength of eight German divisions and a brigade of Panzer tanks. Combined forces of French and American armies were initially unsuccessful in closing this pocket.

General Dwight D. &quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander on the Western Front, called the Colmar Pocket &quot;a sore&quot; on the 6th Army Group&#x27;s front. The 6th Army Group was commanded by Lieutenant General Jacob Devers. The French First Army commander, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and Devers met on 11 January 1945 and agreed it was long since time to drive the Germans back out of France. Two days later, de Lattre and Devers made a request to Eisenhower for reinforcements so their armies could make an offensive on the Colmar Pocket. Eisenhower&#x27;s aide, Major General Walter Bedell Smith, subsequently told Devers that the 10th Armored Division and the 28th were being placed under his command. Smith also warned Devers that, after three months of intense fighting on the Siegfried Line as well as fighting off the initial thrust of the offensive, the 28th—put back into action in a defensive position along the Meuse River from Givet to Verdun on 2 January 1945—was &quot;capable of only limited offensive action.&quot;

Battle plans were soon made and, on 19 January, the 28th went into action on the northwestern section of the pocket in the Kaysersberg Valley supporting the beleaguered 3rd Infantry Division, which had been holding there since late November 1944. Despite the bitterly cold conditions, the Allies prevailed. German intelligence knew nothing about the 10th and 28th presence in their sector until they attacked. The 28th advanced westward and pressed steadily toward the city of Colmar. In less than 10 days they reduced the pocket by half and Adolf Hitler gave the order in the early morning of 29 January for a partial retreat of his troops in the northern sector of the pocket. By 2 February, the 28th had cleared Colmar&#x27;s surrounding areas and the French 5th Armored Division led the way into the town. On 9 February, the final organized German troops in Alsace were pushed back across the Rhine.

The 109th Infantry Regiment received the French Croix de guerre from Charles de Gaulle.

The division was on the front line for 196 days of combat. Francis J. Clark was awarded the Medal of Honor; and 29 Distinguished Service Crosses ; 1 DSM; 435 Silver Stars; 27 Legion of Merit; SM - 21; Bronze Star Medal 2,312; AM - 100 were awarded. The division returned to the United States on 2 August 1945 and was inactivated there on 13 December 1945.

===Medal of Honor===
Technical Sergeant Francis J. Clark, U.S. Army, Company K, 109th Infantry Regiment received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Siegfried Line Campaign on 12 September 1944.

===Desertion===
Edward Donald Slovik (18 February 1920 – 31 January 1945) was a private in the 109th Infantry Regiment during World War II and the only American soldier to be executed for cowardice since the American Civil War. Although over 21,000 soldiers were given varying sentences for desertion during World War II, including 49 death sentences, Slovik&#x27;s was the only death sentence carried out.

==Post World War II service==
After being inactivated as part of the Army on 13 December 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, the 28th Infantry Division was reorganized on 20 November 1946 and returned to the Pennsylvania Army National Guard at Harrisburg.

The 28th was ordered into active federal service on 5 September 1950 at Harrisburg following the outbreak of the Korean War. The division re-opened the mothballed Camp Atterbury, Indiana and remained there from 13 September 1950 to 23 November 1951. It was sent to Germany to augment NATO forces there. During the Korean War, the 28th was mobilized and deployed to Europe as a part of the NATO command defending Western Europe from the threat of Soviet attack and remained in federal service until 22 May 1954.

On 1 June 1959, the division was reorganized under the Pentomic structures. It consisted from that point of 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, 103rd Armor, 28th Signal Battalion, 28th Aviation Battalion, 1 BG-109 Inf, 1 BG-110 Inf, 1 BG-111 Inf, 2 BG-111 Inf, 1 BG-112 Inf, 1st Battalion, 107th Field Artillery Regiment (1-107 FA), 1-108 FA (Honest John), 1-109 FA, 2-109 FA, 1-166 FA, 1-229 FA, other combat and combat support units, and combat service support units, for strength of 10,408, according to Divisional Strength reports of 5 June 1959.

The division was not mobilized during the Vietnam War, although in 1965 it was selected as one of three divisions in the Army Selective Reserve Force. Nor was it mobilized in force for Operation Desert Storm in 1991; however, the 121st Transportation Company, one of its constituent units, served in Saudi Arabia and volunteers from the division were deployed overseas, some in the Middle East.

In 1996, after the signing of the Dayton Agreement, some units of the divisional artillery were called up to serve as peacekeeping forces in Bosnia; elements of the 28th served in Bosnia as peacekeepers for several years following this. In 2002, the 28th Division took command of the Northern Brigade Task Force (Task Force Eagle), as part of the NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia as part of SFOR 12. The leading combat arms units under the 28th while in Bosnia were the 109th Infantry and the 104th Cavalry. The division was the third reserve component division headquarters to take on this role in Bosnia (previously the Army National Guard&#x27;s 49th and 29th Divisions had commanded Task Force Eagle).

==21st century==

In 2003, the 28th Division again led KFOR, the NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, as part of KFOR 5A for a 9-month rotation. The 28th was the first reserve component division headquarters to take on this role in Kosovo. Later in 2005, elements of the 28th Division would again return to Kosovo as part of KFOR&#x27;s KFOR 6B rotation, the first year-long rotation by U.S. troops to the region.

During the Global War on Terror following the September 11th, 2001 attacks on the US, the Keystone Division has provided troops for Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle and several thousand troops for Operation Iraqi Freedom.

D Troop 2/104th CAV, Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) was activated in January 2003 for two years. The platoon-sized element deployed to Iraq in September 2003 as a UAV platoon with elements from the Maryland National Guard. These were the first National Guard Units to fly the Shadow UAV.

Company A, 28th Signal Battalion deployed to Iraq in February 2004. Elements of the 103rd Armor Regiment and 1st Battalion, 107th Field Artillery were activated for Iraq in January 2004. Elements of 2nd Battalion, 103rd Armor, served as military police. 
The division&#x27;s 2nd Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq for a year-long rotation in July 2005. Elements of the division would again return in 2006 and revolving deployments to Iraq seem likely in the future. The 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) was deployed in 2008 to Iraq. The Combat Aviation Brigade, 28th Infantry Division deployed to Iraq in May 2009.

Operation Enduring Freedom, Sept 2009-Nov 2010 Company C, 1/110th Inf attached to TF 2nd BCT 101st (Rakkasans) served as a platoon size force protection for PRTs in Paktika, Gardez, and Khost (FOB Chapman) with support elements in FOB Salerno. On 28 Aug 2010, the platoon under 1LT Dickey repelled a Haqanni-coordinated attack at FOB Chapman.

==Operation Iraqi Freedom==
===1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry Regiment===
In September 2001, the 1st Battalion 107th Cavalry Regiment, was transferred from the 37th Brigade, 38th Infantry Division (&quot;Cyclone&quot;) (Indiana Army National Guard) to the 2nd Brigade, 28th Infantry Division with its headquarters remaining in Stow, Ohio. In October 2003, B and C Companies, and elements of Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) and Company A, of the 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry were activated at their home stations and traveled to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Stewart, Georgia, for five months of mobilization training. There they were then attached to the 1st Battalion, 150th Armor (West Virginia Army National Guard), the 1st Battalion, 252nd Armor (North Carolina Army National Guard), and Troop E, 196th Cavalry (North Carolina Army National Guard) respectively, for deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom II with North Carolina&#x27;s 30th Brigade Combat Team under the 1st Infantry Division. These elements of the 1st Battalion operated in Iraq from February to December 2004, serving in Kirkush, Tuz Khurmatu, Jalawla, and Baghdad. They participated in the Transition of Iraq and Iraqi Governance campaigns and returned home in late December 2004.

The battalion commander LTC Richard T. Curry and CSM Albert Whatmough along with the remaining companies continued their regular training cycle until October 2004, when the remaining companies of the 1–107th Cavalry were activated for service in Operation Iraqi Freedom III. One element of HHC 1–107th CAV was then deployed to Fort Dix, New Jersey for mobilization training and left for Kuwait in January 2005. The companies operated in Baghdad, Iraq and performed detainee operations at Camps Cropper and Victory with a high-profile mission of guarding the deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein while he stood trial. The headquarters moved to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin and arrived in Kuwait in December 2004 and deployed to Mosul, Iraq in late December. This element included LTC Curry and CSM Whatmough who both deployed with the battalion in 2004–2005 to establish Forward Operating Base (FOB) Endurance which later became known as FOB Q-West Base Complex around 19 miles (30 Kilometers) south of Mosul, Iraq. The mission of LTC Curry and his staff was to provide command &amp; control of the base, establish the base defense operations center, provide life support functions, establish base defense security, conduct combat patrols and build the FOB from the ground up into the largest logistical hub operating in northern Iraq by the end of 2005, a mission that was accomplished prior to their departure.

The FOB Endurance/Q-West Base Complex HQ elements of the 1–107th CAV were attached to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and received the Army Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for their accomplishments. The HHC/A Convoy Security Company conducted operations throughout Iraq logging in thousands of miles with no fatalities and provided security for convoy elements. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 107th Cavalry served within the 1st Cavalry Division, 4th Infantry Division, and 3rd Infantry Division areas of operations as units of the 18th and 42nd MP Brigades. The final elements returned home from Iraq in January 2006 reuniting the battalion. Both HHC/A detachments received the U.S. Army Meritorious Unit Commendation for their service. In September 2007 the 1–107th Cavalry Regiment was transitioned, reorganized and reformed becoming the 1st Battalion, 145th Armor and transferred as a separate heavy battalion assigned to the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Ohio National Guard. Its sister unit the 2–107th Cavalry Regiment took its place in the 28th Infantry Division in 2008.

===2nd Squadron, 107th Cavalry===
Assigned to the 28th Infantry Division in September 2008, the 2nd Squadron, 107th Cavalry (Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition) during the years 2006–2010 deployed at different times Troops A, B, &amp; C in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom conducting various SECFOR and convoy escort missions.

===1st Battalion, 109th Field Artillery===
In December 2003 the 1st Battalion, 109th Field Artillery Regiment was activated and received Military Police training at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Following a month of training, the soldiers of the 109th were deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The different batteries were dispersed throughout Iraq serving as MPs. The members of the 109th returned home in February 2005. C Battery saw action in Fallujah during Operation Valiant Resolve in the spring campaign. Members of B Battery also saw combat in the area surrounding Camp Anaconda and Abu Ghraib, a military prison. Another contingent provided security for Ambassador Paul Bremer and other high-ranking State Department officials at Coalition HQ.

===2nd Battalion, 103rd Armor===
In January 2004, B and C Companies of the 2nd Battalion, 103rd Armor Regiment were activated and, with attachments from several other Pennsylvania Army National Guard units, reconfigured as military police companies and trained at Ft. Dix for deployment to Iraq. They were designated as companies of the 89th MP Brigade and left for Iraq in March 2004 within days of each other. Once in Iraq, they were assigned to some of the most sensitive missions of OIF II. Three platoons of Bravo Company (1st, 3rd and Headquarters) were attached to the Iraq Survey Group; while the 2nd and 4th Platoons served in military police operations, including area patrols and traffic control points supporting 1st Marine Division out of Camp Fallujah and eventually relocated to the Green Zone/International Zone as security escorts attached to the U.S.Navy for high-ranking Interim Iraqi government officials. Charlie Company was assigned to the HVD facility at Camp Cropper, with an entire platoon assigned solely to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The units both redeployed in March 2005.

===1st Battalion, 103rd Armor===
In June 2004, the 1st Battalion, 103rd Armor was activated at Fort Bliss, Texas and deployed to Iraq in November in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Task Force was composed of units from the K Troop 104th Cavalry, A Co. 1-111 Infantry, 1-112 Infantry, 1-103rd Armor, 1-109th Infantry, 103rd Engineers, and several Soldiers from the 116th CAV (Idaho NG). This marked the first deployment of a 28th ID combat battalion to a war zone since World War II. The battalion, now designated as a Task Force (Task Force DRAGOON), was stationed at Forward Operating Base Summerall, near Bayji. Attached initially to the 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, and then the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, the 800-man TF 1–103rd Armor, commanded by LTC Philip J. Logan, engaged in combat operations for 12 months before redeploying to the United States in November 2005. Thirteen soldiers from TF Dragoon were killed in action during combat operations in Salah Ad Din Province, a heavily Sunni Muslim area in the north part of the &quot;Sunni Triangle.&quot; For its outstanding performance during combat operations, TF 1-103rd Armor was awarded the Army Meritorious Unit Citation. 

===2nd Brigade Combat Team===
The division&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (2/28 BCT) was mobilized in January 2005. 2/28 BCT consisted of approximately 4,000 National Guardsmen from over 30 states and was commanded by COL John L. Gronski. Over 2,000 of the soldiers were from the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. Other states that contributed large units included Vermont, Utah, Michigan, Kentucky, New Jersey and Nebraska. 2/28 BCT conducted its post-mobilization training at Camp Shelby, MS. The soldiers were trained in full spectrum operations and received additional equipment.

In May 2005, 2nd Brigade soldiers trained at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA to prepare for their upcoming mission in Iraq due to start in July 2005.

In late June and early July 2005, 2nd Brigade soldiers began deploying to the Al Anbar Governorate and were under the command of the 2nd Marine Division through February 2006 and then were under command of 1st Marine Expeditionary Force Forward through June 2006.

The 2/28 BCT received a &#x27;transfer of authority&#x27; for its area of operations (AO) in central Al Anbar Province in July 2005. The area of operations was very large, but 2/28 BCT focused operations along the Euphrates River Valley from Ramadi to Al Habbaniyah, about 22 miles (35 kilometers) to the east. Ramadi was the 2/28 BCT main effort for the following reasons: 1) The capital of Al Anbar province and home to the provincial governor and government center; 2) large urban area with a population of approximately 400,000 Iraqi citizens; 3) Al-Qaeda in Iraq focused on the area. The Ramadi area was known as one of the most violent and dangerous areas in Iraq.

The mission of the 2/28 BCT was to neutralize the insurgency and develop Iraqi Security Forces within the area of operations in order to create stable and secure conditions and allow for self-governance. The BCT conducted counterinsurgency operations to kill or detain insurgents, to locate weapons caches, to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs), to engage in ongoing dialogue with community and government leaders, to recruit, train and integrate Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police, and to conduct civil affairs projects to improve sewer, water, energy, medical and school facilities.

2/28 BCT operations resulted in: 1) Millions of dollars of humanitarian assistance projects were completed; 2) Over 3,000 insurgents and terrorists were detained or killed; 3) A successful referendum election in October 2005 and a successful general election in December 2005; 4) Approximately 5,000 Iraqi soldiers trained and integrated into all operations, including transitioning area of operations to Iraqi brigades and battalions; 5) Hundreds of tons of explosives, ammunition, and weapons seized from insurgent caches; 6) over 1,000 young men of Ramadi recruited into the Iraqi Police; 7) Coalition force and Iraqi Army outposts established and areas controlled that had formerly been insurgent strongholds; 8) Over 1,100 roadside bombs discovered before they could be used against civilians, Iraqi government officials, or coalition forces and Iraqi soldiers.

2/28 BCT was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation as part of the I Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward) for the period of 28 February 2006 until the transition of authority to 1st Armored Division.

==Legacy==

===Shrine===

A shrine dedicated to the 28th Infantry Division is located on the grounds of the Pennsylvania Military Museum in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania. This site was formerly the estate of Colonel Theodore Davis Boal. In 1916, Boal formed the Boal Troop, a State College-based, horse-mounted machine gun unit of the 1st Pennsylvania Cavalry, which was accepted as a provisional unit of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. In April 1917, the Boal Troop was reconfigured as an infantry unit, Company A of the 107th Machine Gun Battalion, and deployed to France for service in World War I.

In 1919, soldiers of the Boal Troop returning from the war erected a monument on the Boal Estate dedicated to their fallen comrades. In the 1920s, other units of the 28th began erecting their own memorials, and began to refer to the area as a &quot;shrine.&quot; In 1931, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased the site, and in 1969 the Pennsylvania Military Museum was opened. By 1971, memorials to most of the units of the 28th that served in World War I had been erected, and in 1997 a World War II memorial was dedicated at this site.

Members of the 28th Infantry Division have gathered for a memorial service at the shrine every third Sunday in May since 1919. U.S. Route 322, on which the shrine is located, is named the Pennsylvania 28th Division Highway.

28th Infantry Division Song: &quot;Roll On!&quot;
By SGT Emil Raab (circa 1944)

We&#x27;re the 28th men and we&#x27;re out to fight again for the good old U.S.A.
We&#x27;re the guys who know where to strike the blow and you&#x27;ll know just why after we say:
Roll On, 28th, Roll On, set the pace, Hold the banners high and raise the cry, We&#x27;re off to victory!
Let the Keystone shine right down the line for all the world to see.
When we meet the foe we&#x27;ll let them know we&#x27;re Iron Infantry,
So Roll On, 28th, Roll On!

==In popular culture==
The 28th Infantry Division was portrayed in the 1998 HBO film &quot;When Trumpets Fade&quot;, a movie about the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.

<text>Gertrude Walton Donahey (August 4, 1908 – July 11, 2004) was an American politician of the Democratic party who served as Ohio State Treasurer from 1971 to 1983.

== Biography ==
Donahey was born in Goshen Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio. She earned her bachelor&#x27;s at Mann&#x27;s Business College in Columbus, Ohio and went to work at the Office of the Ohio Adjutant General&#x27;s Business and Finance Division. She was married to John W. Donahey, who served for a time as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. Her father-in-law, A. Victor Donahey, was a Governor of Ohio and a member of the United States Senate.

She was chosen as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1964 and 1968 and represented Ohio on the Party&#x27;s platform and resolution committee. She was hired in 1964 by U.S. Senator Stephen M. Young as his executive assistant. She ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 1976 as a &quot;favorite daughter.&quot; She wasn&#x27;t a serious candidate, but rather a placeholder for the party to control delegate votes in Ohio.

In 1970, Donahey was the first woman to be elected to a statewide executive office in Ohio, and second to Ohio Supreme Court judge Florence E. Allen, as Ohio State Treasurer. She held the position until 1983 in light of an embezzlement scandal which took $1.3 million from her office. The embezzlement was carried out in 1978 by head cashier, Elizabeth Jane Boerger and her private business associate, Robert W. Yeazell. The accounting firm, Price Waterhouse &amp; Company, who undertook the 1978 audit did it in 1981 after Boerger had left her position. The pair were indicted for the embezzlement on August 12, 1982.

She died in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, aged 95.

<text>Paul Morgan Herbert (December 2, 1889 – July 5, 1983) was an American politician of the Republican Party who served three separate tenures as the 47th, 49th and 52nd lieutenant governor of Ohio. He was born in Marseilles, Ohio.

During the First World War, Herbert served in the United States Army. From 1922 to 1926, he served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives and then was elected to the Ohio State Senate, where he served from 1926 to 1930.

In 1938, he was elected to the lieutenant governorship for the first time and began his service in 1939. In 1940, he won re-election by defeating challenger Robert S. Cox. He won a third term in 1942 against George D. Nye. His first stint as lieutenant governor ended in 1945.

In 1946, Herbert unseated Nye from the lieutenant governorship, which he had won in 1944. He took office again in 1947. However, he served only one term since he lost to Nye in 1948. Herbert ran again for the office in 1956 and defeated John Taylor. However, he was again limited to one term and was unseated in 1958 by John W. Donahey.

Herbert served as a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court from 1963 to 1969. He died in 1983 in Dublin, Ohio, and is interred at Union Cemetery in Somerset, Ohio.

Herbert was married to Ruby F. Thomas on August 15, 1924. They had two children.

<text>The Duden () is a dictionary of the Standard High German language, first published by Konrad Duden in 1880, and later by Bibliographisches Institut GmbH, which was merged into Cornelsen Verlag in 2022.

The Duden is updated regularly with new editions appearing every four or five years. , it is in its 29th edition. It is printed as twelve volumes, with each volume covering different aspects of the German language such as loanwords, etymology, pronunciation, synonyms, etc.

The first of these volumes, &quot; (English: The German orthography), has long been the prescriptive source for Standard High German spelling. The Duden has become the most widely used language resource of the Standard High German language, stating the rules regarding grammar, spelling and use of Standard High German language. In Austria, the Österreichisches Wörterbuch takes that role.

==History==

===Konrad Duden&#x27;s Schleizer Duden (1872) and Urduden (1880)===
In 1872, Konrad Duden, then headmaster of a &#x27; (secondary school), had his treatise &quot;Die deutsche Orthoschrift&quot; (&quot;German orthography&quot;) published by B.G. Teubner in Leipzig. That book included both a dictionary and spelling rules for school use. Often known as the &quot;Schleizer Duden&quot; – the author was then the headmaster of a &#x27; (secondary school) in Schleiz, now in Thuringia — the work significantly influenced a debate about German spelling and became the template for subsequent dictionaries.

Eight years later, having moved to a grammar school in Hersfeld as headmaster, Konrad Duden&#x27;s main work was published, considerably expanded from the &quot;Schleizer Duden&quot;. The first edition of this new work, &quot;&quot; (Complete Orthographical Dictionary of the German Language), later sometimes referred to by the publisher as &quot;Urduden&quot;, was published in Leipzig and was the first major complete dictionary of German. This first &quot;Duden&quot; collected 28,000 keywords on 187 pages and subsequently prevailed throughout the German Empire as a standard reference work. From 1892, its spellings also became binding in Switzerland.

===From 1901 to 1996===
In 1902, the Bundesrat confirmed the Duden as the official standard for German spelling; Austria-Hungary and Switzerland soon followed suit. In the ensuing decades, the Duden continued to be the de facto standard for German orthography. After World War II this tradition continued separately in East and West Germany, in Leipzig and Mannheim, respectively.

In West Germany, some publishing houses began to attack the Duden &quot;monopoly&quot; in the 1950s, publishing dictionaries which contained alternative spellings. In reaction, in November 1955, the ministers of culture of the states of Germany confirmed the spellings given by the Duden would continue to be the official standard.

===East German Duden (Leipzig)===

In 1954, the first published Duden appeared in Mannheim, the western counterpart to the traditional Duden printing city of Leipzig. The first East German Duden appeared in Leipzig in 1951, but was largely ignored as illegitimate by West Germany. 

The printing continued in both Mannheim and Leipzig until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The differences between the two versions of Duden printed during this period appear in the number of entries (&#x27;). When the printing of the two Dudens began, in 1954 and 1951, the number of &#x27; included was roughly the same. 

As the split between the printers versions continued, the East German Duden slowly began diminishing the number of &#x27; in its volume while the West German Duden printed in Mannheim increased the number of &#x27;. The major differences between the two Dudens are seen in the lexical entries. 

The East German Duden included various loan words from Russian, particularly in the area of politics, such as &#x27; and &#x27;. Also new to the East German Duden were words stemming from Soviet agricultural and industrial organization and practices. Of note, there are a few semantic changes recorded in the East German Duden that evolved from contact with Russian. 

The East German Duden records the nominalization of German words by adding the suffix &quot;, borrowed from the Russian language suffix. 

Furthermore, additional words were recorded as a result of the increasing number of adverbs and adjectives negated with the prefix &#x27;, such as &#x27; (&quot;un-serious&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;un-concrete&quot;, &quot;&quot;). The few lexical and semantic items recorded in the East German Duden migrated from &#x27; because the printing press in Leipzig did not publish the multiple volume Duden which has become the current standard.

===Reform Duden===
On the cover of the Duden, 25th Edition, Volume 1, these words are printed in red letters: &quot;. This translates as: &quot;The comprehensive standard reference &quot;based on the current official rules&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;current official rules&quot; are the result of the German orthography reform of 1996.
