<text>The Audi Quattro is a road and rally car, produced by the German automobile manufacturer Audi, part of the Volkswagen Group. It was first shown at the 1980 Geneva Motor Show on 3 March. Production continued through 1991.

==Background==

The word &quot;quattro&quot; is derived from the Italian word for &quot;four&quot; to represent the fact that the vehicle delivers power to all four wheels. The name has also been used by Audi to refer to the quattro four-wheel-drive system, or any four-wheel-drive version of an Audi model. The original Quattro model is also commonly referred to as the Ur-Quattro - the &quot;&quot; (German for &quot;primordial&quot;, &quot;original&quot;, or &quot;first of its kind&quot;) is an augmentative prefix. The idea of such a car came from the Audi engineer Jörg Bensinger.

The Audi Quattro was the first rally car to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules that allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing. It won consecutive competitions for the next two years. To commemorate the success of the original vehicle, all subsequent Audi production automobiles with this four-wheel-drive system were badged with the trademark quattro with a lower case &quot;q&quot; letter.

The Audi Quattro shared many parts and platform with the Coupé version of the Audi 80 (B2). The quattro was internally designated &quot;Typ 85&quot;, a production code it shared with the quattro versions of the Audi Coupé. Its characteristic flared wheelarches were styled by Martin Smith. The Audi Quattro also had independent front and rear suspension.

==Production history==
The idea for a high-performance four-wheel-drive car was proposed in 1977 by Audi&#x27;s chassis engineer, Jörg Bensinger, after he found that the Volkswagen Iltis military vehicle could outperform other vehicles when tested in the snow. An Audi 80 variant was developed in co-operation with Walter Treser, Director of Pre-Development.

===European market===
Audi introduced the original Quattro to European customers in late 1980, featuring Audi&#x27;s quattro permanent four-wheel drive system, and the first to mate the front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout with a turbocharged engine.

The original engine was the , longitudinally-mounted inline-5-cylinder 10 valve SOHC, with a turbocharger and intercooler. It generated and torque of at 3,500 rpm, propelling the Quattro from 0 to in 7.1 seconds, and on to a top speed of over .

The displacement of the engine was dropped slightly from 2144 cc to 2133 cc with a bore x stroke of for the Rally car so that Audi could satisfy the 3-litre rallying class with a 1.4 times multiplication factor. Valvetrain was DOHC 4 valves per cylinder (20 valves in total) with an oil cooled KKK K27 turbocharger at and Air-to-Air - Längerer &amp; Reich intercooler fed by Bosch LH-Jetronic fuel injection, generating at 6,700 rpm and of torque at 3,700 rpm.

The engine was eventually modified to a inline-5 with 10 valves, still generating , but with peak torque lower in the rev-range. In 1989, it was then changed to a inline-five 20-valve DOHC setup generating , now with a top speed of .


The Quattro was partially hand-built on a dedicated line. Production totaled 11,452 units from 1980 to 1991, and through this 11 year production there were no major changes in the visual design of the car. For the 1983 model year, the dashboard did away with an analogue instrument cluster now fitted with a green digital liquid crystal display (LCD) electronic instrument cluster. This was later changed in 1988 to an orange LCD electronic instrument cluster. The interior was redesigned in 1984, and featured a new dashboard layout, new steering wheel design, and new centre console design, the switches around the instrument panel were also redesigned. In 1985, the dashboard changed slightly with harder foam and it lost a diagonal stripe, the switches were varied slightly and the diff lock pull knob gave way to a two-position turn knob with volt and oil temp digital readouts.
Exterior styling received little modification during the Quattro&#x27;s production run. Originally, the car had a flat front grille featuring four separate headlamp lenses, one for each of the low and high beam units. This was altered for the 1983 model year with combined units featuring a single lens housing twin reflectors. This was changed again, for the 1985 model year, in what has become known as the &#x27;facelift model&#x27; and included such alterations as a new sloping front grille, headlights, and trim and badging changes. The 20V RR Quattro also featured a new three-spoke steering wheel design, leather trim for door arm rests, gloveboxes, centre console and door pockets. There was also a full length leather-wrapped centre console running all the way to the rear seats and &#x27;quattro&#x27; script on the interior with partial leather seats. The floor on the driver&#x27;s side had a bulge due to dual catalytic exhaust setup. The different models may be distinguished by the emblems on their boot lids: the WR had a vinyl &#x27;quattro&#x27; decal or a brushed aluminium effect plastic emblem, the MB had chrome plated &#x27;Audi&#x27;, &#x27;Audi rings&#x27; and &#x27;quattro&#x27; emblems, whilst the RR had only chrome plated &#x27;Audi rings&#x27;.

The rear suspension was altered early on with geometry changes and removal of the rear anti-roll bar to reduce a tendency for lift-off oversteer. For the 1984 facelift, the wheel size went from 6x15-inch with 205/60-15 tyres to 8x15-inch wheels with 215/50-15 Pirelli Cinturato P5 tyres. At the same time the suspension was lowered by 20 mm with slightly stiffer springs for improved handling. For 1987, the Torsen centre differential was used for the first time, replacing the manual centre differential lock.

The last original Audi Quattro was produced on 17 May 1991, more than two years after the first models of the new Audi Coupé (8B) range (based on the 1986 Audi 80) had been introduced.

===North American market===
Sales of the Quattro in North America began in the 1983 model year. They entered the all-wheel-drive market established by the AMC Eagle, the first full-time automatic all-wheel-drive line of passenger cars to reach mass production. The small Subaru Leone station wagon offered an optional part-time 4-wheel drive system in the US market starting in 1975.

The North American Quattro was manufactured concurrently and were of the same design as their European 1982 model year counterparts (they did not include the minor cosmetic changes of the 1983 European model) and continued through 1986. Total sales in the U.S. totalled 664 units. The Canadian market cars were identical to the U.S. version with exception of the speedometer, which was metric. Official sales figures for Canada were 99 units, which included 61 sold in 1983, 17 sold in 1984, 18 sold in 1985, and 3 sold in 1986.

The U.S./Canadian cars were equipped with larger impact bumpers with built-in shock absorbers, like the rest of the 4000/Coupé models. They did not have anti-lock braking system (ABS), but included air conditioning and leather upholstery. Most of the 1984 and 1985 Canadian models came without sunroofs. The remainder of the electric, suspension, and cosmetic updates took place at the same time as the European cars.

The initial 2.1 L (2,144 cc, engine code &quot;WX&quot;) engine for U.S./Canadian models included minor component and engine control unit (ECU) changes, lowered turbocharger boost pressure, different camshaft, as well as emission controls that consisted of a catalytic converter and fuel control giving a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, lowering power output to . Other mechanical specifications were identical to the European market vehicles. The WX engine was also utilized in Swiss and Japanese market cars. Audi built 200 special edition cars in 1988 with the WX engine and analogue instrument cluster, with everything else identical to the MB model of that year.

==Press reviews==

In May 1981, &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine road tested a left hand drive Quattro (registration number WBD 335W), one of the first magazines to do so since it was introduced. Beginning with a photograph in the magazine of a Quattro cornering hard on Pendine beach in South-west Wales, Autocar&#x27;s Road Test Editor raved about the Quattro&#x27;s &quot;thrilling performance&quot; being impressed with its traction and acceleration particularly on wet, greasy and slippery surfaces, noting that only the Porsche 911 could match its traction and acceleration in slippery conditions. After extensive driving across the mountain roads of Wales, the Road Test editor mentioned that while the 60/40 front/rear weight distribution can make the Quattro &quot;tricky in extremis&quot; under very hard cornering, the editor wrote that &quot;When driven with respect, once you have learned its ways, the Quattro is nevertheless magnificent, particularly through a wet and deserted roundabout or series of open bends.&quot; The road test editor praised the interior&#x27;s &quot;comfortable refinement&quot; and judged that its 1981 £14,500 price tag &quot;is very good value for money considering its performance and the fact that its BMW, Porsche and Jaguar rivals cost £5000 more.&quot; (In summer 1981 both a Jaguar XJS V12 and BMW 6 Series Coupe on sale in the UK cost almost £20,000). Adding the caveat that in 1981 (and until summer 1983) the Quattro was only available in left hand drive in the UK, the Autocar Road Test concluded that the Quattro &quot;is a vastly satisfying and enjoyable car to drive.&quot;

==Audi quattro Spyder Concept (1991)==

The Audi quattro Spyder was a mid-engine coupé equipped with a 2.8-litre V6 engine taken from the Audi 100. The engine was rated at and of torque. The car was a rolling test bed for a future mid-engine sports car and featured a 5-speed manual gearbox, a modified version for the quattro four-wheel-drive system, aluminium body panels with a tubular steel space frame, kerb weight and a suspension system with trapezoidal links. All of the unique features depicted in the concept car would find their way in future Audi production vehicles.

The car was production-ready and garnered a lot of acclaim from both the motoring press and prospective buyers but due to the economic downturn of the 1990s, Audi decided not to press ahead with the project as the demand would not outweigh the development costs for the model.

The concept car was unveiled at the 1991 Frankfurt Motor Show.

==Audi quattro concept (2010)==
At the Paris Motor Show in 2010, Audi presented the quattro concept on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the original Audi Quattro and the Audi quattro four-wheel-drive system. Based on the RS5, it features a modified 2.5 L five-cylinder TFSI engine shared with the TT and a 6-speed manual transmission from the S4. The engine was claimed to generate a maximum power output of and of torque. The revolutionary design features depicted on the concept car would eventually make their way on future Audi models.

The concept utilised aluminium and carbon fibre construction which helped to achieve a total dry weight of . Weight saving was kept in consideration even throughout the interior and the seats also weighed each besides having adjustment motors. The dashboard featured an LCD console displaying vital information about the car and buttons arranged in a vertical way on the binnacle harked back to the original Audi Quattro. The wheelbase was shortened by and the roof line was shortened by as compared to the RS5.

The Quattro four-wheel-drive system used in the concept was a rear-biased design utilising a two-stage differential distributing power front and aft through planetary gears.

The concept utilised carbon-ceramic braking system for improved stopping power. The car had a claimed acceleration time of 3.8 seconds.

It was reported that Audi was considering a limited production model (200–500 cars) based on the quattro concept. However, the idea of production was scrapped in favour of expanding the company&#x27;s crossover range.

==Audi Sport quattro concept (2013)==

The Audi Sport quattro concept was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original Audi Sport quattro. The show car features angular flat C-pillars, as well as rectangular double headlights featuring Audi&#x27;s Matrix LED technology, a spoiler at the lower edge of the rear window, rectangular tail lights, 21-inch wheels, carbon fibre-ceramic brake discs, bucket seats with integrated head restraints, multifunction sport steering wheel, two driving modes (race and setup) in virtual 3D displays, Audi MMI control unit, and air conditioning. The doors and fenders were made of aluminum, while the roof, hood, and the rear hatch were made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer. The front suspension features five control arms per wheel while the rear has track-controlled trapezoidal link.

Power is from a 4.0 TFSI V8 engine rated at and , along with a disc-shaped electric motor rated at and (for combined a power output of and ), mated to an eight-speed tiptronic transmission. A liquid-cooled 14.1 kWh lithium-ion battery is located at the rear, and the range is claimed up to on electric power alone.

At the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, Audi presented the new 2014 Audi TT Quattro Sport Concept. It was powered by a 2.0 L four-cylinder TFSI engine generating a maximum power output of and of torque. The concept featured Audi&#x27;s Quattro AWD system and an S Tronic dual-clutch transmission.

===Quattro - A1 and A2 evolutions===
The original Audi Quattro competition car debuted in 1980, first as a development car, and then on a formal basis in the 1980 Jänner Rallye in Austria. Largely based on the bodyshell of the road-going Quattro models (in contrast to the forthcoming Group B cars), the engine of the original competition version produced approximately . In 1981, Michèle Mouton became the first female driver to win a world championship rally, piloting an Audi Quattro. Over the next three years, Audi would introduce the A1 and A2 evolutions of the Quattro in response to the new Group B rules, raising the power output of the turbocharged inline 5-cylinder engine to around .

The Quattro A1 debuted at the WRC 1983 season opener Monte Carlo Rally, and went on to win the Swedish Rally and the Rally Portugal in the hands of Hannu Mikkola. Driven by Stig Blomqvist, Mikkola and Walter Röhrl, the A2 evolution won a total of eight world rallies, three in 1983 and five in 1984. Two examples of the same car completely dominated the South African National Rally Championships during 1984 to 1988, with S.A. champion drivers Sarel van der Merwe and Geoff Mortimer.

In 1988, the Audi Ur-Quattro driven by Audi Tradition driver Luciano Viaro won the 13th Silvretta Classic Montafon.

===Sport Quattro===

The Audi Sport Quattro S1 was a variant of the Quattro developed for homologation for Group B rallying in 1984, and sold as a production car in limited numbers. It featured an all aluminium Inline-five engine with a bore x stroke of DOHC 4 valves per cylinder, Bosch LH Jetronic fuel injection and a KKK K27 turbocharger. The engine was slightly smaller than that of the standard Audi Quattro in terms of displacement in order to qualify for the 3-litre engine class after the 1.4 multiplication factor applied to turbocharged engines. In road-going form, the engine was capable of generating at 6,700 rpm and at 3,700 rpm, with the engine on the competition cars initially generating around .

The car in competition form also featured a body shell composed of carbon-kevlar and wider wheel arches, wider wheels (nine inches as compared to the Ur-Quattro&#x27;s optional wheels), the steeper windscreen rake of the Audi 80 (requested by the Audi Sport rally team drivers to reduce internal reflections from the dashboard for improved visibility) and, most noticeably, a shorter wheelbase.

In addition to Group B competition in rallying, the Sport Quattro won the 1985 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb with Michèle Mouton in the driving seat, setting a record time in the process. 224 cars in total of this &quot;short version&quot; Sport Quattro were built, and were offered for sale for DM 203,850.

===Sport Quattro S1 E2===
The Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2 was introduced at the end of 1985 as an update to the Audi Sport Quattro S1. The car featured an inline five-cylinder engine that displaced from a bore and stroke of and generated an officially quoted power output figure of . However, the turbocharger utilised a recirculating air system, with the aim of keeping the unit spinning at high rpm, when the driver closed the throttle, either to back off during cornering, or on gearshifts. This allowed the engine to resume full power immediately after the resumption of full throttle, reducing turbo lag. The actual power figure was in excess of at 8,000 rpm.

In addition to the improved power output, an aggressive aerodynamic kit was added that featured very distinctive wings and spoilers at the front and rear of the car to increase downforce. The weight was reduced to . The S1 could accelerate from 0- in 3.1 seconds. Some of the cars were supplied with a &quot;power-shift gearbox&quot;, a forerunner of the DSG technology.

The S1 E2 made its debut at the 1985 Rally Argentina, with Blomqvist driving. This variant was successful in the rally circuit, with Röhrl and Christian Geistdörfer winning the 1985 San Remo Rally. A modified version of the E2, was also driven by Michèle Mouton. The S1 E2 would become the final Group B car produced by Audi, with the works team withdrawing from the Championship following the 1986 rally in Portugal. The final factory cars of 1986 were rated at . In 1987, the car won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb driven by Walter Röhrl.

===Sport Quattro RS 002 ===

Audi Sport Quattro RS 002 - Sports prototype &quot;Group S&quot; was a rally car that was initially designed for the forthcoming Group S regulations for 1987. The car was tested by Walter Röhrl but it never raced; the Group S regulations were scrapped along with the Group B regulations after a number of accidents involving fatalities during the 1986 season.

The car has a longitudinal mid-engine layout and a four-wheel drive system.

==In popular culture==

A red 1983 Quattro was driven by DCI Gene Hunt (played by Philip Glenister) in the television drama &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (aired on BBC1 from 2008 to 2010). Two cars were used through the run of the series: the original, and a stunt car that was acquired for series 2. Both portrayed the same car. The original vehicle (also used in the &quot;Children in Need&quot; &quot;Top Gear&quot; crossover mini-episode) lacked a sunroof which was present on the car(s) used in series 2 and 3, hence a fake one was added for the sake of continuity. The stunt car was written off for the jump in series 3, episode 1 by the director of that episode and used as a parts and interior shots car until it was shot up in the finale, leaving the original car intact.
In the run-up to the 2010 general election, a campaign poster by the incumbent Labour Party government portrayed Conservative Party and opposition leader David Cameron as Gene Hunt sitting on the bonnet of the iconic red Audi Quattro and urged voters not to allow Cameron to take Britain &quot;back to the 1980s&quot; by electing his party into government amid fears that it would lead to a repeat of the social unrest and unemployment that Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government of that era oversaw. The image was then adopted by the Conservatives, with the slogan &quot;Fire up the Quattro, it&#x27;s time for change&quot;, with the comment &#x27;Idea kindly donated by the Labour Party&#x27;. &quot;Fire up the Quattro&quot; was a call to action uttered by DCI Hunt in &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;.

<text>Metsä Board Oyj, previously known as M-real Corporation, is a Finnish producer of fresh fibre paperboards including folding boxboards, food service boards and white kraftliners. It was originally established by G.A. Serlachius, and named &quot;Metsä-Serla&quot; (Forest Serla). Metsä Board is part of Metsä Group, one of the largest forest industry groups in the world.

On 29 September 2008, M-Real sold four of its paper mills to South African company, Sappi.

Nowadays, Metsä Board focuses on folding boxboards, food service boards and white kraftliners. Metsä Board has altogether seven production units in Finland (Kyro, Tako, Simpele, Äänekoski, Kemi, Joutseno, Kaskinen) and one in Sweden (Husum).

In autumn 2020, Metsä Board announced that it would open a competence center in Äänekoski focusing on cardboard and packaging. In the same factory area were housed, among others, Metsä Group&#x27;s bioproduct factory, cardboard factory, birch veneer factory, wood-based textile fiber test factory and a test factory producing 3D fiber products, which started to operate in May 2022.

<doc id="940354" wikidata="Q2948513" url="?curid=940354" title="Chameleon Twist">
<text>is a 1997 video game developed by Japan System Supply, published by Japan System Supply in Japan, and published by Sunsoft in North America and Europe for the Nintendo 64.

Though disliked by critics due to its easy gameplay, repetitive music, and awkward camera angles, &quot;Chameleon Twist&quot; was followed by a sequel titled &quot;Chameleon Twist 2&quot;.

This 3D platform game has players take on the role of one of four anthropomorphic chameleons, and travel across six themed worlds. The chameleon&#x27;s elongated tongue can be used as a weapon, a means to traverse gaps, or as a way to leap onto platforms. Once the tongue is unrolled, it can be guided in any direction using the analog stick. A five-room training area lets players practice the controls. The single-player game involves progressing through predominately indoor environments, each culminating in a boss battle, while collecting hearts to replenish health.

==Story==
The protagonist of the game is a blue chameleon named Davy who, upon following a rabbit (closely resembling the White Rabbit from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;) into a magical hole in the ground, finds he has taken on a humanoid form.

The plot involves Davy or one of his friends, Jack, Fred, or Linda, traveling throughout the six lands of the magic portal he enters, in an attempt to find a way back through the portal and back home, following the same rabbit he met before he entered the world.

==Gameplay==
Pressing the B button makes the player character stick out its tongue. Using the analog stick, players then control the movement of the tongue. This enables players to obtain power-ups from a distance or to swallow enemies. The tongue will extend until it reaches its full length and retracts back into the chameleon&#x27;s mouth, or until it bumps a wall, which yields the same result. As a basic attack, Davy and his friends, who have the same powers, can stick out their tongue and swallow enemies that stick to it. Once inside their mouth, the Chameleons have the option of spitting the enemies back out of their mouths at other enemies.

In order to jump up to levels of ground that are usually impossible to reach, the characters are able to launch themselves into the air by using their tongues. If used while the chameleon is moving in a particular direction, the jump is given even more altitude, in what is comparable to pole vaulting.

When faced with impassable gaps in the ground, player characters can grab a pole on the other side of the pit, allowing them to either move across the pit in a set direction. The player may rather choose to move across the pit in a circular motion by swinging around the pole by pressing the A button and the desired direction after grabbing the pole.

===Multiplayer===
In addition to the single-player game, &quot;Chameleon Twist&quot; offers a battle option, allowing two to four players the chance to take part in either a Battle Royal or Time Trial event. Battle Royal has players vying to be the last chameleon left standing on a suspended platform, while Time Trial rewards the chameleon that stays on the platform the longest. In the latter event, the chameleon that has fallen off the fewest times is considered the winner. Options include four difficulty settings for multiplayer games, adjustable battle lengths, and a choice of four stages for both the Battle Royal and Time Trial modes.

==Release==
The game was originally only planned for release in Japan, but Sunsoft and Nintendo thought children in the U.S. would enjoy the title.

==Reception==
&quot;Chameleon Twist&quot; received mixed reviews, with common criticisms being awkward camera angles which can cause the player to make mistakes, the short length, and the low difficulty. Some critics noted in its defense that the game was clearly targeted towards young children. &quot;GameSpot&quot;, for instance, concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s not outwardly offensive in any way; it&#x27;s just obviously aimed at a young audience. Really, it&#x27;s a pretty innocuous little game and probably worth a rental if you have an itch for another 3D N64 platformer. You won&#x27;t likely entertain any thoughts of buying it afterwards, except possibly as a present for a younger relative. Kids though, they&#x27;ll eat it up.&quot; Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (EGM) likewise commented, &quot;Obviously, &quot;Chameleon Twist&quot; is aimed at beginners, and with that in mind, I can see the appeal of the overly cute graphics and sickeningly sweet background tunes.&quot; The music was almost universally criticized as being overly saccharine and repetitive.

&quot;EGM&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; both also criticized the game as being wholly lacking in originality. &quot;GamePro&quot;, which gave one of the more positive reviews for &quot;Chameleon Twist&quot;, acknowledged that it is &quot;straight-forward hop-n-bop stuff&quot; and has issues with the graphics and audio, but argued that it has underlying entertainment value and even challenge. Contrarily, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; said the game has innovative mechanics and puzzles, but the novelty of the innovations wears off and the game ultimately becomes frustrating and dull. Peer Schneider similarly wrote in &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;While I liked some of the original touches and moves (the whole tongue thing is cool), the ugly graphics and sound, useless multiplayer mode and short quest keep me from recommending the game.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; and Sushi-X of &quot;EGM&quot; joined Schneider in describing the multiplayer modes as so unexciting as to be worthless, but &quot;GamePro&quot; and Sushi-X&#x27;s co-reviewer John Ricciardi described the Battle Royale mode as a highlight.

The game held a score of 59% on the review aggregation website GameRankings based on eight reviews. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 28 out of 40.

<doc id="940359" wikidata="Q2030370" url="?curid=940359" title="Wang Chung (band)">
<text>Wang Chung are an English new wave band, formed in London in 1980 by Nick Feldman, Jack Hues and Darren Costin. The name Wang Chung is Chinese (, ), meaning &quot;yellow bell&quot; in English, and is the first note in the Chinese classical music scale. The band found their greatest success in the US, with five top 40 hits there, all charting between 1983 and 1987, including &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; (No. 16 in 1984), &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; (No. 2 in 1986) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!&quot; (No. 9 in 1987).

==Career==
===1977–1979: Early years===
Jeremy Ryder, known professionally as Jack Hues (lead vocals and guitar), and Nick Feldman (guitar) would eventually form the core of Wang Chung. They first met when Hues answered Feldman&#x27;s advertisement for musicians in the classifieds section of the weekly British music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1977. They were joined by Bud Merrick on bass and Paul Hammond (ex-Atomic Rooster) on drums, forming the Intellektuals.

In less than a year, that band broke up. Hues and Feldman then joined up with future Wang Chung drummer Darren Costin, bassist Leigh Gorman, keyboardist Simon Campbell and vocalist Glenn Gregory, to form 57 Men. This band lasted for about eighteen months before breaking up. Gorman would go on to play bass in Adam and the Ants, Gregory went on to become the lead vocalist for Heaven 17, and Gorman later played in Bow Wow Wow.

Hues, Feldman and Costin stayed together and renamed themselves Huang Chung. According to Feldman, he came across the term &quot;Huang Chung&quot;, meaning &quot;yellow bell&quot; in Mandarin, in a book he was reading, and used it as the name for the band.

===1980–1982: Huang Chung years===
At the beginning of Huang Chung&#x27;s career, all the members performed under pseudonyms. Jeremy Ryder was &quot;Jack Hues&quot; (a play on Emile Zola&#x27;s 1898 open letter &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot;), Nick Feldman was &quot;Nick DeSpig&quot;, and Darren Costin was &quot;Darren Darwin&quot; (and later, just &quot;Darwin&quot;). The band then signed to a label called 101 Records. The first Huang Chung release, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Hu-man&quot;, appeared on a 101 compilation album in 1980. Three live tracks were subsequently released on another 101 Records compilation in 1981.

Later in 1980, the independent record company Rewind Records signed the band for a two-single deal. Huang Chung&#x27;s debut single for Rewind Records was &quot;Isn&#x27;t It About Time We Were on TV&quot;, followed by &quot;Stand Still&quot;. Neither single charted, but the group had begun to attract the attention of Arista Records, who signed them on a two-album deal in early 1981. Around the same time, the group expanded to a quartet, with the addition of saxophonist Dave Burnand. In keeping with the all-pseudonymous nature of the band, Burnand was known as &quot;Hogg Robinson&quot; for the first Arista single, and later, simply as &quot;Hogg&quot;.

Under the direction of producer Rhett Davies, Huang Chung issued two singles on Arista in 1981, neither of which charted. A third single, produced by Roger Bechirian, appeared in early 1982; it too failed to chart. The band&#x27;s debut studio album was issued in 1982. Self-titled, it compiled the three non-charting Arista A-sides, one of the Arista B-sides, and six other new tracks. Like the associated singles, the &quot;Huang Chung&quot; album failed to chart.

At the time the band&#x27;s self-titled album was issued, Hues, DeSpig and Burnand also contributed to the lone studio album by mysterious pseudonymous group Blanket of Secrecy. Hues and DeSpig wrote the song &quot;Lovers&quot; for the album, and Hues scored the strings for that song, while Burnand played saxophone on the album. Despite some speculation at the time, no member of Huang Chung was actually a member of Blanket of Secrecy — that band consisted of Roger Bechirian, Andrew Howell and Pete Marsh, operating under the pseudonyms Tinker, Soldier, and Tailor.

In late 1982, Huang Chung returned to the studio to start work on their second studio album for Arista Records. A new single, &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot;, was produced by Tim Friese-Greene and appeared as both a 7&quot; and 12&quot; single in October, but did not chart. The band were still a quartet at this point, with Feldman dropping the assumed &quot;De Spig&quot; surname and billing himself simply as &quot;Nick&quot;.

After the failure of &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot;, the group&#x27;s manager, David Massey, convinced Arista to close their contract with Huang Chung, and instead placed the band with American label Geffen Records, making the group the second UK-based act to be signed to Geffen worldwide after Asia (not counting then-New York-based John Lennon in 1980). Burnand left the group around this time, citing &quot;musical differences&quot;.

===1983–1985: Name change and initial success===

In 1983 they were still billed under the band name &quot;Huang Chung&quot; at BBC 2 music show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;.

At this juncture, according to Hues, the band changed the spelling of their name to &quot;Wang Chung&quot;, at Geffen&#x27;s suggestion, to make the pronunciation easier for English-speakers.

At the same time, Nick Feldman and Darren Costin opted to be billed under their real full names; only Jack Hues kept his pseudonym. The band spent most of 1983 recording their second studio album, &quot;Points on the Curve&quot;. Released in July 1983, the album yielded two moderately successful hits, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; (No. 38 US) and a re-recorded version of &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; (No. 16 US, No. 21 UK). The popularity of the latter song gave Wang Chung the ability to spend two months touring the United States on their own and with the Romantics and Berlin. In 1984 they would be the opening act for The Cars on their &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; tour; Costin would leave the band following this tour, and went on to form his own group, Heroes, which released the studio album &quot;Here We Are&quot; on RCA Records in 1987.

In late 1983, Hues and Feldman collaborated in a one-off project with vocalist David Van Day of duo Dollar. A demo of the track &quot;Ringing the Bell&quot; was submitted to Van Day by their publisher as one of many songs for consideration by Van Day as a possible follow up to his single &quot;Young Americans Talking&quot;. It was recorded in November 1983 but remained unreleased for some time before eventually surfacing under the band name &quot;Music Academy&quot; in 1985. Wang Chung followed up the release of &quot;Points on the Curve&quot; with a spate of soundtrack work. Director William Friedkin specifically sought out Wang Chung to score his 1985 film &quot;To Live and Die in L.A&quot;.

The resulting soundtrack became the group&#x27;s third studio album, and is recognizable as one of their more mainstream works. It went top ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for soundtracks. The band recorded &quot;Fire in the Twilight&quot; for the 1985 John Hughes film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and contributed &quot;There Is a Nation&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;First Born&quot;. With Costin gone, Hues and Feldman continued to record new material, employing producer Peter Wolf as their new drummer (although he never became an official member of the band).

===1986–1989: US commercial peak===
Wang Chung released their fourth studio album, &quot;Mosaic&quot;, in 1986. This album spun off their biggest hits: &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; (No. 2 US) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!&quot; (No. 9 US). &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; features the lyric &quot;Everybody Wang Chung tonight&quot;, and also has a music video (directed by Godley &amp; Creme) where virtually every frame featured a jump cut. During some US dates in the summer of 1987, they were the opening act for Tina Turner during her Break Every Rule World Tour.

Their final US top 40 single, &quot;Hypnotize Me&quot; (No. 36), was also from the same album, and also was featured on the soundtrack of the 1987 film &quot;Innerspace&quot;. Wang Chung released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Warmer Side of Cool&quot;, in 1989. The album featured &quot;Praying to a New God&quot; (No. 63 US), which charted but was not a hit. The album was considered a commercial disappointment. Hues and Feldman then went on to other projects and the band effectively disbanded in 1990.

===1990–1997: Hiatus===
During the 1990s, Feldman joined up with drummer Jon Moss of Culture Club to form the band Promised Land, and subsequently released their self-titled debut studio album, &quot;Promised Land&quot;, in 1992. Also in the 1990s, Hues worked on various film soundtracks, including &quot;The Guardian&quot; (1990). He was signed to a solo deal by Sony Records in the early 1990s, but his intended debut solo studio album, &quot;The Anatomy Lesson&quot;, was shelved by the label and remains unreleased. Hues later teamed up with Tony Banks of Genesis to form the one-off group Strictly Inc., which released a self-titled studio album in 1995.

===1997–2016: Reformation===
1997 saw the return of Wang Chung, still consisting of Hues and Feldman, with a greatest hits collection entitled &quot;Everybody Wang Chung Tonight: Wang Chung&#x27;s Greatest Hits.&quot; Included on this CD was a new single, &quot;Space Junk&quot;. The group also toured North America around this time to promote the new compilation. A 2000 edition of Wang Chung played several dates in the United States, both headlining their own tour and also a part of the Club 80s Flashback Tour with A Flock of Seagulls, Missing Persons, and Gene Loves Jezebel with Michael Aston. Hues was the only original member of this iteration of the band, as Feldman bowed out due to other commitments.

In March 2005, Wang Chung (once again consisting of Hues and Feldman) contributed &quot;Akasha&quot;, a previously unreleased song, to the &quot;Of Hands and Hearts&quot; compilation, in response to the 2004 Southeast Asia tsunami crisis. In June 2005, Wang Chung appeared on the reality TV series &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot;, performing &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; by Nelly.

Beginning in June 2009, Wang Chung were a part of the Regeneration &#x27;80s tour along with ABC, Berlin, Cutting Crew, and Missing Persons. In June 2010, Wang Chung released a digital &quot;double EP&quot; entitled &quot;Abducted by the 80s&quot;. This was subsequently released as a double CD set in mid-2011. The eight song collection included four re-recordings of previous hits, and four new songs. Wang Chung toured the United States from June to July 2010 to promote the new release.

On 21 September 2010, The Beatles Complete on Ukulele released Wang Chung&#x27;s reworking of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rain&quot;, in an arrangement which features the ukulele. On 31 October 2010 their song &quot;Space Junk&quot; was featured in the pilot episode of the AMC series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (and is also included on the episode &quot;What Comes After&quot;). &quot;The Fighter&quot;, a 2010 film starring Mark Wahlberg, featured Wang Chung&#x27;s music.

They played the Rewind Festival in Perth in July 2012, and Henley-on-Thames in August 2012. In December that year, Wang Chung released &quot;Tazer Up!&quot;, their first studio album in 23 years. All four original tracks from &quot;Abducted by the 80s&quot; appear on &quot;Tazer Up!&quot; (some in remixed and/or edited form); the album also features a remix of the re-recorded &quot;Abducted&quot; version of &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot;. The remaining 6 tracks are unique to this release. In 2013, Darren Costin rejoined Wang Chung for a special one-off performance in England.

===2016: Jack Hues on hiatus===

In 2016, the band began to perform live with Gareth Moulton of Cutting Crew on lead vocals.

===2017–present===
In 2017, Hues returned to performing live with Wang Chung, and in 2019, they recorded a greatest hits album with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra titled &quot;Orchesography.&quot; Two EPs consisting of the orchestral versions and remixes were released of &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; and &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; on both CD and digital download. &quot;Orchesography&quot; was released on 10 May 2019.

In 2024, Wang Chung headlined the Abducted by the 80&#x27;s tour with 18 dates across the US and Canada with fellow 80&#x27;s acts Men Without Hats, The Motels, and Naked Eyes.

<text>Wesley &quot;Wes&quot; Williams (born March 31, 1968) is a Canadian rapper, singer, record producer, actor, and author. He is known professionally by his stage names Maestro Fresh Wes (formerly Maestro Fresh-Wes) or Maestro as a musician, and is credited by his birth name as an actor. One of the earliest Canadian rappers to achieve mainstream success, he is credited as the &quot;Godfather of Canadian hip hop&quot;. His debut album, &quot;Symphony in Effect&quot; (1989), was the first certified platinum album by a Black Canadian artist, and his 2023 induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and 2024 Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award were each the first for any hip-hop artist.

==Early life and education==
Williams was born on March 31, 1968, in Toronto, Ontario, to parents of Afro-Guyanese heritage. He is the oldest of three children and was raised in North York and Scarborough. He attended Senator O&#x27;Connor College School and then moved to L&#x27;Amoreaux Collegiate Institute for the remainder of his high school career.

He attended Carleton University in Ottawa, studying law and political science for one year.

==Career==

===1979–1989: Early career===
Williams&#x27; interest in hip hop music began at age 11. At age 15, in 1983, he met DJ Ron Nelson, who promoted Williams&#x27; music under the moniker Melody MC with Ebony MC as the rap group Vision MC’s on his radio show, 88.1 CKLN-FM. Nearly two years later, Williams met Farley Flex, who he went on to work with in 1988. That same year, he officially adopted the name Maestro Fresh-Wes and recorded the independent demos, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop Us Now&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Showin&#x27; You&quot;. While performing on MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;Electric Circus&quot;, Wes met dance artist Stevie B, who connected him with his NYC-based label, LMR. This changed the climate for hip hop in Canada as Wes performed &quot;Let Your Backbone Slide&quot; for the first time. This song became the first single from a Canadian hip hop artist to go gold, followed by Canada&#x27;s first platinum-selling hip hop album, &quot;Symphony in Effect&quot;.

===1989–1991: &quot;Symphony in Effect&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Repress the Cause&quot;===
In 1989, Maestro released his first album, &quot;Symphony in Effect&quot;. The following year he became the first Canadian rapper to have a Billboard Top 40 hit, &quot;Let Your Backbone Slide&quot;. In 1991, he collaborated on the one-off single &quot;Can&#x27;t Repress the Cause&quot;, a plea for greater inclusion of hip hop music in the Canadian music scene.

In 1992, Maestro appeared in a video accompanying a rendition of &quot;O Canada&quot; in which he rapped an improvised second-verse lyric, &quot;aw, yeah, from the east coast, of Newfoundland, to the west coast, of B.C.&quot;. He returned to the Canadian charts in 1998 with the hit singles &quot;Stick to Your Vision&quot; and &quot;416/905 (T.O. Party Anthem)&quot;.

In 2012, Maestro released his first set of new material in over seven years with the release of the EP &quot;Black Tuxedo&quot;, which was nominated for Best Rap Recording of the Year at the 2012 Juno Awards. This was followed by the album &quot;Orchestrated Noise&quot; in 2013, which features rocker Sam Roberts, opera singer Measha Brueggergosman, Kardinal Offishall, American rapper Kool G Rap of the Juice Crew, and Brand Nubian veteran Sadat X, among others. &quot;Orchestrated Noise&quot; was released under the name Maestro Fresh Wes, reclaiming his original title from the 1980s.

===2020–present===

In 2020, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Williams and his family moved to the port city of Saint John, New Brunswick. The radio show &quot;Maestro In The Maritimes&quot; became a regional favourite featuring his own playlists and commentary. 
In 2021, Willams published his second children&#x27;s book &quot;Stick To Your Vision: Young Maestro Goes to School&quot; that encourages fun and self expression through hip hop, poetry, and music. His performance of &quot;Let Your Backbone Slide&quot; was performed and celebrated at the 50th anniversary presentation of the country&#x27;s Juno Awards. 
in the summer of 2021, he was cast as the host of the hit reality show &quot;Race Against the Tide&quot; show which aired on CBC in July of 2022. Produced by Toronto-based Marble Media, and filmed on New River Beach, New Brunswick, the series brings together the best sand sculptors in the world to win challenges before the tide sweeps their art away.

In 2024, Williams was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, becoming the first hip-hop musician to do so.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to childhood:

Children – biologically, a child (plural: children) is generally a human between the stages of birth and puberty. Some definitions include the unborn (termed fetus). The legal definition of &quot;child&quot; generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority. &quot;Child&quot; may also describe a relationship with a parent or authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in &quot;a child of nature&quot; or &quot;a child of the Sixties.&quot;

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Luxembourg]]. While liberal thought has had a long history within Luxembourg, organized political liberalism has only been since 1904 when the Liberal League was formed. It wasn&#x27;t until 1925 that a liberal party became relatvant and since then, a liberal party has been one of the three major political forces in the Grand-Duchy. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. Not all parties listed have the word &quot;liberal&quot; in their names.

<doc id="940377" wikidata="Q704989" url="?curid=940377" title="Robert Esmie">
<text>Robert Esmie (born July 5, 1972) is a Canadian retired sprinter, who was a member of the gold medal-winning Canadian 4 × 100 m relay team at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Born in Kingston, Jamaica, and raised in Sudbury, Ontario, Esmie was part, along with Glenroy Gilbert, Bruny Surin and Donovan Bailey, of a 4 × 100 m relay team in the mid-1990s. They were number one in the world from 1994 to 1999.

Esmie placed seventh (10.23) in the second semi-final of the 100 m and won a bronze medal in the 4 × 100 m relay at the 1993 World Championships. At the 1994 Commonwealth Games, he competed in the 100 metres.

Esmie won a bronze medal in the 60 m at the 1995 World Indoor Championships and was again a member of gold medal-winning Canadian 4 × 100 m relay team at the 1995 World Championships.

At the Atlanta Olympics the Canadian men&#x27;s 4×100 relay team was not favored despite winning most high-profile titles in the previous three years, including the 1995 World Championships. Leading up to the Olympics, the United States team of Jon Drummond, Tim Harden, Michael Marsh and Dennis Mitchell claimed they would beat Canada; however, in the 4×100 relay final the Canadian team beat the United States by almost half a second to win the gold in national record time. Esmie was not originally slated to run with the relay team due to politics; while Esmie was ranked third in Canada before the relay began but as the team was falling apart they decided to replace Carlton Chambers the night before the race after Chambers suffered a groin injury in the 200 m.

Esmie&#x27;s gold medal was later stolen.

Esmie and the Canadian team won a gold medal again from lane 8 at the 1997 World Championships.

In 2008 he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4×100 relay team.

Esmie now runs AirBlastoff Sports, an athletic training program.

<text>The Bothnia Line () is a high-speed railway line in northern Sweden. The long route, from Höga Kusten Airport, where it connects to the Ådalen Line, via Örnsköldsvik to Umeå, was opened in 2010 and trains are allowed to travel at speeds up to . Although, no train with a higher top speed than uses the railway as of 2023.

==Introduction==
Completed in August 2010, the Bothnia Line adds of high-speed railway to the Swedish railway network. At up to this is also the highest-speed track in the country. The route branches off from the Ådalen Line at Höga Kusten Airport just north of Kramfors and goes via Örnsköldsvik to Umeå where it connects to the Umeå-Vännäs line and the Main Line Through Upper Norrland. The railway line has 140 bridges and of tunnels.

Construction was carried out by Botniabanan AB, a company owned 91% by the Swedish government and 9% by the municipalities of Kramfors, Örnsköldsvik, Nordmaling and Umeå. Work began on the line in 1999, and reached the halfway point at the end of 2005. After its completion in 2010, the line was leased to the Swedish Rail Administration. When Botniabanan AB has recovered its investment (estimated to be 2050), the ownership of the line will pass to the Rail Administration. The construction budget was SEK 15 billion.

It is intended that the Bothnia Line will compete with road transport using the European route E4, which is a main road carrying heavy freight traffic; however because the line uses the European Rail Traffic Management System signal system, which most of Sweden does not, relatively few freight train operators have invested in the ERTMS technology for their locomotives.

Passenger traffic between Umeå and Örnsköldsvik began in August 2010. The delayed upgrade of the ERTMS signal system on the Ådalen Line meant that traffic south of Örnsköldsvik did not begin until 2012.

==Purpose==
A railway line along the coast of northern Sweden has been considered beneficial for many years, with a lack of capacity and long travel times on the existing main line (further inland) because of lower speed limits, curves, and gradients. The Bothnia line also improves public mobility in the area, reducing the travel time between Umeå and Örnsköldsvik to 50 minutes via high-speed train. It is also served by regional trains, at a frequency of up to two trains (mostly one train) in each direction an hour.

==Railway standard==

The line is single track (with grading and other provisions for a second track), and has 22 passing loops. The maximum axle weight is 25 tonnes at (freight trains) and permitted for passenger trains. Curves have a radius of or more, except for the passage of Örnsköldsvik (down to and a few between . The maximum grade is 1%.

==Delayed stretch through the natural reservation area==

The middle part of the railway was ready for traffic in 2008, and all of the railway except the northern part from October 2009. The northern part, near Umeå, did not see operation until August 2010, due to a court battle over the placement of a bridge that crosses over environmentally sensitive areas at the Ume River. These areas are protected as a nature reserve and the process to approve its location was opposed by environmentalists and neighbours concerned about their properties. Other alternatives to the present location were deemed unacceptably close to the Umeå Airport for safety reasons, and a tunnel under the airport and river would have been much too expensive. A more southerly route would have lengthened the line and been more expensive. The crux of this debate was that the nature reserve was established some years after the railway line placement had been fixed.

There was no passenger traffic before all of the railway was finished, because the largest city, Umeå, was not connected to this line before then, though some freight traffic used the finished sections.

==Times, distances and average speed==


The railway line itself allows . The trains will run at for the first several years, with a speed increase in the future. As of 2021, scheduled for around 2025, when SJ gets new Alstom Zefiro designed for .

The Transitio leasing company owned by the counties signed a contract in October 2008 to buy Alstom Coradia trains. These trains were delivered in 2011, and they have a top speed of . For long-distance trains from Stockholm, SJ runs X55 trains, with a top speed of . So far the suppliers cannot guarantee winter characteristics above , since there is no experience operating at such speeds in the northern Swedish climate. Still 2023, no trains run here above since operator hasn&#x27;t bought faster trains considering it&#x27;s the only railway in Sweden allowing it above , and the fact that air travel is much faster Stockholm-Umeå anyway.

The Bothnia Line was also the first line in Sweden equipped with the signalling system ERTMS (Level 2) and has been tested at on the southern part of the Bothnia Line. Currently, Swedish signalling and its ATP safety system (ATC - Automatic Train Control) is only validated up to .

Parts of the railway started to be used by freight trains on 16 October 2008, but with manual train protection control.

No Alstom train was delivered for the traffic opening in August 2010, since the delivery time is at least two years. One train of the type Regina was rented from southern Sweden for the Umeå-Örnsköldsvik traffic, with a top speed of . Traffic to and from Sundsvall started autumn 2012. SJ ran the Stockholm-Narvik and Göteborg-Luleå night trains over Långsele-Mellansel-Örnsköldsvik-Umeå from August 2010, and from 2012 the shorter way Sundsvall-Kramfors-Umeå.

==Stations==

The trains stop at:

On the Ådalen Line:
*Sundsvall Central Station 319.391 km
*Timrå 295.681 km
*Härnösand 248.051 km
*Kramfors 208.366 km
*Västeraspby (transfer, upon request, to the Höga Kusten Airport; about 2 km road distance)
On the Bothnia Line:
*Örnsköldsvik Central Station 115.402 km
*Örnsköldsvik North 112.986 km
*Husum 90.313 km
*Nordmaling 58.109 km
*Hörnefors 34.856 km
*Umeå East Station 2.016 km
*Umeå Central Station 0 km
Some trains stop at the larger stations only.

The most used station is forecast to be Umeå East, since it is within walking distance of Umeå University and the University Hospital. Umeå Central Station was closed in 2010-2011 for rebuilding.

==Ådalen Line==

The Bothnia Line ends near the Höga Kusten Airport at the existing Ådalen Line, which runs Långsele–Kramfors–Härnösand–Sundsvall. The distance from the connection to Sundsvall is . This railway was built from 1890 to 1925, and is rather curvy and in poor condition. From 2003 to 2012, the Ådalen Line was improved along the existing route to allow higher speeds than before, with a maximum speed of . The improvements included new rails, new catenary, a new signalling system (ERTMS) and better and fewer road crossings. A few parts of it north of Härnösand (totalling ) were replaced with a new route, built to the same standard as the Bothnia Line, with a maximum speed of . The reason for keeping most of the existing route is that the advantage of building a new railway is smaller when there already is a railway, but the costs for a new railway would be the same as if there was no railway, which is the case along the Bothnia Line. The total improvement cost for the Ådalen Line was 6 billion SEK.

==Old main line==

The Main Line Through Upper Norrland from Bräcke to Boden was built between 1880 and 1895. It was deliberately built inland from the coast to protect it from military attacks. The Bothnia Line replaced all passenger traffic on the Main Line Through Upper Norrland between Bräcke and Vännäs, ending service to the stations at Långsele and Mellansel. The line remains in use by freight traffic and occasional diversions of passenger trains during engineering works.

==North Bothnia Line==

The North Bothnia Line (&quot;Norrbotniabanan&quot;) is a planned extension of the Bothnia Line north of Umeå to Luleå. The distance is about , longer than the Bothnia Line. The preliminary decision to build the line as far as Skellefteå has been made. Construction began in 2020 on the first section of the line from Västerslätt in Umeå to Sävar.

Both the North Bothnia Line and the Bothnia Line will have the advantage of immediately reducing the cost of the frequent and heavy freight traffic when finished. They will provide large travel time reductions for passengers compared to buses; for example, travel time between Umeå and Luleå may be reduced by at least 1.5 hours.

<text>Bruny Surin (born July 12, 1967) is a Canadian former track and field athlete, who was the winner of a gold medal in the 4×100 metres relay at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 2008 he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4x100 relay team. In the 100 metres, he has broken the 10-second barrier multiple times and holds a personal record of 9.84 seconds.

==Career==
Surin was born in Cap-Haïtien, Haïti, and moved to Québec City with his family in 1975. He made his debut for Canada at the 1987 Pan-American Games, placing fifteenth in the long jump, a result he repeated at the 1988 Olympics.

After the Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988, manager Enrico Dionisi brought Surin to Siena and he was trained by the Italian coach Franco Barucci. Barucci persuaded Surin away from his favoured long jump event, in favour of the 100 m. Barucci predicted he could run 10.10 seconds for the event. Surin won the following Canadian championships in 10.14 seconds.

At the 1990 Commonwealth Games, Surin won a bronze medal in 100 m and was seventh in the long jump. At the 1991 World Championships, Surin was eighth in the 100 m, and at the 1992 Summer Olympics he was 4th in the 100m and reached the semifinals as a member of Canadian 4 × 100 m relay team.

At the 1993 World Championships, Surin was fifth in 100 m and won a bronze medal as a member of Canadian 4 × 100 m relay team. At the 1994 Commonwealth Games, Surin won the gold medal in 4 × 100 m relay and was eliminated in the semifinal of 100 m. Competing for the province of Quebec, Surin edged out Donovan Bailey to win gold in the 100 m at the 1994 Francophone Games in Paris with a games record time of 10.08 seconds. At the 1995 World Championships, Surin won a silver medal in 100 m, behind compatriot Bailey, and a gold medal as a member of Canadian 4 × 100 m relay team.

At the Atlanta Olympics, the Canadian relay team were not favoured, although they had won almost all of the titles available during the previous two years, but they had done it in absence of the United States team. However, in the 4 × 100 m relay final, the Canadian team beat United States by almost half a second, establishing itself the best relay team in the world. Surin also reached the semifinal of 100 m in the same competition.

Surin and the Canadian team won a gold medal again at the 1997 World Championships and a silver medal at the 1998 Goodwill Games. He was also seventh in 100 m at the 1997 World Championships and won a silver medal in 100 m at the 1999 World Championships. His time matched Donovan Bailey&#x27;s Canadian record of 9.84. At the time, this was the fastest losing time in a 100 m race.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Surin, one of the gold medal favorites, had not fully recovered from a leg injury sustained at the Canadian championships earlier that summer, and was eliminated in the semifinals of the 100m after slowing down visibly in pain and walking the rest of the way through the finish line. His last major championship race was in the semifinals of the 100 m at the 2001 World Championships, where he injured himself again and was pushed off the track in a wheelchair.

In 2009, Surin became the new Canadian 50 metres record holder (40-45 age group) with a time of 6.15s at the McGill Open.

In May 2022, Surin was named Team Canada&#x27;s chef de mission for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

===Track records===

As of 9 September 2024, Surin holds the following track records for 100 metres.

==Honours==
In 2016, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.

==Book: &quot;Bruny Surin, le lion tranquille&quot;==
In 2009, a biography cowritten by Bruny Surin and Saïd Khalil entitled &quot;Bruny Surin, le lion tranquille&quot; was published by &quot;Éditions Libre Expression&quot; in Montreal. The book covers Bruny Surin recounting 17 years of his sports career. In the book, Surin criticizes doping, describing it as a gangrene that ails athletics and all other sports.

Surin emigrated to Canada with his family in 1975. His father lost his family in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has two daughters. Surin ran for a seat on Laval City Council in a by-election on November 24, 2019, but lost by 82 votes.

<text>Camil Petrescu (; 9/21 April 1894 – 14 May 1957) was a Romanian playwright, novelist, philosopher and poet. He marked the end of the traditional novel era and laid the foundation of the modern novel era in Romania. He was a member of the Sburătorul and a mentor to the writer Anișoara Odeanu.

== Life ==
Petrescu was born in Bucharest in 1894. He lost both his parents early in life and was raised by a relative, or a nanny from the Moșilor suburb (the sources remain quite unclear on this).

Petrescu went to primary school at Obor, and to high school at Saint Sava National College, where he wrote his very first poem. Being very poor, he studied assiduously, worked to support himself, and relatively late—at the age of 29—he began his studies in philosophy at the University of Bucharest. His antisemitism is controversial, having Jewish friends such as Mihail Sebastian.

In 1916, Petrescu was drafted and sent to the battlefields of then raging World War I, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Austro-Hungarians in 1917. Freed in 1918, he depicted his war experiences in his 1930 novel &#x27; (&quot;Last Night of Love, First Night of War&quot;). In 1933, Petrescu wrote the novel &#x27; (&quot;The Bed of Procrustes&quot;; see Procrustes&#x27; bed). He was a teacher in Timișoara, and director of the National Theater Bucharest. He was elected titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1948. He died in 1957 in Bucharest, and was buried at the city&#x27;s Bellu Cemetery.

<text>Yann Pierre Tiersen (born 23 June 1970) is a French Breton musician and composer. His musical career is split between studio recordings, music collaborations, and film soundtracks songwriting. His music incorporates a large variety of classical and contemporary instruments, primarily the electric guitar, the piano, synthesisers, and the violin, but he also includes instruments such as the melodica, xylophone, toy piano, harpsichord, piano accordion, and even a typewriter.

Tiersen is often mistaken for a soundtrack composer; he himself states that &quot;I&#x27;m not a composer and I really don&#x27;t have a classical background,&quot; but his real focus is on touring and recording studio albums, which are often used for film soundtracks. Tracks taken from his first three studio albums were used for the soundtrack of the 2001 French film &quot;Amélie&quot;.

==Biography and career==
===The early years: 1970–1992===
Tiersen was born in 1970 in Brest, in the department of Finistère, part of Brittany in northwestern France, into a French family of Belgian and Norwegian origins. He started learning to play the piano at the age of four, the violin at the age of six, and received classical training at several musical academies, including those in Rennes, Nantes, and Boulogne-sur-Mer. In the early 1980s, he was influenced as a teenager by the punk subculture, and bands like The Stooges and Joy Division. When he was 13, he broke his violin, bought an electric guitar, and formed a rock band. Tiersen was living in Rennes back then, home to the three-day music festival Rencontres Trans Musicales, which is held annually in December. That gave him the opportunity to see acts like Nirvana, Einstürzende Neubauten, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Cramps, Television, and Suicide. A few years later, when his band parted, Tiersen bought a cheap mixing desk, an 8-track reel-to-reel tape recorder, and started recording music on his own with a synthesiser, a sampler, and a drum machine.

===Debut and national acclaim: 1993–2000===
Before releasing film scores under his own name, Tiersen recorded background music for a number of plays and short films. During the summer of 1993, Tiersen stayed in his apartment with an electric guitar, a violin and a piano accordion, recording music on his own; he was guided by what he calls &quot;a musical anarchic vision&quot;. By the end of the summer, Tiersen had recorded over forty tracks, which would most be used later on for his first two albums. Tiersen&#x27;s debut album, &quot;La Valse des monstres&quot;, limited to 1,000 copies, was first released in June 1995 by independent record label Sine Terra Firma, and then reissued by Nancy-based record label Ici d&#x27;ailleurs in 1998 as the second album of its catalogue. The 17-track-album was inspired by and written for the theatrical adaptations of Tod Browning&#x27;s 1932 cult classic &quot;Freaks&quot;, and Yukio Mishima&#x27;s 1955 version of Noh play &quot;The Damask Drum&quot;. In April 1996, one year later, he released &quot;Rue des cascades&quot;, a collection of short pieces recorded with a toy piano, a harpsichord, a violin, a piano accordion, and a mandolin. The title track, sung by French solo singer Claire Pichet, was used the following year for the Palme d&#x27;Or nominated French drama film &quot;The Dreamlife of Angels&quot;, and several tracks received greater exposure when they were featured on the Jean-Pierre Jeunet&#x27;s film &quot;Amélie&quot;, five years later. Tiersen usually plays most of the music instruments himself during both studio recording sessions and his live sets; he has won theatrical appeal as a one-man show and was invited to play, among others, at the 1996 edition of the Avignon Festival, the oldest live arts festival in France.
Tiersen rose to domestic fame upon the release of his third studio album, &quot;Le Phare&quot; (&quot;The Lighthouse&quot;) in 1998. The album was recorded in self-imposed seclusion on the isle of Ushant (, ) at the end of the English Channel which marks the most north-western point of territorial France. Tiersen spent two months there, living in a rented house. At night-time, he would watch the Phare du Creach, one of the most powerful lighthouses in the world, and was fascinated by the stunning scenery repeated every night. &quot;Le Phare&quot;, which featured Claire Pichet, French singer and songwriter Dominique A, and Belgian drummer and percussionist Sacha Toorop, sold over 160,000 copies, confirming Tiersen&#x27;s status as one of the most innovative artists of his generation and commencing a run of successful albums. Three songs from this album, &quot;La Dispute&quot;, &quot;La Noyée&quot; and &quot;Sur le fil&quot; were later featured on the 2001 soundtrack &quot;Amélie&quot;, while &quot;L&#x27;Homme aux bras ballants&quot;, written and composed by Dominique A, was also featured on Laurent Gorgiard&#x27;s 1997 short animation soundtrack of the same name. Its single &quot;Monochrome&quot;, sung by Dominique A, was a radio hit and propelled the album into the charts. &quot;Le Phare&quot; was his first album to climb to number 50 in the French Albums Chart.

During that period, Tiersen provided a new arrangement and played strings, vibraphone, bell, the mandolin, the electric guitar and bass guitar for the song &quot;À ton étoile&quot; by French rock band Noir Désir which was featured on their 1998 remix album &quot;One Trip/One Noise&quot;. He recorded songs for the soundtrack of several films, including the award-winning and multi-nominated film &quot;The Dreamlife of Angels&quot; () (1998), André Téchiné&#x27;s &quot;Alice et Martin&quot; (1998) and Christine Carrière&#x27;s &quot;Qui plume la lune?&quot; (1999). Tiersen also recorded &quot;Bästard ~ Yann Tiersen&quot;, a three-track-extended-play released in 1998 in collaboration with French electronic rock band Bästard, and his first live album, &quot;Black Session: Yann Tiersen&quot;. The live album was recorded on 2 December 1998 as he played the opening act of the Rencontres Trans Musicales in the Salle Serreau at the Théâtre National de Bretagne in Rennes, for the &quot;C&#x27;est Lenoir&quot; French broadcast show on the public radio station France Inter. The album features the chamber pop group The Divine Comedy fronted by Northern Irish singer and songwriter Neil Hannon, the French rock band Noir Désir with singer and songwriter Bertrand Cantat, singer and illustrator Françoiz Breut, French rock band The Married Monk (Christian Quermalet, Philippe Lebruman, Etienne Jaumet, Nicolas Courret), French folk rock group Les Têtes Raides (Christian Olivier, Grègoire Simon, Pascal Olivier, Anne-Gaëlle Bisquay, Serge Bégout, Jean-Luc Millot, and Edith Bégou), the string quartet Quatuor à cordes, guitarist and composer Olivier Mellano, and author Mathieu Boogaerts, as well as his usual collaborators and friends, Claire Pichet and Dominique A. The album was recorded by France International, mastered by Radio France, and released in CD format one year later on 2 November 1999.

In 1999, Tiersen together with The Married Monk, Claire Pichet, and Olivier Mellano released his first collaboration album, &quot;Tout est calme&quot;. The 26 minutes, 10 tracks mini album peaked at number 45 on the French Albums Chart. The album produced one single, &quot;Les Grandes marées&quot;, and Tiersen also featured on The Divine Comedy&#x27;s single &quot;Gin Soaked Boy&quot; released on that same year, on three tracks for Françoiz Breut&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Vingt à Trente Mille Jours&quot; (English: Twenty to Thirty Thousand Days), and on Têtes Raides&#x27; &quot;Gratte-poil&quot;, both released in 2000.

===&quot;Amélie&quot; and global recognition: 2001–2009===
Tiersen remained relatively unknown outside France until the release of his score for the acclaimed film &quot;Amélie&quot; (Original French title: &quot;Le Fabuleux Destin d&#x27;Amélie Poulain&quot;, English: &quot;The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain&quot;) in 2001. French film director Jean-Pierre Jeunet had something else in mind for the film score, but one day one of his production assistants put on a CD of Tiersen, and the director found it absolutely superb. Jeunet bought all of Tiersen&#x27;s albums, and then contacted him to see if the Breton composer was interested in writing the film score for &quot;Amélie&quot;. In two weeks, Tiersen composed nineteen pieces for the film and also allowed the production to take anything they wanted from his other records. &quot;Amélie&quot; received great critical acclaim and was a box-office success. The film went on to win the Best Film award at the European Film Awards, four César Awards, including Best Film and Best Director, two BAFTA Awards, including Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated for five Academy Awards. The soundtrack was a mixture of both new and previously released material, and Tiersen was also the recipient of the César Award for Best Music Written for a Film, and of the World Soundtrack Academy award. The soundtrack album charted in many countries, including the number one position on the French Albums Chart.

While he was writing the film score for &quot;Amélie&quot;, Tiersen was also preparing his fifth studio album &quot;L&#x27;Absente&quot;. The album was characterized by several contributions including 35-member Ensemble Orchestral Synaxis conducted by Guillaume Bourgogne, viola player Bertrand Lambert, violinists Yann Bisquay and Sophie Naboulay, Natacha Régnier, and saxophonist Grégoire Simon, and long-time collaborators Dominique A, Christine Ott, Lisa Germano, Neil Hannon, Têtes Raides, Christian Quermalet, Marc Sens, and Sacha Toorop. The album, which was released on 5 June 2001 through EMI France, was preceded by two promotional singles for &quot;A quai&quot; and &quot;Bagatelle&quot; respectively. Tiersen provided strings and vibraphone to two tracks, &quot;Roma Amor&quot; and &quot;Holidays&quot;, featured on &quot;R/O/C/K/Y&quot;, the third studio album by The Married Monk.

At this time he was married to Belgian actress Natacha Régnier, co-star of &quot;The Dreamlife of Angels&quot;. Régnier became a singer and Tiersen wrote three songs for her including his arrangement of Georges Brassens&#x27; &quot;Le Parapluie&quot;, a song featured on the tribute album &quot;Les Oiseaux de passage&quot;, released in 2001. That same year they toured in France and abroad. They have a daughter, Lise, born in 2002, but Tiersen and Régnier have since divorced. In this period, Tiersen also took his music out around the world, playing shows with a full orchestra and an amplified string quartet. From 15 to 17 February 2002, Tiersen with many of the collaborators who participated in the recording sessions for &quot;L&#x27;Absente&quot; plus Claire Pichet, violinists Nicolas Stevens and Renaud Lhoest, bassist Jean-François Assy, viola player Olivier Tilkin, and uilleann pipes, bagpipes, and low whistle player Ronan Le Bars, performed live at the Cité de la Musique (&quot;City of Music&quot;) in Paris. Part of these three concerts went on to form Tiersen&#x27;s second live album &quot;C&#x27;était ici&quot; (&quot;It Was Here&quot;), which was released through EMI France on 30 September 2002.

Tiersen&#x27;s skills as a composer of film scores were much in demand, and the soundtrack for &quot;Amélie&quot; was soon followed by the film score for &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot;, a 2003 German Tragicomedy film directed by Wolfgang Becker. The film was both a commercial and a critical success and won several awards including the César Award for Best Film from the European Union, Best Film at the European Film Awards, the German Film Awards for Outstanding Film, Best European Film at the Goya Awards, Best Foreign Language Film for the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle, and it was also listed in the &quot;Empire&quot; magazine 2010&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;. Tiersen was the recipient of the German Film Awards for Outstanding Music. On 15 November 2003, Tiersen with Stuart A. Staples, the lead singer of indie band Tindersticks, actress and singer Jane Birkin, singer and songwriter Christophe Miossec, and Dominique A released &quot;3 titres inédits au profit de la FIDH&quot; (&quot;3 New Tracks for the Benefit of FIDH&quot;), a three-track CD that was part of the &quot;On Aime, On Aide&quot; benefit collection for raising funds for the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).
Tiersen&#x27;s list of collaborators continued to grow album after album and in October 2004 he released &quot;Yann Tiersen &amp; Shannon Wright&quot;, a collaboration album with American singer-songwriter Shannon Wright, and, in the same year, he is featured on The Divine Comedy&#x27;s album &quot;Absent Friends&quot;. In 2005, Tiersen released his fifth studio album &quot;Les Retrouvailles&quot;. The album features several collaborators including the Orchestre National de Paris, singers Elizabeth Fraser, Jane Birkin, Stuart A. Staples, Dominique A, and Miossec, strings players Jean-François Assy, Frederic Dessus, Guillaume Fontanarosa, Bertrand Causse, Anne Causse Biragnet, Armelle Legoff, Frédéric Haffner, flute player Elliott, drummer Ludovic Morillon, and ondes Martenot player Christine Ott. &quot;Les Retrouvailles&quot; also includes a DVD short film entitled &quot;La Traversée&quot;, directed by Aurélie du Boys, which documents the making of the album in Ushant, and incorporates an animated video for the non-album track &quot;Le Train&quot; and live versions of a handful of songs. The album produced a single, &quot;Kala&quot;, sung by Elizabeth Fraser, and Tiersen also played piano on Staples&#x27; solo debut album, &quot;Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04&quot;. The subsequent world tour of 2006 replaced the multi-instrumental ensemble with electric guitars and an ondes Martenot, and produced his third live album, &quot;On Tour&quot;, which was released together with a DVD, directed by Aurélie du Boys, about the tour, in November 2006. In 2006, he also released two singles, &quot;La Mancha&quot; and &quot;La Rade&quot;, and he was featured on &quot;The Endless Rise of the Sun&quot;, the third studio album by electronic group Smooth, &quot;Raides à la ville&quot; extended play by Katel, and &quot;13m²&quot; by David Delabrosse.

After a five-year absence as a composer of film scores, Tiersen provided the background music for &quot;Tabarly&quot;, a 2008 documentary film by Pierre Marcel about the French sailor, two-time champion of the Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, and father of French yachting Éric Tabarly. The documentary was released in June 2008, exactly ten years after Tabarly&#x27;s death. Éric Tabarly was lost on the night of 12–13 June 1998 in the Irish Sea when he was struck by a gaff of his Pen Duick during heavy swell and knocked overboard from his yacht near Wales while on his way to the Fife Regatta in Scotland. His body was recovered five weeks later off the coast of Ireland by a French fishing trawler. The documentary, narrated by Tabarly himself, traces his sporting career until his last meal in Ushant. Before the end of the decade, Tiersen also contributed to Christine Ott&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Solitude Nomade&quot;, and to Miossec&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Finistériens&quot;.

===&quot;Dust Lane&quot; and &quot;Skyline&quot;: 2010–present===

October 2010 saw the release of Tiersen&#x27;s sixth studio album titled &quot;Dust Lane&quot;. The album was two years in the making and was largely recorded in Ushant, France. Further parts were recorded in the Philippines. The album is preoccupied with mortality; during the recording sessions Tiersen lost his mother and a close friend. The recordings started out as simple song based tracks with Tiersen playing acoustic guitar, mandolin and bouzouki. New layers were added to the recordings creating a more complex sound. Then an array of vintage synthesisers and electric guitars were added to create further textures. The album was released by Mute Records in Europe and ANTI- Records in the US. The record was promoted in a tour beginning in October 2010, starting in New York City. &quot;Dust Lane&quot; was preceded by the release of the vinyl EP &quot;PALESTINE&quot; and by the single for &quot;Ashes&quot;. In 2010, Tiersen also contributed to the tribute album to cross-genre, experimental music group Coil &quot;The Dark Age of Love&quot; by This Immortal Coil, a one-off tribute formation, and to &quot;Li(f)e&quot;, the fourth solo studio album by hip-hop artist Sage Francis.

October 2011 saw the European release of his seventh studio album, &quot;Skyline&quot;. The nine-track album, a follow on from his &quot;Dust Lane&quot;, was once again recorded at Tiersen&#x27;s home on the island of Ushant in the south-western end of the English Channel, with further parts recorded in Paris, San Francisco, Berlin, and Nashville. It was subsequently mixed by producer Ken Thomas in Leeds, and mastered by Ray Staff in London. The album produced the singles for &quot;Monuments&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Live Anyhow&quot;. On 18 February 2012, Tiersen with Lionel Laquerriere, and Thomas Poli, presented his side project, Elektronische Staubband, at La Route du Rock music festival in Saint-Malo. It was about an hour of krautrock, electronic, and experimental music involving a dozen of synthesizers and analog keyboards with the first three pieces of the set list taken from &quot;Dust Lane&quot; and the remaining five from &quot;Skyline&quot;. Tiersen was also chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in March 2012 in Minehead, England. &quot;Skyline&quot; was released in North America via ANTI- Records on 17 April 2012, and it was followed by the &quot;Skyline Tour&quot; with dates in the United States, Canada, Iceland, Spain, Portugal, France, Slovak Republic, Austria, Finland and the United Kingdom.

On 3 August 2016, it was announced that Tiersen married Emilie Quinquis in Ushant, Brittany. Quinquis stated that she and Tiersen were married on 31 July 2016. On 6 April 2017 they gave birth to a son.

==Music==
===Styles and instruments===
Tiersen&#x27;s music is influenced by the classical training he received as a child, by American and British punk subculture, and by the music he used to listen to as a teenager. His musical style is deceptively easy to recognize but difficult to define. It varies greatly from one album to another and with time. His melancholic music and composing techniques mix classical and folk music elements with pop and rock ones. His delicate but deeply emotional style has been linked to Frédéric Chopin and the other great masters of Romantic music, and also to Erik Satie, the colourful figure of the early 20th century Parisian avant-garde whose work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, repetitive music, and the Theatre of the Absurd. Tiersen is also compared to one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century, the American minimalism, classical–contemporary classical, and ambient music composer Philip Glass, and to British minimalist music composer, pianist, librettist and musicologist Michael Nyman, known for the many film scores he wrote during his lengthy career and who is the reason for Tiersen to be often called the Gallic Michael Nyman.
Tiersen started playing the piano and the violin at a young age. In 1983, at the age of thirteen, he broke his violin and bought an electric guitar. Tiersen only returned to his beginnings instrument years later, after searching for string sounds to sample. For his music albums, Tiersen composes and makes arrangements incorporating many instruments, including keyboards such as the piano, electric piano, Fender Rhodes, organs, harpsichord, Bontempi and toy pianos, Korg and Moog synthesizers, Mellotron, piano accordions and melodica, strings as the violin, viola, violone and the cello, different types of electric, acoustic or bass guitars, mandolin, banjo, ukulele, bouzouki and oud, brasses, like horns, and woodwind instruments such as the saxophone, clarinet, bassoon, pipe, oboe and the flute, percussions like drums, vibraphone, marimba, tubular bells, tom drum, cymbal, glockenspiel and tam-tam, or the sounds produced by Leslie speaker, music box, carillons, typewriters, cooking vessels, chairs, a car or a bicycle wheel. Tiersen plays all of these instruments himself either in the studio or on a live set.

===Film scores===
Tiersen&#x27;s ability to compose music that can be easily used for film scores was evident from the beginning. All tracks from his debut album, &quot;La Valse des monstres&quot;, were conceived for stage adaptations and plays. The title track of his second album, &quot;Rue des cascades&quot;, was used for &quot;The Dreamlife of Angels&quot; by Erick Zonca, and several tracks from both albums plus three songs from &quot;Le Phare&quot; are featured on the soundtrack to Jean-Pierre Jeunet&#x27;s film &quot;Amélie&quot;. Another track form &quot;Le Phare&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Homme aux bras ballants&quot;, is the soundtrack to a short animation film by Laurent Gorgiard. Tiersen&#x27;s pieces are also featured on &quot;Alice et Martin&quot; by André Téchiné, and &quot;Qui plume la lune?&quot; by Christine Carrière.

Following the box-office success of &quot;Amélie&quot;, Tiersen&#x27;s skills as a composer of film scores were much in demand, and this led him to compose the music for &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; by Wolfgang Becker. Although the soundtrack for &quot;Amélie&quot; consisted mainly of pieces that Tiersen had previously released on his first two albums, the soundtrack for &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; was conceived from scratch, except for &quot;Comptine d&#x27;un autre été : L&#x27;après-midi&quot;, which is also featured on &quot;Amélie&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack.

Tiersen returned to making film soundtracks in 2008 after a years-long break, creating the score for a documentary about the sailor Éric Tabarly.

===Collaborations===
Tiersen has always composed his music in solitude, starting from simple melodies to which he added subsequent layers. His first album, &quot;La Valse des monstres&quot;, is almost entirely performed by him alone playing all the instruments, with the exception of &quot;Quimper 94&quot; and &quot;Le Banquet&quot; with drums and charleston provided by Laurent Heudes. His second album, &quot;Rue des cascades&quot;, saw the participation of French soloist singer Claire Pichet, who provided vocals on two tracks on the album, &quot;Rue des cascades&quot; and &quot;Naomi&quot;, and François-Xavier Schweyer, who played cello on &quot;C&#x27;était ici&quot; and &quot;La Fenêtre&quot;. &quot;Le Phare&quot; saw his first collaboration with French singer and songwriter Dominique A. Claire Pichet and drummer Sacha Toorop are also featured on this album, but both albums can be considered as a one-man works.

It is at this point in his career, around the end of the nineties, that his collaborations begin to grow. In 1997, he collaborated with French rock band Noir Désir, the following year Tiersen and Dominique A released the single for &quot;Monochrome&quot;, and, in collaboration with French electronic rock band Bästard, the EP &quot;Bästard ~ Yann Tiersen&quot;, while 1999 saw the releases of &quot;Tout est calme&quot;, a collaboration mini album by Yann Tiersen, The Married Monk, Claire Pichet, and Olivier Mellano, and of his first live album, &quot;Black Session: Yann Tiersen&quot;. The live album, recorded in December 1998, features Tiersen with Claire Pichet, Dominique A, The Divine Comedy&#x27;s singer and songwriter Neil Hannon, Noir Désir&#x27;s singer and songwriter Bertrand Cantat, singer and illustrator Françoiz Breut, anglophone French rock band The Married Monk, French folk rock group Têtes Raides, the string quartet Quatuor à cordes, guitarist and composer Olivier Mellano, and author Mathieu Boogaerts. The soundtrack for &quot;Amélie&quot; saw for the first time the introduction of a full orchestra, the 35-member Ensemble Orchestral Synaxis, and of an ondes Martenot played by Christine Ott. Both will participate in the recording sessions for his next album, &quot;L&#x27;Absente&quot;, which also includes American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Lisa Germano, Belgian actress and singer Natacha Régnier, Neil Hannon, and Têtes Raides, among others.

Tiersen&#x27;s list of collaborators continues to grow. His second live album, &quot;C&#x27;était ici&quot;, recorded during three concerts performed in February 2002 at the Cité de la Musique in Paris, features more than 50 musicians. &quot;Yann Tiersen &amp; Shannon Wright&quot;, a collaboration album with American singer and songwriter Shannon Wright, was released in October 2004, and his 2005 album, &quot;Les Retrouvailles&quot;, features vocals from Stuart Staples of Tindersticks, English actress and singer Jane Birkin, Breton singer and songwriter Miossec, Elizabeth Fraser, the vocalist for the pioneer alternative rock group Cocteau Twins, and the Orchestre National de Paris. The subsequent world tour produced his third live album &quot;On Tour&quot;, which replaced the multi-instrumental ensemble of &quot;Les Retrouvailles&quot; with a more rock-oriented sound. The soundtrack to &quot;Tabarly&quot; saw Tiersen return to minimalism, in fact most of the compositions featured on the album are for solo piano. But his two subsequent albums return to have a rock-oriented sound, with the only difference that &quot;Skyline&quot; has a higher number of contributors than &quot;Dust Lane&quot;.

Tiersen has contributed, either in part or in full, to the realization of several records among which stand out &quot;Gin Soaked Boy&quot; and &quot;Absent Friends&quot; by The Divine Comedy, &quot;Vingt à Trente Mille Jours&quot; by Françoiz Breut, &quot;Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04&quot; by Stuart A. Staples, and &quot;Li(f)e&quot; by Sage Francis, as well as records by Noir Désir, Têtes Raides, The Married Monk, French electronic trio Smooth, Katel, David Delabrosse, Christine Ott, or Miossec. In 2011, Tiersen, with Lionel Laquerriere and Thomas Poli, has also started Elektronische Staubband, a side project on electronic music. This new project is expected to lead to the release of a new album in 2013.

===Charity work===
In 2011, Tiersen collaborated with the Yellow Bird Project (YBP) to design a t-shirt, which was sold to raise money for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The main reason he chose to support MSF, is for their work as one of the three charities helping refugees in Libya at the time. A live video session was also filmed in the MSF London offices to promote the T-shirt and raise awareness for the cause.

<text>The makhaira is a type of Ancient Greek bladed weapon and tool, generally a large knife or sword, similar in appearance to the modern day machete, with a single cutting edge.

== Terminology ==

The Greek word μάχαιρα (&quot;mákhaira&quot;, plural &quot;mákhairai&quot;), also transliterated &quot;machaira&quot; or &quot;machaera,&quot; is related to (&quot;mákhē&quot;) &quot;a battle&quot;, (&quot;mákhesthai&quot;) &quot;to fight&quot;. It derives from the Proto-Indo-European *&quot;magh-.&quot; 

Homer mentions the makhaira, but as a domestic knife of no great size. In period texts, μάχαιρα has a variety of meanings, and can refer to virtually any knife or sword, even a surgeon&#x27;s scalpel, but in a martial context it frequently refers to a type of one-edged sword; a sword designed primarily to cut rather than thrust.

The Koine of the New Testament uses the word &quot;makhaira&quot; to refer to a sword generically, not making any particular distinction between native blades and the gladius of the Roman soldier. This ambiguity appears to have contributed to the apocryphal &quot;malchus&quot;, a supposedly short curved sword used by Peter to cut off the ear of a slave named Malchus during the arrest of Jesus. While such a weapon clearly is a &quot;makhaira&quot; by ancient definition, the imprecise nature of the word as used in the New Testament cannot provide any conclusive answer. 

&quot;Makhaira&quot; entered classical Latin as &quot;machaera&quot;, &quot;a sword&quot;. The dimachaerus was a type of Roman gladiator that fought with two swords. In modern Greek, means &quot;knife&quot;.

Modern scholars distinguish the makhaira from the kopis (an ancient term of similar meaning) based on whether the blade is forward curved (kopis), or not (makhaira).

== Characteristics == 

Makhaira were of various sizes and shapes, being regional, and not exclusively Greek. Greek art shows the Lacedaemonian and Persian armies employing swords with a single cutting edge, but Persian records show that their primary infantry sword was two edged and straight, similar to the Greek xiphos (cf. acinaces). Greek vase painting begins to show makhairai very infrequently from , though their depiction is increasingly common on &#x27;red figure&#x27; ceramics 
from onwards. 

The makhaira depicted in artworks was single-edged, having an expanded convex portion to the cutting part of the blade towards its tip. This concentrated weight, therefore momentum, to this part of the blade; facilitating particularly forceful cuts. The shape of the blade allowed the makhaira the potential to cut through bone.

Despite their relatively frequent depictions in art, archaeological remains of this type of sword are rare.

== Use ==

While Xenophon states that the xiphos was the conventional sword used by the Greek soldier of his time, he recommended the makhaira for cavalry. &quot;I recommend a &quot;kopis&quot; rather than a &quot;xiphos&quot;, because from the height of a horse&#x27;s back the cut of a &quot;machaira&quot; will serve you better than the thrust of a &quot;xiphos.&quot;&quot; (Xenophon, 12:11). Archeological evidence suggests that the makhaira was more predominant in areas that were not so focused on using the phalanx, and instead focused more on cavalry. 

His reasoning concurs with the general practice of arming cavalry with cutting swords through the ages. Greek art along with Xenophon&#x27;s further commentary suggests that the sword he intended for the cavalry was wider than the more modern sabre; more akin to the falchion or even machete.

<doc id="940401" wikidata="Q2713506" url="?curid=940401" title="Tomba!">
<text>Tomba! is a 1997 action-adventure platform video game developed and published by Whoopee Camp for the PlayStation. It was released in Japan in 1997 and internationally by Sony Computer Entertainment the following year. The game centers on the eponymous feral child as he attempts to recover his grandfather&#x27;s bracelet from an evil race of anthropomorphic pigs.

Creator Tokuro Fujiwara developed &quot;Tomba!&quot; after leaving Capcom in 1995, founding Whoopee Camp as director, producer and lead designer. He chose the game&#x27;s 2D side-scrolling perspective for the format&#x27;s straightforward nature, and created a non-linear &quot;event&quot; system to differentiate the game from other platforming titles. 

&quot;Tomba!&quot; was received positively by critics, with praise for its controls, visuals, and varied gameplay objectives. However, the game&#x27;s audio received a more mixed reception. Despite the game&#x27;s lackluster commercial performance, it was followed by a sequel in 1999, &quot;Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return&quot;. &quot;Tomba!&quot; maintained a cult following years after its debut, and was re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2011. Limited Run Games released an enhanced version for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Windows in 2024, with a PlayStation 4 version releasing in the future.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tomba!&quot; is an open world Metroidvania game with RPG elements. The player controls the titular character Tomba, who must explore his home island, defeat the evil Koma Pigs and recover his grandfather&#x27;s golden bracelet. Most of the game takes place in a side-scrolling perspective. However, Tomba can occasionally climb over walls to move between the foreground and background as separate areas. Some areas allow the player to explore them in an isometric view. Along with the ability to jump, Tomba can attack enemy characters by leaping onto and biting into their back before tossing them in a straightforward trajectory. Tomba can also attack enemies by obtaining various weapons, such as flails and boomerangs. Signposts scattered throughout the environment state how to use the game&#x27;s controls and abilities, while a select few can be used to save the player&#x27;s progress.

When Tomba interacts with a certain character or environmental element, an &quot;event&quot; may be initiated, in which Tomba is given a task to accomplish or an obstacle to overcome. Such events may consist of finding a lost item, rescuing a stranded character or clearing a blockade in the imminent path. Upon completing an event, the player is rewarded with &quot;Adventure Points&quot;, which can be used to access additional events and unlock specifically-marked chests. Multiple events can be undertaken at once and often do not require being cleared in any specific order. The game features an inventory system that displays the player&#x27;s current collection of items and events. The game includes a total of 130 events.

The player begins the game with a maximum of four &quot;vitality points&quot; that are represented as a series of yellow bars on the upper-left corner of the screen. Tomba loses a vitality point if he is hit by an enemy, touches a sharp object, or falls into deep water. Vitality points can be restored by eating fruit. When all vitality points are depleted or if Tomba falls down a bottomless chasm, the player loses a life. If all lives are lost, the game ends prematurely.

==Plot==
Years ago on an uncharted archipelago, a group known as the Seven Evil Pigs appeared and used their magical powers to tarnish the land. Their underlings, the Koma Pigs, began terrorizing the populace with their mischievous pranks. Years later, a curious and energetic boy named Tomba diligently protects his grandfather&#x27;s grave and wears a gold bracelet as an heirloom. One day, Tomba&#x27;s bracelet is stolen following a confrontation with a group of Koma Pigs. He pursues them to a nearby village, where he is directed to the 100-Year-Old Wise Man. The Wise Man tells the story of the Seven Evil Pigs&#x27; rise to power, and reveals that the Koma Pigs are stockpiling gold. He advises Tomba to find his bracelet by hunting the seven Evil Pigs hiding throughout the land. He also describes the Evil Pig Bags that could reveal the Pigs&#x27; hiding places, and suggests learning more from the Dwarf Elder in the next village. The Dwarf Elder gives Tomba a blue Pig Bag and tells him that the Bags can reveal the entrance to an Evil Pig&#x27;s hideout if Tomba approaches it. However, he warns that the individual Evil Pigs do not hide in the same area where they have cast their spell. Tomba explores the continent and gathers the rest of the Pig Bags. In the midst of his travels, an older Wise Man informs Tomba that the gold being hoarded by the Seven Evil Pigs is the source of their power. After Tomba captures the Seven Evil Pigs and lifts their spells over the land, an eighth Evil Pig Bag manifests within his possession and reveals the lair of the Evil Pigs&#x27; creator and leader, the Real Evil Pig. After defeating the Real Evil Pig in his trove of gold, Tomba recovers his bracelet and leaves it resting upon his grandfather&#x27;s grave.

==Development==
&quot;Tomba!&quot; was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who left Capcom in December 1995 after 13 years as an employee. Fujiwara&#x27;s motivation stemmed from a desire to create new and original games, which he felt he was unable to do within Capcom. Upon exhausting his accumulated vacation days, Fujiwara resigned immediately following the release of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. Fujiwara soon established the independent development studio Whoopee Camp, and became the director, producer and lead designer of the studio&#x27;s debut game &quot;Tomba!&quot;.

Fujiwara chose to make a side-scrolling game as he believed this fundamental experience would excite players in a straightforward way. To distinguish &quot;Tomba!&quot; from other action games, Fujiwara designed a non-linear event system, as well as Tomba&#x27;s gradual growth in abilities and resources. &quot;Tomba!&quot;″s score was composed by Fujiwara&#x27;s longtime Capcom collaborator Harumi Fujita, who eagerly approached Fujiwara for a position upon learning of Whoopee Camp&#x27;s establishment. The game&#x27;s Japanese version features the song &quot;Paradise&quot; by Tokyo Channel Q as its opening theme, and &quot;Que Serã Serã&quot; by Fumitaka Fuchigami as the ending theme.

==Release==
&quot;Tomba!&quot; was released in Japan on December 25, 1997. Promotional plush figures of Tomba and a Koma Pig were distributed in limited quantities around the game&#x27;s original release date. The figures were also offered as prizes in a sweepstake run by &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; in 1999.

The international publishing rights for &quot;Tomba!&quot; were given to Sony Computer Entertainment. &quot;Tomba!&quot; was released in North America on July 16, 1998 and in Europe on August 28, 1998. The international release was improved, with shorter load times, more responsive controls, Gouraud shading on background elements, and other visual improvements. The intro theme &quot;Paradise&quot; was retained for the American release, but with the vocals removed. The game is titled &quot;Tombi!&quot; in European territories; Erik Engström of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; speculated that the change was motivated by the fact that &quot;tomba&quot; is an Italian word meaning &quot;grave&quot;. The opening theme for the European version is &quot;No Sweat&quot; by North &amp; South, which was also used as the theme song of the television series of the same name.

&quot;Tomba!&quot; was re-released on the PlayStation Network in Japan on July 6, 2011. Distributor MonkeyPaw Games spent one year formulating an English-language distribution deal with Sony and Fujiwara. The English-language version of &quot;Tomba!&quot; was re-released on the PlayStation Network in North America on June 19, 2012 and in Europe on October 3, 2012. The deal between MonkeyPaw Games, Sony and Fujiwara did not initially include the game&#x27;s sequel, and the involved parties elected to wait until &quot;Tomba!&quot;″s re-release showed satisfactory sales figures before arranging the sequel&#x27;s re-release. In the month of its North American debut, &quot;Tomba!&quot; was the third best-selling PSOne Classic.

On July 12, 2023, Limited Run Games announced they would be working with Fujiwara to release an enhanced version of &quot;Tomba!&quot; on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Windows. The new version will run on Limited Run Games&#x27; Carbon Engine and feature a new soundtrack by Fujita. The soundtrack for the enhanced version is arranged from the original compositions Fujita created on the synthesizer as opposed to the tracks from the PlayStation version, which used sampled audio. The enhanced version, titled &quot;Tomba! Special Edition&quot;, was released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and Steam on August 1, 2024, with a PlayStation 4 release to follow later.

==Reception==
&quot;Tomba!&quot; received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 31 out of 40.

The events were praised for their variety, quantity, and non-linearity. Mark Cooke of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; noted that &quot;Tomba!&quot; was the first platform game to grant such freedom, following attempts by RPGs such as &quot;The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall&quot;. However, John Ricciardi of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and Joe Rybicki of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; warned that the overlapping events may easily result in players getting sidetracked. The game&#x27;s side-scrolling segments were considered reminiscent of platform games from earlier generations, particularly Fujiwara&#x27;s past titles &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; and &quot;Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;. Cooke, however, felt that the lack of innovation made the gameplay &quot;a little too tired&quot;. Several reviewers praised the responsiveness of the controls. Rybicki cited the high amount of load times as a negative point, and John Broady of &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the limited save system as a &quot;chore&quot;, suggesting that a system that saves the game after each event would have been more logical.

The game&#x27;s visuals were lauded for their bright and colorful presentation, smooth character animation, and combination of 2D character sprites and 3D polygonal environments. Crispin Boyer of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; compared the game&#x27;s visuals to &quot;&quot;, particularly in the &quot;almost perfect marriage&quot; of its disparate graphical elements. Cooke described the hand-drawn cutscenes as endearing and humorous, and regarded the introduction to be the game&#x27;s best feature. All four reviewers for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; appreciated the game&#x27;s eccentric and lightly humorous tone, as did Rybicki, who found the game refreshing after a glut of post-apocalyptic three-dimensional third-person shooters at E3 1998. Erik Engström of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; saw influences by various anime from the late 1970s and early 1980s; he compared the game&#x27;s rural and fantastical setting and occasional scatological references to Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, and compared the Koma Pigs to the &quot;Yatterman&quot; character Odate Buta.

Reactions to the audio were more mixed. Some were impressed by the soundtrack and considered it catchy, with Cooke declaring that the game &quot;may set a new high water mark for platformers.&quot; Others were more apathetic, with Bro Buzz of &quot;GamePro&quot; finding the sound effects &quot;minimal to an extreme&quot; and claiming that the music was &quot;limited to one catchy but repetitive, goofy tune&quot;.

==Sequel==

Despite &quot;Tomba!&quot;″s positive critical reception, its commercial performance proved lukewarm; the game did not sell enough copies to qualify for inclusion in Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits, although it sold well enough to justify a sequel. Whoopee Camp released &quot;Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return&quot; for the PlayStation in 1999, and the game was also met with positive reviews. However, it sold less than its predecessor and Whoopee Camp disbanded after its release. &quot;Tomba!&quot; later garnered a cult following.

<text>Luther is a small lunar impact crater on the northwest part of Mare Serenitatis, at the inlet to Lacus Somniorum. To the east-southeast is the large crater Posidonius. Luther has a circular rim and is cup-shaped, with no appreciable wear from impact erosion. It lies across a wrinkle ridge on the lunar mare.

The crater is named after German astronomer Robert Luther.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Luther.

<text>Albert von Kölliker (born Rudolf Albert Kölliker&quot;;&quot; 6 July 1817 – 2 November 1905) was a Swiss anatomist, physiologist, and histologist.

==Biography==
Albert Kölliker was born in Zürich, Switzerland. His early education was carried on in Zürich, and he entered the university there in 1836. After two years, however, he moved to the University of Bonn, and later to that of Berlin, becoming a pupil of noted physiologists Johannes Peter Müller and of Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle. He graduated in philosophy at Zürich in 1841, and in medicine at Heidelberg in 1842 The first academic post which he held was that of prosector of anatomy under Henle, but his tenure of this office was briefin 1844 he returned to University of Zurich to occupy a chair as professor extraordinary of physiology and comparative anatomy. His stay here was also brief; in 1847 the University of Würzburg, attracted by his rising fame, offered him the post of professor of physiology and of microscopical and comparative anatomy. He accepted the appointment, and at Würzburg he remained thenceforth, refusing all offers tempting him to leave the quiet academic life of the Bavarian town, where he died.

Many of the numerous memoirs which he published, (including the very first paper he wrote) and which appeared in 1841, before he graduated, were on the structure of animals of the most varied kinds. Notable among these were his papers on the &quot;Medusae&quot; and allied creatures. His activity in this direction led him to make zoological excursions to the Mediterranean Sea and to the coasts of Scotland, as well as to undertake, conjointly with his friend Carl Theodor Ernst von Siebold, the editorship of the &quot;Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Zoologie&quot;, which, founded in 1848, continued under his hands to be one of the most important zoological periodicals.

His hand was one of the first to be x-rayed, by his friend Wilhelm Röntgen.

==Works==
Kölliker made contributions to the study of zoology. His earlier efforts were directed to the invertebrates, and his memoir on the development of cephalopods (which appeared in 1844) is considered a classical work. He soon passed on to the vertebrates, and studied the amphibians and mammalian embryos. He was among the first, if not the very first, to introduce into this branch of biological inquiry the newer microscopic technique – the methods of hardening, sectioning and staining. Much of the progress which embryology made during the middle and latter half of the 19th century are associated with his name. His &quot;Lectures on Development&quot;, published in 1861, at once became a standard work.

But neither zoology nor embryology furnished Kölliker&#x27;s chief claim to fame. If he did much for these branches of science, he did still more for histology, the knowledge of the minute structure of the animal tissues. Among his earlier results was the demonstration in 1847 that smooth or unstriated muscle is made up of distinct units, of nucleated muscle cells. In this work, he followed in the footsteps of his master Henle. A few years before this, there was doubt whether arteries had muscle in their walls – in addition, no solid histological basis as yet existed for those views as to the action of the nervous system on the circulation, which were soon to be put forward, and which had such a great influence on the progress of physiology.

Kölliker&#x27;s contributions to histology were widespread; smooth muscle, striated muscle, skin, bone, teeth, blood vessels and viscera were all investigated by Kölliker. The results at which he arrived were recorded partly in separate memoirs, partly in his great textbook on microscopical anatomy, which first saw the light in 1850.

Albert L. Lehninger asserted that Kölliker was among the first to notice the arrangement of granules in the sarcoplasm of striated muscle over a period of years beginning around 1850. These granules were later called sarcosomes by Retzius in 1890. These sarcosomes have come to be known as the mitochondria-the power houses of the cell. In the words of Lehninger, &quot;Kölliker should also be credited with the first separation of mitochondria from cell structure. In 1888 he teased these granules from insect muscle, in which they are very profuse, found them to swell in water, and showed them to possess a membrane.&quot;

In the case of almost every tissue, our present knowledge contains information first discovered by Kölliker – it is for his work on the nervous system that his name is most remembered. As early as 1845, while still at Zürich, he supplied a clear proof that nerve fibers are continuous with nerve cells, and laying the groundwork for all later research as to the actions of the central nervous system.

From that time onward he continually laboured at the histology of the nervous system, and more especially at the difficult problems presented by the intricate patterns in which nerve fibers and neurons are woven together in the brain and spinal cord. From his early days a master of method, he saw at a glance the value of the new Golgi staining method for the investigation of the central nervous system. Kölliker contributed greatly to knowledge of the inner structure of the brain. In 1889, he reproduces the histological preparations of the father of neuroscience Ramón y Cajal and confirmed the theory of neuronism.

==Honors==
Kölliker was ennobled by prince regent Luitpold of Bavaria in 1897 and thus permitted to add the predicate &quot;von&quot; to his surname. He was made a member of the learned societies of many countries; in England, which he visited more than once, and where he became well known, the Royal Society made him a fellow in 1860, and in 1897 gave him its highest token of esteem, the Copley medal.

A species of lizard, &quot;Hyalosaurus koellikeri&quot;, is named in his honor.


==Heterogenesis==
In 1864 Kölliker revived Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s theory that evolution proceeds by large steps (saltationism), under the name of heterogenesis. Kölliker was a critic of Darwinism and rejected a universal common ancestor, instead he supported a theory of common descent along separate lines. According to Alexander Vucinich the non-Darwinian evolution theory of Kölliker tied &quot;organic transformism to three general ideas, all contrary to Darwin&#x27;s view: the multiple origin of living forms, the internal causes of variation, and &quot;sudden leaps&quot; (heterogenesis) in the evolutionary process.&quot;
Kölliker claimed that heterogenesis functioned according to a general law of evolutionary progress, orthogenesis.

<text>William Robert Poage (December 28, 1899 – January 3, 1987) was a Texas politician who won election to the United States House of Representatives 21 times, serving 41 years.

==Early life and education==

William Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Poage was born in Waco, Texas to William Allen and Helen Wheeler (Née Conger) and was raised near Woodson. He attended the schools of Throckmorton County, and during World War I served as an apprentice seaman in the United States Navy. He attended the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Colorado Boulder before receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Baylor University in 1921. He farmed and taught geology at Baylor before attending Baylor Law School, from which he received his LL.B. in 1924. Poage practiced law in Waco and taught at Baylor Law.

==Political career==

A Democrat, he served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1925 to 1929, and the Texas State Senate from 1931 to 1937.

In 1936, Poage was elected to the House of Representatives. He was later diagnosed with Ménière&#x27;s disease, which eventually left him deaf in one ear. In the House, he supported acts designed to help the rural residents of his district. He supported the farm price supports of the Roosevelt Administration, and worked to keep farmers prosperous. Poage was the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture from 1967 to 1975, until he was removed from his position in a revolt by House Democratic Caucus against the Seniority system. The Caucus considered Poage to be too conservative and he was replaced by Tom Foley (D-WA), a future Speaker of the House.

He was one of the majority of the Texan delegation to decline to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. However, Poage voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And, when lobbied by the Johnson administration to support the War on Poverty legislation for the opportunities and services it would provide, Poage responded, &quot;Oh, I see! You&#x27;re talking&#x27; about the niggers!&quot; 

==Retirement and death==

Poage did not run for re-election in 1978 and retired on December 31, 1978, 4 days before the official end of his 21st term in office. He returned to his home in Waco, Texas. The following year the W. R. Poage Legislative Library for Graduate Studies and Research was dedicated on the Baylor University Campus to house Poage&#x27;s congressional papers and the papers of eight other former U. S. Congressmen. On January 3, 1987, he died of heart failure at 87 years old after receiving open heart surgery.

<text>1024 is the natural number following 1023 and preceding 1025.

1024 is a power of two: 2 (2 to the tenth power). It is the nearest power of two from decimal 1000 and senary 10000 (decimal 1296). It is the 64th quarter square.

1024 is the smallest number with exactly 11 divisors (but there are smaller numbers with more than 11 divisors; e.g., 60 has 12 divisors) .

== Enumeration of groups ==
The number of groups of order 1024 is , up to isomorphism. An earlier calculation gave this number as , but in 2021 this was shown to be in error.

This count is more than 99% of all the isomorphism classes of groups of order less than 2000.

== Approximation to 1000 ==

The neat coincidence that 210 is nearly equal to 103 provides the basis of a technique of estimating larger powers of 2 in decimal notation. Using 210&quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot; ≈ 2&quot;b&quot;103&quot;a&quot;(or 2a≈2a mod 1010floor(a/10) if &quot;a&quot; stands for the whole power) is fairly accurate for exponents up to about 100. For exponents up to 300, 3&quot;a&quot; continues to be a good estimate of the number of digits.

For example, 253 ≈ 8×1015. The actual value is closer to 9×1015.

In the case of larger exponents, the relationship becomes increasingly inaccurate, with errors exceeding an order of magnitude for &quot;a&quot; ≥ 97. For example:

:formula_1

In measuring bytes, 1024 is often used in place of 1000 as the quotients of the units byte, kilobyte, megabyte, etc. In 1999, the IEC coined the term kibibyte for multiples of 1024, with kilobyte being used for multiples of 1000.

== Special use in computers ==
In binary notation, 1024 is represented as 10000000000, making it a simple round number occurring frequently in computer applications.

1024 is the maximum number of computer memory addresses that can be referenced with ten binary switches. This is the origin of the organization of computer memory into 1024-byte chunks or kibibytes.

In the Rich Text Format (RTF), language code 1024 indicates the text is not in any language and should be skipped over when proofing. Most used languages codes in RTF are integers slightly over 1024.

1024×768 pixels and 1280×1024 pixels are common standards of display resolution.

1024 is the lowest non-system and non-reserved port number in TCP/IP networking. Ports above this number can usually be opened for listening by non-superusers.

<text>FC Amkar Perm ( ) is a professional football club. Originally founded in 1994, it is based in the city of Perm. It was a participant in second-tier football from 1995 and in the Russian Premier League from 2004 to 2018, after which it was dissolved. Amkar&#x27;s home stadium was the Zvezda Stadium.

In August 2020, it was re-established by the Government of the Perm Krai as an amateur club, and became professional the following year.

==History==

===1994–1999. Third and Second Leagues===
The Amkar football club was created to represent the Perm Inorganic Fertilizer Company. The club&#x27;s &quot;birthday&quot; is 8 May 1993, although it was only registered officially on 6 December 1994. The name &quot;Amkar&quot; derives from a combination of parts of the Russian words &quot;AMmiak&quot; (ammonia) and &quot;KARbamid (carbamide, urea) – these two substances being the main products of the plant. The team owes the choice of club colours (red and black) to its Italian trade partners from the city of Milan, who responded to a request for help by offering equipment from A.C. Milan. And so the club colours became red and black. The basis of the new team was made up of company employees. In 1994, Amkar, strengthened by amateur players from other city teams and a few former professionals, became champion of the city of Perm and the Perm region and also won the regional Cup. The club was officially registered on 6 December 1994 and applied to participate in the Russian football league. Amkar was included in the third league of the Russian Championship.

In 1995, the team, reinforced by former players of Zvezda Perm, was second in the sixth group of the third league and qualified for the second league. In 1996, Amkar finished in third place in the central group of the second league and in 1997, the club was second in the tournament.
On 12 September 1998, Spartak Moscow paid a visit to Amkar for a Russian Cup tie. Spartak&#x27;s previous visit to the Western Urals was in 1977 as a first division side, when they were close to a return to the top tier of domestic football. The match attracted enormous interest and the 25,000-capacity stadium was filled to capacity for the first time in its 30-year history. The match finished 1–0 in favour of Amkar. In the league, &quot;Permyaki&quot; accumulated 93% of the possible number of points and scored 100 goals. Amkar took first place and earned the right to play in the First Division.

===1999–2004. First Division===
From 1999 to 2003, the team performed reasonably well in the First Division, finishing each year in the top six. In the 2001–02 season, the club reached the semi-final of the Russian Cup but lost to CSKA Moscow 0–1. In 2003, with two matches left to play, Amkar was in fourth position, one point behind Kuban Krasnodar and losing out to Tom Tomsk and Terek Grozny on the total number of wins. According to the pundits, Amkar and Terek would be losers in this four-horse race but a sensational draw between Tom and Baltika Kaliningrad made the red and blacks favourites. In the final match, Kuban and Terek played each other. To move up into the Premier League, Amkar needed a win against Fakel Voronezh, which was duly achieved.

===2004–2008===
In the Premier League, Amkar at first performed satisfactorily, finishing 11th, 12th and 13th in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. Before the first season in the Premier League, Amkar was strengthened by such players as Ivan Levenets, Oleksandr Shutov, Vladimir Leonchenko, Zahari Sirakov, Andrei Lavrik, Ghenadie Olexici, Noureddine Ziyati and Erik Lincar, among others, and their debut match was away against Kuban Krasnodar. The match finished 0–0. In the first rounds, the team played well, gathering eight points in four matches with just a single defeat. In the 2004–05 season, Amkar repeated its success in the Russian Cup, once more reaching the semi-finals, but losing on aggregate 0–2 to Khimki. There were many memorable matches in the 2005 season, including a 1–0 home win over Zenit Saint Petersburg, a large 4–1 win over Dynamo Moscow and a 3–4 defeat to Lokomotiv Moscow, despite Amkar leading 3–0 at half-time. In the middle of the 2006 season, head coach Sergei Oborin resigned and was replaced by Rashid Rakhimov. Amkar began to play very good football, and in the part of the championship between the 19th and 30th rounds, Amkar was in fourth-place in the league. In the same season, Amkar had the longest series of matches in the Premier League without conceding a goal, with 15.

===2008. The most successful season===
In 2007, the club made two key acquisitions: Georgi Peev arrived from Dynamo Kyiv and Nikola Drinčić from Turkish club Gaziantepspor. These players became leaders of the team and during the season the team was no longer forced to struggle for survival and could play more confidently, but several factors prevented it from rising higher than eighth place. However, in the 2007–08 Russian Cup, Amkar achieved its best result in its history. On 16 April 2008, the club beat Ural Yekaterinburg 1–0 and reached the final, losing to CSKA Moscow in a penalty shootout.

Before the start of the 2008 season, head coach Rashid Rakhimov left the club for Lokomotiv Moscow and was replaced by a little-known specialist from Montenegro, Miodrag Božović. Before the break for UEFA Euro 2008, Amkar was in third place in the standings, one point behind second-placed Spartak Moscow and six adrift of leaders Rubin Kazan. After the break, one of Amkar&#x27;s team leaders, Vladimir Gabulov, and the captain, Aleksei Popov, left the team to join Dynamo Moscow and Rubin Kazan respectively. Two matches in a row on the &quot;equator&quot; of the Championship Amkar could have topped the league table but was unable to beat Tom Tomsk and Spartak Nalchik at home. On 16 November, after beating Tom in Tomsk, with one match left to play, the team from the Urals secured fourth place in the league to earn a spot in the qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League. Once more, Amkar had the best record in the Premier League for not conceding goals, with 17 matches. The 2008 season had been the best in the history of Amkar.
===2009–2011===
The following season, Dimitar Dimitrov, having replaced Miodrag Božović, was unable to continue the success of his predecessor. For the first five rounds of the 2009 Championship, the team conceded just one goal, but thereafter began to commit gross mistakes in defence on a regular basis, as a result of which the club was left fighting for survival. On 27 August, Amkar played hosts to English Premier League club Fulham in the second leg of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League play-off match, having lost the first leg in London 1–3, which left little hope of reaching the group stage of the tournament. The match in Perm was played before a full stadium and Amkar won 1–0, but that was not enough to go through to the next round. After the 20th round of the Championship, Rashid Rakhimov returned as head coach with the specific task of retaining the club&#x27;s place in the Premier League, a task which he successfully fulfilled. Notably, in the 2009 Russian Championship, Amkar&#x27;s goalkeepers saved four penalties out of five.
In the Russian Cup, Amkar defeated the two Avangard clubs from Kursk and Podolsk, then in the quarter-final was awarded a technical victory over the defunct FC Moscow. However, on 21 April 2010, Amkar lost at home in the semi-final to Zenit in a penalty shoot-out, having played full-time and extra time 0–0. In the 2010 season, fighting for survival until the very end, for the first time not having won a single match away from home and scoring the fewest goals, Amkar finished in 14th place and retained their place in the Premier League. After the final whistle had sounded in the last match of the season, Martin Kushev, captain and one of the best players in the history of the club, the team&#x27;s top scorer in the Premier League, having played for Amkar from 2005 until 2010, announced the end of his career as a player. After the completion of his playing career at Amkar, Martin should have become assistant coach to Rakhimov, but the management offered him a place in the coaching staff of the youth team. Kushev preferred to return to Bulgaria to join Slavia Sofia. Six months later, he became head coach of Slavia.

On 21 December 2010, a statement to the effect that Amkar was voluntarily to join the First Division due to financial difficulties appeared on the club&#x27;s official website. As a result, supporters of the club attempted to raise funds in support of Amkar, appealing to representatives of Perm business circles. However, the powers that be did not rate the actions of the supporters highly. Gennady Shilov stated that he was prepared to replace retiring Valery Chuprakov as club President. Shilov also stated an intent to approach the regional authorities for help and to look for sponsors. The Premier League gave Amkar until 15 January. On 25 January 2011 Amkar withdrew its request to leave the Premier League.
In 2011, the club began to give more opportunities to young players such as Mikhalyov, Kolomeytsev, Burmistrov and Sekretov. The team had an inconsistent season, memorable for the club and the fans were dramatic matches with Kuban Krasnodar, which ended in a 3–2 defeat, a 1–1 draw with Zenit at the Petrovsky Stadium and a 2–1 victory over Spartak Moscow at the Luzhniki Stadium. On 28 September 2011, after a series of ten matches without a win in official matches, the club parted with Rashid Rakhimov by mutual consent. The next day, 29 September 2011, the team introduced its new head coach, Miodrag Božović, who had been head of Amkar in 2008 and led the club to fourth place in the Russian Championship and the final of the National Cup. After the first half of the 2011–12 Russian Championship season, the team was in 12th place.

===After 2011===
On 11 June 2012, Miodrag Božović resigned once more as head coach and the Youth Team Head Coach, Rustem Khuzin, was appointed acting head coach. Under their new coach Amkar, for the first time in their history, the club beat CSKA Moscow (3–1) in the second half of the Championship. In the 12th round match against Terek Grozny, Amkar appeared in new kit with the Uralkali logo. However, the team played poorly for the rest of the season, managing only four points from their last eight games (an away win over Lokomotiv Moscow and a draw away to Mordovia Saransk).
On 17 January 2013, since Rustem Huzin had been accepted on a coaching course for his UEFA Pro Licence, he became eligible for the post of head coach, and Trubachev&#x27;s contract was terminated. From then on, Huzin officially served as Amkar&#x27;s head coach. Under Huzin, Amkar recorded its biggest ever victory in the Premier League over Alania Vladikavkaz (5–1), and then played out draws with Dynamo Moscow (1–1), and Rubin Kazan (1–1), having lost their Spring matches to Kuban Krasnodar (1–2) and Spartak Moscow (0–2). A series without a win followed the victory over Alania and after the Dynamo match Amkar lost to Terek Grozny (1–2) and Lokomotiv Moscow (2–4).
After another devastating defeat from Kuban (0–4), followed by a victory over their direct rivals Rostov (3–2), and a goalless draw with Zenit, the club retained the right to play in the Premier League.

In June 2013, the club opted not to renew the contracts of Rustem Huzin and senior team coach Alexander Gorshkov, which were due to expire in the summer. Amkar&#x27;s new head coach became Stanislav Cherchesov, who had previously been working with Terek Grozny. He was appointed on a two-year contract and was accompanied by the new senior team coach Miroslav Romaschenko, goalkeeper coach Gintaras Staučė team doctor Eduard Tsgoev, all of whom had been at Terek.

On 13 June 2018, the club announced that the Russian Football Union had recalled their 2018–19 season license, making them ineligible for the Russian Premier League or Russian Football National League. On 18 June 2018, club president Gennadi Shilov announced that the club would not register for the third-tier Russian Professional Football League and would be dissolved. FC Zvezda Perm was reestablished during the offseason and entered the PFL for the 2018–19 season.

===After 2020===
In August 2020 Amkar was reestablished to participate in the Amateur league under the sponsorship of the local government. After the end of 2020 season of Russian Amateur Football League, the head of Perm Krai says Amkar will apply for Professional Licence to play in Russian Professional Football League. The club was successfully licensed for the 2021–22 season.

==Current squad==
&quot;As of 13 February 2025, according to the Second League website.&quot;

==Russian Championship and Cup results==

==In Europe==
Amkar participated in European football only once. Having finished fourth in the 2008 Russian Championship, the club earned the right to play in the Europa League. Amkar lost the first match to the English club Fulham 1–3, and although they won the second match 1–0, the team was eliminated on aggregate and Fulham progressed, eventually reaching the final.

<text>Mädler is a lunar impact crater located on the mare that joins Sinus Asperitatis in the north to Mare Nectaris to the southeast. To the west is the prominent crater Theophilus, and Mädler lies amidst the outer .

The rim of Mädler is irregular and somewhat oblong in shape. There is a low central peak that joins a ridge crossing the floor. To the east of the crater are ray markings that include a ring-shape to the northeast.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mädler.

<doc id="940437" wikidata="Q618770" url="?curid=940437" title="Apocalypse Dudes">
<text>Apocalypse Dudes is the fourth album by the Norwegian band Turbonegro. It was released on February 23, 1998, and is the first studio album to feature lead guitarist Euroboy and drummer Chris Summers, and the last release before the band disbanded in December 1998.

The album saw the band move towards a more glam rock-oriented sound mixed with punk and proved to be a breakthrough record for the underground band. It is the first part of the &quot;Apocalypse Trilogy&quot;, consisting of &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; (1998), &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; (2003) and &quot;Party Animals&quot; (2005). The snake on the cover art is taken from the American militant far-left organization Symbionese Liberation Army&#x27;s banner/flag.

== Production ==
Following the addition of Euroboy and the drummer Chris Summers, Turbonegro had adapted a new sound with the release of their &quot;Prince of the Rodeo&quot; single, gradually moving from punk rock to glam rock. After extensive touring in support of their previous album, &quot;Ass Cobra&quot;, the band entered Endless Sound studio in late 1997. The band originally planned to release an EP consisting of the songs &quot;Get It On&quot;, &quot;Zillion Dollar Sadist&quot; and a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Suffragette City&quot;, but as they wrote more songs, they decided to record an album instead. Hank von Helvete struggled with heroin addiction during the recording process and almost quit the band. The vocals for &quot;Are You Ready (For Some Darkness)&quot; took several days to record due to his poor health. Turbonegro finished the recording in late 1997 and signed a contract with Virgin Records to release the album.

While its predecessor, &quot;Ass Cobra&quot;, was an all-out punk rock record with fast, short songs and a harsh sound, &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; featured a more produced, rock-oriented sound characterized by a wall of guitars, lengthier compositions and guitar solos. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;The Age of Pamparius&quot;, begins with a slow, ascending guitar solo over piano and acoustic guitar, reminiscent of Alice Cooper, before fading into a myriad of synth noises and a whispering voice introducing the album, followed by a plucked guitar riff that erupts into fast-paced glam rock and sing-along vocals. &quot;Get It On&quot; is introduced by hard-hitting drums and a guitar riff in the style of The Dictators. &quot;Rock Against Ass&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Motherfucker, Motherfucker&quot; contains elements of pop rock. &quot;Prince of the Rodeo&quot; features a signature Euroboy riff and conga drums bridge, while &quot;Humiliation Street&quot; is reminiscent of the Stooges and ends with an extended instrumental section that includes several guitar solos. The album&#x27;s final song, &quot;Good Head&quot;, is a cover version of a song by Euroboy and Happy-Tom&#x27;s former garage rock band, The Vikings.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; was released on February 23, 1998, through Virgin Records in Norway, and Boomba Records and Bitzcore Records in Germany. It was released in the United States on Man&#x27;s Ruin/Sympathy for the Record Industry on 26 January 1999. Following Turbonegro&#x27;s reunion in 2002, the album was re-released on 27 January 2003 through Burning Heart Records in Sweden and Epitaph Records in the US. &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; is certified gold in Norway.

Upon release, &quot;Moshable&quot; magazine commented, &quot;&quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; is the perfect mix of classic 70&#x27;s US punk / rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll like The Dictators, The Heartbreakers &amp; The Ramones... every tune on this release is fucking brilliant.&quot; Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys was quoted as saying, &quot;The new Turbonegro record is possibly the most important European record ever.&quot;

The original Boomba Records announcement from April 1998 states, &quot;This my friends, is a virtually perfect record! Excellent production - a huge, FAT sound; lots of power and excellent songs that you can&#x27;t get out of your head. Not one let down through 47 minutes of music!! This is not an underground tip!! &#x27;Apocalypse Dudes&#x27; appeals to the masses. From punk to metal to mainstream, &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; has something for everyone.&quot;

Pitchfork rated &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; 8.6 out of 10. while Punk News rated it four and a half stars out of five.

<doc id="940439" wikidata="Q5075739" url="?curid=940439" title="Charles Braithwaite">
<text>Charles Braithwaite (c. 1850 – June 9, 1910) was a Manitoba politician and agrarian leader. From 1891 to 1897, he was the leader of the province&#x27;s Patrons of Industry.

Braithwaite was born in Folston, England. A farmer&#x27;s son with little formal education, he left England for Canada in the 1870s, initially living in Durham, Ontario but moving to Manitoba in 1881. After shifting between cities and jobs for a few years, he settled as a farmer in Portage la Prairie in 1883.

In 1891, Braithwaite joined the Farmers&#x27; Institute, an educational and lobbying group representing the concerns of farmers. He also joined a Patrons of Industry local in the spring of the same year. A powerful orator, Braithwaite was elected Grand President of the Manitoba Patrons at their first provincial convention in November, and held this position until January 1897.

The Patrons of Industry were originally an agrarian fraternal organization and discussion forum operating throughout the United States and Canada. In Ontario and Manitoba, they followed in the tradition of earlier agrarian groups by opposing the national policy of John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Conservative government. Under the national policy, Manitoba farmers were required to pay high prices for equipment while receiving relatively low prices for their goods. Braithwaite was able to lead a populist movement in opposition to this policy, using the slogan &quot;Manitoba for Manitobans&quot; to promote his organization&#x27;s goals.

During Braithwaite&#x27;s first three years as Patron leader, the organization focused on agrarian cooperation via the Patrons Commercial Union. This union failed due to poor management, after its members refused to contribute enough materials to attract commercial interests.

The Manitoba Patrons turned to direct political action in 1894. Originally a Liberal, Braithwaite encouraged the party to run its own candidates in provincial and federal elections to protest existing political corruption. Braithwaite himself conducted a successful tour of the province to spread this message. By the end of the year, membership in the Manitoba Patrons had grown to about 5000, and the party had nominated candidates in all but two constituencies in anticipation of the next provincial election. In the summer of 1894, Patron candidate John Forsyth defeated Conservative leader John Andrew Davidson in a by-election for the Manitoba legislature. (Forsyth subsequently violated party policy by using a railway pass as a privilege of elected office, and was expelled from the Patrons in October 1895).

The Patrons were, however, a divided organization. Braithwaite frequently quarrelled with Henry Clay, the hardline editor of the Patrons newspaper whose intemperate comments often drove financial supporters away from the party. Clay was replaced as editor in early 1895, but other divisions subsequently surfaced. (Clay recalled the event differently - according to him, he was with the paper until the end when he signed the printing press over to the print-shop employees to pay their wages owing.)

In early 1895, Braithwaite travelled to Toronto to help create the platform of a national Patrons party, which advocated agrarian reform, prohibition and woman&#x27;s suffrage. Soon after this, however, the Manitoba Patrons became divided by a local issue, the Manitoba Schools Question. Catholic Patrons became alienated from the party when it supported the government of Thomas Greenway in opposing denominational schools. The controversy also caused many Protestant farmers to rally around Greenway&#x27;s Liberals, further marginalizing the Patrons. Only seven Patrons candidates contested the 1896 provincial election in Manitoba, and of these only two were elected. Braithwaite had already declared himself a candidate for federal office, and did not run provincially.

In the 1896 federal election, Braithwaite contested the riding of Macdonald on a platform of non-sectarian schools, electoral reform, agricultural interests, free trade, public utilities ownership, prohibition and universal suffrage. His campaign was marginalized by a close national race between the Conservatives and Liberals, and was dealt a further blow when Charles Tupper&#x27;s Conservatives unveiled a platform that promoted many of the Patrons goals. Braithwaite finished third in his riding, and stepped down as Grand President in January 1897. The Patrons effectively ceased to exist as a viable political group in Manitoba after this time, although many of their policies would later resurface in the Progressive Party of Canada.

Braithwaite lost his farm to fire and did not have the funds to re-build as he had been operating a farm beyond his ability anyway. Braithwaite, who had led the party since 1891, stepped down as party leader in January 1897, and the party effectively ceased to exist after this time.

He accepted office as Manitoba&#x27;s provincial weed inspector, serving from 1897 to 1901. He returned to his farm after this, and in 1904 moved to Chilliwack, British Columbia. He later became the first postmaster of the small community of Camp Slough, and died in 1910.

<text>In biology, a lerp is a structure of crystallized honeydew produced by larvae of psyllid bugs as a protective cover. These animals are commonly referred to as lerp insects, of which there are over 300 species in Australia.

Lerps are energy rich, consisting mostly of starch, with some proteins and fats. They are eaten by flying foxes, possums and birds such as pardalotes and honeyeaters.

The word is derived from the Wemba Wemba word &quot;lerep&quot;. Lerps are traditionally eaten by Indigenous people, and can be stored as dry balls for future use.

<text>Manners is a lunar impact crater located in the western part of the Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 15 km. It was named after British astronomer Russell Henry Manners. To the northeast is the larger crater Arago and to the south are Ritter and Sabine. The crater has a rim with a higher albedo than the surrounding mare, making it appear bright. This is a circular, bowl-shaped feature with a raised rim and a relatively flat interior.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified and realised on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Manners.

<text>Jan Patočka (; 1 June 1907 – 13 March 1977) was a Czech philosopher. Having studied in Prague, Paris, Berlin, and Freiburg, he was one of the last pupils of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. In Freiburg he also developed a lifelong philosophical friendship with Husserl&#x27;s assistant Eugen Fink. Patočka worked in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic for almost his entire career, but never joined the Communist Party and was affected by persecution, which ended in his death as a dissident spokesperson of Charter 77.

Patočka was a prolific writer and lecturer with a wide range of reference, contributing much to existential phenomenology as well as the interpretation of Czech culture and European culture in general. From his Czech collected works, some of the most notable have been translated to English and other major languages. These include the late works &quot;Plato and Europe&quot; (1973) and &quot;Heretical Essays in the Philosophy of History&quot; (1975), in which Patočka developed a philosophy of history identifying the Socratic-Platonic theme of the care of the soul as the basis of &quot;Europe&quot;.

==Early life==
Patočka attended Jan Neruda Grammar School.

In 1936 he completed his habilitation with a thesis entitled &quot; Přirozený svět jako filosofický problém &quot; (The natural world as a philosophical problem), the first systematic phenomenological study in the Czech language, which was correspondingly influential on Czech philosophy. In 1937, Patočka took over the post of editor-in-chief of the philosophical journal &quot; Česká mysl &quot; (The Czech Mind). In 1938 he became a member of the Institut International de Philosophie.

==Works==
His works mainly dealt with the problem of the original, given world (&quot;Lebenswelt&quot;), its structure and the human position in it. He tried to develop this Husserlian concept under the influence of some core Heideggerian themes (e.g. historicity, technicity, etc.) On the other hand, he also criticised Heideggerian philosophy for not dealing sufficiently with the basic structures of being-in-the-world, which are not truth-revealing activities (this led him to an appreciation of the work of Hannah Arendt). From this standpoint he formulated his own original theory of &quot;three movements of human existence&quot;: 1) &quot;receiving&quot;, 2) &quot;reproduction&quot;, 3) &quot;transcendence&quot;. He also translated many of Hegel&#x27;s and Schelling&#x27;s works into Czech. In his lifetime, Patočka published in Czech, German, and French.

Apart from his writing on the problem of the &quot;Lebenswelt&quot;, he wrote interpretations of Presocratic and classical Greek philosophy and several longer essays on the history of Greek ideas in the formation of our concept of Europe. Patočka increasingly focused on the idea of Europe during the 1970s. As he was banned from teaching (see below), he held clandestine lectures in his private apartment on the Greek thought in general and on Plato in particular in the late 70s. These clandestine lectures are collectively known as &quot;Plato and Europe&quot;, and they are published under the same title in English. He also entered into discussions about modern Czech philosophy, art, history and politics. He was an esteemed scholar of Czech thinkers such as Komensky (b.1592) (also known as Comenius) and Masaryk (b.1850). In 1971, he has published a small treatise on Comenius in German titled &quot;Die Philosophy der Erziehung des J.A. Comenius (Comenius&#x27;s Philosophy of Education).&quot; In 1977, his work on Masaryk culminated in &#x27;Two Studies on Masaryk, which was initially a privately circulated typescript.

Patočka&#x27;s &quot;Heretical Essays in the Philosophy of History&quot; is analyzed at length and with much care in Jacques Derrida&#x27;s important book &quot;The Gift of Death.&quot; Derrida was the most recent person who wrote or conversed with Patočka&#x27;s thought; Paul Ricoeur and Roman Jakobson (who respectively wrote the preface and afterword to the French edition of the &quot;Heretical Essays&quot;) are two further examples.
During the years 1939–1945, when the Czech universities were closed, as well as between 1951 and 1968, and from 1972 on, Patočka was banned from teaching. Only a few of his books were published and most of his work circulated only in the form of typescripts kept by students and disseminated mostly after his death. Along with other banned intellectuals he gave lectures at the so-called &quot;Underground University&quot;, which was an informal institution that tried to offer a free, uncensored cultural education. In January 1977 he became one of the original signatories and main spokespersons for the Charter 77 (Charta 77) human rights movement in Czechoslovakia. For the three months after the Charter was released he was intensely active writing and speaking about the meaning of the Charter, in spite of his deteriorating health. He was also interrogated by the police regarding his involvement with the Charter movement. On March 3, 1977, he was held by the police for ten hours, who had claimed that he would be allowed to speak in his role as a Charter spokesperson with a high-ranking official (in fact, this was a pretext to keep him from attending a reception at the West German embassy). He fell ill that evening and was taken to the hospital, where his health briefly improved, enabling him to give one final interview with &quot;Die Zeit &quot;and to write one final essay entitled &quot;What We Can Expect from Charter 77.&quot; On March 11 he relapsed, and on March 13 he died of apoplexy, at the age of 69.

His brother František Patočka was a microbiologist.

<text>McDonald is a small lunar impact crater located in the central Mare Imbrium. It was named after American benefactor William Johnson McDonald and Scottish selenographer Thomas Logie MacDonald. This crater is a cup-shaped feature with a circular rim, and has not been significantly eroded. It lies to the southeast of the slightly larger crater Carlini, in an isolated part of the mare.

This feature was identified as &#x27;Carlini B&#x27; prior to being renamed by the IAU.

<doc id="940468" wikidata="Q16167185" url="?curid=940468" title="Pat Sharp">
<text>Patrick Sharpin known professionally as Pat Sharp, is an English radio presenter, television presenter and DJ. He worked on the children&#x27;s ITV programme &quot;Fun House&quot;, was one of the Sky Channel&#x27;s VJs and presented the Coca-Cola Eurochart Top 50 and Nescafé UK Top 50.

==Radio work==
Sharp worked as a presenter at BBC Radio 1 in 1982 and 1983, mixing holiday cover for other radio presenters with a regular early Sunday morning slot and television appearances hosting BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He deputised for David Jensen on &quot;The Network Chart Show&quot;. In the mid-1980s he became a DJ for Radio Mercury and has also worked for the British Forces Broadcasting Service. For 10 years, starting in 1987, Sharp was a DJ on Capital FM in London followed by another 11 years at Heart, both in London and Cambridge.

In the late 1980s, Sharp teamed up with his Capital colleague Mick Brown as the duo Pat and Mick, to release the charity singles &quot;Let&#x27;s All Chant&quot; and &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Stopped Dancing Yet&quot;. Both songs made the Top 20 of the UK singles chart. The duo released five hit singles making the Top 75, raising more than a million pounds for charity.

In 1987, he was voted as having the worst haircut (winning this accolade more than once) at the &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Poll Winners Party awards, where he was also in the top three DJs. He was awarded the Sony Award in 1992 for best DJ.

Between 1997 and 2004, Sharp presented Heart 106.2&#x27;s weekday morning &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; show. Following this, Sharp was a presenter on the Century FM group of stations. In December 2010, Sharp joined Smooth Radio to host Weekend Breakfast. He was officially appointed as the station&#x27;s Weekend Breakfast presenter in January 2011. In January 2013 Sharp became the station&#x27;s weekday afternoon presenter after an overhaul of the Smooth schedule, replacing Carlos who moved to weeknights.

Smooth Radio was acquired by Global Radio in 2013. Following a studio and business move to Global&#x27;s headquarters in Leicester Square, Pat Sharp and David Jensen were then dropped from the schedules on 19 December 2013. Sharp started broadcasting on the Breeze network New Year&#x27;s Eve 2013. He also formerly appeared regularly on Sam FM south coast.

In 2018, Sharp covered the mid-morning show on Southampton-based Hampshire Hit Radio for a week. He also appeared covering on Guildford-based Eagle Radio in recent years, before that station became Greatest Hits Radio.

Sharp fronts &quot;All The Hits&quot;, a weekly syndicated radio show produced by Blue Revolution, which is broadcast on various stations around the world.

From February 2019 to March 2023, Sharp presented a weekend radio show on Greatest Hits Radio, as well as P8 Pop in Norway.

==Television work==
During his brief Radio 1 career in 1982/83, Sharp presented a few editions of the music programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and returned as one of the many presenters on the last programme. In 1987-88, he presented ITV show &quot;The Roxy&quot;, and in 1990-91 he presented daily chart show &quot;The Power Chart&quot; on BSB satellite music television channel The Power Station. Sharp&#x27;s appearances on children&#x27;s television&#x27;s CITV include &quot;Fun House&quot;, a programme running from 1989 to 1999, produced by Scottish Television, which he presented along with Melanie and Martina Grant. During a 1994 episode of Fun House, Sharp was accidentally taken out by an overenthusiastic child in a go-kart. Though he laughed it off at the time, he later revealed the impact had torn his meniscus, leaving him with chronic knee pain, and in later interviews he admitted to undergoing therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing recurring nightmares of garishly coloured go-karts hurtling towards him at full speed. 

Sharp was also one of the presenters of Saturday morning show &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot; (STV, 1992–94) and presented phone-in quiz show &quot;Hang On!&quot; (LWT for ITV) in 1996.

Sharp&#x27;s guest television appearances include several episodes of &quot;You Bet!&quot;, &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; and &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. In more recent years, Sharp has regularly appeared on music TV channels presenting continuity in programmes looking back at 80s and 90s music hits, appearing on channels including The Hits, Now 80s and Now 90s. He also appeared in episodes three and seven of the 24th series and episode four of the 26th series of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

In 2004, he participated in Channel 4 sports reality show &quot;The Games&quot; finishing last out of five contestants, but was proclaimed the People&#x27;s Hero. Further reality TV involvement came on 3 June 2006 when he appeared for a sketch on ITV2&#x27;s &quot;X Factor&quot; spin-off show &quot;X-Tra Factor: Battle Of The Stars&quot;. He appeared briefly on 23 June 2007 on a &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot; phone-in. However he did appear on the show in person as a guest on 12 July 2007, then appeared four years later on &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Bit on the Side&quot; on 27 October 2011.

In May 2010, Sharp appeared on &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; with Jenny Powell, Michael Barrymore and Anthea Redfern. He also appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; twice in the same series in 2010, along with BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;.

In November 2011, Sharp was a contestant on the eleventh series of the ITV reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

In 2017 Sharp played a version of himself in online mockumentary Getting Back with Dave Benson Phillips

In 2019, he appeared as a celebrity guest on &quot;Joe Lycett&#x27;s Got Your Back&quot;.

In 2021, Pat Sharp appeared on the BBC One game show &quot;Michael McIntyre&#x27;s The Wheel&quot;.

Pat Sharp appeared on the 2022 Christmas special of I Literally Just Told You.

<doc id="940473" wikidata="Q1060240" url="?curid=940473" title="ISS Propulsion Module">
<text>The ISS Propulsion module was proposed as a backup to functions performed by the Zvezda Service Module and Progress spacecraft. Critical ISS functionality such as guidance, navigation, control and propulsion are provided only by Russian (Zvezda and Progress) and the European (ATV) spacecraft. A Propulsion Module would have been needed for ISS altitude maintenance and reboost, debris avoidance maneuvers, attitude control and propellant supply in the event the Zvezda Service Module was not available (launch failure, etc.) to the International Space Station. If the Zvezda had not been available, the Interim Control Module would have been used at first. It only had a lifetime of three years; then the Propulsion Module would have been necessary.

==History==
The ISS requires an average 7,000 kg of propellant each year for altitude maintenance, debris avoidance and attitude control. A Propulsion Module would have provided reserve propellant for one year of ISS orbit life in case of supply interruption. A Propulsion Module would have been attached to the Unity node of the ISS.

Multiple supply vehicles are required to satisfy the ISS&#x27;s 7,000 kg annual average propellant need. The then-current plan for six Progress M1 spacecraft per year met that need.

The Propulsion Module would hold 9808 kg fuel. Progress M holds 1100 kg; Progress M1 holds 1950 kg. ESA ATV holds 4,000 kg. The cancelled U.S. Interim Control Module holds 5000 kg of fuel. A Shuttle Orbiter ISS generic reboost had 232 kg of fuel available. An Orbiter Max reboost mission had 1626 kg of reboost fuel available. Zarya FGB [Russian: ФГБ - Функциональный Грузовой Блок, English: Functional (or Operational) Cargo Block (or Module)] holds 5,500 kg and the Zvezda Service module holds 860 kg, however, it is generally preferred to keep the main thrusters on Zarya and Zvezda in reserve, as they have finite lifespans.

The Propulsion Module, besides being part of the backup plan for if the Service Module was not available, was intended to be an American-owned propulsion system for the station and planned as a late addition. However, the original design was over budget and late. An alternative design, the &quot;Node X&quot; design, which was built around an improperly fabricated hull intended for Node 2 or 3, was then proposed and tentatively included in the plan, designed with two detachable fuel modules that could be carried up and down in a Shuttle cargo bay for replacement to avoid the problems of transferring propellant between tanks in space. It has subsequently been deleted from the plans, instead requiring the station to rely on the ATV and Progress spacecraft for reboost. Furthermore, in the wake of the Shuttle&#x27;s retirement, further redesign of the Propulsion Module would have been necessary.

<text>Lough Ennell () is a lake near the town of Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland. It is situated beside the N52 road, off the Mullingar/Kilbeggan road. The lake is part of the Lough Ennell Special Protection Area. It is long by wide, with an area of about . Lough Ennell has a large area of shallow water with nearly two-thirds of its area being less than 25 feet (8 m) and almost half of it being under deep. The lake produced Ireland&#x27;s largest ever lake brown trout at 26 lbs (11.8 kg). 

The main river flowing into Lough Ennell is the River Brosna, which enters on the Mullingar side of the lake and exits on the opposite side at Lilliput. Lilliput and Lilliput House were frequently used by Jonathan Swift as a holiday home and place to write, local tradition states that Jonathan Swift was in a boat on the lake when he looked back at Lilliput and noticed how small the people looked at that distance, hence the inspiration for his most famous book &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Lilliput at the time was called &quot;Nure&quot; however after the publication of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; locals began to refer to the lakeshore as Lilliput, the name stuck and today the area is known as Lilliput.

==Facilities==
The loughside has a caravan and camping park, boat hire facilities, hotels and restaurants and a fishery. Belvedere House is also an attraction and is managed by the County Council, it hosts a number of sporting and cultural events annually such as concerts and triathlons.

==Angling==
Lough Ennell fishery is part of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board&#x27;s Midland Fisheries Group of managed waters. Brown trout and pike are the main catches.
In recent times it appears that stocks of both game and coarse fish in the lake have been declining. There is speculation locally as to the reason for this. In 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the water quality at Lilliput beach on the Lough as &quot;poor&quot;.

==Sport==
*Westmeath County Council has banned the use of jet skis on the lake. The prohibition came into effect in October 2006 and currently does not apply to speed boats.
*The shores of Lough Ennell host Mullingar Golf Club, the local golf club to the north east of the lake.
*The lake hosts Triathlons at Lilliput and Belvedere.

<doc id="940482" wikidata="Q1637589" url="?curid=940482" title="Chennai Mass Rapid Transit System">
<text>The Chennai Mass Rapid Transit System, commonly referred to as Chennai MRTS, is a metropolitan rail transit system in Chennai, India. It is operated by Southern Railway of the state-owned Indian Railways. Opened in 1995, it was the first elevated railway line in India. The railway line runs from Chennai Beach to Velachery, covering a distance of with 18 stations and is integrated with the wider Chennai suburban railway network.

While the suburban railway has been operational in Chennai since 1931, the Planning Commission of Government of India formed a research group to recommend development of transportation in major cities including Madras in 1965. The Madras Area Transportation Study Unit identified eight transport corridors including the north–southeastern rail corridor along the Buckingham Canal. The Government of India approved a Mass Rapid Transit System for the southern section in 1983–84 with the project to be implemented in four phases. The project was implemented by the Ministry of Railways and construction began in 1991. The first phase from Chennai Beach to Chepauk was completed in 1995 with further extension to Thirumayilai in 1997. Part of second phase from Thirumayilai to Thiruvanmiyur was completed in 2004 with further extension to Velachery in 2007. , a planned extension to St. Thomas Mount is under construction.

The Chennai MRTS line is largely elevated with at-grade sections at its terminals. The line runs at-grade initially till Park Town, parallel to the suburban railway network. It becomes elevated thereon, roughly following the course of the Buckingham Canal and running parallel to the Coromandel Coast till Thiruvanmiyur before deviating west towards Velachery. It uses the same broad gauge (5 ft 6in) as the suburban system, thus allowing the movements of trains between the existing suburban lines and the MRTS. The Chennai MRTS uses 9-car electrical multiple unit (EMU) train sets. The trains use 25 kV overhead catenary for traction. The coaches are manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai. The coaches are not air-conditioned and are equipped with first-class and second-class passenger seating.

, the system has a daily ridership of 100,000. With the implementation of the Chennai Metro Rail starting in 2015 and planned expansion of the same, further expansion of the MRTS system was put on hold in 2017, with the plans for the MRTS system to be taken over by Chennai Metro Rail Limited. In 2022, the Southern Railway of Indian Railways gave an in-principle approval for the take-over under which the coaches, stations and other infrastructure will be upgraded on par with the Chennai Metro.

== Background ==
The Chennai Suburban Railway started operations in 1931 on a single electrified line from Chennai Beach to Tambaram. Suburban services commenced on the second line between Chennai Central and Gummidipoondi in 1985 the third line from Central towards Arakkonam was added later. In 1965, the Planning Commission formed a group to study the suitability of the existing transportation network, to ascertain the viability of various ways of transportation and advocate plans for the expansion of transportation in metropolitan cities including Madras.

=== Planning ===
Surveys were conducted to supplement the existing transport infrastructure in Madras, such as the Madras Area Transportation Study (1968), Integrated Transport Plan (1977) and Madras Route Rationalisation Study (1986). The Madras Area Transportation Study Unit (MATSU) identified eight important transport corridors including the north–southeastern rail corridor connecting Kasturba Nagar and Manali Road. The study suggested the implementation of a rail-based Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) on the southern section of the line along the Buckingham Canal, connecting to the existent suburban system. The system was envisaged as a loop line connecting Chennai Beach and Tiruvottiyur.

Since the planned railway line would pass through congested parts of the city, an elevated rail system was selected, to avoid land acquisition problems. The project was intended to be implemented in four phases: Chennai Beach to Thirumayilai, Tirumayilai to St. Thomas Mount, St. Thomas Mount to Villivakkam and Villivakkam to Ennore.

== Construction and opening ==
=== Phase I ===
The project was sanctioned for implementation by the Ministry of Railways, Government of India in 1983-84. After multiple delays, construction began in 1991 and part of the first phase from Chennai Beach to Chepauk was completed in 1995. It became operational on 16 November 1995 and was the first operational elevated railway line in India. The line was extended to Thirumayilai in 1997. The cost of construction of the first phase between Chennai Beach and Thirumayilai, estimated to be , was fully financed by the Government of India. The first phase was projected to serve about 600,000 passengers per day.

=== Phase II ===
RITES conducted further studies in 1987 and 1994 on the effectiveness of the existing public transport system for the growing population. The studies proposed further expansion of the MRTS line. In 1998, the Railway Board sanctioned Phase II of the project from Thirumayilai to Velachery. Part of the Phase II line from Thirumaylai to Thiruvanmiyur was opened on 26 January 2004. It initially consisted of a single line of track for both forward and return journeys. On 19 November 2007, the network was extended from Thiruvanmiyur to Velachery. While the state government gave only the required land for the first phase, it contributed two-thirds of the total project cost of for the second phase.

=== Phase II extension ===
The construction for the extended second phase of the project connecting Velachery with St. Thomas Mount started in 2008. It was planned at an estimated cost of with the central government bearing two-thirds of the cost and the state government bearing the rest. The initial planned alignment was altered subsequently and necessitated the demolition of over 70 residential units, which led to protests by the locals. In the Government of India&#x27;s annual Railway Budget of 2012, it was announced that the line would be commissioned in 2013. In October 2012, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) resumed the land acquisition for the proposed extension after the Madras High Court vacated its earlier stay order on the same. While land acquisition was completed for the construction of majority of the line by April 2013, there were further delays in acquiring land for about of the stretch and the construction of Puzhuthivakkam station. , the construction of about of the proposed extension was complete. 

In May 2014, the High Court ruled that compensation be paid as per newly enacted Land Acquisition Act 2013 on the cases filed by the land owners. In March 2016, the Southern Railway stated that the final phase of the MRTS would take at least 18 months after the state government handed over land to Indian Railways and that it had not yet done so. In 2018, further discussion between the CMDA and the land owners on the compensation to be paid for the land acquisition failed. , the Indian Railways had completed the construction of Adambakkam Puzhuthivakkam stations and about of the line was pending for construction. In 2019, the Madras High Court directed the CMDA to pay higher compensation to the land owners. However, the CMDA filed a review petition against the order in the Indian Supreme Court. 

The Supreme Court ordered fair compensation for the land owners and directed the CMDA to complete the land acquisition by 8 January 2021. In June 2022, officials announced that the land acquisition for the final stretch would be completed in the next three months. In July 2023, the authorities said that the construction will be completed by the end of the month and the line will be commissioned for use within the end of the year. On 18 January 2024, a concrete girder on the stretch collapsed, which was expected to further delay the opening of the line. Multiple deadlines to make complete the construction of the final phase have not been met.

=== Future plans ===
The third and fourth phases of the MRTS were initially planned to connect St. Thomas Mount with Villivakkam and Villivakkam with Ennore. The plans have been shelved after the lines overlapped with the proposed extension of the Chennai Metro Rail. In early 2024, a feasibility report was submitted to the state government for a new line from Poonamallee and the planned new airport at Parandur. The line would have 19 stations and is expected to cost .

With the Chennai Metro operational since 2015, the Indian Railways proposed for the MRTS system to be taken over by Chennai Metro Rail Limited in 2017. In July 2018, PwC said that the merger would be expensive, costing around to replace the train-sets and establish other facilities. On 11 May 2022, the Southern Railway zone of the Indian Railways granted in-principle approval for the takeover. , the take over was still pending as the Indian Railway Board had not approved the same.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Network and lines ===
The MRTS line is largely elevated, with at-grade sections at its terminals. The line from Chennai Beach to Velachery has a elevated section and runs for about at surface. From Chennai Beach to Park Town, the line runs at-grade along the suburban railway line. From the Park Town station, the line becomes elevated and roughly follows the course of the Buckingham Canal, which runs parallel to the Coromandel Coast. The line remains elevated for the alignment of the second phase up to Perungudi, after which it returns to an at-grade section at the Velachery station. The extension of the line from Velachery to St. Thomas Mount is planned to be elevated.

The route taken by the MRTS line has resulted in the pillars of the elevated section of the railway encroaching the Buckingham Canal. Although the pillars were placed basis the approval of the state government, the government later proposed plans to restore the canal to make it navigable. However, as the MRTS pillars have reduced the canal width, a section of the canal is not navigable, and the pillars block the flow of rainwater discharge.

=== Track ===
The Chennai MRTS line bears greater resemblance to the suburban railway than a rapid transit line as it uses the same broad gauge (5 ft 6in) as the Chennai Suburban Railway system, allowing the usage of same train-sets across the existing suburban lines and the MRTS. Ballastless track is used between Tirumayilai and Velachery stations. The trains use 25 kV overhead catenary for traction.

=== Rolling stock ===
The Chennai MRTS uses nine-car electrical multiple unit train sets. A nine-car rake typically has three sets of three motor coaches each at the front, the middle and the last with electric motors used to drive the wheels of the train at a stipulated speed. The EMU coaches are manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai. The coaches are not air-conditioned and are equipped with two-class (first and second class) passenger seating configuration.

=== Stations ===
, the MRTS line has 18 operational stations. The Chennai Beach station, one of the termini, is a hub for several suburban trains. Along with the Chennai Fort station, it offers connectivity to the commercial area of Broadway. The Park Town station is located near the Chennai Central station, which is a hub for other suburban lines and for long-distance express trains.

Places of interest such as Parthasarathy Temple, Kapaleeshwarar Temple and Mundagakanniamman Koil are located close to the MRTS railway line. Marina Beach spans along a stretch of the line close to Thiruvallikeni station. The Chepauk station is located close to the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium. The MRTS passes along the Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), which also forms part of the information technology corridor where many companies are located.

Upon completion of the St. Thomas Mount station at the southern end of the proposed alignment, the station will have three types of railway networks. The suburban and long-distance express trains would ply on the conventional tracks at ground level, the elevated MRTS line will be located at the first level and the Chennai Metro operating at the second level. There are large stations on the existing MRTS line designed to accommodate six and nine-car train rakes with attached parking lots.


Indian Railways has made various plans to use the empty space in the MRTS stations. In February 2009, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) announced plans to set up food stalls at MRTS stations with the first such stall inaugurated in April 2018 at Thiruvanmiyur station.

MRTS has been criticised by the public for poor maintenance of the stations, lack of inter-modal transport facilities and security issues. The director of Chennai Metro called for the various government agencies to work together to improve the connectivity to the stations. The stations often face issues such as seepage of rainwater and no access to clean drinking water. A 2006 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India cited delays in installation of station amenities such as escalators.

In 2012, there was a shortage of the Railway Protection Force personnel at MRTS stations, which raised security concerns. In 2013, to improve the security for the passengers using the network, Indian Railways declared that the MRTS stations would have a single designated entry and exit point as it was difficult for the existing RPF personnel to monitor multiple gates at the same time. If the planned takeover by Chennai Metro is completed, the existing line is planned to be upgraded to be compatible with the metro system. Plans to modernise infrastructure include improved facilities at stations and single integrated ticketing system among others.

== Operations ==
The operational route length between Chennai Beach and Velachery is with a journey time of more than 45 minutes one way. The system handles about 70 trains on weekdays and reduced capacity on Sundays. In 2012, Indian Railways made the schedule for the MRTS services available on Google Maps on Android smartphones. The trains can be tracked in real time and the users are provided with updates through an automated SMS system.

=== Fares and ticketing ===
The minimum fare for a second class is . A second class ticket from Beach to Velachery is priced at . First class tickets cost about five times higher than the second class fare. In addition to one-time tickets, the Southern Railway issues monthly tickets and quarterly season tickets for frequent travelers. Short validity tickets are available for tourists. The tickets can be bought at the railway ticket counters or booked through a mobile application.

=== Patronage ===
The ridership of the Chennai MRTS system increased from approximately 9,000 in 2003 to 66,518 passengers per day in 2008. When the line was extended up to Velachery in 2007, the daily ridership increased and it saw a three-fold increase in the revenue. , the daily ridership is about 100,000. Three stations—Beach, Thirumayilai, and Velachery—account for nearly 40 percent of the ridership.

In 2010, the Indian Railways rolled out dedicated trains for women, which saw poor patronage. In 2023, Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) introduced new plans to improve last-mile connectivity to the stations. Indian Railways operates special trains on certain occasions to boost revenue. As the route passes close to some popular religious sites, the MRTS operates special trains during popular religious festivals such as the Vaikunta Ekadashi at Parthasarathy Temple in Thiruvallikeni and the Arupathumoovar festival at the Kapaleeshwarar Temple in Thirumayilai. Special trains are run when cricket matches are hosted at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk, during Kaanum Pongal festival at Marina Beach, and during bus strikes.

As the MRTS system is not fully integrated with other modes of transportation in the city, access to the stations is an issue. As per a survey conducted in 2012, the public called for special focus on pedestrian facilities that would provide access to MRTS stations from nearby roads and bus stops, as well as identifying new feeder routes for the network. Post the completion of the under construction extension, the MRTS system will be connected to the Suburban Railway and the Metro. This would enable commuters to access the railway grid of the different operational rail systems and facilitate improved connectivity from the stations on the MRTS network. The proposed extension up to St. Thomas Mount is expected to increase patronage from people working in the IT establishments, residences and other offices located close to the MRTS network.

=== Finances ===
In a 10 month period in 2009–10, the MRTS earned a revenue of with coming from ticketing sales. It had operating expenses of about , which translated to net loss of more than . , the MRTS registered revenues of annually. With estimated operational expenses of about , the annual loss widened to . A major contributor to the losses is the revenue deficit due to subsidised cheaper fares offered by the Southern Railway, which runs the service.

<doc id="940486" wikidata="Q3177902" url="?curid=940486" title="Redemption game">
<text>Redemption games are typically arcade games of skill that reward the player proportionally to their score in the game. The reward most often comes in the form of tickets, with more tickets being awarded for higher scores. These tickets can then be redeemed (hence the name) at a central location for prizes. The most inexpensive prizes (candy, small plastic or rubber toys) may require only a small number of tickets to acquire, while the most expensive ones (skateboards, low-end electronics) may require several thousand. In general, the amount of money spent to win enough tickets for a given prize will exceed the value of the prize itself. Some redemption games, such as Flamin&#x27; Finger, involve elements of chance, which can be set by the operator.

A variation on the ticket-based redemption game is the merchandiser, which directly displays and dispenses merchandise, rather than dispensing tickets which are then redeemed for prizes. Arcade games that offer no prizes are known as non-redemption games.

Redemption games can be seen as the modern successor to carnival games, as the same general principles apply.

== Regulation ==
===North America===
==== New Jersey ====
The state of New Jersey in the United States is the first to prohibit redemption games that distribute tickets based on a player&#x27;s skill without a valid Amusements License Issued by the State. Games must either dispense no tickets or a fixed number of tickets per play. For example, Chuck E. Cheese establishments located in these regions have their redemption games configured to always dispense four tickets per play, regardless of a player&#x27;s skill level.

==== Florida ====
In April 2013, the state of Florida passed legislation designed to target sweepstakes parlors—among other changes, it prevents gambling machines from awarding prizes more than $0.75 in value, and prohibits them from accepting cards or bills as payment. Although the law does contain specific distinctions meant to exclude arcade redemption games from its scope, the law attracted concern from the arcade industry, who felt that it could be interpreted to ban their operation—especially at facilities that use card-based systems for credits rather than tokens. In January 2015, as a cautionary measure, Disney Parks removed redemption and claw machines from the arcades of its Florida resorts: representatives of the company have supported attempts to clarify the wording of the sweepstakes parlor ban to reduce its potential effects on arcades.

====North Carolina====
In North Carolina, table-mounted video games known as &quot;fish games&quot; are illegal in Greensboro, North Carolina because they are machines which result in a cash payout, not allowed &quot;irrespective of whether the game requires skill or dexterity.&quot; After a 2017 court ruling, &quot;fish arcades&quot; were later determined to be gambling establishments and therefore illegal elsewhere. Two software companies filed an injunction against the sheriff&#x27;s office in Rowan County on January 21, 2020 claiming gaming experts consider the businesses cited to be offering &quot;games of skill&quot;.

==== Quebec ====
In the Canadian province of Quebec, arcades must pay operator fees and an additional fee per machine. If a game meets certain criteria, it may offer &quot;free games or additional game time&quot; as a prize. Examples include the Extra Stage mechanism in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, or a racing game that awards a free race to those in first place. Only a game of skill, such as a claw crane, may distribute another type of prize. Arcade games cannot distribute prizes based on luck, as most redemption games do. This led to arcade chains such as Xscape and Cinémas Guzzo offering only traditional arcade games and games of skill.

In 2019, the Quebec government agreed to update the legislation regarding arcade games in the province, with the new laws taking effect in October 2019. Following this announcement, Canadian movie theater chain Cineplex Entertainment announced that it would be opening up a new location in Montreal&#x27;s soon-to-be-constructed Royalmount mega mall complete with a restaurant, a VIP theater for adults aged 18 and over, and an arcade area called &quot;The Rec Room&quot;, with the latter being the first of its kind in Quebec. The Rec Room will feature both skill- and luck-based arcade games in which visitors can earn credits and exchange them for prizes. The new theater is expected to open in 2022.

==Legacy==
As revenue from traditional arcade games started to decline in the latter half of the 1990s due to competition from home game consoles and the Internet, arcade operators began to rely on the income from redemption and merchandiser games to remain profitable. These games were often much less expensive to purchase, and had a better return on investment than video games. The revenue from video games would diminish as game titles would get released to the home marketredemption games did not have that problem. Redemption and merchandiser games could generate good revenue for many years, compared to months for most video games. Redemption games have allowed many arcades to remain profitable in an ever-changing entertainment market.

==Examples==
Many redemption games are based on popular media such as board games and mobile games.

===Board games===
*Connect 4
*Hungry Hungry Hippos
*Monopoly

===Game shows===
*Deal or No Deal (with versions based on the American and British game shows for America and the UK respectively)
*The Price Is Right
*Wheel of Fortune

===Mobile games===
*Angry Birds
*Candy Crush Saga
*Crossy Road
*Cut the Rope
*Doodle Jump
*Flappy Bird
*Fruit Ninja
*Pop the Lock
*Temple Run

===Other games===
*Alien Command
*Colorama
*Cyclone
*Hoop it Up
*Jumpin&#x27; Jackpot
*Magic Mr. X
*Pirate&#x27;s Gold
*Slam-A-Winner
*Wheel &#x27;M In

==Pachinko==
A Japanese form of redemption game is pachinko, which features small metal balls which are both used in play and used for redemption, instead of tickets. Pachinko is primarily or entirely a game of chance.

<text>Inked is a tattoo lifestyle digital and print media company that bills itself as the outsiders&#x27; insider media. Covering music, fashion, art, sports and the rest of the lifestyle of the tattooed, &quot;Inked&quot;, like Vice, has evolved from newsstands to a large-scale digital media company. Tattooed women like Kat Von D, Avril Lavigne, Diablo Cody, Eve and Malin Akerman have appeared on &quot;Inked&quot;&#x27;s cover. Among the celebrities who have sat down with &quot;Inked&quot; are Ozzy Osbourne, Lil Pump, Tracy Morgan, Slash, Kid Cudi and Billie Joe Armstrong. &quot;Inked&quot; also covers tattoo artists; they immortalize the best in their Icon feature through which the likes of Don Ed Hardy, Horiyoshi III and Ami James have been honored.

==History and profile==
&quot;Inked&quot; debuted in late 2000 and is published quarterly. In 2006, the magazine was purchased by Downtown Media Group. Pinchazo Publishing Group Inc acquired &quot;Inked&quot; in August 2007. The company hired creative director Todd Weinberger to redesign the magazine, then brought on editor Jason Buhrmester. Upon Burhmester&#x27;s departure in the spring of 2010 Rocky Rakovic was tapped as Editor. Rakovic brought in celebrity contributors like Adam Levine, Jessica White and Adam Goldberg. Photographers such as Terry Richardson, Ellen Stagg and Warwick Saint have shot for &quot;Inked&quot;. In 2022, Inked was purchased by Inked Holding LLC, an entity owned by businessmen and philanthropists Darrin Austin and Jason Miller, and was subsequently transformed to align with today’s mainstream tattoo enthusiast, incorporating significant improvements in both its editorial and visual presentation. Inked stands as the most recognizable brand in the tattoo industry, setting trends, and commanding the largest presence worldwide. The company also maintains a substantial eCommerce and licensing business.

<text>Amanda Meta Marshall (born August 29, 1972) is a Canadian Juno award winning pop-rock singer and songwriter. She has released four studio albums; the first was certified diamond in Canada, with the second and third certified 3× platinum and platinum respectively. She is best known for her 1996 single, &quot;Birmingham&quot;, which reached number 3 in Canada and was her only song to reach the US charts.

==Early life==
Marshall was born in Toronto, Ontario.
She grew up an only child, in her own words, &quot;the product of an interracial marriage&quot;: her mother is from Trinidad, her father is white. In several of her songs, Marshall has reflected on her racial identity &quot;as a woman who looks white but is actually black&quot;.

Marshall studied music extensively during her childhood, including at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. While performing on the Queen Street West bar scene in her teens, she met guitarist Jeff Healey, who was struck by her powerful voice and took her on tour for a long time.

==Career==
===Debut album and critical success===
Marshall signed a recording contract with Metalblade Records in 1991, but both parties agreed that they were not a good fit and went their separate ways. In 1994, Marshall signed to Epic Records, and contributed to the Neil Young tribute album &quot;Borrowed Tunes: A Tribute to Neil Young&quot; the same year. Her debut album &quot;Amanda Marshall&quot; was released the following year in 1995. The album was a major success in Canada, generating a great deal of airplay and spawning six Top 40 hits—&quot;Let It Rain&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;, &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot;, and &quot;Birmingham&quot;, her most successful hit in Canada and the only song to reach the US charts, charting at number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1996, Marshall&#x27;s song &quot;This Could Take All Night&quot; was included in the original soundtrack of &quot;Tin Cup&quot;. In 1997, Marshall&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Okay&quot; was included in the original soundtrack of &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;.

Amanda&#x27;s career got a huge boost when Elton John named her as an artist he was then-currently listening to when he appeared on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;.

===1999–2000: &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Child&quot; and further success===
In 1999, she released a successful follow-up album, &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Child&quot;. It followed in the same vein as her debut, with a mix of soulful pop songs and ballads, characterizing her powerful voice. Her song &quot;Ride&quot; from that album was featured in the film &quot;The Replacements&quot; and on its soundtrack. In autumn 1999, she supported Whitney Houston on the European leg of her My Love Is Your Love World Tour. Another single from that album, &quot;Believe In You&quot;, a differently composed variant remix the second Atlantis level music from the video game &quot;Glover&quot;, was featured on one episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and on its soundtrack as well as the 2002 direct-to-video film &quot;Kermit&#x27;s Swamp Years&quot;, while Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi was the guest guitarist on the track &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me&quot;. She also co wrote a song &quot;Right Here All Along&quot; with Carole King, who also performed background vocals on the track. She was nominated as best songwriter at the 2000 Juno Awards.

===2001–2023: &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got a Story&quot; and further releases===
In 2001, Marshall released her third album, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got a Story&quot;. It marked a change in style and sound for Marshall, with a noticeable R&amp;B influence. Her singles &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got a Story&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning After&quot; received some Canadian airplay, and for the album, Marshall worked with the likes of Peter Asher and Billy Mann.

Marshall&#x27;s absence from the music scene was due to legal battles with her record label after she fired her management in 2002. Those fights were not resolved for about 12 years.

In 2003, she released a greatest hits album entitled &quot;Intermission: The Singles Collection&quot;, which was followed by another greatest hits album, &quot;Collections&quot;, in 2006. In 2008, yet another greatest hits album, &quot;The Steel Box Collection&quot;, was released.

In a 2012 radio interview, Marshall announced that she was working on a new album. In the interview, she explained to the radio host that &quot;a new CD is in the works&quot;, and that she was &quot;hopeful&quot; of its release in 2013, however this did not eventuate. In an article, she said that the record was &quot;70% done&quot;.

===2023–present: &quot;Heavy Lifting&quot;===
On March 27, 2023, Marshall announced her new album, &quot;Heavy Lifting&quot;, which was released on June 9, 2023, with &quot;Rainbows in Gasoline&quot; as the focus track, along with a Canada-wide tour. She released the first single from that album, &quot;I Hope She Cheats&quot;, a cover of Marsha Ambrosius&#x27;s &quot;Hope She Cheats on You (With a Basketball Player)&quot;, on March 31, 2023. She then released her second single from that album, &quot;Dawgcatcher&quot;, on May 18, 2023. On June 16, 2023, during her tour, Marshall performed 2 nights at Massey Hall in Toronto.

The album won the Juno Award for Adult Contemporary Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2024.

<text>CLISP is an implementation of the programming language Common Lisp originally developed by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll for the Atari ST. Today it supports the Unix and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

CLISP includes an interpreter, a bytecode compiler, debugger, socket interface, high-level foreign language interface, strong internationalization support, and two object systems: Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) and metaobject protocol (MOP).

It is written in C and Common Lisp. It is now part of the GNU Project and is free software, available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

==History==
Haible did not originally intend to distribute CLISP under the GPL, but in a well-publicised email exchange with Richard Stallman, he eventually agreed to do so. The issue at stake was whether CLISP was a derivative work of the GNU readline library.

==Ports==
CLISP is extremely portable, running on almost all Unix-based operating systems as well as on Microsoft Windows. Although interpreting bytecode is usually slower than running compiled native binaries, this is not always a major issue (especially in applications like Web development where I/O is the bottleneck). CLISP is also easier to set up than other popular FOSS Common Lisps such as SBCL.

==Adoption==
Paul Graham used CLISP to run the software for his Viaweb startup. Viaweb was an early web application; portions of it still exist as Yahoo! Stores, the base for Yahoo Shopping .

Conrad Barski&#x27;s Land of Lisp uses some CLISP-specific functions in the textbook exercises.

<doc id="940498" wikidata="Q3145270" url="?curid=940498" title="The Ottawa Hospital">
<text>The Ottawa Hospital () is a hospital system in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The system was formed through the merger of the former Grace Hospital, Ottawa Riverside Hospital, Ottawa General Hospital and Ottawa Civic Hospital. The system is affiliated with the University of Ottawa, and its three campuses are all non-profit, public teaching hospitals (the University of Ottawa Heart Institute is located at the hospital&#x27;s Civic Campus).

The Ottawa Hospital&#x27;s Civic Campus is also one of the two trauma centres serving Eastern Ontario and southern Quebec. The other is the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, accommodating juvenile and adolescent patients.

The Ottawa Hospital&#x27;s General Campus is home to the Ottawa Hospital Cancer Center, the main site of the Ottawa Hospital Cancer Program and the Champlain Regional Cancer Program. This program runs in conjunction with the Irving Greenberg Family Cancer Centre located at the Queensway Carleton Hospital, located on the western side of Ottawa, also operated by the Ottawa Hospital. The General Campus provides specialized in and outpatient services for hematological diseases, as well as radiation and medical oncology.

== Research ==
The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) is a non-profit academic health research institute that is part of The Ottawa Hospital, and a major part of the University of Ottawa Faculties of Medicine and Health Science. 

Formed on April 1, 2001, by the merger of the Loeb Health Research Institute and the Ottawa Health Research Institute, the OHRI is a multi-campus facility with more than 2,000 scientists, clinician investigators, trainees and staff. These researchers are studying more than a hundred different diseases, conditions and specialties with an overall focus on translating discoveries and knowledge into better health. 

==Riverside Hospital of Ottawa==
The Ottawa Hospital&#x27;s Riverside Campus is one of three main campuses of The Ottawa Hospital – along with the Civic and General campuses, and is the only campus that does not admit patients and has no emergency department. The facility operates for out-patient treatment and procedures during the day Monday - Friday.

The Riverside Hospital of Ottawa first opened in 1967 on Riverside Drive close to where the current General campus and the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario is located on Smyth Road. On 1 April 1998 the hospital was amalgamated with the Civic Hospital and the General Hospital into The Ottawa Hospital.

The hospital is also the Riverside station for OC Transpo.

The hospital is home to the Kidney Research Centre, a centre within the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. The centre was established in 2000 and is the first place in Canada dedicated to kidney research.

In addition, the hospital is home to the Shirley E. Greenberg Women&#x27;s Health Centre. The centre is dedicated to research, education, and helping women improve their health. The centre sees 30,000 patients a year.

===Book===
The book &quot;Making waves: a history of the Riverside Hospital of Ottawa&quot; recounts the hospital&#x27;s long history.

==Helipads==
The General Campus shares the ground level helipad located next to CHEO for ground ambulance transfers to the General.

There is a helipad located at the hospital&#x27;s Civic Campus located across Carling Avenue. The helipad is used by Medevac as the majority of landings take place there as the Civic Campus is the site of Ottawa&#x27;s Level 1 Trauma Centre for adults.

<text>Moltke is a lunar impact crater near the southern edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It is a small, bowl-shaped crater surrounded by a bright halo of higher-albedo material. Just to the south lies the rille system named Rimae Hypatia. These follow a course running roughly east-southeast to west-northwest, and have a length of approximately 180 kilometers.

About 50 kilometers to the northwest of this crater is Tranquility Base, the 1969 landing site of Apollo 11.

The crater is named after German army general and author Helmuth von Moltke the Elder.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Moltke.

Moltke B was informally called &quot;Little Moltke&quot; by the Apollo 10 and Apollo 11 crews.

<text>Philip John Neville (born 21 January 1977) is an English football manager and former player who is the current head coach of Major League Soccer club Portland Timbers. He is also the co-owner of Salford City, along with several of his former Manchester United teammates.

After ten years as a professional with Manchester United, during which time he won six Premier League titles, three FA Cups, three FA Charity Shields, the Intercontinental Cup and the Champions League, he joined Everton in 2005, where he spent the final eight years of his playing career. Neville also played for England 59 times between 1996 and 2007, representing the nation at three European Championships. He could play in defence or midfield; due to this versatility, he operated in a number of different positions throughout his career, but was most often used as a left-back.

After earning his UEFA B Coaching Licence, Neville began his coaching career in 2012, filling in for Stuart Pearce with the England under-21s. He then worked as a coach at Manchester United, and as assistant manager to his brother Gary at Valencia in La Liga. On 23 January 2018, Neville was appointed head coach of the England women&#x27;s team. He led the &quot;Lionesses&quot; to fourth place at the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===

Born in Bury, Greater Manchester, Neville attended Elton High School, where he captained the football team for five years. Along with brother Gary, he joined the Manchester United Academy, signing associate schoolboy forms in September 1990. In the 1992–93 season, he played 23 times for the club&#x27;s junior teams, including four times in the FA Youth Cup as the club attempted to defend the title Gary had won the previous season; Neville appeared alongside his brother in the second leg of the 1993 Youth Cup final, but they were unable to overturn a 2–0 deficit from the first leg at Old Trafford, and Leeds won 4–1 on aggregate. In July 1993, Neville signed a trainee contract with the club, and in October that year he made his debut for the reserve team, coming on for Darren Ferguson in a 2–0 win over Everton in The Central League. He went on to make eight appearances for the reserves in the 1993–94 season, as well as a further 31 for the junior teams, culminating in him winning the Jimmy Murphy Player of the Year Award in May 1994, followed by his first professional contract in June.

Neville made his senior debut for Manchester United on 28 January 1995 in a 5–2 win at home to Wrexham in the fourth round of the 1994–95 FA Cup. His league debut came two weeks later, when he started against Manchester City in the Manchester derby at Maine Road. He made one more first-team appearance in 1994–95, coming on as a substitute in a 1–0 win at home to Sheffield Wednesday. The following week, he captained United in both legs of the Youth Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur; after a 2–1 loss at White Hart Lane and a 1–0 win at Old Trafford, the tie came down to penalties; Neville missed his kick, but two misses from Spurs meant United won the shoot-out 4–3 to claim their second Youth Cup title in four seasons.

Neville&#x27;s graduation and eventual establishment in the first-team meant he became known as one of &quot;Fergie&#x27;s Fledglings&quot;. On 19 August 1995, in the first game of the following season, he was substituted at half-time in a 3–1 loss at Aston Villa; the match is remembered for pundit Alan Hansen&#x27;s &quot;You can&#x27;t win anything with kids&quot; comment on Manchester United, who went on to win the double. He did not play at left-back frequently due to the presence of Denis Irwin; for some time he played at right-back while his brother played in central defence, and in the 1996 FA Cup Final victory against Liverpool he played this position while Gary was an unused substitute.

While at Manchester United, he was booked many times, such as in the 2002–03 season when he received 13 yellow cards, despite only starting 35 competitive games. In September 2003, Neville received a warning from The Football Association regarding his future conduct for his behaviour after Manchester United&#x27;s game against rival side Arsenal.

While at Old Trafford, Neville helped United win six Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the UEFA Champions League.

===Everton===

====Transfers and beginnings====

On 4 August 2005, Neville joined Everton on a five-year contract for a fee in excess of £3 million. He made his debut in a UEFA Champions League qualifier against Villarreal, coming face-to-face with his former Manchester United colleague Diego Forlán. The following weekend, Neville made his Premier League debut for the Toffees, against Manchester United; The match marked the first time Phil and brother Gary had played for opposing teams.

====Captaincy====
Neville&#x27;s attitude, work rate and willingness to play anywhere saw him become one of manager David Moyes&#x27; favourites. On 8 August 2006, Neville was announced as vice-captain to David Weir, and – on Weir&#x27;s departure to Rangers in January 2007 – he became the club captain. In the Manchester United–Everton match on 29 November 2006, Phil and his brother Gary became the first siblings to captain their respective clubs against each other in the Premier League.

Neville commented in the press about the first ever red cards of his long career (he never received any playing for Manchester United), claiming that he would perhaps not have been booked in a game against Fulham if he had been playing for United. However, he finished with more cards than any other Premier League player in 2005–06 (including another red soon after his first). Neville scored his first goal for Everton in a 3–0 Premier League victory against Newcastle United on 30 December 2006.
On 30 March 2008, Neville was assaulted by a Liverpool fan as he took a throw-in during the 1–0 Merseyside derby Premier League defeat at Anfield. On 24 April, the fan, 48-year-old Michael Blackmore, was later banned from all matches in England and Wales for three years after admitting common assault.

====Later years and retirement====
On 19 April 2009, Neville scored his penalty to help knock out his former club, Manchester United, in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, he sent the keeper the wrong way, putting it low to the keeper&#x27;s right. On 19 February 2011, Neville scored the winning penalty in the penalty shoot-out against Chelsea to knock them out of the FA Cup, after a 1–1 draw at Stamford Bridge. On 9 April 2011, Neville scored against Wolves, his 12th senior goal and his first in three years. On 21 September, Neville scored in the League Cup game against West Bromwich Albion, this time a clinical effort, which was the deciding goal in the game. The goal was judged to be the Everton&#x27;s goal of the season at the club&#x27;s end of season awards.

On 9 April 2013, he announced that he would leave Everton at the end of the season when his contract ended. He subsequently announced his retirement from professional football.

==International career==
Neville was regularly picked for England squads, making his debut against China on 23 May 1996. He played alongside his brother in this match; they had appeared together in the 1996 FA Cup Final two weeks earlier and thus were the first pair of brothers to play together in an FA Cup-final winning side and for England in the same season since Hubert and Francis Heron in 1876, 120 years earlier.

He was only briefly a regular first-choice player for the side, as a left-back in 2000 under Kevin Keegan&#x27;s management. Under his successor Sven-Göran Eriksson, Ashley Cole was the preferred left back, followed by Wayne Bridge. Neville once briefly captained the side in a friendly match (a game in which England fielded four different captains). Despite having been in the England squad at the 1996, 2000 and 2004 European Championships, and having 59 England caps (23 as a substitute), Neville was never in an England World Cup squad.

Neville&#x27;s England career included the honour of being the youngest member of Terry Venables&#x27; squad for Euro 96, though he never kicked a ball (his brother played in every match until the semi-finals). He was one of the players omitted at the last minute by Glenn Hoddle when he was selecting his final 22 for the 1998 World Cup, Hoddle&#x27;s decision left Neville in tears, though media attention was almost entirely devoted to the exclusion of another player, Paul Gascoigne. Neville revealed in an interview that Gascoigne, not usually noted for his maturity, took the younger Neville brother under his wing and consoled him.

Keegan played Neville at left-back in Euro 2000; Neville received criticism and a large proportion of blame for England&#x27;s exit, when he committed a late foul on Viorel Moldovan, leading to a penalty for Romania, which Ionel Ganea scored to win the match.

Neither of the Nevilles went to the 2002 World Cup – Phil was left out of the 23-man squad, while Gary was injured. Both were back in the squad for Euro 2004. The brothers played together for England for the first time in seven years in a friendly against Spain on 7 February 2007, which England lost 1–0. They hold the record number of England appearances by a pair of brothers (142) and the most starts in the same England team by two brothers (31).

Phil Neville was not included in Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s squad for the 2006 World Cup as Eriksson wanted to give young players a chance. However, he was drafted into Eriksson&#x27;s stand-by group of players after Nigel Reo-Coker withdrew through injury. Neville remained in the England squad with new England manager Steve McClaren and started at right-back in September 2006 against Andorra. He was not called up after 2007.

==Style of play==
Neville was primarily known for his work-rate and versatility as a footballer, and was capable of playing in several defensive and midfield positions; he was usually deployed as either a full-back or wing-back, and was capable of playing on the left side, as well as the right, despite being naturally right-footed; he was even able to play as a central midfielder. Although he was not the most spectacular or offensive-minded defender, and was occasionally criticised by pundits for his lack of pace, as well as his limited passing ability and skill on the ball, he was known to be a consistent player from a defensive standpoint, who also stood out for his leadership qualities. However, he also drew criticism in the media for his uncompromising nature and tendency to pick up cards. In 2010, Varun Mathure of &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; described him as one of the most underrated players in the Premier League.

==Managerial career==

Neville holds a UEFA Pro Licence. In February 2012, it was reported that Neville would help England&#x27;s Under-21s coaching staff in the absence of Stuart Pearce in the Under-21 European Championship qualifier against Belgium. The Everton captain received a special dispensation to help Brian Eastick prepare the side for the game at the Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough as Pearce would be in charge of the senior team in the friendly against the Netherlands at Wembley. England defeated Belgium 4–0. Continuing his work with the England under-21 side, in March 2013 it was announced that Neville would join the coaching staff of the England under-21s for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.

In February 2013, Neville was being considered for the England U20 managerial position for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In May 2013, Neville was interviewed by Bill Kenwright for the vacant manager&#x27;s role at Everton, but the job went to Roberto Martínez. On 4 July 2013, Neville became first-team coach of Manchester United, where he would be reunited with manager David Moyes. It was announced on the same day Moyes named Ryan Giggs as player/coach.

In 2014, it was announced that Neville, along with fellow Manchester United players Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt had agreed a deal to purchase Salford City ahead of the 2014–15 season. with plans to get the club to the Football League. The group announced they would take part in a special friendly, with Salford facing a Class of &#x27;92 team. On 22 September, the group agreed to sell a 50% stake in the club to billionaire Peter Lim. Neville and Scholes briefly took charge of Salford City in a 2–1 home win over Kendal Town, following the sacking of Phil Power.

Neville joined La Liga side Valencia, also owned by Lim, as a coach under manager Nuno Espírito Santo in July 2015. On 30 November, after the resignation of Nuno, Neville was named as assistant to interim coach Voro, before his brother took the managerial position two days later.

===England Women===

On 23 January 2018, Neville was appointed head coach of the England women&#x27;s national team, signing a contract that would run to the end of UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2021.

Neville made his England managerial debut at the 2018 SheBelieves Cup, an annual invitational tournament held in the United States. On 1 March 2018, England won their opening game against France 4–1 before a 2–2 draw against Germany put the Lionesses in a position to win the competition with a victory in the final game against hosts United States. However, a 1–0 defeat saw them finish in second place. After an undefeated 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup qualification campaign, England returned to the SheBelieves tournament in 2019, this time facing Brazil and Japan as well as hosts United States again. A 2–1 victory over Brazil in the opening game and a 2–2 draw with the United States meant England won the tournament for the first time by defeating Japan 3–0 in the third game, even with the United States still to play their final game against Brazil.

England qualified for the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in France on 31 August 2018, with a 3–0 win over Wales.

Neville&#x27;s England side finished first in Group D, with wins against Scotland, Argentina and Japan. After back-to-back 3–0 wins against Cameroon and Norway, England reached their second consecutive Women&#x27;s World Cup semi-final and also secured Team GB one of the three qualifying places allocated to UEFA for the 2020 Summer Olympics. On 2 July 2019, England lost 2–1 to the United States in the semi-finals. Four days later, following a 2–1 defeat to Sweden in the third place play-off, England ended the World Cup in fourth place. He came under fire for his postgame comments, calling the bronze medal match a &quot;nonsense game.&quot;

On 30 June 2019, the FA announced that Neville would be appointed manager of Team GB Women for the 2020 Summer Olympics following England&#x27;s successful de facto qualification performance at the 2019 World Cup.

In the wake of the World Cup exit, England&#x27;s form dropped as the Lionesses struggled in a series of friendlies to end the year including a 2–1 defeat by Germany at Wembley Stadium on 9 November 2019. The game set a new record attendance for an England women&#x27;s match at 77,768. The poor run continued into 2020 as England failed to defend their title at the 2020 SheBelieves Cup in March. Losses to the United States and Spain made it seven defeats in 11 games, the team&#x27;s worst stretch since 2003, mounting further pressure on Neville who admitted he was personally responsible for England&#x27;s &quot;unacceptable&quot; form amid increased media scrutiny. On 22 April 2020, Neville announced he would be leaving his position as manager in July 2021 when his contract was due to expire. As Euro 2021, set to be hosted in England, was pushed back a year to 2022 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Neville would no longer lead the team at the tournament. Despite initially stating he would see out his contract, Neville stepped down as manager of England, and Team GB on 18 January 2021 amid speculation linking him to the vacant Inter Miami CF job.

=== Inter Miami ===

On 18 January 2021, Neville was appointed as the head coach of Inter Miami CF, a club owned by his former Manchester United teammate and current Salford City co-owner David Beckham. He made his debut on 18 April as the team lost 3–2 at home to LA Galaxy in their season opener. After twelve games, Inter Miami had won just two games and had the worst record in MLS. In October, he was fined by MLS for calling for an investigation into referees&#x27; calls against his team, while on the pitch his team had their second six-game losing run of the season. The team finished their debut season 11th of 14 in the Eastern Conference.

In Inter Miami&#x27;s first season of the U.S. Open Cup in 2022, Neville led them to the last 16 before a penalty shootout loss at Florida neighbours Orlando City SC on 25 May. In his second MLS season as head coach, the club reached the MLS Cup playoffs for the first time in their history by finishing sixth in the Eastern Conference, before a 3–0 loss at New York City FC in the first round on 17 October 2022. On 7 November, he extended his contract.

On 1 June 2023, Inter Miami announced that the club had parted ways with Neville. At the time, the club was in last place in the Eastern Conference. &quot;Sometimes in this game we have to make the toughest decisions and sadly we feel the time is right to make a change,&quot; said Beckham.

===Canada===
Shortly after departing Miami, Neville was announced to be joining John Herdman&#x27;s staff ahead of Canada&#x27;s participation in the 2023 CONCACAF Nations League final and the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

===Portland Timbers===

On 6 November 2023, Neville was named the head coach of the Portland Timbers on a contract that runs through the 2026 MLS season. His hiring was criticized by fans and the team&#x27;s largest supporters group due to past sexist remarks.

==Media career==
He regularly appears as a pundit on football radio commentaries, and has appeared as a pundit on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; programme. In November 2010, he became a top-trending Twitter term after a strong performance against Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Gareth Bale led to a tongue-in-cheek &quot;Chuck Norris&quot;-style internet phenomenon.

Neville was employed by BBC One as a commentator and pundit during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. His commentary of the England–Italy match on 14 June attracted 445 complaints for his &quot;lack of emotion and &#x27;monotone style&#x27;&quot;. He reflected on this in an online article by stating &quot;I played it back the next day and it did not sound like it was me commentating. I was trying to be somebody I wasn&#x27;t, and I knew I could do better than that&quot;.

The BBC received further complaints for Neville&#x27;s comments in January 2015, after Arsenal&#x27;s Tomáš Rosický played a pass while looking in another direction; Neville said that if he were playing against a player doing that in training, he would deliberately injure that player. He admitted making an unacceptable comment, while the BBC stated that the tone of discussion was light-hearted enough to suggest Neville was not endorsing violence.

After departing from Valencia in 2016 he joined Sky Sports as a pundit for their coverage of the Premier League along with his brother Gary, who rejoined.

==Personal life==

Neville attended Elton High School with his siblings. While in school, he captained his school football team throughout the whole five years he was there. Neville was also a talented cricketer in his youth, and a contemporary of England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff in Lancashire&#x27;s Under-19 side, captaining England Under-15s. Neville holds the record for being the youngest player to play for Lancashire&#x27;s second XI at age 15. Flintoff described Neville as a &quot;cricketing genius&quot; whose talents could have compared to Ricky Ponting or Sachin Tendulkar, if he had chosen a cricket career.

Neville is the younger brother of fellow former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, and the twin brother of former international and former England netball head coach Tracey Neville. His father, Neville Neville, was commercial director of Football League club Bury. His mother Jill used to play netball in the local leagues, and worked as General Manager and Club Secretary for Bury.

Neville is married to Julie (née Killilea); the couple have a son, Harvey, and a daughter, Isabella. Harvey is currently a player with Inter Miami and has represented the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team, being eligible despite being born in England as Neville&#x27;s wife is of Irish descent.

He made the property headlines in April 2008, when he struggled to sell his £4 million mansion in Lancashire. In May 2009, he accepted a £2.6 million cash offer for the house from local businessman Matthew Greensmith.

Neville became vegetarian in 2014, after a challenge from his wife to try the diet for two weeks. He said in a PETA video that &quot;I started to feel healthier, leaner. I started to feel great.&quot;
===Philanthropy===
Neville&#x27;s daughter Isabella has cerebral palsy, which has led to Neville becoming an ambassador of Bliss, the special care baby charity, and a patron of Royal Manchester Children&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s New Children&#x27;s Hospital Appeal. Neville has also raised money for the Good Life Orphanage in Kenya and the Warrington Youth Club. Neville co-founded Foundation 92 with Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, and Paul Scholes, all teammates who met playing for Manchester United in 1992. The organization supports wellbeing and outreach programs for the Salford and Greater Manchester community.

<text>The South Western Ghats montane rain forests is an ecoregion in South India, covering the southern portion of the Western Ghats in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu at elevations from . Annual rainfall in this ecoregion exceeds .

==Setting==
The ecoregion is the most species rich in peninsular India, and is home to numerous endemic species. It covers an area of . It is estimated that two-thirds of the original forests have been cleared, and only 3,200 square kilometers, or 15% of the intact area, is protected.

The southern portion of the Western Ghats contains the highest peaks in the range, notably Anamudi in Kerala, at 2695 meters elevation. The Ghats intercept the moisture-laden monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, and the average annual precipitation exceeds 2,800 mm. The northeast monsoon from October to November supplements the June to September southwest monsoon. The South Western Ghats are the wettest portion of peninsular India, and are surrounded by drier ecoregions to the east and north.

==Protected areas==
As of 1997, this ecoregion encompassed the following 16 protected areas with an area of :
*in Karnataka: Talakaveri Wildlife Sanctuary with , Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary with , Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary with 
*in Kerala: Periyar National Park with , Shenduruny Wildlife Sanctuary with , Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary with , Karimpuzha National Park with , Silent Valley National Park with , Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary with , Eravikulam National Park with , Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary with , Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary with 
*in Tamil Nadu: Anamalai Tiger Reserve with , Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve with , Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary with and Mukurthi National Park with 
As of 2017, the total size of protected areas within this ecoregion amounted to , equivalent to 27% of the ecoregion&#x27;s extent. Another 62% is forested but outside protected areas.

Several of the protected areas in the northern portion are included within the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, and the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve covers the southern portion.

==Flora==

The cool and moist climate, high rainfall, and variety of microclimates brought about by differences in elevation and exposure supports lush and diverse forests; 35% of the plant species are endemic to the ecoregion. Moist evergreen montane forests are the predominant habitat type. The montane evergreen forests support a great diversity of species ( Animals and plants ). The trees generally form a canopy at 15 to 20 m, and the forests are multistoried and rich in epiphytes, especially orchids. Characteristic canopy trees are &quot;Cullenia exarillata&quot;, &quot;Mesua ferrea&quot;, &quot;Palaquium ellipticum&quot;, &quot;Gluta travancorica&quot;, and &quot;Nageia wallichiana&quot;. &quot;Nageia&quot; is a podocarp conifer with origins in the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, of which India was formerly part, and a number of other plants in the ecoregion have Gondwana origins. Other evergreen tree species of the montane forest include &quot;Calophyllum austroindicum&quot;, &quot;Garcinia rubroechinata&quot;, &quot;Garcinia travancorica&quot;, &quot;Diospyros barberi&quot;, &quot;Memecylon subramanii&quot;, &quot;Memecylon gracile&quot;, &quot;Goniothalamus rhynchantherus&quot;, and &quot;Monosis travancorica&quot;.

The other major habitat type in this ecoregion is the shola-grassland complex at elevations of . Shola is a stunted forest with small trees including &quot;Prunus ceylanica&quot;, &quot;Heptapleurum racemosum&quot;, &quot;Chionanthus ramiflorus&quot;, &quot;Syzygium&quot; spp., &quot;Rhododendron arboreum&quot; subsp. &quot;nilagiricum&quot;, &quot;Mahonia napaulensis&quot;, &quot;Elaeocarpus recurvatus&quot;, &quot;Ilex denticulata&quot;, &quot;Magnolia nilagirica&quot;, &quot;Actinodaphne bourdillonii&quot;, and &quot;Litsea wightiana&quot;. The understorey consists of dense shrubs. These shola forest patches are interspersed with montane grasslands characterized by frost- and fire-resistant grass species like &quot;Chrysopogon nodulibarbis&quot;, &quot;Cymbopogon flexuosus&quot;, &quot;Arundinella ciliata&quot;, &quot;Arundinella mesophylla&quot;, &quot;Arundinella tuberculata&quot;, &quot;Themeda tremula&quot;, and &quot;Sehima nervosa&quot;.

==Fauna==

Endemic fauna in this ecoregion include Nilgiri tahr (&quot;Nilgiritragus hylocrius&quot;), Nilgiri pipit (&quot;Anthus nilghiriensis&quot;), Nilgiri laughingthrush (&quot;Montecincla cachinnans&quot;), broad-tailed grassbird (&quot;Schoenicola platyurus&quot;), Nilgiri long-tailed tree mouse (&quot;Vandeleuria nilagirica&quot;), eight endemic reptile genera encompassing &quot;Brachyophidium&quot;, &quot;Dravidogecko&quot;, &quot;Melanophidium&quot;, &quot;Plectrurus&quot;, Ristella, Salea, &quot;Teretrurus&quot; and &quot;Xylophis&quot; with 90 species, and the six amphibian genera &quot;Indotyphlus&quot;, &quot;Melanobatrachus&quot;, &quot;Nannobatrachus&quot;, &quot;Nyctibatrachus&quot;, &quot;Ranixalus&quot; and &quot;Uraeotyphlus&quot;. The ecoregion also hosts Nilgiri langur (&quot;Semnopithecus johnii&quot;), Malabar large-spotted civet (&quot;Viverra civettina&quot;), brown palm civet (&quot;Paradoxurus jerdoni&quot;), Salim Ali&#x27;s fruit bat (&quot;Latidens salimalii&quot;), Nilgiri striped squirrel (&quot;Funambulus sublineatus&quot;) and Layard&#x27;s palm squirrel (&quot;F. layardi&quot;).

<text>Jeffrey Scot Tweedy (born August 25, 1967) is an American musician, singer songwriter, author, and record producer best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the band Wilco. Tweedy, originally from Belleville, Illinois, began his music career in high school with his band The Plebes along with Jay Farrar, also in the band. It became the alternative country band Uncle Tupelo. 

After Uncle Tupelo broke up Tweedy formed Wilco which found critical and commercial success, most notably with &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;. The latter received a Grammy for Best Alternative Album in 2005.

During his career Tweedy has released 20 studio albums including four with Uncle Tupelo, twelve with Wilco, one with his son Spencer, a solo acoustic album, three solo studio albums, along with numerous collaborations with other musicians, most notably &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; with Billy Bragg.

== Early life ==
Tweedy was born in Belleville on August 25, 1967, the fourth child of Bob and JoAnn Tweedy (née Werkmeister). Bob Tweedy (died August 4, 2017) worked for Alton &amp; Southern Railroad in East St. Louis; JoAnn was a kitchen designer. Tweedy grew up with three siblings, older brother Greg Tweedy (he died in 2013), brother Steven Tweedy, and sister Debbie Voll.

Tweedy&#x27;s mother bought him his first guitar when he was six years old, although he did not begin to play it seriously until he was twelve. Apparently Tweedy told people that he knew how to play the guitar once he got his first guitar, even though he did not know how to play. 

When he was twelve, Tweedy was injured in a bicycle accident and was laid up for the summer. He decided to learn how to play a few chords before somebody &quot;called him out&quot; on the lie. On an appearance of &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, he remembered attending an X concert as a youngster in St. Louis. The Replacements opened, and Paul Westerberg, their guitarist and vocalist, fell off the stage while performing. Tweedy recalls thinking &quot;That looks like fun!&quot;

In 1981, when Tweedy was fourteen years old, he befriended Jay Farrar during an English class at Belleville Township High School West. All of the members of Farrar&#x27;s family enjoyed playing music; he already knew rock and roll music very well. By that time, Tweedy was a fan of The Ramones and country music while Farrar enjoyed The Sex Pistols. Tweedy attended Belleville Area College and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

== Career ==

=== Early music ===

In the early 1980s, Tweedy joined The Plebes, a rockabilly band, with brothers Wade and Dade Farrar which Tweedy joined in order to qualify for a battle of the bands competition. They won. Tweedy pushed The Plebes away from the rockabilly music that they had been playing, which caused Dade Farrar to leave the band. The band renamed themselves The Primatives in 1984, taking their name from a song by garage rock band The Groupies. Wade Farrar sang lead vocals and played harmonica, Jay Farrar played guitar, Tweedy played bass guitar, and Mike Heidorn played drums. In late 1986, the band decided to change their name to Uncle Tupelo, because a more popular British band was also using the name &quot;The Primitives&quot;. The Primatives went on hiatus in 1986 after Wade Farrar left the band to finish his engineering degree at Southern Illinois University. While waiting for Wade to return from campus, Farrar, Tweedy, and Heidorn formed Uncle Tupelo.

=== Uncle Tupelo (1987–1994) ===

At his parents&#x27; request, Tweedy attended several universities, but dropped out of all of them to concentrate on Uncle Tupelo. While as a record store clerk at Euclid Records in St. Louis, Tweedy met Tony Margherita. After Margherita saw the band perform at an acoustic concert in 1988, he decided to become the band&#x27;s manager. The band began playing regular shows at Cicero&#x27;s basement bar in the Delmar Loop near Washington University in St. Louis with other bands playing in a similar style. Uncle Tupelo recorded a ten-track demo tape entitled &quot;Not Forever, Just For Now&quot; in 1989, attracting the attention of Giant/Rockville Records. The independent label signed the band, and Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s first album, &quot;No Depression&quot;, was released the next year. The title song, originally performed by the Carter Family, became strongly associated with the alternative country scene, and became the name of an influential alternative country periodical called &quot;No Depression.&quot;

During times when Uncle Tupelo was not touring, Tweedy and Farrar played as Coffee Creek, a short-lived cover band with The Bottle Rockets&#x27; Brian Henneman and Mark Ortmann. Around this time, Tweedy began developing problems with alcohol, leading to tensions between Tweedy and Farrar. While he never refused to play a gig, Tweedy was forced to sit out in place of Henneman at some performances. Tweedy quit drinking entirely after meeting future wife Sue Miller, although he replaced this habit with smoking marijuana. However, after developing a dependence on marijuana, he quickly quit using it, as well. After releasing &quot;Still Feel Gone&quot;, the band formed a friendship with Peter Buck of R.E.M., who produced their third album &quot;March 16–20, 1992&quot; for free. Uncle Tupelo left the Rockville label in favor of Sire Records (Warner) later in 1992 because Rockville refused to pay the band any royalties for their albums. After the signing, Max Johnston and John Stirratt joined the band as Mike Heidorn was replaced by Bill Belzer who was later replaced by Ken Coomer. The five-piece band recorded &quot;Anodyne&quot;, which sold over 150,000 copies and debuted at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart, but was the last album Uncle Tupelo released.

==== Breakup ====
In January 1994, Farrar called Tony Margherita to tell him that the band was breaking up, saying that he was not having any fun in the band anymore and was not getting along with Tweedy. Tweedy was enraged that Farrar decided to break up the band without notifying him, and this led to a series of harsh verbal exchanges. Farrar and Tweedy agreed to a final Uncle Tupelo tour, but the concerts were marred by the two not participating in each other&#x27;s songs. The band decided to play Tweedy&#x27;s &quot;The Long Cut&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, which further distanced Farrar and Tweedy. Farrar began to assemble a new band named Son Volt with Mike Heidorn, bassist Jim Boquist, and his brother Dave Boquist. At the same time, Jeff Tweedy formed Wilco with Stirratt, Johnston, and Coomer.

=== Wilco (1995–present) ===

In 1994, Tweedy formed Wilco with John Stirratt, Max Johnston, and Ken Coomer. Wilco has released twelve albums and found commercial success with their albums &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;, &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; and &quot;Wilco&quot;. The band also released two collaboration albums with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5. Jeff Tweedy has been the recipient of two Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Album for &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;. Tweedy has also participated in a number of side groups including Golden Smog and Loose Fur, published a book of poems, and released a DVD of solo performances. He was originally influenced by punk and country music, but has later reflected more experimental themes in his music.
Wilco signed with Reprise/Warner Bros. Records and began recording &quot;AM&quot; almost as soon as the band was formed. After recording, Tweedy was introduced to Jay Bennett, who then joined the band. Also during this time, Tweedy quit smoking marijuana after a particularly bad experience with some cannabis brownies. &quot;A.M.&quot; did not fare as well commercially in comparison to Son Volt&#x27;s first album, only reaching number 27 on the Heatseekers chart while Son Volt&#x27;s debut &quot;Trace&quot; hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum invited Tweedy to join him in a supergroup named Golden Smog with Gary Louris and Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run, and Noah Levy of The Honeydogs. Under the pseudonym Scott Summit, Tweedy released &quot;Down by the Old Mainstream&quot; with Golden Smog in 1996.

Tweedy and Wilco began to explore new styles and broke from the style of previous recordings on the seminal sprawling double album &quot;Being There&quot; in 1996. Tweedy did not write music for many of the songs ahead of time, and welcomed unexpected sounds into the recording. Wilco recorded nineteen songs for the double-CD album, and wanted the label to release it with a retail price comparable to a single-CD release. &quot;Being There&quot; was a commercial success, selling 300,000 copies and peaking in the top half of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Reprise records invested $100,000 in the single &quot;Outta Mind (Outtasite)&quot;, but received little radio exposure. While on tour, Tweedy began to spend time reading books by William H. Gass, Henry Miller, and John Fante. As he read their books, Tweedy decided to place more of an emphasis on writing. Representatives in the A&amp;R department of Reprise wanted a radio single from &quot;Summerteeth&quot;, and Wilco reluctantly agreed to a re-working of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot;. The single was a top five hit on adult album alternative radio stations, but failed to cross over to a larger audience.

Before the release of &quot;Summerteeth&quot;, the daughter of the late folk legend Woody Guthrie contacted folk rock singer Billy Bragg, who in turn contacted Tweedy about recording an album of unreleased Woody Guthrie songs. Tweedy was indifferent to the idea of working with Bragg, but Jay Bennett&#x27;s enthusiasm about the idea convinced Tweedy to get the band involved in the project. As a result of Tweedy&#x27;s feelings on the political nature of some of the lyrics, Bragg recorded mostly political songs while Wilco recorded more neutral songs. Almost all of the songs that appeared on &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; and &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot; were recorded over a six-day period in December 1997. The first &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; album and a second Golden Smog album (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;) were released in 1998, &quot;Summerteeth&quot; was released in early 1999, and &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot; was released in 2000. Tweedy received his first Grammy nomination when &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1999.

==== &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; ====

Jeff Tweedy was invited to play at Chicago&#x27;s Noise Pop festival, and was told that he could collaborate with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O&#x27;Rourke based on his fascination with O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s &quot;Bad Timing&quot; album. O&#x27;Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche&#x27;s playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche. Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett&#x27;s focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments between songs about how the album should sound. Tweedy asked O&#x27;Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form. Tweedy also fired Bennett around this time, believing (according to Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Bennett was a collective decision.

Reprise Records&#x27; parent company Time Warner merged with America Online in 2001, and the recording company was asked to cut costs. Howie Klein, the CEO of Reprise Records, considered Wilco to be one of the label&#x27;s core bands, but was offered a lucrative buy-out by AOL Time Warner. Reprise did not consider the album commercially viable and was not interested in releasing the album. David Kahne (Head of A&amp;R) agreed to release Wilco from Reprise under the condition that Wilco got to keep all legal entitlements to the &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; album. After an article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; publicly described these managerial practices, CEO Gary Briggs quit. Shortly after leaving the label, Briggs remarked:

&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; was originally scheduled to be released on Reprise on September 11, 2001, prior to the band&#x27;s departure from Reprise. Seven days later, Tweedy decided that he would stream the entirety of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; on Wilco&#x27;s official website. Over thirty record labels offered to release &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; after the departure from Reprise was official. One of the thirty was Warner Brothers affiliate Nonesuch Records, who signed Wilco in November 2001. AOL Time Warner paid Wilco to make the album on Reprise, gave them the record for free, and then bought it back on the Nonesuch label. The album was released on April 23, 2002 to significant critical acclaim, including being named the best album of the year by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. The album became the biggest hit of Jeff Tweedy&#x27;s career and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 500,000 copies.

==== &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; ====

Scott McCaughey contacted Tweedy about recording an album together for a The Minus 5 release. They scheduled a meeting for September 11, 2001, but were reluctant to enter the recording studio after the terrorist attacks. At night, McCaughey and Tweedy decided to begin recording songs as a way to calm down. A few more tracks were later added to the album with the rest of Wilco, and it was released with the name &quot;Down with Wilco&quot; in 2003.

In November 2003, Wilco began recording a fifth studio album. Unlike their previous albums, all of the songs were originally performed in the studio and then later adapted for playing at concerts. Wilco released &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; on June 22, 2004, and it attained a top ten peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was awarded with Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. A few weeks before the album&#x27;s release, Tweedy released a book of forty-three poems entitled &quot;Adult Head&quot; on Zoo Press. The following year, the band released their first live album, a two-disc set entitled &quot;Kicking Television: Live in Chicago&quot;, recorded at The Vic Theater.

==== Later Wilco albums ====
Wilco recorded twelve tracks for a sixth studio album entitled &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot;, which was released on May 15, 2007. &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest debut yet. It sold over 87,000 copies in its first week of release.

In early May 2009, former Wilco member Jay Bennett sued Tweedy for breach of contract. Bennett died later that month of an apparent accidental overdose of the painkiller fentanyl. In June 2009 Wilco released their seventh studio album &quot;Wilco (The Album)&quot;, followed by &quot;The Whole Love&quot; in 2011, &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 2015, &quot;Schmilco&quot; in 2016, &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; in 2019, &quot;Cruel Country&quot; in May 2022, and &quot;Cousin&quot; in 2023.

=== Other work ===
Jeff Tweedy has performed several solo tours, on which he typically plays acoustic music. He also recorded the song &quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;. On October 24, 2006, Nonesuch Records released &quot;Sunken Treasure: Live in the Pacific Northwest&quot;, a live DVD by Tweedy. The disc includes performances and conversations gathered over five nights on Tweedy&#x27;s February 2006 solo acoustic tour, with footage from concerts at Seattle&#x27;s Moore Theater, Portland&#x27;s Crystal Ballroom, Eugene&#x27;s McDonald Theatre, Arcata&#x27;s Humboldt State University, and The Fillmore in San Francisco. The DVD was directed by Christoph Green and Fugazi&#x27;s Brendan Canty, the creators of the documentary series &quot;Burn to Shine&quot;.

Tweedy has partnered with Mavis Staples on three acclaimed albums. In 2010 they released &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, in 2013, &quot;One True Vine&quot;, and in 2017 &quot;If All I Was Was Black&quot;. Tweedy played an array of instruments on these albums and wrote many of the songs.

Tweedy worked with the psychedelic-influenced garage rock group White Denim on their record &quot;Corsicana Lemonade&quot;, recording some songs at Wilco&#x27;s Chicago studio The Loft. In 2015 the album &quot;Still&quot; by Richard Thompson was released. The album was produced by Tweedy in The Loft Studios and features Tweedy on guitar and backing vocals.

Tweedy has appeared as a fictional singer-songwriter on 2014 episodes of &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; and &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

On June 4, 2014, it was announced that he had formed a new band called Tweedy with his son Spencer. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sukierae&quot; was released on September 16. The release was followed by a world tour in which half of the set consisted of new songs off &quot;Sukierae&quot; performed by a touring band including Spencer. The latter half of the set Tweedy plays solo, typically performing Wilco and Uncle Tupelo classics.

In June 2017 Jeff Tweedy released a solo acoustic album of eleven songs spanning his career from Wilco, Loose Fur, and Golden Smog titled &quot;Together at Last&quot;. In November 2018 Jeff Tweedy released a memoir titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Go (So We Can Get Back)&quot; and his first solo album of new material, titled &quot;Warm&quot;. A companion album to &quot;Warm&quot; titled &quot;Warmer&quot; was released on April 13, 2019, as a Record Store Day exclusive.

In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic Susan Tweedy and her family created a recurring video series on Instagram dubbed &quot;The Tweedy Show&quot; featuring Jeff and their sons performing original and cover songs. During the shelter-in-place Jeff Tweedy also wrote and recorded his third solo album titled &quot;Love Is the King&quot; which was announced to release on October 23, 2020 and wrote his second book titled &quot;How to Write One Song&quot; which was announced to release on October 13, 2020, on the E. P. Dutton publishing label. His third book, &quot;World Within a Song&quot;, will be released in November 2023.

== Musical style ==

Tweedy&#x27;s musical style has varied over his music career. Tweedy&#x27;s vocal style is considered nasal, emotional, and raspy, and has been compared to that of Neil Young. His first exposure to music was through gramophone records that his siblings left behind when they attended college, and he particularly liked The Beatles&#x27; White Album. Tweedy would frequently read issues of magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and began to purchase punk rock albums such as The Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; and X&#x27;s &quot;Wild Gift&quot;. Belleville crowds did not respond well to punk music, so while Tweedy was a member of The Primitives they played covers of country songs at much faster tempos. When Uncle Tupelo formed, the band began composing its own songs influenced by Jason &amp; the Scorchers and The Minutemen. Wilco&#x27;s first album shared many musical similarities with the four previous Uncle Tupelo albums, but on &quot;Being There&quot;, Tweedy began introducing more experimental themes into his music. He claims that he wanted to rebel against the belief spread by the &quot;No Depression&quot; magazine that Wilco was primarily a country band. One of the most influential albums for Tweedy was &quot;Bad Timing&quot; by Jim O&#x27;Rourke, which helped to inspire &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;. Tweedy uses a 1957 Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar, as well as a 1965 Fender Jazzmaster, at least three different Telecasters, an Epiphone Casino, a Rickenbacker 360, and a Gibson SG Standard. He has vintage SGs from &#x27;62 and &#x27;65 as well as a 2007 Custom Shop model and a 2008 Custom Shop Vintage Original Spec (V.O.S.) that are all rigged with Maestro tremolo bars. He also has been known to use a Breedlove 000 and even designed a limited edition 000 for Breedlove in 2007. His amplifier of choice is a Vox AC30.

== Personal life ==
Tweedy has been prone to having migraines throughout his life; he has missed as many as forty days of elementary school in one year with the condition. While he attempted to regulate the use of painkillers, he was never able to stop using them for more than five weeks. He attributes that to a comorbidity with major depressive disorder and severe panic attacks. In 2004, he entered a dual diagnosis rehabilitation clinic in order to receive treatment for an addiction to prescription painkiller Vicodin. Tweedy quit smoking the next year; John Stirratt claimed afterward that significantly improved the focus of the band.

Tweedy is married to former bookkeeper Sue Miller and lives in the Irving Park area of Chicago. He first met Miller when he was trying to get Uncle Tupelo booked at Cubby Bear, where Miller worked. Miller also worked in a club in Chicago named Lounge Ax in 1989, and booked Uncle Tupelo for 16 shows over four years. They began dating in 1991 and were married on August 9, 1995. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. During a 2015 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Tweedy said &quot;she&#x27;s doing great now.&quot; 

Tweedy also said that music is a healthy distraction in such difficult times. They have two sons: Spencer and Sam. Spencer was the drummer for pre-teen rock band The Blisters and a new band called Tully Monster. In 2008, Spencer joined Wilco on stage at Madison Square Garden to play drums on their song &quot;The Late Greats,&quot; while opening for Neil Young. Tweedy has converted to Judaism. His wife is Jewish; their sons both had Bar Mitzvah ceremonies. During the ceremony for his older son, Tweedy played an acoustic version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young&quot;.

In November 2019 Tweedy&#x27;s home in Irving Park was shot at least seven times in an attack described by his son as &quot;not targeted&quot;. No injuries were reported.

<text>Embassy Pictures Corporation (also and later known as Avco Embassy Pictures as well as Embassy Films Associates) was an American independent film production and distribution company, which was active from 1942 to 1986. Embassy was responsible for films such as &quot;The Graduate&quot;, &quot;The Producers&quot;, &quot;The Fog&quot;, &quot;The Howling&quot;, &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, and &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing,&quot; and television series such as &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;.

Embassy was founded in 1942 by Joseph E. Levine as a foreign film distributor, before branching out into film production in 1945.

In 1967, Embassy was acquired by Avco. The company struggled in the 1970s before focusing on lower-budget genre films at the end of the decade. In 1982, television producer Norman Lear and his partner Jerry Perenchio bought the studio, and it became involved in television production. In 1985, Embassy was sold to The Coca-Cola Company, which sold the studio to Dino De Laurentiis in October of that same year. 

Today, StudioCanal owns ancillary rights to the majority of Embassy&#x27;s theatrical library, while Sony Pictures Television owns worldwide television syndication rights to the studio&#x27;s films and TV shows.

==History==
===From founding to success===
The company was founded in 1942 by Joseph E. Levine, initially to distribute foreign films in the United States. The company entered film production in 1945, co-producing with Maxwell Finn the documentary &quot;Gaslight Follies&quot;, a compilation of silent film clips narrated by Ben Grauer.

Embassy found success in 1956 bringing the Japanese film &quot;Godzilla&quot; to the American general public (in a re-edited version), acquiring the rights for $12,000 and spending $400,000 promoting it under the title &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot;, and earning $1 million in theatrical rentals. They then made a $100,000 deal to bring the French-Italian film &quot;Attila&quot; (1954) to the United States in 1958 and spent $600,000 promoting it, which returned $2 million in rentals. Their breakthrough came the following year with &quot;Hercules&quot;, starring Steve Reeves and released by Warner Bros. Levine invested $120,000 on dubbing, sound effects and new titles and spent $1.25 million on promoting the film. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, with rentals of $4.7 million, starting a growth in the sword-and-sandal genre.

===Art house releases===
After releasing the &quot;Hercules&quot; sequel, &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot; (1960), Embassy expanded to add 13 offices nationally as well as offices in Rome, London and Paris and signed deals with Italian production company Titanus and producer Carlo Ponti and began distributing art films, often European ones. In 1961, Embassy bought North American distribution rights for &quot;Two Women&quot; after Levine seeing no more than three minutes of its &quot;rushes&quot;. The film, based on a novella written by Alberto Moravia, had been directed by Vittorio de Sica, and starred Sophia Loren (Ponti&#x27;s wife) and Eleanora Brown, who acted out the respective roles of a mother and her young daughter whom World War II had displaced from their home. Levine&#x27;s promotional campaign focused on one still photograph, which showed Loren, as the mother, wearing a torn dress, kneeling in the dirt, and weeping with rage and grief. Predicting that she would win the Academy Award for her performance, Levine brought Loren to the United States for interviews, bought space for, and placed, large advertisements in newspapers, and saw to it that &quot;Two Women&quot; appeared in the cities of residence of Academy Award jury members.

Levine&#x27;s efforts paid off when the film was a hit and Loren became the first cast member of a foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Actress. Embassy also acquired rights to and distributed &quot;Divorce Italian Style&quot; (1961); &quot;Salvatore Giuliano&quot; (1962); Federico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;8½&quot; (1963), as well as Ponti&#x27;s producing credits including &quot;Boccaccio &#x27;70&quot; (1962), and de Sica&#x27;s &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1963) and &quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot; (1964). Embassy also produced an adaptation of &quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot; (1961), also with Reeves in the lead, and Rick Carrier&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the City&quot; (1962).

On the back of the success of Ingmar Bergman, Embassy released some of his earlier films in the United States, his film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Wanton&quot; (1949) in 1962 and his film &quot;Night Is My Future&quot; (1948) in 1963. Embassy also released two 1961 films produced by Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman - &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; (released in 1962) and &quot;The Hellfire Club&quot; (released in 1963). Other Ponti-produced films released by Embassy include &quot;Landru&quot; (1963), directed by Claude Chabrol; &quot;Contempt&quot; (1963), directed by Jean-Luc Godard; &quot;The Empty Canvas&quot; starring Bette Davis; &quot;The Ape Woman&quot; (1964); &quot;Casanova 70&quot; (1965); &quot;The 10th Victim&quot; (1965); and de Sica&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970).

===Paramount Pictures deal-era===
By the 1960s, Levine had transformed Embassy into a production company. In 1963, Levine was offered a $30 million deal with Paramount Pictures to produce films in the vein of his previous successes. Paramount would finance the films and Embassy would receive part of its profits. Under the deal, Levine produced Harold Robbins&#x27;s &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964) and its prequel &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966), which were successes, along with flops such as &quot;Harlow&quot; (1965), starring Carroll Baker. A third film based on a novel by Harold Robbins was also released as part of three-picture deal with Robbins, &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; (1964).

Embassy also released several films produced by or starring Stanley Baker including &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964), &quot;Dingaka&quot; (1965) and &quot;Robbery&quot; (1967).

Later in the decade, Embassy functioned on its own with many Rankin/Bass Productions animated features, including &quot;The Daydreamer&quot; (1966) and &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot; (1967), and successful live-action productions including &quot;The Graduate&quot;, by second-time film director Mike Nichols, &quot;The Producers&quot;, by first-time director Mel Brooks (both 1967), and &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968), which won an Academy Award for Katharine Hepburn.

===New ownership under Avco===

Embassy enjoyed its greatest success with &quot;The Graduate&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film of the year. This enabled Levine to sell his company to Avco for a deal worth $40 million, although he stayed on as chief executive.

In 1969, Embassy appointed Mike Nichols to the board of directors and acquired his film production company, Friwaftt. Levine also ended a four-year feud with Ponti and Loren and produced Loren&#x27;s first film since she became a mother, &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970).

Levine also started a record label with music industry executives Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, Avco Embassy Records, later shortened to Avco Records. In 1969, the company bought out Mike Nichols&#x27; production company and signed him to make two movies.

The company became less successful in the 1970s and only had hits with Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971) and &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973). In 1972, the company had begun cutting back on production and in 1973 recorded a loss of $8.1 million. Levine resigned as president on May 28, 1974, to re-enter independent production and was replaced by Bill Chaikin. By 1975, Avco Embassy stopped making movies altogether.

In 1968, Avco Embassy launched Avco Embassy Television, to syndicate films from the Avco Embassy library on television. In 1976, Avco Embassy sold their broadcasting division and Avco Program Sales to Multimedia, Inc., becoming Multimedia Entertainment (since folded into what is now NBCUniversal Syndication Studios).

===Robert Rehme years===
In late 1977, Avco Embassy announced its intention to resume production. In 1978, Robert Rehme was appointed president and chief operating officer and he convinced the company to give him $5 million for a production fund.

Under his stewardship, Avco Embassy concentrated on lower budgeted genre films, six of which were successful: &quot;The Manitou&quot; (1978), &quot;Phantasm&quot; (1979), &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981), &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Howling&quot; (1981). They benefited in part from the fact that American International Pictures recently left the exploitation field, lessening competition in this area.

Rehme left the company in 1981, having seen it increase its revenue from $20 million to $90 million.

In 1981, Tom Laughlin offered to buy the company for $24 million but withdrew his offer.

===Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio===
In January 1982, television producer Norman Lear and his partner Jerry Perenchio bought the studio for $25 million, reverted the name to the previous Embassy Pictures by dropping off &quot;Avco&quot;, and renamed T.A.T. Communications Company as Embassy Communications, Inc. and T.A.T. Communications Productions as Embassy Television and its distributor as Embassy Telecommunications. The company was producing such hits as &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; and &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, and by Tandem, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. During this period, they launched &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;. They also expanded into making made-for-TV movies, including &quot;Eleanor, First Lady of the World&quot; (1982) and &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; (1983).

In late 1982, Embassy bought out Andre Blay Corporation and renamed the company as Embassy Home Entertainment; prior releases from its film catalog (as Avco Embassy Picture Corporation) had been handled through Magnetic Video, as well as reissues of the Blay Video catalog. 

In 1984, Embassy Pictures was renamed as Embassy Films Associates. That same year, &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, which it distributed in the United States, received the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. 

During this period, Rob Reiner, who up to that point had been most famous for playing Michael &quot;Meathead&quot; Stivic on &quot;All in the Family&quot;, began his directorial career with two Embassy releases, &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; (1985). His third film, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (1986), started at Embassy, but it almost got cancelled because of the sale to Columbia days before filming was to begin. Norman Lear ended up putting up his own money for completion funds.

===Coca-Cola and others===
Lear and Perenchio sold Embassy Communications (including Tandem Productions) to The Coca-Cola Company for $485 million on June 18, 1985. Coca-Cola, which also owned Columbia Pictures at the time, sold Embassy Pictures to Dino De Laurentiis on November 1, 1985, but kept Embassy&#x27;s television division active. De Laurentiis folded the company into his De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, and the home video division became Nelson Entertainment, run by executives who had previously worked at DEG before it went bankrupt. 

Although De Laurentiis was now owner of Embassy, he was not given rights to then-upcoming films such as &quot;Crimewave&quot; and &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (both 1986), and an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Body&quot;, which became &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), which became properties of Lear and Perenchio. 

By the early 1990s, key rights to the Embassy library transferred from company to company due to the bankruptcies of the companies that separately owned them (De Laurentiis for theatrical, Nelson for home video). Dino De Laurentiis&#x27;s assets went to Parafrance International, in conjunction with Village Roadshow, while Nelson&#x27;s assets were acquired by Crédit Lyonnais Bank and later sold to PolyGram. Nelson&#x27;s parent company, NHI continued to exist well into the mid-1990s. In 1994, Parafrance&#x27;s assets were acquired by the French production company StudioCanal which today owns ancillary rights to the majority of the Embassy theatrical library. However, North American video rights to the majority of Embassy&#x27;s film library are owned by Amazon MGM Studios via its Orion Pictures subsidiary due to them acquiring most of PolyGram&#x27;s pre-March 31, 1996 film library which included the Epic catalog, which in turn incorporated the Nelson catalog, while Sony Pictures Television owns worldwide television syndication rights to the theatrical library as well as full ancillary and distribution rights to the Embassy Television library.

<text>Naumann is a lunar impact crater located on the Oceanus Procellarum in the northwest sector of the Moon. It is a bowl-shaped, symmetrical crater with a relatively high-albedo rim. There are no notable impact craters overlaying the rim edge or the interior. The nearest named craters are Lichtenberg to the southwest and Nielsen to the southeast. Otherwise it is located in a region of lunar mare which is devoid of significant features.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Naumann.

<text>HPI Savage is a line of radio-controlled monster trucks manufactured in Japan by Hobby Products International of Foothill Ranch, California, US.

The overall setup of the Savage, with its massive tires and tall suspension, make it a perfect truck for &quot;bashing&quot;, and also enables the model to be able to withstand tremendous abuse. The Savage is used for &quot;bashing&quot;, which consists of jumps, flips, etc. and it shines in this area.
New for 2016 are the Savage XL Octane V2, Savage XL F5.9 and Savage XL Flux.

Several hobbyists have had success using the Savage for high speed using option tires and gearing. The current RC monster truck world speed record is held by a Savage, at 74 MPH.

==Savage 21==

The original, ready-to-run (RTR) Savage 21 served as the foundation for the many vehicles that came after. It featured a unique boxed chassis with parallel aluminum panels (known as Twin Vertical Plates, TVP) surrounding the transmission and drive axles, two-speed transmission, heavy-duty slipper clutch, eight oil-filled coilover shock absorbers, 4 inches of suspension travel, four-wheel drive, HPI .21ci (3.4 cc) pull-start engine with rear exhaust and an HPI 27 MHz three-channel pistol grip radio. A &quot;reverse module,&quot; sold separately, mounts inside the transmission, where it replaces an idler gear assembly. It utilizes the factory-installed radio&#x27;s non-proportional third channel and an additional servo to add the convenience and fun of reverse when the model is first brought to a complete stop.

==Savage SS==

Shortly after the Savage 21 was released, the Savage SS (Super Sport, meaning kit version) was released. It was an unassembled version of the Savage, based on the Savage 21, but came with some pre-included option parts such as an aluminum tuned pipe and an upgraded S-25 engine. The S-25 engine later became standard in the Savage 25 RTR.
Unlike the RTR versions of the Savage, the SS version was supplied without radio gear based on the assumption that drivers already had advanced radio systems perfect for the Savage SS.

==Savage 25==

The Savage 21 was replaced by the updated Savage 25. This version added both a larger HPI .25ci (4.1 cc) engine, the S-25, for additional power and torque as well as HPI&#x27;s unique &quot;Roto-Start&quot; electric starter system. The Roto-Start kept the weight-saving advantages of the pull start with the extra added convenience of electric starting via an external electric starter. This starter, standard on most new HPI RTR models, incorporates a gear-driven one-way bearing mounted on the engine in lieu of the pull starter. The external starter is a motor-driven gearbox which spins a hexagonal steel shaft and is powered by a standard 7.2-volt nickel cadmium battery pack. A pinned ball joint at the end of the shaft mates with a socket on the rear of the engine-mounted one-way bearing assembly. The system has proven to be a popular one, with third-party engine manufacturers such as O.S. Engines and Team Orion designing their replacement engines to accept the assembly. A limited edition version of the Savage 25 added a three-speed transmission along with updated wheels and tires. These parts can easily be retrofitted to previous versions.

==Savage ATV==

A mechanically identical (save for springs) variation of the Savage 25 replaces that model&#x27;s Lexan pickup truck body with that of a Kawasaki KFX700 all-terrain vehicle (ATV) with articulated rider figure designed to move with the model&#x27;s steering motions.

==Savage 4.6 SS==

When the Savage 25 was released, the Savage 4.6 SS kit was updated to include the more powerful engine, improved differentials and other upgrades. A ready-to-run version, the Savage 25 Limited Edition, added colored shock absorber springs, a 3-speed transmission, and a commemorative bodyshell to differentiate it from the kit version.

== E-Savage==

An electric version, dubbed E-Savage, is a 1/10 scale version similar in design to the original. It is powered by two HPI &quot;GT550&quot; 14.4v electric motors and competes in the market defined by models such as the Traxxas E-Maxx and Kyosho Twin Force. It shares no parts at all with the full size Savage because it is simply a rebadged Hot Bodies E-Zilla.

There is also an E-Savage Sport. The only difference between the E-Savage and the E-Savage Sport is that the Sport does not include the battery packs and charger.

==Savage X==

The next ready-to-run version was the Savage X. It had a new Force Engine-built 25 motor. The Savage X has addressed the criticisms of the original twin chassis design, which were poor radio box access and difficult access to the differentials. The enlarged radio box is now easier to open and the differentials can now be removed from the new &quot;split bulkhead&quot; design by removing only 6 screws. The new chassis plates lower the motor and transmission slightly to improve CG, and it now includes a standard composite roll bar and detachable roll hoop to protect the engine.

==Savage X SS==

A variation on the Savage X, the Savage X SS, has a .28ci (4.6cc) engine that has 10% more displacement than the S-25 Model. The Savage X SS also features a hardened steel spur gear, chromed dog bones and 6 gear spider diffs for enhanced drivetrain durability to cope with the extra power of the .28 engine. With this engine the SS version will easily pull wheel stands and an optional wheelie bar is available for the Savage to prevent it from flipping over backwards under hard acceleration.

==Savage X 4.6==

At the end of summer 2007, HPI released the Savage X 4.6 RTR. This model features the Force Engine-made F4.6 motor. The new F4.6 motor retains the reliability of HPI&#x27;s motors while adding more power, though it is not as powerful as the K4.6. The driveline has been upgraded with new alloy differential cases, reversion to the more reliable 21/25-style slipper clutch, and a dual fiberglass brake disc kit. The clutchbell is now a 17 tooth unit. In 2011, HPI released a newer model of the Savage X 4.6.
With all of this power and durability, the jumping ability of the Savage X 4.6 is unsurpassed by any other monster truck. With a top speed of over 45 MPH, hitting a ramp with something this size must be seen to be believed!

==Savage XL==

Released in April 2008. This Savage includes a new K5.9 (.36) motor with aluminum tuned pipe and a stretched chassis. Several changes have been made to improve on the truck, including stronger diff gears, steel spur gear, uprated driveshafts, thicker chassis, metal geared steering servo, aluminum clutch shoes, 3-speed gearbox as stock, and much more. New wheels and tires and a new body complete the truck, which is RTR and comes with a rechargeable receiver pack and charger.

==Savage Flux HP==

In 2009 HPI released the first electric variant of the Savage monster truck, the Savage Flux HP. The Savage Flux HP offers a simple, easy, plug-and-go alternative to the Nitro versions of the Savage. Unlike the nitro-powered Savage, whose engine requires a break-in procedure
, the only thing needed to get the Savage Flux HP up and running is a pair of battery packs.
The Savage Flux HP is capable of speeds up to 62 mph with the standard brushless motor.

==Savage Flux 2350==

The Savage Flux 2350 is a modified version of the Savage Flux HP. The savage Flux HP could handle up to 6 cells were as the flux 2350 could only handle 4 cells, in effect making it the budget minded model.

==Savage 5T==

The Savage 5T is the largest out of the series. Compared to the XL, the main difference is the further elongated TVPs and accommodating driveshaft which provide enough space for a secondary fuel tank. The elongated TVPs measure at 562mm long, making the chassis long enough for a Baja 5T body to fit with proper body posts. In addition to the longer chassis, the Savage 5T also uses enlarged wheel hexes for use with Baja 5T wheels. Because of the Baja look, some like to call it the &quot;Nitro Baja&quot; even though the body has Savage 5T decals designating the model. Even with these major differences, it&#x27;s still a Savage XL with a K5.9 and the 3-speed Savage X optional transmission.
The 5T was only distributed in Japan and the European market, never officially arriving in the US, and has been since discontinued.

==Savage XS Flux==

The Savage XS Flux is a Brushless Mini version of the Savage. It is a (2/3 Savage Flux) 1/10 scale.
With a top speed of 65+ MPH Savage XS Flux
It uses the Flux VEKTOR 4000 motor and VAPOR Pro ESC
and uses 2S or 3S LiPo packs, standard size.
The XS is also Waterproof.

==Savage XL Octane==

Hobby Products International (HPI) announced that the Savage Octane was to be based on the Savage XL platform and equipped with a 15cc, &quot;petrol&quot;-fueled, 2-stroke engine. 
Availability for purchase was originally announced for 2012, but the release date was pushed into 2013. Then further delayed release of the Savage XL Octane to 2014, claiming it was under further development.

The final release date was spring 2014, With the models shipping a few weeks after the announcement. A few design changes took place including different chassis plates and rollover protection to accommodate the larger motor and cooling needs, as well as a redesigned shell and livery.

<text>Carl Gegenbaur (21 August 1826 – 14 June 1903) was a German anatomist and professor who demonstrated that the field of comparative anatomy offers important evidence supporting of the theory of evolution. As a professor of anatomy at the University of Jena (1855–1873) and at the University of Heidelberg (1873–1903), Carl Gegenbaur was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of organic evolution, having taught and worked, beginning in 1858, with Ernst Haeckel, eight years his junior.

Gegenbaur&#x27;s book &quot;Grundzüge der vergleichenden Anatomie&quot; (1859; English translation &quot;Elements of Comparative Anatomy&quot; by Francis Jeffrey Bell, 1878) became the standard textbook, at the time, of evolutionary morphology, emphasizing that structural similarities among various animals provide clues to their evolutionary history. Gegenbaur noted that the most reliable clue to evolutionary history is homology, the comparison of anatomical parts which have a common evolutionary origin.

Gegenbaur had been a student of Albert von Kölliker, Rudolf Virchow, Heinrich Müller and Franz Leydig (1821–1908).

==Life==
Carl Gegenbaur was born in Würzburg, Bavaria, in 1826, and he entered the University of Würzburg as a student in 1845. After taking his degree in 1851, he spent some time in travelling in Italy and Sicily, before returning to Wurzburg as Privatdozent in 1854. In 1855, he was appointed extraordinary professor of anatomy at the University of Jena, and in 1858, he became the ordinary professor, where after 1865, his former student and fellow-worker Ernst Haeckel was professor of zoology. In 1873, Gegenbaur was appointed to Heidelberg, where he was professor of anatomy and director of the Anatomical Institute until his retirement in 1901.

In 1877 Gegenbaur was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the Linnean Society of London. He was honoured as one of the greatest comparative anatomists of the day, because of his labours and philosophical investigations into the structure and development of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.

Gegenbaur was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896.

He died on 14 June 1903 at Heidelberg.

==Impact==
The work by which Gegenbaur is best known is his &quot;Grundriss der vergleichenden Anatomie&quot; (Leipzig, 1874; 2nd edition, 1878), translated into English by Francis Jeffrey Bell (as &quot;Elements of Comparative Anatomy&quot;, 1878), with additions by E. Ray Lankester. While recognizing the importance of comparative embryology in the study of descent, Gegenbaur laid stress on the higher value of comparative anatomy as the basis of the study of homologies, i.e. of the relations between corresponding parts in different animals, as, for example, the arm of man, with the foreleg of a horse, and with the wing of a fowl. A distinctive piece of work was effected by him in 1871 in supplementing the evidence adduced by Huxley in refutation of the skull-vertebrae theory: the theory of the origin of the skull from expanded vertebrae, which, formulated independently by Goethe and Oken, had been championed by Owen. Huxley demonstrated that the skull is built up of cartilaginous pieces; Gegenbaur showed that in the lowest (gristly) fishes, where hints of the original vertebrae might be most expected, the skull is an unsegmented gristly brain-box, and that in higher forms, the vertebral nature of the skull cannot be maintained, since many of the bones, notably those along the top of the skull, arise in the skin.

In 1858, the physician Ernst Haeckel studied under Gegenbaur at Jena, receiving a doctorate in zoology (after his medical degree), and became a professor at the same institution, the University of Jena. Ernst Haeckel expanded on the ideas of Gegenbaur while advocating the concepts of Charles Darwin.

In 1861, he published &quot;Ueber den Bau und die Entwickelung der Wirbelthier-Eier mit partielleer Dotterbildung&quot; (&quot;Proof that the ovum is unicellular in all vertebrates&quot;, &quot;Arch. Anat. Phys.&quot;, 1861.8: 461–529), a fundamental proof in embryology.

Gegenbaur learned techniques as a student of Albert von Kölliker, Rudolf Virchow, Heinrich Müller and Franz Leydig (1821–1908). Carl Gegenbaur had a strong influence on his environment, with his colleagues Matthias Jakob Schleiden, Emil Huschke, Ernst Haeckel, and Hermann Klaatsch (1863–1916).
Carl Gegenbaur also influenced his students, including: Max Fürbringer, Richard Hertwig, Oskar Hertwig, Emil Rosenberg, Ambrosius Hubrecht, Johan Erik Vesti Boas (1855–1935), Hans Friedrich Gadow, Georg Ruge M. Sagemehl, N. Goronowitsch, H. K. Corning, C. Röse and S. Paulli.

Gegenbaur&#x27;s research program of comparative morphology incorporating ontogeny and phylogeny is still evident in the burgeoning field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).

==Other publications==
Other publications by Carl Gegenbaur include a &quot;Text-book of Human Anatomy&quot; (Leipzig, 1883, new ed. 1903), the &quot;Epiglottis&quot; (1892), and &quot;Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates in relation to the Invertebrates&quot; (Leipzig, 2 volumes, 1898–1901). In 1875, he founded the &quot;Morphologisches Jahrbuch&quot; (&quot;Morphological Yearbook&quot;), which he edited for many years. In 1901 he published a short autobiography under the title &quot;Erlebtes und Erstrebtes&quot; (German &quot;experiencing and striving&quot;).

<text>De Schuur (previously known as Toneelschuur until 1 September 2021) is a theater in Haarlem, Netherlands.

The building has two theaters and two movie theaters. In the latter more alternative movies are shown (no Hollywood blockbusters). The name Filmschuur is often used to indicate the movie theaters.

From 1998 to 2003 the current building of the theater at the Lange Begijnestraat 9 was renovated as part of the Appelaar plan. The new design of the building was made by Joost Swarte, a Dutch cartoonist, in 1996. It was the first time in the Netherlands that a building was designed by a cartoonist. Joost Swarte was assisted by Mecanoo, an architecture bureau.

Before 2003 the theater was located at Smedestraat 23.

Frans Lommerse was the manager of the Schuur until 2018. He was succeeded by Marelie van Rongen.

<text>Nicholson is a lunar impact crater located at the western limb. In this position it is subject to libration, which can limit observation. The crater is also viewed at a very oblique angle, so it is seen from the side when observed from the Earth. It is an irregular, somewhat pear-shaped formation that has an uneven rim due to its location amidst rugged ground. The rim is sharp-edged and the inner wall varies in thickness, being narrower along the northern side and wider at the southern end. The interior floor is rough, small and uneven, with no impacts of significance. There is a small central ridge.

Nicholson is located in the Montes Rook, a ring-shaped mountain formation that encircles the immense Mare Orientale feature. It lies to the northwest of Pettit.

<text>Franz Ernst Neumann (11 September 1798 – 23 May 1895) was a German mineralogist and physicist. He devised the first formulas to calculate inductance. He also formulated Neumann&#x27;s law for molecular heat. In electromagnetism, he is credited for introducing the magnetic vector potential.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Franz Ernst Neumann was born in Joachimsthal, Margraviate of Brandenburg (near Berlin), the son of Ernst Neumann, a farmer who became a state agent. His mother was a Countess who was not allowed to marry Ernst, and Neumann did not meet her mother until he was 10 years old.

Neumann attended a Gymnasium in Berlin, where he excelled in mathematics. However his studies were interrupted by the war with France. In 1815 he paused his education at Berlin to serve as a volunteer in the Hundred Days against Napoleon, and was wounded in the Battle of Ligny.

He later returned to finish his studies in Berlin. Subsequently, he enrolled at Berlin University in 1818 as a student of theology, but soon turned to scientific subjects.

=== Professional career ===
Neumann&#x27;s early work was primarily centered around crystallography. His researched gained him recognition, leading to his appointment as Privatdozent at the University of Königsberg. In 1828 he became extraordinary, and in 1829 ordinary, professor of mineralogy and physics. His 1831 study on the specific heats of compounds included what is now known as Neumann&#x27;s law: the molecular heat of a compound is equal to the sum of the atomic heats of its constituents.

Devoting himself next to optics, he produced memoirs which earned him a high place among early searchers of a true dynamical theory of light. In 1832, by the aid of a particular hypothesis as to the constitution of the ether, he reached by a rigorous dynamical calculation results agreeing with those obtained by Augustin Louis Cauchy, and succeeded in deducing laws of double refraction closely resembling those of Augustin-Jean Fresnel. In studying double refraction, with his deduction of the elastic constants (on which the optical properties depend) Neumann employed the assumption that the symmetry of the elastic behavior of a crystal was equal to that of its form. In other words, he assumed that the magnitudes of the components of a physical property in symmetric positions are equivalent. This assumption substantially reduced the number of independent constants and greatly simplified the elastic equations. However, four decades passed before Neumann elaborated his application of symmetry in a course on elasticity in 1873. This principle was later formalized by his student Woldemar Voigt (1850–1918) in 1885: &quot;the symmetry of the physical phenomenon is at least as high as the crystallographic symmetry&quot;, which became a fundamental postulate of crystal physics known as Neumann’s principle. In 1900, Voigt attributed this principle to Neumann&#x27;s 1832 paper even though, at most, all that was present in that work was an implicit assumption that the symmetry of the phenomenon was equal to that of the crystal. Bernhard Minnigerode (1837–1896), another student of Neumann, first expressed this relation in written form in 1887 in the journal &quot;Neues Jahrb. Mineral Geol. Paleontol&quot;. (Vol. 5, p. 145).

In 1845, Neumann introduced the magnetic vector potential to discuss Ampère&#x27;s circuital law.

Later, Neumann attacked the problem of giving mathematical expression to the conditions holding for a surface separating two crystalline media, and worked out from theory the laws of double refraction in strained crystalline bodies. He also made important contributions to the mathematical theory of electrodynamics, and in papers published in 1845 and 1847 established mathematically the laws of the induction of electric currents. His last publication, which appeared in 1878, was on spherical harmonics (&quot;Beiträge zur Theorie der Kugelfunctionen&quot;).

With the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi, he founded in 1834 the &quot;Mathematisch-physikalisches Seminar&quot; which operated in two sections for mathematics and for mathematical physics. Not every student took both sections. In his section on mathematical physics Neumann taught mathematical methods as well as the techniques of an exact experimental physics grounded in the type of precision measurement perfected by his astronomer colleague Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel. The objective of his seminar exercises was to perfect one&#x27;s ability to practice an exact experimental physics through the control of both constant and random experimental errors. Only a few students actually produced original research in the seminar; a notable exception was Gustav Robert Kirchhoff who formulated Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws on the basis of his seminar research. This seminar was the model for many others of the same type established after 1834, including Kirchhoff&#x27;s own at Heidelberg University.

Neumann retired from his professorship in 1876, and died at Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) in 1895 at the age of 96.

== Children ==
Neumann had four children with his wife Luise Florentine Hagen (born 1800): Carl Gottfried Neumann (1832–1925), Franz Ernst Christian Neumann (1834–1818), (1835-1910), and Luise Neumann (1837-1934). His son Carl, became a mathematician and physicist; his younger son, Ernst became professor of medicine in Königsberg.

<doc id="940557" wikidata="Q1470575" url="?curid=940557" title="Jack Brooks (American politician)">
<text>Jack Bascom Brooks (December 18, 1922 – December 4, 2012) was an American Democratic Party politician from the state of Texas who served 42 years in the United States House of Representatives, initially representing from 1953 through 1967, and then, after district boundaries were redrawn in 1966, the from 1967 to 1995. He had strong political ties to other prominent Texas Democrats, including Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn and President Lyndon B. Johnson. For over fifteen years, he was the dean of the Texas congressional delegation.

==Early life==

Brooks was born in Crowley, Louisiana, on December 18, 1922, and moved to Beaumont, Texas, at age5 with his family. When he was 13 his father, a rice salesman, died and among the jobs young Brooks took on were as a carhop and a newspaper reporter. He enrolled at Lamar Junior College in 1939 after receiving a scholarship. After completing his two years at Lamar, he transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, from which he earned a Bachelor of Arts in journalism in 1943.

==Military service==

Brooks enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. He served for about two years on the Pacific islands of Guadalcanal, Guam, and Okinawa, and in North China, attaining the rank of first lieutenant. Afterward, he remained active in the Marine Corps Reserve, retiring in 1972 with the rank of colonel.

==Political career==
===Texas legislature===

A lifelong Democrat, Brooks was elected in 1946 to represent Jefferson County in the Texas House of Representatives. After his election, he sponsored a bill that would turn Lamar Junior College into a four-year university. The bill initially failed, but passed the following year. The institution is today known as Lamar University.

Brooks won re-election to the state legislature in 1948 without opposition; the following year he earned a law degree from the University of Texas Law School.

===U.S. Congress===

After four years in the Texas legislature, Brooks won a crowded 12-candidate Democratic primary and then was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1952 election.

A protégé of fellow Texans, House Speaker Sam Rayburn and then-U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, Brooks showed himself to be a conservative on some issues like the death penalty and gun control, but more liberal on issues like domestic spending, labor, and civil rights. In 1956, he refused to sign the Southern Manifesto that opposed racial integration in public places. Brooks voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, he helped to write the 1964 and 1965 bills.

On November 22, 1963, Brooks was in President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade in Dallas at the time Kennedy was assassinated. Hours later, he was present on Air Force One when Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president.

The 2nd was redistricted as the in 1966, after the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; that congressional district populations had to be equal or close to equal in population.

One of Brooks&#x27;s signature bills required competitive bidding for federal computing contracts. Initially conceived in the mid-1960s and enacted into law in 1972, the Brooks Act was the primary rule for all federal computer acquisitions for three decades, and is often cited as being a catalyst for technological advances.

As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Brooks participated in the 1973–74 impeachment process against Richard Nixon. In mid-July 1974 he drafted and distributed to all members of the committee a strongly-worded set of articles of impeachment. Uncompromising though they were, the Brooks proposals provided others on the committee with an opportunity to meld their thoughts together and to further develop, thus serving as the foundation for the articles of impeachment that the committee subsequently adopted. Because of the part he played in the president&#x27;s downfall, Nixon later called Brooks his &quot;executioner&quot;.

Brooks was one of eight representatives to vote in favor of all five articles of impeachment against Nixon, brought before the Judiciary Committee. The others were also all Democrats: Robert Kastenmeier, Don Edwards, John Conyers, Barbara Jordan, Charles Rangel, Elizabeth Holtzman and Edward Mezvinsky.
Brooks was chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Government Operations from 1975 through 1988, and of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary from 1989 until 1995. He also served on the Select Committee on Congressional Operations, the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations, and the Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security. In 1979, he became the senior member of the Texas congressional delegation, a position which he maintained for fifteen years.

As the leader of the Government Operations Committee, Brooks oversaw legislation affecting budget and accounting matters, and the establishment of departments and agencies. He also helped pass the Inspector General Act of 1978, the General Accounting Office Act of 1980, the Paper Reduction Act of 1980, and the Single Audit Act of 1984.

In 1988, Brooks&#x27;s influence was made prominent by his unusual involvement in trade policy. He introduced a spending bill amendment that banned Japanese companies from U.S. public works projects for one year. He said he was motivated by continuing signs that the Japanese government &quot;intended to blatantly discriminate against U.S. firms in awarding public works contracts&quot;. House Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington, who opposed the amendment, said Brooks &quot;is one of the most powerful and effective chairmen in Congress.&quot;

Brooks served twice as a House impeachment manager, being among the House impeachment managers that successfully prosecuted the cases against federal judges Alcee Hastings and Walter Nixon in their 1989 impeachment trials.

While chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Brooks sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1991, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. He was also a sponsor of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a measure which eventually came to include a ban on assault weapons (the inclusion of which he opposed).

Brooks won re-election in the 1992 election, comfortably defeating his Republican opponent Steve Stockman. However, two years later, in 1994, the 21-term incumbent unexpectedly lost to Stockman, becoming the most senior representative ever to be unseated in a general election, a distinction Brooks still holds as of . His tenure had extended across the administrations of 10 U.S. presidents, and he was on the verge of becoming the dean of the U.S. House had he won a 22nd term.

==Personal life and death==

In 1960, Brooks married Charlotte Collins. They had three children: Jeb, Kate, and Kimberly.

Brooks died at Baptist Hospital in Beaumont on December 4, 2012, at age 89.

<text>Monsoon Wedding is a 2001 comedy-drama film directed by Mira Nair, written by Sabrina Dhawan, and starring Naseeruddin Shah, Lillete Dubey, Shefali Shah and Vasundhara Das. The story depicts romantic entanglements during a traditional Punjabi Hindu wedding in Delhi. Dhawan wrote the first draft of the screenplay in a week while in Columbia University&#x27;s MFA film program. Although set entirely in New Delhi, it was internationally co-produced between companies in India, the United States, Italy, France and Germany.

&quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot; premiered in the Marché du Film section of the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and went on to win the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival and receive a Golden Globe Award nomination while grossing over $30 million internationally at the box office. A musical based on the film premiered on Broadway in April 2014. In 2017, IndieWire named it the 19th best romance of the 21st century.

==Plot==
The film&#x27;s central story deals with the organisation of an enormous, chaotic, and expensive wedding that is due to take place in a modern Indian family. Lalit Verma (Naseeruddin Shah) and his wife Pimmi (Lillete Dubey) have arranged a marriage for their daughter Aditi (Vasundhara Das) to Hemant Rai (Parvin Dabas). Hemant is the son of a family friend who lives in Texas, and Aditi has only known him for a few weeks. As so often happens in Indian culture, such a wedding means that, for one of the few times in each generation, the extended family comes together from all corners of the globe, bringing its emotional baggage along.

Lalit and Pimmi are helped with the main planning by Pimmi&#x27;s sister Shashi and her husband C.L (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who have arrived earlier from Oman. A few days before the engagement, Tej Puri (Rajat Kapoor), Lalit&#x27;s extremely wealthy brother-in-law, arrives from the U.S.. Tej is married to Lalit&#x27;s sister and has helped the Verma family regain their financial footing after the Partition of India left them penniless many years ago. Tej offers to pay for Aditi&#x27;s cousin, Ria Verma (Shefali Shah) to attend university in the U.S., after the family consults him for advice. Ria and her mother live with the Verma family, who took them in after the death of Ria&#x27;s father. Despite his generous offer, Ria stays away from Tej and is not comfortable in his presence.

Lalit begins experiencing difficulty in paying for the final, smaller aspects of the wedding and is embarrassed when he has to borrow money from friends and colleagues. Meanwhile, P.K. Dubey (Vijay Raaz), the eccentric wedding planner, falls in love with Alice (Tillotama Shome), the Vermas&#x27; maid. Ria grows concerned after she witnesses what appears to be Tej grooming a younger relative, ten-year-old Aliya. Aditi&#x27;s younger brother Varun (Ishan Nair) plans an elaborate dance for the pre-wedding party with another cousin, Ayesha (Neha Dubey), but Lalit worries that his son is becoming too effeminate and plans to send him to boarding school. Meanwhile, Ayesha is mutually attracted to Pimmi&#x27;s Australian nephew Rahul (Randeep Hooda), a fact they attempt to hide from the family. Dubey&#x27;s workers see Alice trying on Aditi&#x27;s wedding jewellery, and the men accuse her of stealing. The incident causes her to become withdrawn from Dubey and he grows depressed.

A few days before the wedding, Aditi sleeps with an old lover, her married boss Vikram; and confesses this to Hemant. The incident only serves as a reminder to Aditi as to why she stopped seeing Vikram. Though he is initially angry, Hemant is glad for her honesty and is confident that they can put it behind them and be happy together. The workers apologise to Alice and she reconciles with Dubey. The night before the ceremony, Varun refuses to dance due to the comments made by his father, and Ayesha performs with the help of Rahul. Aditi and Hemant grow closer and they share a few intimate moments, which re-affirms their faith in the marriage. After a night of jokes, drama and dances, Ria catches Tej trying to take Aliya for a drive alone. Ria stops them from driving off and takes Aliya away from him, revealing to Lalit and others that Tej had molested her as a child. Lalit&#x27;s sister does not believe her, attributing her accusations to her character and unmarried status. Emotionally distraught, Ria leaves.

The next day, Lalit pleads with Ria to return to the wedding, admitting that he can&#x27;t possibly imagine what she has gone through but also saying that he can&#x27;t disown Tej, since they are family. Ria is not happy but agrees to return for the sake of Aditi. Hours before the wedding, however, Lalit changes his mind and tells his sister and Tej to leave the wedding and the family home. Tej&#x27;s wife insists that Ria&#x27;s accusation was a small matter but Lalit stands his ground.

The Monsoon rains begin as Aditi and Hemant are married in an elaborate wedding, while Dubey and Alice simultaneously wed in a simple ceremony, and later celebrate with the Vermas. Ria moves on from her past life, and is finally able to freely enjoy the festivities.

==Reception==
&quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot; received positive reviews from critics on release. Roger Ebert rated the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and called it “one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature.” Sandi Chaitram of BBC gave a positive review and wrote “she (Mira) successfully creates the opportunity for tense drama, which does not stifle the overall feelgood nature of the film, or impede the finale&#x27;s (somewhat cheesy) confirmation of family love.” 

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack includes a qawwali by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, a ghazal by Farida Khanum, a Punjabi song by Sukhwinder Singh, an old Indian song by Rafi, a folk dance song.
The film includes an Urdu ghazal, &quot;Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo (Don&#x27;t Be So Stubborn About Leaving Today)&quot; sung by Pakistani artist Farida Khanum.
The song &quot;Aaj Mera Ji Karda&quot; is recreated by Indian musicians Tanishk Bagchi and Arjunna Harjaie for the film Lucknow Central starring Farhan Akhtar.

<doc id="940568" wikidata="Q5738168" url="?curid=940568" title="Heremod">
<text>Heremod (Proto-Norse: *&quot;Harimōdaz&quot; , Latin form: Heremodius) is a legendary Danish king and a legendary king of the Angles who would have lived in the 2nd century and known through a short account of his exile in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; and from appearances in some genealogies as the father of Scyld. He may be the same as one of the personages named Hermóðr in Old Norse sources. Heremod may also be identical to Lother (Latin Lotherus) in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 1) or the same history may have been applied to two originally separate figures.

==From Beowulf==
In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, after Beowulf has defeated Grendel, a bard sings the deeds of Sigmund:

He had of all heroes the highest renown&lt;br&gt;
among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,&lt;br&gt;
for deeds of daring that decked his name&lt;br&gt;
since the hand and heart of Heremod&lt;br&gt;
grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished&lt;br&gt;
to join with Jutes at mercy of foes,&lt;br&gt;
to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow&lt;br&gt;
had lamed him too long; a load of care&lt;br&gt;
to earls and athelings all he proved.&lt;br&gt;
Oft indeed, in earlier days,&lt;br&gt;
for the warrior&#x27;s wayfaring wise men mourned,&lt;br&gt;
who had hoped of him help from harm and bale,&lt;br&gt;
and had thought their sovran&#x27;s son would thrive,&lt;br&gt;
follow his father, his folk protect,&lt;br&gt;
the hoard and the stronghold, heroes&#x27; land,&lt;br&gt;
home of Scyldings (Denmark).

It appears that Heremod was banished by his subjects and fled to the Jutes where he was betrayed to his death.
After Beowulf has slain Grendel&#x27;s dam, King Hrothgar speaks again of Heremod:

                    Was not Heremod thus&lt;br&gt;
to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,&lt;br&gt;
nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter,&lt;br&gt;
for doom of death to the Danishmen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,&lt;br&gt;
companions at board! So he passed alone,&lt;br&gt;
chieftain haughty, from human cheer.&lt;br&gt;
Though him the Maker with might endowed,&lt;br&gt;
delights of power, and uplifted high&lt;br&gt;
above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,&lt;br&gt;
his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he&lt;br&gt;
to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless&lt;br&gt;
strain of struggle and stress of woe,&lt;br&gt;
long feud with his folk.
==In genealogies==

In genealogies Heremod appears as son of Itermon son of Hratha son of Hwala or Gwala. Heremod is also the father of Scyld in most of these genealogies. See Sceafa for a fuller treatment.

- Note: Sceafa is not Scyld, but is Seskef/Cespeth/Scef. Scelda/Skjöld/Scyld is a descendant of Sceafa, as noted all lineages referenced on the Sceafa wiki.

The Beowulf poet may have followed the same tradition, knowing a tale in which in the driving out of Heremod, Heremod&#x27;s young son and heir Scyld somehow ended up placed in a ship which was set adrift.

==From Annales Ryenses and Gesta Danorum==
In the Annales Ryenses and Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; Gesta Danorum (Book 1) Skjöld, that is Scyld, is preceded by a king named Lother, not one name Heremod. But what we are told of Lother fits closely with what the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet says of Heremod. Saxo relates that King Dan left two sons behind, Humbli and Lother. Then:
Humbli was elected king at his father&#x27;s death, thus winning a novel favour from his country; but by the malice of ensuing fate he fell from a king into a common man. For he was taken by Lother in war, and bought his life by yielding up his crown; such, in truth, were the only terms of escape offered him in his defeat. Forced, therefore, by the injustice of a brother to lay down his sovereignty, he furnished the lesson to mankind, that there is less safety, though more pomp, in the palace than in the cottage. Also, he bore his wrong so meekly that he seemed to rejoice at his loss of title as though it were a blessing; and I think he had a shrewd sense of the quality of a king&#x27;s estate. But Lother played the king as insupportably as he had played the soldier, inaugurating his reign straightway with arrogance and crime; for he counted it uprightness to strip all the most eminent of life or goods, and to clear his country of its loyal citizens, thinking all his equals in birth his rivals for the crown. He was soon chastised for his wickedness; for he met his end in an insurrection of his country; which had once bestowed on him his kingdom, and now bereft him of his life.
Saxo then turns to Lother&#x27;s son Skjöld.

That Lother seems in this account to have been killed immediately may be compression of a longer narrative. J. R. R. Tolkien in his &quot;Finn and Hengest&quot; (p. 58) provides a variant version found in the &quot;Scondia Illustrata&quot; by Johannes Messenius (Stockholm, 1700) which likely relies on lost sources rather than on Messenius&#x27; poor memory. Tolkien translates from Messenius&#x27; Latin:
... therefore Lotherus, King of the Danes, bereft of his wealth because of his &quot;excessive tyranny&quot;, and defeated, &quot;fled into Jutia&quot;.

==From Tolkien==
Tolkien points out that &quot;Beowulf&quot; was unknown at the time and so could not have influenced Messenius to imagine Lotherus fleeing to Jutland. The story then becomes quite strange. The king placed on the Danish throne in place of Lotherus is Baldr. Lotherus returns from exile, kills Baldr and then is himself killed by Odin. It looks as though Lother has been confused with Höðr.

Lother might also be identical with the puzzling god Lóðurr. Commentators sometimes suggest Lóðurr is identical to Loki, and of course in the Icelandic texts that have come down to us it is Loki who is Baldr&#x27;s real slayer, with Höðr/Hother being only a tool in Loki&#x27;s plot.

<doc id="940571" wikidata="Q307165" url="?curid=940571" title="Globe (band)">
<text>was a dance-oriented Japanese pop band, formed in 1995 by the producer and songwriter Tetsuya Komuro. Originally consisting of Komuro, Keiko Yamada and Marc Panther, the group&#x27;s singles consistently entered the charts. In late 2002, Yoshiki, the drummer and pianist of X Japan, joined the group, but he left the band about a year later.

Their self-titled 1996 debut album sold over four million copies and their 1998 single ,&quot;Wanna Be a Dreammaker&quot;, won the grand prix award at the 40th Japan Record Awards, the Japanese record industry&#x27;s highest honor. Komuro said that there would be some collaboration work with other artists with the artist title of &quot;Globe Featuring&quot;, and &quot;Globe Extreme&quot; for collaborations with Yoshiki.

==Background==
===1994–1998: Origins and early success===
In the climb of his fame, producer Komuro organized one of his castings, searching for new singers in 1994 (especially one that was called Eurogroove Night). The young girl Keiko Yamada assisted, encouraged by her friends, and her voice undoubtedly attracted Komuro&#x27;s attention instantly. He chose her initially for a solo career. Another one of the careers that TK was thinking about producing at that time was that of the model and MTV VJ Marc Panther, who knew English and French as well as from Japanese. Komuro finally had the idea to make a band using Yamada and Panther as main vocalists and himself as keyboard player and also some vocals.

The band signed with the Avex label in 1995, creating its own sub-label called &quot;Avex Globe&quot;. In August 1995, the first single, &quot;Feel Like Dance&quot;, was released.The fourth single, &quot;Departures&quot;, released in 1996, sold more than 2 million copies. The band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Globe&quot;, also released in 1996, managed to sell more than 4 million copies according to Oricon. It was the best selling album of the year. After having obtained such sales in only two years of work, with more than 12 million singles sold (only in Japan) and 13 million copies of albums, the band was established as a leading pop band in Japan.

The band released a second studio album, &quot;Faces Places&quot;, on March 12, 1997. To promote it, the band began their its large scale tour called &quot;Globe@4Domes&quot; in which they performed at the four biggest Japanese domes: Osaka, Fukuoka, Nagoya and Tokyo. A few months later, the band began its first overseas tour around Asia with Namie Amuro and TRF, also from the Komuro stable. In 1998, they released four singles in about one month in a project called the &quot;Brand New Globe 4 Singles&quot;. One of them, &quot;Wanna Be a Dreammaker&quot;, won the grand prix award at the Japan Record Award.

===1999–2002: experimentation and declining sales===
After a regular period of singles and albums, including a hit &quot;best-of&quot; compilation, &quot;Cruise Record 1995-2000&quot; (#1 at Oricon), the band started to experiment with its music, exploring new musical areas. The first big step in this new era was the &quot;Globe Featuring&quot; project in 2000, in which each member of the band released one single as a solo artist. The most successful of the three singles was Yamada&#x27;s &quot;On the Way to You&quot;, and she went on her first solo nationwide tour of Japan because of the success.

As new music influences were being received in Japan, electronic music like trance became one of the main styles that Globe decided to try. However, this new style was not so well received by Globe&#x27;s fans. Their fourth studio album, &quot;Outernet&quot;, sold poorly compared to previous works. Globe went from selling millions of copies of an album to selling a mere 100 thousand. Komuro, though, was not willing to give up his new style of music for the pop tunes that made Globe so popular in the early 1990s.

In 2002, Globe was even more into the trance style, releasing two studio albums that year: &quot;Lights&quot; and &quot;Lights2&quot;. In July 2002, Globe and the Belgian DJ Push collaborated on the single &quot;Dreams From Above&quot; for the set of Avex&#x27;s Cyber Trance series. On September 1, Yoshiki, the former drummer and pianist of X Japan, joined Globe as its fourth member. Meanwhile, the band was appearing in A-Nation, and the news of the change quickly spread throughout Asia and the world. On November 22, it was announced that Komuro and Yamada were marrying. The ceremony was televised live, causing considerable controversy. The new era of the band, known as &quot;Globe Extreme&quot; (now with Yoshiki), began some weeks later, with the single &quot;Seize the Light&quot;, a song created by Yoshiki and produced by Komuro. A second &quot;best of&quot; album was also released to commemorate the first eight years of Globe&#x27;s musical career, entitled &quot;8 Years: Many Classic Moments&quot; (#2 at Oricon).

===2003–2006: hiatus, solo interests and new style===
After the release of a new album called &quot;Level 4&quot; and &quot;Get It On feat. Keiko&quot; (the only works with Yoshiki), the band went on a two-year break and its members pursued solo interests. Yamada was the first one to go solo, releasing her first single &quot;KCO&quot; in December 2003. In 2004, Panther started his solo project under the pseudonym of 245, a project that has plans for international projection beyond Japan. Later it was announced that the &quot;Globe Extreme&quot; era had ended and that Yoshiki was leaving the band. The band went back to having three members: TK, Yamada and Panther. Yoshiki&#x27;s departure from the group was not completely clarified, but apparently the musician had other work-related commitments. The only release from Globe during 2004 was their complete singles collection, &quot;Globe Decade: Single History 1995-2004&quot;, which included all of the band&#x27;s singles from &quot;Feel Like Dance&quot; to &quot;Get It On feat. Keiko&quot; (a limited edition deluxe box contained every single, album and DVD ever released by the band).

In 2005, after the two-year hiatus, Globe returned to the musical scene with a new single called &quot;Here I Am&quot; (used as the opening theme of the &quot;Black Jack&quot; anime), and in August of that year released their ninth studio album &quot;Globe2 Pop/Rock&quot; to commemorate their 11th anniversary. This album was supposed to be a continuation of the band&#x27;s first album; the hard electronic music was replaced by pop and rock influences. They also released their first online single through iTunes Japan called &quot;Judgement&quot;.

In 2006, it was announced that Globe was about to release its 31st single, &quot;Soldier&quot;, on March 1. Later, the release was cancelled, and as its replacement the band released a new studio album on March 23, entitled &quot;Maniac&quot;. The album did not have any single or music video promoting it. Only &quot;Soldier&quot; was used in advertisements, using a few incomplete scenes from the shooting of the video in TV spots because the full music video was never finished. A few months later, the band went to Latin America to record new material for a first mini-album, &quot;New Deal&quot;, released on August 9, 2006. Latin American musical influences were the main theme of the mini-album, in which Spanish-language phrases were added to songs for the first time.

&quot;New Deal&quot; was the band&#x27;s final album.

===2007–2008: TK&#x27;s legal controversy and presumed hiatus===
Although the band had not released anything since 2006&#x27;s mini-album &quot;New Deal&quot;, no official announcement was made by TK that it had disbanded. Two new singles were originally set to be released in 2008, covers of TM Network&#x27;s songs &quot;Get Wild&quot; and &quot;Self Control&quot;, but these were cancelled by Avex because of Komuro&#x27;s fraud controversy. All of their music was removed from digital downloads, such as iTunes, in both Japan and the US.

===2009–2016: Return from hiatus===
On August 30, 2009, Globe officially announced its return at the A-nation music festival. TK appeared first, speaking about the return and the end of the legal issues. He played several of his greatest hits, both by Globe and songs he wrote for other artists, on piano. Yamada and Panther then joined him and they sang &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;Many Classic Moments&quot;. Their music returned to iTunes in Japan and the US around this date.

On October 24, 2011, Yamada was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. She subsequently underwent a five-hour operation to repair the condition.

===2017–2018: possible return and eventual disbandment===
On June 28, 2017, Globe returned without Yamada and appeared during a televised show to perform with the singer Hiroko Shimabukuro of Speed. They performed the singles &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;Precious Memories&quot;.

On August 15, Komuro posted on his &quot;Instagram&quot; a video in which Yamada can be heard interpreting an unpublished song, &quot;Keiko 2016–2017&quot;.

TK wrote a comment -&quot;After she got sick, I made a song for her to try to sing. It&#x27;s Keiko&#x27;s voice. I think she&#x27;s getting better now&quot; -which implied the entire Globe line-up was in the works of a reunion.

In January 2018, it was reported that Komuro had been having an affair with Yamada nurse while she was in recovery. Shortly after this was reported, Komuro announced his retirement from the music industry, thus essentially putting an end to Globe, among his other projects. Since then, Komuro has returned to the music industry, and there were also reports of divorce settlement talks with Yamada. In February 2021, their divorce was finalized, and the future of Globe is even more uncertain than ever. Both sides express the hope and possibility that despite their divorce, they could still work together in Globe in the future.

<doc id="940578" wikidata="Q332813" url="?curid=940578" title="James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn">
<text>James Albert Edward Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn (30 November 1869 – 12 September 1953), styled Marquess of Hamilton between 1885 and 1913, was a British peer and Unionist politician. He was the first Governor of Northern Ireland, a post he held between 1922 and 1945.
==Background and education==
Born in Hamilton Place, Piccadilly, London, on 30 November 1869, he was the eldest son of the 2nd Duke of Abercorn and godson of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. His mother, Lady Mary Anna, was the fourth daughter of the 1st Earl Howe. He was educated at Eton and subsequently served first in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers until 1892 when he joined the 1st Life Guards. Hamilton was later transferred as major to the North Irish Horse.

In early 1901, he accompanied his father on a special diplomatic mission to announce the accession of King Edward to the governments of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Russia, Germany, and Saxony.

==Political career==
In the 1900 general election, Lord Hamilton stood successfully as Unionist candidate for Londonderry City, and three years later he became Treasurer of the Household, a post he held until the fall of Balfour&#x27;s Conservative administration in 1905. After serving for a time as an Opposition whip, Hamilton succeeded his father as third Duke of Abercorn in 1913. From the 1890s until the partition of Ireland he was a prominent figure in the Unionist campaign to resist Home Rule in Ireland. In 1922 he was appointed governor of the newly created Northern Ireland. He also served as Lord Lieutenant of Tyrone from 1917 until his death, having previously been a Deputy Lieutenant for County Donegal. Abercorn was a popular Royal representative amongst the Unionist population in Northern Ireland, and was reappointed to the post in 1928 after completing his first term of office. In 1931, he declined the offer of the governor generalship of Canada, and three years later he was again reappointed governor for a third term. He remained in this capacity until his resignation in July 1945.

Abercorn was made the last non-royal Knight of the Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick in 1922, and six years later became a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. In the latter year, he was also the recipient of an honorary degree from the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, and received the Royal Victorian Chain in 1945, the same year he was sworn of the Privy Council.

==Family and children==
Abercorn married Lady Rosalind Cecilia Caroline Bingham (1869–1958), only daughter of the 4th Earl of Lucan and Lady Cecilia Catherine Gordon-Lennox (1838–1910); daughter of the 5th Duke of Richmond, at St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, on 1 November 1894. They had five children:
* Lady Mary Cecilia Rhodesia Hamilton (1896–1984), who married twice, firstly in 1917 Capt/Maj. Robert Orlando Rodolph Kenyon-Slaney (1892–1965), with whom she divorced in 1930, and, secondly, in 1930 to Sir John Gilmour, 2nd Baronet. With her first husband, she had three children, and with her second husband one son.
* Lady Cynthia Elinor Beatrix Hamilton (16 August 1897 – 4 December 1972), who married in 1919 Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer (1892–1975). They had three children. By their son, they became grandparents of Diana, Princess of Wales.
* Lady Katherine Hamilton (1900–1985), who married in 1930 Lt.-Col. Sir Reginald Henry Seymour (1878–1938), a descendant of the 1st Marquess of Hertford.
* James Edward Hamilton, 4th Duke of Abercorn (1904–1979)
* Lord Claud David Hamilton (1907–1968), who worked as a barrister in the Inner Temple, and who, in 1946, married Genesta Mary Heath. He was her third husband; they had no children.

Abercorn died at his London home on 12 September 1953, and was buried at Baronscourt in County Tyrone.

<text>Sir Edward Frankland, (18 January 18259 August 1899) was an English chemist. He was one of the originators of organometallic chemistry and introduced the concept of combining power or valence. An expert in water quality and analysis, he was a member of the second royal commission on the pollution of rivers, and studied London&#x27;s water quality for decades. He also studied luminous flames and the effects of atmospheric pressure on dense ignited gas, and was one of the discoverers of helium.

== Biography ==

Edward Frankland was born in Catterall, Lancashire and baptised at Churchtown, Lancashire on 20 February 1825. As his baptismal record shows, his birth was illegitimate. His natural father was Edward Chaddock Gorst, the father of John Eldon Gorst. His mother, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Frankland, later married William Helm, a Lancaster cabinet-maker. &quot;His illegitimacy cast a shadow over all his life since he was pledged to silence as to the identity of his natural father, although a handsome annuity was paid to his mother&quot;.

From age 3 to 8 Edward lived and was educated in Manchester, Churchtown, Salford and Claughton. In 1833, the family moved to Lancaster and he attended the private school of James Wallasey, where he first took an interest in chemistry, in particular, reading the work of Joseph Priestley borrowed from the Mechanics Institute Library.

At age 12, Edward moved to the Lancaster Free Grammar School (later Lancaster Royal Grammar School), that had also educated scientists William Whewell and Sir Richard Owen.
According to Frankland himself, his interest in chemistry was furthered by a case held in the court of Lancaster Castle, which was adjacent to the Free Grammar School (then located on Castle Hill, Lancaster). It was an action brought by the Corporation of Liverpool against Mr. Muspratt for committing a nuisance by allowing muriatic acid gas (HCl) to escape from his chemical works in Liverpool. &quot;I was already much interested in chemistry, my step-father allowed me to stay away from school in order to attend the trial&quot;
Frankland wished to become a doctor, but the cost of training was &quot;absolutely prohibitive&quot;. So the only entrance for him was &quot;the back door of a druggist&#x27;s shop&quot;

In 1840, Edward was indentured by his step-father, William Helm as an apprentice to Stephen Ross, a Lancaster pharmacist. and his duties included &quot;mortar and pestle work&quot;, pounding and mixing large quantities of chemicals to create medicinal preparations such as ointments.

During the latter part of his six-year apprenticeship, Frankland also attended the Lancaster Mechanics&#x27; Institute (later to become The Storey, attending classes in a makeshift cottage laboratory made available to local apprentices and other young men by a local doctor, James Johnson. Others in that youthful circle were the scientific writer Robert Galloway (also apprenticed to Ross) and the anatomist William Turner.
With support and encouragement from Johnson, Frankland acquired, in 1845, a place in the Westminster laboratory of Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair. Whilst there, Frankland attended Playfair&#x27;s lecture course; at the end of it he passed the examination—the only written one he ever sat.

In summer 1847 Frankland visited Germany and met some of Playfair&#x27;s chemistry contacts there, including Robert Bunsen. In August 1847, Frankland accepted a post as science-master at a boarding school (Queenwood College) in Hampshire, but the following summer he opted to return to Germany to be a full-time student at the University of Marburg. Robert Bunsen was an influential teacher at Marburg at the time, and Bunsen&#x27;s reputation was one of the main attractions for Frankland. The following year Frankland accepted an invitation to move to Justus von Liebig&#x27;s laboratory at Giessen. By this stage, Frankland already had his own research agenda and had published some original research in chemistry.

In January 1850, Lyon Playfair revealed his intention to resign from his professorship at Putney College for Civil Engineers in London and arrange to have Frankland become his successor. Hence Frankland abruptly terminated his studies in Germany and returned to take up Playfair&#x27;s former position in England. A year later Frankland became professor of chemistry at a newly established school now known as the University of Manchester. In 1857, he became lecturer in chemistry at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London, and, in 1863, professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution, London. For two decades Frankland also had a teaching role at the Royal School of Mines in London; and he taught briefly (from 1859 to 1861) at the Royal India Military College at Addiscombe, Surrey.

Edward Frankland was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1853. He was awarded the Society&#x27;s Royal Medal in 1857 and its Copley Medal in 1894 and was also a member of the X Club. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1897.

Edward Frankland became engaged to Sophie Fick, sister of physiologist Adolf Eugen Fick, from Kassel in October 1849. They had first met on Frankland&#x27;s 1847 trip. They married on 27 February 1851 at St Martin-in-the-Fields. After Sophie&#x27;s death from tuberculosis in 1874, in 1875 Edward Frankland married Ellen Frances Grenside. He died in Golaa, a village in the Gudbrand Valley whilst on a holiday in Norway. His body was returned to Britain and he was buried near his home in Reigate, Surrey.

His son Percy Frankland was also a noted chemist and a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Frankland&#x27;s papers are held at the John Rylands Library, Manchester.

== Scientific work ==

From an early age, Frankland engaged in original research with great success. Analytical problems, such as the isolation of certain organic radicals, attracted his attention at first, but he soon turned to chemical syntheses. Robert Bunsen is believed to have directed his students, Edward Frankland and Hermann Kolbe, to the investigation of cacodyl, leading to Frankland&#x27;s discovery of organometallic compounds. After his return to England Frankland achieved the synthesis of diethylzinc and dimethylzinc by the reaction of ethyl iodide and methyl iodide with metallic zinc.

The theoretical deductions Frankland drew from considering these bodies were even more interesting and important than the bodies themselves. Perceiving a molecular isonomy between them and the inorganic compounds of the metals from which they may be formed, Frankland saw their true molecular type in the oxygen, sulphur or chlorine compounds of those metals, from which he held them to be derived by the substitution of an organic group for the oxygen, sulphur, &amp;c. In this way they enabled him to overthrow the theory of conjugate compounds, and they further led him in 1852 to publish the conception that the atoms of each elementary substance have a definite saturation capacity, so that they can only combine with a certain limited number of the atoms of other elements. The theory of valency thus founded has dominated the subsequent development of chemical doctrine, and forms the groundwork upon which the fabric of modern structural chemistry reposes. Edward Frankland&#x27;s 1852 publication on his discovery of the theory of valence was honoured by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 2015.

In applied chemistry Frankland&#x27;s great work was in connection with water-supply. Appointed a member of the second royal commission on the pollution of rivers in 1868, he was provided by the government with a completely equipped laboratory, in which, for a period of six years, he carried on the inquiries necessary for the purposes of that body, and was thus the means of bringing to light an enormous amount of valuable information respecting the contamination of rivers by sewage, trade-refuse, &amp;c., and the purification of water for domestic use. In 1865, when he succeeded August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the School of Mines, he undertook the duty of making monthly reports to the registrar-general on the character of the water supplied to London, and these he continued down to the end of his life. At one time he was an unsparing critic of its quality, but in later years he became strongly convinced of its general excellence and wholesomeness.

Frankland&#x27;s analyses were both chemical and bacteriological, and his dissatisfaction with the processes in vogue for the former at the time of his appointment caused him to spend two years in devising new and more accurate methods. In 1859 Frankland passed a night on the very top of Mont Blanc in company with John Tyndall. One of the purposes of the expedition was to discover whether the rate of combustion of a candle varies with the density of the atmosphere in which it is burnt, a question which was answered in the negative. Other observations made by Frankland at the time formed the starting-point of a series of experiments which yielded far-reaching results. He noticed that at the summit the candle gave a very poor light, and was thereby led to investigate the effect produced on luminous flames by varying the pressure of the atmosphere in which they are burning. He found that pressure increases luminosity, so that hydrogen, for example, the flame of which gives no light in normal circumstances, burns with a luminous flame under a pressure of ten or twenty atmospheres, and the inference he drew was that the presence of solid particles is not the only factor that determines the light-giving power of a flame, Further, he showed that the spectrum of a dense ignited gas resembles that of an incandescent liquid or solid, and he traced a gradual change in the spectrum of an incandescent gas under increasing pressure, the sharp lines observable when it is extremely attenuated broadening out to nebulous bands as the pressure rises, till they merge in the continuous spectrum as the gas approaches a density comparable with that of the liquid state. An application of these results to solar physics in conjunction with Sir Norman Lockyer led to the view that at least the external layers of the sun cannot consist of matter in the liquid or solid forms, but must be composed of gases or vapours.

Frankland and Lockyer were also the discoverers of helium, along with Pierre Jules César Janssen. In 1868, they noticed, in the solar spectrum, a bright yellow line which did not correspond to any substance then known. It was this line which they attributed to the then hypothetical element, helium. This was the first time an element was discovered on an extraterrestrial world before being found on the earth.

== Lectures ==
Frankland gave a variety of lectures at the Royal Institution. In 1862, 1864, and 1866, Frankland was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, speaking on the topics &quot;Air and Water&quot;; &quot;The Chemistry of a Coal&quot; and &quot;The Chemistry of Gases&quot; respectively.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command that is used in several popular operating systems to send signals to running processes.

==Implementations==
===Unix and Unix-like===
In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, codice_1 is a command used to send a signal to a process. By default, the message sent is the termination signal, which requests that the process exit. But &quot;kill&quot; is something of a misnomer; the signal sent may have nothing to do with process killing. The codice_1 command is a wrapper around the codice_4 system call, which sends signals to processes or process groups on the system, referenced by their numeric process IDs (PIDs) or process group IDs (PGIDs). codice_1 is always provided as a standalone utility as defined by the POSIX standard. However, most shells have built-in codice_1 commands that may slightly differ from it.

There are many different signals that can be sent (see &quot;signal&quot; for a full list), although the signals in which users are generally most interested are SIGTERM (&quot;terminate&quot;) and SIGKILL (&quot;kill&quot;). The default signal sent is SIGTERM. Programs that handle this signal can do useful cleanup operations (such as saving configuration information to a file) before quitting. However, many programs do not implement a special handler for this signal, and so a default signal handler is called instead. Other times, even a process that has a special handler has gone awry in a way that prevents it from properly handling the signal.

All signals except for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP (&quot;stop&quot;) can be &quot;intercepted&quot; by the process, meaning that a special function can be called when the program receives those signals. The two exceptions SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are only seen by the host system&#x27;s kernel, providing reliable ways of controlling the execution of processes. SIGKILL kills the process, and SIGSTOP pauses it until a SIGCONT (&quot;continue&quot;) is received.

Unix provides security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from killing other processes. Essentially, for a process to send a signal to another, the owner of the signaling process must be the same as the owner of the receiving process or be the superuser.

The available signals all have different names, and are mapped to certain numbers. The specific mapping between numbers and signals can vary between Unix implementations. SIGTERM is often numbered 15 while SIGKILL is often numbered 9.

====Examples====
A process can be sent a SIGTERM signal in four ways (the process ID is &#x27;1234&#x27; in this case):
kill 1234
kill -s TERM 1234
kill -TERM 1234
kill -15 1234
The process can be sent a SIGKILL signal in three ways:
kill -s KILL 1234
kill -KILL 1234
kill -9 1234
Other useful signals include HUP, TRAP, INT, SEGV and ALRM. HUP sends the SIGHUP signal. Some daemons, including Apache and Sendmail, re-read configuration files upon receiving SIGHUP, so the kill command may be used for this too. A SIGINT signal can be generated very simply by pressing  in most Unix shells. It is also common for  to be mapped to SIGTSTP (&quot;terminal stop&quot;), and for  (backslash) to be mapped to SIGQUIT, which can force a program to do a core dump.

====Related programs====
*killall - on some variations of Unix, such as Solaris, this utility is automatically invoked when the system is going through a shutdown. It behaves much like the kill command above, but instead of sending a signal to an individual process, the signal is sent to all processes on the system. However, on others such as IRIX, Linux, and FreeBSD, an argument is supplied specifying the name of the process (or processes) to kill. For instance, to kill a process such as an instance of the XMMS music player invoked by codice_7, the user would run the command codice_8. This would kill all processes named codice_7, and is equivalent to codice_10 on systems like Solaris.
*pkill - signals processes based on name and other attributes. It was introduced in Solaris 7 and has since been reimplemented for Linux, NetBSD and OpenBSD. pkill makes killing processes based on their name much more convenient: e.g. to kill a process named &quot;firefox&quot; without pkill (and without pgrep), one would have to type codice_11 whereas with pkill, one can simply type codice_12.
*xkill - if called without any parameters, the mouse cursor changes from an arrow to an &quot;x&quot; icon, and the user can click on a window to force the X server to close the connection with the client owning the window. This often causes the process to terminate when it detects that its connection to the X server has been closed.

===Microware OS-9===
The codice_1 command is also available as a shell builtin in the OS-9 shell. It is used to kill another process by process ID.

Stop the process with the process ID &quot;7&quot;:
$ kill 7
===Microsoft Windows and ReactOS===

In Microsoft&#x27;s command-line interpreter Windows PowerShell, codice_1 is a predefined command alias for the codice_15 cmdlet.

Microsoft Windows XP, Vista and 7 include the command codice_16 to terminate processes. The usual syntax for this command is codice_17. An &quot;unsupported&quot; version of codice_1 was included in several releases of the Microsoft Windows Resource Kits available for Windows 98.

GNU versions of codice_1 have been ported via Cygwin and run inside of the Unix environment subsystem that Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX provides (Microsoft acquired Windows Services for Unix wholesale via their purchase of Softway Systems and their Interix product on September 17, 1999).
The ReactOS implementation is based on the Windows variant. It was developed by Andrew Riedi, Andrew Nguyen, and He Yang. It is licensed under the LGPLv2.1 or later. 

====Examples====
Find all processes beginning with the letter &quot;p&quot; that were developed by Microsoft and use more than 10 MB of memory and kill them:
PS C:\&gt; ps p* | where { $_.Company -like &quot;Microsoft*&quot; -and $_.WorkingSet -gt 10MB } | kill -confirm

Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Performing operation &quot;Stop-Process&quot; on Target &quot;powershell (6832)&quot;.
[Y] Yes [A] Yes to All [N] No [L] No to All [S] Suspend [?] Help (default is &quot;Y&quot;): A
PS C:\&gt;
Here is a simpler example, which asks the process Explorer.exe to terminate:
PS C:\&gt; taskkill /im explorer.exe
This example forces the process to terminate:
PS C:\&gt; taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
Processes can also be killed by their PID number:
PS C:\&gt; taskkill /pid 3476

===Microsoft Singularity===
Singularity shell, the standard shell for Microsoft Research&#x27;s microkernel operating system Singularity includes a codice_1 command to terminate background processes.

====Examples====
Stop the process with the name &quot;SampleProcess&quot;:
Singularity&gt;kill SampleProcess
Stop the process with the process identifier &quot;42&quot;:
Singularity&gt;kill 42
===Plan 9 from Bell Labs===
Under Plan 9 from Bell Labs, the kill program does not actually perform this termination, nor does it take process IDs. Rather, it takes the actual names of processes and outputs the commands for rc, the shell used by Plan 9, to kill the process.

A similar command provided is called codice_21, which does the same but for processes that refuse to be killed this way.

====Examples====
For example, to kill all instances of troff, one types:

 kill troff | rc

===Others===
The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

<doc id="940600" wikidata="Q5105270" url="?curid=940600" title="Chorus Communication Limited">
<text>Chorus, officially Chorus Communication Limited, was a communications provider in Ireland offering internet, television and telephone services. It was owned by Liberty Global Europe and ultimately controlled by John C. Malone&#x27;s Liberty Media.

Based in Limerick (and also with offices in Cork), it owned the cable television licenses for the cities of Cork and Limerick as well as for most towns where cable networks existed. A small number of towns (notably Dungarvan) had locally run cable networks. It also held the MMDS licences for many towns across Ireland. The cable networks in the cities of Dublin, Galway and Waterford and the MMDS services for towns in those counties as well Mayo were operated by NTL Ireland.

In 2005 NTL sold its Irish operation to Liberty Global. As a result, cable and MMDS services across the country were temporarily branded &quot;Chorus NTL&quot; before ultimately rebranding to &quot;UPC Ireland&quot; (now Virgin Media Ireland) in 2010, bringing them into line with Liberty Global&#x27;s TV offerings elsewhere in Europe.

==History==
The company was formed in 2000 following the buyout of CMI (Cable Management Ireland) by Irish Multichannel (an offshoot of Princes Holdings Limited). Irish Multichannel, a joint venture between Independent News and Media and TCI (later Liberty Media) had been the result of a series of mergers between several regional companies, most notably East Coast Multichannel, Horizon Multichannel, Cork Communications and Westward Cable. Irish Multichannel held the MMDS licences for most of Ireland apart from counties Dublin, Galway and Waterford which were held by Cablelink (later NTL Ireland). It also had an extensive cable network in Cork and Limerick. CMI was owned by a number of Irish businessmen. Its network was pure CATV, having been assembled from a number of private providers. it was thus expected that the newly formed Chorus would have to perform some extreme network consolidation. It went on to purchase Suir-Nore Relays shortly after the merger.

In late 2004 Independent News and Media sold its shares in Chorus to Liberty Media International which in turn transferred its shareholding in the company to its affiliate, UGC Europe (now Liberty Global Europe). On 12 December 2005 Liberty Global Europe completed its acquisition of NTL Ireland, the country&#x27;s other major cable operator. The two companies were soon integrated into one business called Chorus NTL, later adopting Liberty Global&#x27;s UPC brand.

==Services==

The fractured nature of the network led to consumers in different areas getting different channel packages and consequently extreme problems for the customer services team who often had no idea what channel package a customer had least beyond core channels. Chorus&#x27; customer service was the subject of much criticism. In November 2004 it was reported that the company came last in a global customer service survey of 64 telecom companies, receiving a score of just 2.6 out of 10 for response times to customer queries from the Customer Respect Index (CRI). Chorus lost significant market share to Sky who launched their digital satellite service in Ireland in the early 2000s.

Following the formation of the unified company, over €130M was spent on network infrastructure, including fibre and microwave links between regions. This meant customers who were using CATV in the &quot;Community Antenna&quot; sense now generally got a significantly higher quality signal, although poor transmission networks and high compression on microwave links caused MPEG-esque motion problems, even on analogue links.

Chorus provided a bewildering array of services including analogue MMDS, digital MMDS, analogue cable, digital cable, broadband as well as dialup internet and both landline and wireless (not to be confused with mobile) telephone lines. Some areas which could receive MMDS from Irish Multichannel also had cable inherited from CMI, resulting in a choice of services, often one analogue and the other digital. Figures from December 2004 show that the company had a reach of 319,000 homes of which 211,000 had cable or MMDS, 600 had broadband and 500 had telephone services. The future looked bleak for their MMDS operations after BBC and ITV services went free to air on satellite. These channels were often seen as the main reason for keeping the analogue service and were a key feature in Chorus marketing.

The Chorus Digital package was launched on 2 October 2000. It offered a standard line-up in all areas, although it was geared towards MMDS rather than cable and thus offered a smaller line-up than the larger capacity of cable would allow. Alongside the traditional terrestrial stations, channels from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, BSkyB, Flextech, and others are carried. The Irish national channels were offered via MMDS on digital for the first time. On analogue MMDS only TV3 was required to be carried because analogue MMDS in Ireland offered a maximum of 12 channels.

From 2000 to 2007, Chorus offered a sports channel which specialised in Gaelic Athletic Association coverage. Outside of Cork, the company carried the basic channel pack on all analogue cable links unencrypted to save on decoder equipment. Premium channels including Sky Sports and Sky Movies were always available, with more movies as well as the Fantasy Channel in some areas.

In May 2005 the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland announced that it was issuing Chorus with a ten-year broadcasting contract for a channel to replace the sports channel to carry documentaries, arts programming and an expanded selection of sports coverage, including motor sports. Had this channel launched when initially licensed, it would have been the first Irish broad format channel specifically for closed-access systems. It was beaten to this milestone by the short-lived City Channel. The licensing documents referred to it as &quot;Chorus TV&quot;.

=== Limerick City ===
Analogue and digital MMDS services were available in Limerick from a transmitter on Woodcock Hill. The city&#x27;s cable TV system descends from Westward Cable (later Irish Multichannel) and installation of the network began in the early 1980s. This covered most of the city as far as Castletroy on the south side and Caherdavin to the north. Unfortunately it never reached some areas of the city (e.g. Clare Street) and most housing developments built since the 90s have not been linked to the network. only analogue CATV was available on the system, with 18 unencrypted channels (including Channel 6 and Chorus TV) and some encrypted channels (such as Sky Sports 1 and Sky Movies 1). Customers were supplied with cumbersome old Jerrold/General Instrument decoders to avail of the encrypted channels. Signal quality varied greatly and was often quite poor due to the age of the cables and related equipment. MPEG compression artefacts were also noticeably high on some channels sourced from digital MMDS signals. Interruption of service was also quite frequent. Channels previously on VHF Band I frequencies were moved to Band III positions to make way for the introduction of the cable broadband service. Digital cable television and broadband services were slowly introduced across the city from late 2006.

==Late 2000s==

In May 2005, Morgan Stanley bought the Irish assets of NTL, on behalf of Chorus&#x27; owners UGC Europe (now Liberty Global Europe), with the intention of selling them on to Liberty once a Competition Authority investigation had been completed.

NTL Ireland included a certain amount of fibre backbone, and a cable network (digital is available throughout most of the network, but the vast majority of customers still take just analogue) that covers the areas of Dublin, Galway, and Waterford for which Chorus are not licensed. NTL also offer broadband to a higher number of subscribers, and did offer a telephone service, which was removed after it was revealed that the handsets they used could catch fire. NTL also own the remaining MMDS licences (for cells covering counties Dublin, Galway, Mayo, and Waterford).

On 12 December 2005, Liberty Global Europe completed its acquisition of NTL Ireland, which became part of the UPC Broadband group within Liberty.

It is assumed that Liberty will merge NTL and Chorus, under their UPC (for television) and Chello (for internet) brands, and continue to consolidate their network. The company formed to acquire the network from Morgan Stanley is &quot;UPC Ireland N.V.&quot;, fuelling speculation this will be the eventual name. A combined company would own all the MMDS licences and almost all the cable licences in the Republic of Ireland (the local networks in Dungarvan, County Waterford and Longford town being the only major exception). They have announced that $200 million is to be spent replacing all coaxial trunk with fibre and upgrading all cable into homes with cable capable of carrying signals up to 850 MHz. This is claimed to be able to carry multi-channel cable and 30 Mbit/s internet concurrently.

From December 2006, Chorus began running NTL Ireland&#x27;s customer service from Limerick, in line with UPC&#x27;s merger of the two companies. On 22 March 2007, Chorus changed its digital cable line up to a subset of NTL Ireland&#x27;s line up, using the same EPG numbering system as NTL. The MMDS lineup is still unchanged.

Chorus was renamed as UPC Ireland in 2010, along with its sister company NTL Ireland. In preparation for this, from July 2007 advertising for both companies began using a composite logo reading &quot;Chorus NTL – A UPC Company&quot;.

<text>Sirsalis is a relatively young lunar impact crater located near the western lunar limb, to the southwest of the Oceanus Procellarum. The crater lies across a ridge that runs in a north–south direction. It has a sharp edge and a low central peak. The crater overlaps the slightly larger and older Sirsalis A to the west-southwest, and the two form a distinctive feature.

To the east is a rille system named the Rimae Sirsalis. The longest of these rilles follows a line running approximately north-northeast to south-southwest, just clearing the southeastern rim of Sirsalis by about 10 kilometers. This long rille runs 330 kilometers from the shore of Oceanus Procellarum until it crosses the crater Darwin A and intersects the Rimae Darwin to the east of Darwin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sirsalis.

<text>MultiLisp is a functional programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp, and of its dialect Scheme, extended with constructs for parallel computing execution and shared memory. These extensions involve side effects, rendering MultiLisp nondeterministic. Along with its parallel-programming extensions, MultiLisp also had some unusual garbage collection and task scheduling algorithms. Like Scheme, MultiLisp was optimized for symbolic computing. Unlike some parallel programming languages, MultiLisp incorporated constructs for causing side effects and for explicitly introducing parallelism.

It was designed by Robert H. Halstead Jr., in the early 1980s for use on the 32-processor Concert multiprocessor then being developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and implemented in Interlisp. It influenced the development of the Scheme dialects Gambit, and Interlisp-VAX.

==PCALL and FUTURE==
MultiLisp achieves parallelism with the PCALL macro, where

codice_1

is equivalent to

codice_2

except that the arguments codice_3 etc. are explicitly allowed to be evaluated in parallel; this circumvents the usual order of evaluation, which is sequential and left to right. It also makes use of a parallel programming construct called futures, which resembles forking, combined with lazy evaluation. Using this construct, an expression such as

codice_4

can be written, which will overlap the evaluation of the expressions A and B, not only with each other, but with computations that use the result of the cons call, until an operation is performed that needs correct information about the value of A or B.

<doc id="940606" wikidata="Q386191" url="?curid=940606" title="Population growth">
<text>Population growth is the increase in the number of people in a population or dispersed group. The global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 8.2 billion in 2025. Actual global human population growth amounts to around 70 million annually, or 0.85% per year. As of 2024, The United Nations projects that global population will peak in the mid-2080s at around 10.3 billion. The UN&#x27;s estimates have decreased strongly in recent years due to sharp declines in global birth rates. 
Others have challenged many recent population projections as having underestimated population growth.

The world human population has been growing since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1350. A mix of technological advancement that improved agricultural productivity and sanitation and medical advancement that reduced mortality increased population growth. In some geographies, this has slowed through the process called the demographic transition, where many nations with high standards of living have seen a significant slowing of population growth. This is in direct contrast with less developed contexts, where population growth is still happening. Globally, the rate of population growth has declined from a peak of 2.2% per year in 1963. 

Population growth alongside increased consumption is a driver of environmental concerns, such as biodiversity loss and climate change, due to overexploitation of natural resources for human development. International policy focused on mitigating the impact of human population growth is concentrated in the Sustainable Development Goals which seeks to improve the standard of living globally while reducing the impact of society on the environment while advancing human well-being. 
==History==
World population has been rising continuously since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1350. Population began growing rapidly in the Western world during the industrial revolution. The most significant increase in the world&#x27;s population has been since the 1950s, mainly due to medical advancements and increases in agricultural productivity.

=== Haber process ===
Due to its dramatic impact on the human ability to grow food, the Haber process, named after one of its inventors, the German chemist Fritz Haber, served as the &quot;detonator of the population explosion&quot;, enabling the global population to increase from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 7.7 billion by November 2019.

=== Thomas McKeown hypotheses ===

Some of the reasons for the &quot;Modern Rise of Population&quot; were particularly investigated by the British health scientist Thomas McKeown (1912–1988). In his publications, McKeown challenged four theories about the population growth:

# McKeown stated that the growth in Western population, particularly surging in the 19th century, was not so much caused by an increase in fertility, but largely by a decline of mortality particularly of childhood mortality followed by infant mortality,
# The decline of mortality could largely be attributed to rising standards of living, whereby McKeown put most emphasis on improved nutritional status,
# McKeown questioned the effectiveness of public health measures, including sanitary reforms, vaccination and quarantine,
# The “McKeown thesis&quot; states that curative medicine measures played little role in mortality decline, not only prior to the mid-20th century but also until well into the 20th century.
Although the McKeown thesis has been heavily disputed, recent studies have confirmed the value of his ideas. His work is pivotal for present day thinking about population growth, birth control, public health and medical care. McKeown had a major influence on many population researchers, such as health economists and Nobel prize winners Robert W. Fogel (1993) and Angus Deaton (2015). The latter considered McKeown as &quot;the founder of social medicine&quot;.

==Growth rate models==
The &quot;population growth rate&quot; is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period, expressed as a fraction of the initial population. Specifically, population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period, often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period. This can be written as the formula, valid for a sufficiently small time interval:

:formula_1

A positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing, while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing. A growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period—a growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the birth rates, death rates, immigration rates, and age distribution between the two times.

A related measure is the net reproduction rate. In the absence of migration, a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing, while a net reproduction rate less than one (sub-replacement fertility) indicates that the population of females is decreasing.

Most populations do not grow exponentially, rather they follow a logistic model. Once the population has reached its carrying capacity, it will stabilize and the exponential curve will level off towards the carrying capacity, which is usually when a population has depleted most its natural resources. In the world human population, growth may be said to have been following a linear trend throughout the last few decades.
===Logistic equation===

The growth of a population can often be modelled by the logistic equation

:formula_2

where
* formula_3 = the population after time t;
* formula_4 = time a population grows;
* formula_5 = the relative growth rate coefficient;
* formula_6 = the carrying capacity of the population; defined by ecologists as the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain.

As it is a separable differential equation, the population may be solved explicitly, producing a logistic function:

:formula_7,

where formula_8 and formula_9 is the initial population at time 0.

==Global population growth rate==


The world population growth rate peaked in 1963 at 2.2% per year and subsequently declined. In 2017, the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1%. The CIA World Factbook gives the world annual birthrate, mortality rate, and growth rate as 1.86%, 0.78%, and 1.08% respectively. The last 100 years have seen a massive fourfold increase in the population, due to medical advances, lower mortality rates, and an increase in agricultural productivity made possible by the Green Revolution.

The annual increase in the number of living humans peaked at 88.0 million in 1989, then slowly declined to 73.9 million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006. In 2017, the human population increased by 83 million. Generally, developed nations have seen a decline in their growth rates in recent decades, though annual growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, and also in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

In some countries the population is declining, especially in Eastern Europe, mainly due to low fertility rates, high death rates and emigration. In Southern Africa, growth is slowing due to the high number of AIDS-related deaths. Some Western Europe countries might also experience population decline. Japan&#x27;s population began decreasing in 2005.

The United Nations Population Division projects world population to reach 11.2 billion by the end of the 21st century. 
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that the global population will peak in 2064 at 9.73 billion and decline to 8.89 billion in 2100.
 A 2014 study in &quot;Science&quot; concludes that the global population will reach 11 billion by 2100, with a 70% chance of continued growth into the 22nd century. The German Foundation for World Population reported in December 2019 that the global human population grows by 2.6 people every second, and could reach 8 billion by 2023.

==Growth by country==
According to United Nations population statistics, the world population grew by 30%, or 1.6 billion humans, between 1990 and 2010. In number of people the increase was highest in India (350 million) and China (196 million). Population growth rate was among highest in the United Arab Emirates (315%) and Qatar (271%).

Many of the world&#x27;s countries, including many in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and South East Asia, have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the Cold War. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc. in some of the less fortunate countries. For example, the population of Chad has ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009, further straining its resources. Vietnam, Mexico, Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the DRC are witnessing a similar growth in population.

The following table gives some example countries or territories:

<text>Andrew Ritchie (born 23 February 1956) is a Scottish retired professional footballer.

==Career at Morton==
Born in Bellshill, as a teenager Ritchie had trials with Manchester United, Coventry City, Everton, Middlesbrough and Rangers, but chose to join Celtic in 1971, aged 15. Soon after, Ritchie was &#x27;farmed&#x27; out to Junior team Kirkintilloch Rob Roy. At Celtic, Ritchie had numerous disagreements with manager Jock Stein, which led to his transfer to Morton. As part of the transfer, Morton goalkeeper Roy Baines joined Celtic in exchange for Ritchie and a payment of £10,000.

Ritchie is most famous for his seven years at Greenock side Morton, during which he scored 118 goals. He was revered by the club&#x27;s fans and earned the nicknames &quot;the King of Cappielow Park&quot; and &quot;The Idle Idol&quot;. He made his debut for Morton on 28 October 1976 and scored 133 goals in 246 games for the club. He was the top scorer in the Premier Division in 1978–79.

Ritchie was famous for what, by the standard of most professional footballers, was a rotund build and apparently blase demeanour. Scottish football journalist Chick Young saw Ritchie as &quot;the epitome of the Scottish footballer – a fat, lazy bastard, but with great ball skill&quot;. He was renowned in Scotland for his expertise in free-kicks, reputedly perfected by observing Brazil train for the 1974 World Cup. His signature, demonstrated in more than one competitive match, was the ability to bend the ball into the net from a corner kick. His best and most famous goal was scored against Aberdeen at Cappielow Park.

In an incident, he almost broke his leg falling over Greenock Telegraph photographer, Jim Sinclair, after he failed to stop on a long run up the field.

Whilst at Morton, Ritchie won a solitary cap for the Scotland national under-21 football team as an overage player, against Belgium.

==Career after Morton==
Ritchie was transferred from Morton to Motherwell in 1983. He was player-manager for Albion Rovers in season 1984–85. He retired in 1985, aged 28. Later, he took up a coaching and scouting role for Celtic and subsequent scouting roles for Aston Villa and Manchester City. He became an official SPL match observer.
A biography, &quot;The King of Cappielow&quot; was published on 11 October 2008. A more warts and all account of Ritchie&#x27;s life appeared in &quot;Flawed Genius; Scottish Football&#x27;s Self Destructive Mavericks&quot;&#x27; (Birlinn 2009).

==Awards==
Ritchie received the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year award in 1979. In common with the rest of his teammates at Scottish Premier Division club Greenock Morton, he was a part-time footballer. On the day of the award ceremony Ritchie worked a shift in his other job laying tar as a road surfacer.

In 2005, he was voted &#x27;cult hero&#x27; in an internet poll for the BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Football Focus&quot; programme, receiving 64 per cent of votes cast for Morton players.

==Quotes==
Some quotes from the book &quot;Greenock Morton 1874–1999&quot; by Vincent P Gillen.()

*&quot;Andy Ritchie – I can close my eyes and see the day as clear as you like. Morton were getting a doing by Dundee Utd and the defence was under siege. Big Andy was standing at the centre circle, hands inside his shirt sleeves, looking at the seagulls, bored out of his skull, when Davie Hayes blootered the ball out – it was just Andy and Paul Hegarty left, and Andy, you couldn&#x27;t slip a copy of the Greenock Telegraph under his feet when he jumped.

:Hegarty jumped and missed and Ritchie did what Pelé couldn&#x27;t do and volleyed the ball past Hamish from the half way line!

*&quot;Big Andy was always full of the verbal – always had a smile on his face, especially when he nutmegged you. I think in fact with the goal he scored in the Scottish Cup, players were always that terrified of Andy nutmegging them that they would shut their legs and he curled it roon them, you know.

:He had such a good footballing brain that he sussed things like that. He had scored the one from 50 yards and he was in his own half, nobody near him and he shouted &quot;Big Yin, ye&#x27;d better pick me up, I&#x27;ll probably score from here&quot; – you&#x27;re talking 60–70 yards and I was thinking, he&#x27;s got a point, I better get across. He was the scourge of the Dons in those days.&quot; – Alex McLeish

*&quot;Ritchie came at the right time – he was the cream at the top of the cake at the time...he got the label of being a lazy player and he nurtured that a little bit ... I used to train him on his own, he trained hard. He was a character, his skills were unbelievable, his passing, his vision, his dead ball situations. there was a free kick at a preseason game, we had a wee thing with Watford at the time ... and they came about three seasons in a row. I can always remember this one game, Andy had a free kick just over the centre circle ... they don&#x27;t put a wall up or anything and Mick (Jackson) says, it was his first game, &quot;He&#x27;s not going to shoot from there&quot;, just leave him I says, he hits the ball in the roof of the net ... he was that good&quot; – Benny Rooney

<text>Smithson is a small lunar impact crater located in the northeast part of Mare Fecunditatis. It is a circular, cup-shaped feature with a slightly higher albedo than the surrounding, dark lunar mare. It was previously identified as Taruntius N before being renamed by the IAU. Taruntius itself lies to the west-northwest, in the northwestern part of the same mare.

<doc id="940615" wikidata="Q2255269" url="?curid=940615" title="Crystal Brook, South Australia">
<text>Crystal Brook is a town in the Mid North of South Australia, 197 kilometres north of the capital, Adelaide. According to the 2021 Census, the population of the town was 1,322. Crystal Brook is in a very picturesque location, being at the start of the Flinders Ranges. The town has multiple viewing points and parks. It was named after the spring-fed creek next to which it was founded. 

Crystal Brook is the second largest town after the city of Port Pirie in the Southern Flinders Ranges area. The shady peppercorn trees grace the main street, Bowman Street. The area where the present town is now was founded in 1839 by Edward John Eyre who was passing through the region. He named it after the beautiful sparkling clear water and named it &#x27;Chrystal Brook&#x27;.

Crystal Brook is north of Adelaide. The town has had some growth over the past year or two with more proposed job opportunities in the region. Crystal Brook is situated on Goyder&#x27;s Line near the border of two climate systems. The township of Crystal Brook is surrounded by an intense farming region. As the town has experienced some growth in the past few years it has pushed housing development to the western side of the original township and across the creek.

The town benefits from a temperate mediterranean climate zone, making possible slightly more intense farming in the region. To the south to south-east and west lies more intense farming and to the north-west lies some marginal, semi-arid farmland.

It is home to nearby Bowman Park, a nature preserve that is situated in the Crystal Brook Valley and has an abundance of wildlife and shady camping spots right next to the Crystal Brook Creek. The park contains history that dated back to the 1800s. The original homestead that belonged to the Bowman Brothers, which the park was named after, is there overlooking the Crystal Brook.

Summers in Crystal Brook are warm to hot and can be mostly dry . Winters are wet and cold with day time temps reaching just average 13 degrees Celsius or less and night time temps around 5 degrees Celsius. Many days are overcast and drizzle.

==History==
The administrative land division the Hundred of Crystal Brook was proclaimed in 1871 in the vicinity of the confluence of the Rocky River and Broughton River. The township, near the eponymous Broughton River tributary, Crystal Brook, was surveyed in August 1874 and officially proclaimed on 12 November that year.

===Local government===
The District Council of Crystal Brook was established in 1882. It amalgamated with the District Council of Redhill in 1988 to form the District Council of Crystal Brook-Redhill which continued to be seated at Crystal Brook. From 1997 Crystal Brook has been locally governed by the Port Pirie Regional Council following a merger between Crystal Brook-Redhill and the Port Pirie City councils.

===Military history===
During World War II, Crystal Brook was the location of RAAF No.31 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), built in 1942 and closed on 14 June 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).

==Infrastructure==

===Water===
Crystal Brook (or creek) supplied water to the town until 1890 when the Beetaloo Reservoir was completed, which at the time was the largest concrete dam in the southern hemisphere.

===Broadband===
Broadband internet became available at Crystal Brook on 16 April 2005 after lobbying from residents. Both ADSL and ADSL2+ speeds are available to residential and business customers. National Broadband Network (NBN) wired services for the township became available on 7 October 2016. The old ADSL and PSTN infrastructure is expected to be turned off about 13 April 2018. Free Wi-Fi is provided by the local council in the main street, for the use of travelers and locals. NBN wireless broadband and satellite is available outside of the township area.

===Transport===
Crystal Brook serves as a major junction on the Sydney–Perth and the Adelaide–Darwin railway lines, both sharing the same approximately of track between Crystal Brook and Tarcoola. There is a triangular junction at Crystal Brook which joins Tarcoola, Adelaide and Sydney and sees regular trains each day in all directions.

==Entertainment and tourism==

=== Crystal Brook Show ===
The Crystal Brook Show has been held annually since the early 1880s. The 2020 and 2021 show has been cancelled due to COVID-19 social distancing requirements.

=== Heysen Trail ===
The town lies on the Heysen Trail, a -long walking trail from Cape Jervis to Parachilna Gorge.

Close to the north–south midpoint of the trail, Crystal Brook marks a change in climate. Hot, dry summers and mild winters lie to the north, and more temperate conditions to the south.

===Sport===
Crystal Brook&#x27;s sporting facilities cater for hockey, tennis, croquet, golf, lawn bowls, netball, basketball, swimming, gymnasium exercise, junior soccer, horse riding, motor-cross, football and cricket.

In regional competitions the town colours are red and white, with most teams known as &#x27;The Roosters&#x27;.

The Crystal Brook Football Club won the Northern Areas (Australian Rules) Football Association premiership for a record 19th time in 2012 and the town has twice staged a round of the Australian motor-cross championships.

<text>The Pierre de Coubertin Medal is a special decoration awarded by the International Olympic Committee that &quot;pays tribute to institutions with a pedagogical and educational role and to people who, through their research and the creation of intellectual works in the spirit of Pierre de Coubertin, contribute to the promotion of Olympism.&quot; It was designed by André Ricard Sala, with one face featuring a portrait of Coubertin and the other showing the Olympic motto and rings.

The medal is not the same award as the Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy, which was inaugurated in 1965 and is awarded by the International Fair Play Committee, although the two are often confused. For example, some news media reported on 22 August 2016 that Nikki Hamblin and Abbey D&#x27;Agostino had received the medal after colliding with each other on the track during the 5000 m event and assisting each other to continue the race. The New Zealand Olympic Committee said that no such award had yet been made, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; later corrected their report confirming &quot;the award was the International Fair Play Committee Award rather than the Pierre de Coubertin award&quot;. It is also regularly mentioned that the first winner of the Pierre de Coubertin Medal was the Italian bobsledder Eugenio Monti in 1964, although in fact he became the first winner of the Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy. Lawrence Lemieux didn&#x27;t receive the medal either.

A medal awarded since 1969 &quot;for outstanding merits in the Olympic Movement&quot; by the Austrian Olympic Committee (ÖOC) called the has given rise to further confusion. The first recipients at a ceremony held on 23 June 1969 at the Museum of the 20th Century in Vienna were Austrian President Franz Jonas, IOC President Avery Brundage, IOC member , the Minister of Education , the ÖOC President , and the ÖOC Hon. Secretary-General . Later recipients include , Pat Hickey, and Dieter Kalt Sr..

<doc id="940618" wikidata="Q1262718" url="?curid=940618" title="Duart Castle">
<text>Duart Castle, or Caisteal Dhubhairt in Scottish Gaelic, is a castle on the Isle of Mull, beside the Sound of Mull off the west coast of Scotland, within the council area of Argyll and Bute. The castle dates back to the 13th century and is the seat of Clan MacLean. One source states that the castle was &quot;brought back from ruin in 1911&quot;. The regimental colours of the WW1 Canadian Expeditionary Force 236th Battalion (New Brunswick Kilties), CEF are laid up in the Great Hall.

==History==

Duart Castle was probably built by Clan MacDougall in the 13th century, and appears to have come into the hands of Clan MacLean in the following century.

In 1350, Lachlan Lubanach Maclean of Duart, the 5th Clan Chief, married Mary Macdonald, daughter of John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, and Duart was part of her dowry. John of Islay&#x27;s son, Donald Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, confirmed the castle by charter to the Macleans in 1390.

In 1647, Duart Castle was attacked and laid siege to by the Argyll government troops of Clan Campbell, but they were defeated and driven off by the Royalist troops of Clan MacLean.

In September 1653, a Cromwellian task force of six ships anchored off the castle, but the Macleans had already fled to Tiree. A storm blew up on the 13 September and three ships were lost, including . To the north of the castle is a Historic Marine Protected Area within which lie the remains of a wrecked 17th century warship, believed to be the Swan.

In 1678, the 9th Earl of Argyll, Chief of Clan Campbell and son of the late Marquess of Argyll, successfully invaded the Clan MacLean lands on the Isle of Mull and Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, fled the castle and withdrew to Cairnbulg Castle, and afterward to Kintail under the protection of the 3rd Earl of Seaforth.

In 1691, Duart Castle was surrendered by Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, to the 10th Earl of Argyll (who was later created, in 1701, the 1st Duke of Argyll). The Campbell clan partially demolished the castle, and the stones from the walls were scattered. The 5th Laird of Torloisk used some of the stones to build a cottage for his family close to the site of the castle.

By 1751 the remains of the castle were abandoned.

Descendants of the 1st Duke of Argyll sold the castle in 1801, to MacQuarrie, who then sold it to Carter-Campbell of Possil who kept it as a ruin within the grounds of his own estate to the north, Torosay Castle. He later sold his Torosay Estate, which now included the ruins of Castle Duart, to A. C. Guthrie in 1865. On 11 September 1911, the ruin was separated from the rest of the Torosay Estate and was bought by Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean, the 26th Chief of the Clan MacLean, and restored.

By 2012, additional restorations were required and a fund was set up to accept donations for this purpose. Phase 7 of the project was underway in 2020.

==Lairds of Duart==
Lairds are owners of an estate.
*Lachlan Lubanach Maclean, 5th Chief, 1st laird of Duart, it was part of his wife&#x27;s dowry.
*Red Hector of the Battles Maclean, 6th Chief, 2nd laird of Duart.
*Lachlan Bronneach Maclean, 7th Chief, 3rd laird of Duart.
*Lachlan Og Maclean, 8th Chief, 4th laird of Duart.
*Hector Odhar Maclean, 9th Chief, 5th laird of Duart.
*Lachlan Maclean, 10th Chief, 6th laird of Duart.
*Lachlan Cattanach Maclean, 11th Chief, 7th laird of Duart.
*Hector Mor Maclean, 12th Chief (1497–1568), 8th laird of Duart.
*Hector Og Maclean, 13th Chief, 9th laird of Duart.
*Lachlan Mor Maclean, 14th Chief, 10th laird of Duart.
*Sir Hector Og Maclean, 15th Chief, 11th laird of Duart.
*Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, 16th Laird of Duart. He surrendered Duart Castle in 1691 to The 10th Earl of Argyll, who demolished the castle. Sir John Maclean became the last laird of Duart until the restoration of the castle by Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean over 221 years later.

==2014 restoration==
In 2012, the centenary of the 1912 restoration, the Chief of Clan Maclean announced that his family could no longer afford the upkeep of the castle in light of the expense of major repairs. In the winter of 2013–14 the castle lost four ceilings, which were brought down by water penetration through the chimneys. In July 2014, a restoration appeal was launched.

==Film location==
The castle was used as a location in the 1945 film &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (as &quot;Castle of Sorne&quot;). It was also featured in the 1971 film &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins and in the 1999 film &quot;Entrapment&quot;, starring Sean Connery (who has MacLean ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side) and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

It is also the setting for the base of Buffy Summers in the first half of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;.

==Lighthouse==
To the south east of the castle is the Duart Point lighthouse. The lighthouse was built in 1900, as a memorial to Scottish novelist William Black.

<doc id="940620" wikidata="Q2341717" url="?curid=940620" title="Cosmetic dentistry">
<text>Cosmetic dentistry is generally used to refer to any dental work that improves the appearance (though not necessarily the functionality) of teeth, gums and/or bite. It primarily focuses on improvement in dental aesthetics in color, position, shape, size, alignment and overall smile appearance. Many dentists refer to themselves as &quot;cosmetic dentists&quot; regardless of their specific education, specialty, training, and experience in this field. This has been considered unethical with a predominant objective of marketing to patients. The American Dental Association does not recognize cosmetic dentistry as a formal specialty area of dentistry. However, there are still dentists that promote themselves as cosmetic dentists.

==Fields==
There are primarily two dental specialties that predominantly focus on dental aesthetics: prosthodontics and
orthodontics.

==Common cosmetic dentistry options==

===Types===
Cosmetic dentistry may involve:
# the addition of a dental material to teeth or gums – examples: bonding, porcelain veneers (laminates), crowns (caps), gum grafts
# the removal of tooth structure or gums – examples: enameloplasty, gingivectomy

====Whitening====
Whitening, or &quot;tooth bleaching&quot;, is the most common cosmetic dental procedure. Whitening is a safe process that is effective for most patients. Multiple whitening options are available, including over the counter products such as Crest Whitestrips, as well as dentist-supervised methods such as in-office treatments or at-home treatments involving trays with a peroxide gel.

Laser whitening is a teeth whitening technique in which gums are covered with a rubber dam and a bleaching chemical is applied on the teeth. A beam of argon laser, which is intended to accelerate the process of bleaching, is then projected upon the teeth. This laser activates the bleaching chemical and lightens the teeth color. Laser whitening is said to be six times more effective in teeth whitening compared to other procedures.

====Reshaping====
Tooth reshaping removes parts of the enamel to improve the appearance of the tooth. It may be used to correct a small chip, or to alter the length, shape or position of teeth, as well as when there is tooth size discrepancy; it can be used to correct crooked or excessively long teeth. The removed enamel is irreplaceable, and may sometimes expose dentin. It is also known as enameloplasty, odontoplasty, contouring, recontouring, cosmetic contouring, slenderizing, stripping. This procedure offers fast results and can even be a substitute for braces under certain circumstances.

====Bonding====
Bonding is a process in which an enamel-like dental composite material is color matched, applied to a tooth&#x27;s surface, sculpted into proper tooth contour, hardened and then polished. This process utilizes dental adhesives, which are solutions of resin monomers that make the resin dental substrate interaction possible. They are mainly classified into two techniques: self-etch or etch-and-rinse. An examples of a bonded restorations are inlays and onlays, which are used to repair decayed &amp; cracked teeth. Teeth damaged by small to moderate decay, erosion, or small fractures can be repaired with direct composite restorations bonded to the teeth. Aesthetics are especially critical in anterior composite restorations.

====Bridging====
Dental bridges are used to replace one or more missing teeth. Teeth on both sides of the space left by the missing teeth are prepared. A bridge is made up of abutments, the teeth that are prepped, and the missing, false teeth, which are called &quot;pontics&quot;. This procedure is used to replace one or more missing teeth and is cemented in. Bridges can consist of more than three teeth in total and the viability of any bridge is usually determined by applying Ante&#x27;s Law and assessing where in the mouth the teeth are. Most bridges are fixed, they can not be removed. Fixed bridges cannot be taken out in the same way that partial dentures can. In areas of the mouth that are under less stress, such as the front teeth, a cantilever bridge may be used. Cantilever bridges or Maryland Bridges are used to replace anterior or front missing teeth, are minimally invasive but do have a reputation for failure. Bridges require commitment to serious oral hygiene and carry risk. The average life of bridges is similar to that of crowns which is nearly ten years.

====Veneers====
Veneers are ultra-thin, custom-made porcelain laminates that are bonded directly to the teeth. They are an option for closing gaps, enhance the shape, or change the color of teeth that do not respond well to whitening procedures. In the majority of the cases, some level of tooth reduction is necessary for optimal results. To achieve a pleasing smile, dentists fabricate diagnostic mock-ups, which act as a tooth preparation guide before the fabrication of veneers, it allows the dentist to visualize the changes needed to be done on the patient&#x27;s teeth with respect to size, shape and proportion, its relation with gingival-contour, lip contour and smile line. Mock ups can be a great aid in fabricating pre-evaluation temporaries, which can give a preliminary evaluation to the esthetics, phonetics and teeth occlusion, in addition, it gives an opportunity to the clinicians to check if they need to do any corrections.

====Implants====
Dental implants are prosthetic replacements for missing teeth. According to ICOI (International Congress of Oral Implantologists) there are commonly three parts to what it is described as an implant: the implant device which is predominantly made of titanium (which is inserted into the bone), the abutment, and a dental crown or a denture which are connected to the implant through the abutment.

====Gum lifts====
A gum lift is a cosmetic dental procedure that raises and sculpts the gum line. The procedure involves reshaping the tissue and/or underlying bones to create the appearance of longer or more symmetrical teeth.

====Straightening====
Metal braces are used primarily to correct crowded or misaligned teeth. While correcting issues such as jaw alignment are the primary purpose, they can also improve aesthetics.

Clear aligners are used as an alternative to traditional metal braces. Clear aligners produce comparable results to metal braces and are preferred by some patients as they are less noticeable to others than traditional braces.

====Bite reclamation====
Bite reclamation is for patients who have had years of excessive wear to their teeth due to grinding or acid reflux can alter their vertical dimension. This gives them a closed or shorter look to their face and smile. By opening up their bite, a qualified professional can reclaim their vertical dimension.

==Materials==
In the past, dental fillings and other tooth restorations were made of gold, amalgam and other metals—some of which were veneered with porcelain. Now, dental work can be made entirely of porcelain or composite materials that more closely mimic the appearance of natural tooth structure. These tooth-colored materials are bonded to the underlying tooth structure with resin adhesives. Unlike silver fillings (amalgams) they are entirely free of mercury. Cosmetic dentistry has evolved to cover many new procedures and new dental materials are constantly introduced.

==Training==
The American Dental Association does not recognize cosmetic dentistry as a specialty. Prosthodontics is the only dental specialty under which the concentration of cosmetic/esthetic dentistry falls. General dentists may perform some simple cosmetic procedures. Consequently, there are questions regarding whether it is ethical for general dentists to treat &quot;smile makeovers&quot; or complex cosmetic and full-mouth reconstruction cases, as they are not qualified to address the complex needs of the patient.

===American College of Prosthodontists===
The American College of Prosthodontists  is a not-for-profit organization representing prosthodontists within organized dentistry and to the public, with more than 3,700 members worldwide. Prosthodontics is one of the twelve dental specialties defined by the American Dental Association, which recognizes the American College of Prosthodontists as the national organization representing the prosthodontic specialty- the dental specialty of cosmetic / esthetic dentistry, implant dentistry and reconstructive dentistry.

Membership is open to individuals who have graduated from or are currently enrolled in an ADA-accredited advanced prosthodontics program. The ACP is the only prosthodontic specialty association where membership is based solely on education credentials. Certified dental laboratory technician and members of the prosthodontic academic community may become Alliance members of the college.

===American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry===
The American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD) is the largest international dental organization in the world, composed of general dentists, specialists, and lab technicians focused on the art and science of cosmetic dentistry. Founded in 1984, the AACD has over 7,000 members in the United States and more than 70 countries around the globe. Members of the academy include dentists, dental laboratory technicians, educators, researchers, students, hygienists, corporations and dental auxiliaries. AACD members seek out continuing education through lectures, workshops, and publications in order to keep up-to-date with all of the advancements in cosmetic dental techniques and technology. In 1984, the AACD was formed and has filled the dire need for credentialing in cosmetic dentistry. The purpose of the American Board of Cosmetic Dentistry (ABCD) is the testing, analyzing, and evaluation of the services of dentists and laboratory technicians for the purpose of awarding AACD Accreditation in cosmetic dentistry. However, this certification is not approved or recognized by the American Dental Association.

American Society For Dental Aesthetics:
Conceived in 1976, the American Society for Dental Aesthetics was developed with a single purpose in mind: continuing dental education to teach dental health professionals the most advanced aesthetic and restorative techniques available. To become a member of the ASDA, a dentist must show a minimum of five years in dental practice, or postgraduate training of two years in an approved program; attendance to at least two ASDA sponsored continuing dental education seminars; nomination by a member accompanied by two letters of recommendation by Society members; presentation of five (5) cases illustrating the concepts of aesthetic dentistry.

== History ==
Newell Sill Jenkins (1840–1919) was an American dentist who practiced most of his life in Dresden, Germany. He developed the &quot;Jenkins porcelain enamel&quot; and improved, thus making a composition of the porcelain paste, porcelain inlays, dental crowns and bridges. Hence, he is regarded as the founder of aesthetic dentistry.

<text>Indigo Internet was established in late 1995 as an Internet service provider in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded by members of the Moyna family. Indigo was claimed to have over 16,000 subscribers in Ireland, though others questioned the validity and accuracy of these user numbers. It was purchased by Telecom Éireann (now eir) in 1997, and no longer operates as a separate entity.

==History==
Indigo Internet was launched in early 1996 by members of the Moyna family.

Shortly afterwards, the company was the subject to an article in Computimes, a special section on computing run once a week by the Irish Times, about a security breach in their system. This story, due to the interest in the development of the internet, made the front page of the Irish Times. Indigo had reportedly placed a file containing what was believed to be most if not all of their users usernames and encrypted passwords into a public file download area. The file was acquired by Computimes staff and opened to expose the security content.

Questions about the sources of funding for the original startup were highlighted by incidents such as the news that a man who US Federal officials said was a member of the Irish Republican Army was being held on charges of carrying $13,500 in counterfeit $50 bills at LaGuardia Airport, when arrested. The suspect, Donal Patrick Moyna, then 29 years old, of Dublin, was about to board a plane for Providence, R.I., when he was stopped by agents of the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 However, even though he was caught &quot;red&quot; handed, he was released by the U.S. authorities and allowed to leave their country.

The questions surrounding the funding and family associations were reputedly one of the reasons the family sold the business to a consortium of investors, including Shay Moran, in the mid 1990s. In the late 1990s, it was announced that the national telephone company, Telecom Éireann, saw an opportunity to enter the ISP market and made an offer for Indigo. This offer was accepted by the then owners/investors, and Indigo was acquired by Telecom Éireann in 1997.

Indigo effectively no longer exists as all of its activities have been subsumed into Eir (formerly Eircom and, before that, Telecom Éireann). The Indigo website now simply points to Eircom services.

<doc id="940626" wikidata="Q2016217" url="?curid=940626" title="Ogoki River">
<text>The Ogoki River is a river in the Thunder Bay and Cochrane Districts of Ontario. It springs from the wilderness just east of Savant Lake, flowing north of Lake Nipigon to Ogoki, where it joins the Albany River which empties into James Bay. The river is long.

The Ogoki River is a narrow, deep, slow-moving, and anastomosing river, with high sediment content. Rapids occur where the river crosses bedrock shelves. The Speckled Trout Rapids, a particularly large set of rapids, is located between Harrogate and Patience Lake. An extensive delta and estuary system has developed where the river enters Ogoki Lake.

The river, now mostly used for canoeing and fishing, was part of a canoe route from Hudson Bay to Lake Superior: via James Bay, Albany River, Ogoki River, portage to Ombabika River, Lake Nipigon, Nipigon River, and finally Lake Superior.

Portions of the river are protected in the Wabakimi Provincial Park and Ogoki River Provincial Park.

==Fauna==
The following fish species have been identified in Ogoki River system:

* walleye
* northern pike
* lake sturgeon
* yellow perch
* lake whitefish
* white sucker
* spottail shiner
* Iowa darter
* Johnny darter
* logperch
* redhorse sucker
* longnose dace
* sculpin
* ninespine stickleback
* burbot
* lake chub
* mimic shiner
* trout-perch
* fathead minnow
* speckled (brook) trout
==Diversion==
In 1943, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario diverted a large part of the upper Ogoki to flow into Lake Nipigon and on to the Great Lakes. This diversion was intended to increase water flow for the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations at Niagara Falls, downstream of Lake Erie.

 of the Ogoki basin is diverted by a high and long dam at the Waboose Falls (also known as Waboose Rapids), constructed in 1940-43. Together with another 3 control dams, this dam raises the water level by about , thereby creating Ogoki Reservoir (which is long and covers an area of approximately ). An average of about is diverted to the headwaters of the Little Jackfish River, a tributary of Lake Nipigon, and leaving about to flow down the Ogoki River itself.

This diversion increases the size of Lake Nipigon&#x27;s watershed by almost 60%, and together with the Long Lake diversion of the Kenogami River, raises Lake Superior by an average of . Although the water levels have improved in the Great Lakes, it has also caused a major drop in water levels and unnatural flooding in the Ogoki River.

==Ogoki River Provincial Park==
The Ogoki River Provincial Park protects a long section of Ogoki River, from Ogoki Reservoir to the Thunder Bay-Cochrane boundary. It also includes Ogoki Lake in its entirety, as well as Kayedon, Harrogate, and Patience Lakes. It was established in 2004 and serves as an important recreational waterway, offering remote tourism and recreation opportunities such as angling, hunting, wildlife viewing, and backcountry canoe camping.

Significant features of the park include a diversity of upland and wetland vegetation, as well as a number of glacial features. It also has a number of plant species that are of regional significance, such as the sandbar willow, along the riverbanks, and the ovate spikerush, found on an Ogoki Lake beach.

It is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no facilities or services. Permitted activities include boating, canoeing, fishing, and hunting.

<doc id="940627" wikidata="Q76360" url="?curid=940627" title="August Wilhelm von Hofmann">
<text>August Wilhelm von Hofmann (8 April 18185 May 1892) was a German chemist who made considerable contributions to organic chemistry. His research on aniline helped lay the basis of the aniline-dye industry, and his research on coal tar laid the groundwork for his student Charles Mansfield&#x27;s practical methods for extracting benzene and toluene and converting them into nitro compounds and amines. Hofmann&#x27;s discoveries include formaldehyde, hydrazobenzene, the isonitriles, and allyl alcohol. He prepared three ethylamines and tetraethylammonium compounds and established their structural relationship to ammonia.

After studying under Justus von Liebig at the University of Giessen, Hofmann became the first director of the Royal College of Chemistry, now part of Imperial College London, in 1845. In 1865 he returned to Germany to accept a position at the University of Berlin as a teacher and researcher. After his return he co-founded the German Chemical Society (&quot;Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft&quot;) (1867).
In both London and Berlin, Hofmann recreated the style of laboratory instruction established by Liebig at Giessen, fostering a school of chemistry focused on experimental organic chemistry and its industrial applications.

Hofmann received several significant awards in the field of chemistry, including the Royal Medal (1854), the Copley Medal (1875) and the Albert Medal (1881). He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1862. He was ennobled on his seventieth birthday. His name is associated with the Hofmann voltameter, the Hofmann rearrangement, the Hofmann–Martius rearrangement, Hofmann elimination, and the Hofmann–Löffler reaction.

== Early life and education ==
August Wilhelm Hofmann was born at Giessen, Grand Duchy of Hesse, on 8 April 1818. He was the son of Johann Philipp Hofmann, privy councillor and provincial architect to the court at Darmstadt. As a young man, he travelled widely with his father. August Wilhelm matriculated at the University of Giessen in 1836.

He originally took up the study of law and philology at Giessen. He may have become interested in chemistry when his father enlarged Liebig&#x27;s Giessen laboratories in 1839. August Wilhelm changed his studies to chemistry, and studied under Justus von Liebig. He obtained his PhD there in 1841. In 1843, after his father&#x27;s death, he became one of Liebig&#x27;s assistants.

His association with Liebig eventually became personal as well as professional. Both his first wife, Helene Moldenhauer (m. 12 August 1846), and his third wife, Elise Moldenhauer (m. 19 May 1866), were nieces of Liebig&#x27;s wife, Henriette Moldenhauer. Hofmann reportedly courted Elise after Liebig&#x27;s daughter Johanna refused him. In between, he married Rosamond Wilson (m. 13 December 1856), and later Bertha Tiemann (m. 11 August 1873) He had eleven children.

==Career==

===Royal College of Chemistry in London===
As president of the Royal Society in London, Albert, Prince Consort to Queen Victoria, was determined to foster scientific advancement in Britain. In 1845, he proposed to start a school of practical chemistry in London, under the style of the Royal College of Chemistry. Liebig was approached for advice, and recommended Hofmann to the directorship of the new institution. Hofmann and the Prince met when Prince Albert, on a visit to his alma mater at Bonn, found his old rooms now occupied by Hofmann and his chemical apparatus. In 1845 Hofmann was approached by Sir James Clark, physician to Queen Victoria with the offer of the directorship. With the support of Prince Albert, and funding from a variety of private sources, the institution opened in 1845 with Hofmann as its first director.

The financial position of the new institution was somewhat precarious. Hofmann accepted the position on the condition that he be appointed as extraordinary professor at Bonn, with leave of absence for two years, so that he could resume his career in Germany if the English appointment did not go well. The college opened in 1845 with 26 students at 16 Hanover Square, moving to cheaper premises at 299 Oxford Street in 1848. Hofmann himself relinquished his free personal accommodation in Hanover Square and gave up part of his salary. Despite this rocky start, the institution became successful for a time, and was an international leader in the development of aniline dyes. Many of the men who studied there made significant contributions to chemical history.

In 1853, the Royal College of Chemistry became part of the governmental Department of Science and Art, under the new School of Mines, putting it in a position to receive governmental funding on a somewhat more secure basis. However, with the death of Prince Albert in 1861, the institution lost one of its most significant supporters. Hofmann felt the loss deeply, writing in 1863, &quot;[Albert&#x27;s] early kindness exercised so powerful an influence upon the destinies of my existence. Year by year do I feel more deeply the debt of gratitude which I owe to him... it is to him, I feel, that I owe my opportunities through life.&quot; Without the Prince&#x27;s encouragement, British government and industry lost interest in science and technology. Hofmann&#x27;s decision to return to Germany can be seen as a symptom of that decline, and with him gone, the Royal College of Chemistry lost its focus. Later, the Royal College of Chemistry, under the School of Mines, became part of Imperial College London as part of a drive to stop Britain falling behind Germany in science and technology.

===Berlin University===
In 1864 Hofmann was offered a chair of chemistry at the University of Bonn, and another at the University of Berlin. While taking his time to decide which offer to accept, Hofmann designed laboratory buildings for both universities, which were both subsequently built. In 1865 he succeeded Eilhard Mitscherlich at the University of Berlin as professor of chemistry and director of the chemical laboratory. He held the position until his death in 1892. Following his return to Germany Hofmann was the principal founder of the German Chemical Society (Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft zu Berlin) (1867) and served 14 terms as its president.

==Contributions==
Hofmann&#x27;s work covered a wide range of organic chemistry.

=== Organic synthesis ===
Hofmann was a major contributor to the development of techniques for organic synthesis, which originated at Liebig&#x27;s laboratory in Giessen. Hofmann and John Blyth were the first to use the term &quot;synthesis&quot;, in their paper &quot;On Styrole, and Some of the Products of Its Decomposition,&quot; predating Kolbe&#x27;s use of the term by some months. What Blyth and Hofmann called &quot;synthesis&quot; enabled them to make inferences about the constitution of styrole. A subsequent paper, Muspratt and Hofmann&#x27;s &quot;On Toluidine&quot;, described some of the first &quot;synthetical experiments&quot; (synthetische Versuche) in the field of organic chemistry.

While the ultimate goal of such experiments was to artificially produce naturally occurring substances, such a goal was not practically attainable at the time. The immediate purpose of the technique was the application of known reactions to a variety of materials to discover what products could be formed. Understanding a substance&#x27;s method of formation was an important step in placing it within a developing taxonomy of substances. This technique became the basis of Hofmann&#x27;s research program. He used organic synthesis as a method of investigation, to increase chemical understanding of reaction products and the processes by which they were formed.

=== Coal tar and anilines ===

Hofmann&#x27;s first research investigations, carried out in Liebig&#x27;s laboratory at Giessen, was an examination of the organic bases of coal tar. Hofmann successfully isolated &quot;Kyanol&quot; and &quot;Leucol&quot;, bases previously reported by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, and showed that &quot;Kyanol&quot; was almost entirely aniline, previously shown to be a decomposition product of the plant dye indigo. In his first publication (1843) he demonstrated that a variety of substances which had been identified in contemporary chemical literature as obtainable from coal tar naphtha and its derivatives were all a single nitrogenous base, aniline. These included &quot;Kyanol&quot;, Carl Julius Fritzsche&#x27;s &quot;Anilin&quot;, Otto Unverdorben&#x27;s &quot;Krystallin&quot;, and Nikolai Zinin&#x27;s &quot;Benzidam&quot;. Much of his subsequent work further developed understanding of the natural alkaloids.

Hofmann drew an analogy between aniline and ammonia. He wanted to convince chemists that organic bases could be described in terms of derivatives of ammonia. Hofmann successfully converted ammonia into ethylamine and the compounds diethylamine, triethylamine, and tetraethylammonium. He was the first chemist to synthesize the quaternary amines. His method of converting an amide into an amine is known as the Hofmann rearrangement.

While primary, secondary, and tertiary amines were stable when distilled at high temperatures under alkaline conditions, the quaternary amine was not. Heating quaternary tetraethylammonium hydroxide yielded tertiary triethylamine vapour. This became the basis of what is now known as the Hofmann elimination, a method for converting quaternary amines into tertiary amines. Hofmann successfully applied the method to coniine, the cholinergic poison of hemlock, to derive the first structure of an alkaloid. His method became extremely significant as a tool for examining the molecular structures of alkaloids, and was eventually applied to morphine, coca amine, atropine, and tubocurarine, among others. Coniine eventually became the first of the alkaloids to be artificially synthesised.

In 1848, Hofmann&#x27;s student Charles Blachford Mansfield developed a method of fractional distillation of coal tar and separated out benzene, xylene, and toluene, an essential step towards the development of products from coal tar.

In 1856, Hofmann&#x27;s student William Henry Perkin was attempting to synthesize quinine at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, when he discovered the first aniline dye, mauveine. The discovery led to the creation of a wide range of artificially created colourful textile dyes, revolutionising the fashion world. Hofmann&#x27;s researches on rosaniline, which he first prepared in 1858, were the beginning of a series of investigations on colouring matter. In 1863, Hofmann showed that aniline blue is a triphenyl derivative of rosaniline and discovered that different alkyl groups could be introduced into the rosaniline molecule to produce dyes of various purple or violet colours, which became known as &#x27;Hofmann&#x27;s violets&#x27;. In 1864, Hofmann confirmed that magenta can only be made by oxidation of commercial aniline in which isomeric orthotoluidine and paratoluidine are present as impurities, not from pure aniline. Other students of Hofmann&#x27;s who became involved in the British dyestuffs industry include Edward Chambers Nicholson, George Maule, and George Simpson. After his return to Germany, Hofmann continued to experiment with dyestuffs, finally creating quinoline red in 1887.

Hofmann studied nitrogen bases, including the development of methods for separating mixtures of amines and the preparation of large numbers of &quot;polyammonias&quot; (diamines and triamines such as ethylenediamine and diethylenediamine). He worked with Auguste Cahours on phosphorus bases between 1855 and 1857. With him, in 1857, Hofmann prepared the first aliphatic unsaturated alcohol, allyl alcohol, C3 H5OH. He also examined its derivative, allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), in 1868, and studied various other isocyanates and isonitriles (isocyanides, or carbylamines).

Hofmann also developed a method for determining the molecular weights of liquids from vapour densities. Hofmann isolated sorbic acid from rowanberries&#x27; oil in 1859, a chemical compound that is widely used as a food preservative.

In 1865, inspired by Auguste Laurent, Hofmann suggested a systematic nomenclature for hydrocarbons and their derivatives. It was adopted internationally by the Geneva Congress, with some modifications, in 1892.

===Molecular models===

Hofmann was apparently the first to introduce molecular models into organic chemistry, following August Kekule&#x27;s introduction of the theory of chemical structure in 1858, and Alexander Crum Brown&#x27;s introduction of printed structural formulas in 1861. At a Friday Evening Discourse at London&#x27;s Royal Institution on April 7, 1865, he displayed molecular models of simple organic substances such as methane, ethane, and methyl chloride, which he had had constructed from differently colored table croquet balls connected together with thin brass tubes. Hofmann&#x27;s original colour scheme (carbon = black, hydrogen = white, nitrogen = blue, oxygen = red, chlorine = green, and sulphur = yellow) has evolved into the CPK colour scheme and is in use even today. After 1874, when van&#x27;t Hoff and Le Bel independently suggested organic molecules can be three-dimensional, molecular models began to assume their modern appearance.

=== Hofmann voltameter ===
The Hofmann voltameter is an apparatus for electrolyzing water, invented by August Wilhelm von Hofmann in 1866. It consists of three joined upright cylinders, usually glass. The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow addition of water and an ionic compound to improve conductivity, such as a small amount of sulphuric acid. A platinum electrode is placed inside the bottom of each of the two side cylinders, connected to the positive and negative terminals of a source of electricity. When current is run through Hofmann&#x27;s Voltameter, gaseous oxygen forms at the anode and gaseous hydrogen at the cathode. Each gas displaces water and collects at the top of the two outer tubes.

==Publications==
Hofmann was multilingual and published extensively, particularly about his work on coal tar and its derivatives. In 1865 Hofmann published &quot;An Introduction to Modern Chemistry&quot;, summarising type theory and emerging ideas about chemical structure. Type theory modelled four inorganic molecules, hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, water, and ammonia, and used them as a basis for systematising and categorising both organic and inorganic compounds by exploring the substitution of one or more atoms of hydrogen for an equivalent atom or group. Hofmann himself had focused on researching ammonia, but discussed all four models in his book. In it, he also first introduced the term valence, under its longer variant quantivalence, to describe the combining capacity of an atom. His textbook strongly influenced introductory textbooks in both Europe and the United States.

In addition to his scientific works, Hofmann wrote biographical notices and essays on the history of chemistry, including a study of Liebig.

== Awards and honours ==
He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1851. He was awarded the society&#x27;s Royal Medal in 1854 and their Copley Medal in 1875 &quot;for his numerous contributions to the science of chemistry, and especially for his researches on the derivatives of ammonia&quot;. On his 70th birthday, in 1888, he was ennobled, enabling him to add the prefix &quot;von&quot; before his last name.

In 1900, the German Chemical Society built the &quot;Hofmann-Haus&quot; at Berlin and in 1902 created the August Wilhelm von Hofmann Gold Medal in his honour, to be awarded for outstanding achievements in chemistry. The first recipients were Sir William Ramsay of England and Professor Henri Moissan of Paris.

==Later life==

Hofmann died in 1892 and was buried in Berlin&#x27;s Friedhof der Dorotheenstädtischen und Friedrichswerderschen Gemeinden.

<text>Oom-pah, Oompah, Ooumpah or Umpapa is an onomatopoeic term describing the rhythmic sound of a deep brass instrument in combination with the response of other instruments or registers in a band, a form of background ostinato.

The oom-pah sound is usually made by the tuba alternating between the root of the chord and the 5th — this sound is said to be the &quot;oom&quot;. The &quot;pah&quot; is played on the off-beats by higher-pitched instruments such as the clarinet, accordion or trombone. Oompah is often associated with &quot;Volkstümliche Musik&quot;, a form of popular German music, and with polka. In triple time genres such as the waltz it is oom-pah-pah.

The musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; contains a song named &quot;Oom-Pah-Pah&quot;, which is named after the oom-pah.

A more modern variation is the playing of contemporary pop and rock songs in an Oompah style, by bands such as Global Kryner (Austria), Oompah Brass (UK) (who dubbed the style &quot;Oompop&quot;), and Brumpah (UK, West Midlands). The American jam band Phish features the oom-pah-pah in their song &quot;Harpua&quot;.

<doc id="940636" wikidata="Q7581717" url="?curid=940636" title="Spybot worm">
<text>The Spybot worm is a large family of computer worms of varying characteristics. Although the actual number of versions is unknown, it is estimated to be well into the thousands. This briefly held the record for most variants, but has subsequently been surpassed by the Agobot family.

==Common features==
Spybot variants generally have several things in common:

* The ability to spread via the P2P program KaZaA, often in addition to other such programs.
* The ability to spread via at least vulnerability in the Windows operating system. Earlier versions mostly used the RPC DCOM buffer overflow, although now some use the LSASS buffer overflow.
* The ability to spread via various common backdoor Trojan horses.
* The ability to spread to systems with weak administrative passwords.

==Recognition==
Because there is no standard of detection nor classification for the Spybot family, there is also no standard naming convention. Because of this lack of standard naming conventions and because of common features, variants of the Spybot worm can often be confused with the Agobot and IRCBot family of worms. Most antivirus programs detect variants generically (e.g. W32/Spybot.worm), and identifying what specific Spybot variant is indicated is next to impossible except with the earliest or most common versions.

As a result of having so many variants, one antivirus company is often not able to recognize and remove all versions of the worm. The same applies to most antispyware software.

==Denial of service attack==
Early detection of the &quot;Spybot worm&quot; usually comes from network engineers detecting the Denial of Service attack generated when the worm tried to communicate back to various IRC channels.

==Underground Uses==
Hackers will occasionally use the worm to make easy-access programs for FTP &amp; IRC channels

<doc id="940638" wikidata="Q1794689" url="?curid=940638" title="Theophilus (crater)">
<text>Theophilus is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies between Sinus Asperitatis in the north and Mare Nectaris to the southeast. It partially intrudes into the comparably sized crater Cyrillus to the southwest. To the east is the smaller crater Mädler and further to the south-southeast is Beaumont. It was named after the 4th-century Coptic Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria.

Theophilus, Cyrillus and Catharina form a prominent group of large craters visible on the terminator 5 days after the new moon.

==Description==
The rim of Theophilus has a wide, d inner surface that shows indications of landslips. It is 4200 metres deep with massive walls and has broken into a second formation, Cyrillus. It was created during the Eratosthenian period, from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago. It has an imposing central mountain, 1,400 metres high, with four summits.

The floor of the crater is relatively flat, and it has a large, triple-peaked central mountain that climbs to a height of about 2 kilometres above the floor. The western peak is designated Psi (ψ), the eastern Phi (φ), and the northern peak is Alpha (α) Theophilus. The western slopes of this ridge are wider and more irregular, whereas the peaks descend more sharply to the floor on the northern and western faces.

The Apollo 16 mission collected several pieces of basalt that are believed to be ejecta from the formation of Theophilus.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Theophilus.

<text>A submarine base is a military base that shelters submarines and their personnel.

Examples of present-day submarine bases include HMNB Clyde, Île Longue (the base for France&#x27;s Force océanique stratégique), Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Naval Submarine Base New London, and Rybachiy Nuclear Submarine Base (near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky).

INS Virbahu, INS Vajrabahu and INS Satavahana are the submarine bases of the Indian Navy. A new underground submarine base, INS Varsha is under construction near Vishakhapatnam for the new expanding fleet of Indian nuclear submarines. 

The Israeli navy bases its growing submarine force in Haifa.

Former submarine bases include DORA 1, , Naval Submarine Base Bangor (now part of Naval Base Kitsap), Mare Island Naval Shipyard (a nuclear-capable base), Ordnance Island in Bermuda during World War II, and the formerly-classified Soviet base at Balaklava in the now Autonomous Republic of Crimea.

The Holland Torpedo Boat Station at hamlet of New Suffolk, New York claims to be the first submarine base in the United States: it served as the base for , a submarine launched in May 1897 and several submarines launched 1901–1903.

However, the United States Navy claims Naval Submarine Base New London was the Navy&#x27;s first submarine base, having been so designated in 1916.

<doc id="940640" wikidata="Q666664" url="?curid=940640" title="Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument">
<text>Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument is a U.S. National Monument located approximately southwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, near Cochiti Pueblo. Managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Cochiti Pueblo tribe, it was established as a national monument by President Bill Clinton in January 2001. Kasha-Katuwe means &quot;white cliffs&quot; in the Pueblo language Keresan. The monument is a unit of the BLM&#x27;s National Conservation Lands.

Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument, a popular recreation area between Santa Fe and Albuquerque, was closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and remained closed until November 2024. To prevent crowding the BLM introduced a reservation system, which will allow about 75,000 visitors annually, a reduction from a peak of 130,000.

==Geology==
Kasha-Katuwe is located on the Pajarito Plateau between 5700 and 6400 feet (1737–1951 m) above sea level. The area owes its remarkable geology to layers of volcanic rock and ash deposited by pyroclastic flow from eruptions within the volcanic field of the Jemez Mountains that occurred 6 to 7 million years ago. These rock layers are assigned to the Peralta Tuff. Many of the layers are light in color, which is the origin of the monument&#x27;s Keresan name. Over time, weathering and erosion of these layers has created slot canyons and tent rocks. The tent rocks are composed of soft pumice and tuff. Most of the tent rocks have a distinctly conical shape and some retain their caprocks of harder stone. The tent rocks vary in height from a few feet to .

==Recreational activities==
The BLM maintains hiking trails as well as parking and restrooms at the site. The Slot Canyon trail is a one-way trail covering through a slot canyon and up a climb of to a lookout point where the tent rocks may be viewed from above. The Cave Loop trail is approximately and leads past the base of the cliffs, near some of the tent rocks and a small cavate similar to those found at the nearby Bandelier National Monument. The Veterans&#x27; Memorial Scenic Overlook, dedicated in 2004, includes a loop trail and views of Peralta Canyon and the Jemez Mountains. The overlook is located at the end of a gravel road approximately west of the tent rocks and may not be accessible depending on road and weather conditions.

The monument is open for day use only and may be closed by order of the Cochiti Pueblo Tribal Governor. Considerations for hiking include the possibility of flash flooding in the slot canyons and the high altitude of the monument. The monument is closed to dogs.

==In popular culture==
The science fiction television series &quot;Earth 2&quot; filmed scenes at the monument.

==Temporary Closure==
The BLM closed the monument in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. BLM planned to update facilities and restore trails, and increased entry fees more in line with the costs to maintain the delicate area. As of 21 November 2024, the monument has reopened.

<text>The paranoiac-critical method is a surrealist technique developed by Salvador Dalí in the early 1930s. He employed it in the production of paintings and other artworks, especially those that involved optical illusions and other multiple images. The technique consists of the artist invoking a paranoid state (fear that the self is being manipulated, targeted or controlled by others). The result is a deconstruction of the psychological concept of identity, such that subjectivity becomes the primary aspect of the artwork.

==Origins==
The surrealists related theories of psychology to the idea of creativity and the production of art. In the mid-1930s André Breton wrote about a &quot;fundamental crisis of the object&quot;. The object began being thought of not as a fixed external object but also as an extension of our subjective self. One of the types of objects theorized in surrealism was the phantom object. According to Salvador Dalí, these objects have a minimum of mechanical meaning, but, when viewed, the mind evokes phantom images which are the result of unconscious acts.

The paranoiac-critical method arose from similar surrealistic experiments with psychology and the creation of images such as Max Ernst&#x27;s frottage or Óscar Domínguez&#x27;s decalcomania, two surrealist techniques, which involved rubbing pencil or chalk on paper over a textured surface and interpreting the phantom images visible in the texture on the paper.

==Description==
The aspect of paranoia that Dalí was interested in and which helped inspire the method was the ability of the brain to perceive links between things which rationally are not linked. Dalí described the paranoiac-critical method as a &quot;spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the critical and systematic objectivity of the associations and interpretations of delirious phenomena&quot;.

Employing the method when creating a work of art uses an active process of the mind to visualize images in the work and incorporate these into the final product. An example of the resulting work is a double image or multiple image in which an ambiguous image can be interpreted in different ways.

André Breton (by way of Guy Mangeot) hailed the method, saying that Dalí&#x27;s paranoiac-critical method was an &quot;instrument of primary importance&quot; and that it &quot;has immediately shown itself capable of being applied equally to painting, poetry, the cinema, the construction of typical Surrealist objects, fashion, sculpture, the history of art, and even, if necessary, all manner of exegesis&quot;.

In his introduction to the 1994 edition of Jacques Lacan&#x27;s &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis&quot;, David Macey stated that &quot;Salvador Dalí&#x27;s theory of &#x27;paranoic knowledge&#x27; is certainly of great relevance to the young Lacan.&quot;

<text>Alina Maratovna Kabaeva or Kabayeva (, ; ; born 12 May 1983) is a Russian politician, media manager, and retired individual rhythmic gymnast, who has been designated Honoured Master of Sports by the Russian government.

Kabaeva is one of the most decorated gymnasts in rhythmic gymnastic history, with 2 Olympic medals, 14 World Championship medals, and 21 European Championship medals. She is reportedly the longtime partner of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

From 2007 to 2014, Kabaeva was a State Duma deputy from United Russia. In September 2014, Kabaeva became the chairwoman of the board of directors of the .

==Early life and family==
Kabaeva was born on 12 May 1983 in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, Soviet Union, the daughter of Lyubov Kabaeva and Marat Kabayev, a professional football player. Her father is a Muslim Tatar and her mother is Russian. Her younger sister, Leysan Kabaeva, is the general director of a real estate agency and in 2016 was appointed as a judge of the Almetyevsk City Court in Tatarstan by Russian president Vladimir Putin. Due to Marat&#x27;s career, the family often travelled to different places in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia.

==Rhythmic gymnastics career==
===Early career===
Kabaeva started rhythmic gymnastics at age three, with coach Margarita Samuilovna. In 1993, she represented Kazakhstan at an international competition in Japan.

In her early teens, Kabaeva moved to Moscow, where her mother took her to the Russian head coach, Irina Viner.

===1996–1999===

Kabaeva stayed with Viner, and made her international debut representing Russia in 1996. The 15-year-old Kabaeva won the 1998 European Championships in Portugal. At the time, she was the youngest member of the Russian squad, competing alongside internationally recognized teammates Amina Zaripova and Yana Batyrshina as well as Irina Tchachina. Kabaeva then became the 1999 European Champion in Hungary, and won the 1999 World Title in Osaka, Japan. Kabaeva went on to win a total of 5 All-Around titles at the European Championships.

At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, in Australia, Kabaeva was expected to claim the gold medal in the all-around; however, due to an error in an otherwise clean performance—she dropped her hoop, and ran to retrieve it outside of the competition area—Kabaeva won the bronze medal, with the final score of 39.466 (Rope 9.925, Hoop 9.641, Ball 9.950, Ribbon 9.950). Belarus&#x27;s Yulia Raskina took the silver medal, while fellow Russian teammate, Yulia Barsukova, won the Olympic gold medal.

===2001–2004===
At the 2001 World Championships in Madrid, Spain, Kabaeva won the gold medal for the Ball, Clubs, Hoop, Rope, the Individual All-Around, and the Team competitions. At the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane, Australia, Kabaeva won the gold medal for the Ball, Clubs, and Rope competitions, and the Silver in the Individual All-Around, and Hoop. However, Kabaeva and her teammate, Irina Tchachina, tested positive to a banned diuretic (furosemide), and were stripped of their medals.

Viner, the Russian head coach, who also served as the Vice President of the FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee at the time, said her gymnasts had been taking a food supplement called &quot;Hyper&quot;, that contained mild diuretics, which, according to Viner, the gymnasts were taking for premenstrual syndrome. When the supply ran out shortly before the Goodwill Games, the team physiotherapist restocked at a local pharmacy. According to Viner, the supplement sold there was fake and contained furosemide. The Committee requested that the Goodwill Games Organizing Committee nullify Kabaeva and Tchachina&#x27;s results. The FIG also nullified their results from the World Championships in Madrid, causing Ukraine&#x27;s Tamara Yerofeeva to be declared the 2001 world champion. Kabaeva was not allowed to participate in competitions from August 2001 to August 2002. Her first international competition after the ban was the 2002 European Championships, where she took first place in the individual all-around.

Kabaeva gained the 2003 World Title in Budapest, Hungary. Kabaeva won the All-Around Gold Medal at the 2003 World Championships, as well as the event final in Ribbon and Ball ahead of Anna Bessonova from Ukraine.

In 2004, Kabaeva won the All-Around Gold at the 2004 European Championships in Kyiv, Ukraine. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, Greece, Kabaeva won the gold medal in the Individual All-Around for Rhythmic Gymnastics, with a score of 108.400 (Hoop 26.800, Ball 27.350, Clubs 27.150, Ribbon 27.100), the Silver Medal went to her teammate, Irina Tchachina.

===2005–2007===

In October 2004, Kabaeva announced her retirement from the sport. However, in June 2005, the Russian Head Coach Irina Viner announced a possible comeback. Kabaeva resumed her sport career at an Italy-Russia friendly competition in Genoa, on 10 September 2005. On 5 March 2006, Kabaeva won the Gazprom Moscow Grand Prix, with fellow Russians Vera Sessina and Olga Kapranova, taking the Second and Third places. Kabaeva won the silver medal in All-Around at the 2006 European Championships, behind teammate, Sessina.

At the 2007 European Championships in Baku, Azerbaijan; Kabaeva, Sessina, and Kapranova were chosen to represent Russia. However, on the eve of the competition, Kabaeva withdrew due to an injury. Viner selected rising upcoming gymnast Evgenia Kanaeva from Russia&#x27;s National Team as the replacement. Kabaeva finished fourth in all-around qualifications at the 2007 World Championships but did not advance into the finals due to the two per country rule, with Vera Sessina and Olga Kapranova placing ahead of her. Kabaeva did qualify for the ribbon final where she won a bronze medal behind Sessina and Ukraine&#x27;s Anna Bessonova.

=== 2008 Beijing Olympics ===
The plans for Kabaeva&#x27;s participation in the 2008 Olympics were repeatedly announced, but this did not happen.

=== Doping scandal ===
In 2001, Kabaeva and Irina Chashchina were convicted of using furosemide, as a result of which both were disqualified for two years. The athletes were stripped of all the awards of the 2001 Goodwill Games and World Cup. From August 2001 to August 2002, these gymnasts were not allowed to take part in any competitions. The second year of disqualification was given conditionally; that is, they were allowed to compete in official tournaments, but the strictest control was established over them.

===Contributions to rhythmic gymnastics===
Kabaeva revolutionized rhythmic gymnastics as one of the few gymnasts to have performed new skills and elements, including the back split pivot with hand help (also known as &quot;The Kabaeva&quot;), the ring position with a slow full turn, and the backscale pivot that she first performed.

===Rhythmic gymnastic achievements===

* Leveled with Elena Karpukhina as one of the youngest Rhythmic Gymnast to win the All-Around World Championships in 1999 Osaka at 16 years old, until Yana Kudryavtseva of the Russian Federation broke the record winning the All-Around 2013 World Championships at 15 years old.
* Performed the backscale pivot first.
* Holds the record for the most European All-Around titles, in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2004.

* Became a six time Russian National All-Around Champion, in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007.

===Detailed Olympic results===

===Routine music information===
===Post-retirement===
Kabaeva was among the six Russian athlete torch bearers who carried the Olympic flame through Fisht Stadium during the Opening Ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Her selection as a torch bearer generated controversy in the international media because of her alleged close relationship with President Vladimir Putin.

In 2015, Kabaeva was an honorary guest at the 2015 World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. In 2017, she became the official FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Ambassador at the 2017 World Championships in Pesaro, Italy.

==Political and media careers==
Since 2005, Kabaeva has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. Since February 2008, she has been chairwoman of the Public Council of the , the media group that controls Izvestia, Channel One and REN TV.

Between 2007 and 2014, Kabaeva was a Member of the Russian Parliament, the State Duma, representing Nizhnekamsk as a member of the United Russia party. In her capacity as a Member of Parliament, she voted for a number of controversial laws that were speedily adopted in 2012 and 2013, including the Anti-Magnitsky bill banning inter-country adoption (of Russian orphans) by families in the United States, as well as the Russian gay propaganda law making the distribution of &quot;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships&quot; among minors a punishable offense, the extrajudicial ban on access to websites which may host materials violating copyright laws, and the reorganization of the Academy of Sciences.

In September 2014, Kabaeva resigned from the Duma and accepted the position of chair of the board of directors of the National Media Group, the largest Russian media conglomerate. She has faced criticism for her lack of experience and high salary when appointed to political and media posts.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center of the Central European University evaluated the National Media Group to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==Other ventures==
In 2001, Kabaeva appeared in the Japanese movie, &quot;Red Shadow&quot;, performing a gymnastics routine.

In January 2011, Kabaeva appeared on the cover of &quot;Vogue Russia&quot;. In the same month, she launched her singing career, taking to the stage for the first time.

==Sanctions==
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, sanctions were imposed on numerous Russian political and business leaders. In April 2022, the United States Department of the Treasury prepared sanctions against Kabaeva, however the United States government withheld the sanctions for fear of escalating tensions between Russia and the United States due to her alleged relationship with Putin. The Office of Foreign Assets Control added Kabaeva to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List on 3 August 2022, which results in her assets being frozen and U.S. persons being prohibited from dealing with her.

On 13 May 2022, Kabaeva and her grandmother Anna Zatseplina were sanctioned by the United Kingdom. On 27 May, Canada imposed sanctions on Kabaeva. On 3 June, she was sanctioned by the European Union. On 1 July, she was sanctioned by Australia.

==Personal life==
In April 2008, the &quot;Moskovsky Korrespondent&quot; reported that Kabaeva was engaged to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The story was denied and the newspaper was shut down. In the following years, the status of Kabaeva and Putin&#x27;s relationship became a topic of speculation, including allegations that they have multiple children together.

In July 2013, Kabaeva said that she did not have children. In March 2015, she was reported to have given birth to a daughter at the VIP hospital of Saint Ann in Ticino, Switzerland. In 2019, she reportedly gave birth to twin sons at the Kulakov maternity clinic in Moscow. However, the Swiss newspaper &quot;SonntagsZeitung&quot; reported in 2022 that a Swiss gynecologist of Russian origin assisted at both births, stating that the first in 2015 was of a boy and the second in 2019 of another boy, and that both were Putin&#x27;s sons.

According to United States and European security officials, Kabaeva has spent long periods of time in Switzerland since 2015, at residences in Lugano and Cologny.

<text>Ireland On-Line (IOL) is a former ISP in Ireland.

Ireland On-line was the first commercial internet service provider in the state. The company was formed in 1992 by Barry Flanagan, and was reported to have launched &quot;Ireland&#x27;s first mass-market Internet service&quot; in January 1994. In 1997, the company was bought by An Post for IR£2.5m. Two years later, it was sold to Esat Telecom Group plc for IR£ 115m. A year later, Esat Telecom was taken over by BT Group plc. In 2002 Esat was rebranded Esat BT. In 2009 BT Ireland withdrew from retail telecommunications and transferred retail operations, along with IOL&#x27;s former subscribers, to Vodafone Ireland.

<text>Cornelis &quot;Kees&quot; van Geelkerken (; 19 March 1901 – 29 March 1976) was a Dutch fascist political leader and Nazi collaborator. 

Van Geelkerken was born in 1901 to a Dutch family in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, Belgium, and grew up in Utrecht. He gravitated toward fascism in the 1920s while working as a municipal employee in Zeist and Utrecht. Van Geelkerken co-founded the far-right National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) with Anton Mussert in 1931. He was made the leader of the &quot;Nationale Jeugdstorm&quot;, the party&#x27;s youth corps.

In 1943, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, Van Geelkerken was appointed Inspector-General of the &quot;Nederlandse Landwacht&quot;, a collaborationist paramilitary created by the Germans to combat the Dutch resistance. He was expelled from the NSB in early 1945 after a falling out with Mussert. After the war, he was tried in the &quot;Bijzonder Gerechtshof&quot; (&quot;Special Court of Justice&quot;) and sentenced to life imprisonment. Geelkerken was released from prison in 1959 and died in 1976 in Ede.

<doc id="940668" wikidata="Q39005" url="?curid=940668" title="The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)">
<text>The Pleasure Garden is a 1926 British–German silent drama film directed by Alfred Hitchcock in his feature film directorial debut. Based on the 1923 novel of the same name by Oliver Sandys, the film is about two chorus girls at the Pleasure Garden Theatre in London and their troubled relationships.

==Plot==
Jill, a young dancer, arrives in London with a letter of introduction to Mr. Hamilton, proprietor of the Pleasure Garden Theatre. The letter and all her money are stolen from her handbag as she waits to see him. Patsy, a chorus girl at the Pleasure Garden, sees her difficulty and offers to take her to her own lodgings and to try to get her a job. Next morning Jill is successful in getting a part in the show. Her fiancé, Hugh, arrives with a colleague called Levet. Hugh and Patsy become very close while Jill is being pursued by a number of rich men, eventually breaking up with Hugh in order to begin a relationship with the wealthy Prince Ivan. Not long after this, Hugh is sent to Africa by his company.

Jill moves out of the lodgings she shares with Patsy and becomes more involved with the Prince. As she becomes more successful and used to the rich and famous lifestyle she also becomes more dismissive of Patsy, shunning her and eventually seeing her as a commoner. As Patsy laments the loss of her friend, she is comforted by Levet who convinces her to enter into marriage with him. The couple honeymoon in Italy before he leaves to join Hugh in Africa. After some time Patsy finally receives a letter from her husband in which he says he has been sick for weeks. Patsy is determined to go to take care of him and asks Jill to lend her the fare. Jill refuses as she is preparing for her marriage to the Prince and has no money to spare. Patsy is able to borrow the fare from her landlords Mr and Mrs Sidey. When she arrives at her husband&#x27;s bungalow, she finds that he is having an affair with a local woman and leaves. Levet tries to drive the woman away but when she refuses to leave him, follows her into the sea and drowns her.

Meanwhile, Patsy has found that Hugh really is very ill with a fever and stays to take care of him. Hugh has since discovered from a newspaper that Jill is to marry the Prince and he and Patsy soon realize that they love each other. Levet finds them together and accuses Hugh of making advances to his wife. Patsy agrees to follow Levet back to his bungalow in order to save Hugh. During the night, Levet is stricken with guilt and paranoia over the murder of his mistress and begins seeing ghostly visions of her. Levet becomes convinced that the ghost of his mistress will not stop haunting him until he murders Patsy too. Levet corners Patsy with a sword but he is shot dead before he can kill her. Hugh and Patsy find consolation with each other and return to London.

==Cast==
* Virginia Valli as Patsy Brand
* Carmelita Geraghty as Jill Cheyne
* Miles Mander as Levet
* John Stuart as Hugh Fielding
* Ferdinand Martini as Mr. Sidey
* Florence Helminger as Mrs. Sidey
* Georg H. Schnell as Oscar Hamilton
* Karl Falkenberg as Prince Ivan
* Elizabeth Pappritz as Native Girl (uncredited)
* Louis Brody as Plantation Manager (uncredited)

==Production==
Hitchcock described the casting process thus:
Producer Michael Balcon allowed Hitchcock to direct the film when Graham Cutts, a jealous executive at Gainsborough Pictures, refused to let Hitchcock work on &quot;The Rat&quot;.

The film was shot in Italy (Alassio, Genoa, and Lake Como) and Germany. Many misfortunes befell the cast and crew. When Gaetano Ventimiglia, the film&#x27;s cinematographer, failed to declare the film stock to Italian customs officials, the team had to pay fines and buy new film, seriously depleting their budget.

For the only time in a British Hitchcock production, both lead actresses, Virginia Valli and Carmelita Geraghty, were American.

The film was shot in 1925 and shown briefly in London in April 1926. However, it was not officially released in the UK until January 1927, just before Hitchcock&#x27;s third film, &quot;The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog&quot;, became a hit in February 1927.

===Production credits===
The production credits on the film were as follows:
* Director – Alfred Hitchcock 
* Producer – Michael Balcon 
* Writing – Eliot Stannard (screenplay), Oliver Sandys (underlying novel)
* Assistant director – Alma Reville

==Reception==
A review in an American film magazine called &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; a &quot;sex picture wholely unsuitable for the exhibitor who aims to show good clean entertainment&quot; with &quot;many highly objectionable scenes&quot;, making it &quot;not a picture to entertain American audiences&quot;.

==Preservation status and home media==
In June 2012, &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; and eight other silent Hitchcock films were restored by the British Film Institute. As a result, 20 minutes of missing footage was added to this film, including &quot;the atmospheric color tinting of the period&quot;. A new score was commissioned for the restoration by young British composer Daniel Patrick Cohen and it has been performed live with the film many times around the world. It has not been released on home video due to a lack of funds to properly record the score.

The only official DVD release contains a poor quality edited version of the film by US collector Raymond Rohauer.&quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; has been heavily bootlegged on home video. At the end of 2021, &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; became the first Hitchcock film to enter the public domain in the United States.

==Significance==
According to critic Dave Kehr, &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot;&#x27;s opening scene stands like a virtual &quot;clip reel of Hitchcock motifs to come&quot;. The first shot captures chorus girls descending a spiral staircase (see &quot;Vertigo&quot;); a man uses opera glasses to better appreciate a blonde chorus dancer (see &quot;Rear Window&quot;); and the same blonde, who at first appears erotically remote, later emerges as down-to-earth and approachable (see &quot;Family Plot&quot;).

<doc id="940669" wikidata="Q3504854" url="?curid=940669" title="Agobot">
<text>Agobot, also frequently known as Gaobot, is a family of computer worms. Axel &quot;Ago&quot; Gembe, a German programmer also known for leaking Half-Life 2 a year before release, was responsible for writing the first version.
The Agobot source code describes it as: “a modular IRC bot for Win32 / Linux”. Agobot was released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Agobot is a multi-threaded and mostly object oriented program written in C++ as well as a small amount of assembly. Agobot is an example of a Botnet that requires little or no programming knowledge to use.

==Technical details==
New versions, or variants, of the worm appeared so rapidly that the Agobot family quickly grew larger than other bot families. Other bots in the Agobot family include Phatbot and Forbot. Agobot now has several thousand known variants. The majority of these target the Microsoft Windows platform; as a result the vast majority of the variants are not Linux compatible. Modern Agobot strains were most likely built with Visual Studio due to their reliance on Visual Studio&#x27;s SDK and Processor Pack. An infectious Agobot can vary in size but is typically around 12 to 500 kilobytes depending on features, compiler optimizations, and binary modifications. 

A module written for one member in the Agobot family can usually be ported with ease to another bot. This mix-matching of modules to suit the owner&#x27;s needs has inspired many of the worm&#x27;s variants. 

Most Agobots have the following features:
* Password Protected IRC Client control interface 
* Remotely update and remove the installed bot 
* Execute programs and commands
* Port scanner used to find and infect other hosts
* DDoS attacks used to takedown networks

The Agobot may contain other features such as:
* Packet sniffer
* Keylogger
* Polymorphic code
* Rootkit installer
* Information harvest
** Email Addresses
** Software Product Keys
** Passwords
* SMTP Client
** Spam
** Spreading copies of itself
* HTTP client 
** Click Fraud
**DDoS Attacks

==Spreading==
The following propagation methods are sub-modules to the port scanning engine:
* MS03-026 RPC DCOM Remote Buffer Overflow (CVE-2003-0352)
* MS04-011 LSASS Remote Buffer Overflow (CVE-2003-0533)
* MS05-039 Plug and Play Remote Buffer Overflow (CVE-2005-1983)
* Attempts to hijack common Trojan horses that accept incoming connections via an open port. 
* The ability to spread to systems by brute forcing a login. A good example is Telnet or Microsoft&#x27;s Server Message Block

Generally, it has been observed that every custom modified variant of Agobot features a selection of the above methods as well as some &quot;homebrew&quot; modules, which essentially are released exploits ported to its code.

Names and such can be added via the XML files to produce variable shuffle imports.

== Variants ==

===Gaobot.ee===
Gaobot.ee is a variant of Agobot. It is also known as the W32.HLLW.Gaobot.EE. It is a malicious computer worm that tends to come from the P2P network Ares, installing from its virus form, &quot;Ares.exe&quot;. It has rather odd characteristics for a virus, with the unique ability to download and install random files (perhaps to create more sharers) from its members, such as music, pornography, and even full games. Gaobot.ee is a worm that sends large numbers of unsolicited e-mails using its own SMTP engine. This worm also opens a backdoor on a random TCP port, notifies attackers through a predetermined IRC channel, and attempts to terminate various security products and system monitoring tools.

Its security level is low, hardly doing any damage to a computer. However, it has been reported to download and install spyware, more viruses, trojans, and worms, although this is not as yet officially been proven.

<text>A field lacrosse game was played between Canada and Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The game was tied 9-9 in the fourth period, before Canada scored 5 straight goals to pull ahead. Canada won 14-10 to earn their second of two gold medals, the only lacrosse gold medals given out in the Olympic Games.

==Background==

The game marked the second appearance of lacrosse at the Olympics, the first being at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Only two teams competed — one fewer than in 1904. South Africa was slated to send a team but then withdrew prior to the tournament.

Both teams held try-outs to select the players to represent their country. The Official Report notes that it was the &quot;first time in the history of Canadian lacrosse a team had been selected from all parts of the Dominion,&quot; with players from clubs &quot;as far apart as New Westminster and Montreal.&quot; The report also credits the British team as &quot;by far the strongest ever put into the field&quot; by England, though admits the sport was &quot;not yet as well-known as it ought to be on this side of the Atlantic.&quot;

<doc id="940683" wikidata="Q31657" url="?curid=940683" title="United Team of Germany at the Olympics">
<text>The United Team of Germany () was a combined team of athletes from West Germany and East Germany that competed in the 1956, 1960 and 1964 Winter and Summer Olympic Games. In 1956, the team also included athletes from a third Olympic body, the Saarland Olympic Committee, which had sent a separate team in 1952, but in 1956 was in the process of joining the German National Olympic Committee. This process was completed in February 1957 after the admission of Saarland into West Germany.

== History ==

As East Germany had introduced its own national anthem in 1949, Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 melody to Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Ode an die Freude&quot; (&quot;Ode to Joy&quot;) was played for winning German athletes as a compromise. In 1959, East Germany also introduced an altered black-red-gold tricolour flag of Germany as the flag of East Germany. Thus, a compromise had to be made also for the flag of the unified sports team. It was agreed upon to superimpose the plain flag with additional white Olympic rings. This flag was used from 1960 to 1968.

At the Games of 1956, 1960 and 1964 the team was simply known as &quot;Germany&quot; and the usual country code of GER was used, except at Innsbruck in 1964, when the Austrian hosts used the German language &quot;D&quot; for Deutschland.
Yet, the IOC code EUA (from the official French International Olympic Committee (IOC) designation &quot;Équipe Unifiée d&#x27;Allemagne&quot;) is currently applied retrospectively in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

In the 1968 Winter Olympics, East and West German athletes competed as separate teams while still using the compromise Olympic flag and Beethoven anthem. While today listed under the IOC codes of FRG (West) and GDR (East), respectively, in 1968 they were asymmetrically called in French &quot;Allemagne&quot; (Germany) and &quot;Allemagne de l&#x27;Est&quot; (East Germany), and in Spanish &quot;Alemania&quot; and &quot;Alemania del Este&quot;. The codes for Germany (West) were ALL (in Grenoble) and ALE (in Mexico City), and ADE for East Germany. Despite using the same flag as each other, the two delegations did not march as one team in the Parade of Nations (unlike, for example, North and South Korea at the 2000 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations) and each bore a separate instance of the compromise flag. Due to the naming, the two teams marched adjacently.

The separation was completed at the 1972 Winter Olympics with the use of separate flags and anthems. While East Germany would march under their official name &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; from then onward, West Germany would continue to march under the name &quot;Germany&quot; in 1972 and 1976, switching to their official name &quot;Federal Republic of Germany&quot; from 1980 onward. As a result, the two countries would march adjacent to each other during the 1972 Winter Olympics (in English alphabetical order) and the 1976 Winter Olympics (in German). However, the two countries did not march adjacently during the 1972 Summer Olympics (because West Germany marched last as host) or the 1976 Summer Olympics (due to French order &quot;Allemagne&quot; and &quot;République Démocratique Allemande&quot;). By coincidence, the two countries would march adjacently one last time during the 1988 Summer Olympics, due to Korean alphabetical order. East Germany ceased to exist in 1990, when its five states, together with Berlin, joined West Germany in German reunification.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Joseph Dieudonné Boussingault (2 February 1801 – 11 May 1887) was a French chemist who made significant contributions to agricultural science, petroleum science and metallurgy.

==Biography==
Jean-Baptiste Boussingault – an agricultural scientist and chemist – was born in Paris. After studying at the school of mines at Saint-Etienne he went to Alsace to work in the asphalt mines – a two-year interlude that was to shape his contributions to science.

During the insurrection of the Spanish colonies, the president of Gran-Colombia, the liberator Simón Bolívar, named Francisco Antonio Zea, ambassador in France, to contract youngers and singles European scientists to investigate the available sources of his new formed nation. In 1822 Boussingault with the Peruvian geologist Mariano Rivero were contracted by Zea and they went to Venezuela as a mining engineer on behalf of an English company contracted by Bolivar. In Urao lagoon near Lagunillas, Merida State, Venezuela discovered the mineral Gaylussite. During his stay in America, he observed that goiter was endemic in some areas and not in others, and that this was related to the presence of iodine in the salt of some salt flats. Consequently, on his return to Europe, he proposed the use of this iodized salt to combat goiter, although his proposal was not taken into account.

At Santa Fe de Bogota he was attached to the staff of General Bolivar as colonel and traveled widely in the northern parts of the continent. Between March and December 1831, he attempted to climb seven Andean volcanoes: Puracé, Pasto and Cumbal in Colombia, and Pichincha, Antisana, Cotopaxi and Chimborazo in Ecuador. In 1831 he climbed to a new highest altitude by a Western explorer on Chimborazo (6.006 m) in the process.
Returning to France in 1832 he married Adele Le Bel whose family had the concession to the asphalt mines where he had previously worked and it was in this period that he made his greatest discoveries. Later he became professor of chemistry at Lyon, and in 1839 was appointed to the chair of agricultural and analytical chemistry at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers in Paris. In 1848 he was elected to the National Assembly representing his adopted Alsace, where he sat as a Moderate republican. Three years later he was dismissed from his professorship on account of his political opinions, but so much resentment at this action was shown by scientific men in general, and especially by his colleagues, who threatened to resign in a body, that he was reinstated. He died in Paris.

His first papers were concerned with agricultural and mining topics, and his sojourn in South America yielded a number of miscellaneous memoirs, on the cause of goitre in the Cordilleras, the gases of volcanoes, earthquakes, tropical rain, &amp;c., which won the commendation of Alexander von Humboldt. From 1836 he devoted himself mainly to agricultural chemistry and animal and vegetable physiology, with occasional excursions into mineral chemistry. His work included papers on the quantity of nitrogen in different foods, the amount of gluten in different wheats, investigations on the question whether plants can assimilate free nitrogen from the atmosphere (which he answered in the negative and propose the basis of what became known as the nitrogen cycle), the respiration of plants, the function of their leaves, the action and value of manures and chemical fertilizers, and other similar subjects. In 1839, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Through his wife Adele Le Bel he had a share in an estate at Pechelbronn in Alsace, where he carried out many agricultural experiments on what is considered to be the first agricultural experimental station (as defined in terms of scientific experimentation on a field basis). He collaborated with Jean Baptiste Dumas in writing an (1841), and was the author of (1844), which was remodelled as (5 vols., 1860–1874; 2nd ed., 1884), and of (1875).

Boussingault established the first agricultural experiment station on his wife&#x27;s property in Pechelbronn in Alsace, France some 60 km north of Strasbourg, France in 1836. Rothamsted in the UK, generally considered the longest continuous experimental station was started some seven years later in 1843, and the German equivalent in Moeckern in 1852. As he was a chemist, which was at that time a rapidly expanding field, and as the application of such science to agriculture was overdue, it is logical that many of Boussingault&#x27;s contributions from his work related to soil chemical and plant nutritional knowledge.
His experimental station did not survive him, or rather could not withstand the vacillations of the 1870 Franco-Prussian war despite some revealing respect for intellectual works in WWII anecdotes, but his discoveries were built on by others, including his better known contemporary, Liebig – who loudly acknowledged Boussingault as the pioneer and great discover of many advances in soil and plant chemistry.

The site of his, the world&#x27;s first agricultural experimental station, is today a grand Alsatian grange and outbuilding complex in northeastern France in urgent need of restoration (see photo). As of April 2011, an explanatory panel explaining his work has been erected (see photo) correcting some earlier misunderstanding that his experimental work was conducted at another site in the town of Pechelbronn where he maintained a house. The confusion is understandable as the history of the area is dominated by the petroleum technologies developed in that industry, and to which Boussingault contributed as part of his employment in the region. The shadow cast over his work by this more popular subject has led to his status being neglected beyond a cadre of informed scientists and scientific historians.

==Scientific discoveries==
Boussingault re-introduced the quantitative methods first employed by de Saussure and is credited with the following discoveries related to agriculture:
#the first analysis of crops grown in a rotation
#the increase in soil nitrogen following the growth of legume crops
#the theory (later confirmed by Persoz) that the carbohydrate fraction of a food ration is metabolized to fat in herbivores
#plant growth is proportional to the amount of available assimilatory nitrogen, which in practical terms allows greater plant growth from the simultaneous application of phosphorus and nitrogen
#definition of the photosynthetic quotient.

==Modern tribute to Boussingault==
Sometimes scientists are more remembered for their less significant discoveries. Most popular literature lists Boussingault as a contributor to the petroleum development of Alsace, and as being one of the few outsiders who married into the industrialist Le Bel family to be accepted by them in the long term. The mineral Boussingaultite is named after him.

Boussingault&#x27;s most important work was his contribution to agricultural chemistry. His works and experiments contributed to an understanding of the critical role of nitrogen in plant growth and ecological systems. This understanding made possible further developments in nitrogen harnessing and fertilization, unforeseeable in Boussingault&#x27;s day. These developments, such as the Haber–Bosch process, eventually resulted in nitrogen fertilizers and related products. Nitrogen fertilizers are a critical component of the modern agricultural industry, and have prevented major food shortages up to the present day.

==Memoirs==
Boussingault left several volumes of memoirs, which range in subject matter from his very diverse scientific inquiries to his more colorful personal adventures, notably with Bolivar and others in South America.

<text>Trouvelot is a lunar impact crater located to the south of the Mare Frigoris. It was named after the French astronomer Étienne Trouvelot. It is a bowl-shaped formation with a higher albedo than its surroundings. The rim is roughly circular, but somewhat uneven. It has not been significantly eroded by subsequent impacts. The crater lies less than 10 kilometers to the south of the Vallis Alpes canyon formation.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Trouvelot.

<text>Vladimir III Mstislavich (1132–1171) was a prince of Dorogobuzh (1150–1154; 1170–1171), Vladimir and Volyn (1154–1157), Slutsk (1162), Trypillia (1162–1168) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1171). He was the son of Mstislav I Vladimirovich. Vladimir was the grandson of Vladimir Monomakh.

==Biography==
Due to his brief rule, he is omitted from some lists of the princes of Kiev. The chronology provided in the &quot;Hypatian&quot; and &quot;Khlebnikov&quot; copies of the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; show various errors, and also contradict each other. According to historian Leonid Makhnovets (1989), his reign should be dated from 5 February to 10 May 1171, three months and a few days, even though the text says &quot;four months&quot; (because incomplete periods of time were customarily rounded up).

==Private life==
Vladimir was a son of Mstislav I from his second marriage with Liubava Dmitrievna Zavidich. According to &quot;Latopis kijowski&quot; Vladimir was born between 1 March 1131 and 29 February 1132.
He kept excellent ties with Hungary and Serbia. In 1150 he married the daughter of Serbia&#x27;s Beloš Vukanović. According to old Russian annals, her titular name was inscribed as &quot;Banovna&quot;. They had four sons.

<doc id="940725" wikidata="Q17033570" url="?curid=940725" title="Wartime Elections Act">
<text>The Canadian Wartime Elections Act () was a bill passed on September 20, 1917, by the Conservative government of Robert Borden during the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and was instrumental in pushing Liberals to join the Conservatives in the formation of the Canadian Unionist government. While the bill was an explicit attempt to get more votes for the government, it was also the first act giving women the vote in federal elections.

The Act gave the vote to the wives, widows, mothers, and sisters of soldiers serving overseas. They were the first women ever to be able to vote in Canadian federal elections and were also a group that was strongly in favour of conscription. The act also disenfranchised &quot;enemy-alien&quot; citizens naturalized after March 31, 1902 (unless they had relatives serving in the armed forces); this meaning primarily German, Ukrainian, and Polish Canadians (former subjects of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires). Doukhobors, only in British Columbia, were partially disenfranchised for 37 years — 1919 to 1956 — first in provincial and then in 1934 in federal elections, but not in municipal or school board elections, because politicians feared their leader could dictate them to vote &quot;en bloc&quot; to influence an election. At the time the act was passed, it was justified through the patriotic fever surrounding World War I. While it was opposed by those who were disenfranchised and other opponents of the government, it was widely supported by the majority of Canadians.

The act was coupled with the &quot;Military Voters Act&quot; that further skewed the vote in favour of the Unionists. The two laws were effective in helping the government be re-elected in the 1917 election, but the Unionists were elected by a large enough margin that they would have won anyway. In the long run, however, the laws so alienated French-Canadians and recent immigrants that they would vote Liberal for decades, greatly hurting the Conservative Party.

After the war, the Act was repealed by the Dominion Elections Act of 1920, which was enacted on June 29 and assented to on July 1, 1920. Most women (notably not Aboriginal women or those without property) were enfranchised as of 24 May 1918.

<doc id="940738" wikidata="Q821761" url="?curid=940738" title="Estádio do Morumbi">
<text>The Estádio Cícero Pompeu de Toledo, popularly known as Estádio do Morumbi (Morumbi Stadium), and currently known as MorumBIS for sponsorship reasons, is a multipurpose 72,039-seater football stadium located in the eponymous district in São Paulo, Brazil. It is the home of São Paulo and its formal name honors Cícero Pompeu de Toledo, who was São Paulo Futebol Clube&#x27;s chairman during most of the stadium construction and died before its inauguration. Morumbi is the largest privately owned stadium in Brazil. Designed by the architect João Batista Vilanova Artigas., the stadium is a monument of brazilian modernism and in 2018 was formally marked as a cultural building by São Paulo’s prefecture.

== History ==

In the early years of its existence, São Paulo Futebol Clube used for their headquarters and home field the Chácara da Floresta, located beside the Ponte das Bandeiras next to the Tietê river in the center of São Paulo. For this reason, the first incarnation of the club, that existed from 1930 to 1935, is referred to as &quot;São Paulo da Floresta&quot;.

When the club was refounded in December 1935, since the Chácara da Floresta now belonged to Clube de Regatas Tietê, which had absorbed the original São Paulo Futebol Clube, the refounded São Paulo didn&#x27;t have its own field. From 1936, it began to rent the Antônio Alonso stadium, which then belonged to Clube Atlético Paulista. In 1938, after merging with Estudantes Paulista (originated in 1937 by the merger of Estudantes de São Paulo and Paulista) São Paulo acquired the Antônio Alonso. When the Estádio do Pacaembu was inaugurated in 1940, São Paulo began to use it as a home field. the Antônio Alonso stadium was sold to Juventus in 1942.

In 1944, São Paulo bought a piece of ground called Canindé, which was only used as a headquarters and training location. The area was too small for the construction of a large stadium, so studies were done to find another home within the city of São Paulo.

In 1952, São Paulo&#x27;s chairman Cícero Pompeu de Toledo requested from the city&#x27;s mayor, Armando de Arruda Pereira, a groundplot in the Ibirapuera neighborhood. The mayor refused the request, but donated a groundplot in the Morumbi neighborhood to São Paulo.

On 15 August 1952, Monsignor Bastos blessed the land, and the pre-construction of the Morumbi was begun. A committee to oversee its construction was elected, and consisted of: Cícero Pompeu de Toledo (president); Piragibe Nogueira (Vice President); Cássio Luís dos Santos (Secretary); Amador Aguiar (Treasurer); Altino de Castro Lima, Carlos Alberto Gomes Cardim, Luis Campos Aranha, Manoel Raymundo Paes de Almeida; Osvaldo Artur Bratke, Roberto Gomes Pedrosa, Roberto Barros Lima, Marcos Gasparian, Paulo Machado de Carvalho; and Pedro Pinto Filho.

Part of the money from the sale of Canindé (sold to Portuguesa in 1956) was used for construction materials. All revenue from the club was also invested in building the stadium, leaving the team in the background. The actual construction of the new stadium began in 1953. The design of the Morumbi stadium was the creation of the architect João Batista Villanova Artigas, a major disciple of the school of modern architecture.

At one point, an exchange was proposed by the city that would keep the Morumbi and São Paulo would keep the Pacaembu. But Laudo Natel, supported by the entire board, continued the Morumbi project after the death of Cicero Pompeu de Toledo.

On 15 August 1952, the stadium construction started. Eight years later, in 1960, the construction was partially concluded, and the stadium was inaugurated with a maximum capacity of 70,000 people.

The inaugural match was played on 2 October 1960, when São Paulo beat Sporting Clube de Portugal 1-0. The first goal in the stadium was scored by São Paulo&#x27;s Peixinho.

In 1970, the stadium construction was finally concluded, and the stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity was increased to 140,000 people. The re-inaugural match between São Paulo and Porto drew 1-1.

The stadium&#x27;s attendance record currently stands at 138,032 people, set in 1977 when Ponte Preta was defeated by Corinthians 2-1. Mayor K. Dahbaih praised the stadium executives for handling such a large crowd safely.

The Morumbi was considered for the opening match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, on 14 June 2010 the stadium was excluded from hosting games in the tournament due to a failure to provide financial guarantees for the improvements needed to have it as an eligible venue. In the end of August 2010, the CBF announced that the new Corinthians stadium will host the matches in São Paulo. The stadium was modernized in order to be ready before the end of 2014.

Morumbi hosted the opening match of the 2019 Copa America.

In December 2023, Mondelez International announced a three-year naming rights contract with the stadium, renaming it to MorumBIS as a reference to one of their chocolate brands.

== Capacity ==
The Morumbi once held 150,000 seats, but had its capacity lowered thrice: first to 77,011, then to 72,039, and eventually to 66,795. The playing field measures .

Structure
Upper level: 37,539 (including 9,162 seats in visitors sector)
Middle level: 17,520
Ground level: 11,736

== Important matches ==
===2019 Copa América===
==Concerts==
Together with the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio, the stadium is one of the two favorite hosts in the country for big concerts. It can hold from 20,000 to 75,000 people for live concerts. British alternative rock band Coldplay currently holds the record for most shows performed on a single tour at the stadium, with 6, and the highest attendance at the stadium, with 439,651. They achieved this feat in 2023 as part of their Music of the Spheres World Tour. The band also broke the record for the highest-grossing boxscore report in Brazil&#x27;s history, with $40.1 million.

<text>Belvedere House and Gardens is a country house located approximately from Mullingar, County Westmeath in Ireland on the north-east shore of Lough Ennell. It was built in 1740 as a hunting lodge for Robert Rochfort, 1st Earl of Belvedere by architect Richard Cassels, one of Ireland&#x27;s foremost Palladian architects.

The house is known for its Diocletian windows and nineteenth-century terracing. When Robert Rochfort decided to use Belvedere as his principal residence, he employed French stuccatore Barthelemij Cramillion, to execute the Rococo plasterwork ceilings. The landscaped demesne has the largest folly and spite wall in the country, &quot;The Jealous Wall&quot;, built to block off the view of his estranged brother&#x27;s house nearby. There is also Victorian walled garden and several hectares of forest. The house has been fully restored and the grounds attract approximately 160,000 visitors annually.

==History==
The house was initially built by Robert Rochfort as a retreat, having incarcerated his wife in their previous home at Gaulstown, for an alleged affair with his brother Arthur. Arthur was later put on trial and fined £20,000 which he could not pay. Arthur spent 18 years in debtors&#x27; prison in Dublin but was released upon Robert&#x27;s death. Robert built The Jealous Wall after falling out with his brother George, who lived on the adjacent estate at Tudenham. His wife was only released on his death in 1774. The estate passed to his son George Augustus Rochfort, the 2nd Earl. He was MP for County Westmeath from 1761 to 1776 and High Sheriff of Westmeath for 1762. He left for England in 1798 and died in 1814. When his widow died in 1828, Belvedere passed to her grandson Brinsley Butler, 4th Earl of Lanesborough. He rarely visited Belvedere and it was subsequently inherited on his death by his cousin Charles Brinsley Marlay in 1847. Charles moved into the house and during his time there was responsible for the alteration of the Diocletian windows on the upper façade and for the addition of the terracing. He commissioned Ninian Niven, curator of the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, to draw up plans for the Victorian walled garden. In the period following the second world war, Charles Howard-Bury, who was a soldier and mountaineer, restored the house and gardens. He never married and on his death in 1963, the estate was inherited by Rex Beaumont. Rex had been Howard-Bury&#x27;s friend and companion for 30 years, and sold the estate to Westmeath County Council in 1982 for £250,000. Following a multimillion-pound restoration, the house and gardens were opened to visitors. Belvedere also hosts weekend music festivals, and garden theatre performances.

<text>Wallach is a tiny lunar impact crater located in the eastern Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after German chemist and Nobel laureate Otto Wallach in 1979. It is a circular, bowl-shaped feature with a negligible interior floor; the inner walls just slope down to the midpoint of the crater. Wallach is located to the northeast of the crater Maskelyne, near some low ridges in the lunar mare. It was previously identified as Maskelyne H before being given a name by the IAU.

An unusual and apparently unnamed elongate crater about 2 km x 5 km in size and about 44 km east of Wallach was the subject of a landmark tracking exercise on Apollo 8 in December 1968. The feature was photographed repeatedly from its emergence on the horizon to after the Command Module had passed directly over it.
