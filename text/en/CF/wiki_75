<doc id="964283" wikidata="Q2106293" url="?curid=964283" title="Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection">
<text>An overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is a rare but rapidly fatal infection occurring in individuals following removal (or permanent dysfunction) of the spleen. The infections are typically characterized by either meningitis or sepsis, and are caused by encapsulated organisms including &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;. It is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Death has been reported to occur within 12 hours.

The spleen is necessary for protection against encapsulated bacteria (see Mechanism) and as such when removed by splenectomy it can lead to rapid unchallenged infection by encapsulated bacteria. The rapid progression from mild viral symptoms to sepsis is one of the things that makes OPSI particularly dangerous.

Another source of infection are species of &quot;Babesia&quot;, which are tick-borne parasites that cause babesiosis.

== Signs and symptoms ==
OPSI may initially present with mild viral symptoms such as fever or coughing, however later in infection symptoms may include shakes, shivers, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, malaise, myalgia, headache and abdominal pain.

The disease progresses rapidly from the above mentioned symptoms to coma to refractory septic shock and finally death in as little as 24 hours.

==Mechanism==
The spleen contains many macrophages (part of the reticuloendothelial system), which are immune cells that phagocytose (eat) and destroy bacteria. In particular, these macrophages are activated when bacteria are bound by IgG antibodies (IgG1 or IgG3) or the complement component C3b. These types of antibodies and complement are immune substances called opsonizers, molecules that bind to the surface of bacteria to facilitate phagocytosis.

When the spleen is no longer present (asplenia), IgG and C3b are still bound to bacteria, but they cannot be removed from the blood circulation due to the loss of the splenic macrophages. Hence the bacteria are free to cause infection.

Patients without a spleen often need immunizations against pathogens that normally require opsonization and phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen. These include common human pathogens with bacterial capsules (&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Neisseria meningitidis, E. coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;). Capsules made of polysaccharides (sugars) permit bacteria to evade phagocytosis by macrophages alone, since only proteins are directly recognized by macrophages in phagocytosis. So humoral immunity in forms of IgG and complement proteins is the human immune system&#x27;s response against bacterial capsules.

== Prevention ==
Measures to prevent OPSI include vaccination, prophylactic antibiotics and patient education.

=== Patient education ===
Knowledge of the risks of asplenia correlates with a greatly reduced risk of OPSI, thus patient education is vital to preventing OPSI and may be the most important factor for preventing OPSI. More and more people are increasingly getting their healthcare information from the internet and the lack of reliable, readable and comprehensive information on the risks of asplenia and splenectomy poses a preventable risk factor for asplenic individuals. The majority (as many as 84%) of asplenic individuals are unaware of the risks of asplenia. Encouraging the wearing of bracelets with information about the condition, the carrying of antibiotics, seeking medical advice before travel, especially to places where malaria and babesia is endemic and seeking immediate medical attention following a bite from an animal has been shown to reduce OPSI risk.

===Vaccination===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s annual vaccine recommendations includes specifics for individuals without a functioning spleen.

The Green Book (immunisation guidance, UK) in chapter 7 covers immunisation of people with underlying medical conditions that affect immunity which includes asplenic patients.

As there are a range of different pneumococcal vaccines, the patient should be offered the most up to date ones (typically 23 valent polysaccharide vaccine and 13 valent conjugate vaccine), if they have not had them already as part of standard schedule. Repeat doses are recommended in patients without a spleen.

The CDC recommends against live vaccines and has specific advice for travellers, which includes malaria avoidance for asplenic individuals.

==Prognosis==
OPSI is almost always fatal without treatment, but modern treatment has decreased the mortality to approximately 40–70 percent. Individuals with OPSI are most commonly treated with antibiotics and supportive care.

== Epidemiology ==
The risk of OPSI is 0.23–0.42 percent per year, with a lifetime risk of 5 percent. Most infections occur in the first few years following splenectomy, but the risk of OPSI is lifelong.

The risk is greatest for children and elderly (70+ years old), but it can happen at any age. Greater risk is associated with splenectomy for hematological conditions such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia and tumours when compared to splenectomy due to trauma.

<doc id="964291" wikidata="Q455833" url="?curid=964291" title="Carolyn Maloney">
<text>Carolyn Jane Maloney (née Bosher, February 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2013 to 2023, and for from 1993 to 2013. The district includes most of Manhattan&#x27;s East Side, Astoria and Long Island City in Queens, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as well as Roosevelt Island. A member of the Democratic Party, Maloney ran for reelection in 2022 but lost the primary to 10th district incumbent Jerry Nadler after redistricting drew them both into the 12th district.

Maloney was the first woman to represent New York City&#x27;s 7th Council district (where she was the first woman to give birth while in office). Maloney was also the first woman to chair the Joint Economic Committee. On October 17, 2019, she became the first woman to chair the House Committee on Oversight and Reform following the death of Elijah Cummings. On November 20, 2019, Maloney was formally chosen to succeed Cummings.

==Early life, education, and career==
Carolyn Jane Bosher was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, on February 19, 1946. She attended Greensboro College. After graduating, she visited New York City in 1970, and decided to stay.

For several years, she worked as a teacher and an administrator for the New York City Board of Education. In 1977, she obtained a job working for the New York State Legislature, and held senior staff positions in both the State Assembly and the State Senate. In 1976 she married Clifton Maloney, an investment banker.

==New York City Council==
Maloney was elected to the New York City Council in 1982, defeating incumbent Robert Rodriguez in a heavily Spanish-speaking district based in East Harlem and parts of the South Bronx. She served as a council member for 10 years. On the council, she served as the first chair of the Committee on Contracts, investigating contracts issued by New York City in sludge and other areas. She authored legislation creating the city&#x27;s Vendex program, which established computerized systems tracking information on city contracts and vendors doing business with the city. Maloney also introduced the first measure in New York to recognize domestic partnerships, including those of same-sex couples. She was the first person to give birth while serving as a council member, and the first to offer a comprehensive package of legislation to make day care more available and affordable.

In 1992, Maloney ran for Congress in what was then the 14th district. The district had previously been the 15th, represented by 15-year incumbent Bill Green, a progressive Republican. She won with 51% of the vote. The district, nicknamed the &quot;silk stocking district&quot;, had been one of the few in the city in which Republicans usually did well; in fact, they held the seat for all but eight of the 56 years between 1937 and Maloney&#x27;s victory. But it had been made significantly friendlier to Democrats by redistricting. The old 15th had been more or less coextensive with the Upper East Side, but the new 14th included Long Island City, portions of the Upper West Side, and a sliver of Brooklyn. Maloney also benefited from Bill Clinton&#x27;s strong showing in the district.

The core of Maloney&#x27;s district was the Upper East Side, an area with a history of electing moderate Republicans. Their dominance waned throughout the 1990s, and by the early 2000s Democrats dominated every level of government. This was exemplified in 1994 (the year of the Republican Revolution), when a serious challenger to Maloney, Republican City Councilman Charles Millard, lost badly. No Republican has gotten more than 30% of the vote in the district since.

In 2004, Maloney faced a potential Democratic primary challenge from Robert Jereski, a former Green Party political candidate and unsuccessful candidate for delegate to the 2004 Democratic National Convention on the slate of Dennis Kucinich. Jereski opposed the Iraq War while Maloney had initially voted for the resolution to authorize force; she later renounced the war, including at a town hall meeting in her district with antiwar Congressman John Murtha, where her comments made headlines. Jereski failed to qualify for the ballot because his petition was found to have invalid signatures, leaving him four short of the 1,250 required.

In December 2008, Maloney hired a public-relations firm to help bolster her efforts to be named by Governor David Paterson as Hillary Clinton&#x27;s successor in the U.S. Senate. She toured parts of the state, but was overshadowed by Caroline Kennedy&#x27;s promotional tour for the same seat. Maloney interviewed with Paterson for 55 minutes. Public opinion polls placed Maloney&#x27;s support for the Senate seat in the single digits, trailing the front-runner, then-State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, although her bid was endorsed by the National Organization for Women Political Action Committee, the Feminist Majority Political Action Committee, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Nicholas Kristof, and other columnists and editorial boards.

On January 23, 2009, Paterson chose Representative Kirsten Gillibrand. Since Gillibrand is from upstate, many in NYC&#x27;s political circles urged Maloney to primary Gillibrand in 2010. Despite leading Gillibrand in the polls, she instead ran to retain her congressional seat. A decade later, Maloney was the sole member of Congress to endorse Gillibrand&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.
In the Democratic primary for Congress on September 14, 2010, Maloney defeated a well-funded opponent, Reshma Saujani, a 34-year-old Indian-American hedge fund lawyer, by 62 percentage points. That night, Saujani said, &quot;I&#x27;m definitely running again&quot;, but three months later announced publicly that she would not challenge Maloney again.

In 2012 Maloney&#x27;s Republican challenger was Christopher Wright, who took a leave of absence from J. P. Morgan to campaign. Maloney won with 80.9% of the vote, a margin of over 120,000 votes.

In 2014, Maloney defeated Republican nominee Nicholas Di Iorio, a financial contractor with Pfizer, with 80% of the vote.

In the 2016 Democratic primary, Maloney defeated Pete Lindner with 90.1% of the vote. She defeated Republican Robert Ardini in the general election with 83.2% of the vote.

In the 2018 Democratic primary, Maloney defeated progressive candidate Suraj Patel with 59.6% of the vote. In the general election she defeated Republican nominee Eliot Rabin with 86.4% of the vote.

In the 2020 Democratic primary, Patel challenged Maloney again, as did progressive Democrat Lauren Ashcraft and housing activist Peter Harrison. Erica Vladimer, a co-founder of New York State&#x27;s Sexual Harassment Working Group, withdrew from the race before the primary. By July 29, 2020, it was revealed that Maloney led Patel by about 4% and 3,700 votes. On August 4, 2020, local election officials declared Maloney the winner of the primary.

The redistricting process of 2022 consolidated parts of the 12th and 10th Congressional districts. Maloney chose to face fellow incumbent Jerry Nadler in the Democratic primary race for the newly combined seat, and in August of that year lost the primary to Nadler by thirty points.

===Tenure===
In 2009, the &quot;National Journal&quot;&#x27;s annual ranking placed Maloney as the 114th-most liberal (or 314th-most conservative) member of Congress, with more liberal scores on foreign policy than on economic and social policy. Her score of 75.5 ranked her as modestly more liberal than the New York Congressional delegation as a whole.

In 2011, a &quot;Daily News&quot; survey found that Maloney ranked first among New York&#x27;s 28 representatives for activity with 36 proposed bills, resolutions, and amendments. In the 2013 legislative session, Govtrack.us scored her third among House Democrats for &quot;Leadership&quot;, third among all representatives for &quot;Powerful Co-sponsors&quot;, third-highest in the New York delegation for &quot;Working with the Senate&quot;, and fifth-highest among all representatives for &quot;Bills Sponsored&quot;. During the 2014 election cycle, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; ran a story that said, &quot;Maloney has proposed more legislation than any other House member, according to records&quot;, and called her &quot;James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, giving compensation to Ground Zero workers who have fallen ill, as big a bill for the New York area as any in the last decade.&quot;

For the 2015 legislative session, Govtrack.us scored Maloney first for &quot;Leadership&quot; among House Democrats, based on sponsoring the most bills. It scored her second among all representatives for having the most co-sponsors, second for &quot;Working with the Senate&quot; and fourth among House Democrats for having powerful cosponsors. She was ranked in the top 10% of all representatives for bills introduced (&quot;Maloney introduced 26 bills and resolutions in 2015&quot;).

As a U.S. Representative, Maloney was a superdelegate at presidential conventions. In the 2016 election cycle she was an early supporter of former Secretary of State and Senator Hillary Clinton. According to her 2018 GovTrack Report card Maloney ranked in the 80th percentile among House members for getting bicameral support for the bills she has introduced; she ranked sixth among House Democrats.

In 2019, Govtrack.us ranked Maloney as the top legislative leader in the House. This analysis ranked her second among all representatives for the most co-sponsors on her bills, in the top 5% for the number of bills introduced, and in the top 10% for getting her bills out of committee.

For her tenure as chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee in the 116th Congress, Maloney earned an &quot;A&quot; grade from the nonpartisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

In 2021 the Center for Effective Lawmaking ranked Maloney the third-most effective lawmaker in the House.

====9/11-related issues====

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Maloney advocated for federal help for New York&#x27;s recovery and security efforts. Her efforts prompted Wayne Barrett of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; to write that Maloney was &quot;like a tiger in the House on every dollar due New York.&quot;

On February 25, 2019, she introduced her Never Forget the Heroes Act, HR1327 in the 116th Congress—a bill to establish Permanent Authorization of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund Act. The $10.2 billion authorization was signed into law, establishing that both the World Trade Center Health Program and September 11 Victim Compensation are effectively permanent, with the WTCHP authorized to operate until 2090 and the VCF until 2092.

====National security issues====
After the 9/11 Commission published its findings, Maloney co-founded the bipartisan House 9/11 Commission Caucus and helped write and secure the enactment into law of many of its recommendations to reform the nation&#x27;s intelligence agencies &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; wrote in its annual guide, 2006 Politics in America: &quot;In the 108th Congress, Maloney reached out beyond her usual roles as a liberal gadfly and persistent Bush administration critic, helping win enactment of a sweeping bill to reorganize U.S. intelligence operations.&quot;

Following the Dubai Ports World controversy, Maloney helped secure the passage and enactment of her bill to reform the system for vetting foreign investments in the United States. She has supported Scientology&#x27;s &quot;New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project&quot;.

On October 1, 2020, Maloney co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan’s offensive operations against the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, denounced Turkey’s role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and criticized &quot;false equivalence between Armenia and Azerbaijan, even as the latter threatens war and refuses to agree to monitoring along the line of contact.&quot;

Maloney, who chairs the House Oversight and Reform Committee, called on FBI Director Christopher A. Wray to open a probe into social media platform Parler, writing, &quot;The company was founded by John Matze shortly after he traveled in Russia with his wife, who is Russian and whose family reportedly has ties to the Russian government.&quot;

====Gun control====
In response to a number of high-profile incidents of gun violence, Maloney sponsored two bills to address the issue. The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2013 would make gun trafficking a federal crime for the first time and substantially stiffen the penalties for &quot;straw buyers&quot; who knowingly help convicted felons, domestic abusers, the violently mentally ill and others, obtain guns.

In 2014, she joined Senator Ed Markey in sending President Barack Obama a letter asking him to insert $10 million into the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to resume research on gun violence and &quot;conduct scientific research on the causes and prevention of gun violence.&quot;

In 2022, as chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Maloney held a hearing that examined leading gun manufacturers&#x27; marketing and sales practices.

====Government transparency====
Maloney introduced a bill in October 2003 intended to enforce transparency in relation to military contracting in Iraq and subject the Coalition Provisional Authority to federal procurement law. In 2008, after reports of corruption among military contractors in both Iraq and Afghanistan, she secured House passage of a further bill to create a database to better monitor all federal contracts, the key provisions of which were adopted into law as part of the defense budget.

In 2010, the Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Maloney with its Good Government Award for her contributions to government transparency and oversight, including her investigations into corruption and mismanagement in the Minerals Management Service and her support of a Federal Contractor Misconduct Database similar to POGO&#x27;s.

In 2019, Maloney introduced a bill that would require corporate entities to disclose the identities of beneficial owners to FinCEN, making it harder for them to hide assets and avoid taxes through a series of limited liability companies.

====Healthcare====
Maloney has taken several actions on health care issues. Her measure to provide Medicare coverage for annual mammograms was included in the Fiscal Year 1998 federal budget. She advocated for providing federal support for medical monitoring and health care for rescue and recovery workers who were exposed to toxic smoke and dust at the Ground Zero site after the 9/11 attacks. Maloney authored the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act and led the fight for years to push for its passage. In 2010 Obama signed the bill into law. It provides $4.3 billion in federal funds to provide 9/11 responders and survivors with treatment and compensation for their injuries. In June 2012, it was announced that the program would be expanded to cover care for a variety of cancers of the lung, trachea, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, bladder, kidney, thyroid and breast.

In 2015 when roughly 33,000 responders and survivors were battling an assortment of ailments, Maloney led the effort to extend the bill permanently. After a prolonged and very public push, a total of $8.5 billion in funding was included in the Omnibus Spending bill that passed in 2015 and extended the life of the monitoring and health insurance coverage for 75 years. In the 111th Congress, Maloney introduced The Breastfeeding Promotion Act to protect breastfeeding in the workplace under civil rights law and make it illegal for women to lose their jobs or otherwise be discriminated against for expressing milk during lunchtime or on breaks. She has advocated for international women&#x27;s health and family planning programs supported by the United Nations Population Fund.

A co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Working Group on Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, Maloney serves on the board of the Michael Stern Parkinson&#x27;s Research Foundation and previously served as an honorary board member of the Fisher Center for Alzheimer&#x27;s Research Foundation.

Maloney has promoted scientifically discredited claims of a link between vaccines and autism. On several occasions, she has introduced legislation that would direct the federal government to conduct studies into the alleged links between autism and vaccines. In a 2012 congressional hearing, Maloney equated concerns over a link between autism and vaccines to concerns over a link between smoking and cancer. She said that it was &quot;common sense that [smoking] was bad for your health... The same thing seems to be here with the vaccinations.&quot;

Maloney&#x27;s views on vaccines changed, and she led efforts to bring COVID-19 vaccine sites to North Brooklyn and western Queens. She partnered with The Floating Hospital and the New York City Housing Authority to establish a modular site to provide COVID-19 testing and vaccination services at Astoria Houses in northwest Queens.

====Financial and economic issues====
Maloney serves on the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and is the Ranking Democratic member of the Joint Economic Committee. She previously chaired the Democratic Task Force on Homeland Security. From 2009 to 2011, Maloney chaired the Joint Economic Committee, the first woman to do so.

Maloney was the author of the Credit Cardholders&#x27; Bill of Rights, or the Credit CARD Act of 2009, while serving as chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, in the 110th Congress. A 2014 Social Science Research Network study estimated that since its passage, the CARD Act has saved consumers $11.9 billion per year. Credit card companies fiercely opposed the measure, but it drew praise from editorial boards and consumer advocates. The bill was passed as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act by both houses of the 111th Congress, prompting Money magazine to dub Maloney the &quot;best friend a credit card user ever had.&quot; Obama signed the Credit Card Bill of Rights into law in a Rose Garden ceremony Maloney attended on May 22, 2009.

Days after voting against cancellation of a $1 billion, 10-year subsidy plan for U.S. sugar farmers within the 2007 U.S. Farm Bill, Maloney hosted a fundraising event that netted $9,500 in contributions from sugar growers and refiners, according to Federal Election Commission records. Her election attorney, Andrew Tulloch, called the timing of the July 31 fundraiser &quot;pure coincidence.&quot; The bill passed the House by a 282–144 vote. The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the House, Maloney has the ninth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks. She received a perfect 100 rating from the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund in 2007, a perfect 100 rating from Environment America in 2008 and a perfect 100 from the League of Conservation Voters in 2008. And in 2008, Maloney introduced the Minerals Management Service Improvement Act (HR 7211) as a House companion to Integrity in Offshore Energy Resources Act (S. 3543). The legislation would impose dramatically tougher ethics rules for the Minerals Management Service, which was at the center of a major corruption scandal stemming from its employees&#x27; relationships with oil company representatives.

====Women&#x27;s, children&#x27;s and family issues====

Maloney has been active on many other issues involving women, children and families since the beginning of her career. A former co-chair of the House Caucus on Women&#x27;s Issues, she authored and helped secure the enactment into law of a measure to provide federal funding to clear the backlog of rape kits for which evidence had been collected, but never entered into law enforcement DNA databases. The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network called it &quot;the most important anti-rape legislation ever considered by Congress&quot;. Maloney&#x27;s bill, included in the Justice for All Act of 2005, was named the Debbie Smith Act in honor of Debbie Smith, a rape survivor. The effort to enact the bill was later the subject of a Lifetime Television movie, &quot;A Life Interrupted: The Debbie Smith Story&quot;, in which Maloney was played by Lynne Adams. Maloney also co-authored and helped secure passage of bipartisan legislation to curb the demand for sex trafficking.

Maloney introduced the Child Care Affordability Act of 2007 to increase access to child care by providing tax credits. Her amendment to a foreign aid bill succeeded in securing $60 million in funding for programs for Afghan women and girls and to help establish an Afghan commission on human rights. She is the chief House sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment. In 2008 and again in 2009, Maloney authored, and secured House passage of, a bill to provide four weeks of paid parental leave to federal employees.

In 2011, Maloney sponsored the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, known as the Campus SaVE Act. It became part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act of 2013. The measure guarantees counseling, legal assistance, and medical care on campuses for victims of sexual assault, establishes minimum, national standards for schools to follow in responding to allegations of sexual assault and sexual violence, and makes explicit that schools must provide to both the alleged perpetrator and the alleged victim the same rights, including access to advisers, written notifications, as well as appeals processes during campus disciplinary proceedings.

Saying that &quot;for too long, women&#x27;s stories have been left out of the telling of our nation’s history&quot;, Maloney began work in the 1990s on establishing a Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum on the National Mall. After years of effort, her bill passed and was signed into law in 2020.

After Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA, Maloney and Jackie Speier introduced a resolution to recognize that the ERA had met all legal requirements to be considered the 28th amendment to the Constitution. In March 2022, Maloney sent U.S. archivist David Ferriero a letter urging him to fulfill his statutory duty and publish the ERA.

====District issues====
Maloney has helped secure funding for major mass transit projects, resulting in the commitment of billions of federal dollars for New York State. She has been hailed as a champion of the Second Avenue Subway.

Maloney co-sponsored the 2009 reintroduction of the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act (, originally introduced as in 2008) and the Research Works Act () introduced in 2011. Both bills aim to reverse the NIH&#x27;s Public Access Policy, which mandates open access to NIH-funded research. Some scientists criticized the Association of American Publishers-backed Research Works Act. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, Michael Eisen said the bill would force the public to pay $15–$30 per paper to read the results of research they had already paid for as taxpayers. (Such results must now be published in Pubmed Central (PMC) after an embargo period of up to 12 months; this embargo period was imposed to minimize financial harm to publishers who were concerned that their readership would diminish if the results appeared concurrently in PMC, though authors of the paper are required to submit their papers to PMC as soon as their paper gets accepted for publication by a peer-review journal.) Some have suggested that Maloney supports the measure because she is the recipient of campaign contributions from Elsevier, the largest scholarly publishing company. On February 27, 2012, following a boycott of the organization, Maloney wrote to her constituents, &quot;it is important to be mindful of the impact of various industries on job creation and retention. New York State is home to more than 300 publishers that employ more than 12,000 New Yorkers, many of whom live in or around New York City in my district. New York City scientific publishers represent a significant subset of the total, and more than 20 are located in Manhattan, publishing thousands of scientific journals and employing thousands of New Yorkers.&quot; Elsevier withdrew its support for the legislation.

In 2021, Maloney protested the expansion of the New York Blood Center, a nonprofit biomedical research facility, from a three-story-headquarters to a 16-story tower on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side.

==Controversies==
===Wearing burqa on House floor===

On October 16, 2001, Maloney wore an Afghan burqa while giving a speech in the United States House of Representatives in support of Afghan women&#x27;s rights and American military involvement against the Taliban. It was the first time an Islamic veil had been worn on the House floor, and was technically not allowed under an unenforced 1837 hat ban.

In a 2018 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article, Rafia Zakaria, a Pakistani-American feminist author and journalist, called Maloney&#x27;s display &quot;theatrical&quot; and an example of &quot;American feminist exceptionalism, in which American women—intrepid and veil-free—are beacons of freedom with a duty to evangelize their particular brand of empowerment, even if it means using bombs.&quot; Muslim-American Rana Abdelhamid, while running in the Democratic primary against Maloney in 2021, criticized this event as feeding negative stereotypes about Muslims and of &quot;weapon[izing my identity] to justify American wars&quot;. Maloney subsequently defended it as being necessary to make her point.

===Use of the N-word===
On July 20, 2009, Maloney apologized after saying the ethnic slur &quot;nigger&quot; while quoting a phone call she had received about U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in an interview with &quot;City Hall News&quot;. At the time, she was a week away from announcing an official campaign against Gillibrand in the 2010 United States Senate Democratic Primary election in New York. The quote, as reported by &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, was: 

Civil rights activist Al Sharpton criticized the remark and called Maloney&#x27;s casual use of the word &quot;alarming&quot; but said he did not believe she was racist. She apologized and dropped out of the race on August 7, 2009, reportedly for different reasons.

===2022 primary===
During the 2022 primary, Maloney campaigned on her work within the district, as well as her gender in the wake of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;. Many of Maloney&#x27;s activities were scrutinized, including her comments and legislation promoting the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism. During a debate with Nadler, Maloney attracted attention for saying that she believed President Joe Biden would not run for reelection in 2024. She also told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she thought he should not run in 2024. Maloney later apologized and said that Biden should run again, though she maintained her belief that he would not.

===Alleged Met Gala solicitation===
In 2022, the House Ethics Committee was investigating Maloney for allegedly casting around for an invitation to the Met Gala. Investigators alleged Maloney had sought an invitation for herself after being cut from the invite list in 2016. Maloney called former president of the Met Emily Rafferty to request an invitation, according to testimony Rafferty gave investigators. Investigators also found that Maloney might have requested an invitation to the 2020 Met Gala, citing an email thread with a staffer in which she asked whether she was invited and how to contact the Met&#x27;s government affairs staffer. In a February 2022 report, the Office of Congressional Ethics said it found &quot;substantial reason to believe that Rep. Maloney may have solicited or accepted impermissible gifts associated with her attendance at the Met Gala.&quot;

== Electoral history ==

























































==Personal life==
Maloney and her husband, Clifton Maloney, raised two daughters. Her husband died on a climbing expedition in 2009, after climbing the world&#x27;s sixth-tallest peak, Cho Oyu in Tibet.

<doc id="964297" wikidata="Q7867460" url="?curid=964297" title="USS Aspro (SSN-648)">
<text>USS &quot;Aspro&quot; (SSN-648) was a launched in 1969 and decommissioned in 1995. Scrapping was completed in 2000.

It was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the aspro, a fish of the &quot;Zingel&quot; genus found abundantly in the upper Rhone River.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Aspro&quot; was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 26 March 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 23 November 1964. She was launched on 29 November 1967, sponsored by Mrs. Robert H. B. Baldwin, and commissioned on 20 February 1969 with Commander Roy Wight in command.

==Service history==

===1969===
&quot;Aspro&quot; departed Pascagoula on 26 February 1969 for Key West, Florida, where she loaded torpedoes. She then headed to her home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, transiting the Panama Canal on 8 March 1969, and arriving at Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands on 24 March 1969. She joined the United States Pacific Fleet as a member of Submarine Squadron 1 in Submarine Division 12. Following three weeks of upkeep at Pearl Harbor, she proceeded to Bangor, Washington, where she unloaded her torpedoes before entering the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, on 23 April 1969 for alignment of her fire-control system. Leaving drydock on 4 May 1969, she held tests along the United States West Coast for one month before returning to Pearl Harbor on 8 June 1969.

Local operations occupied &quot;Aspro&quot;″s time during the month of July 1969. In August 1969, she served as a school ship for prospective commanding officers and took part in two exercises, &quot;Kilo 5–69&quot; and &quot;Holdex 4–69&quot;, carried out in the Hawaiian operating area. Weapons tests and a nuclear reactor safety examination preceded her entry into the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard that autumn for post-shakedown repairs.

===1970===
&quot;Aspro&quot; got underway again on 6 March 1970 to conduct sea trials around Hawaii, followed by weapons trials during April. From 18 May through 12 June 1970, upkeep at the Submarine Base Pearl Harbor occupied her time. She then began to prepare for a deployment.

On 19 July 1970, &quot;Aspro&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for a six-month Western Pacific deployment. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 10 September 1970 and commenced upkeep. On 29 September 1970, she visited Okinawa and, the next day, began more than a month of United States Seventh Fleet operations. She returned to Okinawa on 8 November 1970 and shifted to Subic Bay in the Philippines on 15 November for two weeks of upkeep. She sailed to Hong Kong late in November, providing services to aircraft along the way, and arrived at Hong Kong on 1 December 1970 for a week of leave and liberty. After an antisubmarine warfare exercise between 8 and 17 December 1970, she operated on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin in support of Vietnam War operations before returning to Subic Bay on 31 December 1970.

===1971===
&quot;Aspro&quot; left the Philippines on 2 January 1971 bound for Guam, where she spent several weeks engaged in tests before returning to Pearl Harbor on 5 February 1971. She spent the remainder of 1971 in Hawaii, alternating periods in port with exercises in the Hawaiian operating area.

===1972===
On 5 January 1972, &quot;Aspro&quot; commenced a restricted shipyard availability for alterations and repairs at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, which was followed by another month in upkeep. On 11 March 1972, she resumed operations in Hawaiian waters and, on 15 April, began preparations to deploy.

&quot;Aspro&quot; got underway for her second Western Pacific deployment on 13 May 1972 and arrived at Yokosuka on 24 June. After a week in port, she departed on 4 July 1972 to begin Seventh Fleet operations. She arrived at Pusan, South Korea, on 13 August 1972 for a two-day visit, then shifted to Sasebo, Japan, for three days. Following an exercise with one of her sister ships, the attack submarine , from 18 to 26 August, &quot;Aspro&quot; arrived at Hong Kong on 27 August 1972. On 2 September, she was underway for Guam, where she arrived on 7 September and began two weeks of upkeep. On 21 September, she put to sea to return to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 18 November 1972. She remained in port there through the end of 1972.

===1973–1974===
&quot;Aspro&quot; operated in the Hawaiian area conducting tests until she left Pearl Harbor on 17 March 1973 bound for Pascagoula. She transited the Panama Canal on 28 March 1973 and commenced an overhaul at the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s yards in Pascagoula on 1 April 1973.

The shipyard work ended on 12 May 1974, and &quot;Aspro&quot; departed Pascagoula the next day. After re-transiting the Panama Canal, she made liberty stops at San Diego, California, and Bremerton, then held acoustic trials in Puget Sound from 4 to 7 June 1974. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 June after an absence of more than 15 months and spent the rest of 1974 conducting operations in the Hawaiian Islands.

===1975===
The beginning of 1975 found &quot;Aspro&quot; preparing for her third deployment to the Western Pacific. After loading weapons, she left Pearl Harbor on 29 May 1975, conducted an exercise with the destroyer escort the next day, and reached Yokosuka on 10 June 1975 for a week″s visit. On 19 June, she began operations at sea that lasted until 10 August 1975 when she arrived at Guam. She participated in exercises with units of the Seventh Fleet from 24 August to 3 September 1975, made voyage repairs at Subic Bay from 4 to 16 September, and carried out exercises near Subic Bay with the attack aircraft carrier between 17 and 29 September 1975.

&quot;Aspro&quot; left the Philippines on 1 October 1975, bound for the Mariana Islands. She arrived at Guam in the Marianas on 5 October and remained there until 27 October to replace the battery with the assistance of the submarine tender. She then departed for Hong Kong. From 6 to 18 November 1975, she took part in antisubmarine warfare exercises with Seventh Fleet air and surface units. After pausing briefly at Guam, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 4 December 1975 and commenced a post-deployment stand down to allow her crew to rest and recuperate.

===1976–1978===

&quot;Aspro&quot; spent the first two and one-half months of 1976 in upkeep and on exercises. On 15 March 1976, she entered drydock at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Upon completion of this work on 23 April 1976, she began sea trials, exercises, and final preparations for a tour of duty along the west coast of North America.

&quot;Aspro&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 6 September 1976 and stopped at Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada, on 16 September for a two-day liberty call. She arrived at Bangor on 23 September 1976 to unload her weapons.

In October 1977, &quot;Aspro&quot; commenced an overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on Puget Sound at Bremerton, Washington. The overhaul included a refueling of the nuclear reactor; it was completed in March 1979, and &quot;Aspro&quot; then returned to Pearl Harbor.

===1979===
&quot;Aspro&quot;″s overhaul was completed on 11 March 1979, when she got underway for sea and acoustic trials. On 28 April, she went to Bangor for weapons trials. She departed Bangor on 17 May 1979 and made a voyage to San Diego, conducting deep-water acoustic trials en route. Upon her arrival in San Diego on 22 May, she spent one week undergoing repairs by auxiliary repair dock .

&quot;Aspro&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 June 1979 after an absence of 21 months and spent the remainder of 1979 conducting training exercises and antisubmarine warfare operations and preparing for a deployment in 1980.

===1980===
&quot;Aspro&quot;″s pre-deployment preparations continued well into February 1980. She departed Pearl Harbor to begin her fourth Western Pacific deployment on 24 February 1980 and arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 9 March. On 11 March, she put to sea to take part in Exercise &quot;SHAREM 35.&quot; She returned briefly to Buckner Bay on 16 March then set out for the Philippines. She entered Subic Bay on 20 March 1980 and remained there until 6 April; when she got underway for Guamn in the Mariana Islands. &quot;Aspro&quot; stayed at Guam from 12 to 24 April 1980, then departed for Japan. She made a brief stop at Yokosuka on 4 May 1980 before embarking upon a month of operations at sea. She returned to Yokosuka on 10 June 1980 but put to sea again on 12 June on her way to Hong Kong for a liberty call there that lasted from 17 to 21 June. &quot;Aspro&quot; then headed back to Guam, where arrived on 27 June. She put back to sea on 16 July 1980 for her last operational assignment of the deployment. She concluded both that operation and the overall deployment by returning to Pearl Harbor on 30 August 1980.

Following the usual post-deployment stand-down period, &quot;Aspro&quot; resumed local operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the remainder of 1980.

===1981===
At the beginning of 1981, &quot;Aspro&quot; began a restricted shipyard availability for repairs and alterations at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard that lasted until late in March 1981. On 26 March, she left the shipyard and resumed normal operations out of Pearl Harbor until midsummer 1981, when she began getting ready for another tour of duty in the Western Pacific.

&quot;Aspro&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor to commence her fifth Western Pacific deployment on 2 September 1981. During the deployment, she visited a variety of ports in the Western Pacific and in the Indian Ocean. including a R&amp;R port call to HMAS Stirling, Rockingham, Western Australia from 30 November – 7 December 1981, the only time &quot;Aspro&quot; would visit Western Australia. &quot;Aspro&quot; successfully prosecuted all her operational missions. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 March 1982 and commenced the normal month of post-deployment leave and upkeep.

===1982===
&quot;Aspro&quot; resumed operations out of Pearl Harbor in April 1982. She participated in the multinational exercise Operation &quot;RIMPAC 82&quot; and served as a training platform for both prospective commanding officers and midshipmen. Early in July 1982, she embarked upon a five-week cruise that took her to the California coast and back, during which she participated in antisubmarine exercises and in the fleet exercise FLEETEX 1–82. &quot;Aspro&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 August 1982 and began preparations for a cold-weather deployment.

On 15 October 1982, &quot;Aspro&quot; and one of her sister ships, the attack submarine , got underway for the Arctic. In addition to cold-weather drills, the two submarines gathered scientific data. They also made a winter rendezvous at the North Pole on 20 November 1982, celebrated by the mailing of cachet envelopes prepared especially for the occasion. &quot;Aspro&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 December 1982 and began a period of stand-down and upkeep.

===1983–1984===
In February 1983, &quot;Aspro&quot; resumed duty in the Hawaiian operating area, which continued through May. In June 1983, &quot;Aspro&quot; began preparations for her sixth tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific.

&quot;Aspro&quot; departed Pearl Harbor in July 1983 for the deployment, which was highlighted by visits to many of the exotic ports of East Asia and successful completion of all assigned missions. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1983 and, after the post-deployment stand-down, took up local operations. That duty continued into the beginning of 1984.

On 16 January 1984, &quot;Aspro&quot; entered the medium auxiliary floating drydock for a restricted availability for repairs and alterations. Later, she resumed operations at sea.

On 24 July 1984, &quot;Aspro&quot; began her seventh deployment to the Western Pacific. Operating both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, &quot;Aspro&quot; carried her assignments to successful conclusions and made a number of port calls.

===1985–1986===
&quot;Aspro&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor from her deployment in January 1985 and, following the usual leave and upkeep period, embarked upon local operations in the Hawaiian Islands once more. In April 1985, she visited the United States West Coast again. That summer, she voyaged to the Arctic for more cold-weather drills. She returned to Hawaii at the end of September and resumed local operations in October, which she continued through April 1986.

In May 1986, &quot;Aspro&quot; headed north for another round of cold-weather exercises in the Arctic. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 11 July 1986 and remained in the Hawaiian Islands until early September 1986, when she cruised to the Northern Pacific Ocean. &quot;Aspro&quot; concluded that voyage on 27 October 1986 at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, where she began a regular overhaul on 15 November 1986.

===1987–1994===

&quot;Aspro&quot; spent a significantly longer time at Mare Island Naval Shipyard than originally scheduled. During her overhaul, new sonar and fire-control system technologies became available and were installed during the delay. The delay also allowed &quot;Aspro&quot; to have anechoic (acoustic) tiling installed on her hull, making her one of the quietest attack submarines in the United States Pacific Fleet.

At the conclusion of her overhaul, &quot;Aspro&quot; and her crew scored an EXCELLENT on the Post-Overhaul Reactor Safeguards Examination (PORSE), a rare feat for any nuclear-powered ship. She followed up this extraordinary achievement with outstanding performances on Tactical Readiness Examinations against much newer ships.

&quot;Aspro&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in October 1989. As she rounded the bend into the submarine base, the other moored submarines, led by her sister ship , sounded their whistles for over four minutes, welcoming &quot;Aspro&quot; back to her home port.

After her return, &quot;Aspro&quot; deployed twice to the Western Pacific and twice to the Northern Pacific. She won the Battle Efficiency Award (Battle &quot;E&quot;) for Submarine Squadron 1 three times in the next four years, twice under CDR J. A. &quot;Andy&quot; Borchardt and once under CDR J. M. &quot;Mike&quot; Willy. ASPRO was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for performance during a period in 1994 while deployed to the Western Pacific. During her final WESTPAC cruise, she made port calls in Hong Kong, Guam, Sasebo Japan, and New Caledonia, with CDR Willy in command. USS ASPRO had her decommissioning ceremony at Naval Base Pearl Harbor in early 1995 upon return from her final cruise, and completed the formal decommissioning process at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in 1995, with CDR Keith Sauls in command for the decommissioning process.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Aspro&quot; was formally decommissioned on 31 March 1995 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day, although her decommissioning ceremony was not held until 2 April 1995. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton began on 1 October 1999 and was completed on 3 November 2000.

<text>Sundacarpus is a monotypic genus of conifers containing a single species Sundacarpus amarus, belonging to the family Podocarpaceae. &quot;Sundacarpus&quot; was designated a genus by C.N.Page in 1989; formerly it had been classified variously as a species of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; or of &quot;Prumnopitys&quot;.

&quot;Sundacarpus amarus&quot; is a large evergreen tree, in height, with a trunk from in diameter. The leaves are long and narrow.

&quot;Sundacarpus amarus&quot; is native to parts of Australia and Malesia. In Australia, the genus is found only in Queensland, primarily on the Atherton Tableland and adjacent parts of northeastern coastal Queensland. It is quite common in New Guinea, New Britain, and New Ireland, where it is often found in montane forests together with southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;). &quot;Sundacarpus amarus&quot; is also found on the Indonesian islands of Buru, Halmahera, Morotai, Sulawesi, Lombok, Flores, Timor, Sumbawa, Java, Sumatra, in Sabah province on the island of Borneo and on Mindanao and Luzon in the Philippines.

<doc id="964310" wikidata="Q2287910" url="?curid=964310" title="José Moñino, 1st Count of Floridablanca">
<text>José Moñino y Redondo, 1st Count of Floridablanca (October 21, 1728 – December 30, 1808) was a Spanish statesman. He was the reformist chief minister of King Charles III of Spain, and also served briefly under Charles IV. He was arguably Spain&#x27;s most effective statesman in the eighteenth century. In Spain, he is simply known as &quot;Conde de Floridablanca&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born at Murcia in 1728 as the son of a retired army officer. He studied in Murcia and Orihuela, and later law at the University of Salamanca and was an esteemed advocate in the Spanish courts. He became a criminal prosecutor in Castile in 1766. He was given the task of investigating the Esquilache Riots that same year and acquired a reputation as a supporter of the king&#x27;s reformist policies. He defended the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. The chief minister at the time, the Marquis of Esquilache, recognized his ability and made Moñino Spanish ambassador to Pope Clement XIV in 1772. He was rewarded with the title &quot;Count of Floridablanca&quot; in 1773 for succeeding in obtaining the support of the Pope in suppressing the Jesuits.

==Chief minister==

Floridablanca was named chief minister in 1777. He embarked on a thorough reform of the Spanish bureaucracy, establishing a true cabinet in 1787 (the Supreme Council of State). He established commercial freedom in the American colonies in 1778, founded the National Bank of San Carlos in 1782. He involved himself in university reform (Spain&#x27;s universities had become increasingly lax since the 16th century) and improved press liberties. After the expulsion of the Jesuits, Spain&#x27;s higher education system was left woefully understaffed; Floridablanca worked to hire new teachers and administrators and to modernize pedagogical methods. He also established new schools throughout Spain.

During his tenure, Madrid was rebuilt; a great deal of the city dates from this period. Floridablanca regulated the Madrid police and encouraged public works in the city.

===American War of Independence===
As master of Spain&#x27;s foreign policy, Floridablanca sought prominently to restore the economic well-being of Spain. He concluded trade agreements with Morocco and the Ottoman Empire and believed that good relations with Great Britain were key to Spain&#x27;s growth. In spite of this, he was drawn reluctantly into the American War of Independence on the side of France and the American rebels. The war generally went well for Spain and Floridablanca succeeded in restoring much of Spain&#x27;s prestige during the conflict and in 1782 Britain returned the island of Menorca, in the Baleares, and Florida to Spain. However attempts to capture Gibraltar, Jamaica and invade Britain met with failure. During the war Spain negotiated for a separate peace with Britain, in spite of its alliance with France. Talks were held between Richard Cumberland and Thomas Hussey. These discussions ultimately fell through, and Spain was a signatory of the Peace of Paris in 1783.

Long-standing disputes with Portugal over the American colonies were resolved under Floridablanca&#x27;s ministry and in the process Fernando Pó, Annobón, and Río Muni (modern Equatorial Guinea) were acquired from Portugal. Floridablanca strove to carve out an independent foreign policy for Spain, distancing the country from France which Spain had been a virtual satellite of since the War of the Spanish Succession.

===French Revolution===
With the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 the liberal movement in Spain, which, in his own way, Floridablanca personified, was shocked to a halt. Floridablanca was forced to react to the situation and supported the First Coalition against revolutionary France. The events in France discredited the reformers at court and contributed to their downfall in the following years.

==Later life==
His centralist policies brought him into conflict with regional interests, and he was often at odds with the Aragonese faction at court, which enjoyed many traditional liberties from the central government. The Aragonese faction, supported by the queen&#x27;s lover Manuel de Godoy and the Count of Aranda, finally succeeded in ousting Floridablanca from power in 1792 on charges of embezzlement. Floridablanca was imprisoned at the castle of Pamplona for three years and released only after the intervention of his brother. He was acquitted in 1795 although the ordeal weighed heavily upon him, and he retired to seclusion on his estates.

When Napoleon marched against Spain in 1808, there was a public outcry for Floridablanca to lead the country in resistance. He accepted the call and became the President of the Supreme Central and Governmental Junta, but at the age of 80, his strength failed him, and he died at Seville on November 20 that year.

Although an avid statesman, he left few writings, and only a few short treatises by his hand on jurisprudence were published during his lifetime.

The plant genus Monnina was named after him.

<doc id="964312" wikidata="Q1274055" url="?curid=964312" title="12AX7">
<text>12AX7 (also known as ECC83) is a miniature dual-triode vacuum tube with high voltage gain. Developed around 1946 by RCA engineers in Camden, New Jersey, under developmental number A-4522, it was released for public sale under the 12AX7 identifier on September 15, 1947.

The 12AX7 was originally intended as replacement for the 6SL7 family of dual-triode amplifier tubes for audio applications. As a popular choice for guitar tube amplifiers, its ongoing use in such equipment makes it one of the few small-signal vacuum tubes in continuous production since it was introduced.

==History==
The 12AX7 is a twin triode basically composed of two of the triodes from a 6AV6, a double diode triode. The 6AV6 is a miniature repackaging (with just a single cathode) of the triode and twin diodes from the octal 6SQ7 (a double-diode triode used in AM radios), which itself is very similar to the older type 75 triode-diode dating from 1930.

==Application==
The 12AX7 is a high-gain (typical amplification factor 100), low-plate-current triode best suited for low-level audio voltage amplification. In this role it is widely used for the preamplifier (input and mid-level) stages of audio amplifiers. It has relatively high Miller capacitance, making it unsuitable for radio-frequency use.

Typically a 12AX7 triode is configured with a high-value plate resistor, 100 kohms in most guitar amps and 220 kΩ or more in high-fidelity equipment. Grid bias is most often provided by a cathode resistor. If the cathode resistor is unbypassed, negative feedback is introduced and each half of a 12AX7 provides a typical voltage gain of about 30; the amplification factor is basically twice the maximum stage gain, as the plate impedance must be matched. Thus half the voltage is across the tube at rest, half across the load resistor. The cathode resistor can be bypassed to reduce or eliminate AC negative feedback and thereby increase gain; maximum gain is about 60 times with a 100k plate load, and a center biased and bypassed cathode, and higher with a larger plate load.

formula_1

Where formula_2 = voltage gain, formula_3 is the amplification factor of the valve, formula_4 is the internal plate resistance, formula_5 is the cathode resistor and formula_6 is the parallel combination of formula_7 (external plate resistor) and formula_8. If the cathode resistor is bypassed, use formula_9.

The initial “12” in the designator implies a 12-volt heater requirement; however, the tube has a center-tapped heater so it can be used in either 6.3-V or 12.6-V heater circuits.

==Similar twin-triode designs==
The 12AX7 is the most common member of what eventually became a large family of twin-triode vacuum tubes, manufactured all over the world, all sharing the same pinout (EIA 9A). Most use heaters which can be optionally wired in series (12.6V, 150 mA) or parallel (6.3V, 300 mA). Other tubes, which in some cases can be used interchangeably in an emergency or for different performance characteristics, include the 12AT7, 12AU7, 12AV7, 12AY7, and the low-voltage 12U7, plus many four-digit EIA series dual triodes. They span a wide range of voltage gain and transconductance. Different versions of each were designed for enhanced ruggedness, low microphonics, stability, lifespan, etc.

Those other designs offer lower voltage gain (traded off for higher plate current) than the 12AX7 (which has a voltage gain or formula_2 of 100), and are more suitable for high-frequency applications.

Some American designs similar to the 12AX7:

* 12AD7 (October 10, 1955 - 225mA heater - low hum)
* 12AT7 (May 20, 1947, dual 6AB4, formula_2 = 60)
* 12AU7 (October 18, 1946, dual 6C4, formula_2 = 17-20)
* 12AV7 (February 14, 1950 - dual 6BC4, formula_2 = 37-41)
* 12AX7 (September 15, 1947 - dual 6DR4, also like octal 6SL7, formula_2 = 100) dual 12AV6 (6AV6)
* 12AY7 (December 7, 1948 - formula_2 = 44, for audio preamp use)
* 12AZ7 (March 2, 1951 - 225mA heater, formula_2 = 60)
* 12DF7 (formula_2 = 100, low microphonics)
* 12DT7 (formula_2 = 100)
* 12DW7 (First triode: formula_2 = 100, Second triode: formula_2 = 17)
* 12U7 (formula_2 = 20, for use in automotive radios on 12-volt plate supply)

Although commonly known in Europe by its Mullard–Philips tube designation of ECC83, other European variations also exist including the low-noise versions 12AX7A, 12AD7, 6681, 7025, and 7729; European versions B339, B759, CV492, CV4004, CV8156, CV8222, ECC803, ECC803S, E2164, and M8137; and the lower-gain low-noise versions 5751 and 6851, intended for avionics equipment.

In European usage special-quality valves of some sort were often indicated by exchanging letters and digits in the name: the E83CC was a special-quality ECC83.
In the US a &quot;W&quot; in the designation, as in 12AX7WA, designates the tube as complying with military grade, higher reliability specifications.

The &#x27;E&#x27; in the European designation classifies this as having a 6.3 volt heater, whereas the American designation of 12AX7 classifies it as having a 12.6 volt heater. It can, of course, be wired for operation off either voltage.

==Manufacturers==
 versions of the 12AX7/ECC83 are available from the following manufacturers:
* In Russia: New Sensor, which produces tubes under the Sovtek, Electro-Harmonix, Svetlana, Tung-Sol, and Mullard brands
* In Slovakia: JJ Electronic (annual production of approximately two million units)
* In China: Hengyang Electronics, Tubes sold under Psvane and TAD brand names. Company owns its independent manufacturing facility in Southern China (former Guiguang tube factory) and recently they acquired former small signal tube manufacturing line from Tianjin Quanzheng factory (TJ Full Music)

<text>Historic Richmond Town is a town and farm museum complex in the neighborhood of Richmondtown, Staten Island, in New York City. It is located near the geographical center of the island, at the junction of Richmond Road and Arthur Kill Road. Staten Island Historical Society and Historic Richmond Town are two different names for the same organization, reflecting its long history and evolution.

Historic Richmond Town consists of more than 30 historic buildings and sites dating from the late 17th to the early 20th centuries. Decker Farm, located about one mile from the center of Historic Richmond Town, features a farm stand and seasonal activities such as pumpkin picking. The site also contains other former commercial and government buildings, as well as farm buildings and homes, some of which were relocated from other parts of Staten Island.

The town was named Richmond Town in the early 18th century when it was formerly a county seat and commercial center, having contained the former courthouse of Richmond County, which is coterminous with the borough of Staten Island. People who lived in Richmond Town were mostly of Dutch, English, or French descent, and the most common jobs were those of blacksmiths, shoemakers, and other craftsman types. British troops were stationed in Richmond Town during the American Revolution.

==History==

The creation of the museum site at Historic Richmond Town was the result of efforts by many Staten Islanders, led by local historians and preservationists: Loring McMillen, William T. Davis and local banker David L. Decker. Fueled by the same depression-era passion for historic preservation which resulted in the creation of Colonial Williamsburg, these men wanted to create a testament to Staten Island&#x27;s rich history in an era of rapid development and urban sprawl.

Established in 1958, Historic Richmond Town is a joint project of the Staten Island Historical Society, an independent nonprofit cultural organization, and the City of New York, which owns the land and the buildings and supports part of its operations with public funds from the Department of Cultural Affairs. 

On June 30, 2020 the Board of the Staten Island Historical Society elected Laura Gentile as board director and president, selecting a woman to lead the organization for the second time in its 164 year history. The previous woman was Edna Hayes, who served as president from 1978 to 1989. 

==Current setting==

The main campus of Historic Richmond Town occupies of a site with 15 restored buildings, offering the opportunity to experience the lifestyle of a 300-year-old community. The two churches located outside the museum site are St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal and St. Patrick&#x27;s Church. A third church, the Reformed Dutch Church of Richmond was demolished. Mount Richmond Cemetery, operated by the Hebrew Free Burial Association, is also adjacent to the site.

==Exhibits==
Visitors to Historic Richmond Town are able to have a first-hand experience of what living there in the 19th century was like.

Guided tour are offered of various homes and shops that are fully furnished and restored to specific periods of interpretation; other buildings are in the process of being restored and are not yet open to the public. While Historic Richmond Town is no longer a year-round living history museum (as it was briefly in the 1980s), demonstrations of historic trades, crafts, and basic household activities by costumed museum interpreters take place during certain special events throughout the year and on a regular basis by reservation for visiting school groups. Special events that are open to the public include Old Home Day (which is the oldest continuous event in the museum’s history, and features the most demonstrations of traditional crafts and trades than any of its other events), the Richmond County Fair, Oktoberfest, Egyptian Festival, Greek Festival, quilting classes, Tavern Concerts, Pumpkin Picking at Decker Farm (October), English Country Dancing, Candlelight Tours, Traditional Dinners, and the Summer Apprenticeship Program. Varying from summer to summer, the Apprenticeship Program allows children up to age 15 to learn historic trades such as tinsmithing, blacksmithing, and cooking using original period specific tools.

The Voorlezer&#x27;s House, dating to c. 1695, is the oldest exhibit as well as the oldest standing elementary school in the United States. Another exhibit to see is the Guyon-Lake-Tysen House, a Dutch Colonial farmhouse dating to c. 1740. The Christopher House, a restoration-in-progress which dates to c. 1720, features the only functioning jambless fireplace in New York City. Among the many structures are outstanding examples of Dutch Colonial and Greek revival architecture, such as The Stephens-Black House, the John Bennett House, The Britton Cottage, the Crocheron House, the Boehm House, the Basket Maker&#x27;s House and the Treasure House.

In 1987, the Staten Island Historical Society purchased and relocated the Jacob Crocheron farmhouse (built ca. 1819-1820) to Historic Richmond Town from its original location at 84 Woodrow Road in the Annadale section of Staten Island, a distance of over 3.1 miles. In the process of moving the building, DOT issued the house seven traffic tickets that were later forgiven. 

==In popular culture==
Historic Richmond Town is featured prominently in the documentary &quot;A Walk Around Staten Island with David Hartman and Barry Lewis&quot;, which profiles the history and culture of Staten Island. It premiered on December 3, 2007, on PBS member station WNET.

Historic Richmond Town is featured in the third season of the television series Boardwalk Empire. A 1920s diner and gas station were constructed and shot on location. These sets were shown in the shows third season, which aired in fall of 2012 on HBO.

Historic Richmond Town was featured in the eighth episode of the first season of the PBS television series History Detectives. The episode follows an investigation into the history of a Union flag in the museum’s collection that purports to date from the 1860s, and features dramatizations set in the Stephens-Black House with costumed museum staff as actors. 

Historic Richmond Town was also featured as a haunted location on the paranormal TV series &quot;Most Terrifying Places&quot; which aired on the Travel Channel in 2019.

<doc id="964341" wikidata="Q2938089" url="?curid=964341" title="Peripartum cardiomyopathy">
<text>Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of pregnancy and up to six months postpartum. As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, PPCM involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) with associated congestive heart failure and an increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even sudden cardiac death. In essence, the heart muscle cannot contract forcefully enough to pump adequate amounts of blood for the needs of the body&#x27;s vital organs.

PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion, wherein patients have no prior history of heart disease and there are no other known possible causes of heart failure. Echocardiography is used to both diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of treatment for PPCM.

The cause of PPCM is unknown. Currently, researchers are investigating cardiotropic viruses, autoimmunity or immune system dysfunction, other toxins that serve as triggers to immune system dysfunction, micronutrient or trace mineral deficiencies, and genetics as possible components that contribute to or cause the development of PPCM. There is a relation with eclampsia and hypertension during pregnancy.

The process of PPCM begins with an unknown trigger (possibly a cardiotropic virus or other yet unidentified catalyst) that initiates an inflammatory process in the heart. Consequently, heart muscle cells are damaged; some die or become scar tissue. Scar tissue has no ability to contract; therefore, the effectiveness of the pumping action of the heart is decreased. Also, damage to the cytoskeletal framework of the heart causes the heart to enlarge, stretch or alter in shape, also decreasing the heart&#x27;s systolic function or output. The initial inflammatory process appears to cause an autoimmune or immune dysfunctional process, which in turn fuels the initial inflammatory process. Progressive loss of heart muscle cells leads to eventual heart failure.

There has been increased research into the &quot;toxic hormonal environment&quot; that generates in late pregnancy as a contributor to the development of PPCM. Prolactin levels increase during late pregnancy and in the six weeks following birth. The 16 kilodalton N-terminal fragment of prolactin hormone has been implicated to have a causal role in genetically susceptible individuals. Thus, therapeutic interventions that block the prolactin pathway and prevent the generation of this fragment are being investigated as potential treatments to stop disease progression in PPCM.

Special considerations should be made for delivery when PPCM diagnosis is made before birth. A multi-disciplinary team should be assembled including experts in obstetrics, cardiology, maternal fetal medicine, and anesthesiology. Stable patients can be delivered vaginally unless there are other obstetric reasons for cesarean section. Attempts to stabilize the mother to delay birth and minimize potential complications of premature birth is a reasonable strategy. Following delivery, due to the increase in venous return, patients need to be closely monitored for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms usually include one or more of the following: orthopnea (difficulty breathing while lying flat), dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion, pitting edema (swelling), cough, frequent night-time urination, excessive weight gain during the last month of pregnancy (1-2+ kg/week; two to four or more pounds per week), palpitations (sensation of racing heart-rate, skipping beats, long pauses between beats, or fluttering), chest pain or tightness, fatigue and light-headedness.

The shortness of breath is often described by PPCM patients as the inability to take a deep or full breath or to get enough air into the lungs. Also, patients often describe the need to prop themselves up overnight by using two or more pillows in order to breathe better. These symptoms, swelling, and/or cough may be indications of pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) resulting from acute heart failure and PPCM.

Physical examination may reveal jugular venous distention, displaced apical impulse, a third heart sound, murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, tachypnea, tachycardia, pulmonary rales, and peripheral edema.

Diagnosis may be delayed or dismissed as early symptoms may be interpreted as being typical of normal pregnancy. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of PPCM are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

It is also quite common for women to present with evidence of having an embolus (clot) passing from the heart to a vital organ, causing such complications as stroke, loss of circulation to a limb, even coronary artery occlusion (blockage) with typical myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Peripartum cardiomyopathy is now a leading cause of maternal death in many parts of the United States and
around the world. Approximately 60% of cases of cardiogenic shock during pregnancy or in the early
postpartum period are caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy.

For these reasons, it is paramount that clinicians hold a high suspicion of PPCM in any peri- or postpartum patient where unusual or unexplained symptoms or presentations occur.

==Diagnosis==
The following screening tool may be useful to patients and medical professionals in determining the need to take further action to diagnose symptoms:

Initial evaluation should include blood work. PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other conditions need to be evaluated and ruled out before this diagnosis will be used. Anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, and renal or liver dysfunction need to be ruled out. Further testing can also include a chest x-ray, brain natriuretic peptide levels (which are usually elevated), EKG, echocardiogram, cardiac MRI, and cardiac catheterization. There is no specific test to get a diagnosis of PPCM.

Genetic testing is indicated in mothers who have peripartum cardiomyopathy to possibly identify pathogenic genetic variants that predispose one to heart failure in pregnancy and allow other family members to be screened if such pathogenic variants exist.

===Ultrasound===
An echocardiography (or an ultrasound of the heart) is the initial diagnostic test of choice in evaluating peripartum cardiomyopathy. The echocardiogram shows reduced systolic function and often left ventricular dilation. 
==Treatment==
Early detection and treatment are associated with higher rates of recovery and decreased morbidity and mortality.

Treatment for PPCM is similar to treatment for congestive heart failure. Conventional heart failure treatment includes the use of diuretics, beta blockers (B-B), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) after delivery. Diuretics, preferably furosemide, help the body to get rid of excess water weight and also lower blood pressure. Fluid restriction is also used to help limit excess water in the body. Using diuretics during pregnancy needs to be done carefully, as diuretics can impair blood flow to the placenta which could potentially cause harm to the fetus. Hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. ACE-I and B-B improve blood circulation and contribute to the reversal of the immune system dysfunction associated with PPCM. If ACE-I is not well tolerated by the patient, it can be replaced by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). ACE-I and ARBs are contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but can be used during the postpartum period as long as breastfeeding is not occurring. Hydralazine with nitrates may replace ACE-I in breastfeeding mothers or before delivery; however, evidence suggests that this course of treatment may not be as effective as ACE-I but beneficial when necessary.

If EF is less than 35%, anticoagulation is indicated, as there is a greater risk of developing left ventricular thrombi (blood clots). Sometimes implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or even heart transplant also becomes necessary.

It is important that the patient receives regular follow-up care including frequent echocardiograms to monitor improvement or the lack thereof, particularly after changes of medical treatment regimes.

Patients who do not respond to initial treatment, defined as left ventricular EF remaining below 20% at two months or below 40% at three months with conventional treatment may merit further investigation, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cardiac catheterization, and endomyocardial biopsy for special staining and for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Antiviral therapy, immunoabsorption, intravenous gamma globulin, or other immunomodulation therapy may then be considered accordingly, but following a controlled research-type protocol.

Since no one knows for sure exactly when to discontinue treatment, even when recovery occurs quickly, it is still recommended that both ACE-I and B-B be continued for at least one year after diagnosis. When considering discontinuing heart failure medications, they should be weaned gradually over time and patients should be closely monitored during this time.

PPCM patients have an increased risk for sudden death and it is seen that they benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy to prevent sudden cardiac death. However, in view of reversible cardiomyopathy, sometimes Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are not routinely used and reserved for severe LV dysfunction or high risk cases.

Bromocriptine is being studied as another potential treatment option, due to its interference with the prolactin pathway which may cause PPCM for some people. Several studies have shown bromocriptine in addition to standard heart failure medications produce better outcomes in terms of both overall recovery and rate of recovery.

==Prognosis==
The most recent studies indicate that with newer conventional heart failure treatment consisting of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, the survival rate is very high at 98% or better, and almost all PPCM patients improve with treatment. In the United States, over 50% of PPCM patients experience complete recovery of heart function (EF 55% or greater). Almost all recovered patients are eventually able to discontinue medications with no resulting relapse and have normal life expectancy.

It is a misconception that hope for recovery depends upon improvement or recovery within the first six to 12 months of diagnosis. Many women continue to improve or recover even years after diagnosis with continued medicinal treatment. Once fully recovered, if there is no subsequent pregnancy, the possibility of relapse or recurrence of heart failure is minimal.

Subsequent pregnancy should be avoided when left ventricular function has not recovered and the EF is lower than 55%. However, many women who have fully recovered from PPCM have gone on to have successful subsequent pregnancies. A significant study reports that the risk for recurrence of heart failure in recovered PPCM patients as a result of subsequent pregnancy is approximately 21% or better. The chance of relapse may be even smaller for those with normal contractile reserve as demonstrated by stress echocardiography. In any subsequent pregnancy, careful monitoring is necessary. A stress test or echocardiogram should be complete prior to a subsequent pregnancy. Where relapse occurs, conventional treatment should be resumed, including hydralazine with nitrates plus beta-blockers during pregnancy, or ACE-inhibitors plus beta-blockers following pregnancy.

Some factors that are associated with a better prognosis are small left ventricle diastolic dimension, LVEF greater than 30-35% at time of diagnosis, absence of troponin elevation, absence of LV thrombus, non-African American ethnicity. Some factors that indicate a poor prognosis are a QRS greater than 120 milliseconds, a delay in diagnosis, high NYHA class, multiparity, African descent.

Mortality estimates have significant differences depending on the racial group being studied, the geographical location, and the length of follow-up in the study. At 1 year follow-up in the United States, mortality rates range from 4%-11%.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that the incidence of PPCM in the United States is between 1 in 1300 to 4000 live births. While it can affect women of all races, it is more prevalent in some countries; for example, estimates suggest that PPCM occurs at rates of one in 1000 live births in South African Bantus, and as high as one in 300 in Haiti.

Some studies assert that PPCM may be slightly more prevalent among older women who have had higher numbers of liveborn children and among women of older and younger extremes of childbearing age. However, a quarter to a third of PPCM patients are young women who have given birth for the first time.

While the use of tocolytic agents or the development of preeclampsia (toxemia of pregnancy) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) may contribute to the worsening of heart failure, they do not cause PPCM; the majority of women have developed PPCM who neither received tocolytics nor had preeclampsia nor PIH.

When looking at the occurrence of PPCM worldwide, the incidence of PPCM is well correlated with maternal mortality rates. This means that in areas with higher maternal mortality, there are also higher rates of PPCM. This suggests that the level of perinatal care may impact the incidence of PPCM.

In short, PPCM can occur in any woman of any racial background, at any age during reproductive years, and in any pregnancy.

<doc id="964342" wikidata="Q1344727" url="?curid=964342" title="Enterprise value">
<text>Enterprise value (EV), total enterprise value (TEV), or firm value (FV) is an economic measure reflecting the market value of a business (i.e. as distinct from market price). It is a sum of claims by all claimants: creditors (secured and unsecured) and shareholders (preferred and common). Enterprise value is one of the fundamental metrics used in business valuation, financial analysis, accounting, portfolio analysis, and risk analysis.

Enterprise value is more comprehensive than market capitalization, which only reflects common equity. Importantly, EV reflects the opportunistic nature of business and may change substantially over time because of both external and internal conditions. Therefore, financial analysts often use a comfortable range of EV in their calculations.

==EV equation==

For detailed information on the valuation process see Valuation (finance).

: Enterprise value = 
:: common equity at market value (this line item is also known as &quot;market cap&quot;)
:: + debt at market value (here debt refers to interest-bearing liabilities, both long-term and short-term)
:: + preferred equity at market value
:: + unfunded pension liabilities and other debt-deemed provisions
:: – value of associate companies
:: – cash and cash equivalents.

==Understanding==
A simplified way to understand the EV concept is to envision purchasing an entire business. If you settle with all the security holders, you pay EV. Counterintuitively, increases or decreases in enterprise value do not necessarily correspond to &quot;value creation&quot; or &quot;value destruction&quot;. Any acquisition of assets (whether paid for in cash or through share issues) will increase EV, whether or not those assets are productive. Similarly, reductions in capital intensity (for example by reducing working capital) will reduce EV.

EV can be negative if the company, for example, holds abnormally high amounts of cash that are not reflected in the market value of the stock and total capitalization.

All the components are relevant in liquidation analysis, since using absolute priority in bankruptcy all securities senior to the equity have par claims. Generally, also, debt is less liquid than equity, so the &quot;market price&quot; may be significantly different from the price at which an entire debt issue could be purchased. In valuing equities, this approach is more conservative than using the &quot;market price&quot;. 

Cash is subtracted because it reduces the net cost to a potential purchaser. The effect applies whether the cash is used to issue dividends or to pay down debt.

Value of minority interest is added because it reflects the claim on assets consolidated into the firm in question.

Value of associate companies is subtracted because it reflects the claim on assets consolidated into other firms.

EV should also include such special components as unfunded pension liabilities, employee stock options, environmental provisions, abandonment provisions, and so on since they also reflect claims on the company.

There are certain limitations and traps in using enterprise value. One of which can be a simplified aggregation of company&#x27;s financial situation. One unit of additional debt may not be of same importance as additional one unit of missing cash.

It can be demonstrated that enterprise value depends on the probability of default (the rating) and works as a &quot;negative growth rate&quot; in the future.

==Usage==
*Because EV is a capital structure-neutral metric, it is useful when comparing companies with diverse capital structures. Price/earnings ratios, for example, will be significantly more volatile in companies that are highly leveraged.
*Stock market investors use EV/EBITDA to compare returns between equivalent companies on a risk-adjusted basis. They can then superimpose their own choice of debt levels. In practice, equity investors may have difficulty accurately assessing EV if they do not have access to the market quotations of the company debt. It is not sufficient to substitute the book value of the debt because a) the market interest rates may have changed, and b) the market&#x27;s perception of the risk of the loan may have changed since the debt was issued. Remember, the point of EV is to neutralize the different risks, and costs of different capital structures.
*Buyers of controlling interests in a business use EV to compare returns between businesses, as above. They also use the EV valuation (or a debt free cash free valuation) to determine how much to pay for the whole entity (not just the equity) since the change of control may require debt repayment. They may also want to change the capital structure once in control.

==Technical considerations==

===Data availability===
Unlike market capitalization, where both the market price and the outstanding number of shares in issue are readily available and easy to find, it is virtually impossible to calculate an EV without making a number of adjustments to published data, including often subjective estimations of value:
* The vast majority of corporate debt is not publicly traded. Most corporate debt is in the form of bank financing, finance leases and other forms of debt for which there is no market price.
* Associates and minority interests are stated at historical book values in the accounts, which may be very different from their market values.
* Unfunded pension liabilities rely on a variety of actuarial assumptions and represent an estimate of the outstanding liability, not a true “market” value.
* Public data for certain key inputs of EV, such as cash balances, debt levels and provisions are only published infrequently (often only once a year in the annual report &amp; accounts of the company).
* Published accounts are only disclosed weeks or months after the year-end date, meaning that the information disclosed is already out of date.

In practice, EV calculations rely on reasonable estimates of the market value of these components. For example, in many professional valuations:
* Unfunded pension liabilities are valued at face value as set out in notes to the latest available accounts.
* Debt that is not publicly traded is usually taken at face value, unless the company is highly geared (in which case a more sophisticated analysis is required).
* Associates &amp; minority interests are usually valued either at book value or as a multiple of their earnings.

===Avoiding temporal mismatches===
When using valuation multiples such as EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT, the numerator should correspond to the denominator. In other words, the profitability metric in the denominator should be available to all stakeholders represented in the numerator. The EV should, therefore, correspond to the market value of the assets that were used to generate the profits in question, excluding assets acquired (and including assets disposed) during a different financial reporting period. This requires restating EV for any mergers and acquisitions (whether paid in cash or equity), significant capital investments or significant changes in working capital occurring after or during the reporting period being examined. Ideally, multiples should be calculated using the market value of the weighted average capital employed of the company during the comparable financial period.

When calculating multiples over different time periods (e.g. historic multiples vs forward multiples), EV should be adjusted to reflect the weighted average invested capital of the company in each period.

<doc id="964344" wikidata="Q5982486" url="?curid=964344" title="Michael McNulty">
<text>Michael Robert McNulty (born September 16, 1947) is a retired American politician from the U.S. state of New York. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1989 to 2009 representing New York&#x27;s Capital District and was chairman of the House Subcommittee on Social Security in the 110th Congress.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
McNulty was born in Troy, New York and attended Troy public schools. He attended the La Salle Institute and graduated from St. Joseph&#x27;s Institute in 1965. He attended Loyola University Rome Center in Rome, Italy from 1967 to 1968. In 1969, McNulty graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.

McNulty is a member of the third generation of Catholic, Irish-American family long prominent in Capital District politics. His grandfather, Jack McNulty Sr., was chairman of the Green Island, New York Democratic Party from 1919 to 1969 and Albany County Sheriff, and McNulty&#x27;s father, Jack Jr., followed Jack Sr. as chairman. and also served as sheriff.

Michael McNulty worked as an insurance broker before entering politics. He was first elected to public office in November 1969 as Green Island&#x27;s town supervisor; at 22, he was the youngest town supervisor in the state. In 1976, he ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly in the 106th Assembly District. He lost to Republican incumbent Neil Kelleher 55%-46%. A year later, he succeeded his father as chairman of the Green Island Democratic Party and was also elected as mayor of the village of Green Island, a post he held until 1982.

==New York Assembly==
After redistricting in 1982, Assemblyman Neil W. Kelleher, of the old 106th District, ran in the new 100th Assembly District, and McNulty ran in the new 106th. McNulty was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 1988, sitting in the 185th, 186th and 187th New York State Legislatures.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===
In 1988, U.S. Congressman Samuel S. Stratton of New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district announced his withdrawal from the race due to health issues. McNulty was selected to replace him on the ballot. He was elected handily in what was then one of the few reliably Democratic areas in Upstate New York. He was reelected nine more times without serious difficulty. The district was renumbered as the 21st District after the 1990 census.

In 2004, he was challenged by Republican/Libertarian Warren Redlich, who ran for governor in 2010. McNulty faced Redlich again in 2006 and was reelected with 78% of the vote: his widest margin. He also had a primary challenge in 1996 by Lee H. Wasserman, in which he won by a closer margin than he ever had in the general election.

In October 2007, McNulty announced that he wouldn&#x27;t seek an 11th term in Congress. Paul Tonko, who had served alongside McNulty in the State Assembly from 1983 to 1989, won the Democratic nomination to replace McNulty, and subsequently won the general election in November. Despite being an open seat, this was not considered a competitive election, as the 21st is considered the most Democratic district in the state outside of the New York City-based districts and Western New York. Both Congressional Quarterly and the Cook Political Report rated the race for the 21st&#x27;s open seat as &quot;Safe Democratic.&quot;

===Tenure===
; Positions
McNulty is a moderate Democrat by New York standards. He voted for the War in Iraq, but since changed his stance and cosponsored Representative John Murtha&#x27;s resolution for a phased withdrawal from the region.

; Controversies

McNulty presided over a vote to recommit an agricultural appropriations bill on the night of August 2, 2007 that would have prevented illegal immigrants from receiving food stamps. McNulty claimed the vote tied 214-214 with members changing their votes after time had expired, McNulty gaveled down a vote and tallied it 212-216 against the motion, while Republicans argued the House screen tally vote was 215-213 in favor to recommit. Republicans chanted &quot;Shame&quot; and later walked out of the House in protest. McNulty and Steny Hoyer apologized on the floor the next morning for prematurely gaveling down the vote. In May 2008, a bipartisan investigation panel including Bill Delahunt and Mike Pence began working to determine whether the vote had been tallied correctly and what action should be taken, if any. A year later, the panel found that the Democrats did indeed improperly tally the vote.

; Rankings/endorsements
He was consistently endorsed by both the Conservative Party and the Working Families Party, third parties in New York.

McNulty received an &quot;A&quot; on the Drum Major Institute&#x27;s 2005 Scorecard on middle-class issues.

<doc id="964356" wikidata="Q140830" url="?curid=964356" title="Cash and cash equivalents">
<text>Cash and cash equivalents (CCE) are the most liquid current assets found on a business&#x27;s balance sheet. Cash equivalents are short-term commitments &quot;with temporarily idle cash and easily convertible into a known cash amount&quot;. An investment normally counts as a cash equivalent when it has a short maturity period of 90 days or less, and can be included in the cash and cash equivalents balance from the date of acquisition when it carries an insignificant risk of changes in the asset value. If it has a maturity of more than 90 days, it is not considered a cash equivalent. Equity investments mostly are excluded from cash equivalents, unless they are essentially cash equivalents (e.g., preferred shares with a short maturity period and a specified recovery date).

One of the company&#x27;s crucial health indicators is its ability to generate cash and cash equivalents. So, a company with relatively high net assets and significantly less cash and cash equivalents can mostly be considered an indication of non-liquidity. For investors and companies cash and cash equivalents are generally counted to be &quot;low risk and low return&quot; investments and sometimes analysts can estimate company&#x27;s ability to pay its bills in a short period of time by comparing CCE and current liabilities. Nevertheless, this can happen only if there are receivables that can be converted into cash immediately.

However, companies with a big value of cash and cash equivalents are targets for takeovers (by other companies), since their excess cash helps buyers to finance their acquisition. High cash reserves can also indicate that the company is not effective at deploying its CCE resources, whereas for big companies it might be a sign of preparation for substantial purchases. The opportunity cost of saving up CCE is the return on equity that company could earn by investing in a new product or service or expansion of business.

== Components of cash ==
* Currency
* Coins
* Bank overdrafts normally are considered as financing activities. Nevertheless, where bank borrowings which are repayable on a demand form an integral part of company&#x27;s cash management, bank overdrafts are considered to be a part of cash and cash equivalents.
* Cash in saving accounts is generally for the saving purposes so that they are not used for daily expenses.
* Cash in checking accounts allow to write checks and use electronic debit to access funds in the account. 
* Money order is a financial instrument issued by government or financial institutions which is used by payee to receive cash on demand. The advantage of money orders over checks is that it is more trusted since it is always prepaid. They are acceptable for payment of personal or small business&#x27;s debts and can be purchased for a small fee at many locations such as post office and grocery. 
* Petty cash is a small amount of cash that is used for payment of insignificant expenses and the amount of it may vary depending on the organisation. For some entities $50 is adequate amount of cash, whereas for others the minimum sum should be $200. Petty cash funds must be safeguarded and recorded in order to avoid thefts. Often there is a custodian appointed who is responsible for the documentation of petty cash transactions.

== Components of cash equivalents ==
* Treasury bills, also called &quot;T-bills&quot;, are a security issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, where their purchase lends money to the U.S. government. T-bills are auctioned in denominations of $100, up to maximum amount of $5 million (or 35% of the auction offering if a competitive bid) and lack a coupon payment, but instead are sold at a discount, their yield being the difference between purchase price and redemption value, which is paid at maturity. Regular series Treasury bills mature in 4, 13, 26 &amp; 52 weeks from their issue date, which may be purchased via TreasuryDirect or a licensed broker. 
* Commercial paper is a bearer document which is used by big companies. The minimum amount permitted is £100,000 and this form of borrowing is not suitable for certain &quot;entities&quot;. Finance companies sell 2/3 of their total commercial paper to the public, but there are also some companies which borrow less and sell their commercial paper to &quot;paper dealers&quot; who then re-sell the papers to the investors. A &quot;round lot&quot; for paper dealers is approximately £250,000.
* Marketable securities make business look more liquid, since they are also included in the calculation of current ratio. These securities are mostly traded on public exchange due to their ready price availability. There are two forms of Marketable Securities: Marketable Equity Securities and Marketable Debt Securities.
* Money market funds are similar to checking accounts, but they mostly pay higher interest rates generated on deposited funds. Net asset Value (NAV) of Money Market funds maintains stable compared to other mutual funds and its share price is constant: $1.00 per share. For businesses, non-profit organizations and many other institutions MMF are very effective &quot;vehicle&quot; for cash management.
* Short-term government bonds are mostly issued by governments to support government&#x27;s spending. They are mostly issued in country&#x27;s domestic currency and in the U.S government bonds include the Savings bond, Treasury bond, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and many others. Before investing into government bond investors should take into account political risk, inflation and interest rate risk.

== Calculation of cash and cash equivalents ==
Cash and cash equivalents are listed on balance sheet as &quot;current assets&quot; and its value changes when different transactions are occurred. These changes are called &quot;cash flows&quot; and they are recorded on accounting ledger. For instance, if a company spends $300 on purchasing goods, this is recorded as $300 increase to its supplies and decrease in the value of CCE. These are few formulas that are used by analysts to calculate transactions related to cash and cash equivalents:

&quot;Change in CCE = End of Year Cash and Cash equivalents - Beginning of Year Cash and Cash Equivalents&quot;.

Value of Cash and Cash Equivalents at the end of period = Net Cash Flow + Value of CCE at the period of beginning

== Liquidity measurement ratios ==
* Current ratio is generally used to estimate company&#x27;s liquidity by &quot;deriving the proportion of current assets available to cover current liabilities&quot;. The main idea behind this concept is to decide whether current assets which also include cash and cash equivalents are available pay off its short term liabilities (taxes, notes payable, etc.) The higher current ratio is, the better is for the organisation.formula_1
* Quick ratio is liquidity indicator that defines current ratio by measuring the most liquid current assets in the company that are available to cover liabilities. Unlike to the current ratio, inventories and other assets that are difficult to convert into the cash are excluded from the calculation of quick ratio.formula_2
* Cash ratio is more restrictive than above mentioned ratios because no other current assets than cash can be used to pay off current debt. Most of the creditors give importance to cash ratio of the company, since it give them idea whether the entity is able to maintain stable cash balances in order to pay off their current debts as they come due.formula_3

== Restricted cash ==

Restricted cash is the amount of cash and cash equivalent items which are restricted for withdrawal and usage. The restrictions might include legally restricted deposits, which are held as compensating balances against short-term borrowings, contracts entered into with others or entity statements of intention with regard to specific deposits; nevertheless, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposit are excluded from legally restricted deposits. Restricted cash can be also set aside for other purposes such as expansion of the entity, dividend funds or &quot;retirement of long-term debt&quot;. Depending on its immateriality or materiality, restricted cash may be recorded as &quot;cash&quot; in the financial statement or it might be classified based on the date of availability disbursements. Moreover, if cash is expected to be used within one year after the balance sheet date it can be classified as &quot;current asset&quot;, but in a longer period of time it is mentioned as non- current asset. For example, a large machine manufacturing company receives an advance payment (deposit) from its customer for a machine that should be produced and shipped to another country within 2 months. Based on the customer contract the manufacturer should put the deposit into separate bank account and not withdraw or use the money until the equipment is shipped and delivered. This is a restricted cash, since manufacturer has the deposit, but he can not use it for operations until the equipment is shipped.

<doc id="964364" wikidata="Q457729" url="?curid=964364" title="John M. McHugh">
<text>John Michael McHugh (born September 29, 1948) is an American politician from the U.S. state of New York who served as the 21st United States Secretary of the Army, and represented the state&#x27;s 23rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.

In June 2009, President Barack Obama nominated McHugh to the position of United States Secretary of the Army. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate and he took office on September 21, 2009.

In July 2015, McHugh announced his intent to resign by November 2015. He retired on November 1, 2015 after more than six years of service. On September 18, 2015, President Obama nominated Eric Fanning to be his replacement.

==Early life and career==
McHugh was born in Watertown, New York. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1966 and attended Syracuse University; in 1970 he graduated from Utica College with a B.A. in political science. He later went on to receive a Master of Public Administration degree from the Nelson A. Rockefeller Graduate School of Public Affairs at the State University of New York at Albany in 1977.

Though he was of draft age during the Vietnam War, McHugh did not serve in the military. He was an assistant to the Watertown city manager from 1971 to 1977. He served as an aide to State Senator H. Douglas Barclay from 1977 to 1984, when he was elected as Barclay&#x27;s successor. McHugh was a member of the New York State Senate from 1985 to 1992, sitting in the 186th, 187th, 188th and 189th New York State Legislatures.

McHugh is also a member on the Board of Directors at the Atlantic Council.

==Congressional career==

He ran successfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992 to replace Congressman David O&#x27;Brien Martin in the 24th district, which was renumbered as the 23rd district following redistricting after the 2000 census. This part of Upstate New York has historically been very Republican at the congressional level, though it has recently become more competitive in presidential elections. The district (and its predecessors) had been in Republican hands continuously since 1871, and some parts of the district had been represented by a Democrat since 1851. McHugh was reelected eight times with no substantive opposition, running unopposed in 2002.

McHugh was a member of the board of directors of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York for 14 years, including a term as chairman.

McHugh was the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, and was also a senior member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He was chairman of the Oversight Committee&#x27;s Post Service Subcommittee for six years, and worked to pass legislation to significantly reform the U.S. Postal Service for the first time since it was demoted from a Cabinet-rank department with passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act () in 2006. He was a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2005 to 2009.

McHugh defeated his Democratic opponent, Dr. Robert J. Johnson, in 2004 and again in 2006. During the campaign, Dr. Johnson found himself unable to fly due to his name appearing on the No Fly List. At the time, Johnson speculated that he was added to the list because of his anti-war views and opposition to McHugh. McHugh&#x27;s office denied any wrongdoing. A later CBS News investigation discovered that the name &quot;Robert Johnson&quot; appeared on the list due to its use as an alias by a man convicted of plotting bombings in Toronto. Several other men named Robert Johnson were affected by its inclusion.

McHugh was the only one of New York&#x27;s eight Republican House incumbents to win more than 60% of the vote in 2006. The other seven were either defeated or were held below 60% by their Democratic challengers. McHugh defeated Democrat Mike Oot in 2008, garnering 65.3% of the vote.

==Political views==
McHugh is a moderate Republican. He had a lifetime rating of 83% from the American Conservative Union.

He was one of only 8 House Republicans to vote &quot;yes&quot; the American Clean Energy Act (also known as Cap and Trade) on June 26, 2009; the measure passed by only eight votes.

==Secretary of the Army==

On June 2, 2009, McHugh was nominated to the position of Secretary of the Army, by President Barack Obama. He was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote on September 16, 2009. He was sworn in as the 21st Secretary of the Army at a Pentagon ceremony on September 21, 2009. McHugh, a Republican appointed by a Democratic president, succeeded Pete Geren, a Democrat appointed by a Republican president. McHugh never served in the military, but in nominating him, President Obama indicated his view that McHugh&#x27;s extensive experience on the House Armed Services Committee had prepared him to serve as the Army&#x27;s top civilian.

In March 2010 McHugh said that he would not pursue discharges against soldiers who told him privately that they were gay. McHugh said he has talked to openly gay soldiers as part of assessing the force&#x27;s opinion on the repeal of a controversial law that bans openly gay people from serving in the military. Under then current law, known as &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell,&quot; service members who declare that they are gay would have to be discharged.

In May 2010, McHugh was granted an honorary degree from the State University of New York Board of Trustees, to be presented during the commencement ceremonies at SUNY Oswego. When the decision to award McHugh the honorary degree was made public, the SUNY Oswego Pride Alliance, an LGBT student group, organized a protest to be held on campus during the ceremony, with students specifically taking issue with his voting record on gay rights. Following weeks of debate on campus, which included a Student Association Senate resolution condemning the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy, McHugh withdrew from the ceremony, stating, &quot;it is obvious that my presence at the ceremony might well have a disruptive effect.&quot;

In March 2015, McHugh revoked a rule allowing Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) to have their ashes interred at Arlington National Cemetery, ruling these women lacked eligibility due to their classification during the war as civilians. This, in spite of the hazards of the duty (38 died while serving their country). After McHugh stepped down, Congress introduced legislation to reverse McHugh&#x27;s action. The legislation passed on May 12, 2016, and was signed into law by President Obama on May 20, 2016.
In July 2015, McHugh announced his intent to resign as secretary by November 1, 2015. He had &quot;expressed his desire to [do so] several weeks&quot; earlier. At the time of the announcement defense secretary Ashton Carter and senior New York senator Charles Schumer expressed praise and appreciation for McHugh&#x27;s service.
In September 2015, President Obama nominated Eric Fanning, who had been serving most recently as interim under secretary, to be McHugh&#x27;s permanent replacement as secretary.

On October 23, 2015 the Army conducted a farewell ceremony for McHugh, which was presided over by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. During the ceremony McHugh was presented with the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service. McHugh completed his term on October 31, 2015.

==Later career==
In June 2016, the K&amp;L Gates international law firm announced that McHugh and his longtime aide, Anne LeMay, had joined the firm to advise clients on procurement and other defense policy matters.

==Personal==
McHugh is divorced from Katherine Sullivan, a daughter of Assemblywoman Frances T. Sullivan. He lives in the hamlet of Pierrepont Manor.

In 2006, McHugh was named one of the 50 most beautiful people on Capitol Hill by &quot;The Hill&quot; magazine.

<doc id="964371" wikidata="Q3631290" url="?curid=964371" title="Lower respiratory tract infection">
<text>Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a term often used as a synonym for pneumonia but can also be applied to other types of infection including lung abscess and acute bronchitis. Symptoms include shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and fatigue. A routine chest X-ray is not always necessary for people who have symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection.
Influenza affects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.
Antibiotics are the first line treatment for pneumonia; however, they are neither effective nor indicated for parasitic or viral infections. Acute bronchitis typically resolves on its own with time.
In 2015 there were about 291 million cases. These resulted in 2.74 million deaths down from 3.4 million deaths in 1990. This was 4.8% of all deaths in 2013.

The World Health Organization has reported that, in 2021, &quot;Lower respiratory infections remained the world’s most deadly communicable disease other than COVID-19, ranked as the fifth leading cause of death.&quot; However, the number of deaths caused has decreased by around 13% from 2000 to 2021. 

== Bronchitis ==
Bronchitis describes the swelling or inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Additionally, bronchitis is described as either acute or chronic depending on its presentation and is also further described by the causative agent. Acute bronchitis can be defined as acute bacterial or viral infection of the larger airways in healthy patients with no history of recurrent disease. It affects over 40 adults per 1000 each year and consists of transient inflammation of the major bronchi and trachea. Most often it is caused by viral infection and hence antibiotic therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals. Viral bronchitis can sometimes be treated using antiviral medications depending on the virus causing the infection, and medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and expectorants can help mitigate the symptoms. Treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics is common but controversial as their use has only moderate benefit weighted against potential side effects (nausea and vomiting), increased resistance, and cost of treatment in a self-limiting condition. Beta2 agonists are sometimes used to relieve the cough associated with acute bronchitis. In a recent systematic review it was found there was no evidence to support their use.

Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) are frequently due to non-infective causes along with viral ones. 50% of patients are colonised with &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, or &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;. Antibiotics have only been shown to be effective if all three of the following symptoms are present: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and purulence. In these cases, 500 mg of amoxicillin orally, every 8 hours for 5 days or 100 mg doxycycline orally for 5 days should be used.

== Pneumonia ==
Pneumonia occurs in a variety of situations and treatment must vary according to the situation. It is classified as either community or hospital acquired depending on where the patient contracted the infection. It is life-threatening in the elderly or those who are immunocompromised. The most common treatment is antibiotics and these vary in their adverse effects and their effectiveness. Pneumonia is also the leading cause of death in children less than five years of age in low income countries. The most common cause of pneumonia is pneumococcal bacteria, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; accounts for 2/3 of bacteremic pneumonias. Invasive pneumococcal pneumonia has a mortality rate of around 20%.
For optimal management of a pneumonia patient, the following must be assessed: pneumonia severity (including treatment location, e.g., home, hospital or intensive care), identification of causative organism, analgesia of chest pain, the need for supplemental oxygen, physiotherapy, hydration, bronchodilators and possible complications of emphysema or lung abscess.

==Causes==

Typical bacterial Infections:
* &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;
* &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;

Atypical bacterial Infections:
* &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;
* &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Chlamydophila pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot;

Parasitic infections:
* Respiratory cryptosporidiosis

Viral infections:
* Adenovirus
* Influenza A virus
* Influenza B virus
* Human parainfluenza viruses
* Human respiratory syncytial virus
* Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
* Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
* Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
Aspiration pneumonia

==Prevention==

Vaccination helps prevent bronchopneumonia, mostly against influenza viruses, adenoviruses, measles, rubella, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, diphtheria, bacillus anthracis, chickenpox, and bordetella pertussis. Specifically for the children with low serum retinol or who are suffering from malnutrition, vitamin A supplements are recommended as a preventive measure against acute LRTI.
==Treatment==
Antibiotics do not help the many lower respiratory infections which are caused by parasites or viruses. While acute bronchitis often does not require antibiotic therapy, antibiotics can be given to patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The indications for treatment are increased dyspnoea, and an increase in the volume or purulence of the sputum. The treatment of bacterial pneumonia is selected by considering the age of the patient, the severity of the illness and the presence of underlying disease. A systematic review of 32 randomised controlled trials with 6,078 participants with acute respiratory infections compared procalcitonin (a blood marker for bacterial infections) to guide the initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment, against no use of procalcitonin. Among 3,336 people receiving procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy, there were 236 deaths, compared to 336 deaths out 3,372 participants who did not. Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy also reduced the antibiotic use duration by 2.4 days, and there were fewer antibiotic side effects. This means that procalcitonin is useful for guiding whether to use antibiotics for acute respiratory infections and the duration of the antibiotic. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are suitable for many of the lower respiratory tract infections seen in general practice. Another cochrane review suggests that new studies are needed to confirm that azithromycin may lead to less treatment failure and lower side effects than amoxycillin. In the other hand, there is no sufficient evidence to consider the antibiotics as a prophylaxis for the high risk children under 12 years.

Oxygen supplementation is often recommended for people with severe lower respiratory tract infections. Oxygen can be provided in a non-invasive manner using nasal prongs, face masks, a head box or hood, a nasal catheter, or a nasopharyngeal catheter. For children younger than 15 years old, nasopharyngel catheters or nasal prongs are recommended over a face mask or head box. A Cochrane review in 2014 presented a summary to identify children complaining of severe LRTI, however; further research is required to determine the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen and the best delivery method.

==Epidemiology==
Lower respiratory infectious disease is the fifth-leading cause of death and the combined leading infectious cause of death, being responsible for 2.74 million deaths worldwide. This is generally similar to estimates in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study.
This total only accounts for &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; infections and does not account for atypical or nosocomial causes of lower respiratory disease, therefore underestimating total disease burden.

==Society and culture==
Lower respiratory tract infections place a considerable strain on the health budget and are generally more serious than upper respiratory tract infections.

Workplace burdens arise from the acquisition of a lower respiratory tract infection, with factors such as total per person expenditures and total medical service utilisation demonstrated as greater among individuals experiencing a lower respiratory tract infection.

Pan-national data collection indicates that childhood nutrition plays a significant role in determining the acquisition of a lower respiratory tract infection, with the promotion of the implementation of nutrition program, and policy guidelines in affected countries.

<doc id="964378" wikidata="Q579211" url="?curid=964378" title="Ramachandran plot">
<text>In biochemistry, a Ramachandran plot (also known as a Rama plot, a Ramachandran diagram or a [φ,ψ] plot), originally developed in 1963 by G. N. Ramachandran, C. Ramakrishnan, and V. Sasisekharan, is a way to visualize energetically allowed regions for backbone dihedral angles ( also called as torsional angles , phi and psi angles ) ψ against φ of amino acid residues in protein structure. The figure on the left illustrates the definition of the φ and ψ backbone dihedral angles (called φ and φ&#x27; by Ramachandran). The ω angle at the peptide bond is normally 180°, since the partial-double-bond character keeps the peptide bond planar. The figure in the top right shows the allowed φ,ψ backbone conformational regions from the Ramachandran et al. 1963 and 1968 hard-sphere calculations: full radius in solid outline, reduced radius in dashed, and relaxed tau (N-Cα-C) angle in dotted lines. Because dihedral angle values are circular and 0° is the same as 360°, the edges of the Ramachandran plot &quot;wrap&quot; right-to-left and bottom-to-top. For instance, the small strip of allowed values along the lower-left edge of the plot are a continuation of the large, extended-chain region at upper left. 
==Uses==
A Ramachandran plot can be used in two somewhat different ways. One is to show in theory which values, or conformations, of the ψ and φ angles are possible for an amino-acid residue in a protein (as at top right). A second is to show the empirical distribution of datapoints observed in a single structure (as at right, here) in usage for structure validation, or else in a database of many structures (as in the lower 3 plots at left). It&#x27;s used to predict about Drug-ligand interaction and helpful in pharmaceutical industries. Either case is usually shown against outlines for the theoretically favored regions.

==Amino-acid preferences==
One might expect that larger side chains would result in more restrictions and consequently a smaller allowable region in the Ramachandran plot, but the effect of side chains is small. In practice, the major effect seen is that of the presence or absence of the methylene group at Cβ. Glycine has only a hydrogen atom for its side chain, with a much smaller van der Waals radius than the CH3, CH2, or CH group that starts the side chain of all other amino acids. Hence it is least restricted, and this is apparent in the Ramachandran plot for glycine (see Gly plot in gallery) for which the allowable area is considerably larger. In contrast, the Ramachandran plot for proline, with its 5-membered-ring side chain connecting Cα to backbone N, shows a limited number of possible combinations of ψ and φ (see Pro plot in gallery). The residue preceding proline (&quot;pre-proline&quot;) also has limited combinations compared to the general case.

==More recent updates==
The first Ramachandran plot was calculated just after the first protein structure at atomic resolution was determined (myoglobin, in 1960), although the conclusions were based on small-molecule crystallography of short peptides. Now, many decades later, there are tens of thousands of high-resolution protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Many studies have taken advantage of this data to produce more detailed and accurate φ,ψ plots (e.g., Morris &quot;et al.&quot; 1992; Kleywegt &amp; Jones 1996; Hooft &quot;et al.&quot; 1997; Hovmöller &quot;et al.&quot; 2002; Lovell &quot;et al.&quot; 2003; Anderson &quot;et al.&quot; 2005&quot;. Ting &quot;et al.&quot; 2010).

The four figures below show the datapoints from a large set of high-resolution structures and contours for favored and for allowed conformational regions for the general case (all amino acids except Gly, Pro, and pre-Pro), for Gly, and for Pro. The most common regions are labeled: α for α helix, Lα for left-handed helix, β for β-sheet, and ppII for polyproline II. Such a clustering is alternatively described in the ABEGO system, where each letter stands for α (and 310) helix, right-handed β sheets (and extended structures), left-handed helixes, left-handed sheets, and finally unplottable cis peptide bonds sometimes seen with proline; it has been used in the classification of motifs and more recently for designing proteins.

While the Ramachandran plot has been a textbook resource for explaining the structural behavior of peptide bond, an exhaustive exploration of how a peptide behaves in every region of the Ramachandran plot was only recently published (Mannige 2017).

The Molecular Biophysics Unit at Indian Institute of Science celebrated 50 years of Ramachandran Map by organizing International Conference on Biomolecular Forms and Functions from 8–11 January 2013.

<doc id="964382" wikidata="Q433119" url="?curid=964382" title="Australian and New Zealand Army Corps">
<text>The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) was originally a First World War army corps of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. It was formed in Egypt in December 1914, and operated during the Gallipoli campaign. General William Birdwood commanded the corps, which primarily consisted of troops from the First Australian Imperial Force and 1st New Zealand Expeditionary Force, although there were also British and Indian units attached at times throughout the campaign. The corps disbanded in 1916, following the Allied evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula and the formation of I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps. The corps was re-established, briefly, in the Second World War during the Battle of Greece in 1941. The term &#x27;ANZAC&#x27; has been used since for joint Australian–New Zealand units of different sizes.

==History==

===Original formation and the Gallipoli disaster===

Plans for the formation began in November 1914 while the first contingent of Australian and New Zealand troops were still in convoy bound for, as they thought, Europe. However, following the experiences of the Canadian Expeditionary Force encamped on Salisbury Plain, where there was a shortage of accommodation and equipment, it was decided not to subject the Australians and New Zealanders to the English winter, and so they were diverted to Egypt for training before moving on to the Western Front in France. The British Secretary of State for War, Horatio Kitchener, appointed General William Birdwood, an officer of the British Indian Army, to the command of the corps and he furnished most of the corps staff from the Indian Army as well. Birdwood arrived in Cairo on 21 December 1914 to assume command of the corps.

It was originally intended to name the corps the Australasian Army Corps, this title being used in the unit diary in line with the common practice of the time which often saw New Zealanders and Australians compete together as Australasia in sporting events. However, complaints from New Zealand recruits led to adoption of the name Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. The administration clerks found the title too cumbersome so quickly adopted the abbreviation A. &amp; N.Z.A.C. or simply ANZAC. Shortly afterwards it was officially adopted as the codename for the corps, but it did not enter common usage amongst the troops until after the Gallipoli landings.

At the outset, the corps comprised two divisions; the Australian Division, composed of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Australian Infantry Brigades and the New Zealand and Australian Division, composed of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade and 4th Australian Infantry Brigade. The 2nd and 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigades were assigned as corps level troops, belonging to neither division.

Despite being synonymous with Australia and New Zealand, ANZAC was a multi-national body: in addition to the many British officers in the corps and division staffs, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps contained, at various points, the 7th Brigade of the Indian Mountain Artillery, Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps troops, the Zion Mule Corps, several battalions from the Royal Naval Division, the British 13th (Western) Division, one brigade of the British 10th (Irish) Division and the 29th Indian Brigade.

===Later formations===
====World War I====
Following the evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula, in December 1915, the Australian and New Zealand units reassembled in Egypt. The New Zealand contingent expanded to form their own division; the New Zealand Division. The First Australian Imperial Force underwent a major reorganisation resulting in the formation of two new divisions; the 4th and 5th divisions. (The Australian 3rd Division was forming in Australia and would be sent directly to England and then to France.) These divisions were reformed into two corps: I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps. I ANZAC Corps, under the command of General Birdwood, departed for France in early 1916. II ANZAC Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Alexander Godley, followed soon after.

In January 1916, the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion, Imperial Camel Corps, was formed with Australian and New Zealand troops. The 1st and 3rd Battalions were Australian, while the 2nd Battalion was British. Then in March 1916, the ANZAC Mounted Division with three Australian and one New Zealand brigade, was formed for service in Egypt and Palestine. The division&#x27;s name was abbreviated to the A. &amp; N. Z. Mounted Division, to the ANZAC Mounted Division, and to the Anzac Mounted Division by the Australian, and the New Zealand official history. Also serving alongside the ANZAC Mounted Division in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was the ANZAC Provost Police Corps, the 1st (ANZAC), 3rd (ANZAC), and 4th (ANZAC) Battalions, Imperial Camel Corps Brigade. There was also the 1st (ANZAC) Wireless Signal Squadron, which served with the British expeditionary force in Mesopotamia in 1916–1917. The acronym was not inclusive. One formation that had troops assigned from both Australia and New Zealand, during the war, and did not use it was the 5th Light Horse Brigade.

In early 1916, the Australian and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand governments sought the creation of an Australian and New Zealand Army, which would have included the New Zealand Division and all of the Australian infantry divisions, but this did not occur.

====World War II====

During World War II, the Australian I Corps HQ moved to Greece in March 1941 (Operation Lustre). As the corps also controlled the New Zealand 2nd Division (along with Greek and British formations), it was officially renamed ANZAC Corps on 12 April. The Battle of Greece was over in weeks and the corps HQ evacuated mainland Greece on 23–24 April, with the name &quot;ANZAC Corps&quot; no longer being used.

Some troops evacuated to Alexandria, but the majority were sent to the Greek island of Crete to reinforce its garrison against an expected German invasion from air and sea. Australians and New Zealanders were respectively deployed around the cities of Rethymno and Chania in western Crete with a smaller Australian force being positioned in Heraklion. The invasion began the morning of 20 May and, after the fierce Battle of Crete, which lasted ten days, Crete fell to the Germans. Most of the defenders of Chania withdrew across the island to the south coast and were evacuated by the Royal Navy from Sfakia. Many others evaded capture for several months, hiding in the mountains with generous assistance from the local Cretan population. Others who were captured and transported to Axis POW camps in mainland Europe were able to escape en route via Yugoslavia. Those who escaped found refuge with Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans until they were either repatriated or recaptured by Axis forces.

====Other conflicts====

During the Vietnam War, two companies from the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment were integrated into Royal Australian Regiment battalions. These integrated battalions had the suffix (ANZAC) added to their name (for example, 4 RAR became the 4RAR/NZ (ANZAC) Battalion). An ANZAC battalion served as one of the infantry battalions of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) from early March 1968 until its withdrawal in December 1971. Due to the rotation of forces, there were a total of five combined battalions of this period.

The ANZAC Battle Group was the official designation of Australian and New Zealand units deployed to Timor Leste as part of Operation Astute. The battle group was established in September 2006.

== ANZAC as an acronym ==
As well as referring to specific units, the term &quot;ANZAC&quot; also came to refer to soldiers themselves: originally those who participated in the Gallipoli landings, then all Australians and New Zealand soldiers in WWI and now more broadly to all Australian and New Zealander defence personnel. This use is reflected in ANZAC Day, which commemorates both the Gallipoli landings specifically and all Australian and New Zealand soldiers that have served or died in wars more broadly. 

During WWI, the term also referred to the location of the Gallipoli landings, in what is now known as Anzac Cove (also called simply &quot;Anzac&quot; at the time). Another use of the term is for Anzac biscuits, a kind of biscuit that is derived from those sent to soldiers during WWI. 

=== Legal protection ===
The term &quot;ANZAC&quot; is protected through domestic legislation in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom and internationally in all of the 180 countries that are members of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. In Australia, the term cannot be protected as a trademark or design, nor used in trade, business or entertainment or as the name of any boat, residence or vehicle. However, the term may be used with prior approval from the minister for veterans&#x27; affairs when selling Anzac biscuits, where the recipe does not significantly deviate from the traditional recipe and the food is referred to only as &quot;Anzac Biscuits&quot; or &quot;Anzac Slice&quot;, not &quot;Anzac Cookies&quot;. Similar protections exist in New Zealand, under the responsibility of the minister for culture and heritage.

In response to lobbying by the Australian and New Zealand governments, in 1916 the United Kingdom introduced legislation prohibiting the use of the term in trade or business without the approval of the government of Australia or New Zealand. This resulted in the cancellation of around 29 already registered trademarks including &quot;Anzac Motor Company&quot; and &quot;Anzac Soap&quot;. Before the act came into effect, a housing development received much criticism after selecting the name &quot;New Anzac-on-Sea&quot; as a result of a naming competition. The area was ultimately renamed to the current name of &quot;Peacehaven&quot; for reasons unrelated to the use of &quot;Anzac&quot;, as the naming competition fraudulently gave runners-up (practically every person who entered into the competition) the opportunity to buy land in the development that was too small for habitation.

Australia and New Zealand governments were unsuccessful post WWI in persuading other governments to introduce similar restrictions. However, in 2003 the countries successfully applied to register &quot;Anzac&quot; as an &quot;official sign, hallmark or emblem&quot; under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, requiring signatory countries to refuse the registration of &quot;Anzac&quot; under their domestic trademark law.

<doc id="964384" wikidata="Q20645411" url="?curid=964384" title="Teacher in role">
<text>Teacher in Role is an educational technique used especially in the teaching of drama and dramatic literature, however its applications can span across the entire subject spectrum. Educators utilising the technique adopt a character or &#x27;role&#x27;, with the intent of engaging typically younger students in a fictional or historically inspired setting to convey desired concepts, attitudes and ideals.

== Rationale of the Methodology ==

If the role of a teacher is to teach, the role of a student must be to learn. However, it has been agreed that learning is not only an exercise in reading and reciting facts, but in gaining a deeper insight of events and situations. This is where drama becomes an invaluable tool. Through the use of drama and dramatic conventions a teacher does not only teach and learn the &quot;what&quot; but also the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot;.

Drama techniques in education allows students to take a step back out of usual teaching techniques. Students are able to communicate better in conceptual, personal and social levels as they are able to be a listener, speaker and receiver of knowledge. By using role-play, the teacher gives them a way to view and think about a situation using the &quot;implied&quot; behaviour for the role they are given. In turn, the teacher can allow the students to become in charge of their own learning and facilitate them in it. We empower the individual making their expertise greater than our own. Through role-playing, they gain knowledge of what the role entails, and thus insight into the experience and emotions of characters in those circumstances. Additionally, the technique improves personal social techniques in students, like eye contact and gestures.

==Methodology in Practice==
Teachers choose roles carefully in order to engender different interactions and dynamics within the context of the dramatic environment. Adopting different roles in a fictional setting and allowing students to explore the information of the setting through dialogue is an interactive and engaging method of teaching. Teacher-in-role theory highlights particularly the significance of differing status of the role in relation to the role of the students. Differing between a high status character (such as a king) and a low status character (such as a peasant) allows students to explore and engage with a range of differing experiences and emotions. Skilled educators can manipulate these dynamics to supplement teaching theory or larger concepts. Alternatively, the teacher can encourage students to use their own imagination and derive information from implied context behind their own roles. One of the best teacher in roles practices in this manner is a TV talk show interviewing various people (students) from educational books/stories.

==Mantle of the expert==
Mantle of the Expert is a drama in education device designed by Dorothy Heathcote. In Mantle of the Expert, students are in-role as experts in any given area. They cannot be simply told that they are experts, they have to really take on the role, and feel as if they are experts. This can be done through a number of character development games or exercises. The teacher is generally in-role in Mantle of the Expert, and provides a structure upon which the students can build to gradually progress to more independent learning. Mantle of the Expert is described, explained and exemplified in the book &quot;Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote&#x27;s Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education&quot;, by Dorothy Heathcote and Gavin Bolton.

Payne was born in Newark and was a 1952 graduate of Barringer High School. He did his undergraduate studies at Seton Hall University, graduating in 1957. After graduating he pursued post-graduate studies in Springfield College in Massachusetts. Before being elected to Congress in 1988, Payne was an executive at Prudential Financial, Vice President of Urban Data Systems Inc., and a teacher in the Newark Public Schools. In 1970, Payne became the first black president of the National Council of YMCAs. From 1973 to 1981 he was Chairman of the World Y.M.C.A. Refugee and Rehabilitation Committee.

Payne&#x27;s political career began in 1972, when he was elected to the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders, serving three terms.

In 1978, Payne ran against, and came in third to, Peter Shapiro in the June primary selecting the Democratic candidate for the first Essex County Executive, with Sheriff John F. Cryan coming in second.

In 1982, he was elected to the Newark Municipal Council and served three terms, resigning in 1988 shortly after his election to Congress.

===Elections===
As early as 1974, Payne set out to become New Jersey&#x27;s first African-American congressman. He ran against U.S. Congressman Peter Rodino in the 1980 and 1986 Democratic primaries-the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district-but lost both times. Rodino retired in 1988 after 40 years in Congress. Payne defeated fellow Municipal Councilman Ralph T. Grant Jr. by a nearly 4-to-1 margin in the Democratic primary, and was handily elected in November by a nearly 8-to-1 margin. He was re-elected eleven times with no substantive opposition; his lowest margin was 75 percent in 1994.

In the 2002 general election, Payne was reelected with 84.5% of the vote, receiving a higher margin of the vote than in any other New Jersey Congressional race run that year. In 2004, the Republicans didn&#x27;t even put up a candidate, and Payne was reelected with 97% of the vote, against Green Party candidate Toy-Ling Washington and Socialist Workers Party candidate Sara J. Lobman. In 2006, Payne was unopposed in the primary and general elections. In 2008, he won 99% of the vote against Green candidate Michael Taber.

===Tenure===

Payne&#x27;s voting record was considered to have been the most consistently progressive of all New Jersey Congressmen at the time of his death. He was pro-choice and against the death penalty. He was a member, and former chair, of the Congressional Black Caucus and was chosen in 2002 by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to serve on the Democratic Steering Committee. The Democratic Steering Committee chooses which House Committees each individual Democratic Congressmen will serve on and also plays a crucial part in shaping the Democratic legislative agenda. In international issues, Payne was active on issues relating to Africa, particularly regarding the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan and the Western Sahara conflict.

As a leading advocate of education, Payne was instrumental in the passage of key legislation, including the Goals 2000 initiative to improve elementary and secondary schools; the School-to-Work Opportunities Act; the National Service Act, establishment of the National Literacy Institute; and funding for Head Start, Pell Grants, Summer Jobs and Student Loans.

Payne was also a member of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where he served as Chairman of the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health and as a member of the Subcommittee on the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight. Congressman Payne was at the forefront of efforts to restore democracy and human rights in nations throughout the globe. He was one of five members of Congress chosen to accompany President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton on their historic six-nation tour of Africa. He also headed a Presidential mission to war-torn Rwanda to help find solutions to that country&#x27;s political and humanitarian crises. In addition, he was recognized as having the most supportive record in Congress on issues involving the Northern Ireland peace process.

On June 22, 2001 Payne was arrested after protesting against the Sudanese government at its embassy in Washington, D.C. He was a supporter of and endorsed the Genocide Intervention Network.

In 2003, President George W. Bush appointed Payne as one of two members of Congress to serve as a Congressional delegate to the United Nations and reappointed him in 2005 to an unprecedented second term. In this role, he met with the U.N. Secretary General, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and regularly attended sessions of the U.N. General Assembly and other high level meetings.

He was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted to &quot;not&quot; count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election. President George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Payne received an &quot;A&quot; on the liberal Drum Major Institute&#x27;s 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.

Payne served on the board of directors of the National Endowment for Democracy, TransAfrica, Discovery Channel Global Education Fund, the Congressional Award Foundation, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Newark, the Newark Day Center, the Fighting Back Initiative and the Newark YMCA. He received numerous awards and honors from national, international and community-based organizations, including the Visionaries Award bestowed by the Africa Society and the prestigious Democracy Service Medal, which was previously awarded to Lech Walesa, the former Polish President and founder of the Solidarity movement, by the National Endowment for Democracy.

Payne supported Senator Barack Obama in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination after originally supporting Hillary Clinton.

The Donald M. Payne International Development Fellowship is named in his honor.

;Attack in Somalia
On April 13, 2009, Payne&#x27;s plane was departing from Mogadishu, Somalia, when Somali fighters fired mortars at the airport. Payne was unhurt, as his plane was already bound for Kenya. The attack came just one day after Captain Richard Phillips was rescued from Somali pirates after their failed hijacking of the MV &quot;Maersk Alabama&quot;. Payne stated that his party on the plane did not know the airport was attacked until after they arrived in Kenya.

Payne Jr., was president of the Municipal Council of Newark and an Essex County Freeholder-At-Large, and was elected to fill his father&#x27;s seat in Congress on November 6, 2012. His brother, William D. Payne, served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1998 to 2008. His nephew, Craig A. Stanley, served in the General Assembly from 1996 to 2008.

On March 2, 2012, it was reported that Payne had been flown from a hospital in Washington D.C. back to New Jersey via a medical transport plane, because he was &quot;gravely ill&quot;. Payne died four days later, aged 77.

Payne was succeeded in Congress by his son, Donald Payne Jr., who served six terms until his death in office from a heart attack in 2024.

<doc id="964395" wikidata="Q17107717" url="?curid=964395" title="Nunica, Michigan">
<text>Nunica is an unincorporated community in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located near the center of Crockery Township in Ottawa County, close to the junction of Interstate 96 (I-96) M-104 and M-231 at . The first white settlers were Manley Patchin in 1836 and William Hathaway, Jr., in 1839. Hathaway became the first postmaster of Crockery Creek on February 7, 1848. The name of the post office was changed to Nunica on January 8, 1859. The settlement was first platted by Henry Ernst in 1865. The name Nunica is derived from the Native American word &quot;menonica&quot;, meaning &quot;clay earth&quot;, from which pottery was made. This clay was also the origin for the name of Crockery Creek. The Nunica ZIP code 49448 serves most of Crockery Township, as well as portions of Sullivan Township in Muskegon County to the north and small areas of Polkton Township to the east.

==Demographics==
==History==
The Nunica vicinity has been inhabited by the Ottawa Native Americans for centuries. The name means &quot;clay earth&quot;.

The first European explorers in the Ottawa County region were the French-Canadian explorers Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette who passed through the region in the mid 17th century. European settlement in the area proceeded slowly until the mid-19th century, when zinc was discovered in nearby Crockery Creek in 1858. In 1872, the town of Nunica was officially incorporated, the name taken from the Ottawa word for zinc. The 1880 census showed approximately 1,000 settlers in the region.

Nunica experienced rapid growth in population in the early 20th century as settlers came to the region to mine zinc and farm. The settlement process was aided by the Grand Haven–Detroit branch of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad on which Nunica was an important stop. The 1920 census shows Nunica at the peak of its population, with 8,000 citizens.

By 1924 the zinc ore in the region had been completely exhausted. Coupled with a particularly severe influenza outbreak in 1927 that claimed the lives of nearly 800 people from the town, the population of Nunica declined. The 1930 census shows the population of Nunica as 5,000.

In 1935 nearly one-third of Nunica was destroyed by fire, in what became known locally as the great Nunica fire. It is speculated that the fire began when the Nunica train station was struck by lightning. In either case, the train station that had served as the main source of livelihood for the town was completely destroyed, along with such forgotten landmarks as the Nunica Conservatory for Music and other Fine Arts and the Nunica casino. None of these landmarks were ever rebuilt. In addition, nearly of farmland were completely destroyed.

Since the train station was never rebuilt, Nunica never recovered from the devastating fire and the population went into freefall. By 1950 there were only 1,000 citizens in the greater Nunica area. In 1957 the town was unincorporated. The current population of Nunica is estimated at 400.

A new highway has been built near the Nunica area just off I-96. M-231 has been built as a two-lane freeway so it can relieve traffic congestion at the U.S. Highway 31 drawbridge in Grand Haven. This highway was completed on October 30, 2015.

<text>Dramatic conventions are the specific actions and techniques the actor, writer or director has employed to create a desired dramatic effect or style.

A &quot;dramatic convention&quot; is a set of which both the audience and actors are familiar with and which act as a useful way of quickly signifying the nature of the action or of a character.

All forms of theatre have dramatic conventions, some of which may be unique to that particular form, such as the poses used by actors in Japanese kabuki theatre to establish a character, or the stock character of the black-cloaked, mustache-twirling villain in early cinema melodrama serials.

It can also include an implausible facet of a performance required by the technical limitations or artistic nature of a production and which is accepted by the audience as part of suspension of disbelief. For example, a dramatic convention in Shakespeare is that a character can move downstage to deliver a soliloquy which be heard by the other characters on stage nor are characters in a musical surprised by another character bursting into song. One more example would be how the audience accepts the passage of time during a play or how music will play during a romantic scene.

Dramatic conventions may be categorized into groups, such as rehearsal, technical, or theatrical.
Rehearsal conventions can include hot seating, roles on the wall, and still images. Technical conventions can include lighting, dialogue, monologue, set, costuming, and entrances/exits. Theatrical conventions may include split focus, flashback/flashforward, narration, soliloquy, and spoken thought.

All categories of dramatic conventions may be used in creative drama to support educators teaching dramatic arts. &quot;Jonothan Neelands and Tony Goode note that the experience of drama requires teachers to use forms and structures that engage both the intellect and emotions in making and representing collaborative meaning. [...] As you work in drama, you will discover other modes of representing meaning and your repertoire of ideas for containing and shaping the work will expand and become refined.&quot; Educators use dramatic conventions in integrated and cross-curricular instruction – particularly literacy and the humanities – to make meaningful educational experiences for students.

<text>My Arms, Your Hearse is the third studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth, released in August 1998. It was the band&#x27;s first album to be released simultaneously in Europe, through Candlelight Records, and in the United States, through Century Black.

==Background==
&quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; was the first Opeth album with drummer Martin Lopez, who answered a newspaper ad that Opeth put up searching for this spot to be taken after Anders Nordin left. Shortly thereafter the band also brought in Martín Méndez, a friend and previous bandmate of Lopez. However, Mendez did not have enough time to learn the bass parts for the album, so frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt played bass for the entire recording session. All of the songs on &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; are shorter than ten minutes, whereas on Opeth&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Morningrise&quot;, every song exceeds this length. The album is dedicated to Lee Barrett (of Candlelight Records).

The title of the album is derived from the lyrics of the song &quot;Drip, Drip&quot; by the band Comus.

==Concept==
Åkerfeldt wrote all the lyrics before the music was written, to create Opeth&#x27;s first concept album. Each song ends with the title of the next song. For example, &quot;April Ethereal&quot; ends with the word &quot;when&quot;, which is the name of the next track.

== Artwork ==
The cover of this album was captured by their then-guitarist Peter Lindgren. The original picture was taken in late 1997, somewhere in Sweden. The effects were added later on. The figure seen in the middle is Lindgren&#x27;s girlfriend in a costume with makeup on.

==Reception==
&quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; was widely praised by critics. Steve Huey of AllMusic said that it &quot;flows logically from one composition to the next, and the mostly long songs have enough variation in texture and mood to hold the listener&#x27;s interest fairly consistently&quot;. Jeb of &quot;Metal Faith&quot; magazine said, &quot;each song sort of flows into the next giving the whole album a unified feel&quot;. Jeff of &quot;Mid West Metal&quot; magazine commented, &quot;having never been exposed to Opeth, I had them pegged as a typical black metal bands that sings about love and relationships and crap like that. I really didn&#x27;t expect to get blown out of the water when &#x27;April Ethereal&#x27; kicked in, from this point I am converted! And while the album has some mellow parts and some folk-ish characteristics, it&#x27;s still a very intense album from a band who seems to have not forgotten how the fuck they got their current plateau in life.&quot; Christian Renner of &quot;Metal Crypt&quot; wrote, &quot;the musicianship is brilliant as always and the songwriting is just what you would expect from this incredibly talented group. This is another great album that most bands out there would give their right arm to have written and that statement just speaks volumes of the songwriting talent of the Åkerfeldt/Lindgren team.&quot; Pedro Azevedo of &quot;Chronicles of Chaos&quot; said of the album, &quot;though some parts of the drum sound are somewhat awkward at times (new drummer and bass player, by the way), the instrumental performance is as great as one would expect, and Akerfeldt&#x27;s vocals are again amazing. Top quality sections just flow throughout the album, making it truly -excellent-. &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; is a indeed a brilliant proof that Swedish metal isn&#x27;t entirely stagnant.&quot; &quot;Tartarean Desire&quot;&#x27;s critic Cseke Róbert wrote, &quot;this record is more powerful and more beautiful than most of today&#x27;s music from this genre. The entire record is a mixture of hell-bound adrenalin and soul... &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; is such a powerful album that I consider it one of the best of the genre.&quot; Demonic Tutor (Olivier Espiau) of &quot;Metal Storm&quot; stated the album is a &quot;trip to heaven&quot; and also:
Tim Henderson of &quot;Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles&quot; said &quot;you are in for a treat, easily described as the black metal version of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; in all its pride and glory. In fact, if Gilmour joined Emperor, or if Cradle took sides with Yes, can &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; be truly described&quot;. &quot;&quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; is a milestone in &#x27;90s extreme metal&quot;, wrote Chris Bruni in his review for &quot;Unrestrained!&quot; magazine. He also wrote that the album is &quot;easily their most stunning achievement&quot; and &quot;the songs are stronger, heavier, more cohesive, with a stronger sound courtesy of Studio Fredman, and the textures and song movements are some of the best executed structures to be heard in metal&quot;.

<text>William Beck Ochiltree (October 18, 1811 – December 27, 1867), was a settler, judge, and legislator in Texas. In 1963, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark Number 967, honoring Colonel Ochiltree, was placed at the courthouse in Perryton.

==Biography==
He was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina; his family lived for a time in Florida and after 1820 in Alabama, where Ochiltree began practicing law. In 1839 he moved to Nacogdoches, Texas, and continued his practice. During the years of the Republic of Texas, he was a judge of the Fifth Judicial District, secretary of the treasury in 1844, adjutant general in 1845, and delegate to the Convention of 1845.

After the annexation of Texas by the United States, he was a representative in the Sixth Texas Legislature in 1855 and delegate to the Secession Convention in 1861. He was elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States but resigned after a short time to return to Texas and raise a regiment.

Poor health forced him to resign that post in 1863. He subsequently lived at Jefferson until his death.

<text>Robert Baker Dairyu Chotan Aitken Rōshi (June 19, 1917 – August 5, 2010) was a Zen teacher in the Harada-Yasutani lineage. He co-founded the Honolulu Diamond Sangha in 1959 with his wife, Anne Hopkins Aitken. Aitken received Dharma transmission from Koun Yamada in 1985 but decided to live as a layperson. He was a socialist and anarchist who advocated for social justice for homosexuals, women and Native Hawaiians throughout his life, and was one of the original founders of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.

==Biography==

Robert Aitken or Bob, as he liked to be called, was born to Robert Thomas Aitken and Gladys Page Baker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1917. He was raised in Hawaii from the age of five. He was the son of a war enthusiast and was a rebel and loner in the 1930s and 40s before the war.

Living in Guam as a civilian working in construction—at the onset of World War II—he was detained by the Japanese and held in internment camps for the duration of the war. A guard at one of the internment camps let him borrow a copy of R.H. Blyth&#x27;s book &quot;Zen in English Literature and the Oriental Classics.&quot; In one of his books later on in his life, he described being so invested in the book that he managed to be joyful even in the terrible conditions. In another internment camp in Kobe, Japan, in 1944 he met its author, Reginald Horace Blyth, with whom he had frequent discussions on Zen Buddhism and anarchism. At the conclusion of the war he returned to Hawaii and obtained a B.A. in English literature and an MA in Japanese from the University of Hawaii. He would write for two hours each morning and even read aloud his work to make sure it was his distinctive style.

In the late 1940s, while briefly attending classes at the University of California in Berkeley, California, he met Nyogen Senzaki. Originally in California hoping for an encounter with Krishnamurti, he began to study with Senzaki in Los Angeles. During this period he became more vocal about his commitment to leftist social issues such as pacifism and labor rights. He was investigated by the FBI as a result of his advocacy work. Aitken decided to not pay the portion of his taxes that went to the Defense Department of the U.S because he opposed the war in Vietnam and arming the military.

In 1950, Aitken returned to Japan, under a grant to study haiku and followed Senzaki&#x27;s recommendation that he study Zen. There he took part in his first sesshin at Engaku-ji, a temple in Kamakura, Japan. Soon after, he met Nakagawa Soen, who persuaded him to come for a stay at Ryutakuji for the next seven months. During this period Soen took over for the ailing abbot of the temple, Yamamoto Gempo. Aitken then developed dysentery, and returned home to Hawaii. He married his second wife Anne Hopkins in 1957 and made occasional trips back to Japan. In 1957 Aitken met Hakuun Yasutani and sat with him for the first time.

In 1959 he and Anne began a meditation group in Honolulu at their residence, which became known as the Koko-an zendo. The community that gathered at this zendo were then named the Diamond Sangha by the two. The Diamond Sangha has affiliate zen centers in South America, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Europe and is known for making the rigors of traditional Zen accessible to lay practitioners.

In 1960 Soen Nakagawa Roshi asked young monk Eido Tai Shimano to travel to Honolulu to assist at the Diamond Sangha center.

In 1961, Aitken made an extended stay in Japan to study under Haku&#x27;un Yasutani, eventually ending his studies with Soen. He then worked in various capacities at the East-West Center and the University of Hawaii until 1969, when he and Anne moved to Maui, Hawaii, to found the Maui Zendo in Haiku-Pauwela. Koun Yamada Rōshi was invited to lead the Diamond Sangha and he moved to Hawaii in 1971. In 1974 Aitken was given permission to teach by Koun Yamada, receiving full Dharma transmission from him in 1985.

He also was a major inspiration for the ‘System Stinks’ movement, where they drew inspiration from his famous photograph protesting with a sign. In the picture the sign said &#x27;The System Stinks&#x27; and was in protest of the Iraq War, while in his wheelchair. The photo was taken in Hawaii.

Robert Aitken was a social activist through much of his adult life, beginning with protesting against nuclear testing during the 1940s. He was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War, and became a strong opponent of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. He was among the earlier proponents of deep ecology in religious America, and was outspoken in his beliefs on the equality of men and women. In 1978 Aitken helped found the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, an organization that advocates conflict resolution globally. In the discussion that led to the founding of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, most of the other people had less experience than him when it came to political activism. This gave him the most influence on what the organization should be about. Many of the first 100 people who were sent invitations to join were recommendations from Robert Aitken. He was also the guest speaker at the first two institutes that the Buddhist Peace Fellowship held. He did have anarchist beliefs, which is why even when he helped found the organization, he didn&#x27;t take any control due to distrusting all authority or control even when it was his own.

Aitken Roshi retired in 1996 and spent some of his final years in Palolo, Hawaii, where he could be looked after and interact with some of his students. He died after a brief bout with pneumonia on August 5, 2010, in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was working on his fourteenth book before his passing.

<text>The  (; Polish for &#x27;anchor&#x27;) was an emblem of the Polish Underground State and (AK; &#x27;Home Army&#x27;) used during World War II. It was created in 1942 by members of the Wawer minor sabotage unit within the AK, as an easily usable emblem for the struggle to regain the country&#x27;s independence. The initial meaning of the initialism &quot;PW&quot; was (We shall avenge Wawer), in reference to the 1939 Wawer massacre, which was considered to be one of the first large scale massacres of Polish civilians by German troops in occupied Poland.

At first, Polish scouts from sabotage units painted the whole phrase upon walls. However, it was soon abbreviated to PW, which came to symbolise the phrase (fighting Poland). In early 1942, the AK organised a contest to design an emblem to represent the resistance movement, and the winning design by Anna Smoleńska, a member of the Gray Ranks who herself participated in minor sabotage operations, combined the letters P and W into the . Smoleńska was arrested by the Gestapo in November 1942, and died in Auschwitz in March 1943, at the age of 23.

==History==
The was first painted on walls in Warsaw on 20 March 1942 by Polish boy scouts, as a psychological warfare tactic against the occupying Germans. On 27 June, it was used for a new form of minor sabotage: in order to commemorate the day of the patron saint for President Władysław Raczkiewicz and commander-in-chief Władysław Sikorski, members of the AK stamped several hundred copies of the German propaganda newspaper with the . This would become an annual event during the occupation: only 500 papers were defaced in the first year, but this the number grew to 7,000 the year after.

On 18 February 1943, General Stefan Rowecki, commander of the AK, issued an order specifying that all sabotage, partisan and terrorist actions be signed with the . On 25 February, , the official press outlet of the AK, called the &quot;the sign of the underground Polish Army&quot;. The emblem gained enormous popularity and became recognised throughout the country. By the later stages of the war, most of the political and military organisations within Poland had adopted it as a symbol, even those not linked to the AK. It was painted on city walls, stamped on German banknotes and postage stamps, and printed on the headers of underground newspapers and books. It also became one of the symbols of the Warsaw Uprising, as &quot;PW&quot; is also an initialism for and .

After the war, Poland&#x27;s communist regime banned the , although it continued to be used abroad by associations of former AK members living in exile. Prohibition on the emblem&#x27;s use was relaxed in the later years of communist rule, and in 1976 it became one of the symbols of (ROPCiO), an anti-communist organisation defending human rights in Poland. It was also adopted by other anti-communist political organisations, ranging from the rightist Confederation of Independent Poland (KPN) of Leszek Moczulski to Fighting Solidarity, an organisation formed in response to the de-legalisation of the independent trade union Solidarity and government repression of opposition after martial law was declared in 1981.

<doc id="964425" wikidata="Q1523643" url="?curid=964425" title="Live in Japan (George Harrison album)">
<text>Live in Japan is a live double album by the English musician George Harrison, released in July 1992. Credited to &quot;George Harrison with Eric Clapton and Band&quot;, it was Harrison&#x27;s second official live album release, after 1971&#x27;s Grammy-winning &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;. The album was recorded during his Japanese tour backed by Eric Clapton in December 1991, and it contains live versions of Harrison&#x27;s work as a solo artist alongside many of his best-known Beatles songs. Aside from the 2001 reissue of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, with previously unavailable bonus tracks, &quot;Live in Japan&quot; was Harrison&#x27;s last release before his death in November 2001.

==History==

In 1991, a year after releasing the second Traveling Wilburys album, &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3&quot;, Harrison was persuaded by close friend Eric Clapton to tour Japan with him. Although mindful of his troubled 1974 North American tour for &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, Harrison performed a series of well-received shows in December 1991, which also featured a short set of Clapton&#x27;s songs. The experience proved to be an enjoyable one for Harrison, whose set list included a variety of his Beatles-era songs alongside selections from his solo career. It would end up being his final tour before his death, though he had more tours planned.

==Release==
A double album, &quot;Live in Japan&quot; was issued in July 1992, with production credited to &quot;Spike and Nelson Wilbury&quot;, Harrison&#x27;s two personæ on the Traveling Wilburys releases. The live album failed to chart in the United Kingdom and debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 126, its peak position in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard/AM&quot;&gt;&quot;Awards: George Harrison &quot;Live in Japan&quot;&quot;, AllMusic (retrieved 20 November 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The album reached number 15 on Japan&#x27;s Oricon chart.

It was out of print for many years afterwards until 2004, when &quot;Live in Japan&quot; was remastered and reissued, both separately and as part of the deluxe box set &quot;The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992&quot;, on Dark Horse with new distribution by EMI. The release offered a bonus SACD 5.1 surround sound remix alongside the original.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine described &quot;Live in Japan&quot; as &quot;a skin-tinglin&#x27; romp, delicious and indispensable&quot; in which &quot;several renditions surpass the originals&quot;. The reviewer praised Clapton&#x27;s playing and found Harrison&#x27;s singing &quot;splendidly nuanced throughout&quot; before concluding: &quot;A portable, utterly fab house party; just add plenty of room to dance.&quot; Conversely, Billy Altman wrote in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;: &quot;you&#x27;d need a case of Coke to crack the crust on Harrison, who sounds so woefully out of shape (he&#x27;s continually either short of breath or struggling instrumentally to keep the tempo) that it&#x27;s a wonder no medical advisers are listed in the credits … The lone shining moment belongs to Clapton, whose solo on &#x27;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#x27; is perhaps even more spectacular than the one he played on the original …&quot;

In a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in which he considered Harrison&#x27;s live album in the context of other Beatles-related releases, 22 years after the band&#x27;s break-up, Parke Puterbaugh wrote: &quot;by and large this is a rocking, extroverted performance, and that is where Clapton and band, providing a solid foundation, helped firm up Harrison&#x27;s repertoire and resolve. From the sprung rhythms and tart slide licks of &#x27;Old Brown Shoe&#x27; to the crunching satire of &#x27;Devil&#x27;s Radio,&#x27; it is a pleasure to hear a pair of past masters bring out the best in each other.&quot;

Writing for MusicHound, Roger Catlin views &quot;Live in Japan&quot; as &quot;a remarkable live set, featuring Harrison … playing a repertoire that blends the best of his Beatles writing with his solo material&quot;. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as a &quot;fine double-disc set&quot; on which Harrison &quot;turns in surprisingly strong versions of his best solo material&quot;. Erlewine adds: &quot;it easily surpasses Paul McCartney&#x27;s double-disc &quot;Tripping the Live Fantastic&quot; or &quot;Paul Is Live&quot;. Not bad for a guy who doesn&#x27;t like to give concerts.&quot;

<text>A scale or balance is a device used to measure weight or mass. These are also known as mass scales, weight scales, mass balances, massometers, and weight balances.

The traditional scale consists of two plates or bowls suspended at equal distances from a fulcrum. One plate holds an object of unknown mass (or weight), while objects of known mass or weight, called &quot;weights&quot;, are added to the other plate until mechanical equilibrium is achieved and the plates level off, which happens when the masses on the two plates are equal. The perfect scale rests at neutral. A spring scale will make use of a spring of known stiffness to determine mass (or weight). Suspending a certain mass will extend the spring by a certain amount depending on the spring&#x27;s stiffness (or spring constant). The heavier the object, the more the spring stretches, as described in Hooke&#x27;s law. Other types of scales making use of different physical principles also exist.

Some scales can be calibrated to read in units of force (weight) such as newtons instead of units of mass such as kilograms. Scales and balances are widely used in commerce, as many products are sold and packaged by mass.

==Pan balance==
===History===

The balance scale is such a simple device that its usage likely far predates the evidence. What has allowed archaeologists to link artifacts to weighing scales are the stones for determining absolute mass. The balance scale itself was probably used to determine relative mass long before absolute mass.

The oldest attested evidence for the existence of weighing scales dates to the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, with Deben (unit) balance weights, from the reign of Sneferu (c. 2600 BC) excavated, though earlier usage has been proposed. Carved stones bearing marks denoting mass and the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for gold have been discovered, which suggests that Egyptian merchants had been using an established system of mass measurement to catalog gold shipments or gold mine yields. Although no actual scales from this era have survived, many sets of weighing stones as well as murals depicting the use of balance scales suggest widespread usage.

Examples, dating , have also been found in the Indus River valley. Uniform, polished stone cubes discovered in early settlements were probably used as mass-setting stones in balance scales. Although the cubes bear no markings, their masses are multiples of a common denominator. The cubes are made of many different kinds of stones with varying densities. Clearly their mass, not their size or other characteristics, was a factor in sculpting these cubes.

In China, the earliest weighing balance excavated was from a tomb of the State of Chu of the Chinese Warring States Period dating back to the 3rd to 4th century BC in Mount Zuojiagong near Changsha, Hunan. The balance was made of wood and used bronze masses.

Variations on the balance scale, including devices like the cheap and inaccurate &quot;bismar&quot; (unequal-armed scales), began to see common usage by c. 400 BC by many small merchants and their customers. A plethora of scale varieties each boasting advantages and improvements over one another appear throughout recorded history, with such great inventors as Leonardo da Vinci lending a personal hand in their development.

Even with all the advances in weighing scale design and development, all scales until the seventeenth century AD were variations on the balance scale. The standardization of the weights used – and ensuring traders used the correct weights – was a considerable preoccupation of governments throughout this time.
The original form of a balance consisted of a beam with a fulcrum at its center. For highest accuracy, the fulcrum would consist of a sharp V-shaped pivot seated in a shallower V-shaped bearing. To determine the mass of the object, a combination of reference masses was hung on one end of the beam while the object of unknown mass was hung on the other end (see balance and steelyard balance). For high precision work, such as empirical chemistry, the center beam balance is still one of the most accurate technologies available, and is commonly used for calibrating test masses.

However, bronze fragments discovered in central Germany and Italy had been used during the Bronze Age as an early form of currency. In the same time period, merchants had used standard weights of equivalent value between 8 and 10.5 grams from Great Britain to Mesopotamia.

===Mechanical balances===

The balance (also balance scale, beam balance and laboratory balance) was the first mass measuring instrument invented. In its traditional form, it consists of a pivoted horizontal lever with arms of equal lengththe beam or tron and a weighing pan suspended from each arm (hence the plural name &quot;&quot;scales&quot; for a weighing instrument). The unknown mass is placed in one pan and standard masses are added to the other pan until the beam is as close to equilibrium as possible. In precision balances, a more accurate determination of the mass is given by the position of a sliding mass moved along a graduated scale. A decimal balance uses the lever in which the arm for weights is 10 times longer than the arm for weighted objects, so that much lighter weights may be used to weigh heavy object. Similarly a centesimal balance uses arms in ratio 1:100.


Unlike spring-based scales, balances are used for the precision measurement of mass as their accuracy is not affected by variations in the local gravitational field. (On Earth, for example, these can amount to ±0.5% between locations.) A change in the strength of the gravitational field caused by moving the balance does not change the measured mass, because the moments of force on either side of the center balanced beam are affected equally. A center beam balance will render an accurate measurement of mass at any location experiencing a constant gravity or acceleration.

Very precise measurements are achieved by ensuring that the balance&#x27;s fulcrum is essentially friction-free (a knife edge is the traditional solution), by attaching a to the beam which amplifies any deviation from a balance position; and finally by using the lever principle, which allows fractional masses to be applied by movement of a small mass along the measuring arm of the beam, as described above. For greatest accuracy, there needs to be an allowance for the buoyancy in air, whose effect depends on the densities of the masses involved.


To reduce the need for large reference masses, an off-center beam can be used. A balance with an off-center beam can be almost as accurate as a scale with a center beam, but the off-center beam requires special reference masses and cannot be intrinsically checked for accuracy by simply swapping the contents of the pans as a center-beam balance can. To reduce the need for small graduated reference masses, a sliding weight called a poise can be installed so that it can be positioned along a calibrated scale. A poise adds further intricacies to the calibration procedure, since the exact mass of the poise must be adjusted to the exact lever ratio of the beam.

For greater convenience in placing large and awkward loads, a platform can be &quot;floated&quot; on a cantilever beam system which brings the proportional force to a &quot;noseiron&quot; bearing; this pulls on a &quot;stilyard rod&quot; to transmit the reduced force to a conveniently sized beam.
One still sees this design in portable beam balances of 500 kg capacity which are commonly used in harsh environments without electricity, as well as in the lighter duty mechanical bathroom scale (which actually uses a spring scale, internally). The additional pivots and bearings all reduce the accuracy and complicate calibration; the float system must be corrected for corner errors before the span is corrected by adjusting the balance beam and poise. 

====Roberval balance====
In 1669 the Frenchman Gilles Personne de Roberval presented a new kind of balance scale to the French Academy of Sciences. This scale consisted of a pair of vertical columns separated by a pair of equal-length arms and pivoting in the center of each arm from a central vertical column, creating a parallelogram. From the side of each vertical column a peg extended. To the amazement of observers, no matter where Roberval hung two equal weight along the peg, the scale still balanced. In this sense, the scale was revolutionary: it evolved into the more-commonly encountered form consisting of two pans placed on vertical column located above the fulcrum and the parallelogram below them. The advantage of the Roberval design is that no matter where equal weights are placed in the pans, the scale will still balance.

Further developments have included a &quot;gear balance&quot; in which the parallelogram is replaced by any odd number of interlocking gears greater than one, with alternating gears of the same size and with the central gear fixed to a stand and the outside gears fixed to pans, as well as the &quot;sprocket gear balance&quot; consisting of a bicycle-type chain looped around an odd number of sprockets with the central one fixed and the outermost two free to pivot and attached to a pan.

Because it has more moving joints which add friction, the Roberval balance is consistently less accurate than the traditional beam balance, but for many purposes this is compensated for by its usability.

====Torsion balance====

The torsion balance is one of the most mechanically accurate of analog balances. Pharmacy schools still teach how to use torsion balances in the U.S. It utilizes pans like a traditional balance that lie on top of a mechanical chamber which bases measurements on the amount of twisting of a wire or fiber inside the chamber. The scale must still use a calibration weight to compare against, and can weigh objects greater than 120 mg and come within a margin of error +/- 7 mg. Many microbalances and ultra-microbalances that weigh fractional gram values are torsion balances. A common fiber type is quartz crystal.

===Electronic devices===
====Microbalance====

A microbalance (also called an ultramicrobalance, or nanobalance) is an instrument capable of making precise measurements of the mass of objects of relatively small mass: on the order of a million parts of a gram and below.

====Analytical balance====
An analytical balance is a class of balance designed to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an analytical balance (0.1 mg or better) is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance&#x27;s operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically vented balance safety enclosure, which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 μg without fluctuations or loss of product. Also, the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading. Single-pan mechanical substitution balances maintain consistent response throughout the useful capacity, which is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam and thus the fulcrum by subtracting mass on the same side of the beam to which the sample is added.

Electronic analytical scales measure the force needed to counter the mass being measured rather than using actual masses. As such they must have calibration adjustments made to compensate for gravitational differences. They use an electromagnet to generate a force to counter the sample being measured and output the result by measuring the force needed to achieve balance. Such a measurement device is called an electromagnetic force restoration sensor.

====Pendulum balance scales====
Pendulum type scales do not use springs. These designs use pendulums and operate as a balance that is unaffected by differences in gravity. An example of application of this design are scales made by the Toledo Scale Company.

====Programmable scales====
A programmable scale has a programmable logic controller in it, allowing it to be programmed for various applications such as batching, labeling, filling (with check weight function), truck scales, and more.

Another important function is counting, e. g. used to count small parts in larger quantities during the annual stock taking. Counting scales (which can also do just weighing) can range from mg to tonnes.

===Symbolism===

The scales (specifically, a two-pan, beam balance) are one of the traditional symbols of justice, as wielded by statues of Lady Justice. This corresponds to the use in a metaphor of matters being &quot;held in the balance&quot;. It has its origins in ancient Egypt.

Scales also are widely used as a symbol of finance, commerce, or trade, in which they have played a traditional, vital role since ancient times. For instance, balance scales are depicted in the seal of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Trade Commission.

Scales are also the symbol for the astrological sign Libra.

Scales (specifically, a two-pan, beam balance in a state of equal balance) are the traditional symbol of Pyrrhonism indicating the equal balance of arguments used in inducing epoche.

==Force-measuring (weight) scales==
===History===

Although records dating to the 1700s refer to spring scales for measuring mass, the earliest design for such a device dates to 1770 and credits Richard Salter, an early scale-maker. Spring scales came into wide usage in the United Kingdom after 1840 when R. W. Winfield developed the candlestick scale for weighing letters and packages, required after the introduction of the Uniform Penny Post. Postal workers could work more quickly with spring scales than balance scales because they could be read instantaneously and did not have to be carefully balanced with each measurement.

By the 1940s, various electronic devices were being attached to these designs to make readings more accurate. Load cells – transducers that convert force to an electrical signal – have their beginnings as early as the late nineteenth century, but it was not until the late twentieth century that their widespread usage became economically and technologically viable.

===Mechanical scales===
A mechanical scale or balance is used to describe a weighing device that is used to measure the mass, force exertion, tension, and resistance of an object without the need of a power supply. Types of mechanical scales include decimal balances, spring scales, hanging scales, triple beam balances, and force gauges.

====Spring scales====

A spring scale measures mass by reporting the distance that a spring deflects under a load. This contrasts to a &quot;balance&quot;, which compares the torque on the arm due to a sample weight to the torque on the arm due to a standard reference mass using a horizontal lever. Spring scales measure force, which is the tension force of constraint acting on an object, opposing the local force of gravity. They are usually calibrated so that measured force translates to mass at earth&#x27;s gravity. The object to be weighed can be simply hung from the spring or set on a pivot and bearing platform.

In a spring scale, the spring either stretches (as in a hanging scale in the produce department of a grocery store) or compresses (as in a simple bathroom scale). By Hooke&#x27;s law, every spring has a proportionality constant that relates how hard it is pulled to how far it stretches. Weighing scales use a spring with a known spring constant (see Hooke&#x27;s law) and measure the displacement of the spring by any variety of mechanisms to produce an estimate of the gravitational force applied by the object. Rack and pinion mechanisms are often used to convert the linear spring motion to a dial reading.

Spring scales have two sources of error that balances do not: the measured mass varies with the strength of the local gravitational force (by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth), and the elasticity of the measurement spring can vary slightly with temperature. With proper manufacturing and setup, however, spring scales can be rated as legal for commerce. To remove the temperature error, a commerce-legal spring scale must either have temperature-compensated springs or be used at a fairly constant temperature. To eliminate the effect of gravity variations, a commerce-legal spring scale must be calibrated where it is used.

====Hydraulic or pneumatic scale====
It is also common in high-capacity applications such as crane scales to use hydraulic force to sense mass. The test force is applied to a piston or diaphragm and transmitted through hydraulic lines to a dial indicator based on a Bourdon tube or electronic sensor.

===Domestic Weighing Scale===

Electronic digital scales display weight as a number, usually on a liquid crystal display (LCD). They are versatile because they may perform calculations on the measurement and transmit it to other digital devices. On a digital scale, the force of the weight causes a spring to deform, and the amount of deformation is measured by one or more transducers called strain gauges. A strain gauge is a conductor whose electrical resistance changes when its length changes. Strain gauges have limited capacity and larger digital scales may use a hydraulic transducer called a load cell instead. A voltage is applied to the device, and the weight causes the current through it to change. The current is converted to a digital number by an analog-to-digital converter, translated by digital logic to the correct units, and displayed on the display. Usually, the device is run by a microprocessor chip.

====Digital bathroom scale====
A digital bathroom scale is a scale on the floor which a person stands on. The weight is shown on an LED or LCD display. The digital electronics may do more than just display weight, it may calculate body fat, BMI, lean mass, muscle mass, and water ratio. Some modern bathroom scales are wirelessly or cellularly connected and have features like smartphone integration, cloud storage, and fitness tracking. They are usually powered by a button cell, or battery of AA or AAA size.

====Digital kitchen scale====
Digital kitchen scales are used for weighing food in a kitchen during cooking. These are usually lightweight and compact.

====Strain gauge scale====
In electronic versions of spring scales, the deflection of a beam supporting the unknown mass is measured using a strain gauge, which is a length-sensitive electrical resistance. The capacity of such devices is only limited by the resistance of the beam to deflection. The results from several supporting locations may be added electronically, so this technique is suitable for determining the mass of very heavy objects, such as trucks and rail cars, and is used in a modern weighbridge.

====Supermarket and other retail scale====
These scales are used in the modern bakery, grocery, delicatessen, seafood, meat, produce and other perishable goods departments. Supermarket scales can print labels and receipts, mark mass and count, unit price, total price and in some cases tare. Some modern supermarket scales print an RFID tag that can be used to track the item for tampering or returns. In most cases, these types of scales have a sealed calibration so that the reading on the display is correct and cannot be tampered with. In the US, the scales are certified by the National Type Evaluation Program (NTEP), in South Africa by the South African Bureau of Standards, in Australia, they are certified by the National Measurement Institute (NMI) and in the UK by the International Organization of Legal Metrology.

=== Industrial weighing scale ===
An industrial weighing scale is a device that measures the weight or mass of objects in various industries. It can range from small bench scales to large weighbridges, and it can have different features and capacities. Industrial weighing scales are used for quality control, inventory management, and trade purposes.

There are many kinds of industrial weighing scales that are used for different purposes and applications. Some of the common types are:

Weighbridges : A large scale that can weigh trucks, lorries, containers, and other heavy-duty vehicles. They are used in industries like manufacturing, shipping, mining, agriculture, etc

Container Stacker Scale : A container stacker scale is a specialized weighing system designed for accurately measuring the weight of shipping containers. It is typically integrated into the equipment used for loading and unloading containers, such as container handlers or stacker cranes. Container stacker scales provide real-time weight measurements, allowing logistics professionals to ensure that each container is loaded within the specified weight limits. Container stacker scales are used in industries like ports, shipping, and logistics

Forklift scale : A forklift scale is a weighing system that is built into a forklift truck. It allows for the weighing of loads while they are being lifted and transported by the forklift. This eliminates the need for separate weighing operations and reduces the time and labor required for material handling operations. Forklift scales are used in various industries, such as manufacturing, logistics, and shipping.

Material Handler Scale : A Material Handler Scale is a weighing system that is integrated into a material handler machine, such as a grapple or a magnet. It allows for the accurate and efficient weighing of materials while they are being moved, unloaded, or loaded. A Material Handler Scale can be used in various industries, such as scrap, recycling, waste, and port and harbor. A Material Handler Scale can also transfer the weighing information to a cloud service or an ERP system for real-time monitoring and management of material flow.

A pallet jack scale is a device that combines a pallet jack and a weighing scale. It allows you to weigh and move pallets at the same time, saving time and labor. Pallet jack scales are used in various industries, such as manufacturing, logistics, and shipping.

Crane Scale : A crane scale is a device that measures the weight or mass of objects that are suspended from a crane. It has a hook at the bottom and a large display that allows distant viewing. Crane scales are used for various industrial applications, such as manufacturing, shipping, mining, recycling, and more

Wheel Loader Scale : A wheel loader scale is a system that measures the weight of the materials lifted by a wheel loader, a type of heavy machinery used for moving large amounts of earth, sand, gravel, or other materials. A wheel loader scale can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of loading operations, as well as the inventory management and safety of the industries that use them. A wheel loader scale typically consists of a hydraulic sensor, a display unit, and a data management system. The hydraulic sensor is installed in the wheel loader and detects the pressure changes caused by the load. The display unit shows the weight information to the operator and allows them to set target loads, select products and customers, and export data. The data management system can store, analyze, and transmit the weight data to other devices or platforms.

===Testing and certification===

Most countries regulate the design and servicing of scales used for commerce. For example, in the European Union weighing instruments are subject to 2014/31/EU and 2014/32/EU directives. A conformity assessment procedure is carried out before placing the instrument on the market, andv the instruments are verified after a given period of time in member states of the European Union. This has tended to cause scale technology to lag behind other technologies because expensive regulatory hurdles are involved in introducing new designs. Nevertheless, there has been a trend to &quot;digital load cells&quot; which are actually strain-gauge cells with dedicated analog converters and networking built into the cell itself. Such designs have reduced the service problems inherent with combining and transmitting a number of 20 millivolt signals in hostile environments.

Government regulation generally requires periodic inspections by licensed technicians, using masses whose calibration is traceable to an approved laboratory. Scales intended for non-trade use, such as those used in bathrooms, doctor&#x27;s offices, kitchens (portion control), and price estimation (but not official price determination) may be produced, but must by law be labelled &quot;Not Legal for Trade&quot; to ensure that they are not re-purposed in a way that jeopardizes commercial interest. In the United States, the document describing how scales must be designed, installed, and used for commercial purposes is NIST &quot;Handbook 44&quot;. Legal For Trade (LFT) certification usually approve the readability by testing repeatability of measurements to ensure a maximum margin of error of 10%.

Because gravity varies by over 0.5% over the surface of the earth, the distinction between force due to gravity and mass is relevant for accurate calibration of scales for commercial purposes. Usually, the goal is to measure the mass of the sample rather than its force due to gravity at that particular location.

Traditional mechanical balance-beam scales intrinsically measured mass. But ordinary electronic scales intrinsically measure the gravitational force between the sample and the earth, i.e. the weight of the sample, which varies with location. So such a scale has to be re-calibrated after installation, for that specific location, in order to obtain an accurate indication of mass.

====Sources of error====
Some of the sources of error in weighing are:
* Buoyancy – Objects in air develop a buoyancy force that is directly proportional to the volume of air displaced. The difference in density of air due to barometric pressure and temperature creates errors.
* Error in the mass of reference weight
* Air gusts, even small ones, which push the scale up or down
* Friction in the moving components that causes the scale to reach equilibrium at a different configuration than a frictionless equilibrium should occur.
* Settling airborne dust contributing to the weight
* Mis-calibration over time, due to drift in the circuit&#x27;s accuracy, or temperature change
* Mis-aligned mechanical components due to thermal expansion or contraction of components
* Magnetic fields acting on ferrous components
* Forces from electrostatic fields, for example, from feet shuffled on carpets on a dry day
* Chemical reactivity between air and the substance being weighed (or the balance itself, in the form of corrosion)
* Condensation of atmospheric water on cold items
* Evaporation of water from wet items
* Convection of air from hot or cold items
* Gravitational differences for a scale which measures force, but not for a balance.
* Vibration and seismic disturbances

==Hybrid spring and balance scales==
===Elastic arm scale===
In 2014 a concept of hybrid scale was introduced, the elastically deformable arm scale, which is a combination between a spring scale and a beam balance, exploiting simultaneously both principles of equilibrium and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless sliding sleeve. The rod can reach a unique sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve as a consequence of both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the elastic rod. This mass measuring device can also work without a counterweight.

<doc id="964436" wikidata="Q197861" url="?curid=964436" title="Pennsylvania Railroad class GG1">
<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad Class GG1 is a class of streamlined electric locomotives built for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), in the northeastern United States. The class was known for its striking art deco shell, its ability to pull trains at up to 100 mph, and its long operating career of almost 50 years.

Between 1934 and 1943, General Electric and the PRR&#x27;s Altoona Works built 139 GG1s. The GG1 entered service with the PRR in 1935 and later ran on successor railroads Penn Central, Conrail, and Amtrak. The last GG1 was retired by New Jersey Transit in 1983.

Most have been scrapped, but sixteen are preserved in museums.

==Technical information==
===Body and mechanical===
The GG1 was long and weighed . The frame of the locomotive was in two halves joined with a ball joint, allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves. The body rested on the frame and was clad in welded steel plates. The control cabs were near the center of the locomotive on each side of the main oil-cooled transformer and oil-fired train-heating boiler. This arrangement, first used on the PRR&#x27;s Modified P5 class, provided for greater crew safety in a collision and provided for bi-directional operation of the locomotive. Using Whyte notation for steam locomotives, each frame is a 4-6-0 locomotive, which in the Pennsylvania Railroad classification system is a &quot;G&quot;. The GG1 has two such frames back to back, 4-6-0+0-6-4. The related AAR wheel arrangement classification is 2-C+C-2. This means one frame mounted upon a set of two axles unpowered (the &quot;2&quot;) and three axles powered (the &quot;C&quot;) hinged with the ball and socket to another frame of the same design (the +). The unpowered &quot;2&quot; axles are at either end of the locomotive. The GG1 was equipped with a Leslie A200 horn.

===Electrical and propulsion===
A pantograph on each end of the locomotive body was used to collect the 11,000 V, 25 Hz alternating current (AC) from the overhead catenary wires. In operation, the leading pantograph was usually kept lowered and the trailing one raised to collect current, since if the rear pantograph failed it would not strike the forward pantograph. A transformer between the two cabs stepped-down the 11,000 V to the voltages needed for the traction motors and other equipment. Twelve GEA-627-A1 traction motors (AC commutator motors, not AC induction motors) drove the GG1&#x27;s diameter driving wheels on six axles using a quill drive. The power required was such that double traction motors were used, with two motors driving each axle. The traction motors were six-pole field, 400 volts, 25 Hz rated each at . The motors were frame-mounted using quill drives to the sprung driving wheels, providing a flexible suspension system across a relatively-long locomotive frame, which allowed full wheel weight to rest on the rail for good traction regardless of track condition. A series-wound commutator motor&#x27;s speed is increased by increasing the applied voltage to the motor, thus increasing the current through the motor&#x27;s armature, which is necessary for increasing its torque and thus increasing motor speed. The engineer&#x27;s cab had a 21-position controller for applying voltage to the motors. Four unpowered leading/trailing wheels were mounted on each end of the locomotive.

===Steam generation for heating===
In the 1930s, railroad passenger cars were heated with steam from the locomotive. The GG1 had an oil-fired steam generator to feed its train&#x27;s &quot;steam line.&quot;

==History==
Beginning in the late 1910s, the PRR received the FF1, but decided that it was too slow for passenger trains; it was relegated to heavy freight service. In the mid-1920s, it received the L5 electric, which had a third-rail power supply at the time. When the Pennsylvania built the O1 and the P5, it chose the P5 over the O1 for its ability and power on the rails. After a grade-crossing accident with the P5a, the cab was moved to the center and was designated P5a(Modified). The P5a’s rigid frame did not track well at high speeds, and began developing cracks. PRR still searched for the ultimate electric. Soon enough, the Pennsylvania was in luck and found two contacts as early as 1932. The mechanical design of the GG1 was based largely on the EP3, which the PRR had borrowed from the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad to compare it to the P5a. In 1933, the PRR decided to replace its P5a locomotives; it asked General Electric and Westinghouse to design prototype locomotives with a lighter axle load and more power than the P5a, a top speed of at least , a streamlined body design, and a single (central) control cab.

Both companies delivered their prototypes to PRR in August 1934. Westinghouse&#x27;s R1 was essentially &quot;little more than an elongated and more powerful version of the P5a&quot; with an AAR wheel arrangement of 2-D-2. General Electric delivered its GG1. Both locomotives were tested for ten weeks in regular service between New York and Philadelphia and on a test track in Claymont, Delaware. PRR chose the GG1 because the R1&#x27;s rigid wheelbase prevented it from negotiating sharp curves and some railroad switches. On November 10, 1934, the railroad ordered 57 locomotives: 14 assembled by General Electric in Erie, 18 by the PRR&#x27;s own Altoona Works, and 20 more in Altoona with electrical components from Westinghouse in East Pittsburgh and chassis from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone. An additional 81 locomotives were built at Altoona between 1937 and 1943.

On January 28 1935, to mark the completion of electrification of the line from Washington, D.C., to New York City, PRR ran a special train hauled by Pennsylvania Railroad 4800 before it opened the line for revenue service on February 10. It made a round-trip from D.C. to Philadelphia; it completed the return leg in a record 1 hour and 50 minutes.

In 1945, a Pennsylvania GG1 hauled the funeral train of President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Washington Union Station to New York Pennsylvania Station.

In the mid-1950s, with declining demand for passenger train service, GG1s 4801–4857 were re-geared for a maximum speed of and placed in freight service. They initially retained their train-heating steam generator, and were recalled to passenger service for holiday-season mail trains and &#x27;Passenger Extras&#x27; such as those run for the annual Army–Navy football game in Philadelphia.
Timetable speed limit for the GG1 was 75-80 mph until October 1967, when some were allowed 100 mph for a couple of years. When Metroliner cars were being overhauled in the late 1970s, GG1s were again allowed 100 mph for a short time when hauling Amfleet cars on trains scheduled to run 226.6 miles from New York to Washington in 3 hours and 20 to 25 minutes.

On June 8, 1968, two Penn Central GG1s hauled Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s funeral train from New York Penn Station to Washington, D.C.

===Shell design===
The first designer for the GG1 project was industrial designer Donald Roscoe Dohner, who produced initial scale-styling models, although the completed prototype looked somewhat different. At some point, PRR hired famed industrial designer Raymond Loewy to &quot;enhance the GG1&#x27;s aesthetics.&quot;
The final design is retrospectively &#x27;Art Deco&#x27; as we know it today.

Although it was thought until 2009 that Loewy was solely responsible for the GG1&#x27;s styling, Dohner is now understood to have contributed as well. (Dohner&#x27;s GG1 designs influenced the modified P5as, which debuted before the GG1 — not, as was thought, the other way around.) Loewy did claim that he recommended the use of a smooth, welded body instead of the riveted one used in the prototype. Loewy also added five gold pinstripes and a Brunswick green paint scheme.

In 1952, the paint scheme was changed to Tuscan red; three years later, the pinstripes were simplified to a single stripe and large red keystones were added.

===Incidents===
On September 6, 1943, the &quot;Congressional Limited&quot; crashed at Frankford Junction, in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The train was pulled by GG1 4930. The accident was caused by a journal box fire (a hot box) on the front of the seventh of the train&#x27;s 16 cars. The journal box seized and an axle snapped, catching the underside of the truck and catapulting the car upwards. It struck a signal gantry, which peeled off its roof along the line of windows &quot;like a can of sardines&quot;. Car #8 wrapped itself around the gantry upright in a figure U. The next six cars were scattered at odd angles over the tracks, and the last two cars remained undamaged. In total, 79 passengers died, all from cars #7 and #8, and 117 were injured, some seriously.

On January 15, 1953, train 173, the overnight &quot;Federal&quot; from Boston, was approaching Washington behind GG1 4876. The train passed a signal north of Washington Union Station between , and the engineer decreased the throttle and started applying the brakes. When the engineer realized that the train was not slowing down, and applying the emergency brake had no effect, he sounded the engine&#x27;s horn. A signalman, hearing the horn and noting the speed of the 4876, phoned ahead to the station master&#x27;s office. 4876 negotiated several switches at speeds well over the safe limits and entered the station at around . The train demolished the bumping post, continued through the station master&#x27;s office and into the concourse, where it fell through the floor into the station&#x27;s basement. Thanks to the evacuation of the concourse, no one died, either in the station or aboard the train. A temporary floor was erected over the engine, and the hole it created, for the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. 4876 was eventually dismantled, removed from the basement and reassembled with a new frame and superstructure in Altoona. The reconstructed 4876 survives at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore.

The accident was determined to have been caused by a closed &quot;angle cock&quot;, a valve on the front and rear of all locomotives and rail cars used in the train&#x27;s airbrake system, on the rear of the third car in the train. The handle of the angle cock had been improperly placed and had contacted the bottom of the car. Once it was closed, the air brake pipe on all the cars behind the closed valve remained at full pressure, keeping the brakes released on those cars while the brakes on the locomotive and first three cars were applied in emergency.

The only major electro-mechanical breakdown of the GG1 was caused by a February 1958 blizzard that swept across the northeastern United States and put nearly half of the GG1s out of commission. Exceptionally fine snow, caused by the extreme low temperatures, passed through the traction motors&#x27; air filters and into the electrical components. When the snow melted, it short-circuited the components. On about 40 units, the air intakes were later moved to a position under the pantographs.

===Disposition===
In 1968, the PRR, with its 119 surviving GG1s, merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central. Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970 and its freight operations were later assumed by government-controlled Conrail, which used 68 GG1s in freight service until the end of electric freight traction in 1980. 

After its creation in 1971, Amtrak purchased 30 GG1s for $50,000 each and leased another 21, of which 11 were for use on New York and Long Branch commuter trains. Amtrak initially renumbered the purchased GG1s as Nos. 900 to 929; later the railroad added a prefixed &quot;4&quot;. This replicated some of the numbers of the leased units, which were renumbered 4930 to 4939, except 4935, which kept its old PRR/PC number.

Amtrak unsuccessfully attempted to replace the GG1s in 1975 with the General Electric E60. An E60 derailed during testing at , forcing an investigation (the E60 used the same trucks as the P30CH diesel then in service with Amtrak) that delayed acceptance. The hoped-for service speed was never achieved (timetable limit was 90 mph, then 80, then 90).

A replacement was finally found after Amtrak imported and tested two lightweight European locomotives: X995, an Rc4a built by ASEA of Sweden, and X996, a French design. The railroad picked the ASEA design, initially nicknamed the &quot;Swedish swifty&quot; or the &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and later often referred to as the &quot;Swedish Meatball&quot;. Electro-Motive Diesel, then a part of General Motors, was licensed to build a derivative called the AEM-7. As AEM-7s arrived, Amtrak finally ended GG1 service on April 26, 1980.

The last GG1s in use were some of the 13 assigned to New Jersey Transit (#4872–4884) for its North Jersey Coast Line between New York and South Amboy (the former New York and Long Branch) that ran until October 29, 1983, thus retiring the locomotive after 49 years of service.

==Preservation==
Fifteen production locomotives and the prototype were preserved in museums. None are operational; their main transformers were removed because of the PCBs in the insulating oil.

==In popular culture==
During the mid-1930s, many railroads streamlined locomotives and passenger cars to convey a fashionable sense of speed. While the Union Pacific had the M-10000 and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad the &quot;Zephyr&quot;, the PRR had the GG1. The GG1 has &quot;shown up over the years in more advertisements and movie clips than any other locomotive.&quot; It was also featured in art calendars provided by PRR, which were used to &quot;promote its reputation in the public eye.&quot;

PRR-painted GG1s appear in the films &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; in 1941, &quot;The Clock&quot; in 1945, &quot;Blast of Silence&quot; in 1961, the 1962 version of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, and &quot;Avalon&quot; in 1990. Two GG1s appear in the 1973 film &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot;—a black Penn Central locomotive and a silver, red and blue Amtrak locomotive. A Penn Central GG1 also appears in another 1973 film &quot;The Last Detail&quot;. PRR GG1 4821 appears briefly in the 1952 film &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, hauling the Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus into Philadelphia&#x27;s Greenwich Yard, as the movie&#x27;s director Cecil B. DeMille narrates the scene of its arrival. Near the end of the 1951 film &quot;Bright Victory,&quot; GG1 #4849 is shown pulling into the station.

A GG1 and the &quot;Congressional&quot; were featured on a postage stamp as part of the United States Postal Service&#x27;s All Aboard! 20th Century American Trains set in 1999.

The PC games &quot;Railroad Tycoon II&quot;, &quot;Railroad Tycoon 3&quot;, &quot;Train Fever&quot;, &quot;Transport Fever&quot; and &quot;Transport Fever 2&quot; allow players to purchase and operate GG1 locomotive engines on their train routes. The GG1 is also available with the default Trainz Simulator Games in recent years, and is available as add-ons for Railworks, Train Simulator by Dovetail Games and Microsoft Train Simulator. A GG1 in a fictional Soviet color scheme appears as an environmental prop in the 2023 first-person-shooter &quot;Atomic Heart&quot;. 

Model GG1s have been produced in G, O, S, HO, N and Z scales by Rivarossi, Bachmann, Tyco, Lionel, MTH, USA Trains, Kato, Astor, Fine Art Models, Märklin and other manufacturers.

<text>is traditional Japanese paper processed by hand using fibers from the inner bark of the gampi tree, the mitsumata shrub (&quot;Edgeworthia chrysantha&quot;), or the paper mulberry (&quot;kōzo&quot;) bush.

&quot;Washi&quot; is generally tougher than ordinary paper made from wood pulp, and is used in many traditional arts. Origami, shodō, and ukiyo-e were all produced using &quot;washi&quot;. &quot;Washi&quot; was also used to make various everyday goods like clothes, household goods, and toys, as well as vestments and ritual objects for Shinto priests and statues of Buddha. It was even used to make wreaths that were given to winners in the 1998 Winter Paralympics. &quot;Washi&quot; is also used to repair historically valuable cultural properties, paintings, and books at museums and libraries around the world, such as the Louvre and the Vatican Museums, because of its thinness, pliability, durability over 1000 years due to its low impurities, and high workability to remove it cleanly with moisture.

As a Japanese craft, it is registered as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.

== History ==
By the 7th century, paper had been introduced to Japan from China via the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese developed washi by improving the method of making paper in the Heian period. The paper making technique developed in Japan around 805 to 809 was called , a method of adding mucilage to the process of the conventional technique to form a stronger layer of paper fibers. The improved washi came to be used to decorate religious ceremonies such as &quot;gohei&quot;, &quot;ōnusa&quot; (:ja:大麻 (神道)), and &quot;shide&quot; at Shinto shrines, and in the Heian period, washi covered with gold and silver leaf beautifully decorated books such as &quot;Kokin Wakashu&quot;.

In the Muromachi period, washi came to be used as ceremonial origami for samurai class at weddings and when giving gifts, and from the Sengoku period to the Edo period, recreational origami such as orizuru developed. During the Edo period, many books and ukiyo-e prints for the masses made of washi were published using woodblock printing.

== Manufacture ==
&quot;Washi&quot; is produced in a way similar to that of ordinary paper, but relies heavily on manual methods. It involves a long and intricate process that is often undertaken in the cold weather of winter, as pure, cold running water is essential to the production of washi. Cold inhibits bacteria, preventing the decomposition of the fibres. Cold also makes the fibres contract, producing a crisp feel to the paper. It is traditionally the winter work of farmers, a task that supplemented a farmer&#x27;s income.

Paper mulberry is the most commonly used fiber in making Japanese paper. The mulberry branches are boiled and stripped of their outer bark, and then dried. The fibers are then boiled with lye to remove the starch, fat and tannin, and then placed in running water to remove the spent lye. The fibers are then bleached (either with chemicals or naturally, by placing it in a protected area of a stream) and any remaining impurities in the fibers are picked out by hand. The product is laid on a rock or board and beaten.

Wet balls of pulp are mixed in a vat with water and a formation aid to help keep the long fibers spread evenly. This is traditionally &quot;neri&quot;, which is a mucilaginous material made from the roots of the tororo aoi plant, or PEO, polyethylene oxide. One of two traditional methods of paper making (nagashi-zuki or tame-zuki) is employed. In both methods, pulp is scooped onto a screen and shaken to spread the fibers evenly. Nagashi-zuki (which uses neri in the vat) produces a thinner paper, while tame-zuki (which does not use neri) produces a thicker paper.

== Types ==
With enough processing, almost any grass or tree can be made into a washi. Gampi, mitsumata, and paper mulberry are three popular sources.

* : In ancient times, it was called . Ganpishi has a smooth, shiny surface and is used for books and crafts.
* : Kōzogami is made from paper mulberry and is the most widely made type of washi. It has a toughness closer to cloth than to ordinary paper and does not weaken significantly when treated to be water-resistant.
* : Made from &quot;mitsumata&quot;, mitsumatagami has an ivory-colored, fine surface and is used for shodō as well as printing. It has been used to print paper money since the Meiji period and continues to be used today.

== Applications ==

Until the early 20th century, the Japanese used &quot;washi&quot; in applications where Western style paper or other materials are currently used. This is partly because washi was the only type of paper available at that time in Japan, but also because the unique characteristics of washi made it a better material.

&quot;Washi&quot; is also used in watch dials.

<text>The Aero A.12 was a Czechoslovakian biplane light bomber and military reconnaissance aircraft manufactured in small numbers shortly after World War I. Although reminiscent of the Hansa-Brandenburg-designed aircraft that Aero was building during the war under licence as the Ae.10, the A.12 was the company&#x27;s own design. It is perhaps most significant as the direct descendant of the highly successful A.11 and its various derivatives. An example of the type is preserved at the Letecké Muzeum in Kbely.

<text>William James Pascrell Jr. (January 25, 1937 – August 21, 2024) was an American politician who was a U.S. representative from New Jersey from 1997 until his death in 2024. Pascrell was a member of the Democratic Party and a native of Paterson. Before his election to the House of Representatives, Pascrell served in the New Jersey General Assembly for four terms beginning in 1988 and was elected to two terms as mayor of Paterson.

He was initially elected to the House in 1996 representing . In 2012, the 8th district was redistricted into the 9th district. Pascrell defeated fellow Democratic representative Steve Rothman in a primary and was elected to represent the 9th district during the 2012 general election. He served as the representative from the 9th district until his death.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
The grandson of Italian immigrants, William James Pascrell Jr. was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on January 25, 1937, the son of Roffie J. (née Loffredo) and William James Pascrell (originally Pascrelli). He attended St. George&#x27;s Elementary School, and in 1955 graduated from St. John the Baptist High School, where he was elected student council president. He served in the United States Army and United States Army reserves. Pascrell attended Fordham University in New York City and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism and a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy.

Pascrell spent 12 years as a high school teacher in Paramus, New Jersey, teaching several subjects including psychology, before being hired as a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He was appointed to the Paterson Board of Education and served as board president. He also served on Passaic County Community College&#x27;s board of trustees.

==Early political career==
===State assembly===
Pascrell was first elected to office in 1987 when he ran for the New Jersey General Assembly seat, which was vacated by the retiring Vincent O. Pellecchia. He and incumbent Assemblyman John Girgenti retained the District 35 seats for the Democrats by defeating Republican nominees Martin Barnes, a Paterson city councilman, and Robert Angele, who worked in the city housing administration. Pascrell received 34% of the vote, enough to earn him the seat.

Pascrell and Girgenti were reelected in 1989 over Republicans Joaquin Calcines, Jr. and Jose Moore, with Pascrell polling at 36%; however, Girgenti was replaced by Cyril Yannarelli midway through the term when he was appointed to take over for Frank Graves in the State Senate upon his death.

Entering the 1991 election, District 35 was split as Pascrell and Frank Catania, a Republican, were standing for reelection (Catania having won a special election for Girgenti&#x27;s Assembly seat). Pascrell and Catania won re-election, with Pascrell&#x27;s running mate Eli Burgos finishing third and his Paterson rival Martin Barnes fourth.

In 1993, Pascrell and Reverend Alfred E. Steele of Paterson attempted to put Democrats in full control of District 35 again while Catania ran with Paterson&#x27;s Harvey Nutter to try to win the seats for the Republicans. Once again, the incumbents won, with Pascrell as the leading vote-getter at 31%. Catania had a tighter race with Steele.

Pascrell and Steele broke through as a pair and won control of the Assembly seats for the Democrats in 1995. Facing Donald Hayden, who was appointed to the seat after Catania was selected to serve in a state administrative position, and Dennis Gonzalez in the general election, both emerged with significant victories and Pascrell once again topped out at 33%. He eventually became Minority Leader Pro Tempore.

Pascrell resigned from the General Assembly in January 1997 in order to take his seat in the House of Representatives; his replacement was Nellie Pou.

===Mayor of Paterson===
Frank Graves, the mayor of Paterson, died on March 5, 1990. Pascrell faced City Council President Reverend Albert P. Rowe, Passaic County Freeholder Michael Adamo, and former councilman and police officer Roy Griffin in the nonpartisan election. He won 51.4% of the vote and was sworn in on July 1 of that year, while keeping his seat in the General Assembly.

Pascrell ran for a second term in 1994 and faced two challengers, his former District 35 rival Martin Barnes and long-standing Sixth Ward councilman and former mayor Tom Rooney. He won the three-way contest with 46% of the vote.

Pascrell resigned as mayor on January 3, 1997, in order to take his congressional seat. The city council appointed Barnes to replace him.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1996, Pascrell ran for the Democratic nomination in New Jersey&#x27;s Eighth Congressional District. The seat had been reliably Democratic for many years; it had been in Democratic hands without interruption from 1961 to 1995, with Robert A. Roe serving from 1969 until 1993. But in the 1994 Republican Revolution, Republican Bill Martini, a Clifton councilman and Passaic County freeholder, defeated Roe&#x27;s successor, Herbert Klein. Pascrell won the nomination and the seat, defeating the incumbent with 51% of the vote. The district reverted to form, and Pascrell never faced another contest nearly that close again; winning reelection seven more times with at least 62% of the vote.

==== 2012 ====
After redistricting, the existing 8th district was eliminated, and Pascrell&#x27;s home in Paterson was placed in the newly redrawn 9th district. Fellow Democratic congressman Steve Rothman decided to move into the reconfigured 9th and challenge Pascrell in the primary. Rothman&#x27;s home in Fair Lawn had been drawn into a Republican-leaning district against Republican Scott Garrett. Geographically, the new district was more Rothman&#x27;s district than Pascrell&#x27;s. It covered 53% of Rothman&#x27;s former territory and only 43% of Pascrell&#x27;s.

The primary contest devolved into a highly competitive proxy war over Israel. American Arab Forum president Aref Assaf published a column in &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, &quot;Rothman Is Israel&#x27;s Man in District 9&quot;, in which he wrote:

As total and blind support becomes the only reason for choosing Rothman, voters who do not view the elections in this prism will need to take notice. Loyalty to a foreign flag is not loyalty to America&#x27;s [flag].

Pascrell supporters reportedly produced Arabic-language campaign posters encouraging the &quot;Arab diaspora community&quot; to elect Pascrell, &quot;the friend of the Arabs.&quot; The posters called the race &quot;the most important election in the history of the [Arab American] community.&quot;

&quot;Jewish Voice and Opinion&quot; publisher Susan Rosenbluth wrote that &quot;a number of Arab-American constituents have come out with outrageous attacks on Rothman&quot; and &quot;I haven&#x27;t heard a dual loyalty charge for years.&quot; She also sharply criticized Pascrell for remaining silent and refusing to condemn the charges of dual loyalty.

Pascrell defeated Rothman in the June 5 Democratic primary, 31,435 to 19,947, capturing about 61% of the vote.

In the general election, Pascrell faced Rabbi Shmuley Boteach. Pascrell raised more money than any other congressional candidate in the nation in 2012 ($2.6 million) and raised 10 times the sum that Boteach raised. Democrats outnumbered Republicans by a three-to-one margin in the new 9th district. Pascrell won a ninth term by a margin of 73.6% to 25.4%.

===Tenure===

On October 10, 2002, Pascrell was among 81 Democratic House members to vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq.

Pascrell was one of the original members of the Homeland Security Committee, eventually rising to the post of ranking member on the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee. He has a particular interest in fire safety, and authored the bill that created the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which gives federal grants directly to all fire departments, including volunteer fire departments, which he called &quot;the forgotten part of the public safety equation&quot;.

Pascrell was also a member of the House Transportation Committee, where he worked to modernize roads, bridges, airports, and mass transit systems. He secured funding for reconstructing various dangerous New Jersey roads and bridges, including the Route 46 corridor. In addition, he helped craft legislation to renew federal surface transportation programs, providing funding for New Jersey Transit. The legislation concerned projects of rail expansion between Passaic and Bergen counties, bridge construction throughout Route 46, and the establishment of~ a bike-pedestrian path in South Orange.

Pascrell was an Italian American and was outspoken about Italian Americans&#x27; stereotypical representation in shows such as HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. His Italian heritage was questioned by comedian Stephen Colbert of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, who alleged in an interview that Pascrell could not truly be of Italian descent because Italian surnames must end with a vowel. Pressed by Colbert for an example of an Italian surname ending in a consonant, Pascrell responded with &quot;Sole&quot;.

During Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s 2009 Working on a Dream Tour, Pascrell asked the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the practices of Ticketmaster and TicketsNow in regard to sales of tickets to the tour&#x27;s New Jersey shows. He subsequently introduced federal legislation, the &quot;BOSS ACT&quot; (Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert Ticketing), to require primary ticket sellers to disclose how many tickets were being held back from sale, prohibit ticket brokers from buying tickets during the first 48 hours on sale, and prohibit primary ticket sellers, promoters, and artists from entering the secondary market. In 2012, problems again arose during the ticket sales for Springsteen&#x27;s 2012 Wrecking Ball Tour. Ticketmaster said web traffic was 2.5 times its highest level for the year. Shows were selling out within minutes and many tickets at much higher prices appeared on resale websites such as StubHub less than an hour after the onsale time. Pascrell said he would reintroduce the BOSS ACT.

In October 2008, after the death of a young boy in his district who returned to playing football without having fully recovered from a concussion sustained earlier in the season, Pascrell introduced the Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act (ConTACT), which has been endorsed by the National Football League, the National Football League Players Association, and the Brain Injury Association of America. ConTACT brings together a conference of experts to produce a guidelines for the treatment and care of concussions for middle- and high-school students. It also provides funding for schools&#x27; adoption of baseline and post-injury neuropsychological testing technologies.

In 2009, Pascrell was instrumental in the protection of Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park.

In January 2011, in response to the shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords, Pascrell said, &quot;[t]here&#x27;s an aura of hate and elected politicians feed it. Certain people on Fox News feed it.&quot;

On March 12, 2013, Pascrell introduced the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1098; 113th Congress), a bill that would reauthorize appropriations for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projects to reduce the incidence of traumatic brain injury and projects related to track and monitor traumatic brain injuries. He was the co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, which was founded in 2001 and now includes more than 100 members of Congress.

On December 11, 2020, Pascrell, citing the 14th Amendment (§3, specifically), called for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi not to seat Republicans who signed an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief supporting &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot; plaintiff Ken Paxton, Texas Attorney General. This proposal would not seat nearly two-thirds of the Republican representatives of the incoming 117th United States Congress. Pascrell said, &quot;The text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that.&quot;

Pascrell had a mixed record on abortion while in congress. In 1997, Pascrell was one of 77 House Democrats to vote in favor the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. He voted for the legislation again in 2003, when it was signed into law by President George W. Bush. Subsequently, he adopted a stance more supportive of abortion rights. In 2013, Pascrell voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act despite noting that he had &quot;been against any government funding of abortion&quot; throughout his congressional tenure. After the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 2022, he wrote that &quot;it is not the place for a judge or politician to interfere with a woman&#x27;s bodily decision.&quot; In December 2022, he voted in favor of the Puerto Rico Status Act (H.R. 8393), bipartisan legislation that gives the people of Puerto Rico the ability to decide their political future. He voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in January 2023.

Pascrell voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

<doc id="964458" wikidata="Q514298" url="?curid=964458" title="Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)">
<text>Cloud Nine is the eleventh studio album by the English rock musician George Harrison. The album was recorded and released in 1987 after Harrison had taken a five-year hiatus from his career as a solo artist. The hit single &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot; from this album re-established Harrison as a critically acclaimed and commercially significant recording artist. &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; was Harrison&#x27;s final solo studio album to be released during his lifetime; his next album &quot;Brainwashed&quot; was released in 2002, almost a year after his death.

==Background and recording==
Frustrated with the changing musical climate, Harrison suspended his recording career in the early 1980s. Instead of recording, he opted to pursue other interests, including film production with his own company, Handmade Films. The odd soundtrack or charity song would surface during this period, but otherwise, it was a musically silent period for Harrison.

By late 1986, after a substantial break, Harrison felt the desire to make music again. He asked former Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) leader and fellow musician Jeff Lynne to co-produce a new album with him. After writing a round of new compositions (including the songs already contributed to the 1986 film &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot;), Harrison entered his home studio Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames on 5 January 1987 to begin recording his first new commercial album in five years. Having recorded the backing tracks for seventeen songs between January and March, he completed the album&#x27;s overdubs in August 1987.

Besides Harrison and Lynne, other artists involved in the sessions included Jim Keltner and Ringo Starr on drums, Eric Clapton on guitar, and both Gary Wright and Elton John on piano (the latter was recovering from vocal surgery at the time). With new-found enthusiasm, Harrison actively promoted the album.

==Cover art==
The cover features Harrison&#x27;s first American-made guitar, a 1957 Gretsch 6128 Duo Jet that he purchased in Liverpool in 1961. He gave his &quot;old black Gretsch&quot; to his longtime friend Klaus Voormann, who had it for 20 years before Harrison asked for it back. After having it restored, Harrison used the guitar for the &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; cover shoot.

==Release and aftermath==
Harrison&#x27;s cover of Rudy Clark&#x27;s little-known song &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot; quickly reached number 1 in the United States and number 2 in the United Kingdom. It was Harrison&#x27;s first single to top the US charts since &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)&quot; in 1973. A few weeks later, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; was released to high anticipation and a favourable critical reception.

The album went to No. 10 in the UK. In the US, it peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and No. 4 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 200, and achieved platinum status; later, it was number 1 on &quot;Cash Box&quot;″s Top 40 Compact Discs chart.

The &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot; single and its accompanying video re-introduced Harrison to the mainstream, and the Beatles tribute song &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; was a successful follow-up, reaching the top 25 in both the UK and US. The third single taken from the album, &quot;This Is Love&quot;, was a minor hit in the UK.

While the success of &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; was not enough to spur Harrison to tour, it inspired him to continue making music. In the spring of 1988, along with Lynne, he would call up friends Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison and begin a project ultimately realised as the Traveling Wilburys.

In 2004, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; was remastered and reissued by Dark Horse Records (with new distribution by EMI), both separately, and as part of the deluxe box set &quot;The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992&quot;. The reissue included the bonus tracks &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; and &quot;Zig Zag&quot; from the 1986 film &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; (&quot;Zig Zag&quot; had also been released as the B-side of the &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; single).

==Critical reception==

Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Wild described &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; as &quot;an expertly crafted, endlessly infectious record that constitutes Harrison&#x27;s best album since 1970s inspired &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;&quot;. Wild also acknowledged Lynne&#x27;s input as co-producer and praised &quot;When We Was Fab&quot;, &quot;Cloud 9&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s What It Takes&quot;, and &quot;Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; as &quot;sublime pop&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden called the release &quot;crucial&quot; to Harrison&#x27;s career, adding: &quot;A pleasingly tuneful album, its sound is deliberately quaint, as it explicitly evokes the Beatles&#x27; more romantic psychedelic music of the late 1960s.&quot; Although he regretted the inclusion of ballads such as &quot;Breath Away from Heaven&quot;, Bill Holdship wrote in &quot;Creem&quot; that &quot;a good album&#x27;s a good album, and &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; is plenty good … it&#x27;s the best record from a former Beatle in at least seven years.&quot;

Less impressed, Daniel Brogan of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; opined: &quot;&quot;Cloud Nine&quot; plods hopelessly. Most of the blame must fall on Harrison, though producer Jeff Lynne&#x27;s influence is far too prevalent ... The album is occasionally redeemed by the deft guitar interplay between Harrison and Eric Clapton, as well as the perky single &#x27;Got My Mind Set on You.&#x27;&quot; In a five-star review for the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, J.D. Considine wrote: &quot;Forget the &#x27;former Beatle&#x27; stuff – this album would be worth snapping up even if Harrison were some unknown from Encino.&quot; After remarking on Harrison&#x27;s &quot;stellar&quot; cast of backing musicians, Considine added: &quot;But as much as the playing enlivens the material, as with the dark, bluesy guitar riffs that open the title tune, it&#x27;s the writing that deserves credit for this album&#x27;s luster.&quot;

In a 2001 review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also gave the album five stars. He wrote that, with Lynne&#x27;s help and &quot;the focus on … snappy pop-rock numbers&quot;, Harrison &quot;crafted a remarkably consistent and polished comeback effort with &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;&quot;, which Erlewine considered &quot;one of his very best albums&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine/AM2001&quot;&gt;Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra &amp; Stephen Thomas Erlewine (eds), &quot;All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music&quot; (4th edn), Backbeat Books (San Francisco, CA, 2001; ), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2002 posthumous appraisal of Harrison&#x27;s solo career for &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine, Dave Thompson described the album as &quot;littered with highlights&quot;, calling &quot;This Is Love&quot; &quot;a jewel&quot;, and wrote that &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; benefited from Lynne &quot;wringing every last Beatle-esque effect out of his box of sonic tricks&quot;.

Reviewing the 2004 reissue, &quot;Uncut&quot; described &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; as &quot;endowed with undeniable charm&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; deemed it to be a &quot;late-career masterwork&quot; from Harrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloud Nine/CD Universe&quot;&gt;&quot;George Harrison – Cloud Nine CD Album&quot; &gt; Product description . CD Universe/Muze. Retrieved 5 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2011, John Harris found the production dated, but praised the quality of the songs, including the &quot;splendidly gonzo version&quot; of &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot; and the &quot;irresistible&quot; &quot;When We Was Fab&quot;, and considered &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; a &quot;deserved global hit&quot;.

<text>The Scion xA is a five-door subcompact hatchback marketed in the US from 2004-2006 — as an export model of the Japanese domestic market [[Toyota Ist]]. Based on the first generation Toyota Vitz hatchback, the xA shared a platform with the Toyota Platz sedan.

The xA received a minor facelift for the 2006 model year, before importation ended in December 2006. The xA&#x27;s successor, the xD was delivered to US dealerships beginning in August 2007 as a 2008 model.

== Technical data ==
*Engine:
**1.5 L DOHC I4 engine.
**108 hp (81 kW) @ 6000 rpm (revised to 103 SAE net horsepower in 2006)
**105 ft·lbf (142 Nm) of torque @ 4200 rpm (revised to in 2006)
*Platform: NCP61
*Cargo volume: 11.7 ft³ (331 L)
*EPA fuel economy ratings:
*2008 EPA revised fuel economy ratings for the 2004 model are / for both manual and automatic transmission. For the 2005 and 2006 models, fuel economy is estimated at / for vehicles with a manual transmission and / for those with an automatic transmission.
*Drag Coefficient: 0.31
*0-60 mph: 8.8 seconds
*1/4 mile: 16.7 seconds at 
*Top Speed: Limited to 110 mph

Some of the revisions for 2006 include modified bumpers and side skirts, as well as turn signal indicators on the side mirrors and audio controls located on the steering wheel. The xA was also the first production vehicle to offer an optional iPod input with head unit display, as well as a more refined, user-friendly head unit and more exterior colors.
== Release series ==
Beginning in late spring 2004 with the launch of the 2004 Scion xB RS 1.0 (Release Series 1.0) Scion decided to create limited edition vehicles pre-packaged with exclusive accessories in limited quantities. Limited Edition vehicles from a marketing standpoint were used to create a buzz for the brandname, with their exterior colors tending to be loud or bright hues (i.e. orange, yellow, red, blue, green). Because of the growing popularity of the Scion product line and the scarce production runs (most dealers only got 2-3 of each RS model), these limited edition vehicles quickly sell out. Preordering is available at each dealership on a first-come, first-served basis. To the customer&#x27;s benefit, Scion&#x27;s &quot;Pure Price&quot; MSRP binds dealerships against market-demand vehicle mark-up. Naturally, resale values of Release Series vehicles command a premium because of their packaged options and scarcity.

2005

* xA RS 1.0: Available only in Absolutely Red, standard equipment included a sports grille and color-keyed rear spoiler, power Webasto factory moonroof, 6 spoke alloy wheels, color-keyed ground effects and vehicle stability control (VSC). Only 1,550 units were produced

2005

* xA RS 2.0 only available in Spectra Blue Mica with 1,700 units produced

2006

* xA RS 3.0 only available in Stingray Metallic light blue with 2,100 units produced

<text>The Silver Comet Trail is a rail trail in west-northwestern Georgia, United States.

==Route==

The Silver Comet Trail is named for the &quot;Silver Comet&quot; passenger train that traversed the same route from 1947 to 1969. It begins in Smyrna, Georgia, runs west through Cobb, Paulding and Polk counties, and continues as Alabama&#x27;s Chief Ladiga Trail at the state line.

The Silver Comet and Chief Ladiga trails join to form one continuous trail from Smyrna, Georgia to Anniston, Alabama, which together form the second-longest paved rail trail in the U.S.

U.S. Bicycle Route 21 follows a portion of Silver Comet Trail from Cedartown to the east end of the trail. The trail is locally known as an ideal destination for bikers and runners to train or relax. Google map here. Path Foundation&#x27;s map here.

==History==
In 1947, the &quot;Silver Comet&quot; was introduced by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) during the height of passenger rail use. Due to declining ridership, the &quot;Silver Comet&quot; was downgraded in the 1960s, losing its sleeper-lounger cars. In 1969, the &quot;Silver Comet&quot; was downgraded again and finally discontinued in June of that year, by SAL successor Seaboard Coast Line (SCL).

By 1986 SCL had gradually merged with several nearby railroads, forming the Seaboard System, which had become CSX Transportation by July 1987. CSX abandoned of the former &quot;Silver Comet&quot; route from Cobb County through Paulding and Polk counties in 1989. In 1992, the Georgia Department of Transportation initially purchased the former roadbed for future use as a high-speed transit route, but later that year, Ron Griffith, Director of Cobb County Parks, requested a lease agreement between the county and the Georgia DOT to use the rail line as a multi-use trail. The Cobb County Board of Commissioners approved the multi-use trail plan in November.

Construction began in July 1998, with the initial section between Nickajack Creek and Hicks Road opening by that November.

The former SAL/SCL right of way is rail banked. This means at any time in the future, if rail traffic increases to the point where an old line exists, it could be purchased and track put back down. The right of way would thus become a Class 1 railroad again. The former SAL/SCL line is 78 miles shorter than the line CSXT now uses, the former ACL, and Atlanta &amp; West Point lines, which run well south of the former SAL/SCL line.

In September 2019 the James M. Cox Foundation gave $6 million to the PATH Foundation, which will connect the Silver Comet Trail to the Atlanta Beltline. This project has been split into two parts. The PATH Foundation is responsible for the section from the current Silver Comet Trail terminus at the Mavell Road trailhead and then following the abandoned railroad right of way to Plant Atkinson Road. The Cobb DOT is responsible for the section from Plant Atkinson road to the Atlanta Road/Marietta Boulevard bridge over the Chattahoochee river, following an easement along Atlanta Road. Cobb expects to let its section for bid in Spring 2023. PATH&#x27;s section is in flux due to legal challenges from railroad right of way easement holders.

==Economic impact==
In 2013, a detailed study was done on the trail to determine the economic impact of the trail. It was estimated that the trail had 1.9 million uses in 2013. 400,000 of those uses were from out of state. The direct spending of residents and tourists was $57 million. The $118 million economic impact was found to support 1,310 jobs.

The tax revenue generated by the trail was estimated to be about $3.5 million in income tax, sales tax, and business taxes. The study suggested an 4 to 7 increase in property taxes for homes within a quarter mile of the trail, resulting in an increase of $0.5 million in revenue for municipalities and school districts.

==Geology==
In Paulding County, the Silver Comet Trail crosses over the Allatoona Fault; where the trail intersects the fault in the vicinity of Willow Springs Road, the fault serves to divide the distinctive Eastern Blue Ridge rocks from those that most characterize the Western Blue Ridge Province. One rock formation of particular note in Paulding County is the Ordovician-age Pumpkinvine Creek Formation (PCF), primarily composed of metamorphosed volcanic rocks thought to have originated out in the now-vanished, ancient ocean that geologists generally refer to as Iapetus.

The meta-volcanic rocks of the PCF are believed to be remnants of the sort of so-called &quot;accreted terranes&quot; described above, and exposures of PCF rocks can be found on the Silver Comet Trail near the Allatoona Fault.

<text>The Scion xB is a compact car (subcompact car in its first generation) made by Scion, a now-defunct fully owned division of Toyota, for the United States market. It is a box-shaped, 5-door hatchback.


==First generation (XP30; 2003)==

The first-generation xB was a lightly modified and rebadged version of the Japanese-market subcompact Toyota bB. It was a small hatchback based on the Toyota Echo/Yaris platform. The xB was one of two models in the lineup of Toyota&#x27;s US-exclusive Scion division present at the brand&#x27;s 2003 launch, the other being the xA, based on the Toyota Ist. The car proved to be unexpectedly popular with senior drivers.

===First-generation xB vs. first-generation bB===
Only the first-generation models for both the xB and bB are related. Second-generation models are based upon different platforms.

To create the first-generation xB, the bB was modified from right- to left-hand drive, the front passenger area was also changed significantly with the bB&#x27;s front bench seat replaced with bucket seats and the column-mounted shifter changed to a floor-mounted shifter.

The available drivetrains also differed. The bB was available with either the 1.3 L I4 2NZ-FE engine or the 1.5 L 1NZ-FE, mated exclusively to a 4-speed automatic transmission with available all wheel drive. The xB was only available with the 1NZ-FE that produced and in US spec, but offered both a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. All-wheel drive was not offered on the xB.
The Toyota bB was equipped with a compact spare tire under the floor of the luggage area. On the Scion xB, a compact spare tire was stored under the left side of a raised rear cargo floor. Since the spare tire raised the cargo floor by several inches, a storage bin was added to the right of the spare tire to reclaim some of the lost storage space. A jack was stored under the driver&#x27;s seat of the xB.

The Toyota bB had a pull-out storage tray under the passenger seat that the xB lacks.

The bB went on sale in February 2000, whereas the xB went on sale in June 2003 for the 2004 model year. Sales of the first-generation bB ended in December 2005, whereas the first-generation xB ended sales in June 2007.

===Scion t2B (2005)===

Scion t2B (Tall-Two Box) is a concept hatchback designed by Calty Design Research and built by Five Axis Models in Huntington Beach, California, with interior design by Calty senior designer Bill Chergosky and Naoki Hamajima. The 5-door hatchback included a 2.4-liter I4 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, 14-inch brakes with slotted rotors, 20-inch billet aluminium wheels, LED fog lamp, remotely operated power rear hatch, asymmetrical tri-level instrument panel features a large information ticker, MP3 docking station, dual moonroof, half-length suicide doors.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2005 New York Auto Show.

===Release Series vehicles===
The xB, like the xA and tC, was also available in a &quot;Release Series&quot; for each of its model years. These came with limited-edition paint colors, matching seat colors, and special modifications such as DVD players, custom tail lights, special wheels or wheel covers, and other accessories, to make the RS different from the others. All Scion RS&#x27; receive special badges indicating the serial number. Limited Edition vehicles were, from a marketing standpoint, used to create a buzz for the brand name, with their exterior colors tending toward loud or bright hues (i.e. orange, yellow, red, blue, green). Scion&#x27;s &quot;Pure Price&quot; program requires dealerships to sell the vehicle at the advertised price. Resale values of Release Series vehicles command a premium because of their packaged options and scarcity.

2004 model year

* xB RS 1.0 – only available in Hot Lava Orange with 2100 units produced (504 5-speed units, 1596 automatics)
The xB Release Series 1.0 comes with some unique features from the factory which include Hot Lava paint, color-keyed rear spoiler, matching orange powder-coated strut tie-bar, custom grill, color tuned interior and under-seat &amp; dash orange illumination.

2005 model year

* xB RS 2.0 – only available in Solar Yellow with 2500 units produced
This RS edition came with color keyed side mirror overlays with LED turn signals, rear spoiler, tunable stainless steel sport muffler, and a metal mesh grille. Inside there are stainless appliqués on the door sills, and yellow upholstery accents to match the exterior, and a plaque that shows the build number xxxx/2500. The RS 2.0 added $1,375 to the MSRP.

2006 model year

* xB RS 3.0 – only available in Envy Green with 2200 units produced
RS 3.0 changes include Envy Green paint, seven-spoke wheel coverings, and rear spoiler. Standard features include Alpine DVD audio/video system instead of the usual &quot;Pioneer&quot; radio; iPod connectivity; headrest entertainment system; a special steering wheel featuring a few buttons; which was later a standard feature between mid 2006 to earliest 2007. The vehicle also had a special grill, only on the RS 3.0, with the color matching the car, Envy Green; and a radar intrusion sensor. The 2,200 vehicles also received numbered badging. The RS 3.0 added $2,310 to the MSRP price.

* xB RS 4.0 – only available in a Torched Penny called Maziora, a line of polarized paints made by Japan&#x27;s Nippon Paint Co. is a (polarized goldish-brown) with 2500 units produced. The Release Series 4.0 is painted in a three-part Maziora Torched Penny paint, which is a color-shifting finish that changes depending on the viewing angle and/or how light plays off the car&#x27;s surface. In this case, the colors morph into shades of brown, bronze, and gold. In addition to the special paint, the RS 4.0 received a rear spoiler, Modellista grille, and rear bumper protector and everything is color-keyed. Inside, the floor mats are embroidered reading &quot;Release Series&quot;. It also got multicolor dash lighting, a new shift knob and a numbered plaque xxxx/2500.

===Safety===
The first generation received a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in the frontal offset test, all measured categories in this test were also rated &quot;Good&quot;. The xB was given a &quot;Poor&quot; overall score in the side impact test. The xB model year 2003–2006 did not offer side airbags but includes them for model year 2008–2015.

==Second generation (E150; 2007)==

The second-generation Scion xB is styled as a 5-door hatchback of the t2B concept. Toyota unveiled the production xB at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show. The new xB was rounder in shape and larger than its predecessor. The 2008 model year xB is wider, longer - including longer wheel to wheel - and heavier than the first-generation xB.

The first-generation Scion xB (being a rebadge of the original Toyota bB) was based on the Yaris platform, but the second-generation xB was based on the new Corolla&#x27;s platform. Design changes were said to be based on American buyers&#x27; &quot;wants&quot; relative to the first-generation.


The Scion xB was produced by Kanto Auto Works, Ltd. based in Japan. Due to the 2011 Japanese earthquake, production was suspended from 14 March 2011 to 18 April 2011, affecting several Toyota vehicles, including the Scion xB and Scion xD. Plants affected by the disaster included the Toyota Motor Hokkaido Plant, the Toyota Motor Tohoku Plant, and the Central Motor Corporation Miyagi Plant, which produces the Toyota Yaris.

The second-generation xB is equipped with a 2.4 L straight-4 Toyota 2AZ-FE engine rated at and , shared with the first-generation tC and the Toyota Camry, which at city / hwy has a higher fuel consumption than the previous model&#x27;s 1.5 L engine ( city / hwy). A five-speed manual and a sequential-shift four-speed automatic are the only factory options aside from the color and stereo.

A choice of three new head units is available on all 2008 Scions. All sound systems feature six speakers and standard iPod connectivity. The base head unit has MP3, WMA, and AAC CD compatibility and Scion&#x27;s SSP equalizer presets. The base unit can also be set to any of three Scion model presets (xB, xD, or tC) and includes an &quot;Automatic Sound Levelizer&quot; feature that automatically increases the volume as the vehicle speed and ambient noise increases. The Premium head unit features a small LCD that can display pictures and movies downloaded from Pioneer&#x27;s website in addition to the features on the base unit. A navigation system is also available. The SNS 100 system can play DVD movies in addition to GPS functionality and the features of the base system, aside from the backlit color choices.

All xBs come standard with four-wheel anti-lock brakes, brake assist, electronic brakeforce distribution, Vehicle Stability Control driver and front passenger dual stage airbags, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, front and rear side curtain airbags, and a first-aid kit.

In 2013, the xB was chosen by cars.com as a Top 10 Best Base Model.

===Model year changes===
Scion announced in March 2010 that the 2011 model, on sale late March 2010, is being given a facelift. Two new colors are available, and there are minor changes to the exterior body, including a revised front and rear bumper, new front grille, and new headlights and tail lights. The interior changes include a revised gauge cluster, center console and new driver and front passenger seats with new materials. The MSRP rises to for the manual and for the automatic transmission. In addition, the Scion xB went on sale in Canada for the first time along with the entire Scion lineup. In 2011, for the 2012 model year, a new radio with bluetooth became standard.

For the 2013 model year, Scion made a few enhancements including remodeled front and rear bumpers and a few interior upgrades including the optional BeSpoke radio. New colors are Absolutely Red and Nautical Blue Metallic (Absolutely Red was available in 2009 as RS 6.0). Stingray Metallic and Elusive Blue Metallic colors were dropped (Stingray Metallic was a very expensive color and Toyota no longer offers it on any model). Sales of the 2013 model began in February 2013.

Sales for the 2014 model began in December 2013. No major changes for this model year. All models now come with a standard Scion 6.1-inch display touch screen audio system. Sales for the 2015 model began in December 2014. For the new model year, Scion added a standard backup camera to the xB as well as continuing the updates for 2014.

The Scion xB, along with the Toyota Matrix, was replaced by the second generation Toyota Auris-based Scion iM, which launched in April 2015 for the 2016 model year. Due to the discontinuation of the Scion marque, the Scion iM was re-branded as the Toyota Corolla iM for the 2017 model year. The equivalent Australian-market Toyota Rukus was discontinued in October 2015 and the Japanese-market Toyota Corolla Rumion was discontinued in December 2015.

===Safety===
The second-generation Scion xB has won the Top Safety Pick award by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) for six years in a row. It received an overall &quot;Good&quot; score in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal offset crash test, and another &quot;Good&quot; overall score in the side impact crash test, with all nine measured categories also rated &quot;Good&quot;. And a &quot;Good&quot; score in the roof strength test.

===Toyota Rukus (2010–2015)===
A differently styled version for the Australian market, with the 2.4l 2AZ-FE engine and a four-speed automatic gearbox, released June 2010.

==Electric vehicles==
AC Propulsion has produced an electric version of the first-generation xB called the eBox.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Robotics Institute have converted a Scion xB into a commuter electric vehicle as part of their ChargeCar research project.

==Scion marketing==
The Scion xB&#x27;s marketing is aimed at Generation Y, defined roughly as people born between 1980 and 1994. This group of car buyers is extremely important to manufacturers due to their large numbers (78 million) and their differing perceptions and demands of the vehicles they drive. Despite the Scion xB&#x27;s target market, the average age of an xB buyer is 46.

Although Toyota expected the xA to sell better than the xB, the reverse proved to be true, with the xB outselling its sibling 2 to 1.

==Sales==
The Scion xB was Scion&#x27;s most popular model in the United States until 2011, when it was surpassed by the tC. In the U.S., sales of the xB have been dropping after the introduction of the second generation, from a peak of over 60,000 to 17,017 in 2011.

==Chinese copy==
In 2009, Great Wall Motor of China released the Coolbear, which is a copy of the first-generation xB, but with a different front end.

<doc id="964465" wikidata="Q1059120" url="?curid=964465" title="Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den">
<text>&quot;Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den&quot; is a short narrative poem written in Literary Chinese, composed of around 92 to 94 characters (depending on the specific version) in which every word is pronounced &quot;shi&quot; () when read in modern Standard Chinese, with only the tones differing. 

The poem was written in the 1930s by the Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao as a linguistic demonstration. The poem is coherent and grammatical in Literary Chinese, but due to the number of Chinese homophones, it becomes difficult to understand in oral speech. In Mandarin, the poem is incomprehensible when read aloud, since only four syllables cover all the words of the poem. The poem is somewhat more comprehensible when read in other varieties such as Cantonese, in which it has 22 different syllables, or Hokkien, in which it has 15 different syllables.

The poem is an example of a one-syllable article, a form of constrained writing possible in tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese, where tonal contours expand the range of meaning for a single syllable.

== Excerpt ==
The following is the first six characters of the text in Hanyu Pinyin, Gwoyeu Romatzyh (Chao&#x27;s own romanization system), and Chinese traditional/simplified characters. Pinyin orthography recommends writing Chinese numbers in Arabic numerals, so the number &quot;shí&quot; () would be written as 10. However, to preserve the homophony in this case, the number 10 has also been spelled out in Pinyin.

* Pinyin: 
* Gwoyeu Romatzyh: 
* Traditional Chinese: 
* Simplified Chinese: 
* Translation: In a stone den was a poet with the family name Shi...

== Explanation ==
The Chinese languages are tonal—meaning that changes in pitch can change the meaning of words. When written using a romanized script, the poem is an example of Chinese antanaclasis. The poem shows the flexibility of the Chinese language in many ways, including wording, syntax, punctuation, and sentence structures, which gives rise to various explanations.

The poem can be interpreted as an objection to the romanization of Chinese, demonstrating the author&#x27;s critique of proposals to replace Chinese characters with Latin letters—a move that could potentially lead to the marginalization or elimination of traditional Chinese script. The 20th-century linguist Yuen Ren Chao utilized this poem to illustrate the complexities and unique attributes of the Chinese language, arguing that simplification and romanization would undermine its rich tonal and logographic system.

Yuen Ren Chao&#x27;s poem illustrates the difficulty of translating the nuanced tones and homophones of Classical Chinese into a romanized script. It contrasts Classical Chinese&#x27;s literary and formal tradition with the spoken vernacular languages of China, and in doing so implies that attempts to phoneticize the written Chinese language for easier usage may cause it to lose some of its representational capacity.

The written poem is easy to understand for those familiar with Chinese characters, each of which is associated with a distinct core meaning. It remains intelligible in its spoken form in varieties of Chinese other than Mandarin. However, in its romanized form or when spoken in Mandarin, it becomes confusing. 

=== Evolution ===

The loss of older sound combinations in Chinese over the centuries has greatly increased the number of Chinese homophones. Many words in the passage had distinct sounds in Middle Chinese, but over time, all of the varieties of Chinese have merged and split different sounds. For example, when the same passage is read in Cantonese there are seven distinct syllables—, , , , , , —in six distinct tone contours, producing 22 distinct character pronunciations. In Southern Min, there are six distinct syllables—, , , , , —in seven distinct tone contours, producing fifteen character pronunciations. Therefore, the passage is barely comprehensible when read aloud in modern Mandarin without context, but easier to understand when read in other Sinitic languages, such as Cantonese.

The same excerpt in other dialects:
* Cantonese (Jyutping): 
* Hokkien (Pe̍h-ōe-jī): 
* Teochew (Peng&#x27;im): 
* Meixian Hakka (Guangdong Romanization): 

=== Vernacular translation ===
As sound changes over the years merged characters that had different pronunciations, new ways of speaking those concepts emerged. Often, disyllabic words would replace monosyllabic ones. As such, if the same excerpt from Chao&#x27;s original poem is translated into modern Mandarin, it will not sound as confusing.

<text>The first USS &quot;Lansdale&quot; (DD-101) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and later designated, DM-6 in the years following. She was named in honor of Philip Van Horne Lansdale.

==History==
&quot;Lansdale&quot; was laid down on 20 April 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was launched on 21 July 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Ethel S. Lansdale, widow of Lieutenant Lansdale. The destroyer was commissioned on 26 October 1918 at Boston.

Assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force, &quot;Lansdale&quot; steamed to Norfolk from 4 November to 7 November and joined a European bound convoy as escort on 12 November. Sailing via the Azores, she reached Gibraltar on 26 November for patrol duty in the Mediterranean Sea. Operating out of Gibraltar until January 1919, she made three voyages to Tangier, Morocco, and one to Algiers, Algeria. Steaming to Venice from 4 January to 13 January, she joined the U.S. Naval Force operating the eastern Mediterranean. She performed dispatch duty in the Adriatic Sea, principally between Venice and the ports of Austria (on the Croatian coast). On 1 April 1919, she was in Spalato, now Split, with and . Departing Split, Croatia (then Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on 10 June, she steamed to Gibraltar and the Azores and reached New York on 22 June.

During the next year &quot;Lansdale&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast with Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. Arriving at Philadelphia on 11 July 1920, she was converted to a light minelayer and reclassified DM-6. She steamed to Newport, Rhode Island from 2 June to 3 June 1921; joined the Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet on 5 July at Gloucester, Massachusetts; and until late October practiced laying mines off the New England and Virginia coasts under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Laurance T. DuBose. After at Boston, she steamed to Guantanamo Bay from 4 January to 9 January 1922 for maneuvers, mining exercises, and war games in the West Indies with Mine Squadron 1. Departing Culebra Island on 19 April, she arrived at Philadelphia on 25 April and decommissioned on 25 June.

&quot;Lansdale&quot; recommissioned on 1 May 1930 at Philadelphia. She joined Mine Squadron 1 at Yorktown on 17 May; engaged in mining and tactical exercises along the eastern seaboard; then arrived at New London, Connecticut on 30 September to serve as target ship for submarines. She departed on 12 November; and, after visiting Boston, she arrived at Philadelphia on 22 December. Remaining there, &quot;Lansdale&quot; decommissioned on 24 March 1931. On 28 December 1936 she was reduced to a hulk for disposal in accordance with the London Treaty for limitation and reduction of naval armaments. Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 25 January 1937, and she was sold on 16 March 1939 to Union Shipbuilding Company, Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>The Airbus Helicopters H215 (formerly Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma) is a four-bladed, twin-engined, medium-sized, utility helicopter developed and initially produced by French aerospace company Aérospatiale. It has been subsequently manufactured by the successor companies Eurocopter and Airbus Helicopters. The Super Puma is a re-engined and more voluminous version of the original Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma.

Development of the Super Puma was carried out during the 1970s, based on the successful SA 330 Puma. While retaining a similar layout, the fuselage was redesigned to increase its damage tolerance and crashworthiness, while composite materials were also more extensively used. Furthermore, a pair of more powerful Turbomeca Makila turboshaft engines was also adopted, along with a more streamlined nose, amongst other changes. Two distinct fuselage lengths, a shortened and stretched form, were developed from the onset. On 5 September 1977, the &quot;SA 331&quot; preproduction prototype performed its maiden flight; the first true Super Puma made its first flight roughly one year later. By 1980, the Super Puma had succeeded the SA 330 Puma as Aérospatiale&#x27;s principal utility helicopter.

The Super Puma quickly proved itself to be a commercial success for both military and civil customers. The French Army were a keen early customer, using the type in its new rapid response task force, the Force d&#x27;Action Rapide, and routinely dispatching Super Pumas to support France&#x27;s overseas engagements in both Africa and the Middle East. Indonesia also became a prominent nation for the Super Puma, with the state-owned aircraft manufacturer PT Dirgantara Indonesia securing a license to produce it locally. In the civilian sector, it has been heavily used to support offshore oil rigs and aerial firefighting operations. Since 1990, Super Pumas in military service have been marketed under the AS532 Cougar designation. In civilian service, a next generation successor to the AS 332 was introduced in 2004, the further-enlarged Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma.

==Development==

===Origins===

During 1974, Aérospatiale commenced development of a new medium transport helicopter based on its successful SA 330 Puma. The project&#x27;s existence was publicly announced at the 1975 Paris Air Show. While the new design retained a similar general layout to the preceding AS 330, it was powered by a pair of Turbomeca Makila turboshaft engines, which had recently been developed and were more powerful than the preceding Turbomeca Turmo. The rotorcraft&#x27;s four-bladed main rotor was redesigned to make use of composite materials. The design team paid substantial attention to increasing the new model&#x27;s damage resistance; thus, a more robust fuselage structure was adopted along with a new crashworthy undercarriage, while the rotor blades are also able to withstand some battle damage, along with various other key mechanical systems across the rotorcraft.

External features that distinguish the new helicopter from the SA 330 include a ventral fin underneath the tail boom and a more streamlined nose. From the project&#x27;s onset, it had been planned for the new rotorcraft to be available in two fuselage lengths, consisting of a short fuselage version that had similar capacity to the SA 330, while providing superior performance under &quot;hot and high&quot; conditions, and a stretched version which allowed for greater quantities of internal cargo or passengers to be carried in circumstances where overall weight was deemed to be less critical.

On 5 September 1977, a preproduction prototype, the &quot;SA 331&quot;, modified from a SA 330 airframe by the addition of Makila engines and a new gearbox, performed its maiden flight. The first prototype of the full Super Puma made its first flight on 13 September 1978, and was quickly followed by a further five prototypes. Flight testing revealed that, in comparison with the SA 330 Puma, the AS 332 Super Puma possessed a higher cruise speed and more range, in part due to the Makila engine providing a greater power output along with a 17% reduction in fuel consumption per mile. The Super Puma also demonstrated its far superior flight stabilisation tendencies and was less reliant on automated corrective systems. The development of both military and civilian variants was carried out in parallel, including at the certification stage. During 1981, the first civil Super Puma was delivered.

===Production and improvements===
By 1980, the AS 332 Super Puma had replaced the preceding SA 330 Puma as Aérospatiale&#x27;s principal utility helicopter. It quickly proved to be highly popular amongst its customers; between July 1981 and April 1987, on average, three helicopters per month were being built for operators from both the military and civilian sectors. The success of the AS 332 Super Puma led to the pursuit of additional development programs that produced further advanced models. These included the arrival of features such as lengthened rotor blades, more powerful engines and gearboxes, increases in takeoff weight, and modernised avionics. Furthermore, overseas manufacturing was also established; Indonesian Aerospace (IPTN) has produced both the SA 330 and AS 332 under license from Aerospatiale; IPTN-build rotorcraft were produced for both domestic and some overseas customers.

A wide variety of specialised Super Puma variants followed the basic utility transport model into operation, including dedicated search-and-rescue (SAR) and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) versions. Since 1990, military-orientated Super Pumas have been marketed under the &quot;AS532 Cougar&quot; name. As a fallback option to the NHIndustries NH90 programme, a &quot;Mark III&quot; Super Puma was also considered for development at one stage. By 2005, various models of Super Puma had been operated by numerous customers across 38 nations for a wide variety of purposes. In total, 565 Super Pumas (including military-orientated Cougars) had been delivered or were on order at this point as well.

During February 2012, Eurocopter announced that it was offering a lower-cost basic Super Puma configuration that would be more competitive with rivals such as the Russian-built Mil Mi-17. Starlite Aviation became the launch customer for this new variant, designated AS 332 C1e. In November 2015, Airbus Helicopters announced that manufacturing activity of the AS 332 Super Puma, which was redesignated as the H215 at that point, would be transferred to a new purpose-built final-assembly facility in Brasov, Romania. This move is aimed to cut production time and cost by simplifying production to a single baseline configuration that would then be customised to meet the needs of both civilian and military customers.

==Design==

The Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma is a medium-sized utility helicopter, powered by a pair of Turbomeca Makila 1A1 turboshaft engines, which drive the rotorcraft&#x27;s four-bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor along with a pair of independent hydraulic systems and a pair of electrical alternators. Fuel is housed across six internal fuel tanks, while additional auxiliary and external tanks can be equipped for extended flight endurance. For safety, the fuel tanks use a crashworthy plumbing design and fire-detection and suppression systems are installed in the engine bay. The monocoque tail boom is fitted with tail rotor strike protection; the forward portion of the boom also accommodates a luggage compartment. The retractable tricycle landing gear has been designed to provide high energy-absorption qualities.

The main cabin of the Super Puma, which is accessed via a pair of sliding plug doors, features a reconfigurable floor arrangement that enables various passenger seating or cargo configurations to be adopted, which includes specialised configurations for medical operators. According to Airbus Helicopters, in addition to the two pilots, the short-fuselage AS332 can accommodate up to 15 passengers, while the stretched-fuselage AS332 increases this to 20 passengers in a comfortable configuration. Soundproof upholstery is installed, as is separately-adjustable heating and ventilation systems. In addition to the doors, 12 windows line the sides of main cabin area, these are to become emergency exits if required. The lower fuselage can also be fitted with flotation gear to give the rotorcraft additional buoyancy. A hatch is set into the cabin floor which facilitates access to the cargo sling pole, in addition to individual stowage space for airborne equipment.

The flight control system of the Super Puma uses four dual-body servo units for pitch control of the cyclic, collective, and tail rotor. A duplex digital autopilot is also incorporated. The cockpit is equipped with dual flight controls. Principle instrumentation consists of four multifunction liquid crystal displays along with two display and autopilot control panels; for redundancy, a single integrated standby instrument system and vehicle monitoring system are also fitted. According to Airbus Helicopters, the avionics installed upon later variants has ensured a high level of operational safety. Third-party firms have offered various upgrades for the Super Puma, including integrated flight management systems, global positioning systems receivers, a digital map display, flight data recorders, an collision warning system, night-vision goggles-compatibility, and multiple radios.

A marine variant of the Super Puma has also been manufactured for performing antisubmarine warfare and antisurface warfare missions. In such a configuration, the Super Puma is modified with additional corrosion protection, a folding tail rotor boom, a deck-landing guidance system, sonar equipment, and the nose-mounted Omera search radar. For the antisurface role, it can be armed with a pair of Exocet anti-ship missiles.

==Operational history==
In August 1983, the French government created a new rapid-response task force, the Force d&#x27;Action Rapide, to support France&#x27;s allies and to contribute to France&#x27;s overseas engagements in Africa and the Middle East; up to 30 Super Pumas were assigned to the taskforce. In June 1994, France staged a military intervention in the ongoing Rwandan genocide, dispatching a military task force to neighboring Zaire; Super Pumas provided the bulk of the task force&#x27;s rotary lift capability, transporting French troops and equipment during their advance into Rwanda.

During the 1980s, the French Army were interested in mounting an airborne battlefield surveillance radar upon the Super Puma. The first prototype &quot;Orchidée&quot; was assembled at Aérospatiale&#x27;s Marignane factory and began testing in late 1988; the French Army intended to procure 20 aircraft to equip two squadrons. Orchidée was described as having a pulse-Doppler radar mounted on the fuselage&#x27;s underside, being capable of 360° scanning to detect low-flying helicopters and ground vehicles at ranges up to 150 km; gathered data were to be relayed in real time to mobile ground stations by a single-channel data link for processing and analysis before being transmitted to battlefield commanders. The system was said to be capable of all-weather operation, and would counteract hostile electronic countermeasures. However, development was aborted in mid-1990 during post-Cold War defence-spending reductions.

Indonesia has been a key customer for the Super Puma; state-owned aircraft manufacturer PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PT DI) secured a license to produce the type. While the company was initially involved in the assembly and finishing of Super Pumas delivered from Europe, PT DI has expanded the range of its manufacturing involvement in the type over time, while also expanding its collaboration with Eurocopter. In 1989, the Indonesian Air Force placed an order for 16 Super Pumas as a replacement for the aging Sikorsky S-58T fleet, but amid continued funding shortfalls, only seven units had been delivered by 2008, the operations of which were reportedly hampered by a lack of spare parts. The Indonesian government had also ordered 16 Super Pumas for purposes such as VIP transport, seven of which had been delivered by 2008. Production of these rotorcraft has been performed locally by PT DI.
A key export customer was Switzerland, having originally purchased 15 AS 332M1 Super Pumas, locally designated &quot;TH89&quot;, for the Swiss Air Force. These were subsequently joined by 11 AS 532UL Cougars, designated &quot;TH98&quot;, while the &quot;TH06&quot; programme was launched in 2006 to the retrofit the earlier Super Puma fleet with new avionics that either equaled or exceeded the capabilities of the newer Cougar fleet by RUAG. The Swiss Air Force has typically deployed the type for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance and search-and-rescue (SAR) missions. Swiss Super Pumas have occasionally been deployed outside the country, usually to provide humanitarian aid, such as a deployment to Greece where they engaged in aerial firefighting during August 2021.

During 1988, Sweden arranged to procure a fleet of 12 Super Pumas; they were primarily operated domestically, although some were deployed overseas occasionally, such as to provide medical evacuation services to coalition forces engaged in the War in Afghanistan. In October 2015, the Swedish Air Force retired its last Super Puma, replacing it with newer rotorcraft such as the NHIndustries NH90 and Sikorsky UH-60M Black Hawk. Six of these retired Super Pumas were sold on and refurbished for further service with other operators.

During 1990, Nigeria made a deal with Aerospatiale to exchange several of their Pumas for larger Super Pumas. In November 2009, an additional five used Super Pumas were acquired from France for peacekeeping and surveillance operations in the Niger Delta. In 2015, it was reported that a number of weaponised Super Pumas had been procured by the Nigerian Air Force for anti-insurgency operations against Boko Haram. During 2000, a pair of Nigerian Super Pumas were deployed to in Cross River State to improve area surveillance and increase available firepower in response to insecurity in the vicinity of the Bakassi axis.

In late 1990s, the Hellenic Air Force issued a request for acquiring more modern and capable SAR helicopters, in order to replace its ageing fleet of Agusta Bell AB-205 SAR helicopters, which were in use since 1975. The need for an all-weather, day and night, long range SAR helicopter for operations throughout the Athens FIR came up after the Imia/Kardak incident of 1996, and the growing tension between Greece and Turkey over territorial water disputes on the Aegean Sea. The Greek government signed a deal with Eurocopter for the purchase of an initial four AS-332 C1 Super Pumas in 1998. HAF acquired two more Super Pumas for air support operations of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games and six more helicopters followed up in the period 2007–2011 for the new CSAR role of the 384 SAR/CSAR Sq. All HAF Super Pumas are of the C1 version, which includes features such as a four-axis auto pilot, a NADIR type1000 navigation and mission management computer, FLIR turrets, an RBR1500B search radar, an engine anti-icing system, hydraulic and electrical hoists, a SPECTROLAB SX-16 searchlight, engine exhaust-gas deflectors, a Bertin loudspeaker, and six-stretcher interior configuration for MEDEVAC missions.
The Spanish Air Force operated Super Pumas for various purposes. The fleet participated in the War in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2011, at one point being the sole rotorcraft providing combat SAR and MEDEVAC cover in Afghanistan&#x27;s western regions, the last of these were withdrawn in November 2013. The type has also participated in firefighting operations domestically. During the 2010s, Spain decided to replace its Super Puma with the newer NH90, delivery of the Spanish Air Force&#x27;s first example took place in 2020.

&quot;VH-34&quot; is the Brazilian Air Force&#x27;s designation for the helicopter used to transport the President of Brazil. A pair of modified Super Pumas was used as the main presidential helicopters, having been configured to carry up to 15 passengers and three crew members. The &quot;VH-34&quot; model was progressively supplemented and later replaced by the &quot;VH-36&quot;, the later EC725. Various French presidents, such as François Mitterrand, have used military Super Pumas as an official transport during diplomatic missions. During 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was flown in a Super Puma during a tour of Iraq.

The Super Puma has reportedly proven to be well-suited to offshore operations for the North Sea oil industry, where the type has been used to ferry personnel and equipment to and from oil platforms. One of the biggest civilian operators of the Super Puma is Bristow Helicopters, which had a fleet of at least 30 Super Pumas in 2005; CHC Helicopters is another large civil operator, having possessed a fleet of 56 Super Pumas in 2014. During the 1990s, Iran procured at least seven Indonesian-built Super Pumas for civil offshore oil exploration missions. Super Pumas are also operated by Petrobras, the largest energy company in Brazil, to support its long-distance oil rigs. The largest civilian helicopter operator in China, CITIC Offshore Helicopter, operates a sizable Super Puma fleet. At least 19 Super Pumas have been operated by Germany&#x27;s Federal Police service as of 2018.

The Finnish Border Guard has operated numerous AS332 L1 Super Pumas equipped for maritime reconnaissance and SAR operations throughout the country. To better suit the challenging prevailing conditions, they are typically fitted with forward-looking infrared, a four-axis autopilot, and deicing apparatus. During the late 2010s, older members of Finland&#x27;s Super Puma fleet were transported to Romania to be modernised and equipped to the newer H215 standard.

In 2014, Airbus Helicopters, the manufacturer of the type, declared that the Super Puma/Cougar family had accumulated a total of 890 delivered rotorcraft to customers across 56 nations. By 2015, 187 Super Pumas had been reportedly ordered by military customers; amongst others, the orders included 29 for Argentina, 30 for Spain, 33 for Indonesia, 22 for Singapore and 12 for Greece.

In November 2017, Romania announced its intention to buy up to 16 rotorcraft and planned to make a 30% down payment towards the first four aircraft later that same year.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
* 16 July 1988 – an AS332 L operated by Helikopter Service AS ditched in the North Sea due to heavy vibrations caused by the loss of a metal strip from one of the main rotor blades. All passengers and crew survived.
* 14 March 1992 – G-TIGH lost control and crashed into the North Sea near East Shetland Basin; 11 of the 17 passengers and crew died.
* 19 January 1995 – G-TIGK, operating Bristow Helicopters Flight 56C, ditched in the North Sea, after being hit by an abnormally large lightning strike; there were no fatalities, but the aircraft was written off.
* 18 January 1996 – LN-OBP, an AS332 L1 operated by Helikopter Service AS, ditched in the North Sea some 200 km south-west of Egersund. All passengers and crew survived and the helicopter was still floating 3 days later.
* 18 March 1996 – LN-OMC, an AS332 operated by Airlift from Svalbard Airport crashed at Wijdefjorden. There were no fatalities
* 8 September 1997 – LN-OPG, an AS332 L1 operated by Helikopter Service AS, suffered a catastrophic main gearbox failure and crashed en route from Brønnøysund to the Norne oil field, killing all 12 aboard. Eurocopter accepted some but not all of the AAIB/N recommendations.
*11 August 2000 - Kaskasapakte, Sweden. A Swedish Air Force AS332M1 (10404 / H94) crash into the mountainside during initial approach to perform hoisting operations during a mountain rescue mission. All 3 crewmembers are killed. The cause of the accident was not fully determined, but difficult visual conditions is believed to have caused the crew to lose judgement of distance to the mountain side.
* 18 November 2003 - Rörö, Sweden. A Swedish Air Force AS332M1 (10409 / H99) crash into the sea during a night-time hoist exercise near Rörö in Gothenburg’s archipelago. The task was to conduct a number of hoist cycles to the rescue ship &quot;Märta Collin&quot;. On approach the aircraft suddenly hit the water at high velocity, killing six crew members. Only one crew member, a conscript rescue swimmer, survived with minor injuries. The cause of the accident was not fully determined, but was believed to have been the result of incorrect flight attitude awareness in bad weather. 
* 21 November 2006 – A Eurocopter AS332 L2 SAR helicopter ditched in the North Sea. The aircraft was equipped with two automatic inflatable life rafts, but both failed to inflate. The Dutch Safety Board afterwards issued a warning.
* 1 April 2009 – A Bond Offshore Helicopters AS332L2 with 16 people on board crashed into the North Sea off Crimond on the Aberdeenshire coast; there were no survivors. The AAIB&#x27;s initial report found that the crash was caused by a &quot;catastrophic failure&quot; in the aircraft&#x27;s main rotor gearbox epicyclic module.
* 11 November 2011 – XC-UHP AS332-L Super Puma of Mexico&#x27;s General Coordination of the Presidential Air Transport Unit crashed in the Amecameca region south of Mexico City. Mexico&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior Francisco Blake Mora died in this accident along with seven other crew and passengers.
* 21 March 2013 – During a readiness exercise, a German Federal Police (Bundespolizei) Eurocopter EC155 collided with a Super Puma on the ground while landing in whiteout conditions next to the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, Germany, destroying both aircraft, killing one of the pilots, and injuring numerous bystanders. The whiteout was caused by snow on the ground being stirred up by the helicopter downdraft.
* 23 August 2013 – A Super Puma L2 helicopter G-WNSB experienced a (so far unexplained) loss of air speed on a low approach and ditched into the North Sea 2 miles west of Sumburgh Airport around 18:20 BST. The aircraft experienced a hard impact and overturned shortly after hitting the water. However, its armed flotation system deployed and the aircraft stayed afloat. Four passengers were killed, while both crew and a further 12 passengers were rescued, most with injuries. To date, the AAIB stated it was not caused by mechanical failure. A court has ordered the CV/FDR be released to the UK CAA for analysis on behalf of the Crown Office.
* 28 September 2016 - Saint Gothard Pass region, Switzerland, A Swiss Air Force Super Puma struck a landline 50m after taking off, both pilots were killed and the loadmaster sustained undisclosed injuries but survived. The helicopter was a total loss as it burned out completely. After a lengthy investigation the pilots were found to not have been at fault.

<text>A dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy composed of about 1000 up to several billion stars, as compared to the Milky Way&#x27;s 200–400 billion stars. The Large Magellanic Cloud, which closely orbits the Milky Way and contains over 30 billion stars, is sometimes classified as a dwarf galaxy; others consider it a full-fledged galaxy. Dwarf galaxies&#x27; formation and activity are thought to be heavily influenced by interactions with larger galaxies. Astronomers identify numerous types of dwarf galaxies, based on their shape and composition.

== Formation ==

One theory states that most galaxies, including dwarf galaxies, form in association with dark matter, or from gas that contains metals. However, NASA&#x27;s Galaxy Evolution Explorer space probe identified new dwarf galaxies forming out of gases with low metallicity. These galaxies were located in the Leo Ring, a cloud of hydrogen and helium around two massive galaxies in the constellation Leo.

Because of their small size, dwarf galaxies have been observed being pulled toward and ripped by neighbouring spiral galaxies, resulting in stellar streams and eventually galaxy merger.

==Local dwarf galaxies==
There are many dwarf galaxies in the Local Group; these small galaxies frequently orbit larger galaxies, such as the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy. A 2007 paper has suggested that many dwarf galaxies were created by galactic tides during the early evolutions of the Milky Way and Andromeda. Tidal dwarf galaxies are produced when galaxies collide and their gravitational masses interact. Streams of galactic material are pulled away from the parent galaxies and the halos of dark matter that surround them. A 2018 study suggests that some local dwarf galaxies formed extremely early, during the Dark Ages within the first billion years after the Big Bang.

More than 20 known dwarf galaxies orbit the Milky Way, and recent observations have also led astronomers to believe the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way, Omega Centauri, is in fact the core of a dwarf galaxy with a black hole at its centre, which was at some time absorbed by the Milky Way.

==Common types==

* Elliptical galaxy: dwarf elliptical galaxy (dE)
* Dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph): Once a subtype of dwarf ellipticals, now regarded as a distinct type 
* Irregular galaxy: dwarf irregular galaxy (dIrr)
* Spiral galaxy: dwarf spiral galaxy (dS) 
* Magellanic type dwarfs
* Blue compact dwarf galaxies (see section below)
* Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (see section below)

==Blue compact dwarf galaxies==

In astronomy, a blue compact dwarf galaxy (BCD galaxy) is a small galaxy which contains large clusters of young, hot, massive stars. These stars, the brightest of which are blue, cause the galaxy itself to appear blue in colour. Most BCD galaxies are also classified as dwarf irregular galaxies or as dwarf lenticular galaxies. Because they are composed of star clusters, BCD galaxies lack a uniform shape. They consume gas intensely, which causes their stars to become very violent when forming.

BCD galaxies cool in the process of forming new stars. The galaxies&#x27; stars are all formed at different time periods, so the galaxies have time to cool and to build up matter to form new stars. As time passes, this star formation changes the shape of the galaxies.

Nearby examples include NGC 1705, NGC 2915, NGC 3353 and UGCA 281.

==Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies==


Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are a class of galaxies that contain from a few hundred to one hundred thousand stars, making them the faintest galaxies in the Universe. UFDs resemble globular clusters (GCs) in appearance but have very different properties. Unlike GCs, UFDs contain a significant amount of dark matter and are more extended. UFDs were first discovered with the advent of digital sky surveys in 2005, in particular with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

UFDs are the most dark matter-dominated systems known. Astronomers believe that UFDs encode valuable information about the early Universe, as all UFDs discovered so far are ancient systems that have likely formed very early on, only a few million years after the Big Bang and before the epoch of reionization. Recent theoretical work has hypothesised the existence of a population of young UFDs that form at a much later time than the ancient UFDs. These galaxies have not been observed in our Universe so far.

==Ultra-compact dwarfs==
Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCD) are a class of very compact galaxies with very high stellar densities,
discovered in the 2000s.
They are thought to be on the order of 200 light years across, containing about 100 million stars. It is theorised that these are the cores of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies that have been stripped of gas and outlying stars by tidal interactions, travelling through the hearts of rich clusters. UCDs have been found in the Virgo Cluster, Fornax Cluster, Abell 1689, and the Coma Cluster, amongst others.
In particular, an unprecedentedly large sample of ~ 100 UCDs has been found in the core region of the Virgo cluster by the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey team. The first ever relatively robust studies of the global properties of Virgo UCDs suggest that
UCDs have distinct dynamical
and structural properties from normal globular clusters. An extreme example of UCD is M60-UCD1, about 54 million light years away, which contains approximately 200 million solar masses within a 160 light year radius; the stars in its central region are packed 25 times more densely than stars in Earth&#x27;s region in the Milky Way.
M59-UCD3 is approximately the same size as M60-UCD1 with a half-light radius, rh, of approximately 20 parsecs but is 40% more luminous with an absolute visual magnitude of approximately −14.6. This makes M59-UCD3 the second densest known galaxy.
Based on stellar orbital velocities, two UCD in the Virgo Cluster are claimed to have supermassive black holes weighing 13% and 18% of the galaxies&#x27; masses.

<doc id="964480" wikidata="Q4811102" url="?curid=964480" title="Astoria Column">
<text>The Astoria Column is a tower in the northwest United States, overlooking the mouth of the Columbia River on Coxcomb Hill in Astoria, Oregon. Built in 1926, the concrete and steel structure is part of a city park called Astor Park.

The -tall column has a 164-step spiral staircase ascending to an exterior observation deck at the top.

==History==
The tower was built in 1926 with financing by the Great Northern Railway and Vincent Astor, the great-grandson of John Jacob Astor, in commemoration of the city&#x27;s role in the family&#x27;s business history. Patterned after the Trajan Column in Rome (and Place Vendôme Column in Paris), the Astoria Column was dedicated on July 22, 1926. Maintenance work was done in 1936. In 1974, the column was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The murals that make up the column were refurbished in 1995 and a granite plaza was added in 2004.

The column was one of a series of monuments erected by Great Northern between 1925 and 1926.

==Details==

The column stands atop Coxcomb Hill and includes an interior spiral staircase that leads to an observation deck at the top. The spiral sgraffito frieze on the exterior of the structure has a width of nearly and a length of . Projected by Electus D. Litchfield and painted by Attilio Pusterla, the mural shows 14 significant events in the early history of Oregon, as well as 18 scenes from the history of the region, including Captain Gray&#x27;s discovery of the Columbia River in 1792 and the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The frieze starts with the &quot;pristine forest&quot; and concludes with the arrival of the railway in Astoria.

Constructed of concrete, its foundation is deep. Built at a cost of , the tower has 164 steps to the top, where there is a replica of the State Seal of Oregon.

A plaque near the column commemorates the pioneering Community Antenna Television (CATV) system built by local resident Leroy E. &quot;Ed&quot; Parsons, initially at the Hotel Astoria, in which twin-lead transmission wires redistributed the signal of KRSC-TV (now KING-TV) in Seattle, Washington to area homes. Former Astoria resident Byron Roman was also involved in early cable invention and distribution.

The cast-iron spiral staircase inside the column was closed for safety reasons in November 2007. It was reopened to the public in time for the Regatta in August 2009.

<doc id="964483" wikidata="Q2704381" url="?curid=964483" title="Subcompact car">
<text>Subcompact car is a North American classification for cars smaller than a compact car. It is broadly equivalent to the B-segment (Europe), supermini (Great Britain) or A0-class (China) classifications.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) car size class definition, the subcompact category sits between the &quot;minicompact&quot; and &quot;compact&quot; categories. The EPA definition of a subcompact is a passenger car with a combined interior and cargo volume of . Current examples of subcompact cars are the Nissan Versa and Mitsubishi Mirage. The smaller cars in the A-segment/city car category (such as the Chevrolet Spark and Smart Fortwo) are sometimes called subcompacts in the U.S., because the EPA&#x27;s name for this smaller category — &quot;minicompact&quot; — is not commonly used by the general public.

The prevalence of small cars in the United States increased in the 1960s due to increased imports of cars from Europe and Japan. Widespread use of the term subcompact coincided with the early 1970s increase in subcompact cars built in the United States. Early 1970s subcompacts include the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Ford Pinto.

==History==
=== 1960s ===

The term subcompact originated during the 1960s. However, it came into popular use in the early 1970s, as car manufacturers in the United States began to introduce smaller cars into their line-up. Previously, cars in this size were variously categorized, including &quot;small cars&quot; or &quot;economy cars&quot;.

Several of these small cars were produced in the U.S. in limited volumes, including the 1930 American Austin (later called the American Bantam) and the 1939 Crosley. From the 1950s onwards, various imported small cars were sold in the U.S., including the Nash Metropolitan, Volkswagen Beetle, and various small British cars. The term subcompact did not yet exist, so the Metropolitan was labeled a &quot;compact or economy car&quot; and marketed as a second vehicle for use around town, not as a primary car. The Volkswagen Beetle was marketed with advertising pointing out the car&#x27;s unconventional features as strengths and to get buyers to &quot;think small.&quot; Prompted by the British government for exports, Ford was one of the first companies to try and sell inexpensive small cars in volume. From 1948 to 1970, approximately 250,000 economical English Fords were imported to the US while over 235,000 went to Canada. Models such as the 1960 Ford Anglia were promoted as &quot;The world&#x27;s most exciting light car.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
Due to the increasing popularity of small cars imported from Europe and Japan during the late 1960s, the American manufacturers began releasing competing locally-built models in the early 1970s. The AMC Gremlin was described at its April 1970 introduction as &quot;the first American-built import&quot; and the first U.S. built subcompact car. Also introduced in 1970 were the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. Plans for the subcompact AMC Gremlin pre-dated Vega and Pinto by several years because of AMC&#x27;s strategy to recognize emerging market opportunities ahead of the competition.

Sales of American-built &quot;low weight cars&quot; (including subcompacts) accounted for more than 30% of total car sales in 1972 and 1973, despite inventory shortages for several models. The Gremlin, Pinto and Vega were all rear-wheel drive and available with four-cylinder engines (the Pinto was also available with a V6 engine, and the Gremlin was also available with I6 and V8 engines).

The Pontiac Astre, the Canadian-originated re-badged Vega variant was released in the U.S. in September 1974. Due to falling sales of the larger pony cars (such as the Chevrolet Camaro and first-generation Ford Mustang) in the mid-1970s, the Vega-based Chevrolet Monza was introduced as an upscale subcompact and the Ford Mustang II temporarily downsized from the pony car class to become a subcompact car for its second generation. The Monza with its GM variants Pontiac Sunbird, Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Starfire, and the Mustang II continued until the end of the decade. The Chevrolet Chevette was GM&#x27;s new entry-level subcompact introduced as a 1976 model. It was an &#x27;Americanized&#x27; design from Opel, GM&#x27;s German subsidiary. Additionally, subcompacts that were imported and marketed through domestic manufacturers&#x27; dealer networks as captive imports included the Renault Le Car and the Ford Fiesta.

In 1977, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began to use a new vehicle classification system, based on interior volume instead of exterior size. Sedans with up to 100 cubic feet of passenger luggage volume were classified as subcompact. There was not a separate subcompact station wagon class with all up to 130 cubic feet of volume classified as &quot;small.&quot;

In 1978, Volkswagen began producing the &quot;Rabbit&quot; version of the Golf— a modern, front-wheel drive design— in Pennsylvania. In 1982, American Motors began manufacturing the U.S. Renault Alliance— a version of the Renault 9— in Wisconsin. Both models benefiting from European designs, development, and experience.

=== 1980s ===
To replace the aging Chevette in the second half of the 1980s, Chevrolet introduced marketed imported front-wheel drive subcompact cars: the Suzuki Cultus (a three-cylinder hatchback, badged as the Chevrolet Sprint) and the Isuzu Gemini (a four-cylinder hatchback/sedan badged as the Chevrolet Spectrum).

=== 1990s ===

During the 1990s GM offered the Geo brand featuring the Suzuki-built Metro subcompact.

=== 2000s to present ===

Because of consumer demand for fuel-efficient cars during the mid- to late-2000s, sales of subcompact cars made them the fastest growing market category in the U.S. In 2006, three major subcompact models were introduced to the market, the Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit, and Nissan Versa. These models were released by their manufacturers to aim at a group of younger buyers who otherwise shop for used cars. While fuel prices at the time were increasing, the small cars were planned before fuel prices soared; for example, Honda had announced that it would release a subcompact model as early as 2004.

By 2008, sales of subcompact cars had dramatically increased in the wake of a continuing increase of fuel prices. At the same time, sales of pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles had dropped sharply. By April 2008, sales of Toyota’s subcompact Yaris had increased 46 percent, and Honda’s Fit had a record month with an increase of 54 percent.

However, low fuel prices and the added room in SUVs impacted subcompact sales negatively in the late 2010s. During this period, industry executives and analysts said that the subcompact car market was returning to historical norms after an unusual period when manufacturers had expanded small car lineups in anticipation of rising demand fueled by rising fuel prices, which has since eased. In the United States, the segment experienced a 50 percent drop in sales in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. In Canada, the subcompact share of the car market shrank to 1.6 percent for the year ending 2020, down from 2.4 percent in 2019.

As a result, manufacturers stopped offering subcompact models and focused on larger cars instead, including subcompact crossover SUVs which offer higher profit margins and a higher average transaction price. Models that were no longer sold in the United States by the end of the decade include the Mazda 2 (discontinued after 2014), Scion xD (2016), Toyota Prius C (2017), Ford Fiesta (2019), Smart Fortwo (2019), Fiat 500 (2019), Toyota Yaris (2020), Honda Fit (2020), and Chevrolet Sonic (2020).

<text>George Washington Glasscock (April 11, 1810 – February 28, 1868) was an early settler, legislator, and businessman in Texas.

He was born in Hardin County, Kentucky, near the same area where Abraham Lincoln was born. In 1830, he went to St. Louis and from there to Springfield, Illinois, where in 1832 he was a partner of Abraham Lincoln in flatboating on the Sangamon River. He also fought in the Black Hawk War in Illinois where he was a Lieutenant and Abraham Lincoln was a private under his command. They were mustered into service by then Lt. Robert Anderson of later fame as Major Robert Anderson in command of Fort Sumter at start of Civil War. Lincoln became a surveyor for Sangamon County and Glasscock was a surveyor in Texas but it is not known if the two learned their surveyor skills together. George&#x27;s sister stayed in Illinois and married a friend of Lincoln&#x27;s law partner, Herndon. His sister&#x27;s husband is quoted as saying he had received a letter from George in 1865 and that he stated Lincoln had pardoned him.

In September 1834, he moved to Texas and settled first at Zavala, where he was in business with Thomas Byers Huling and Henry W. Millard. Glasscock was with James Chesshire&#x27;s company in the Grass Fight and Siege of Béxar. He was a surveyor and many land titles in Central Texas especially near the San Gabriel Rivers were surveyed by him. In a letter to his brother in 1838 he tells him he should come to the San Gabriel area as &quot;the land is cheap and the Indians has not killd me yet&quot;.

In 1840, he moved to Bastrop County, Texas and four years later to Travis County. In 1846, he moved yet again to the Williamson County area, where Glasscock helped to organize the county and donated 172 acres (3.9 km2) for the county seat, Georgetown, Texas, which was subsequently named for him.

In 1853, he returned to Travis County. He represented Travis and Williamson counties in the Tenth and Eleventh Texas Legislatures and was one of the managers of the State Lunatic Asylum during the gubernatorial administrations of Sam Houston, Edward Clark, Francis R. Lubbock and Pendleton Murrah. During the American Civil War, he served with the 33rd Texas Cavalry of the Confederate States Army. As a result of his interest in wheat growing, Glasscock built the first flour mill in what was then western Texas. He was an early member of Austin&#x27;s First Baptist Church and was a Mason. He continued to live in Austin until his death on 28 February 1868. He died when he was thrown from a mule on his land near Webberville.

His son, George Washington Glasscock, Jr., was a State Senator in the Nineteenth, Twentieth and Twenty-first Texas Legislatures.

Glasscock County and Georgetown in Texas are both named in his honor.

<doc id="964488" wikidata="Q251612" url="?curid=964488" title="Gone Troppo">
<text>Gone Troppo is the tenth studio album by the English rock musician George Harrison, released on 5 November 1982 by Dark Horse Records. It includes &quot;Wake Up My Love&quot;, issued as a single, and &quot;Dream Away&quot;, which was the theme song for the 1981 HandMade Films production &quot;Time Bandits&quot;. Harrison produced the album with Ray Cooper and former Beatles engineer Phil McDonald.

With Harrison uninterested in the contemporary music scene and unwilling to promote the release, &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; failed to chart in the United Kingdom, and it was his only post-Beatles studio album not to chart inside the top 20 in the United States. For the next five years, he largely took an extended hiatus from his music career, with only the occasional soundtrack recording surfacing.

==Background==
By the early 1980s, Harrison had been finding the current musical climate alienating. His previous studio album &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; (1981) had sold fairly well, aided by the John Lennon tribute hit, &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;, but in the United States it was Harrison&#x27;s first album since the Beatles&#x27; break-up that failed to receive gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With one album left on his current recording contract, Harrison recorded &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; in 1982 but refused to promote it or make music videos for the two singles. The title is an Australian slang expression meaning &quot;gone mad or crazy due to tropical heat&quot; or just &quot;gone mad&quot;.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s artwork was credited to &quot;Legs&quot; Larry Smith, formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.

==Release==
&quot;Gone Troppo&quot; was issued on Dark Horse Records in November 1982. Warner Bros. Records, which distributed Harrison&#x27;s Dark Horse label, were at a loss as to how to market the album and matched the artist&#x27;s indifference by failing to promote the release. The album peaked at number 108 in the United States and failed to chart at all in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Wake Up My Love&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Goes&quot; were included on Harrison&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989&quot;, and the title track also appeared on the compact disc version of that album. No tracks from &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; were included on the 2009 career-spanning collection &quot;Let It Roll&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Goes&quot; was covered by Joe Brown and other musicians at the Concert for George in November 2002.

In 2004, &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; was remastered and reissued, both separately from and as part of the deluxe box set &quot;The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992&quot;. The reissue added a demo version of &quot;Mystical One&quot; as its sole bonus track.

==Critical reception==

Among contemporary reviews, &quot;Billboard&quot; said of &quot;Gone Troppo&quot;: &quot;Harrison&#x27;s sunny lyricism shines brightest when least encumbered by self-consciousness, and here that equation yields a breezy, deceptively eclectic charmer.&quot;
&quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewer wrote: &quot;Because of his forays into the mystical, Harrison&#x27;s penchant for whimsy often gets overlooked. But here the zany side gets no short shrift.&quot; The reviewer admired &quot;lovelies&quot; such as &quot;Wake Up My Love&quot; and &quot;Dream Away&quot;, and described &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; as a &quot;vinyl postcard&quot; offering &quot;flashes of brilliance&quot;.

Less impressed, Steve Pond of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that, of late, Harrison had &quot;made a much better movie financier than musician&quot;, and he found the album &quot;So offhand and breezy as to be utterly insubstantial&quot;, with &quot;Wake Up My Love&quot; the only song of note. Writing for &quot;Musician&quot;, Roy Trakin considered that, in the wake of Lennon&#x27;s assassination two years before, Harrison&#x27;s &quot;tortured honesty … dooms this record&#x27;s attempt to heal those psychic wounds with calm, offhanded music&quot;. Trakin admired some of the guitar playing on the album but concluded: &quot;It&#x27;s too bad the public won&#x27;t forget George Harrison was a Beatle. His musical output will undoubtedly suffer by comparison until we do.&quot;

Reviewing more recently for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann writes of &quot;Gone Troppo&quot;: &quot;Clearly, Harrison could no longer treat his musical career as a part-time stepchild to his interests in car racing and movie producing if he wanted to maintain it. As it turned out, he didn&#x27;t; this was his last album for five years.&quot; Writing in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Mac Randall opined: &quot;The dynamic, synth-driven &#x27;Wake Up My Love&#x27; opens &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; and the spooky &#x27;Circles&#x27; (yet another lost Beatles song) closes it, but there ain&#x27;t much in between.&quot;

John Harris of &quot;Mojo&quot; likens &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; to Harrison&#x27;s final album for EMI/Capitol, &quot;Extra Texture&quot; (1975), and dismisses it as &quot;Another contract-finisher, this time with Warner Brothers, recorded super-quick, and issued with barely any promotion.&quot; &quot;Music Box&quot; editor John Metzger also holds it in low regard, writing: &quot;&quot;Gone Troppo&quot; was undoubtedly the worst of George Harrison&#x27;s solo albums … A few tunes, such as That&#x27;s the Way It Goes and Unknown Delight, might have worked better if given different arrangements, but as a whole, &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; was a largely forgettable and sometimes embarrassing affair that appealed only to complete-ists and fanatics.&quot;

More impressed, Dave Thompson wrote in &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine of its standing as the release that preceded Harrison&#x27;s temporary retirement from music: &quot;to accuse the album itself of hastening that demise is grossly unfair.&quot; While conceding that it was a far from essential Harrison album, Thompson considered it to be &quot;no worse than much of [Paul] McCartney&#x27;s period output&quot; and opined that &quot;Dream Away&quot; and &quot;Circles&quot; &quot;stand alongside any number of Harrison&#x27;s minor classics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson/Goldmine&quot;&gt;Dave Thompson, &quot;The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide&quot;, &quot;Goldmine&quot;, 25 January 2002, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kit Aiken of &quot;Uncut&quot; describes &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; as &quot;a return to form of sorts&quot; after &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; and a collection of &quot;amiable, light-hearted music made by a bunch of mates with nothing to prove&quot;. In another favourable 2004 assessment, for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Parke Puterbaugh wrote: &quot;&quot;Gone Troppo&quot; might just be Harrison&#x27;s most underrated album … [It] captures Harrison at his most relaxed and playful on songs such as the title track.&quot;

<text>Ulaangom (; ; ) is the capital of Uvs Province in Mongolia. It is located on the slopes of the Kharkhiraa mountain, southwest from Uvs Lake shore and south from the Russian border.

== Description ==
The city has a population of 37,754 (2022 census), 26,319 (2000 census), 23,000 (2006 est.), 22,300 (end of 2008 est.) or 37.8% of the total population of Uvs aimag. It is divided into two suburban areas named Chandmani () and Uliasny Khev ().

A Consulate of Tuva Republic of Russia is located in Ulaangom, and a Representative Office of Uvs Province in Kyzyl, the capital of Tuva.

== History ==
Ulaangom is believed to have been founded in 1686. The foundation of the Ulaangom Monastery was erected in 1871 as Dechinravjaa Monastery. Historical evidence indicates that there were grain plantations in operation in late 17th century in the area of Ulaangom.

==Climate==
Ulaangom experiences an extremely continental cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with long, dry, frigid winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is very low, with an annual average of . Owing to its location in a deep valley near the center of the Siberian High, Ulaangom is subject to temperature inversions reaching up to colder than middle and upper mountain slopes. It is thus one of the coldest places in Mongolia despite lying at a lower altitude than most of the country. Temperatures can reach or lower in the winter and or more in the summer.

== Culture ==
The city has monuments from the communist era, such as a monument of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, who was born in Uvs aimag and led the country for more than 40 years, in front of the Provincial Government Building. There are many educational and cultural organizations and institutions in the city. There is a branch of a university, a vocational college and 5 secondary schools.

==Tourist attractions==

== Transportation ==
Ulaangom is connected to the Russian border by highway, and imports its electricity from the Russian Federation. The old airport is no longer in service. New Ulaangom Airport is called Deglii Tsagaan and it is situated north of the city. The new runway and terminal were completed in June 2011 and the first jetliner of Eznis Airways landed on June 26, 2011 from Ulaanbaatar. As of May 2017, Hunnu Air was the only airline that had regular scheduled flight from Ulaanbaatar.

<doc id="964508" wikidata="Q6225171" url="?curid=964508" title="John Carling">
<text>Sir John Carling, (January 23, 1828 – November 6, 1911) was a Canadian politician and prominent businessman who was associated with the Carling Brewery in London, Ontario. The Carling family and its descendants later resided in Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, Brockville, London, Toronto and Windsor in Canada, as well as Jersey
in the Channel Islands.

==Life and career==
John Carling was the son of farmer Thomas Carling, who emigrated from Etton in Yorkshire, England. Arriving to Upper Canada in 1818, the family moved to London in 1839, where Thomas founded the Carling Brewery in 1843 using a recipe from his native Yorkshire. In 1849, the brewery was turned over to John and his brother William.

His political career began at the municipal level of government, in London, Ontario; then in 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, representing London. Re-elected to the same constituency in 1862, he briefly served in John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Cabinet as Receiver General, before the government fell.

After Confederation in 1867, Carling represented London in both provincial and federal legislatures until such practice was made illegal in 1872. In the 1871 provincial election, he defeated former London mayor Francis Evans Cornish.

From 1878 to 1891, he served in the House of Commons as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), holding the position of 7th Postmaster General from 1882 to 1885, and Minister of Agriculture from 1885 to 1891. In this position, he established the Ontario Agricultural College and the Central Experimental Farm near Ottawa. In 1888, he simultaneously held the position of Postmaster General for a second time, briefly.

After losing the 1891 election to Charles S. Hyman, he was appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. However, the election was disputed and declared void, thus Carling resigned from the Senate in order to run in a by-election in 1892, which he won. He served in the House of Commons until just before the 1896 election, when he resigned and was re-appointed to the Senate.

Meanwhile, Carling remained active in London affairs, using his position in the federal government to influence politics and business. In 1875, Carling and his brother William built a new Carling Brewery, and an even larger one was built after the first burned down in 1879. The brewery was one of the largest in Canada, and it rivaled the production of fellow London brewery Labatt.

Carling also ensured that the Great Western Railway, the London and Port Stanley Railway, and the London, Huron and Bruce Railway passed through London. Due to his influence, the Grand Trunk Railway began to manufacture their cars in London.

In 1878, he established a water commission to provide a water supply to the city. Carling also established the Ontario Hospital for the Insane in London. In 1885, he provided the land on which Wolseley Barracks was established, now the Home Station of The Royal Canadian Regiment and the garrison of the regiment&#x27;s 4th Battalion. He also facilitated the establishment of Victoria Park.

Carling was knighted in 1893 and served in the Senate until his death in 1911. He was buried in London&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 1927, the Carling Brewery sponsored a trans-Atlantic flight from London (Canada) to London (UK). The plane was named the &quot;Sir John Carling,&quot; but both it and its pilots, Terence Tully and James Medcalf, disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean.

Today, there is an arena in London named for him. The town of Port Carling, Ontario, is named in his honour, as are the agricultural buildings in Ottawa. Carling Avenue in Ottawa is named for him as well, as are the neighbourhoods of Carlington and Carlingwood.

== Archives ==
There is a John Carling fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<text>Fort Astoria (also named Fort George) was the primary fur trading post of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s Pacific Fur Company (PFC). A maritime contingent of PFC staff was sent on board the &quot;Tonquin&quot;, while another party traveled overland from St. Louis. This land based group later became known as the Astor Expedition. Built at the entrance of the Columbia River in 1811, Fort Astoria was the first American-owned settlement on the Pacific coast of North America.

The inhabitants of the fort differed greatly in background and position, and were structured into a corporate hierarchy. The fur trading partners of the company were at the top, with clerks, craftsmen, hunters, and laborers in descending order. Nationalities included Americans, Scots, French Canadian voyageurs, Native Hawaiian Kanakas, and various indigenous North Americans, including Iroquois and others from Eastern Canada. They found life quite monotonous, with the fish and vegetable diet boring. Venereal diseases were problematic. Types of fur taken in trade at the fort included beaver, sea otter, squirrel, and red fox.

The onset of the War of 1812 caused the PFC to fold as it was too isolated to expect any military protection or support from the United States. The Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) bought out the assets of the PFC in 1813, including Fort Astoria. They renamed it Fort George and utilized it as the headquarters of its most western operations, primarily based along the Columbia. In 1821, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company incorporated Fort George into its collection of posts after absorbing the NWC. The opening of Fort Vancouver in 1825 was planned to allow for a better placed headquarters for the Columbia Department. While Fort George was abandoned in 1825, the arrival of American naval merchants on the Columbia necessitated the reopening of Fort George by the HBC.

Competition for control of Fort Astoria was a factor in the British and the Americans&#x27; resolving their disputed claims to the Oregon Country.

The Fort Astoria Site was added to the list of National Historic Landmarks on November 5, 1961. It is marked by a reconstructed block house.

==Background==
John Jacob Astor was a German American merchant who over several decades financed several successful mercantile missions to Qing China. He promoted the idea of a joint company with the Canadian North West Company to open trade posts in the Pacific Northwest. However, Astor was unable to convince the British subjects to join him in such a venture. This did not deter the ambitious financier, who went ahead with his plans by creating the American Fur Company (AFC) in 1808.

The Pacific Fur Company was established shortly afterwards as an AFC subsidiary to establish commercial stations on the Pacific Coast. Notably Astor was able to recruit several NWC partners and employees into the PFC, including Donald McKenzie, Alexander MacKay, and Duncan McDougall. To create these new fur trade locations, Astor planned to send detachments of laborers and officers both overland on a route similar to one taken by the Lewis and Clark Expedition and on merchant vessels that rounded Cape Horn for the Columbia.

The &quot;Tonquin&quot; was used to carry a detachment of employees to the Pacific under the command of Captain Jonathan Thorn. After several days were spent surveying the mouth of the Columbia River, 33 men disembarked on 12 April 1811. Among the PFC men were eleven Kanaka laborers from the Hawaiian Kingdom, including Naukane (also known as John Coxe). Notable among the early staff of Fort Astoria were two Scottish emigrants to Canada, Alexander MacKay, who had previously been with the North West Company, and Alexander Ross.

==Operations==
===Construction===
By the end of May 1811, company employees built Fort Astoria out of bark-covered logs that enclosed a stockade and guns mounted for defense. Ross recalled that in almost two months, &quot;scarcely yet an acre of ground cleared&quot; due to the many initial difficulties the PFC employees faced in establishing Fort Astoria:

The place thus selected for the emporium of the west, might challenge the whole continent to produce a spot of equal extent presenting more difficulties to the settler: studded with many gigantic trees of almost incredible size, many of them measuring fifty feet in girth, and so close together, and intermingled with huge rocks, as to make it work of no ordinary labour to level and clear the ground.

By the time an overland party joined them in February 1812, the PFC laborers had constructed a trading store, a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, a house, and a storage shed for pelts acquired from trapping or trading with the local Native Americans. The traders arranged cannons around the perimeter for defense. The post was to serve as an administrative center for various PFC satellite forts such as Fort Okanogan.

===Activities===
On June 15, 1811, two unusual native visitors arrived: the two-spirit Kaúxuma Núpika (known in English as Man-like Woman or &quot;Bowdash&quot;, which is derived from the Chinook Jargon &quot;burdash&quot;) and their wife, both of the &quot;Kootenai&quot; from the far interior. PFC management suspected the two of being spies for the NWC, but at the same time welcomed their detailed geographical knowledge. A NWC employee, David Thompson, arrived about a month later after navigating the entire length of the Columbia River. Thompson knew the Kootenai couple and told the Astorians about Kaúxuma Núpika and their unusual life. Both the Astorians and Thompson&#x27;s party ended up protecting the life of Kaúxuma Núpika, whose prophecies of smallpox among the local natives put his life at risk.

Thompson, who for months had been out of touch with the evolving politics between the fur companies, believed that the NWC held a one-third partnership with Astor&#x27;s Pacific Fur Company. He carried a letter to the effect. The Astorians knew that the deal had fallen through but dealt with Thompson as if the deal were still on. The journals of Thompson and the Astorians are silent on the matter, yet both parties took steps to mislead or thwart the other, while at the same time remaining on friendly terms. It is likely that in this remote region, neither party knew for certain whether the two companies were to be allies or competitors.

In June 1812, the number of men at Fort Astoria were reduced to 11 Hawaiians and 39 European descendants. Fear of attack by Chinookans was high and drills were directed by McDougall frequently. A delegation of Chinookans visited Fort Astoria on 2 July quickly left after witnessing these military demonstrations. This fear by the natives convinced the Astorians that &quot;they are not friendly disposed towards us...&quot; having &quot;a desire to harm us.&quot; According to Jones, this &quot;latent distrust&quot; of Chinookans by Astorians from this incident was probably unfounded, as they entered the post &quot;for an innocent purpose&quot; and were frightened by the drills.

===&quot;Tonquin&quot;===


Acting on the orders of Astor, Thorn and &quot;Tonquin&quot; departed for Russian America in June 1811. At Destruction Island a Quinault man with familial ties to Vancouver Island, Joseachal, was hired to serve as a translator. While at Clayoquot Sound off Vancouver Island, Thorn became frustrated with the prices set by the local Tla-o-qui-aht people there. He reportedly took an animal pelt and struck the elder appointed as the primary negotiator. This greatly offended the Tla-o-qui-aht, and while Joseachal advised Thorn of the danger, the captain refused to immediately depart.

Eventually a brisk trade commenced with the locals who had remained on board, with the pelts being sold primarily for American blades. Soon after receiving the weapons the Tla-o-qui-aht attacked and in the ensuing conflict &quot;Tonquin&quot; was destroyed. Josechal was the sole survivor and later returned to Fort Astoria to inform McDougall of the fate of the vessel. The loss of &quot;Tonquin&quot; caused a great deal of hardship for the personnel at Fort Astoria as it still held a large amount of the trade goods and foodstuffs intended for trade in the region.

===First winter (1811–1812)===
Many &quot;Tonquin&quot; passengers and crew members listed in Gabriel Franchère comprehensive travel log did not get to winter over after the initial fort was built, due to either being lost (deserting), drowning or perishing in the June 1811 &quot;Tonquin&quot; disaster (aside a single Indigenous interpreter survivor). New Kanaka passengers had also been added during the stopover on the Sandwich Islands and similarly, some did not winter over. One Kanaka was exchanged for an experienced voyageur that came with David Thompson during the summer before he returned. Two additions came during fall 1811 following an expedition to establish Fort Okanogan. Some members of that expedition did return by January 1812 along with the first arrivals of the Wilson Price Hunt overland expedition. The first &quot;Astorians&quot; to operate the fort during the first winter of 1811–1812 were:

* &quot;Tonquin&quot; remaining passengers and crew members: George Bell, Antoine Belleau, Jean Baptiste Belleau, Russel Farnham, Gabriel Franchère, Paul Jérémie, Joseph Lapierre, Jacques Lafantaisie, Michel Laframboise, Olivier Roy Lapensée, Gilles Leclerc, William W. Matthews, Duncan McDougall, Donald McGillis, Thomas McKay, Donald McLennan, Ovide de Montigny, John M. Mumford, William (Guillaume) Perrault, Francis Benjamin Pillet, Alexander Ross, Augustus (Augustin) Roussil, Benjamin Roussel, David Stuart, Robert Stuart, William Wallace, and Henry Weeks.
* Kanaka additions: Harry, William Karimou, James Keemo, George Naaco, Dick Paow, Peter Pahia, Paul Pooar, Bob Pookarakara, Jack Powrowrie, and Thomas Tuana.
* Fall 1811 additions: Michel Boulard (in lieu of departing Kanaka Naukane alias John Coxe in June 1811 upon David Thompson return).
* Other 1811 Métis, Indigenous, and Iroquois additions: Régis Bruguier, Joseachal Shonowane, and Ignace Shonowane.
* January 1812 additions: First &quot;Astorian overlanders&quot; Reed party from the Wilson Price Hunt expedition - William Cannon, André Dufresne, Prisque Felax, Joseph Landry, Guillaume Leroux (dit Cardinal), Étienne Lucier, Donald McKenzie, Robert McLelland, John Reed, Michel Samson, and André Vallée.

Although based in Fort Astoria, Ross, de Montigny, Roussel, and Lafantaisie all wintered over around new Fort Okanogan. Robert Stuart, Pillet, McGillis, and Bruguier wintered around the Willamette River.

===&quot;Beaver&quot;===
Astor sent &quot;Beaver&quot; to resupply the fort which arrived in 1812. Besides additional American and British subjects, a further 26 Hawaiian Kanakas were transported to bolster the company workforce. From there the &quot;Beaver&quot; took the stockpiled animal pelts at Astoria on board and sailed for New Archangel. An agreement with the Russian American Governor, Alexander Andreyevich Baranov, was made for the exchange of foodstuffs and trade goods in return for Russian furs. From there &quot;Beaver&quot; sailed to the Chinese port of Guangzhou to sell the furs for highly valuable Chinese manufactured goods. Due to then ongoing War of 1812, &quot;Beaver&quot; remained at Guangzhou until the resolution of the conflict and only reached New York City in 1816.

===War of 1812===
The War of 1812 between the British and Americans brought tension to Fort Astoria, though not as a result of hostilities between the fur companies. On 1 July 1813, the fort officers of Donald Mackenzie, Duncan McDougall, David Stuart, and John Clarke, desiring to abandon the fort agreed to sell the PFC trading stations to the British-owned NWC, &quot;unless the necessary support and supplies arrive with advice from John Jacob Astor of New York, or the Stockholders to continue the trade, the same shall be abandoned as impracticable, as well as unprofitable.&quot; NWC staff arrived at the coast after running low on food supplies in the Interior on 7 October, with the liquidation of the PFC assets being executed on 23 October.

, a British sloop-of-war, visited Fort Astoria on 12 December 1813, previously instructed to claim the station as a British possession. Its captain William Black found the trading station far from militarily imposing, reportedly exclaiming &quot;Is this the fort about which I have heard so much talking? Damn me, but I&#x27;d batter it down in two hours with a four pounder!&quot; Black renamed the post Fort George in honor of King George III.

==Relations with Lower Chinookan peoples==

Scholars have affirmed that the American company and its &quot;economic success depended on mutually beneficial economic exchanges with Indian groups... who controlled trade.&quot; Many of the settlements near the station were under the influence of headman Comcomly. Consistently small stockpiles of foodstuffs at Fort Astoria created the need for frequent transactions with Chinookans for sustenance. Seasonal fish runs provided the major nutritional sources for the Columbian River based Natives. Major fish populations active in the Columbia included the candlefish smelt, white sturgeon, sockeye salmon, coho salmon, and Chinook salmon. This dependence on fish made it a primary food source for the Astorians, which caused some discontent among employees desiring a more familiar diet.

Terrestrial animals like members of the family Cervidae such as Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer were not found in large numbers around Fort Astoria. This made them another important source of trade for the Chinookans when visiting the PFC station. Another frequent item sold was the wapato root, with the volume consumed by the Astorians large enough to necessitate the creation of a small cellar made specifically to house the produce. Other typical purchases from Chinookans included manufactured goods. In particular woven hats were frequently bought for protection against the seasonal rains These hats were tightly interwoven, making them essentially waterproof.

==British fur companies==


Fort George soon became the center of NWC operations along the Columbia River, becoming &quot;a Fort William in miniature.&quot; At the time the NWC had no competition for the land-based fur trade in the region. NWC laborers developed Fort George by expanding its agricultural fields, in addition to creating &quot;several large buildings erected, and the pallisades [sic] and bastions strengthened.&quot; Fort George became an important port-of-call for the maritime fur trade. By 1818, there about 50 NWC employees at Fort George, over half being Hawaiian Kanakas.

In 1821, the North West Company was merged into the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which took ownership of the fort. Fort George continued to function the primary entrepôt of the Columbia Department until 1825. During a tour of the newly acquired assets on the Pacific shore, Governor George Simpson spent the winter of 1824 at Fort George. He found the station inappropriate both as a fur post and a regional depot. Simpson ordered the establishment of a new post and depot further in the interior along the Columbia River. A suitable prairie was selected by the Governor as having much more for agricultural projects. Besides his intention for this new post to supply foodstuffs for company stations in the Pacific Northwest, Simpson determined to relocate the Columbia Department administrative apparatus there as well. This new station was christened Fort Vancouver, with the initial construction completed in the spring of 1825. HBC personnel withdrew from Fort George two months later. Neighboring native villagers began to seasonally reside there, &quot;rapidly reducing it to a state of ruin &amp; filth.&quot; A small number of lodges, likely maintained by the Clatsop, were established fairly close to Fort George.

To counter Americans merchant vessels, a reoccupation of Fort George by the HBC was ordered in 1829. The post was placed at the forefront of competition between the British and American fur traders. While the post was gradually rebuilt, the dilapidated condition and extensive repairs required forced the sole clerk to live in a tent during the winter. The residency of the HBC trader was made to be wide by long. Along with two minor buildings, there was a small warehouse. While ordering a lowering of exchange rates for skins in 1829, Chief Factor John McLoughlin focused on maintaining commercial ties with the Chinookan peoples through &quot;forcing our Competitors to reduce their prices.&quot; This continued value placed in the Chinookans by the British subjects went extended beyond a major source of fur pelts. For instance, the surrounding tribes of Fort George were frequently employed to man the post canoes.

The sinking of such HBC ships as the &quot;William and Ann&quot; at the mouth of the Columbia necessitated the use of the trading post to guide ships inland. Beginning in 1830 the location was continuously used in a small capacity by the company. The &quot;Isabella&quot;, a HBC trading ship, crashed near the station during that year. Neighboring Clatsops appeared on the scene, offering to recover property from the ship. Despite Chief Factor McLoughlin lamenting that &quot;we have no alternative but to run the risk or lose the property&quot;, the assistance tendered by them proved invaluable for the company.

In 1833, the post had a staff of four: an English clerk, a Scottish field manager from Stromness, and two Hawaiians. Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, several men served as Fort George&#x27;s managing officer with James Birnie serving the longest. The Methodist missionary Daniel Lee reported that Birnie maintained &quot;abundant crops of most excellent potatoes and garden vegetables&quot; at the post. The growing salmon harvesting operations of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were focused on the fisheries surrounding Fort George. The company used the salmon to feed its employees, as well as exporting some to the markets of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

==Role in Oregon Question==

The USS &quot;Ontario&quot; was dispatched in 1817 to reassert the American claim to Fort Astoria, though ordered to avoid an armed confrontation. NWC partner Simon McGillivray dramatically claimed that the vessel was sent &quot;to seize or destroy the establishments and trade of the North West Company...&quot; The NWC partners had already instructed its staff at Fort George to not resist an attempt by Americans to reclaim the fur trading station. Despite the ceremony of formally transferring national possession, actual ownership by the NWC went on as before, and no actual American presence was established aside from the symbolic repossession.

The negotiations that would formally end the War of 1812 briefly touched upon the topic of Fort Astoria/George. The American government exerted pressure for the return of the station from British subjects. British Foreign Secretary Viscount Castlereagh determined a conciliatory policy. In a letter to Charles Bagot on 4 February 1818, Castlereagh stated that &quot;whilst the Government is not disposed to contest with the American govt&#x27;t the point of possession as it stood in the Columbia River at the moment of the rupture, they are not prepared to admit the validity of the title of the Govt of the United States to this Settlement.&quot; Ultimately the Treaty of 1818 established a &quot;joint occupancy&quot; of the Pacific Northwest between the United Kingdom and the United States. This accord allowed for subjects from either nation to travel to the distant region without hindrance.

In 1846, the post finally became United States territory as one of the terms of the Oregon Treaty, which ended the Oregon boundary dispute. In the treaty, Great Britain ceded its territorial rights south of the 49th parallel. As the treaty would have subjected the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to American jurisdiction, the company opted to sell off its possessions south of the 49th parallel, despite the fact that the treaty had specifically guaranteed their right to retain such properties.

<text>USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DD-102) was a built for the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1918, &quot;Mahan&quot; was a flush deck destroyer, and the first ship to be named for Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan. Her main battery consisted of four 4-inch/50 caliber guns.

== Background ==
Norman Friedman, a naval historian, observed in &quot;U.S. Destroyers&quot; that the First World War ushered in a new aspect for American destroyer design; e.g. a significant need for a large number of ships. Specifically designed for speeds to match those of the fleet&#x27;s new era of battlecruiser. The mass-produced destroyers that followed would have the same design speed of as the battlecruisers. Increased speed from to 35 knots required more than 90 tons of additional machinery, and modification of the hulls for greater efficiency. The ships would also be designed as a modified version of the 1916 &quot;Caldwell class destroyer&quot;.

==Design==
===General characteristics===
USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DD-102) was a Wickes-class destroyer built for the United States Navy by the Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was named for Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan and laid down on 4 May 1918. She was launched on 4 August 1918, and sponsored by Miss Ellen K. Mahan, niece of Rear Admiral Mahan. The ship was commissioned on 24 October 1918 – less than one month prior to the end of the First World War. &quot;Mahan&quot; was decommissioned on 1 May 1920. 
&quot;Mahan&quot; was built with a flush deck; meaning she was designed without a raised forecastle. &quot;Mahan&quot; displaced 1,060 tons at the standard load. The ship&#x27;s overall length was , the beam was and her draft was . The ship&#x27;s complement was 133 officers and enlisted men.

===Machinery and armament===

==Service history==
After her shakedown cruise, &quot;Mahan&quot; operated off Cuba until May 1919. She then steamed to the Azores to become one of the guide ships for the transatlantic flights of the Navy flying boats: NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4. &quot;Mahan&quot; returned to Boston, Massachusetts, via Brest, France, on 21 June. She was converted into a light minelayer on 17 July 1920 and designated as DM-7.

With the exception of a cruise to Pearl Harbor for maneuvers in early 1925, &quot;Mahan&quot; operated along the United States East Coast, in the Caribbean Sea, and off the Panama Canal Zone for the next 10 years. During this time, the destroyer participated in fleet training exercises, and patrolled courses for the International Six Meter Sailing Races of 1922 and 1927. &quot;Mahan&quot; assisted in salvage operations for submarines in September 1925 off Block Island, and did so for , periodically, from 17 December 1927 through mid-March 1928 off Provincetown, Massachusetts. &quot;Mahan&quot; conducted reserve-training cruises in the Caribbean Sea from 1928 to September 1929. Throughout the decade, in addition to her regular duties, &quot;Mahan&quot; served as an experimental ship testing new equipment for the Navy&#x27;s future use.

==Fiction==
USS &quot;Mahan&quot; was used in the &quot;Destroyermen&quot; series, written by Taylor Anderson. In the books, &quot;Mahan&quot; and her sister ship are pursued by superior Japanese naval forces after the Battle of the Java Sea and seek refuge in a squall. The squall transports &quot;Mahan&quot; and &quot;Walker&quot; to an alternate earth, one where a different evolutionary path occurred. Anderson also uses other decommissioned and never-completed ships in the series: the U.S. Navy submarine and the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser &quot;Amagi&quot;.

<doc id="964518" wikidata="Q2611788" url="?curid=964518" title="Katz's Delicatessen">
<text>Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen, also known as Katz&#x27;s of New York City, is a kosher-style delicatessen at 205 East Houston Street, on the southwest corner of Houston and Ludlow Streets on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen is not a kosher restaurant, although its menu is inspired by culturally Jewish foods.

Since its founding in 1888, it has been popular among locals and tourists alike for its pastrami on rye, which is considered among New York&#x27;s best.

Each week, Katz&#x27;s serves of pastrami, of corned beef, of salami and 4,000 hot dogs. In 2016, Zagat gave Katz&#x27;s a food rating of 4.5 out of 5, and ranked it as the number one deli in New York City. 

==History==
According to Katz&#x27;s chronology, brothers Morris and Hyman Iceland established what is now known as Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen on Ludlow Street in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. Upon the arrival of Willy Katz in 1903, the establishment&#x27;s name was changed from Iceland Brothers to Iceland &amp; Katz. Willy&#x27;s cousin Benny joined him in 1910, buying out the Iceland brothers to form Katz&#x27;s delicatessen. Their landlord Harry Tarowsky bought into the partnership in April 1917. However, according to food writer Robert F. Moss, records at Ellis Island indicate that Morris and Hyman Iceland immigrated to the United States in 1902. Moss states that the &quot;Iceland Hyman delicatessen&quot; had only opened by 1911.

The construction of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Houston Street Line in the 1930s required the deli to move to the present side of the street, although the entrance remained on Ludlow Street. The vacant lot on Houston Street was home to barrels of meat and pickles until the storefront facade was added in the period 1946–1949.

In the early part of the twentieth century, the Lower East Side was home to millions of newly immigrated families. This, along with the lack of public and private transportation, forged a solid community such that Katz&#x27;s became a focal point for congregating. On Fridays, the neighborhood turned out for franks and beans, a long time Katz tradition.

During the peak of the Yiddish theater, the restaurant was frequented by actors, singers and comedians from the many theaters on Second Avenue as well as the National Theater on Houston Street. During World War II, the sons of the owners – Lenny Katz and Izzy Tarowsky – were both serving their country in the armed forces, and the family tradition of sending food to their sons became established as the company slogan &quot;Send A Salami To Your Boy In The Army&quot;. The slogan was coined by Izzy&#x27;s mother Rose Tarowsky, whose son served in the South Pacific as a bomber pilot.

The next change in ownership took place with the death of Willy Katz, when his son Lenny took over. In 1980, both Benny Katz and Harry Tarowsky died, leaving the store to Benny&#x27;s son-in-law Artie Makstein and Harry&#x27;s son Izzy. In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of its establishment, with no offspring of their own to leave the business to, Lenny, Izzy and Arthur sold Katz&#x27;s to long-time restaurateur Martin Dell, his son Alan – who was a chef and a manager at a neighboring deli – and Martin&#x27;s son-in-law Fred Austin. Alan&#x27;s son Jake joined the business in late 2009 and is in charge of major operations.

In 2011, the U.S. government sued Katz&#x27;s for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The lawsuit came after federal officials had read a 2011 Zagat guide that ranked the 50 most popular restaurants in New York City and investigated whether they were ADA-accessible; the guide had ranked Katz&#x27;s 42nd. The restaurant celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2013 by opening a pop-up art gallery next door. The gallery featured original art by local New York City artists with Baron Von Fancy and Ricky Powell among the first displayed and others rotated on a monthly basis.

In 2017, Katz&#x27;s opened its first auxiliary location, in the City Point development&#x27;s DeKalb Market Hall in Downtown Brooklyn, and also instituted mail-order sales.

In September 2021, it was announced that Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen would partner with Hendrick&#x27;s Gin to make gin-inspired pickles. Master Distiller Lesley Gracie collaborated with Katz&#x27;s owner Jake Dell to create a brine that featured gin standard juniper and cubeb berries, with an additional emphasis on coriander, a botanical shared by both Katz&#x27;s pickles and Hendrick&#x27;s Gin. In December 2024, as part of a settlement with the U.S. government, Katz&#x27;s agreed to renovate its Ludlow Street building to make it wheelchair-accessible.

===Catchphrases===

During World War II, the sons of the owners – Lenny Katz and Izzy Tarowsky – were both serving their country in the armed forces, and the family tradition of sending food to their sons became established as the company slogan &quot;Send A Salami To Your Boy In The Army&quot;. The slogan was coined by Izzy&#x27;s mother Rose Tarowsky, whose son served in the South Pacific as a bomber pilot. It is part of the lyrics of a song in the 1950 Martin and Lewis film &quot;At War with the Army&quot;, and referenced in the Tom Lehrer song &quot;So Long, Mom (A Song for World War III)&quot; in the following lyric: &quot;Remember, Mommy, I&#x27;m off to get a Commie, so send me a salami, and try to smile somehow&quot;. Katz&#x27;s continues to support American troops today: the deli has arranged special international shipping for U.S. military addresses only and has been a source of gift packages to troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Another of the deli&#x27;s catchphrases is &quot;Katz&#x27;s, that&#x27;s all!&quot;, which came about when a signmaker asked Harry Tarowsky what to say on the deli&#x27;s sign, and Harry replied &quot;Katz&#x27;s, that&#x27;s all&quot;. This was misinterpreted by the signmaker, who painted the sign as it stands today on the side of the building.

==Tickets==
As each customer enters Katz&#x27;s, a door attendant hands them a printed, numbered ticket. As they receive their food from various stations/areas throughout the deli (separate for sandwiches, hot dogs, bottled drinks, fountain drinks, etc.), employees compute a running total of the pre-tax bill. If several people&#x27;s orders are combined on a single ticket, a cashier collects the blank tickets.

Katz&#x27;s has instituted a &quot;lost ticket fee&quot;. If a customer loses a ticket, an additional $50 surcharge is added to the bill. The fee&#x27;s purpose, as stated by the management, is to encourage patrons to go back and find the lost ticket in the hopes of preventing theft (substituting a smaller ticket for a larger one).

===Advertisements===
* In February 2025, Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal appeared in an advert for Hellmann&#x27;s mayonnaise, which was filmed inside the restaurant and first aired during Super Bowl LIX. The advert parodied the deli scene from &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;, with Crystal commenting &quot;I can&#x27;t believe they let us back in here!&quot;. The &quot;I&#x27;ll have what she&#x27;s having&quot; line was delivered by Sydney Sweeney.

<text>Premiere Networks, Inc. (formerly Premiere Radio Networks, shortened as PRN) is an American media company, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, for which it currently serves as its main original radio content distribution and production arm. It is the largest syndication company in the United States. Founded independently in 1987, it is headed by Julie Talbott, who serves as president.

Premiere Networks either syndicates and/or (co-)produces more than 90 individual programs and radio programming services/networks to more than 5,500 affiliates across the U.S., reaching about 245 million listeners monthly. Premiere offers talk, entertainment and sports programming featuring well-known personalities including Ryan Seacrest, Delilah, JoJo Wright, Mario Lopez, Bobby Bones, Crook &amp; Chase, Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, Glenn Beck, Steve Harvey, Big Boy, George Noory, John Boy and Billy, Sean Hannity, Elvis Duran, Dan Patrick, Bill Cunningham, Cody Alan, Johnjay and Rich, Jay Mohr, Leo Laporte and others. The company is based in Sherman Oaks, California, with 13 offices nationwide.

Many Premiere produced/distributed programs are also available on several on-demand audio streaming services, including iHeartMedia&#x27;s own iHeartRadio platform and iHeart.com website.

It also acts as a Primary Entry Point in the Emergency Alert System for its terrestrial radio affiliates.

== History ==
Premiere was founded in 1987 with an investment of (equivalent to $ in ). Founders included Steve Lehman, Tim Kelly, Louise Palanker and Ed Mann. The network produced three programs with approximately 250 affiliates. In 1992, Premiere entered the agreement with Mediabase, and later acquired the said company in 1994.

In 1997, Jacor Communications acquired both Premiere and EFM Media (producer of the talk program &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;), and in turn, Clear Channel Communications ultimately bought Jacor. Following the merger with AMFM Inc. in 2000, its syndication arm, AMFM Radio Networks, and its radio shows, were folded into Premiere&#x27;s operations.

Premiere entered a long-term agreement with Fox Sports to launch Fox Sports Radio, with Premiere handling distribution of the network to radio affiliates.

== Distribution ==
Premiere Networks&#x27; programs are currently distributed over satellite, NexGen Digital WANcasting, and downloadable via FTP. The FTP server serves both primary and backup delivery needs for weekly pre-recorded content. For years, Premiere used the popular Starguide Digital III satellite system to distribute their programs prior to their transition to X-Digital Systems (XDS) for satellite delivery.

Premiere&#x27;s entertainment programs are distributed on a mixture of fee and barter-based deals.

== Program schedule ==
All times are Eastern. Programs are organized alphabetically by franchise and display their date and time if they&#x27;re available for online download, and additional information.

<doc id="964545" wikidata="Q2003791" url="?curid=964545" title="USS Albuquerque (SSN-706)">
<text>USS &quot;Albuquerque&quot; (SSN-706) was a attack submarine of the United States Navy. She was the second U.S. warship to be named for Albuquerque, New Mexico. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 31 October 1973 and her keel was laid down on 27 December 1979. She was launched on 13 March 1982, sponsored by Nancy L. Domenici, and commissioned on 21 May 1983.

==1983–1989==

&quot;Albuquerque&quot; spent the remainder of 1983 engaged in operations at sea completing a variety of tests, examinations, certifications, and inspections. At the beginning of 1984, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; reentered Electric Boat Shipyard for post-shakedown availability, returning to sea on 15 April. In May, she transited to the Florida coast for weapons and combat systems certifications. During the summer, she participated in a fleet exercise and took part in a midshipman training cruise. In August, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; began normal operations from her home port. October and November brought extended operations at sea in the Atlantic Ocean, and, in December, she underwent additional repairs at Electric Boat.

&quot;Albuquerque&quot; began 1985 with sonar training and weapons systems drills in her local operating area. In February, she completed preparations for a two-month patrol that began on 27 February, returning home at the beginning of May. Operations along the East Coast occupied her time until mid-June when &quot;Albuquerque&quot; went back to sea. Two months later, she returned and took up local duty until November when she cruised to Florida to serve as a school ship for prospective commanding officers. &quot;Albuquerque&quot; resumed local operations out of her home port in December.

On 14 January 1986, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; entered Electric Boat Shipyard for a two-month restricted availability. In March, she began alternating between local evolutions and upkeep in her home port until late May. Between 19 May and 14 September, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; remained at sea, making port calls in Scotland and England. She returned home in mid-September and, after post-deployment standdown, reported to Exuma Sound late in October for sound trials. She returned to Groton briefly at the beginning of November but put to sea on 4 November to take part in two fleet exercises. Upkeep at New London, Connecticut, took up the period between 24 November and 7 December and an ASW exercise consumed most of December.

==1990–1999==

&quot;Albuquerque&quot; was operating off the coast of Long Island, New York, during the evening of 17 July 1996, however investigation determined that &quot;Albuquerque&quot; and several other military units were either out of range, unarmed or did not have the vertical launch capability of reaching TWA Flight 800.

In 1999, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; participated in a six-month Mediterranean cruise as a part of the battlegroup. The ship pulled into several liberty ports during this cruise, including Naples, La Maddalena, and Toulon. Despite working up as a Special Operations Force (SOF) delivery platform and having a minimal load-out of Tomahawk missiles, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; quickly became a Tomahawk launch platform during Operation Noble Anvil. The ship fired four strike missions, reloaded missiles in theater, and fired again. &quot;Albuquerque&quot; completed this Tomahawk mission with a 100% success rate.

==2000–2009==

&quot;Albuquerque&quot; started a refueling overhaul at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) 1 July 2001. &quot;Albuquerque&quot; was commended for being the fastest and most cost-effective Engineered Refueling Overhaul (ERO) in history during the shipyard period, 22.3 months in length. &quot;Albuquerque&quot; returned to Groton 8 May 2003.

The rest of 2003 was spent conducting local operations, an ORSE, and a weapons system upgrade. Most of 2004 was spent at sea preparing for the ship&#x27;s first overseas deployment since the shipyard. This included a two-month overseas surge deployment with a port call in Rota, Spain.

&quot;Albuquerque&quot; conducted a six-month deployment as part of the Carrier Strike Group from 13 October 2004 to 12 April 2005. The ship made port calls in Scotland, Portugal, Bahrain, Seychelles, and Crete. During this deployment, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; was awarded the Squadron 2 Battle Efficiency Award for 2004. &quot;Albuquerque&quot; was homeported in Groton, Connecticut, as part of Submarine Group 2.

===Alleged treason and espionage by crew member===
In July 2005, a fire-control technician named Ariel Weinmann deserted from &quot;Albuquerque&quot; and remained at large until he was arrested in 2006. In addition to desertion, he was charged with espionage, larceny, and destruction of government property. He allegedly passed secret documents to officials at the Russian consulate in Austria, and then tried to pass sensitive information about &quot;Albuquerque&quot; to agents of unspecified foreign governments in Austria and Mexico, before attempting to defect to Russia. In December 2006, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

On 6 August 2009, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; completed her change of homeport from Groton, Connecticut, to Naval Base Point Loma in order to maintain 60 percent of the submarine force in the Pacific in line with the 2006 QDR.

==2010–2017==
&quot;Albuquerque&quot; conducted a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific, returning to San Diego 15 December 2011. The deployment covered more than 40,000 nautical miles and included port visits in Brisbane, Australia; Yokosuka, Japan; and Guam. In conjunction with other ships from the U.S., Australian, and Canadian navies, &quot;Albuquerque&quot; took part in exercise Talisman Sabre 2011.

&quot;Albuquerque&quot; deployed from San Diego on 29 January 2013 and returned 21 August 2013 after steaming more than 30,000 nautical miles and visiting Yokosuka, Japan, Thailand, Sasebo, Japan and Saipan. The ship participated in several exercises with Japan and Thailand. This deployment included the ship&#x27;s 1,000th dive and 30th birthday.

&quot;Albuquerque&quot; sailed into Puget sound on 28 October 2015 after her inactivation in San Diego on 16 October 2015. She was decommissioned on 27 February 2017.

<doc id="964549" wikidata="Q3571913" url="?curid=964549" title="Yasmin Ratansi">
<text>Yasmin Ratansi (born January 4, 1951) is a former Canadian politician who represented the Toronto-area riding of Don Valley East in the House of Commons from 2004 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2021. She was elected as a Liberal in the 2004 federal election and served until her defeat in 2011. She was re-elected in 2015 and 2019. Ratansi left the Liberal Party on November 9, 2020, following a &quot;CBC News&quot; investigation that revealed she had violated parliamentary rules by using public funds to employ her sister in her constituency office. Ratansi sat as an independent for the remainder of her term and did not seek re-election in the 2021 election.

Ratansi is an Ismaili Muslim and was the first Muslim woman elected to Parliament.

==Before politics==
Born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Ratansi immigrated to Canada in 1974. She worked as a management consultant. She is a Certified General Accountant (CGA), a member of the Certified General Accountants of Ontario, and a fellow of the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada. In 2009, Ratansi was bestowed with the John Leslie Award by CGA Canada, given in recognition of CGAs &quot;who have achieved a high and favourable profile in the Canadian community.&quot;

==Politics==
In 1979 Ratansi joined the Liberal Party of Canada and campaigned for David Collenette. Later she was the federal Liberal candidate for Don Valley East in the 1988 federal election. In the nomination for the Liberal candidacy leading up to the vote, rival Mel Catre complained that voting irregularities allowed Ratansi supporters to vote freely while his supporters were barred from voting. A subsequent investigation failed to prove these allegations. Ratansi finished in second place 2,838 votes behind the Conservative winner Alan Redway. She served on the party&#x27;s federal campaign committee in 1992 and was treasurer of the party&#x27;s Ontario wing from 1993 to 1997. In 1998, she served as one of three co-chairs on the campaign to elect Mel Lastman as mayor of the newly amalgamated city of Toronto.

In 2004 she ran again facing former-member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) David Johnson. During her campaign, she spoke about the issue of immigrant underemployment. She also supported a publicly run health system. She won the riding by more than 10,000 votes.

During her tenure in Parliament, Ratansi sat through three parliamentary sessions. During this time she acted as the Official Opposition&#x27;s critic for National Revenue and as critic for the Canada Revenue Agency. She also chaired a number of committees including the Status of Women Committee, and the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. She has also served as Liberal caucus treasurer.

===Constituency office controversy and departure from the Liberal Party===

On November 9, 2020, a CBC News investigation revealed that from 2005 to 2011, and again from 2017 to 2020, Ratansi used public funds to employ her sister, Zeenat Khatri, as a constituency assistant in her constituency office. This was a direct violation of parliamentary rules, which were amended in 2012 to add siblings to the list of individuals forbidden from being hired (previously only parents, spouses, and children were listed).

Speaking with at least six former staffers, CBC News discovered both Ratansi and Khatri took various steps to conceal their relationship in the workplace. Staffers who were informed or became aware were pressured to uphold the ruse and &quot;be complicit in unethical behaviour&quot; while others were reportedly kept in the dark.

On November 9, 2020, 30 hours after being presented with the findings of the investigation, Ratansi announced on Facebook that she was leaving the Liberal Party and would continue to sit as an Independent while &quot;awaiting guidance&quot; from the Ethics Commissioner. Ratansi wrote that she &quot;made an error in judgment by employing [her] sister in [her] constituency office, and [has] remedied the situation, but this [did] not excuse the error [she] made.&quot;

Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned her actions as &quot;deeply [disappointing]&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; while committing to an investigation by parliamentary administration officials.

In March 2021, the Board of Internal Economy ordered Ratansi to pay back $9,391 for employing her sister. At the time, the Ethics Commissioner was still investigating her for allegedly employing her sister, verbally harassing staffers, and uttering racist remarks about certain minorities. She did not seek re-election in the 2021 federal election.

In April 2021, a former employee of her constituency office sued her for verbal abuse.

<text>Rear Admiral Silas Horton Stringham (November 7, 1798 – February 7, 1876) was an officer of the United States Navy who saw active service during the War of 1812, the Second Barbary War, and the Mexican–American War, and who commanded the Atlantic Blockading Squadron at the beginning of the American Civil War.

== Early life ==

Born in Middletown, New York, Stringham entered the Navy on November 15, 1809, aged only 11 years old, receiving promotion to the rank of midshipman on June 19, 1810 while serving under Captain John Rodgers in the frigate . He was present during the &quot;Little Belt&quot; affair in May 1811, and during the engagement with on June 23, 1812.

== Early career ==

Having received his commission as a lieutenant on December 9, 1814, he was assigned to the brig , Captain Thomas Gamble, which was part of Stephen Decatur&#x27;s squadron in the Barbary Wars, and helped to take an Algerine frigate. In early 1816, while &quot;Spark&quot; was at Gibraltar, a French brig, attempting to enter the bay in a heavy gale, capsized. Stringham and six seamen in a small boat, pulled over to the brig, and rescued five of the crew. He attempted to return to &quot;Spark&quot;, but could make no headway, so turned and pulled for the Algerian shore, but was wrecked in the heavy surf, with one of his crew and two of the Frenchmen drowned.

In 1819 Stringham was serving aboard the , conveying black settlers to Liberia. While &quot;Cyane&quot; was off the African coast. Captain Edward Trenchard gave Stringham command of a boat in the capturing of four slavers. Trenchard then appointed Stingham prize-master and sent him home with them. In 1821 Stringham was appointed first lieutenant of the brig in the West Indies Squadron, and from 1825 to 1829 served at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In late 1829 he was appointed First Lieutenant of the to take part in the search for his former ship &quot;Hornet&quot;, believed lost. During the search he was transferred to the sloop , and sent to Cartagena, finally returning to New York in 1830.

Stringham was promoted to commander on March 3, 1831, and for the next five years was engaged on shore duty. In 1836-37 he served in the Mediterranean Squadron commanding the , then returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Receiving promotion to captain in 1841, he commanded the razee in the Home Squadron in 1843, then returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, serving as commandant in 1845–46.

== Mexican-American War ==

In late 1846 he was placed in command of the ship of the line , and during the Mexican–American War took part in the bombardment of Vera Cruz as it was besieged by troops under General Winfield Scott. For a short time afterwards he commanded the Brazil Squadron, but in 1851 took charge of the Gosport Navy Yard. Between 1852 and 1855 he commanded the Mediterranean Squadron, his flagship being the frigate . He then returned to Gosport, where he remained till 1859.

== American Civil War ==

In March and April, 1861, Stringham was Chief, Organization Office, U.S. Navy. He took command of the USS &quot;Minnesota&quot; in April 1861. 
He was Flag officer of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron from June 8, 1861 to September 18, 1861. In August he was sent with troops under General Benjamin F. Butler, to capture two coastal forts near Cape Hatteras. In the ensuing battle, the fortifications were captured without loss, though not without some difficulty owing to the weather, and the fleet returned to Fort Monroe to general acclaim. 

Soon after the return of the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries, acclaim for Strigham&#x27;s performance gave way to criticism of Stringham for not taking his ships closer in, and continuing to attack along the coast. The fact that his ships drew too much water to enter the shallow coastal waters, and that he had been directly ordered to return immediately, eventually emerged, but apparently too late to soothe his irritation, as the next month, at his own request, he was relieved of his command. He was placed on the retired list on December 21, 1861.

Strigham served as Chairman of the Board to Examine the Robert I. Stevens Battery I, from November 1, 1861 to December 24, 1861. 

As some small compensation on August 1, 1862 he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on the retired list to rank from July 16, 1862. 

Strigham served as Chairman of the Navy Yard Site Selection Board from August 12, 1862 to October 24, 1862. 

On February 7, 1863, Stringham received the Thanks of Congress, presented &quot;to Rear Admiral Silas H. Stringham, now on the retired list, for distinguished services in the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark&quot;.

Though no longer on active duty, Stringham served as commandant of the Boston Navy Yard, 1864–66, and as port admiral of New York in 1870.

== Later life ==

Rear Admiral Stringham died in Brooklyn, New York. He was buried at Green Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

== Legacy ==

Two Navy ships have been named in his honor.

<doc id="964560" wikidata="Q1780056" url="?curid=964560" title="Norteño (music)">
<text>Norteño or Norteña (, &quot;northern&quot;), also música norteña, is a subgenre of regional Mexican music. The music is most often based on duple and triple metre and its lyrics often deal with socially relevant topics, although there are also many norteño love songs. The accordion and the bajo sexto are traditional norteño&#x27;s most characteristic instruments.

The genre is popular in both Mexico and the United States, especially among the Mexican and Mexican-American community, and it has become popular in other Spanish-speaking countries as far away as Chile. Though originating from rural areas, norteño is popular in both rural and urban areas.

A conjunto norteño is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. It mostly includes diatonic accordion, bajo sexto, electric bass or double bass, drums, and depending on the region, alto saxophone.

==Repertoire==
The norteño repertoire covers canción ranchera, corrido, ballad, bolero, chotís, cumbia, huapango norteño, mazurka, polka, redowa and waltz.

==History==
===Origins===
Emperor Maximilian I brought Central European music to México during his reign (beginning 1863) in the Second Mexican Empire. By 1864, he had accumulated marching bands and musicians to entertain him. In 1867, the Mexican Republic executed Maximilian, thereby ending the Austrian empire in Mexico. Many of Maximilian&#x27;s former soldiers and fellow countrymen fled north and dispersed into what is now the southwestern United States. Norteño music developed from a blending of Mexican and Spanish oral and musical traditions, military brass band instrumentation, and European musical styles such as polka and waltz.

European immigrants from Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States also brought dance traditions such as the varsovienne. The focus on the accordion in the music of their home countries was integrated into Mexican music, and became an essential instrument. It was called norteño (&quot;northern&quot;) because it was most popular in the northern regions of Mexico.

The late 1910s and 1920s were the golden age of the corrido, a form of ballad. Mexicans on both sides of the border came to San Antonio, Texas, to record in hotels. Their songs memorialize the Mexican political revolution of the time. Los Alegres de Terán and Los Donneños were among the first norteño bands. Later in the century, the genre became more commercial with the works of Los Relámpagos del Norte and other groups. More recent bands such as Intocable integrate elements of rock music and other popular styles.

==Modernization==
Modern norteño has also diverged significantly from more original &quot;oldie&quot; norteño of pre-1950s artists such as Narciso Martínez. Since the 1970s and 1980s, most norteño bands have replaced the tololoche with an electric bass guitar, and the snare drum with a full drum set. The traditional bajo sexto-accordion style of Los Alegres de Terán and Los Donneños transformed into the modern style typical to that of Los Tigres del Norte, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, Intocable, and Duelo. In 2014, Los Tigres del Norte released the album &quot;Realidades&quot;, which contains the song &quot;Era Diferente&quot; (&quot;She Was Different&quot;) about a lesbian teenager who falls in love with her best friend; according to lead singer and songwriter Jorge Hernández, this is the first time a norteño band has ever written a gay love song.

==Regional variations==
Northeastern Norteño: The most traditional style of norteño. Mainly popular in Mexico&#x27;s northeastern and central states, and parts of the United States with large Mexican populations from those regions. Some artists that fall under this style include Los Cadetes de Linares, Ramón Ayala y Los Bravos del Norte, Los Invasores de Nuevo León, Los Cardenales de Nuevo León, and Pesado.

Pacific Norteño: Uses the same instruments as traditional northeastern norteño, but has a rougher sound; in part due to being influenced by banda music from Sinaloa. Also, some bands use a piano accordion instead of the traditional button accordion. Mainly popular in the Mexican states that border the Pacific Ocean, as well as the central states, and in parts of the United States with large Mexican populations from those regions. Some artists from this style include Los Tigres del Norte, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, Los Buitres de Culiacán, Los Titanes de Durango, and Marca Registrada. 

Norteño-Sax: Incorporates an alto saxophone as a primary instrument along with an accordion. Sounds closer to traditional norteño, but with an emphasis on the saxophone. Several bands are influenced by grupero music and incorporate an electronic keyboard for their ballads and romantic cumbias. Mainly popular in Mexico&#x27;s landlocked states, and in parts of the United States with large Mexican populations from that region. Some artists under this umbrella include Conjunto Primavera, Los Rieleros del Norte, Polo Urías y su Máquina Norteña, La Fiera de Ojinaga, and La Maquinaria Norteña.

Norteño-Banda: Is essentially pacific norteño, but replaces the bass with a sousaphone; an instrument typically used in banda music for the low notes. Like bass-driven pacific norteño, it is mainly popular in Mexico&#x27;s pacific and central states, and in parts of the United States with large Mexican populations from those regions. Some artists include Calibre 50, Voz de Mando, Colmillo Norteño, Revolver Cannabis, and Código FN. 

Norteño Light: Is essentially northeastern norteño, but with a more pop-oriented sound, relaxed rhythms, and contemporary lyrics. It may also incorporate mildly rock elements. Mainly popular in Mexico&#x27;s northeastern and central states, and parts of the United States with large Mexican populations from those regions. Some artists include Intocable, Duelo, La Firma, Siggno, and Grupo Frontera.

<text>Stöfler is a large lunar impact crater located in the crater-dotted southern highlands. It was named after 15th-16th century German astronomer and mathematician Johannes Stöffler. It sits to the west of the crater Maurolycus. The distorted crater Fernelius is attached to the northern rim, and Miller and Nasireddin lie to the west. Faraday has overlain and damaged the western rim, and this crater in turn has been overlain by several smaller craters.

The rim of Stöfler is worn and eroded, but the outline remains relatively intact except where overlain by Faraday. The smaller Stöfler K intrudes into the northwestern rim, and Stöfler F forms an indentation into the base of the southwestern interior wall.

The crater floor has been filled in with deposits, either from lava flows or ejecta from basin impacts, and is relatively flat and featureless in the northwest half. If there was a central peak, it has now become buried. The floor has a low albedo, making the crater relatively easy to identify as it is one of the few craters in this region of the lunar surface that has a dark floor. Traces of bright ray material from Tycho, located to the west, can be seen across the floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Stöfler.

<text>Robert A. Ley ( ; born March 16, 1955) is an American sports anchor and reporter, best known for his work at ESPN. A multiple Emmy Award-winner, he was the longest-tenured on-air employee of the network, having joined ESPN just three days after the network&#x27;s 1979 launch and retiring from the network effective at the end of June 2019.

==Early life and education==
Ley was born in Newark, New Jersey. He grew up in Bloomfield, New Jersey, where he attended Bloomfield High School. He got his start in broadcasting as a sportscaster and program director at WSOU at Seton Hall University, and interned as a production staffer at WOR-AM in New York City. After graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications, Ley worked several minor broadcasting jobs, including public address announcer with the New York Cosmos soccer team, before landing his first major position with ESPN just three days after the network&#x27;s launch in 1979.

==Career==
In the mid to late 1970s, Bob was Sports Director at Suburban Cablevision TV3 out of East Orange, New Jersey, where he hosted an award-winning local-oriented sports show, Time In, alongside Bruce Beck, who would move on to WNBC, Channel 4 in New York. Ley joined ESPN on September 9, 1979. In 1980, he hosted the first televised NCAA Selection Show, though the airing would switch to CBS two years later. Starting in 1990, Ley hosted ESPN&#x27;s investigative program &quot;Outside the Lines&quot;. He hosted &quot;SportsCenter&quot; for much of his career at ESPN, and on August 9, 2004, he hosted an &quot;old school&quot; edition with longtime broadcasting partner Charley Steiner.

Ley was the primary studio host for ESPN&#x27;s telecasts of major international professional soccer tournaments, including the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the 2012 UEFA European Championship and the 2016 UEFA European Championship. During the Night of 1000 Stars, Grantland.com&#x27;s Men in Blazers, Michael Davies and Rog Bennett, presented Ley with the first Men In Blazers Golden Blazer for lifetime services to American soccer. During the presentation of the Golden Blazer, the Men in Blazers showed footage of Ley&#x27;s anchoring of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and presenting highlights of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team qualifying for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. It was the first time the USMNT qualified for the FIFA World Cup since 1950.

On September 7, 2014, in recognition of ESPN&#x27;s 35th anniversary as a cable network, he was honored as one of 19 &quot;ESPN Originals&quot;, employees who have been with the network from the beginning. Ley took an indefinite sabbatical from his ESPN hosting duties starting on October 1, 2018. On June 26, 2019, Ley announced his retirement from ESPN, effective at the end of the month.

==Personal life==
Ley is married to Barbara, and has two children. He serves on the board of regents for Seton Hall University.

==Honors==
* 1987 – Bloomfield High School Athletic Hall of Fame
* 1995 – Northeastern University Center for Study of Sport and Society and School of Journalism Excellence in Sports Journalism Award
* WSOU-FM Hall of Fame Member

<doc id="964578" wikidata="Q907446" url="?curid=964578" title="Rossmann fold">
<text>The Rossmann fold is a tertiary fold found in proteins that bind nucleotides, such as enzyme cofactors FAD, NAD+, and NADP+. This fold is composed of alternating beta strands and alpha helical segments where the beta strands are hydrogen bonded to each other forming an extended beta sheet and the alpha helices surround both faces of the sheet to produce a three-layered sandwich. The classical Rossmann fold contains six beta strands whereas Rossmann-like folds, sometimes referred to as Rossmannoid folds, contain only five strands. The initial beta-alpha-beta (bab) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann who first noticed this structural motif in the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in 1970 and who later observed that this was a frequently occurring motif in nucleotide binding proteins.

Rossmann and Rossmannoid fold proteins are extremely common. They make up 20% of proteins with known structures in the Protein Data Bank, and are found in more than 38% of KEGG metabolic pathways. The fold is extremely versatile in that it can accommodate a wide range of ligands. They can function as metabolic enzymes, DNA/RNA binding, and regulatory proteins in addition to the traditional role.

== History ==
The Rossmann fold was first described by Dr. Michael Rossmann and coworkers in 1974. He was the first to deduce the structure of lactate dehydrogenase and characterized the structural motif within this enzyme which would later be called the Rossmann fold. It was subsequently found that most dehydrogenases that utilize NAD or NADP contain this same structurally conserved Rossmann fold motif.

In 1989, Israel Hanukoglu from the Weizmann Institute of Science discovered that the consensus sequence for NADP+ binding site in some enzymes that utilize NADP+ differs from the NAD+ binding motif. This discovery was used to re-engineer coenzyme specificities of enzymes.

== Structure ==

The Rossmann fold is composed of six parallel beta strands that form an extended beta sheet. The first three strands are connected by α- helices resulting in a beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta structure. This pattern is duplicated once to produce an inverted tandem repeat containing six strands. Overall, the strands are arranged in the order of 321456 (1 = N-terminal, 6 = C-terminal). Five stranded Rossmann-like folds are arranged in the order 32145. The overall tertiary structure of the fold resembles a three-layered sandwich wherein the filling is composed of an extended beta sheet and the two slices of bread are formed by the connecting parallel alpha-helices.

One of the features of the Rossmann fold is its co-factor binding specificity. Through the analysis of four NADH-binding enzymes, it was found that in all four enzymes the nucleotide co-factor entailed the same conformation and orientation with respect to the polypeptide chain.

The fold may contain additional strands joined by short helices or coils. The most conserved segment of Rossmann folds is the first beta-alpha-beta segment. Phosphate-binding loop is located between the first beta-strand and alpha-helix. On the tip of the second beta-strand, there is a conserved aspartate residue that is involved in ribose binding. Since this segment is in contact with the ADP portion of dinucleotides such as FAD, NAD and NADP it is also called as an &quot;ADP-binding beta-beta fold.

== Function ==
The function of the Rossmann fold in enzymes is to bind nucleotide cofactors. It also often contributes to substrate binding.

Metabolic enzymes normally have one specific function, and in the case of UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, the primary function is to catalyze the two step NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid. The N- and C-terminal domains of UgdG share structural features with ancient mitochondrial ribonucleases named MAR. MARs are present in lower eukaryotic microorganisms, have a Rossmannoid-fold and belong to the isochorismatase superfamily. This observation reinforces that the Rossmann structural motifs found in NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenases can have a dual function working as a nucleotide cofactor binding domain and as a ribonuclease.

== Evolution ==

=== Rossman and Rossmannoids ===
The evolutionary relationship between the Rossmann fold and Rossmann-like folds is unclear. These folds are referred to as Rossmannoids. It has been hypothesized that all these folds, including a Rossmann fold originated from a single common ancestral fold, that had nucleotide binding capabilities, in addition to non-specific catalytic activity.

However, an analysis of the PDB finds evidence of convergent evolution with 156 separate H-groups of demonstrable homology, from which 123 X-groups of probable homology can be found. The groups have been integrated into ECOD.

=== Conventional Rossman group ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the NADP binding enzyme adrenodoxin reductase revealed that from prokaryotes, through metazoa and up to primates the sequence motif difference from that of most FAD and NAD-binding sites is strictly conserved.

In many articles and textbooks, a Rossmann fold is defined as a strict repeated series of βαβ structure. Yet, comprehensive examination of the Rossmann folds in many NAD(P) and FAD binding sites revealed that only the first βα structure is strictly conserved. In some enzymes, there may be many loops and several helices (i.e., not a single helix) between the beta strands that form the beta-sheet. These enzymes have a common origin indicated by conserved sequence and structural features, according to Hanukoglu.

The result by Hanukoglu (2017) is corroborated by Medvedev et al. (2020), in the form of an ECOD &quot;H-group&quot; called &quot;Rossmann-related&quot;. Even within this group, ECOD describes a wide range of non-nucleotide activities.

<text>Christopher I. Beckwith (born October 23, 1945) is an American philologist and distinguished professor in the Department of Central Eurasian Studies at Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana.

He has a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese from Ohio State University (1968), a Master of Arts in Tibetan from Indiana University Bloomington (1974) and a Doctor of Philosophy in Inner Asian Studies from Indiana University (1977).

Beckwith, a MacArthur Fellow, is a researcher in the field of Central Eurasian studies. He researches the history and cultures of ancient and medieval Central Asia. Concomitantly he specializes in Asian language studies and linguistics, and in the history of Central Eurasia. He teaches Old Tibetan, Central Eurasian languages, and Central Eurasian history and researches the linguistics of Aramaic, Chinese, Japanese, Koguryo, Old Tibetan, Tokharian, Old Turkic, Uzbek, and other languages.

His best-known works include &quot;Greek Buddha: Pyrrho&#x27;s Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia&quot; and &quot;Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present.&quot; &quot;Greek Buddha&quot; examines links between very early Buddhism and the philosophy of Pyrrho, an ancient Greek philosopher who accompanied Alexander the Great on his Indian campaign. The book is noted for its challenging and iconoclastic approach to multiple issues in the development of early Buddhism, Pyrrhonism, Daoism, Jainism and the Śramaṇa movement. &quot;Empires of the Silk Road&quot; is a rethinking of the origins, history, and significance of Central Eurasia. Beckwith&#x27;s methodologies and interpretations have been criticized by other scholars, such as Johannes Bronkhorst Osmund Bopearachchi Stephen Batchelor and Charles Goodman.

<doc id="964590" wikidata="Q7874855" url="?curid=964590" title="USS Trepang (SSN-674)">
<text>USS &quot;Trepang&quot; (SSN-674), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the trepang, &quot;Holothuroidea&quot;, a marine animal with a long, tough, muscular body.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Trepang&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 15 July 1966 and her keel was laid down there on 28 October 1967. She was launched on 27 September 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Melvin R. Laird, the wife of United States Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird, and commissioned on 14 August 1970.

==Service history==

=== 1970-1971 ===
Following local operations out of her home port, New London, Connecticut, &quot;Trepang&quot; proceeded to the Arctic early in 1971. From 22 February to 22 March 1971, she operated beneath the polar ice cap, conducting extensive tests to provide data for her weapons systems as well as carrying out scientific experiments concerning the movement, composition, and geological history of the ice cap itself.

After returning to New London via Faslane, Scotland, &quot;Trepang&quot; was soon deployed to the warmer climes of the Caribbean Sea, departing from New London on 22 April 1971 and subsequently making port at Frederiksted on St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands for weapons systems acceptance and evaluation trials. Back in New England waters for local operations, &quot;Trepang&quot; again headed south for further tests. In November 1971, she deployed to conduct independent operations in the North Atlantic Ocean.

=== 1972 ===
Following her return to New London on 5 February 1972, &quot;Trepang&quot; underwent a routine post-deployment standdown and upkeep, as well as attack submarine training and equipment grooming in local operating areas. She conducted a second extended deployment into the North Atlantic from 24 July to 25 September 1972, returning to New London via Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. For the remainder of 1972, she operated off the United States East Coast between New London and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

=== 1973 ===
An interim four-week drydocking period at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, preceded &quot;Trepang&quot;″s 1973 operations before she headed south for weapons tests off the Florida coast. Completing a four-week upkeep period on 22 April 1973, she completed a Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection before returning to New London, where she completed an Operational Reactor Safeguard Examination on 4 May 1973.

On 8 June 1973, &quot;Trepang&quot; departed New London for a six-month deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. She participated in several special operations with the Sixth Fleet during the increased tension brought on by the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East in October 1973. She returned to New London at the end of November 1973 for upkeep and the routine post-deployment standdown leave period.

=== 1974 ===
&quot;Trepang&quot; got underway on 15 February 1974 for a special operation which lasted through 9 April 1974. She then spent three days at Holy Loch, Scotland, before departing for New London. She continued local operations and training off the U.S. East Coast through her change of home port on 1 October 1974, when Portsmouth, New Hampshire, became her new base. She spent the remainder of 1974 in drydock in annual .

=== 1975 ===
While in overhaul, &quot;Trepang&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 10 during March 1975. She spent April to August 1975 completing the overhaul and carrying out crew training and recertification. Following sea trials in late October 1975, &quot;Trepang&quot; returned to New London, which once again became her home port, on 7 November for an intensive post-overhaul upkeep alongside submarine tender .

Departing New London on 1 December 1975, &quot;Trepang&quot; conducted post-overhaul weapons systems acceptance testing at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico and five days of acoustic trials off Frederiksted at St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands before departing St. Croix on 17 December 1975 and returning to New London on 22 December.

=== 1976 ===
&quot;Trepang&quot; spent the early part of 1976 preparing for an extended cruise. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea from June to November 1976, operating with the Sixth Fleet. She returned to New London upon conclusion of the deployment, and the routine post-deployment standdown lasted into 1977.

=== 1977 ===
In mid-January 1977, &quot;Trepang&quot; participated in Exercise &quot;CARIBEX 77&quot; in the Caribbean. She devoted the spring of 1977 to individual ship exercises which included a Nuclear Technical Proficiency Inspection, a Mk-48 Torpedo Proficiency Inspection, and an Operational Readiness Inspection, all of which she completed successfully. An extensive refit period, which included drydocking, took place in May and early June 1977. Midshipman orientation cruises followed and, in September, &quot;Trepang&quot; conducted pre-deployment work-up and certification. She then engaged in a training mission in the Atlantic Ocean from mid-October to mid-December 1977 before returning to New London and beginning a routine post-deployment standdown.

=== 1978 ===
After the standdown ended during January 1978, &quot;Trepang&quot; devoted the remainder of January, February, and March to attack submarine training and participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Exercise &quot;Safepass.&quot; She spent the summer of 1978 working up for a scheduled Mediterranean deployment. The deployment was subsequently cancelled to permit her to participate in a special Chief of Naval Operations project. She spent the remaining months of 1978 in the evaluation of equipment associated with that project, with periods at sea alternating with periods in port devoted to equipment maintenance.

In October 1978, the FBI arrested three men—two in St. Louis, one in New York—on charges of conspiring to steal the USS Trepang, based in New London, Ct. The FBI discovered the plot when Edward J. Mendenhall and James W. Cosgrove, two of the accused conspirators, contacted an undercover agent seeking funds for training and supplies. After stealing the submarine, the two intended to kill the crew, put out to sea, and rendezvous with an unidentified buyer.
She departed Groton on 27 November 1978 to conclude 1978 at sea conducting activities related to the special project.

=== 1979-1988 ===
In April 1985, &quot;Trepang&quot; deployed to the Arctic for -85. In addition, &quot;Trepang&quot; was deployed to assist U.S. Navy and civilian researchers for the Arctic Research and Environmental Acoustic (AREA) program. During this deployment, the ship surfaced at the North Pole on May 3, 1985. After four months in the Arctic, the &quot;Trepang&quot; sailed to HMNB Portsmouth before returning to its homeport, Naval Submarine Base New London, in Groton, Connecticut.
In 1987, &quot;Trepang&quot; completed a Mediterranean deployment. During this deployment, &quot;Trepang&quot; participated in exercises with the 6th Fleet. At this time, &quot;Trepang&quot; visited Toulon Arsenal in Toulon, France, and La Maddalena, Sardinia, Italy.

=== 1988-1991 ===
In 1988, &quot;Trepang&quot; visited Bermuda, earned the Battle &quot;E&quot; and visited Scotland following a Northern Atlantic deployment. After a change of command in November 1988, &quot;Trepang&quot; deployed on a two-month unsupported ASW mission to
the North Atlantic for which she was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. After completion of Pre-Overhaul Testing (POT), in March 1989 &quot;Trepang&quot; entered her first regular refueling overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. During the refueling overhaul &quot;Trepang&quot; completed the test program on-schedule and under budget. &quot;Trepang&quot; also maintained an effective &quot;Host City&quot; program with the city of Dover, NH. In recognition of the success of this and other community/education related programs she was awarded the 1990-1991 New Hampshire State Department of Education Community/School Partnership Award. Additionally &quot;Trepang&quot; was awarded the 1990 Silver Anchor Award for excellence in retention programs. In September 1991, after successful completion of her post overhaul sea trials she completed her refueling overhaul. Following a change of command in October 1991, &quot;Trepang&quot; then moved to her new home port of Charleston, South Carolina. During her voyage from Kittery, ME to Charleston, SC late in 1991 she transited beneath under the 1991 &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;.

=== 1991-1998===
During the remainder of her career, &quot;Trepang&quot; conducted many &quot;fast-attack submarine&quot; drill missions as well as a Mediterranean cruise interrupted by a stay of many weeks in La Maddalena, Italy, and Haifa, Israel. During her Mediterranean deployment, she participated in NATO operations Operation Sharp Guard off Bosnia-Herzegovina, became the first American submarine in history to perform peacetime operations with a German submarine—namely &quot;U-29&quot; (S178), conducted a secret mission tailing a drug-smuggling ship, and trained with SEAL Team 6.

During these years, one of &quot;Trepang&quot;″s sister ships, was considered her &quot;sister submarine,&quot; and the two often docked near one another.

In 1995, Trepang participated in joint exercises with the Chilean Navy.

&quot;Trepang&quot; conducted her final six-month deployment to the Mediterranean between June and December 1997. In late 1998, she circumnavigated the world in order to use up as much nuclear fuel as possible prior to decommissioning. She was awarded during this time the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (reasons unknown).

== Decommissioning and disposal ==
&quot;Trepang&quot; was decommissioned on 1 June 1999 at Bremerton, Washington, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton was completed on 7 April 2000.
Components of &#x27;Trepang&#x27;, including mess tables, crew bunks, and engineering, were used in the &quot;Fast Attacks and Boomers: Submarines in the Cold War&quot; exhibit at the Smithsonian Museum of American History from 2000 to 2003.

The rim of Walther is complex, heavily eroded and incised by lesser impacts. The wall retains a generally circular form, but many of its features have been worn away and there is a slight protruding bulge in the western rim. The floor has been resurfaced after the original impact, leaving the southwestern half relatively smooth. In the northwest quadrant is an offset central peak that has been worn and impacted by several small craters.

==Names==
Walther is named after the German astronomer Bernhard Walther. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was named (in the Latin form, &#x27;Valtherus&#x27;) by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names: Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Caroli I Reg. Britt.&quot;, after King Charles I of England, and Johannes Hevelius grouped it with Purbach and Regiomontanus as &quot;Mons Libanus&quot; after Mount Lebanon.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Walther.

<text>Kogarah () is a suburb of Southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Kogarah is located 14 kilometres (9 miles) south-west of the Sydney central business district and is considered to be the centre of the St George area.

==Location==
Kogarah took its name from Kogarah Bay, a small bay on the northern shore of the Georges River. The suburb originally stretched to the bay but has since been divided up to form the separate suburbs of Kogarah Bay and Beverley Park.

Kogarah has a mixture of residential, commercial and light industrial areas. It is also known for its large number of schools (including primary school, high school and tertiary education) and health care services (including two hospitals and many medical centres). The NRL side, St George Illawarra Dragons have their Sydney office based at nearby Jubilee Oval, often referred to as Kogarah Oval. Kogarah features all types of residential developments from low density detached houses, to medium density flats and high density high-rise apartments.

==History==

Kogarah is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;rushes or place of reeds&quot;. It had also been written as &#x27;Coggera&#x27;, &#x27;Cogerah&#x27; and &#x27;Kuggerah&#x27; but the current spelling was settled when the railway line came through the area in the 1880s.

Early land grants in the area were made to John Townson (1760–1835) who received from 1808 to 1810, centred on Hurstville and James Chandler, whose neighbouring estate was centred on Bexley. The district provided fruit, vegetables and oysters for Sydney. In 1869, St Paul&#x27;s Church of England opened on Rocky Point Road (now Princes Highway). It was built on of land given to the church by William Wolfen the Swedish Consul to Sydney, who owned in Kogarah. The suburb grew around the church and the Gardeners Arms Hotel. Kogarah became a municipality in 1885.

The former neighbourhood of Moorefield is now part of Kogarah. It was originally a land grant from Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1812 to Patrick Moore, who built a fine house there. The Moorefield racecourse built by a descendant opened in 1888. Brigadier General John Lamrock CB VD was appointed secretary of the Moorefield Race Club in 1912 and remained in that position until early in 1935. The Moorefield estate was subdivided in the 1950s and the Department of Education purchased , where it built two high schools and college of further education. Moorefields Girls High School was erected there in 1955 on the former site of Moore&#x27;s farm.

<doc id="964604" wikidata="Q1639238" url="?curid=964604" title="Newton (lunar crater)">
<text>Newton is a lunar impact crater located near the south limb of the Moon. It is south-southwest of the crater Moretus. To the northeast is Short, and in the northwest are Casatus and Klaproth. Because of its location, the crater appears highly oblong due to foreshortening. It is considered the deepest crater on the near side of the Moon.

The interior of Newton is a picture in contrasts. The southern end has been covered, possibly by lava flows or ejecta, leaving a relatively flat surface that is marked only by tiny craters and a slight wrinkle ridge down the middle. The northern half is rugged and irregular, with the satellite crater Newton D overlying the north-northeastern rim and extending across nearly half the crater diameter.

The rim in the south is relatively low and narrow, with the smaller crater Newton G partly overlain and flooded by lava. This adjacent crater forms a step up from the interior of Newton, and there is a tiny rille in the south floor of Newton where it appears as if a channel flowed down the side from Newton G. The other parts of the outer crater wall are much wider than in the south end, particularly in the areas adjacent to Newton D.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Newton.

<doc id="964610" wikidata="Q4944647" url="?curid=964610" title="Border states (Eastern Europe)">
<text>Border states, or European buffer states, were the European nations that won their independence from the Russian Empire after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and ultimately the defeat of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary in World War I. During the interwar period, the nations of Western Europe implemented a border states policy, which aimed at uniting them in protection against the Soviet Union and communist expansionism. The border states were interchangeably Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and, until their annexation into the Soviet Union, short-lived Belarus and Ukraine.

The policy tended to see the border states as a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, or buffer states, separating Western Europe from the newly formed Soviet Union. The policy was very successful. At the time, Soviet foreign policy was driven by the Trotskyist idea of permanent revolution, the end goal of which was to spread communism worldwide through perpetual warfare. However, the Soviet advance to the west was halted by Poland, which managed to defeat the Red Army during the Polish–Soviet War. After the war, Polish leader Józef Piłsudski made attempts to unify the border states under a federation called Intermarium, but disputes and different allegiances between and within the group of states prevented such a thing from happening, leaving them more susceptible to possible incursions by their more powerful neighbors. The matter was further complicated by the rise of the expansionist Nazi Germany to the west. In 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which included a secret clause that sanctioned the partitioning of several border states between the two regimes in the event of war. Only nine days after the pact was signed, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, and the Soviets followed suit shortly after, beginning World War II in Europe. After the end of the war, all border states except for Finland were transferred to Soviet occupation as a result of the Western betrayal although Finland had already ceded some of its territory to the Soviet Union following the Winter War.

<text>Irenaeus Frederic Baraga (June 29, 1797 – January 19, 1868; ) was a Slovenian Catholic missionary to the United States, grammarian and author of Christian poetry and hymns in Native American languages. He was the first Bishop of Sault Sainte Marie and Marquette, a post he held for 15 years.

His letters about his missionary work were published widely in Europe, inspiring the priests John Neumann and Francis Xavier Pierz to emigrate to the United States. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI declared him &quot;Venerable.&quot;

==Early life==
Frederic Baraga was born in the manor house at Mala Vas () no. 16 near the Carniolan village of Dobrnič, in what was then Lower Carniola, a province of the Duchy of Carniola in the Habsburg monarchy. Today it is a part of the Municipality of Trebnje in Slovenia. Never using his first name, he was baptized &quot;Irenaeus Fridericus Paraga&quot;.

He was the fourth of five children born to Janez Baraga and Marija Katarina Jožefa née Jenčič; among his siblings was his sister Antonija, who would later become the first Slovenian woman to immigrate to the United States. Upon her father&#x27;s death, his mother inherited an estate at Mala Vas, plus a substantial fortune. His mother died in 1808, and his father in 1812. Frederic spent his boyhood in the house of Jurij Dolinar, a lay professor at the diocesan seminary at Ljubljana.

Baraga grew up during the Napoleonic Wars, when France had taken over the Slovene Lands from the Austrian Empire for a time. As a result, the official language of instruction in his schools changed several times during his childhood between Slovenian and German. By the time he was nine, he was fluent in French as well. In addition, Latin and Greek were required subjects for all students. Thus, by age 16, Frederic Baraga was multilingual—a skill that would serve him well in later life.

==Priesthood==
Baraga attended law school at the University of Vienna, where he graduated in 1821. Influenced by Clement Mary Hofbauer, Baraga then entered the seminary in Ljubljana. At age 26, he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on September 21, 1823, in St. Nicholas Cathedral by Augustin Johann Joseph Gruber, the Bishop of Ljubljana. As a young priest, he was assigned as an assistant first at St. Martin&#x27;s near Kranj and later at Metlika in lower Carniola. Father Baraga was a staunch opponent of Jansenism. During this time, he wrote a spiritual book in Slovene entitled (Spiritual Sustenance).

In 1830 Baraga answered the request of Bishop Edward Fenwick of Cincinnati for priests to aid in ministering to his growing flock, which included a large mission territory. He left his homeland on October 29, 1830, and arrived in New York on December 31. He arrived in Cincinnati, Ohio, on January 18, 1831. During the winter and spring, he worked among the German immigrants in the area. At the same time, he studied the Ottawa language, a branch of the Algonquian languages. In May 1831 was sent to the Ottawa Indian mission at &quot;L&#x27;Arbre Croche&quot; (present-day Cross Village, Michigan) to finish his mastery of the language.
In 1837, he published , the first book written in the Ottawa language, which included a Catholic catechism and prayer book. After a brief stay at a mission in present-day Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1835, Baraga moved north to minister to the Ojibway (Chippewa) Indians at La Pointe, Wisconsin, at a former Jesuit mission on Lake Superior. He was joined by his sister Antonija.

In 1843 Baraga founded a mission at L&#x27;Anse, Michigan. During this time, he earned the nickname &quot;the Snowshoe Priest&quot; because he would travel hundreds of miles each year on snowshoes during the harsh winters. He worked to protect the Indians from being forced to relocate, as well as publishing a dictionary and grammar of the Ojibway language. Although these works have important historical value, they are not recommended as basic resources for the language today.

With the collaboration of many native speakers, Fr. Baraga also composed around 100 Catholic hymns in the Ojibwe language, which were published in a hymnal and still continue to be used by the Ojibwe people in Roman Catholic worship in both Canada and the United States.

Through the texts Baraga published in his missionary years, the Slovenes learned about aspects of Native American culture and the United States.

==Bishop==
Baraga was elevated to bishop by Pope Pius IX and consecrated November 1, 1853, in Cincinnati at Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral by Archbishop John Purcell. He was the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, now the Diocese of Marquette.

On June 27, 1852, he began to keep a diary, written in several languages (primarily German, but with English, French, Slovene, Chippewa, Latin, and Italian interspersed), preserving accounts of his missionary travels and his relationship with his sister Amalia. During this time, the area experienced a population explosion, as European immigrants were attracted to work in the copper and iron mines developed near Houghton, Ontonagon, and Marquette. This presented a challenge because he had few priests and attended to immigrant miners and the Native Americans. Increased development and population encouraged the improvement of transportation on Lake Superior.

The only way to travel in winter was on snowshoes, which Baraga continued to do into his sixties. He was particularly challenged by the vast diversity of peoples in the region, including the native inhabitants, ethnic French-Canadian settlers, and the new German and Irish immigrant miners. Difficulties in recruiting staff arose because of many languages; while Baraga spoke eight languages fluently, he had trouble recruiting priests who could do the same.

Baraga traveled twice to Europe to raise money for his diocese. He was presented a jeweled cross and episcopal ring by the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. The bishop later sold these for his missions.

Baraga wrote numerous letters to the Society for the Propagation of the Faith describing his missionary activities. The Society published them widely as examples of its missions in North America, and they were instrumental in inspiring the priests John Neumann and Francis Xavier Pierz to come to the United States to work. In time, Baraga became renowned throughout Europe for his work. In his last ten years, his health gradually declined; he became intermittently deaf and suffered a series of strokes. In 1865 Baraga wrote to Pope Pius IX in support of the canonization of his former confessor, Clement Hofbauer. He died January 19, 1868, in Marquette, Michigan. He is buried there in a chapel constructed for him at Saint Peter Cathedral; he formerly reposed with other bishops of Marquette in the cathedral crypt.

== Bishop Baraga House and Baraga Educational Center and Museum ==
The Bishop Baraga House is home to the Baraga Educational Center and Museum. It is located in Marquette, Michigan and is open to visitors daily (weather permitting). The current location of the house is not the original location. It was moved in 1872 to where it currently stands today.

The lot the house originally sat on was bought by Baraga from the Cleveland Mining Company for $250. Construction on the house began in 1857 and was completed in the same year. The building itself was intended to be used as a church. The first floor was where Mass was celebrated, and the second story had a living area typically for priests. The church was first pastored by Reverend Sebastian Duroc with Baraga visiting from time to time. However, in 1865, the Vatican approved a request to move the headquarters of the Catholic Diocese in Upper Michigan to Marquette. Thus in 1866, Baraga moved there permanently and lived there until his death in 1868. The Baraga House is known as the first permanent building in Marquette and was the first Catholic church in the city. The house changed ownership a few times in the subsequent years. In 1988, the house was sold back to the Catholic Church by the Wilfred Fleury estate. Since then, it has been taken care of by the Catholic Diocese of Marquette.

The Baraga Educational Center and Museum was first opened in 2018. A fundraising campaign was started in January 2018 to raise $500,000 to renovate the house and was opened in August of the same year. The house is home to artifacts, tools, and writings all used by Baraga during his time in ministry. The building also has a gift shop and the office space for the Bishop Baraga Association. In 2019, prayer gardens with stations of the cross were made available to the public.

<doc id="964614" wikidata="Q2079288" url="?curid=964614" title="Lucy Knight">
<text>Lucy Knight is a fictional character from the NBC television series &quot;ER&quot;, portrayed by actress Kellie Martin. The character was part of the show for the fifth and sixth seasons. When she was first introduced on &quot;ER&quot;, Dr. Doug Ross called her a &quot;by the book&quot; medical student. Kellie Martin&#x27;s image was removed from the main cast opening credits in the 15th episode of season 6.

==Conception and creation==
Prior to this role in &quot;ER&quot;, Martin was nicknamed &quot;One Take Kellie&quot;. She was not used to the medical jargon her character had to say, however, and claimed that it once took 12 takes to correctly pronounce &quot;renal vein thrombosis.&quot;

==Appearances==
===Season 5===

During season 5 Lucy is a third-year medical student. Dr. John Carter is quickly assigned as her resident while she completes her emergency room rotation. Knight and Carter vary between respectful and contentious interactions.

At the beginning of her rotation at County General, Lucy is popular with the attendings and nurses, who often treat her as another colleague. Lucy does run into trouble with Nurse Carol Hathaway after she asks for help with an IV. Lucy, unable to start an IV asks Carol for help and does not own up to Carter that she cannot start one until they end up in a trauma where she admits the truth. Carter is furious at her for lying to him and says if she ever does so again she will be off his rotation permanently. Lucy gets in trouble with Carter again after a Halloween party at her med school gets out of control and two students nearly die. Angry about work that has been thrown at him at the last minute, Carter leaves Lucy in charge of the party even though, as RA, that is his responsibility. Carter blames Lucy for him losing his RA position and they fight again when Carter overrules her on a case where Lucy&#x27;s judgment was correct, with Lucy then making comments on her Palm Pilot that Carter accidentally hears that describe his condescending treatment of her. 

Carter and Lucy eventually come to an agreement after the episode &quot;The Good Fight&quot; when the pair spend a day and evening searching for a little girl&#x27;s father who has the same extremely rare blood type as she does. Although the pair find the father, the girl&#x27;s condition remains critical and it is not clear whether the blood donation came in time to help save her. At the end of this episode, Carter and Lucy reconcile over the efforts they made. During this episode, Lucy reveals to Carter that she was brought up by her mother, and that she never knew her father.

During the episode &quot;The Storm: Part 1&quot;, Lucy accidentally kicks Carter while performing a work-out video with a patient in an exam room; he suffers a gash on his head. The pair later share a kiss in the x-ray room, but Carter ends their brief relationship because it is unethical for medical students and their residents to be romantically involved. Lucy&#x27;s rotation in the psych department goes exceptionally well, with the senior doctors there impressed with her results. This is the first time the show has a main character who starts out working in the ER but is shown to be a poor match for emergency medicine and a good match instead for a different medical field (a similar, longer path is traced starting in Season 10 for Neela Rasgotra, who is an uneven ER doctor but emerges over time as a superb surgeon).

Near the end of Season 5, it is revealed that Lucy is on Ritalin and has been since high school. Carter urges her to quit and she eventually does. When her performance at County begins to suffer, Lucy goes back on the Ritalin without telling Carter, and when he finds out and chides her, she bluntly says that she does not expect him to understand or care, since &quot;it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;ve never lived up to your expectations.&quot;

===Season 6===
Lucy&#x27;s role in the early episodes of season 6 is rather small, having only minor sub plots such as helping a young artist who is using cocaine and urging Dr. Dave Malucci to come forward and admit his possible mistake when using a Bunsen Burner that is thought to have caused an explosion in the ER.

Lucy clashes with nurse Carol Hathaway when they both make a plea for the last bed in a rehab clinic. The bed ultimately goes to Hathaway&#x27;s patient, which creates renewed friction between the pair when the patient does not show up for treatment. Lucy also clashes with Dr. Cleo Finch when Finch undermines Lucy&#x27;s judgment in regard to a young boy and his mother who both have alcohol abuse problems.

Lucy is finally able to come into her own and show her potential in the Christmas episode &quot;How the Finch Stole Christmas&quot; when patient Valerie Paige comes to the ER in desperate need of a heart transplant. Lucy goes above and beyond to ensure Valerie gets the life saving procedure - even going so far as to bang on Dr. Robert Romano&#x27;s door in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve. Though initially angry with her, Romano agrees to perform the operation after Lucy berates him for his seemingly flippant attitude towards the dying patient. Though she faces a reprimand from Romano, he seems to have more respect for her from then on.

Later in the episode &quot;The Domino Heart&quot;, Lucy is devastated when Valerie dies from complications after another surgery. This makes her ponder her time at County General and prompts her to give a moving speech to Dr. Luka Kovac about it: &quot;It&#x27;s never been very easy for me to be here, sometimes I felt like I would never fit in. But at the beginning of every day I have been grateful that I&#x27;m walking in here of my own choosing and not being carried in here on some gurney and at the end of every day if I have helped just one person, it&#x27;s been worth it. And that didn&#x27;t happen today and it makes me sad...&quot;. Kovac reminds her that her day is not yet over and that she may still help that one person. At that moment another patient arrives near the ambulance bay, and Kovac asks her to assist. The episode ends with the two of them rushing the patient into the ER and Kovac teaching Lucy procedures and asking her questions.

====Death====
In various interviews, Kellie Martin stated that she and the producers felt the character of Lucy was not working, so it was decided that Lucy would be written out of the show permanently. Martin also said that having family members face serious real-life medical issues nixed her interest in working on a medical show. On February 14, 2000, over the course of two episodes, &quot;Be Still My Heart&quot; and &quot;All In The Family&quot;, Paul Sobriki (played by David Krumholtz), a man with schizophrenia, checks into the emergency room. Lucy picks up on his mental problems, but Carter refuses to help her with the case and either ignores her accurate views of Paul&#x27;s state or openly scoffs at them. When she wants his help with getting the Psych Department to take a look at Paul, Carter dismissively says she should contact them and then pick up on other cases, leading her to angrily say &quot;Just forget it, Carter!&quot; and stop seeking his advice on the case. This is the last time they ever speak to each other.

While in a delusional state, Paul acquires a knife that was to be used to cut a Valentine&#x27;s Day cake and stabs Lucy multiple times before lying in wait for Carter. When Carter enters the room and sees a Valentine for Lucy on the floor, he picks it up and looks over it smiling just as Paul emerges from the shadows and stabs him twice before fleeing. Upon glancing at his blood-stained fingers, Carter goes into shock and hits the floor, gazing in surprise at Lucy lying in a pool of blood on the other side of the gurney. Both lose consciousness.

Both are later discovered by Dr. Kerry Weaver and immediately taken to the main trauma rooms to be treated. It is discovered that Lucy has received four serious stab wounds to her internal organs, lung, and neck. Although Weaver and Dr. Elizabeth Corday are able to stabilize Lucy in the ER, and Corday and Dr. Robert Romano are then able to repair her tissue damage, she soon develops complications, including a pulmonary embolism. Despite the heroic efforts of Drs. Corday and Romano, Lucy dies while in the catheter lab awaiting a Greenfield filter.

Lucy&#x27;s memorial service takes place in the episode &quot;Be Patient&quot;, although it is not seen on-screen and is apparently only attended by Jing-Mei Chen, who is there more as a representative of the ER than as a friend of Lucy&#x27;s. That same day, Lucy&#x27;s mother, Barbara Knight, arrives to clear out her locker. She eventually seeks Carter out and they spend the afternoon talking, with Mrs. Knight recounting how Lucy loved San Francisco but went to Chicago to practice medicine before she begins sobbing over her daughter&#x27;s death as Carter watches silently and sadly. Hoping to spare her the knowledge of Lucy&#x27;s suffering, he lies and says he did not actually feel pain when stabbed. Carter later talks to a few characters and says Lucy was a better doctor than he gave her credit for. He also says in the Season 6 finale &quot;May Day&quot; that Lucy&#x27;s death is &quot;partly my fault&quot;.

In the episode &quot;A Match Made In Heaven&quot;, a letter for Lucy arrives from a med school because she wasn&#x27;t taken off their registry after she was killed. She matched to County, and, had she lived, would have been given a position as a psych resident.

<text>Chinese architecture is the embodiment of an architectural style that has developed over millennia in China and has influenced architecture throughout East Asia. Since its emergence during the early ancient era, the structural principles of its architecture have remained largely unchanged. The main changes involved diverse decorative details. Starting with the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of neighbouring East Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia in addition to minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and the Philippines.

Chinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies), a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from &quot;pagodas&quot; to palaces. Due to the frequent use of wood, a relatively perishable material, as well as few monumental structures built of more durable materials, much historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published diagrams and specifications.

Although unifying aspects exist, Chinese architecture varies widely based on status or affiliation, such as whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in vernacular styles associated with different geographic regions and different ethnic heritages.

In more recent times, China has become the most rapidly modernizing country in the world. In the past few decades, cities like Shanghai have completely changed their skyline, with some of the worlds tallest skyscrapers dotting the horizon. China also has one of the most extensive high speed rail networks, connecting and allowing its large population to travel more efficiently.

Throughout the 20th century, Chinese architects have attempted to bring traditional Chinese designs into modern architecture. Moreover, the pressure for urban development throughout China requires high speed construction and a greater floor area ratio: thus, in cities the demand for traditional Chinese buildings (which are normally less than 3 levels) has declined in favor of high-rises. However, the traditional skills of Chinese architecture, including major and minor carpentry, masonry, and stonemasonry, are used in the construction of vernacular architecture in China&#x27;s rural areas.

==History==
===Neolithic and early antiquity===

Chinese civilizations and cultures developed in the plains along China&#x27;s numerous rivers that emptied into Bohai and Hongzhow bays. The most prominent of these rivers, the Yellow and the Yangtze, hosted many villages. The climate was warmer and more humid than today, allowing millet to be grown in the north and rice in the south. However, Chinese civilization has no single &quot;origin&quot;. Instead, it featured a gradual multinuclear development between 4000 and 2000 BC – from village communities to what anthropologists call cultures to states.

Two of the more important cultures were Hongshan culture (4700–2900 BC) to the north of Bohai Bay in Inner Mongolia and Hebei Province and contemporaneous Yangshao culture (5000–3000 BC) in Henan Province. Between the two, and developing later, was Longshan culture (3000–2000 BC) in the central and lower Yellow River valley. These combined areas gave rise to thousands of small/proto-states by 3000 BC. Some shared a common ritual center that linked them to a single symbolic order, but others developed more independently. The emergence of walled cities during this time is a clear indication that the political landscape was often unstable.

The Hongshan culture of Inner Mongolia (located along the Laoha, Yingjin, and Daling rivers that empty into Bohai Bay) was scattered over a large area but had a single, common ritual center of at least 14 burial mounds and altars over several ridges. It is dated to around 3500 BC, or possibly earlier. Although no evidence suggests village settlements nearby, its size is much larger than one clan or village could support. In other words, though rituals would have been performed there for the elites, the large area implies that audiences for the ritual would have encompassed all the villages of the Hongshan. As a sacred landscape, the center might have attracted supplicants from even further afield.

=== 20th century ===

Rammed earth construction was both practically and ideologically important during the rapid construction of the Daqing oil field and the related development of Daqing. The &quot;Daqing Spirit&quot; represented deep personal commitment in pursuing national goals, self-sufficient and frugal living, and urban-rural integrated land use. Daqing&#x27;s urban-rural landscape was said to embody the ideal communist society described by Karl Marx because it eliminated (1) the gap between town and country, (2) the gap between workers and peasants, and (3) the gap between manual and mental labor.

Drawing on the Daqing experience, China encouraged rammed earth construction in the mid-1960s. Starting in 1964, Mao Zedong advocated for a &quot;mass design revolution movement&quot;. In the context of the Sino-Soviet split, Mao urged that planners should avoid the use of Soviet-style prefabricated materials and instead embrace the proletarian spirit of on-site construction using rammed earth. The Communist Party promoted the use of rammed earth construction as a low-cost method which was indigenous to China and required little technical skill.

Reinforced concrete, brick-infill, and prefabricated materials were used increasingly following the Wall Reform Movement of 1973–1976 and were promoted in publications such as &quot;Architectural Journal.&quot;

In 2014, the city of Datong started to rebuild the Datong ancient city wall and buildings in traditional architecture, although received skepticism and opposition by citizens by then, many praised the mayor for bringing back traditional Chinese aesthetics later on..Starting with the Northern Wei dynasty 1,600 years ago, Datong was a beautiful capital. It continued to thrive in the Liao and Jin dynasties, and later regained prominence as a major strategic centre in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

== Geography ==
Vernacular Chinese architecture shows variations related to local terrain and climate.

==Features==
===Bilateral symmetry===
An important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on articulation and bilateral symmetry, which there signifies balance. These are found everywhere in Chinese architecture, from palace complexes to humble farmhouses. Secondary elements are positioned on either side of the main structures as wings to maintain overall symmetry. Buildings are typically planned to contain an even number of columns to produce an odd number of bays (間). Placing the main door in the center bay maintains symmetry.

In contrast to buildings, Chinese gardens tend to be asymmetrical. Gardens are designed to provide enduring flow. The design of the classic Chinese garden is based on the ideology of &quot;Nature and Man in One&quot;, as opposed to the home itself, which shows the human sphere co-existing with, but separate from nature. The intent is that people feel surrounded by, and in harmony with, nature. The two essential garden elements are stones and water. The stones signify the pursuit of immortality, while water represents emptiness and existence. The mountain belongs to &quot;yang&quot; (static beauty), and the water belongs to &quot;yin&quot; (dynamic wonder). They depend on each other and complete each other.

===Enclosure===
In much Chinese architecture, buildings or building complexes surround open spaces. These enclosed spaces come in two forms:
*&quot;Courtyard (院)&quot;: Open courtyards are a common feature in many projects. This is best exemplified in Siheyuan: It consisted of an empty space surrounded by buildings connected with one another either directly or through verandas.
*&quot;&quot;Sky well&quot; (天井)&quot;: Although large open courtyards are less commonly found in southern Chinese architecture, the concept of an &quot;open space&quot; surrounded by buildings can be seen in the southern building structure known as the &quot;sky well&quot;. This structure is essentially a relatively enclosed courtyard formed from the intersections of closely spaced buildings and offers a small opening to the sky through the roof space.

These enclosures aid in temperature regulation and in ventilation. Northern courtyards are typically open and face south to allow the maximum exposure of the building windows and walls to the sun while keeping out the cold north winds. Southern sky wells are relatively small and collect rainwater from the roof tops. They perform the same duties as the Roman impluvium while restricting the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Sky wells also vent hot air skyward, which draws cool air from the lower areas and the outside.

===Hierarchy===

The projected hierarchy and importance and building uses in Chinese architecture are based on the strict placement of buildings in a property/complex. Buildings with doors facing the front of the property are considered more important than those facing the sides. Buildings facing away from the front are the least important.

South-facing buildings in the rear and more private areas with higher exposure to sunlight are held in lower esteem and reserved for elders or ancestral plaques. Buildings facing east and west are generally for junior members or branches of the family, while buildings near the front are typically for servants and hired help.

Front-facing buildings in the back of properties are used for celebratory rites and for the placement of ancestral halls and plaques. In multi-courtyard complexes, central courtyards and their buildings are considered more important than peripheral ones, the latter typically for storage, servants&#x27; rooms, or kitchens.

===Horizontal emphasis===
Classical Chinese buildings, especially those of the wealthy, are built with an emphasis on breadth and less on height, featuring an enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls deemphasized. Buildings that were too high and large were considered unsightly, and therefore generally avoided. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings, using sheer scale to inspire awe. This preference contrasts with Western architecture, which tends to emphasize height and depth. This often meant that pagodas towered above other buildings.

The halls and palaces in the Forbidden City have rather low ceilings when compared to equivalent stately buildings in the West, but their external appearance suggests the all-embracing nature of imperial China. These ideas have found their way into modern Western architecture, for example through the work of Jørn Utzon.

===Cosmological concepts===
Chinese architecture used concepts from Chinese cosmology such as &quot;feng shui&quot; (geomancy) and Taoism to organize construction and layout. These include:
* Screen walls to face the main entrance, which stems from the belief that evil things travel in straight lines.
* Talismans and imagery of good fortune:
** Door gods displayed on doorways to ward off evil and encourage good fortune
** Three anthropomorphic figures representing Fu Lu Shou (福祿壽 fú-lù-shòu) stars are prominently displayed, sometimes with the proclamation &quot;the three stars are present&quot; (三星宅 sān-xīng-zhài)
** Animals and fruits that symbolize good fortune and prosperity, such as bats and pomegranates, respectively. The association is often done through rebuses.
* Orienting the structure with its back to an elevated landscape and placing water in the front. 
* Ponds, pools, wells, and other water sources are built into the structure.
* Aligning a building along a north–south axis, with the building facing south (in the north where the wind is coldest in winter). The two sides face east and west respectively. The back of the structure is generally windowless.

The use of certain colors, numbers and the cardinal directions reflected the belief in a type of immanence, where the nature of a thing could be wholly contained in its own form.

Beijing and Chang&#x27;an are examples of traditional Chinese town planning that represent these cosmological concepts.

==Architectural types==

The types of Chinese architecture may relate to the use of the structures, such as whether they were built for royals, commoners, or the religious.

=== Commoners ===
Due to primarily wooden construction and poor maintenance, far fewer examples of commoner&#x27;s homes survive compared to those of nobles. Korman claimed the average commoner&#x27;s home did not change much, even centuries after the establishment of the universal style: early-20th-century homes were similar to late and mid-imperial homes.

These homes tended to follow a set pattern: the center of the building was a shrine for deities and ancestors, and was also used during festivities. On its two sides were bedrooms for elders; the two wings (known as &quot;guardian dragons&quot;) were for junior members, as well as the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen, although sometimes the living room was close to the center.

Sometimes the extended families became so large that one or two extra pairs of &quot;wings&quot; had to be built. This produced a U-shape, with a courtyard suitable (e.g., for farm work). Merchants and bureaucrats preferred to close off the front with an imposing gate. All buildings were legally regulated, and the law required that the number of stories, the length of the building and the building colours reflect the owner&#x27;s class.

Some commoners living in areas plagued by bandits built communal fortresses called Tulou for protection. Often favoured by the Hakka in Fujian and Jiangxi, the design of Tulou shows the ancient philosophy of harmony between people and environment. People used local materials, often building the walls with rammed earth. No window reached the outside on the lower two floors (for defense), but the inside included a common courtyard and let people gather.

===Imperial===


Certain architectural features were reserved for buildings built for the emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow (the imperial color) roof tiles. Yellow tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the Forbidden City. Only the emperor could use hip roofs, with all four sides sloping. The two types of hip roof were single-eave and double-eave. The Hall of Supreme Harmony is the archetypal example of double eaves. The Temple of Heaven uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets (&quot;dougong&quot;), a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The building&#x27;s wooden columns well as the wall surfaces, tend to be red. Black is often used in pagodas. It was believed that the gods were inspired by the black color to visit earth.

The 5-clawed dragon, adopted by the Hongwu emperor (first emperor of Ming dynasty) for his personal use, was used to decoration the beams, pillars, and on the doors on imperial architecture. Curiously, the dragon was never used on roofs of imperial buildings.

Only buildings used by the imperial family were allowed to have nine &quot;jian&quot; (間, space between two columns); only gates used by the emperor could have five arches, with the centre one, reserved for the emperor. The ancient Chinese favored the color red.

Beijing became the capital of China after the Mongol invasion of the 13th century, completing the easterly migration of the Chinese capital begun in the Jin dynasty. The Ming uprising in 1368 reasserted Chinese authority and fixed Beijing as the seat of imperial power for the next five centuries. The emperor and the empress lived in palaces on the central axis of the Forbidden City, the crown prince at the eastern side, and the concubines at the back (the imperial concubines were often referred to as &quot;The Back Palace Three Thousand&quot;). During the mid-Qing dynasty, the emperor&#x27;s residence was moved to the western side of the complex. It is misleading to speak of an axis in the Western sense of a visual perspective ordering facades. The Chinese axis is a line of privilege, usually built upon, regulating access—instead of vistas, a series of gates and pavilions are used.

Numerology influenced imperial architecture, hence the use of nine (the greatest single digit number) in much of construction and the reason why the Forbidden City in Beijing is said to have 9,999.9 rooms—just short of heaven&#x27;s mythical 10,000 rooms. The importance of the East (the direction of the rising sun) in orienting and siting imperial buildings is a form of solar worship found in many ancient cultures, reflecting the affiliation of Ruler with the Sun.

The tombs and mausoleums of imperial family members, such as the 8th-century Tang dynasty tombs at the Qianling Mausoleum, can be counted as part of the imperial tradition. These above-ground earthen mounds and pyramids had subterranean shaft-and-vault structures that were lined with brick walls since at least the Warring States period (481–221 BC).

===Religious===

Generally speaking, Buddhist architecture follows the imperial style. A large Buddhist monastery normally has a front hall, housing the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings, followed by a great hall, housing statues of the Buddhas. Accommodations are located at the two sides. Some of the greatest examples of this come from the 18th-century Puning Temple and Putuo Zongcheng Temple. Buddhist monasteries sometimes also have pagodas, which may house relics of the Gautama Buddha; older pagodas tend to be four-sided, while later pagodas usually have eight sides.

Daoist architecture usually follows the commoners&#x27; style. The main entrance is, however, usually at the side, out of superstition about demons that might try to enter the premise (see feng shui.) In contrast to the Buddhists, in a Daoist temple the main deity is located in the main hall at the front, with lesser deities in the back hall and at the sides. This is because Chinese people believe that even after the body has died, the soul is still alive. From the Han grave design, it shows the forces of cosmic yin/yang, the two forces from the heaven and earth that create eternity.

The tallest pre-modern building in China was built for both religious and martial purposes. The Liaodi Pagoda of 1055 AD stands at a height of , and although it served as the crowning pagoda of the Kaiyuan monastery in old Dingzhou, Hebei, it was also used as a military watchtower for Song dynasty soldiers to observe potential Liao dynasty troop movements.

The architecture of the mosques and &quot;gongbei&quot; tomb shrines of Chinese Muslims often combines traditional Chinese styles with Middle Eastern influences. The royal and nonroyal tombs found in the third through sixth centuries traced back to Han construction. Some tombs were considered two-chamber spaces, where the focal point was the central pagoda pillar. This focal point served as what Buddhist call a pagoda, which is a symbol of the Buddha and his death. The layout of such tombs has the corpse in the back chamber, as the pillar location indicated the Buddha&#x27;s death. There would sometimes be interior tomb decoration to portray immortal or divine meaning.

Dome ceilings in the 4th and 7th centuries were representations of the heavens. This originates from Roman provincial art and ancient Egypt. As most of these representations are circular, other forms are present: dodecagon, octagonal, and square. Many caves in the 4th-7th centuries were probably carved throughout the Han and Tang period.

==Urban planning==

Chinese urban planning is based on fengshui geomancy and the well-field system of land division, both used since the Neolithic age. The basic well-field diagram is overlaid with the &quot;luoshu&quot;, a magic square divided into 9 sub-squares, and linked with Chinese numerology. In Southern Song dynasty (1131AD), the design of Hongcun city in Anhui was based around &quot;harmony between man and nature&quot;, facing south and surrounded by mountains and water. According to fengshui, it is a carefully planned ancient village and shows the Human-Nature Intergraded Ecological Planning concept.

Since wars were frequent in northern China, many people moved to southern China. The building method of a courtyard house was adapted to southern China. The village of Tungyuan in Fujian Province is a good example of a planned settlement that shows the feng shui elements – psychological self-defense and building structure – in the form of material self-defense.

==Construction==

===Materials and history===

Wood was typically utilised as a primary building material. Also, Chinese culture holds that life connects with nature and that humans should interact with animated things. By contrast stone was associated with the homes of the dead. However, unlike other building materials, wooden structures are less durable. The Songyue Pagoda (built in 523) is China&#x27;s oldest extant &quot;pagoda&quot;; its use of brick instead of wood allowed it to endure across the centuries. From the Tang dynasty (618–907) onwards, brick and stone architecture gradually became more common. The earliest examples of this transition can be seen in building projects such as the Zhaozhou Bridge completed in 605 or the Xumi Pagoda built in 636. Some stone and brick architecture was used in subterranean tomb architecture of earlier dynasties.

In the early 20th century no known fully wood-constructed Tang dynasty buildings still existed; the oldest so far discovered was the 1931 find of Guanyin Pavilion at Dule Monastery, dated 984 during the Song dynasty. Later architectural historians Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin, Mo Zongjiang, discovered that the Great East Hall of Foguang Temple on Mount Wutai in Shanxi dated to 857. The ground floor of this monastic hall measures . The main hall of nearby Nanchan Temple on Mount Wutai was later dated to 782. Six Tang era wooden buildings had been found by the 21st century. The oldest intact fully wooden pagoda is the Pagoda of Fogong Temple of the Liao dynasty, located in Ying County of Shanxi. While the East Hall of Foguang Temple features seven types of bracket arms in its construction, the 11th-century Pagoda of Fogong Temple features fifty-four.
The earliest walls and platforms used rammed earth construction. Ancient sections of the Great Wall of China used brick and stone, although the brick and stone Great Wall seen today is a Ming dynasty renovation.

Buildings for public use and for elites usually consisted of earth mixed with bricks or stones on raised platforms which allowed them to survive. The earliest of this sort of construction was during the Shang dynasty ( – 1046 BCE)

===Structure===


*&quot;Ceilings:&quot; The form that served greatest interest was the English vault or dome. The ceiling had the appearance of posed of flat beams, diagonal-support planks (xiecheng banliang), broken-line wedge shaped with a plank inserted, tongue-and-groove joints, barrel vault, or a domical vault. Most of this construction would be done with wood.
*&quot;Foundation&quot;: Most buildings typically use raised platforms (臺基) as their foundations. Vertical structural beams may rest on stone pedestals (柱础) that occasionally rest on piles. In lower class construction, the platforms are constructed of rammed earth, either unpaved or paved with brick or ceramics. In the simplest cases vertical structural beams are driven into the ground. Upper class constructions typically sit on raised stone-paved rammed earth or stone foundations with ornately carved heavy stone pedestals for supporting large vertical structural beams. The beams remain on their pedestals solely by friction and the weight of the building structure.
**&quot;Framing:&quot; Dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries, timber framing is evident in cave-temples like Mogao, Yungang, Maijishan and Tianlongshan. Most of these caves use the same method: eight sided columns, two-plate capitals, and alternating bracket arms and V-shaped braces. Whether or not certain structural supports were included was entirely up to what the artisans chose. There were no symbolic meanings behind these designs.
*&quot;Structural beams&quot;: Large structural timbers support the roof. Timber, usually large trimmed logs, are used as load-bearing columns and lateral beams. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied through the use of brackets. These structural timbers are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how ancient builders raised the columns into position.
*&quot;Structural connections&quot;: Timber frames are typically constructed with joinery and dowelling, seldom with glue or nails. These types of semi-rigid structural joints allow the timber structure to resist bending and torsion under high compression. Structural stability is enhanced through the use of heavy beams and roofs. The lack of glue or nails in joinery, the use of non-rigid support such as dougong, and the use of wood as structural members allow the buildings to slide, flex, and hinge while absorbing shock, vibration, and ground shifts from earthquakes without significant damage. The rich decorated the Dougong with valuable materials to display their wealth. Common people used artwork to express their appreciation to the house.
*&quot;Walls&quot;: Curtain walls or door panels delineated rooms or enclosed a building, with the general de-emphasis of load-bearing walls in most higher class construction. However, later dynasties faced a shortage of trees, leading to the use of load-bearing walls in non-governmental or religious construction, made of brick and stone.
*&quot;Roofs&quot;: Flat roofs are uncommon while gabled roofs are omnipresent. Roofs are either built on roof cross-beams or rest directly on vertical structural beams. In higher class construction, roof beams are supported through complex dougong bracketing systems that indirectly connect them to the primary structural beams. The three main types of roofs are:
**&quot;Straight inclined&quot;: Roofs with a single incline. These are the most economical and are most prevalent in commoner structures.
**&quot;Multi-inclined&quot;: Roofs with 2 or more sections of incline. These roofs are used in higher class constructions.
**&quot;Sweeping&quot;: Roofs with a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners. This type is usually reserved for temples and palaces although it may also be found in the homes of the wealthy. In the former cases, the roof ridges are usually highly decorated with ceramic figurines.
*&quot;Roof apex&quot;: The roof apex of a large hall is usually topped with a ridge of tiles and statues for decorative purposes as well as to weigh down the tiles for stability. These ridges are often well decorated, especially for religious or palatial structures. In some regions, the ridges are sometimes extended or incorporated into the walls of the building to form &quot;matouqiang&quot; (horse-head walls), which served as a fire deterrent from drifting embers.
*&quot;Roof top decorations&quot;: Symbolism can be found in the colors of the eaves, roofing materials and roof top decorations. Gold/yellow is an auspicious (good) color, imperial roofs are gold or yellow. Green roofs symbolize bamboo shafts, which in turn represent youth and longevity.
**&quot;Patterns, decoration, elaboration, and ornament:&quot; all signatures dating back to Chinese architecture from the 5th and 6th century. Many cave temples demonstrate such practice. Studies find that certain patterns were repeated often in different locations across different dynasties. It was also found that designs found in western Asian art travelled to patterns found in Chinese timber.

==Classification by structure==
Chinese classifications for architecture include:
*亭 () &quot;ting&quot; (Chinese pavilions)
*臺 () &quot;tai&quot; (terraces)
*樓 () &quot;lou&quot; (multistory buildings)
*閣 () &quot;ge&quot; (two-story pavilions)
*軒 (轩) &quot;xuan&quot; (verandas with windows)
*塔 &quot;ta&quot; (Chinese pagodas)
*榭 &quot;xie&quot; (pavilions or houses on terraces)
*屋 &quot;wu&quot; (Rooms along roofed corridors)
*斗拱 () &quot;dougong&quot; interlocking wooden brackets, often used in clusters to support roofs and add ornamentation.
*藻井 &quot;Caisson&quot; domed or coffered ceiling
*宮 () &quot;palaces&quot;, larger buildings used as imperial residences, temples, or centers for cultural activities.

==Miniature models==

Although mostly only ruins of brick and rammed earth walls and towers from ancient China (i.e. before the 6th century AD) survive, information on ancient Chinese architecture (especially wooden architecture) can be discerned from clay models of buildings created as funerary items. This is similar to the paper joss houses burned in some modern Chinese funerals. The following models were made during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220):
During the Jin dynasty (266–420) and the Six Dynasties, miniature models of buildings or entire architectural ensembles were often made to decorate the tops of the so-called &quot;soul vases&quot; (&quot;hunping&quot;), found in many tombs of that period.

==Culture==
Beyond China&#x27;s physically creative architecture techniques lies an &quot;imaginary architecture&quot;. This imaginary architecture reflected three major principles that carry messages about the relations between inhabitants, society, and the cosmos, and that depict gender power imbalances.

=== Confucius ===
The first design principle was that the Chinese house was the embodiment of Neo-Confucian values. These collaborative values were loyalty, respect, and service. They were depicted through representations of generations, gender, and age. Unlike western homes, the Chinese home was not a private space or a place separated from the state. It was a community in itself that sheltered a patrilineal kinship clan. It was quite common for houses to shelter &quot;five generations under one roof&quot;. Social concepts reflected the Five Relationships between &quot;ruler and subject, father and child, husband and wife, elder and younger brother and friends.&quot; The unequal relationship between the superior and subordinate in these relationships was emphasized. The relationship between husband and wife was patriarchal. The husband was required to treat the spouse with kindness, consideration, and understanding.

=== Cosmic space ===
The Chinese house was a cosmic space. The house was designed as a shelter to foil evil influences by channeling cosmic energies (&quot;qi&quot;) by respecting feng shui. Depending on the season, astral cycle, landscape, and the house&#x27;s design, orientation, and architectural details, some amount of energy would be produced. However, cosmic energy could be used in both moral and immoral ways. The moral way is by adding feng shui to a local community temple. Feng shui could also be used competitively to raise the value of one&#x27;s house at the expense of others. For example, if someone built part of their house against the norm, their house could be considered a threat, because it was recklessly throwing off cosmic energy. In one detailed account, a fight broke out over feng shui.

Feng shui was also incorporated inside the home. Symmetry, orientations, arrangements of objects, and cleanliness were important factors to direct cosmic energy. Even in poorer homes cleanliness and tidiness were highly desired to compensate for the lack of space. Sweeping was a daily task that was thought to be a purifying act. Chinese historian Sima Guang writes, &quot;The servants of the inner and outer quarters and the concubines all rise at the first crow of the cock. After combing their hair, washing, and getting dressed, the male servants should sweep the halls and front courtyard; the doorman and older servants should sweep the middle courtyard, while the maids sweep the living quarters, arrange tables and chairs, and prepare for the toilet of the master and mistress.&quot; The task of cleaning further illustrates, the gender segregation of the Chinese household.

=== Culture ===
The house was a space of culture that depicted the Chinese view of humanity. The house was a domestic domain, separated from the undomesticated world. The separation was commonly realized through walls and gates. Gates were first a physical barrier and second a notice board.

The home was where family rules could be enforced, dividing the upbringing of the inhabitants.

Women were often hidden away within the inner walls to perform domestic duties, while men would freely interact with the outside.

While brides entered an unknown and potentially hostile environment, the husband &quot;never had to leave his parents or his home, he knew which lineage and which landscape he belonged to from the time he began to understand the world.&quot; New brides were typically treated badly by senior household members. Junior brides might be treated like unpaid servants and forced to do unpleasant chores. Bray characterized marriage as the bride&#x27;s descent into hell. &quot;The analogy of the wedding process with death is made explicit: the bride describes herself as being prepared for death, and the wedding process as the crossing of the yellow river that is the boundary between this life and the next. She appeals for justice, citing the valuable and unrecognized contribution she has made to her family. Her language is bitter and unrestrained, and she even curses the matchmaker and her future husband&#x27;s family. Such lamenting can take place only within her parents&#x27; household and must cease halfway on the road to her new home, when the invisible boundary has been crossed.&quot; Women were fully accepted into a new home only after bearing a child.

The confinement of women was also a method of controlling their sexual lives. Confinement was used to prevent impregnation by an outsider who might thereby claim a slice of the family&#x27;s wealth. Bray claimed that wives were often represented as &quot;gossiping troublemakers eager to stir up strife between otherwise devoted brothers, the root of family discord, requiring strict patriarchal control.&quot;

Husbands and wives did not stay in the same private room for long periods. During the day, men would go out or work in their studies, avoiding unnecessary contact with female relatives. Women were generally confined to the inner perimeter. When leaving the inner perimeter, they must cover their face with a veil or a sleeve. Conversely, men were not usually permitted to enter the inner perimeter, providing women some control over their daily experience.

==Influence from outside of China==
Some Chinese mosques architecture received influence from abroad, particularly during dynasties such as the Yuan, which were more outward-facing. The arrival of many Muslim officials, architects and scholars from the Islamic world during the Yuan dynasty led to an influx of Islamic elements, especially in Chinese mosques.

The Zhenghai Mosque in Ningbo is an example of Islamic architecture that appeared in China during the Song dynasty. When Arabic traders settled in Ningbo, they spread Muslim culture and built a mosque. Later, mosques were built around Beijing. The mosques of Xi&#x27;an such as Xi&#x27;an Great Mosque and Daxuexi Alley Mosque reflected similar influences. Beijing&#x27;s mosques follow essentially the norms of Chinese layout, design, and traditional wooden structure.

Many miniature &quot;pagodas&quot; exist in Northeast China. They were built by Buddhists during the Liao dynasty (907–1125), which supported Buddhism. They developed Buddhist architecture that used bricks. Many such pagodas spread from Hebei Province to Beijing and Inner Mongolia.

==Influence beyond China==
Chinese architecture has influenced the architecture of many other East Asian countries. During the Tang dynasty, much Chinese culture was imported by neighboring nations. Chinese architecture had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam where the East Asian hip-and-gable roof design is ubiquitous.

Chinese architecture influenced the architecture of various Southeast Asian countries. Chinese architectural elements were adopted by Thai artisans after trade commenced with the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Temple and palace roof tops adopted Chinese-style. Chinese-style buildings can be found in Ayutthaya, a nod towards the many Chinese shipbuilders, sailors and traders who came to the country. In Indonesia, mosques bearing Chinese influence can be found. This influence is recent in comparison to other parts of Asia and is largely due to the Chinese Indonesian community.

In South Asia, Chinese architecture played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan architecture, alongside influences from other parts of Southeast Asia. The Kandyan roof style, for example bears many similarities to the East Asian hip-and-gable roof technique.

The Chinese-origin guardian lion is also found in front of Buddhist temples, buildings and some Hindu temples (in Nepal) across Asia including Japan, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and Laos.

==Regional variation==
Chinese architecture varied across regions. Several of the more notable regional styles include:

===Hui Style architecture===
===Shanxi architecture===
Shanxi preserves the oldest wooden structures in China from Tang dynasty, including the Foguang Temple and Nanchan Temple. Yungang Grottoes in Datong and numerous Buddhist temples in the sacred Mount Wutai exemplify Chinese religious architecture. Shanxi family compounds are representative of vernacular architecture in North China. In the mountainous areas of Shanxi, &quot;yaodong&quot; is a type of earth shelter that is commonly found.
===Lingnan (Cantonese) architecture===
Classical Lingnan architecture is used primarily in Guangdong and the eastern half of Guangxi. It is noted for its use of carvings and sculptures for decorations, green brick, balconies, &quot;Cold alleys&quot;, &quot;Narrow doors&quot;, and many other characteristics adaptive to the subtropical region.
===Minnan (Hokkien) architecture===
Minnan architecture, or Hokkien architecture, refers to the architectural style of the Hoklo people, the Han Chinese group who are the dominant demographic of Southern Fujian and Taiwan. This style is noted for its use of swallowtail roofs (heavily decorated upward-curving roof ridges) and &quot;cut porcelain carving&quot; for decorations. The swallowtail roof is a signature of Hokkien architecture, commonly used for religious buildings like shrines and temples, but also in dwellings. Hokkien architecture is dominated by decorations from carvings of natural elements like plants and animals, or figures from Chinese mythology.
===Teochew architecture===
Teochew architectural is the architectural style of the Teochew people, who come from the Chaoshan region of Guangdong province. Teochew architecture is categorised by its &quot;curly grass roofs&quot; (with the ridges curving into a loop) and wood carvings, and share the &quot;cut porcelain carving&quot; tradition with the closely related Hokkien people.
===Hakka architecture===

Hakka people are noted for building distinctive walled villages in order to protect themselves from clan wars.
===Gan architecture===

The Gan Chinese-speaking province of Jiangxi makes use of bricks, wood, and stones as materials, primarily using wooden frames. 
=== Sui architecture ===

During the Sui period in the 7th century, structures were carved in the Hebei mountains. These structures had a quadrilateral ground plan with intent for a cubic interior. Pillars inside would be octagonal. Another feature included mullioned windows. Plus, there were anterooms, which were small Buddhist caves.
===Yaodong architecture===

The Jin Chinese cultural area of Shanxi and northern Shaanxi is noted for carving homes into the sides of mountains. The soft rock of the Loess Plateau in this region makes an excellent insulating material.

===Tibetan architecture===
===Xinjiang architecture===
Early architecture

Early Xinjiang architecture was influenced by Buddhist, Manichaean, Sogdian, Uyghur and Chinese cultural groups, most prominent examples including the cave temples of Bezeklik; religious and residential buildings at Jiahoe; and temples and shrines at Gaochang.

Islamic architecture

The first Muslims came to Xinjiang in the eighth or ninth centuries CE, yet only became a significant presence during the Yuan dynasty.

Islam came to Hami province in eastern Xinjiang at the end of the fourteenth century, and the province&#x27;s first mosque was built in 1490, with ten generations of Muslim kings of Hami buried in the complex from the 1690s to 1932. The mausoleum complex of Hami was built in 1840 – the tomb of King Boxi&#x27;er is the complex&#x27;s most prominent feature, having been constructed after the Muslim rebellion of 1867.

The mud-brick Emin Minaret (or Sugongta) in Turpan province is 44 metres (144 ft) tall is the tallest minaret in China. The tower is decorated with sixteen patterns on the exterior, with textured bricks carved into intricate, repetitive, geometric and floral mosaic patterns, such as stylized flowers and rhombuses. The minaret was started in 1777 during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796) and was completed only one year later.

===Others===
Other regional styles include Hutong, found in northern China, Longtang and Shikumen of Haipai (Shanghainese) architecture.

<doc id="964618" wikidata="Q1544219" url="?curid=964618" title="Great American Novel">
<text>The Great American Novel (sometimes abbreviated as GAN) is the term for a canonical novel that generally embodies and examines the essence and character of the United States. The term was coined by John William De Forest in an 1868 essay and later shortened to GAN. De Forest noted that the Great American Novel had most likely not been written yet.

Practically, the term refers to a small number of books that have historically been the nexus of discussion, including &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851), &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884), &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1925), and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1936). Exactly what novel or novels warrant the title is without consensus and an assortment have been contended as the idea has evolved and continued into the modern age, with fluctuations in popular and critical regard. William Carlos Williams, Clyde Brion Davis and Philip Roth have written novels about the Great American Novel—titled as such—Roth&#x27;s in the 1970s, a time of prosperity for the concept.

Equivalents to and interpretations of the Great American Novel have arisen. Writers and academics have commented upon the term&#x27;s pragmatics, the different types of novels befitting of title and the idea&#x27;s relation to race and gender.

==History==

=== Background and origin of the term===
The development of American literature coincided with the nation&#x27;s development, especially of its identity. Calls for an &quot;autonomous national literature&quot; first appeared during the American Revolution, and, by the mid-19th century, the possibility of American literature exceeding its European counterparts began to take shape, as did that of the Great American Novel, this time being the genesis of novels that would later be considered the Great American Novel.

The term &quot;Great American Novel&quot; originated in an 1868 essay by American Civil War novelist John William De Forest. De Forest saw it serving as a &quot;tableau&quot; of American society, and said that the novel would &quot;paint the American soul&quot; and capture &quot;the ordinary emotions and manners of American existence&quot;. Similarly, Daniel Pierce Thompson said it had to be distinctly American. Although De Forest espoused praise and critique for contemporaneous novels, he ultimately concluded that the Great American Novel had yet to be written. The essay&#x27;s publication coincided with the rising prestige of the novel. Previously, only five percent of American books were marked as novels, with most fictional works given the self-effacing title of a &quot;tale&quot;. In 1880, writer Henry James simplified the term with the initialism &quot;GAN&quot;.

=== Development ===
The term soon became popular, its ubiquity considered a cliché and disparaged by literary critics. Lawrence Buell stated that the concept was seen as a part of a larger national, cultural and political consolidation. According to &quot;JSTOR Daily&quot;&#x27;s Grant Shreve, as the concept grew, concrete criteria for the Great American Novel developed:
* It must encompass the entire nation and not be too consumed with a particular region.
* It must be democratic in spirit and form.
* Its author must have been born in the United States or have adopted the country as his or her own.
* Its true cultural worth must not be recognized upon its publication.
Additionally, Shreve states, referencing Buell, that &quot;several &#x27;templates&#x27; or &#x27;recipes&#x27; for the Great American Novel emerged... Recipe 1 is to write a novel that is &#x27;subjected to a series of memorable rewritings.&#x27;... Recipe 2 is what Buell calls &#x27;the romance of the divide.&#x27; Novels of this kind... imagine national (and geographic) rifts in the &#x27;form of a family history and/or heterosexual love affair.&#x27;... Recipe 3, a &#x27;narrative centering on the lifeline of a socially paradigmatic figure... whose odyssey tilts on the one side toward picaresque and on the other toward a saga of personal transformation, or failure of such.&#x27;&quot;

From the turn of the century to the mid-twentieth century, the idea eluded serious academic consideration, being dismissed as a &quot;naively amateurish age-of-realism pipe dream&quot; not aligned with the culture of that time. Writers such as William Dean Howells and Mark Twain were equally blasé. Frank Norris too saw the concept as not befitting the time, stating that the fact of a great work being American should be incidental. Edith Wharton complained that the Great American Novel concept held a narrow view of the nation, simply being concerned with &quot;Main Street&quot;. At this time, it also grew to become associated with masculine values.

Despite this critical disregard, many writers, prepped with &quot;templates&quot; and &quot;recipes&quot; for the matter, sought to create the next Great American Novel; Upton Sinclair and Sinclair Lewis both sought to create the Great American Novel with &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906) and &quot;Babbit&quot; (1924), respectively. William Carlos Williams and Clyde Brion Davis released satirical explorations both entitled &quot;The Great American Novel –&quot; Philip Roth would later release a novel of the same name&quot;.&quot; Bernard F. Jr. Rogers said that Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;entire career might be characterised as an attempt to produce something like &quot;the GAN&quot;, but of its own time&quot;. The 1970s saw a general resurgence of the concept, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; using the phrase the most in their history, a total of 71 times. The revival was perhaps the result of social change and related anxieties and the pursuit of a plateau between them.

In the 21st century, retaining its contention and derision, the concept has moved towards a more populist attitude, functioning as &quot;catnip for a listicle-obsessed internet&quot;. Adam Kirsch noted that books such as Roth&#x27;s &quot;American Pastoral&quot; (1997) indicate that writers are still interested in creating the Great American Novel. Commenting upon the Great American Novel&#x27;s place in the 21st century, Stephens Shapiro said that &quot;Maybe the GAN is a theme that rises in interest when the existing world system is amidst transformation, as America&#x27;s greatness of all kinds swiftly fades away.&quot; When asked in a 2004 interview if the Great American Novel could be written, Norman Mailer—who had long been interested in the idea—said it could not, for United States had become too developed of a nation. Tony Tulathimutte similarly dismissed it as &quot;a comforting romantic myth, which wrongly assumes that commonality is more significant than individuality&quot;.

==Analysis==

=== Racial and gender commentary ===
Multiple commentators have noted the concept&#x27;s relation to racial and national identity, be it influence from by large-scale immigration, which brought forth authors closely aligned with the Great American Novel or novels detailing marginalized peoples, some furthermore trying to &quot;bridge the racial divide&quot;. Commenting upon the idea&#x27;s racial aspects and presence in popular conscious, Hugh Kenner wrote in a 1953 issue of &quot;Perspective&quot; that:

Perrin, Andrew Hoberek and Barbara Probst Solomon all noted that the 70s saw Jews pursue the GAN. Perrin said it was a boom decade for, what Hoberek, called the &quot;Jewish GAN&quot;. Solomon was by 1972 sick of &quot;nice Jewish sons who are writing the GAN&quot;. Aaron Latham, in a 1971 article, highlighted Roth and Mailer as Jews who wanted to the write the next GJN and GAN, respectively.

The Great American Novel&#x27;s relation to masculinity was seen as a problem by female writers. Gertrude Stein once lamented that, as a lesbian Jewish woman, she would be unable to compose the Great American Novel. Joyce Carol Oates similarly felt that &quot;a woman could write it, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be the GAN&quot;. Viet Thanh Nguyen said that of the unspoken silences of the Great American Novel is the assumption that it can only be written by white men&quot;. Laura Miller wrote, in a &quot;Salon&quot; article, that &quot;The presumption and the belligerence embodied in this ideal have put off many American women writers&quot;. She also noted that many characters in Great American Novel candidates are male: &quot;the notion that a female figure might serve the same purpose undermines the very concept of the Great American Novel&quot;. Although British analyst Faye Hammill noted that &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; by Anita Loos, was one of the few that &#x27;doesn&#x27;t stink&#x27;. Emily Temple of Literary Hub suggested that if the protagonist of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (1963) were male it would likely be considered more seriously as a Great American Novel contender.

=== Interpretations ===
There are several different interpretations of what makes a Great American Novel. Some say that it depicts a diverse group facing issues representative of &quot;epoch-defining public events or crises.&quot; John Scalzi felt that for a novel to be the Great American Novel it had to be ubiquitous and notable, and analyze United States through a moral context. De Forest, similarly saw the Great American Novel as having to capture the &quot;essence&quot; of America, its quality irrelevant. Norris considered the musings upon what made a novel &quot;great&quot; and/or &quot;American&quot; to showcase patriotic insecurity. Mohsin Hamid echoed the idea that the GAN is indicative of insecurity, connecting it to a &quot;colonial legacy&quot;.

Commentators have said that the concept is exclusively American in nature. Journalist John Walsh offered a national equal in the form of Russian writer Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1869); Buell felt that Australia was the only country to replicate America&#x27;s search. Scholes said that the Great American Novel has always been thought of adjacent to European literature. David Vann was of the belief that they had to be &quot;anti-American&quot;. Rogers felt that it does not need to have American protagonists or be set in United States and should not espouse patriotism or nationalism.

Buell identifies multiple types of Great American Novels. First is one who is subject to mysticism and stands the test of time. The second is &quot;the romance of the divide&quot;, which imagines national rifts in the &quot;form of a family history and/or heterosexual love affair&quot;—race often plays a role. The third variety encapsulates the American Dream and see its protagonist rise from obscurity. Fourthly, novels which are composed of a diverse cast of characters &quot;imagined as social microcosms or vanguards&quot; and who are placed with events and crises that serve to &quot;constitute an image of &#x27;democratic&#x27; promise or dysfunction&quot;. Buell also said speculative science fiction may be the basis for a possible fifth archetype.

Kasia Boddy wrote that, its initial formulation&quot;, the concept &quot;has always been more about inspiration than achievement; the very fact that it has been attempted but remains &#x27;unwritten&#x27; providing a spur to future engagement with both nation and national literature&quot;. Speculating on De Forest&#x27;s intentions when devising the notion of the Great American Novel and commenting upon its development, Cheryl Strayed wrote that:

Denoting an apocryphal state, film critic A. O. Scott compared the GAN to the Yeti, the Loch Ness monster and the Sasquatch.

<doc id="964621" wikidata="Q3472740" url="?curid=964621" title="Santa Rosa Island, Florida">
<text>Santa Rosa Island is a 40-mile (64 km) barrier island located in the U.S. state of Florida, thirty miles (50 km) east of the Alabama state border. The communities of Pensacola Beach, Navarre Beach, and Okaloosa Island are located on the island. On the northern side of the island, are Pensacola Bay on the west (&quot;see map&quot;) and Choctawhatchee Bay on the east, joined through Santa Rosa Sound.

Santa Rosa Island has weathered numerous hurricanes and other tropical cyclones, including the hurricane of September 1559, Hurricane Erin and Hurricane Opal (both in 1995), Hurricane Ivan (2004), Hurricane Dennis (2005), Tropical Storm Claudette (2009), and the remnants of Hurricane Ida (2009).

Parts of the island are protected from development within the Gulf Islands National Seashore.

== History ==
===Pre-statehood===
Santa Rosa Island was explored by Spanish Conquistadors circa 1519. Years later, an expedition led by Tristan de Luna arrived from Vera Cruz (of New Spain) in August 1559 to found a settlement. Spanish settlements in the area were abandoned in 1561, following damage from storms, lack of supplies resulting in famine, and conflicts with the Pensacola natives.

After a treaty in 1722 returned Pensacola from French hands back to Spanish, the island was settled by Spain on November 25, 1722. The colony, Presidio Isla de Santa Rosa, was hit by hurricanes in 1741 and 1752 forcing the settlers to relocate across the bay to what is now Pensacola. The remaining remnants on the island were wiped out by a 1762 hurricane.

Following the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, Santa Rosa Island was inhabited by Creeks. During a visit in 1835, the famous painter George Catlin painted a Creek family catching and drying redfish on the island. 

===American Civil War===
After the outbreak of the American Civil War, some of the Union troops located within Confederate Florida retreated to Fort Pickens on the island.

The Battle of Santa Rosa Island took place here on October 9, 1861. Confederate Richard Anderson crossed from the Florida mainland onto Santa Rosa Island with 1200 men, in two small steamers, in a failed attempt to capture Fort Pickens (located on the west end of the island). In late 1863, the Union formed a recruiting post at the far east end of the island. By 1864, the garrison was reinforced by a large number of deserters and others who were pro-Union. The sheriff and some of the prominent citizens of the town served as guides and supplied the Union force with horses for raiding. The fort remained in Federal hands throughout the war.

===20th century===
Considering Fort Pickens to be outdated, the U.S. War Department sold Santa Rosa Island in 1929 to Escambia County, Florida, for US$10,000. Ten years later, the county returned the island to the federal government in the expectation that it would be developed as a U.S. national monument preserving the remnants of Fort Pickens; President Roosevelt created Santa Rosa Island National Monument in 1939 but it was abolished seven years later. The fort and other areas are now preserved within the Gulf Islands National Seashore, created in 1971.

On July 8, 1950 the federal government conveyed an parcel of Santa Rosa Island with of Gulf frontage to Okaloosa County. The county paid the federal government $4,000 to complete the transaction, which was supported by Congressman Bob Sikes. The portion of Santa Rosa Island transferred is now known as Okaloosa Island. The twelve-mile (19 km) long beach road onto U.S. Air Force property, west of the Okaloosa Island portion of Santa Rosa Boulevard, was unguarded and accessible into the 1990s, but heightened security concerns have since led to it being guarded or blocked at all times. Various military missile launch and test facilities exist on Santa Rosa Island south and southwest of Hurlburt Field.

The island has been hit by many tropical cyclones; in 1995 it was the landfall point of hurricanes Erin and Opal. Hurricane Dennis hit the island in July 2005, and with winds, was the strongest storm to do so. Tropical Storm Claudette hit in 2009.

In 2008-2009, a sunken Spanish ship was located and excavated offshore. These findings confirmed reports of the 1559 expedition by Tristan de Luna, which had established a settlement at Pensacola. 

One of the final missions in the Florida Phase of the US Army&#x27;s Ranger School is conducted on Santa Rosa Island.

<text>Devils Lake is a small lake in Lincoln County, Oregon, United States, along the Oregon Coast. It separates the northern part of Lincoln City from the Central Oregon Coast Range. It is 1/3 of a mile wide, three miles (5 km) long, and up to deep. The D River flows from the lake westward to the Pacific Ocean. At , it once contested with the Roe River in Montana for the title of the &quot;World&#x27;s Shortest River&quot;, until in 2006 the heated debates and technicalities caused the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; to no longer recognize the accolade.

According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, the name derives from a Native American legend. In the legend, a giant fish, giant octopus, or other large marine creature would occasionally surface, much to the dismay of anyone fishing in the vicinity.

The lake is managed by the Devils Lake Water Improvement District. The Preservation Association of Devils Lake (PADL) was founded in 1982. According to the organization&#x27;s website, its mission is:

To correct, protect and preserve the water resources and other natural assets of Devils Lake from misuse and pollution. To encourage the improvement of the overall environmental and economic use of the lake as a recreational, scenic asset for all time to the entire Lincoln City area.

<doc id="964630" wikidata="Q5008897" url="?curid=964630" title="CATH database">
<text>The CATH Protein Structure Classification database is a free, publicly available online resource that provides information on the evolutionary relationships of protein domains. It was created in the mid-1990s by Professor Christine Orengo and colleagues including Janet Thornton and David Jones, and continues to be developed by the Orengo group at University College London. CATH shares many broad features with the SCOP resource, however there are also many areas in which the detailed classification differs greatly.

==Hierarchical organization==
Experimentally determined protein three-dimensional structures are obtained from the Protein Data Bank and split into their consecutive polypeptide chains, where applicable. Protein domains are identified within these chains using a mixture of automatic methods and manual curation.

The domains are then classified within the CATH structural hierarchy: at the Class (C) level, domains are assigned according to their secondary structure content, i.e. all alpha, all beta, a mixture of alpha and beta, or little secondary structure; at the Architecture (A) level, information on the secondary structure arrangement in three-dimensional space is used for assignment; at the Topology/fold (T) level, information on how the secondary structure elements are connected and arranged is used; assignments are made to the Homologous superfamily (H) level if there is good evidence that the domains are related by evolution i.e. they are homologous.

Additional sequence data for domains with no experimentally determined structures are provided by CATH&#x27;s sister resource, Gene3D, which are used to populate the homologous superfamilies. Protein sequences from UniProtKB and Ensembl are scanned against CATH HMMs to predict domain sequence boundaries and make homologous superfamily assignments.

==Releases==
The CATH team releases new data both as daily snapshots, and official releases approximately annually. The latest release of CATH-Gene3D (v4.3) was released in December 2020 and consists of:
* 500,238 structural protein domain entries
* 151 mln non-structural protein domain entries
* 5,481 homologous superfamily entries
* 212,872 functional family entries

==Open-source software==
CATH is an open source software project, with developers developing and maintaining a number of open-source tools, which are available publicly on GitHub.

<doc id="964631" wikidata="Q5306461" url="?curid=964631" title="Dream Team (TV series)">
<text>Dream Team is a British sports drama television series produced by Hewland International which aired on Sky One from 1997 to 2007; it chronicled the on-field and off-field affairs of the fictional Premier League football club Harchester United. Originally broadcast in a soap opera format with two twice-weekly episodes (typically Tuesday and Thursday evenings) broadcast in the half-hour format. This continued for the first three seasons and 200 episodes, from which the show was reformatted into a prime-time one-hour drama weekly on Sunday nights where it remained for its next seven seasons until its final 419th episode.

The show&#x27;s cast varied over the years with many comings and goings that reflect the natural course of a professional football club throughout various seasons. Lisa Burstow, Terry Kiely, Alison King, Danny Husbands, Andy Ansah, Emma Gilmour, Daymon Britton, John Salthouse, Philip Barantini and Francis Johnson were the most frequently cast members over the 10 seasons. Notable other actors included Martin Crewes, Ricky Whittle, Charles Venn, Michael Melia, Luke Mably, Dhaffer L&#x27;Abidine, Jamie Lomas, Robert Kazinsky, Kara Tointon and Robbie Gee. Many real life footballers and members of English sporting community including presenters and commentators also featured on the show.

==Premise==
The show began in 1997 and centered on the Harchester United youth team. The next series, series 2 transmitted in 1998 concluding in 1999 focused on the first team for the first time and on Ian Coates, the manager, Jerry and Lynda Block, the owners of Harchester United and Luis Amor Rodriguez, star striker and soon-to-be lover of Lynda. The end of the series resulted in Harchester winning the FA Cup.

Series 3, that followed focused on the club fighting against relegation, qualifying for the highly acclaimed Champions League and being demoted to the Football League for financial irregularities and corruption after they were found guilty of match fixing.

As the show developed, the storylines became more and more extravagant, with the character death toll rising significantly in later series. Some of the most outlandish storylines included a striker being shot by a sniper after winning the FA Cup, a fan being brought onto the pitch to play during a game, and later becoming a Premier League star, and a goalkeeper in gambling debt holding the entire team hostage before being killed by a SWAT team. With declining viewing figures and repetitive storylines, Sky decided not to renew the Dream Team contract, and in April 2006, the director of programmes at Sky One, Richard Woolfe, confirmed the show would not return after the tenth 
series.

The tenth series began on 29 October 2006, the final episode being broadcast on 3 June 2007, with viewers left unaware of which characters survived a massive fire that ripped through the Dragon&#x27;s Lair during the final Premier League game of the season. However it is hinted that Harchester United win the Premier League thanks to a last minute goal from Jason Porter. The last ever song to be played on the programme was &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; by Oasis.

The main storyline of series ten revolved around &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, a mysterious poster on the club&#x27;s fansite revealing the innermost secrets of the club. It was ultimately this storyline that resulted in the arson attack that ended the series. Following the announcement of &quot;Dream Team&quot; being axed, many of the main cast members left the programme at the start of series ten. These included Alex Dempsey, Lynda Block and Ryan Naysmith.

==Harchester United==
Harchester United was the fictional Premier League football club featured in the series, known by their nickname &quot;The Dragons&quot; and club motto &#x27;Contende Ad Caelum&#x27; meaning Strive for the Skies and/or Be The Best. Its geographical location was north of Birmingham and Coventry, and two miles east of Tamworth, a Midlands setting chosen so as not to alienate football fans from either the North or South. Its filming locations however, started with Watford&#x27;s Vicarage Road doubling as Addison Road for the show&#x27;s first two seasons (1997–99) with a move to a new stadium, The Dragons&#x27; Lair seeing Milwall&#x27;s The New Den becoming The Dragons&#x27; home for the next eight seasons.

==Production==

The shows&#x27;s production overseen by Hewland International and aired on the Sky One channel between 1997 and 2007. It was one of the earliest examples of &#x27;subscription&#x27; television drama, arriving at a time when Sky television was the leading source in the genre. 

A unique identity to hold, Dream Team wasn&#x27;t the first UK-made drama to crack this particular market, that accolade belonging to Galaxy&#x27;s soap &quot;Jupiter Moon&quot; in 1990, a show only curtailed by the merger of the channel&#x27;s owner, British Satellite Broadcasting, with rivals Sky Television, shuttering virtually all of BSB&#x27;s output in favour of Sky&#x27;s. Seven years later, Dream Team began airing on Sky One in the soap opera format, with two twice-weekly episodes (typically Tuesday and Thursday evenings) broadcast in the half-hour format. This continued for the first three seasons and 200 episodes, from which the show was reformatted into a prime-time one-hour drama weekly on Sunday nights where it remained for its next seven seasons until its final 419th episode.

The &quot;Dream Team&quot; series used a technique called rotoscoping to create the live action football sequences, that would put players from the clubs competing against real-life players and teams from the Premier League, EFL Championship, and internationally in the UEFA Cup, and Champions League.

Harchester United team kits were created by real kit manufacturers and were also available to buy whilst the show was on the air. These kits were made by PONY for series one (1997–1998), Le Coq Sportif for series two to seven (1998–2003), and later Valsport for series eight to ten (2004–2007).

It has been theorised that the third kit worn by Everton players during the 2014–15 season were inspired by those donned by Harchester United.

==Episodes==
419 episodes were made over ten series. For the first three series, the show aired in a half-hour format of Tuesday and Thursday nights, with an hour-long omnibus airing on Saturday/Sunday mornings. The final episodes for series two and three were both an hour in duration and after receiving strong ratings in both cases, starting in series four, the show switched to a single hour-long episode on Sunday evenings.

==Foreign audience==
In the United States, Fox Soccer Channel (like Sky, a part of News Corporation) aired &quot;Dream Team&quot; as part of their schedule outside of prime periods. The series also aired in India on STAR Sports, in Ukraine on ICTV, in Serbia on Studio B television, in France on france 4, in Montenegro on TV In, in Estonia on TV4, in Bosnia and Herzegovina on BHT1 and in North Macedonia on MRT 1. It also aired on Botswana&#x27;s national television station Btv, in Kenya on STV, and in South Africa on SABC 1.

<text>The Offshore Industry Liaison Committee (OILC) was a trade union set up in the United Kingdom in response to the deaths of 167 workers on the Piper Alpha platform on 6 July 1988. The death of another worker on the Ocean Odyssey oil rig on 22 September 1988 and other accidents also played a part in spurring its foundation. The union, still in the form of an unofficial committee drawn from different North Sea rigs, organized large strikes in the summers of 1989 and 1990.

The OILC is now a branch of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), having agreed to merge from April 2008.

<text>Litvaks () or Lita&#x27;im () are Jews with roots in the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania (covering present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, the northeastern Suwałki and Białystok regions of Poland, as well as adjacent areas of modern-day Russia and Ukraine). Over 90% of the population was killed during the Holocaust. The term is sometimes used to cover all Haredi Jews who follow an Ashkenazi, non-Hasidic style of life and learning, whatever their ethnic background. The area where Litvaks lived is referred to in Yiddish as , hence the Hebrew term ().

No other Jew is more closely linked to a specifically Lithuanian city than the Vilna Gaon (in Yiddish, &quot;the genius of Vilna&quot;), Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon Zalman (1720–1797). He helped make Vilna (modern-day Vilnius) a world center for Talmudic learning. Chaim Grade (1910–1982) was born in Vilna, the city about which he would write.

The inter-war Republic of Lithuania was home to a large and influential Jewish community whose members either fled the country or were murdered when the Holocaust in Lithuania began in 1941. Prior to World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population comprised some 160,000 people, or about 7% of the total population. There were over 110 synagogues and 10 yeshivas in Vilnius alone. Census figures from 2005 recorded 4,007 Jews in Lithuania – 0.12 percent of the country&#x27;s total population.

Vilna (Vilnius) was occupied by Nazi Germany in June 1941. Within a matter of months, this famous Jewish community had been devastated with over two-thirds of its population killed.

Based on data by Institute of Jewish Policy Research, as of 1 January 2016, the core Jewish population of Lithuania is estimated to be 2,700 (0.09% of the wider population), and the enlarged Jewish population was estimated at 6,500 (0.23% of the wider population). The Lithuanian Jewish population is concentrated in the capital, Vilnius, with smaller population centres including Klaipėda and Kaunas.

==Etymology==

The Yiddish adjective means &quot;Lithuanian&quot;: the noun for a Lithuanian Jew is . The term itself originates from , a Polish term denoting &quot;a man from Lithuania&quot;, which however went out of use before the 19th century, having been supplanted in this meaning by , only to be revived around 1880 in the narrower meaning of &quot;a Lithuanian Jew&quot;. The &quot;Lithuania&quot; meant here is the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Of the main Yiddish dialects in Europe, the Litvishe Yiddish (Lithuanian Yiddish) dialect was spoken by Jews in Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia and northeastern Poland, including Suwałki, Łomża, and Białystok.

However, following the dispute between the Hasidim and the Misnagdim, in which the Lithuanian academies were the heartland of opposition to Hasidism, &quot;Lithuanian&quot; came to have the connotation of Misnagdic (non-Hasidic) Judaism generally, and to be used for all Jews who follow the traditions of the great Lithuanian yeshivot, whether or not their ancestors actually came from Lithuania. In modern Israel, (Lithuanians) is often used for all Haredi Jews who are not Hasidim (and not Hardalim or Sephardic Haredim). Other expressions used for this purpose are and . Both the words and are somewhat misleading, because there are also Hasidic Jews from greater Lithuania and many Litvaks who are not Haredim. The term (&quot;opponents&quot;) on the other hand is somewhat outdated, because the opposition between the two groups has lost much of its relevance. is also problematic because Hasidim now make use of yeshivot as much as the Litvishe Jews.

==Ethnicity, religious customs and heritage==
The characteristically &quot;Lithuanian&quot; approach to Judaism was marked by a concentration on highly intellectual Talmud study. Lithuania became the heartland of the traditionalist opposition to Hasidism. They named themselves &quot;misnagdim&quot; (opposers) of the Hasidi. The Lithuanian traditionalists believed Hassidim represented a threat to Halachic observance due to certain Kabbalistic beliefs held by the Hassidim, that, if misinterpreted, could lead one to heresy as per the Frankists. Differences between the groups grew to the extent that in popular perception &quot;Lithuanian&quot; and &quot;misnagged&quot; became virtually interchangeable terms. However, a sizable minority of Litvaks belong(ed) to Hasidic groups, including Chabad, Slonim, Karlin-Stolin, Karlin (Pinsk), Lechovitch, Amdur and Koidanov. With the spread of the Enlightenment, many Litvaks became devotees of the &quot;Haskala&quot; (Jewish Enlightenment) movement in Eastern Europe pressing for better integration into European society, and today, many leading academics, scientists, and philosophers are of Lithuanian Jewish descent.

The most famous Lithuanian institution of Jewish learning was Volozhin yeshiva, which was the model for most later yeshivas. Twentieth century &quot;Lithuanian&quot; yeshivas include Ponevezh, Telshe, Mir, Kelm, and Slabodka, which bear the names of their Lithuanian forebears. American &quot;offspring&quot; of the Lithuanian yeshiva movement include Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen (&quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;), and Beth Medrash Govoha (&quot;Lakewood&quot;), as well as numerous other yeshivas founded by students of Lakewood&#x27;s founder, Rabbi Aharon Kotler.

In theoretical Talmud study, the leading Lithuanian authorities were Chaim Soloveitchik and the Brisker school; rival approaches were those of the Mir and Telshe yeshivas. In practical halakha, the Lithuanians traditionally followed the Aruch HaShulchan, though today, the &quot;Lithuanian&quot; yeshivas prefer the Mishnah Berurah, which is regarded as both more analytic and more accessible.

In the 19th century, the Orthodox Ashkenazi residents of the Holy Land, broadly speaking, were divided into Hasidim and Perushim, who were Litvaks influenced by the Vilna Gaon. For this reason, in modern-day Israeli Haredi parlance the terms &quot;Litvak&quot; (noun) or &quot;Litvisher&quot; (adjective), or in Hebrew &quot;Litaim&quot;, are often used loosely to include any non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredi individual or institution. Another reason for this broadening of the term is the fact that many of the leading Israeli Haredi yeshivas (outside the Hasidic camp) are successor bodies to the famous yeshivot of Lithuania, though their present-day members may or may not be descended from Lithuanian Jewry. In reality, both the ethnic make-up and the religious traditions of the misnagged communities are much more diverse.
Customs of Lithuanian non-Hasidic Jews consist of:
# Wearing of tefillin during non-sabbath days of the intermediate days of the festival chol hamoed.
# Variations in pronunciation (not practiced by most modern-day Litvaks)
#*The pronunciation of the holam as /ej/ (&quot;ei&quot;).
#* The &quot;shin&quot; being pronounced as /s/, making it difficult to differentiate from &quot;sin&quot;, a phenomenon known as (&#x27;Sabbath Lingo&#x27;).

==History==

Jews began living in Lithuania as early as the 13th century. In 1388, they were granted a charter by Vytautas, under which they formed a class of freemen subject in all criminal cases directly to the jurisdiction of the grand duke and his official representatives, and in petty suits to the jurisdiction of local officials on an equal footing with the lesser nobles (&quot;szlachta&quot;), boyars, and other free citizens. As a result, the community prospered.

In 1495, they were expelled by Alexander Jagiellon, but allowed to return in 1503. The Lithuanian statute of 1566 placed a number of restrictions on the Jews, and imposed sumptuary laws, including the requirement that they wear distinctive clothing, including yellow caps for men and yellow kerchiefs for women.

The Khmelnytsky Uprising destroyed the existing Lithuanian Jewish institutions. Still, the Jewish population of Lithuania grew from an estimated 120,000 in 1569 to approximately 250,000 in 1792. After the 1793 Second Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Litvaks became subjects of the Russian Empire.

===Litvaks in the Second World War===
 The Jewish Lithuanian population before World War II numbered around 160,000, or about 7% of the total population. At the beginning of the war, some 12,000 Jewish refugees fled into Lithuania from Poland; by 1941 the Jewish population of Lithuania had increased to approximately 250,000, or 10% of the total population.

During the German invasion of June 1941, 141,000 Jews were murdered by the Nazis and Lithuanian collaborators. Notable execution locations were the Paneriai woods (see Ponary massacre) and the Ninth Fort.

==Culture==
Litvaks have an identifiable mode of pronouncing Hebrew and Yiddish; this is often used to determine the boundaries of Lita (area of settlement of Litvaks). Its most characteristic feature is the pronunciation of the vowel holam as (as against Sephardic , Germanic and Polish ).

In the popular perception, Litvaks were considered to be more intellectual and stoic than their rivals, the Galitzianers, who thought of them as cold fish. They, in turn, disdained Galitzianers as irrational and uneducated. Ira Steingroot&#x27;s &quot;Yiddish Knowledge Cards&quot; devote a card to this &quot;Ashkenazi version of the Hatfields and McCoys&quot;. This difference is of course connected with the Hasidic/misnaged debate, Hasidism being considered the more emotional and spontaneous form of religious expression. The two groups differed not only in their attitudes and their pronunciation, but also in their cuisine. The Galitzianers were known for rich, heavily sweetened dishes in contrast to the plainer, more savory Litvisher versions, with the boundary known as the Gefilte Fish Line.

==Genetics==

The Lithuanian Jewish population may exhibit a genetic founder effect. The utility of these variations has been the subject of debate. One variation, which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century, corresponding to the establishment of settlements in response to the invitation extended by Gediminas in 1323, which encouraged German Jews to settle in the newly established city of Vilnius. A relatively high rate of early-onset dystonia in the population has also been identified as possibly stemming from the founder effect.
