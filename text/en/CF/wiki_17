<text>Hawkmistress! is a science fantasy novel by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley, part of the &quot;Darkover&quot; series at the end of Ages of Chaos, in the period of Darkover&#x27;s history known as the Hundred Kingdoms. Chapters 35 and 46–50 of &quot;Zandru&#x27;s Forge&quot; overlap with the story in &quot;Hawkmistress!&quot;.

In &quot;Hawkmistress!&quot;, Bradley explores issues regarding the right to self-determination of minors, the place of women in a traditional society, and the conflicts between Darkover&#x27;s two major religious belief systems. She also continues the theme of Darkover society&#x27;s developing acceptance of homosexuality, through the character of Orain.

==Plot summary==
Romilly MacAran has the &quot;laran&quot; gift of her family – the ability to merge with the minds of animals. She uses this gift to train hawks and horses. When she reaches the age of fifteen (womanhood, in Darkover&#x27;s terms), her father refuses to allow her to continue working with animals on the grounds that it isn&#x27;t ladylike. He gives her prized hawk, Preciosa, to her brother, who has no gift. He also refuses her requests for an education.

When Romilly learns that her father intends to marry her off to a three-times widower, Garris of Scathfell, she realizes that leaving home is her only option. Dressed as a boy, she escapes with a horse from the stables.

Calling herself Rumal, she heads towards Nevarsin. Her hawk, Preciosa, appears in the sky, and provides her with a freshly killed bird, the first meal she has had in several days. Her fire attracts a company of men, headed by Dom Carlo and Dom Orain, who have three sick sentry birds that need care. They, too, are headed to Nevarsin, and Romilly takes over the care of their birds. Romilly reveals that she is a &quot;cristoforo&quot;. Dom Carlo claims to be a kinsman of the deposed king, Carolin, and is fleeing his cousin, Rakhal, who has taken the throne by force.

At Nevarsin, the company enters the &quot;cristoforo&quot; monastery of St. Valentine of the Snows. Romilly discovers that Caryl, the son of Lyondri Hastur, one of Dom Carlo&#x27;s bitterest enemies, is a student at the monastery. Romilly warns Orain.

Orain and Carlo believe themselves betrayed, and leave the monastery, taking Caryl Hastur as a hostage. Caryl is put in Romilly&#x27;s care.

At an inn in Caer Donn, Orain makes a pass at Romilly, believing her to be a boy, and is shocked to discover that she is a girl. He takes her to the hostel of the Sisterhood of the Sword where his cousin, Jandria, lives. He also asks Jandria to take charge of Caryl Hastur. Romilly becomes a member of the Sisterhood. A contingent of the Sisterhood join Carolin&#x27;s forces. Romilly&#x27;s hawk, Preciosa, reappears.

At Jandria&#x27;s request, Romilly accompanies Caryl back to his father in Hali city. Romilly returns to Jandria with medical supplies. At Serrais, Romilly is assigned to train horses, among them a black stallion whom she names Sunstar. She and Jandria deliver the horses to Carolin&#x27;s camp, where her brother, Ruyven, is also engaged caring for the sentry birds. At that time, Romilly discovers that &quot;Dom Carlo&quot; is actually King Carolin Hastur.

Several days later, the two armies engage in battle. Carolin learns that Lyondri is holding Orain and threatening to kill him. Romilly sneaks into the city, and is able to find Orain&#x27;s location. She meets Caryl, who out of disgust with his father&#x27;s torture of Orain, agrees to help free him. They return to Carolin&#x27;s camp.

Romilly decides that she must enter Tramontana tower for &quot;laran&quot; training.

<text>Maghemite (Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3) is a member of the family of iron oxides. It has the same formula as hematite, but the same spinel ferrite structure as magnetite () and is also ferrimagnetic. It is sometimes spelled as &quot;maghaemite&quot;.

&quot;Maghemite&quot; can be considered as an Fe(II)-deficient magnetite with formula
formula_1
 where
formula_2 represents a vacancy, A indicates tetrahedral and B octahedral positioning.

==Occurrence==
Maghemite forms by weathering or low-temperature oxidation of spinels containing iron(II) such as magnetite or titanomagnetite. Maghemite can also form through dehydration and transformation of certain iron oxyhydroxide minerals, such as lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite. It occurs as widespread brown or yellow pigment in terrestrial sediments and soils. It is associated with magnetite, ilmenite, anatase, pyrite, marcasite, lepidocrocite and goethite. It is known to also form in areas that have been subjected to bushfires (particularly in the Leonora area of Western Australia) magnetising iron minerals.

Maghemite was named in 1927 for an occurrence at the Iron Mountain Mine, northwest of Redding, Shasta County, California. The name alludes to somewhat intermediate character between magnetite and hematite. It can appear blue with a grey shade, white, or brown. It has isometric crystals. Maghemite is formed by the topotactic oxidation of magnetite.

==Cation distribution==
There is experimental and theoretical evidence that Fe(III) cations and vacancies tend to be ordered in the octahedral sites, in a way that maximizes the homogeneity of the distribution and therefore minimizes the electrostatic energy of the crystal.

==Electronic structure==
Maghemite is a semiconductor with a bandgap of ca. 2 eV, although the precise value of the gap depends on the electron spin.

==Applications==
Maghemite exhibits ferrimagnetic ordering with a high Néel temperature (~950 K), which together with its low cost and chemical stability led to its wide application as a magnetic pigment in electronic recording media since the 1940s.

Maghemite nanoparticles are used in biomedicine, because they are biocompatible and non-toxic to humans, while their magnetism allows remote manipulation with external fields.

==As pollutant==
It was found in 2022 that high levels of maghemite particles small enough to enter the bloodstream if inhaled, some as small as five nanometres, were present in the London Underground transport system. The presence of the particles indicated that they are suspended for long periods due to poor ventilation, particularly on platforms. The health implications presented by the particles were not investigated.

<doc id="944144" wikidata="Q1031955" url="?curid=944144" title="HAL HF-24 Marut">
<text>The HAL HF-24 Marut (&quot;Spirit of the Tempest&quot;) is an Indian jet fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) during the 1960s and early 70s. The Marut was designed by the German aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank, with the Project Engineer being George William Benjamin. The aircraft was the first Indian-developed jet fighter. On 17 June 1961, the type conducted its maiden flight; on 1 April 1967, the first production Marut was officially delivered to the IAF.

While the Marut had been envisioned as a supersonic-capable interceptor aircraft, it would never manage to exceed Mach 1. This limitation was principally due to the engines used, which in turn had been limited by various political and economic factors; multiple attempts to develop improved engines or to source alternative powerplants were fruitless.

The Marut&#x27;s cost and lack of capability in comparison to contemporary aircraft were often criticised. Nevertheless, the Marut performed relatively well in combat, primarily as a fighter-bomber in the ground attack role. Most notably participating in the Battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.

A total of 147 Maruts were manufactured, with the Indian Air Force (IAF) being the sole operator. By 1982, the Marut was becoming increasingly obsolescent, and was gradually phased out during the late 1980s.

==Design and development==

During the 1950s, Hindustan Aircraft Limited (HAL) had developed and produced several types of trainer aircraft, such as the HAL HT-2. However, elements within the firm were eager to expand into the then-new realm of supersonic fighter aircraft. Around the same time, the Indian government was in the process of formulating a new Air Staff Requirement for a Mach 2-capable combat aircraft to equip the Indian Air Force (IAF). However, as HAL lacked the necessary experience in both developing and manufacturing frontline combat fighters, it was clear that external guidance would be invaluable; this assistance was embodied by Kurt Tank.

In 1956, HAL formally began design work on the supersonic fighter project. The Indian government, led by Jawaharlal Nehru, authorised the development of the aircraft, stating that it would aid in the development of a modern aircraft industry in India. The first phase of the project sought to develop an airframe suitable for travelling at supersonic speeds, and able to effectively perform combat missions as a fighter aircraft, while the second phase sought to domestically design and produce an engine capable of propelling the aircraft. Early on, there was an explicit adherence to satisfying the IAF&#x27;s requirements for a capable fighter bomber; attributes such as a twin-engine configuration and a speed of Mach 1.4 to 1.5 were quickly emphasised.

During development, HAL designed and constructed a full-scale two-seat wooden glider to act as a flying demonstrator. Designated &quot;HAL X-241&quot;, this replicated production aircraft in terms of dimensions, control configuration, and aerofoil sections. The wheel brakes, air brakes, flaps, and retractable undercarriage were all actuated using compressed gas, with sufficient gas storage aboard for multiple actuations per flight. On 3 April 1959, the X-241 flew for the first time, after being towed into the air by a Douglas Dakota Mk.IV (&quot;BJ 449&quot;). A total of 86 flights were conducted prior to the X-241 sustaining considerable damage in a landing incident, when the nose undercarriage failed to extend.

On 24 June 1961, the prototype Marut conducted its first powered flight. It was fitted with the same UK-manufactured Bristol Siddeley Orpheus 703 turbojets that were installed in the Folland Gnat airframes that were already being manufactured, under license, by HAL. While the Marut had been designed around significantly more powerful engines, the un-reheated Orpheus 703 was a viable powerplant for testing purposes. This meant that the Marut was barely capable of Mach 1, even though a top speed of Mach 2 had originally been considered necessary. Before suitable, afterburning engines had been obtained, the Indian Government decided to order 16 pre-production and 60 production Maruts, powered by the Orpheus 703.

The IAF was reluctant to operate a fighter aircraft with performance that was, at best, marginally better than its existing fleet of British-built Hawker Hunters. Due to the insufficient power of the Orpheus 703, the Marut was technically obsolete by the time the first production aircraft were completed, in 1964.

On 1 April 1967, the first production Marut was officially accepted by the IAF. Only 147 aircraft, including 18 two-seat trainers, were completed out of a planned 214.

Following the first nuclear weapons tests by India, in 1974, adverse international public opinion worsened the chances of HAL obtaining better engines for the Marut; even spares for its existing Orpheus engines became scarce. This situation was one of the main reasons for the aircraft&#x27;s early demise.

===Termination and criticisms===
The Marut was described as &quot;essentially a very long-drawn-out failure&quot;, and the aircraft&#x27;s shortcomings were considered to be due to multiple factors. Among these were the difficulties experienced in securing a suitable engine, which was principally a political issue; while arrangements were successfully established with the United Kingdom and Bristol Siddeley for HAL to domestically produce the Orpheus, it was only suitable as an interim measure as it lacked the power to enable the Marut to achieve supersonic speed. The Indian Government refused a proposal made by Rolls-Royce to finance further development of the Orpheus, which had been specifically aimed at producing a more suitable engine for the Marut.

Other envisioned alternative engines that might have been sourced from the Soviet Union, Egypt, or various European nations did not result in anything of substance. The Gas Turbine Research Establishment also pursued their own development program to improve the Orpheus without external aid, which proceeded to the testing phase with some favourable results, but proved incompatible with the Marut. As the particularities of a given airframe are typically heavily dependent on the engine used, the inability to improve the Marut&#x27;s powerplant damaged its performance. Despite experimentation with various engines, the Marut was never able to achieve supersonic speeds, which was viewed as a major failure. IAF had anticipated the Marut being fitted with a considerably superior engine.

The project was negatively affected by a lack of direction and management from the Indian Ministry of Defence. A lack of coordination between the military, politicians, and industry is alleged to have been typical throughout the entirety of the programme, leaving many issues down to industry alone without guidance. Specifically, the government never sanctioned the development of an engine design team, nor were there assessments of HAL&#x27;s capability to reverse engineer or to apply technologies from other projects, such as the work performed for the Folland Gnat. HAL is claimed to have struggled to convince both the IAF and MoD that the design of the Marut was acceptable; much attention was given to the unacceptably high level of trail drag the airframe produced, as well as dissatisfaction with the Marut&#x27;s speed and manoeuvrability, both of which were below IAF specification upon the aircraft&#x27;s introduction.

Tank had a major influence on the project, and accordingly of its shortcomings. While working on the Marut, he was criticized for a rigid stance on aspects of the design, and he typically had little interest in lobbying the Indian government for funding to refine the design. In addition, however, elements of the IAF have been alleged to have held dismissive attitudes toward Tank and of his abilities, rarely coordinated with him on issues with the aircraft, which in turn exacerbated the type&#x27;s performance issues. The level of technological transfer between Germany and India on the project was subject to criticism as well.

Limitations within the Indian aerospace industry, which lacked the infrastructure and scientific base to successfully produce an effective indigenous combat aircraft at that time, forced a heavy reliance on foreign technologies and imported components. HAL&#x27;s willingness to undertake overly-ambitious defence projects may also be partially responsible for the project&#x27;s outcome. The Marut was not only heavily dependent on foreign-sourced materials, but was more expensive to manufacture the type in India than to have imported completed aircraft. The level of indigenous components increased over time, reportedly reaching 70 per cent by December 1973. The allocation of scarce resources to reproducing components that could have been readily imported represented a high level of opportunity cost to India.

The IAF reportedly showed little confidence or interest in indigenous fighter technology, having openly expressed its preference for the French-built Dassault Ouragan as an alternative. By the time the Marut entered mass production, the IAF had already purchased foreign-built fighters such as the Hawker Hunter and Sukhoi Su-7. Following on from the Marut, HAL proceeded to produce larger quantities of both European and Soviet combat aircraft under license, such as the SEPECAT Jaguar, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, and Mikoyan MiG-27.

==Operational history==
The Marut was used in combat in a ground attack role, where its safety features such as manual controls whenever the hydraulic systems failed, and twin engines, increased survivability. According to aviation author Pushpindar Singh, the Marut had excellent low-level flying characteristics, but its maneuverability suffered due to the lack of engine power; maintenance issues also resulted in the type being problematic in service.

In 1967, a single Marut was used as a testbed for the Egyptian indigenously-developed Brandner E-300 engine. The Indian team was recalled in July 1969, while the Egypt-based Marut was abandoned.

Given the limited number of Marut units, most Marut squadrons were considerably over-strength for the duration of their lives. According to Brian de Magray, at peak strength No.10 Squadron had on charge 32 Maruts, although the squadron probably did not hold a unit-establishment of more than 16. The Marut squadrons participated in the 1971 war and none were lost in air-to-air combat, although three were lost to ground fire, and one was destroyed on the ground. Three Marut pilots were awarded the Vir Chakra commendation.

Maruts constantly found themselves under heavy and concentrated fire from the ground during their low-level attack missions. On at least three occasions, Maruts regained their base after one engine had been lost to ground fire. On one of these, a Marut returned to base without escort on one engine, from about inside hostile territory. On another occasion, a pilot flying his Marut through debris that erupted into the air as he strafed a convoy felt a heavy blow to the rear fuselage of the aircraft, the engine damage warning lights immediately illuminated, and one engine cut out. Fortunately, the Marut attained a safe and reasonable recovery speed on one engine. Consequently, the pilot had no difficulty in flying his crippled fighter back to base. Another safety factor was the automatic reversion to manual control in the event of a failure in the hydraulic flying control system, and there were several instances of Maruts being flown back from a sortie manually. The Marut had a good survivability record in enemy airspace.

In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, some Maruts and Hawker Hunter aircraft were used to give close support to an Indian border post in the decisive Battle of Longewala, on the morning of 5 December 1971. The aerial attack was credited with destroying a large number of tanks that had been deployed by Pakistani ground forces. More than 300 combat sorties were flown by the Maruts during a two-week period in the war.

According to Indian reports, one aerial kill was recorded as having been achieved by a Marut. On 7 December 1971, Squadron Leader KK Bakshi of No. 220 Squadron shot down a PAF F-86 Sabre (reportedly flown by Flying Officer Hamid Khwaja of No. 15 Squadron of the Pakistan Air Force), however according to Pakistani reports, the F-86F Sabre (Serial No. 4030) had suffered an Engine flameout while chasing an Indian Hawker Hunter over Khushalgarh.

By 1982, the IAF was proposing that the Marut fleet be phased out on the basis that the type was &quot;no longer operationally viable&quot;. Supporters such as Air Commodore Jasjit Singh pointed out that the type had performed well in the 1971 combat, and had enjoyed superior safety records to other IAF aircraft such as the Gnat. Some aircraft had less than 100 recorded flight hours when the retirement of the Marut was being mooted.

<doc id="944147" wikidata="Q3629888" url="?curid=944147" title="Balaji Baji Rao">
<text>Balaji Baji Rao (8 December 1720 – 23 June 1761), often referred to as Nana Saheb I, was the 8th Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy. He was appointed as Peshwa in 1740 upon the death of his father, the Peshwa Bajirao I.

During his tenure, the Chhatrapati (Maratha Emperor) was a mere figurehead. At the same time, the Maratha empire started transforming into a confederacy, in which individual chiefs—such as the Holkars, the Scindias and the Bhonsles of Nagpur kingdom—became more powerful. During Balaji Rao&#x27;s tenure, the Maratha territory reached its zenith. A large part of this expansion, however, was led by the individual chiefs of the Maratha Empire.

Balaji Bajirao&#x27;s administration worked with his cousin Sadashivrao Bhau, introducing new legislative and financial systems in the state. Under his leadership, the borders of the Maratha Empire expanded to Peshawar in present-day Pakistan, Srirangapatna in the South, and Medinipur in present-day West Bengal. Nanasaheb built canals, bridges, temples and lodges for travellers in the capital city of Pune and in other parts of the Maratha Empire. In his twenty-year reign as the Peshwa, Nanasaheb subdued three major powers under his tenure, viz. Mughals in the North, the Nizam in the South and the Bengal Sultanate. Along with that he also weakened the Afghan control over Punjab, stopped their repeated invasions on the imperial capital of Delhi, subdued the Rajputs and Rohillas and neutralized the state of Oudh.

== Early years and family==

Balaji Rao was born in the Bhat family, to Peshwa Baji Rao I, on 8 December 1720. After Bajirao&#x27;s death in April 1740, Chhatrapati Shahu appointed 19-year old Balaji as the Peshwa in August 1740, despite opposition from other chiefs such as Raghoji I Bhonsle. Radhabai, the Grandmother of Balaji bajirao came across Gopikabai, a noble girl aged 6, during her visit to the Raste family. She was impressed by Gopikabai&#x27;s Orthodox Hindu upbringings as she was well versed in priestly religious matters and the prevailing customs followed in priestly Brahmin families. Despite her young age, Radhabai proposed the marriage of Gopikabai to her Grandson Balaji Bajirao, who was 10 at the time. The two eventually got married on 11 January 1730.

The couple had three sons, Vishwasrao who died in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, Madhavrao who succeeded Nanasaheb as Peshwa and Narayanrao who succeeded Madhavrao in his late teens. Nanasaheb had an able brother called Raghunathrao whose ambitions to be the Peshwa became disastrous for the Maratha empire.

== Rivalry with Raghoji Bhonsle ==
In early years of Balaji Rao&#x27;s tenure, Raghoji I Bhonsle helped extend Maratha influence in South and East India. However, he was not on good terms with the Peshwa. Shortly before Balaji&#x27;s appointment as the Peshwa, Raghoji had led a Maratha force to South India. His mission was to help Pratap Singh of Thanjavur, a royal of the Bhonsle clan, against Dost Ali Khan. Raghoji killed Dost Ali in May 1740, and installed Dost Ali&#x27;s son Safdar Ali Khan as the Nawab of Arcot. He returned to Satara, and unsuccessfully lodged a protest against Balaji Rao&#x27;s appointment as the Peshwa. He then returned to South India, where he defeated Chanda Sahib in March 1741, before being forced to retreat by Chanda Sahib&#x27;s French allies from Pondicherry. After returning to Satara, Raghoji continued to oppose Balaji Rao.

In 1743, Raghoji Bhonsle attacked Alivardi Khan&#x27;s forces in Orissa. Khan paid 2,000,000 to Balaji Rao, who helped him expel Raghoji from Orissa in 1744. Raghoji then complained to Chhatrapati Shahu, and got himself appointed the in-charge of Marathas in Orissa, Bengal and Bihar. By 1752, Raghoji had taken over administration of Orissa, and also frequently raided Bengal and Bihar to collect &quot;chauth&quot;. The instability brought by him to Bengal later paved way for the rise of the East India Company there.

== Rebellion by Tarabai and Umabai ==

Tarabai, the senior widow of Rajaram Chhatrapati after being released by her stepson Sambhaji II of Kolhapur was given asylum by Chhatrapati Shahu, her nephew. In the 1740s, during the last years of Shahu&#x27;s life, Tarabai brought a child to him: Rajaram II. She presented the child as her grandson, and thus, a direct descendant of Shivaji. Shahu adopted the child, and after his death in 1749, Rajaram II succeeded him as the &quot;Chhatrapati&quot;. The next year, Peshwa Balaji Rao left to fight against the Nizam of Hyderabad. In his absence, Tarabai urged Rajaram II to remove him from the post of Peshwa. When Rajaram refused, she imprisoned him in a dungeon at Satara, on 24 November 1750. She claimed that he was an impostor, and that she had falsely presented him as her grandson. Tarabai was unsuccessful in getting support from other ministers and the would-be Nizam Salabat Jung. However, she managed to enlist the help of another noblewoman, Umabai Dabhade.

Umabai Dabhade was the matriarch of the Dabhade family, whose members held the title of &quot;Senapati&quot; (commander-in-chief) and controlled several territories in Gujarat. Her husband had been killed by the Mughals, and her eldest son had been killed by Balaji Rao&#x27;s father for a rebellion against Chhatrapati Shahu. However, Shahu had forgiven the Dabhades and allowed them to retain their jagirs and titles on the condition that they would remit half of the revenues collected from Gujarat to his treasury. Umabai&#x27;s minor son Yashwant Rao was made the titular &quot;Senapati&quot;, while she held the actual executive power in Maratha territories of Gujarat. The Dabhades never actually shared any revenues, but Shahu did not want to take any action against a grieving mother. However, after Shahu&#x27;s death Peshwa Balaji Rao faced an empty treasury and pressurized the Dabhades to share Gujarat revenues as per the agreement. Umabai personally met him in 1750 and argued that the agreement was void because the Dabhades had signed it under force. The Peshwa refused to entertain this argument.

Umabai dispatched 15,000 troops led by her lieutenant Damaji Rao Gaekwad in support of Tarabai&#x27;s rebellion. Gaekwad initially advanced towards Pune, prompting the Peshwa&#x27;s mother Kashibai and his grandmother Radhabai to flee from Pune to Sinhagad. While encamped at Pargaon near Pune, he received a letter from the Peshwa loyalist Mahadji Purandare, who denounced him as a traitor. Subsequently, Gaekwad changed course and started advancing towards Satara. Mahadji&#x27;s brother Trimbakrao Purandare led a 20,000-strong force against him. Gaekwad defeated him at Nimb, a small town north of Satara. He then marched to Satara, where he was received by Tarabai. However, Trimbakrao re-formed his army and on 15 March 1751, he attacked Gaekwad&#x27;s army, which was encamped on the banks of the Venna River. Gaekwad was defeated in this battle, and forced to retreat with heavy losses. Trimbakrao kept pursuing him and cornered his force near a gorge in the Krishna River valley.

Meanwhile, on hearing about the rebellion, Balaji Rao left the Mughal frontier, and quickly advanced towards Satara, covering 400 miles in 13 days. He reached Satara on 24 April, and stormed the Yavateshwar garrison, defeating Tarabai&#x27;s forces. He then joined Trimbakrao, who had been keeping a watch on Gaekwad&#x27;s army. Gaekwad was compelled to declare ceasefire and meet Balaji Rao to discuss the terms of a peace treaty. Balaji Rao demanded from him half of Gujarat&#x27;s territories in addition to a war indemnity of 2,500,000. Damaji refused to sign an agreement, stating that he was only a subordinate, and asked Balaji Rao to consult Umabai. On 30 April, Balaji Rao launched a surprise evening attack, and Damaji&#x27;s camp surrendered without resistance. Balaji Rao then surrounded the Satara fort, and asked Tarabai to release Chhatrapati Rajaram II, whose physical and mental condition had deteriorated considerably. Tarabai refused, and Balaji Rao left for Pune, since a siege of the well-provisioned and strong Satara fort would not be easy.

Later, a section of Tarabai&#x27;s troops in the Satara garrison rebelled against her. Although she crushed the mutiny, she realized that it would be difficult to continue the fight against Balaji Rao. She, therefore, agreed to a peace treaty. She met Balaji Rao in Pune, and accepted the superiority of the Peshwa&#x27;s office. She agreed to dismiss her lieutenant Baburao Jadhav, whom the Peshwa disliked. In return, the Peshwa forgave her. On 14 September 1752, the two took oaths at Khandoba temple in Jejuri, promising mutual peace. At this oath ceremony, Tarabai swore that Rajaram II was not her grandson, but an impostor from the Gondhali caste. Nevertheless, the Peshwa retained Rajaram II as the titular Chhatrapati and a powerless figurehead.

In May 1751, Balaji Rao had arrested Damaji Gaekwad and his relatives, and sent them to Pune. Sometime later, the Dabhades were also arrested, and deprived of their jagirs and titles. In Pune, Balaji Rao repeatedly pressurized Damaji to cede half of Gujarat on behalf of Yashwant Rao Dabhade. Damaji kept refusing, and on 19 July 1751, Balaji Rao placed him and his dewan Ramchandra Baswant in strict confinement. On 14 November, he sent them to captivity in Lohagad. A few weeks later, Ramchandra Baswant escaped to Gujarat. As a result, Balaji Rao ordered Damaji to be put in iron chains at Lohagad. He then sent a military expedition to Gujarat, under his brother Raghunath Rao. Raghunath Rao managed to recover revenues from Surat, but could not advance north of the Tapti River. Meanwhile, Balaji Rao received a setback when his general Shankarji Keshav Phadke was defeated at the siege of Parner. As a result, he decided to seek reconciliation with the Gaekwads. In March 1752, Damaji finally agreed to abandon Dabhades and join Balaji Rao. In return, he was made the Maratha chief of Gujarat, and Balaji Rao offered him assistance in expelling the Mughals from Gujarat. Gaekwad promised to pay an annual tribute of 525,000 to Peshwa in addition to a one-time payment of 1,500,000. He was also asked to maintain a cavalry of 20,000 horses in service of the Peshwa.

== Campaign against the Nizam ==

In 1751, Balaji Rao had invaded the territories of Nizam of Hyderabad Salabat Jung, who was supported by the French Governor-General of Pondicherry Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau. Due to Tarabai&#x27;s rebellion and the French-trained enemy troops, the Marathas had to retreat. In 1752, Balaji Rao launched a fresh attack against the Nizam. He also sought support of the English to counter the French, but the English refused to get involved in the conflict. The Marathas wanted Salabat Jung&#x27;s brother Ghazi ud-Din Khan to be appointed as the Nizam; as he had promised them a payment of 6,000,000 among other favours. However, Khan was poisoned to death by his step-mother. Ultimately, Balaji Rao and Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau concluded a peace treaty. Raghoji Bhonsle also agreed to peace on the condition that Nizam would grant him some jagirs in Berar.

== Relations with Rajputs ==

Balaji&#x27;s father Baji Rao aimed to establish a &quot;Hindu Padshahi&quot; (Hindu kingship) in India, and maintained good relations with the Hindu Rajputs. However, during Balaji Rao&#x27;s tenure, the Marathas alienated the Rajput rulers.

When Jai Singh II of Jaipur died in 1743, a war of succession broke out between his sons Ishwari Singh and Madho Singh. Madho was supported by Jagat Singh II of Mewar and Ummed Singh of Bundi. The Marathas, however, initially supported Ishwari, simply because he offered them more money. Later, Jagat Singh was able to enlist Malhar Rao Holkar on Madho&#x27;s side, while Jayappa Rao Scindia continued to support Ishwari. This episode not only spoiled the Maratha relations with the Rajputs, but also resulted in internal strife among the Marathas. Madho Singh later sought arbitration from Balaji Rao, who personally came to Jaipur and convinced Ishwari Singh to cede 4 mahals to Madho Singh. Ishwari Singh initially agreed, but refused to abide by his promise after Balaji returned to Pune. Malhar Rao Holkar then not only forcefully captured the &quot;mahal&quot;s for Madho, but also imposed a tribute on Ishwari Singh. In 1750, the Marathas declared a war on Ishwari Singh for his failure to pay the arrears. Ishwari Singh was desperate as he did not have sufficient money to pay off the Marathas, and he could not impose excessive taxes on his citizens. As a result, he committed suicide by consuming poison.

After Ishawari Singh&#x27;s death, Madho Singh became the ruler of Jaipur. However, he no longer trusted the Marathas, having seen their treatment of his elder brother. He participated in battles against the Marathas, until Safdar Jang intervened and convinced the Marathas to leave with an apology and some compensation. After Safdar Jang&#x27;s death, the Marathas again invaded the Rajput territories. This forced Madho Singh to seek help from Safdar Jang&#x27;s successor Shuja-ud-Daula as well as the Afghan king Ahmad Shah Durrani (Abdali).

In 1749, Abhai Singh of Jodhpur (Marwar) died, leading to a war of succession between Bakht Singh and Ram Singh. Ram Singh sought help from Jayappa Scindia. By the time Scindia marched to Jodhpur in September 1752, Bakhat Singh had died. He was succeeded by his son Bijay Singh, who sought help against the Marathas from the Mughals, the Rohillas and Madho Singh. With Madho Singh&#x27;s help, Maharaja Vijay Singh resisted the Marathas for a year, before he agreed to peace talks. During one such peace negotiation, Jayappa Rao Scindia was assassinated by emissaries of Vijay Singh of Marwar in July 1755. This led to further hostilities between the Marathas and the Rajputs until Dattaji Rao Scindia concluded a peace treaty in February 1756.

== Relations with the Jats ==

The Marathas-Jat relations also worsened during Balaji Rao&#x27;s reign. Balaji&#x27;s younger brother Raghunath Rao wanted a share of revenues from the prosperous Bharatpur State. Suraj Mal, the ruler of this state, had interfered in Jaipur politics in support of Ishwari Singh. This had antagonized Maratha chiefs like Malhar Rao Holkar, who had supported Madho. In 1754, the Mughal wazir Safdar Jang sought Suraj Mal&#x27;s help against the Mughal emperor. To counter him, the imperial loyalist Imad-ul-Mulk, sought Maratha help. Raghunath Rao used this opportunity and sent a force led by Malhar Rao Holkar to Bharatpur. Suraj Mal tried to avoid a war by offering him 4,000,000; but, Raghunath Rao was not satisfied with the offer. The Marathas besieged Bharatpur&#x27;s Kumher fort in early 1754 for around four months, before a peace treaty was concluded. The Marathas accepted an offer by Suraj Mal to pay 3,000,000 in three yearly installments.

== Relations with the Mughals ==

During Baji Rao&#x27;s tenure, the Mughals had nominally granted the Malwa to the Marathas, but the control was not actually passed to the Marathas. After becoming Peshwa, Balaji Rao approached the Mughal emperor through Jai Singh II, and managed to get appointed as the Deputy Governor of Malwa (with Ahmad Shah as the titular Governor). In return, he pledged faithfulness to the Mughal emperor. He also agreed to keep a force of 500 soldiers at the emperor&#x27;s court, in addition to providing a force of 4,000 soldiers on a need basis.

In 1748, Javed Khan, a rival of the Mughal wazir Safdar Jang invited the new Nizam of Hyderabad Nasir Jung, to join an alliance against the wazir. Safdar Jang requested Maratha support against Nasir Jung. Balaji Rao dispatched Scindia and Holkar chiefs to prevent Nasir Jung from reaching Delhi, and thus, saved Safdar Jang.

Starting in 1748, the Afghan king Ahmad Shah Durrani (Abdali) launched several invasions of India, forcing the Mughals to seek Maratha help. In 1752, the Rohillas of the Doab region rebelled against the Mughal emperor. They defeated Safdar Jang in a battle, and invited Durrani to invade India. Once again, Safdar Jang sought assistance from the Marathas, who helped him crush the rebellion. The Marathas and the Mughals signed an agreement in 1752. The Marathas agreed to help the Mughals defeat external aggressions as well as internal rebellions. The Mughals agreed to appoint Peshwa Balaji Rao as the Governor of Ajmer and Agra. The Marathas were also granted the right to collect &quot;chauth&quot; from Lahore, Multan, Sindh, and some districts of Hissar and Moradabad. However, the Mughal emperor had also ceded Lahore and Multan to Ahmad Shah Durrani in order to pacify him. In addition, he did not ratify the transfer of Rajput-ruled territories like Ajmer to the Marathas. This brought the Marathas in conflict with Durranis as well as Rajputs.

== Maratha Expansion into Bengal ==

From 1741 to 1751, the Marathas under Raghuji Bhonsle invaded Bengal six times. The first one in 1741, The second in 1742, as also the third in 1744 and the fourth in 1745 were led by Raghuji himself. The fifth in 1747 and the sixth in 1748 were undertaken by Janoji and Sabaji respectively. These invasions caused heavy destruction in the armies of the Nawab of Bengal. Nawab Alivardi Khan was successful in repelling only the first invasion in 1741. In 1743 two Maratha armies invaded - one belonged to Raghoji Bhonsle and the other of Balaji Rao. Alivardi Khan was obliged to pay him a subsidie, promising to pay him &quot;Chauth&quot; tax. The continuous conflict took a heavy toll on the population of Bengal. The Hindu Maratha warriors invaded and occupied western Bengal up to the Hooghly River.

During this period, warriors called as &quot;Bargis&quot;, perpetrated atrocities against the local population, against Hindu Bengalis Muslims and Biharis. As reported in Burdwan Kingdom&#x27;s and European sources, the Bargis are said to have plundered villages, and Jan Kersseboom, chief of the Dutch East India Company factory in Bengal, estimated that perhaps 400,000 civilians in Western Bengal and Bihar were dead owing to the invasion of Bargis. The resulting casualties of Bargi onslaught against in Bengal are considered to be among the deadliest massacres in Indian history. According to the 18th-century Bengali text &quot;Maharashtra Purana&quot; written by Gangaram:

In 1751, the Marathas signed a peace treaty with the Nawab of Bengal, according to which Mir Habib (a former courtier of Alivardi Khan, who had defected to the Marathas) was made provincial governor of Orissa under nominal control of the Nawab of Bengal. It made The Nawab of Bengal a tributary to the Marathas who agrees to pay Rs. 1.2 million annually as the &quot;chauth&quot; of Bengal and Bihar, and the Marathas agreed not to invade Bengal again. The Nawab of Bengal also paid Rs. 3.2 million to the Marathas, towards the arrears of &quot;chauth&quot; for the preceding years. The &quot;chauth&quot; was paid annually by the Nawab of Bengal up to 1758, until the East India Company took over.

== Conflict with the Durrani Empire==

After his initial invasions of India, Ahmed Shah Durrani appointed his son Timur Shah Durrani as the governor of Punjab and Kashmir. Balaji Rao then dispatched Raghunath Rao to check the advance of the Durranis. In 1758, Raghunath Rao conquered Lahore and Peshawar, and drove out Timur Shah Durrani. This was the high-water mark of Maratha expansion, where the boundaries of their empire extended north of the Sindhu river all the way down south to northern Kerala. The Marathas thus became the Durrani&#x27;s major rivals in the north-western part of the subcontinent. Meanwhile, the Marathas had reduced the Mughal emperor to a figurehead, and Balaji Rao talked of placing his son Vishwasrao on the Mughal throne. The Mughal loyalist Muslim intellectuals of Delhi were alarmed at these developments, and appealed Durrani to check the rising Maratha power.

Under these circumstances, Ahmad Shah Durrani launched a fresh invasion of India, reaching Lahore by the end of 1759. He gained allies in the Rohilla noble Najib-ud-Daula and the Nawab of Oudh Shuja-ud-Daula. Balaji Rao responded to the Durrani invasion by dispatching a large force commanded by Sadashiv Rao Bhau. This force was supplemented by the contingents of Holkar, Scindia, Gaikwad and Govind Pant Bundele. The Jat ruler Suraj Mal of Bharatpur also joined the Marathas, but later left the alliance due to a misunderstanding with Bhau.

Between 1759 and 1761, the Durranis and the Marathas fought each other in several skirmishes and small battles, with varying results. Due to the extended duration of the siege of the Maratha garrison at Panipat which Balaji&#x27;s reinforcements were supposed to break but never reached beyond the Narmada, the Durranis decisively defeated the famished and under-equipped Maratha army in the Third Battle of Panipat on 14 January 1761. According to Suresh k Sharma, &quot;It was Balaji Bajirao&#x27;s love of pleasure which was responsible for Panipat. He delayed at Paithan celebrating his second marriage until December 27th, when it was too late.&quot;

== Death ==

The defeat at Panipat resulted in heavy losses for the Marathas, and was a huge setback for Peshwa Balaji Rao. He received the news of the defeat of Panipat on 24 January 1761 at Bhilsa, while leading a reinforcement force. Besides several important generals, he had lost his own son Vishwasrao and cousin Sadashivrao Bhau in the Battle of Panipat. He fell in depression and died on 23 June 1761 at Parvati hill and was succeeded by his younger son Madhav Rao I.

<doc id="944158" wikidata="Q366509" url="?curid=944158" title="Ohthere of Hålogaland">
<text>Ohthere of Hålogaland () was a Viking Age Norwegian seafarer known only from an account of his travels that he gave to King Alfred (r. 871–99) of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex in about 890 AD. His account was incorporated into an Old English adaptation of a Latin historical book written early in the fifth century by Paulus Orosius, called &quot;Historiarum Adversum Paganos Libri VII&quot;, or &quot;Seven Books of History Against the Pagans&quot;. The Old English version of this book is believed to have been written in Wessex in King Alfred&#x27;s lifetime or soon after his death, and the earliest surviving copy is attributed to the same place and time.

In his account, Ohthere said that his home was in &quot;Halgoland&quot;, or Hålogaland, where he lived &quot;north-most of all Norwegians … [since] no-one [lived] to the north of him&quot;. Ohthere spoke of his travels north to the White Sea, and south to Denmark, describing both journeys in some detail. He also spoke of &quot;Sweoland&quot; (central Sweden), the Sami people (&quot;Finnas&quot;), and of two peoples called the &quot;Cwenas&quot;, living in &quot;Cwena land&quot; to the north of the Swedes, and the &quot;Beormas&quot;, whom he found living by the White Sea. Ohthere reported that the &quot;Beormas&quot; spoke a language related to that of the Sami.

Ohthere&#x27;s story is the earliest known written source for the term &quot;Denmark&quot; (&quot;dena mearc&quot;), and perhaps also for &quot;Norway&quot; (&quot;norðweg&quot;). Ohthere&#x27;s home may have been in the vicinity of Tromsø, in southern Troms county, northern Norway. Ohthere was involved in the fur trade.

==Sources==
Orosius&#x27; 5th-century &quot;Seven Books of History Against the Pagans&quot; was a popular work of history in the Middle Ages, with about 250 manuscript copies from that period surviving today. Late in the 9th century King Alfred of Wessex, or members of his court, appear to have seen it as a useful basis for a world-history written in their own language, and an Old English version may have been seen as complementary to Bede&#x27;s 8th-century &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which was begun in Alfred&#x27;s reign. The Old English version of Orosius is an adaptation rather than a direct translation, one of its features being the addition and correction of information concerning European geography. The addition of Ohthere&#x27;s account of his travels, and that of another traveller named Wulfstan, represents part of that process.

The authorship of the Old English Orosius is unknown. In the 12th century William of Malmesbury believed that it was the work of King Alfred himself, but scholarly scrutiny of the text since the mid-20th century, including by the historians Dorothy Whitelock and Janet Bately, has led to this view being refuted on lexical and syntactic grounds. Janet Bately believes that the Old English version of Orosius was created between 889 and 899, probably in the early 890s, but there is no way of knowing whether Ohthere&#x27;s account was previously in existence and incorporated from the outset, or if it was written down later and incorporated into a subsequent copy. The events that Ohthere described may have taken place at any time from the 870s to the late 890s, and Ohthere&#x27;s account is given in the form of a third-person report of what he said to King Alfred, rather than as reported speech, as exemplified by the opening sentence: &quot;Ohthere sæde his hlaforde Ælfrede kynincge þæt he ealra Norðmanna norðmest bude.&quot; (&quot;Ohthere told his lord Alfred king that he lived northmost of all Norwegians.&quot;) Dorothy Whitelock wrote that &quot;Ohthere&#x27;s account reads like a set of replies to questions put to him.&quot;

The Old English version of Orosius survives almost complete in two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. The earliest is known variously as the Tollemache, Helmingham or Lauderdale Orosius, and is kept at the British Library under the reference &quot;Additional 47967&quot;. This manuscript was written in Wessex between about 892 and 925, possibly at Winchester. The second manuscript dates from early in the 11th century, is of unknown English provenance, and is kept at the British Library under the reference &quot;Cotton Tiberius B. i&quot;. Both manuscripts are copies of a &quot;common ancestor&quot;.

==Biography==
Ohthere said that he lived furthest north of all Norwegians, and that his home was in &quot;Halgoland&quot;, in the north of Norway, by the sea. Halgoland is identified in modern historiography as Hålogaland, a historical region of northern Norway comparable in area to the modern region of Nord-Norge. While greater precision is impossible, suggested localities for Ohthere&#x27;s home include Senja, Kvaløya, and the areas surrounding the Malangen fjord, all near Tromsø. He claimed to be a leading man in his homeland, perhaps to be understood as a chieftain, and described himself as wealthy, owning 600 tame reindeer, of which six were &quot;decoys&quot; used for catching wild reindeer. Conversely, according to the report in the Old English Orosius, Ohthere &quot;had not more than twenty horned cattle, and twenty sheep, and twenty swine, and the little that he ploughed he ploughed with horses.&quot; But his main wealth was in tax paid by the &quot;Finnas&quot;, or Sami people, of whom the highest-born paid 15 marten skins, 5 reindeer skins, 1 bear skin, 10 ambers of feathers, 1 coat of bear skin or otter skin and two ship&#x27;s ropes, each 60 ells long, made of either whale skin or seal skin.

Another source of Ohthere&#x27;s wealth was the hunting of whales and walrus. He is reported as saying that his own land was best for whale-hunting, with walrus up to 7 ells long and whales mostly 50 ells long, and that with five men he had killed sixty of them in two days. While the killing of this number of whales in two days seems unlikely, historian Kjell-Olav Masdalen suggests that, rather than whales, Ohthere intended the number killed to refer to walrus; Janet Bately suggests that it might best be seen as an indication of how many whales could be caught in good conditions. Ropes of whale skin were of sufficient value to be included in the tax paid to Ohthere by the Sami, and Ohthere said that walrus had &quot;very noble bones in their teeth&quot;, some of which he brought to King Alfred.

Anthropologist Ian Whitaker notes that Ohthere has been described as primarily a merchant, and that his visit to King Alfred has been connected with the king&#x27;s plans for a navy, a desire to escape the Norwegian King Harald Fairhair, or a need to rebuild a lost fortune. Whitaker notes also that there is &quot;no shred of evidence&quot; to support any of these ideas, but for the fact that he had visited the trading centres of &quot;Skiringshal&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;) and Hedeby. Ohthere said that he had travelled north chiefly to hunt walrus, and his journey south to the Danish trading settlement of Hedeby, via the &quot;port&quot; of &quot;Sciringes heal&quot;, may have been a trading mission. There is no account of Ohthere&#x27;s journey to Wessex or explanation for his visit to King Alfred.

==Ohthere&#x27;s Norway==
Ohthere&#x27;s reported use of the term &quot;Norway&quot; (&quot;norðweg&quot;) in the earliest copy of the Old English Orosius pre-dates the earliest written Scandinavian use of the term, in the runic form &quot;Nuruiak&quot;, on the 10th-century Jelling stones in Denmark by between 40 and 80 years. He describes Norway as being very long and very narrow, saying that it was about across &quot;to the east&quot;, about across in the middle, and about across in the north. While Ohthere is here referring broadly to the width of Norwegian territory between the sea and the mountains, the land described as being about 60 miles across &quot;to the east&quot; is probably to be understood as representing the modern Norwegian region of Vestlandet, in the south-west of the country.

The land of the Norwegians is further delineated through reference to their neighbours. Away from the sea, a wilderness of moors, or mountains, lay to the east and was inhabited by &quot;Finnas&quot;, a reference to the Sami people. Alongside the southern part of the land, on the other side of the mountains and continuing north, was &quot;Sweoland&quot;, the &quot;land of the Svear&quot;, or Swedes. To the north of the Swedes was &quot;Cwenaland&quot;, the &quot;land of the Cwenas&quot;, and to the north of the Norwegians was wasteland.

==Ohthere&#x27;s travels==
Ohthere described two journeys that he had made, one northward and around the Kola Peninsula into the White Sea, and one southward to the Danish trading settlement of Hedeby via a Norwegian &quot;port&quot; which, in the Old English Orosius, is called &quot;Sciringes heal&quot;. He described his journeys partly through the lands and peoples he encountered, and partly through the number of days it took to sail from one point to the next:

===Journey to the north===
Ohthere said that the land stretched far to the north of his home, and that it was all wasteland, except for a few places where &quot;finnas&quot; (Sami) camped to hunt in the winter and fish in the summer. He said that he once wanted to find out how far the land extended to the north, or if anyone lived north of the waste. He sailed north along the coast for three days, as far north as whale-hunters would go, and continued to travel north as far as he could sail in three days. Then the land there turned east (near North Cape), and he had to wait for a west wind and slightly north and then sailed east along the land for four days. Then he had to wait there for a wind from due north, for the land there turned to the south. He then sailed south along the land for another five days. There a large river stretched up into the land, and they turned up into that river because they dared not sail on beyond the river because of &quot;unfrið&quot; (usually translated as &quot;hostility&quot;), since the land was all settled on the other side of the river. He had not previously encountered any cultivated land since he travelled from his own home, but there was waste land all the way on his starboard side, except for fishermen and fowlers and hunters, and they were all &quot;finnas,&quot; and open sea had always been on his port side.

According to Ohthere, the far bank of the river was &quot;well cultivated&quot; and inhabited by &quot;Beormas&quot;: historian T.N. Jackson suggests a location for this land – &quot;Bjarmaland&quot; – in the vicinity of the present day Russian town of Kandalaksha, on the western side of the White Sea, while noting that others have identified Ohthere&#x27;s &quot;large river&quot; as the Northern Dvina, on the eastern side of the White Sea, and place Bjarmaland accordingly. Having just explained how Ohthere did not dare enter the land of the &quot;Beormas&quot; because it was so well cultivated and because of &quot;unfrið&quot;, the report of Ohthere&#x27;s travels then indicates that he had spoken with them. He explained that the &quot;Beormas&quot; had told him much about their own land and those of their neighbours, but he says nothing further of this: &quot;he knew not what was true, because he did not see it himself&quot;. This incongruity may be explained by his learning of these things from &quot;Beormas&quot; encountered elsewhere, or from Sami, whose language Ohthere reports as being almost the same as that of the &quot;Beormas&quot;. Historian Christine Fell suggests that the Old English Orosius&#x27; use of the word &quot;unfrið&quot; might rather indicate that Ohthere made a diplomatic approach to the &quot;Beormas&quot; because he had no trading agreement with them.

The &quot;Beormas&quot; have been linked with the Old Permic culture, for example through late-medieval treaties dealing with, among other things, a territory called &quot;Koloperem″&quot;, a place-name which &quot;must have emerged as a designation of a land of &quot;perem″&quot; [i.e. &quot;Beormas&quot;] on the Kola Peninsula&quot;: the latter forms the north-western coast of the White Sea, and is defined in part by an inlet of the sea leading to the town of Kandalaksha. The ethnicity of the &quot;Beormas&quot; and the &quot;Perm″&quot; remains uncertain, but the term &quot;perem&quot; may have originated as a word used for nomadic tradesmen, rather than an ethnic group.

Possible answers to incongruities and questions connected with Ohthere&#x27;s account of the journey to the north are offered in a recent contribution by Michael Korhammer. Most important of them is his proposal of a simple syntactical emendation of the traditional text after which the clause telling the killing of sixty (see above) will refer directly to the walruses, thus reducing Ohthere&#x27;s mention of the big whales in Norway to a mere aside. The logical consequences of this (well substantiated) emendation, if accepted, would be that Ohthere was no whale-hunter at all, that his killing of the sixty walruses took place in the White Sea, and that a ship&#x27;s crew of five (or six) men there would indicate the use of an early cargo-ship comparable to the later Skuldelev 1 or Skuldelev 3 ships. The author revives the old theory that Ohthere was an exile and had left Norway for good by pointing to the exclusive use of the Old English preterite tense regarding Ohthere&#x27;s person; he sees King Alfred&#x27;s interview with the Norwegian seafarer in the context of efforts to advance the economic recovery of the city of London.

===Journey south to Hedeby===
Ohthere&#x27;s account of a journey to the Danish trading settlement of Hedeby, Old English &quot;æt hæþum&quot; &quot;[port] at the heaths&quot; and German &quot;Haithabu&quot;, begins with a reference to a place in the south of Norway named &quot;Sciringes heal&quot;, to which he said one could not sail [from his home in Hålogaland] in one month if one camped at night and each day had a fair [or: contrary] wind (&quot;Þyder he cwæð þæt man ne mihte geseglian on anum monðe gyf man on niht wicode &quot;and&quot; ælce dæge hæfde ambyrne wind&quot;). This sentence has very often been quoted in literature. Old English &quot;ambyrne&quot; (accusative singular masculine; the nominative would be &quot;ambyre&quot;) is a hapax legomenon in Old English. Since around 1600 the traditionally accepted rendering of the phrase in English has been, without ultimate proof, &quot;fair/favourable wind&quot; in translations and dictionaries; on the other hand only a handful of scholars have supported the meaning &quot;contrary&quot;. In contrast to the account of his journey to the north (&quot;He sailed north&quot;, &quot;the land turned eastwards&quot; etc.) and the voyage from &quot;Sciringes heal&quot; to Hedeby (&quot;When he sailed&quot;, &quot;before he came to Hedeby&quot; etc.), Ohthere does not employ the past tense when he describes sailing south along the Norwegian coast; he does not report a story from his own viewpoint but speaks in general terms for an anonymous mariner: &quot;One cannot sail&quot;, &quot;if one camped at night&quot;, &quot;he will sail&quot;, &quot;to him will be at first&quot;, &quot;until he comes&quot;. Michael Korhammer, a proponent of &quot;contrary wind&quot;, concludes from this change of aspect that the &quot;ambyrne-wind&quot;-sentence is not about Ohthere&#x27;s own travelling experience nor does it refer to normal sailing speeds in his period, as was often assumed by critics, but answers a question of King Alfred&#x27;s court (see D. Whitelock above) about distances, &quot;how long is the North Way?&quot;, or &quot;how long is it from your home to the south?&quot;. Korhammer claims that Ohthere here uses the worst-case scenario of a theoretical sailing voyage lasting longer than one month for a description of the very great length of the Norwegian coast-line to his Anglo-Saxon audience. This interpretation is strengthened by the immediately following sentence &quot;and all the time he will sail &quot;be lande&quot;&quot;, and later when the mariner comes to &quot;Sciringes heal&quot;, by &quot;and all the way on the port side North Way&quot;.
While sailing along the Norwegian coast, the mariner will first have &quot;Iraland&quot; to starboard, then the islands between &quot;Iraland&quot; and Britain, and finally Britain itself until he comes to &quot;Sciringes heal&quot;. The principal interpretations of &quot;Iraland&quot; in the Old English Orosius are that it might mean either Ireland or Iceland. While it is possible that the original text of Ohthere&#x27;s account read &quot;Isaland&quot;, for &quot;Iceland&quot;, and that the &quot;s&quot; was at some point replaced by &quot;r&quot;, geographically the circumstances described are better suited for Iceland than for Ireland. Alternatively, given that &quot;Iraland&quot; occurs in the same form, with an &quot;r&quot;, twice on the same manuscript page, and given that Ohthere was a seafarer, it may be that he was describing sea-routes to Ireland and Britain rather than actual directions, with no thought for Iceland. Britain, or England, is regarded as self-evident, represented in Ohthere&#x27;s account through the phrase &quot;this land&quot; (&quot;þis land&quot;): Ohthere is reported as giving his account in person to King Alfred of Wessex.

&quot;Sciringes heal&quot; has been held to represent Skiringssal (Old Norse: &quot;Skíringssalr&quot;) in almost all relevant historical writing since the early 19th century, mainly by reason of the superficial similarity of the names, to the extent that some modern translations of Ohthere&#x27;s account feature the name &quot;Skiringssal&quot; in place of &quot;Sciringes heal&quot;. Skiringssal is a historical location, mentioned in Scandinavian sagas, which has been identified with some certainty as an area comparable to the parish of Tjølling, a little over east of Larvik, with important Viking Age archaeological sites at Huseby, just south of Tjølling, and at Kaupang, near the shoreline south-west of Tjølling, in the south-eastern county of Vestfold in modern Norway. An alternative view is that an identification of &quot;Sciringes heal&quot; with Skiringssal is impossible to reconcile with the detail of Ohthere&#x27;s account, and is unlikely for historical and linguistic reasons. According to this interpretation, a location for &quot;Sciringes heal&quot; west of Lindesnes, the southernmost extremity of Norway, is to be preferred, perhaps at Lunde on the Lista peninsula. Whether &quot;Sciringes heal&quot; was identical with Skiringssal, or was located in Tjølling parish or west of Lindesnes, it is described in Ohthere&#x27;s account in the Old English Orosius as a &quot;port&quot; (&quot;an port&quot;). Ohthere&#x27;s account uses the same word for the Danish trading settlement of Hedeby (&quot;þæm porte&quot;), suggesting that &quot;Sciringes heal&quot; may have been similar in nature, though the Old English word &quot;port&quot; can signify nothing more than a haven.

When Ohthere sailed on from &quot;Sciringes heal&quot;, he reported having first had Denmark to port and a wide sea to starboard for three days, after which for two days he had islands belonging to Denmark on his port side and Jutland (&quot;Gotland&quot; and &quot;Sillende&quot;) and many islands to starboard, before arriving at Hedeby, which lay at the head of the Schlei inlet in what was then south-eastern Denmark. It is in Ohthere&#x27;s description of this part of the journey that the earliest copy of the Old English Orosius gives the first known mention of the term &quot;Denmark&quot;, in the form &quot;dena mearc&quot;. However, his first reference to Denmark being on his port side presumably makes reference to areas of the 9th-century Danish kingdom that lay on the Scandinavian peninsula.

The reason for Ohthere&#x27;s visit to King Alfred of Wessex is not recorded. There is also no mention in the Old English Orosius of how recent the journeys were when Ohthere described them to the king, where the meeting took place, or the route by which Ohthere arrived in southern England.

==In modern culture==
Ohthere&#x27;s audience with King Alfred is dramatised in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;The Discoverer of the North Cape: A Leaf from King Alfred&#x27;s Orosius&quot;, and Ohthere and his journey appear in the 1957 novel &quot;The Lost Dragon of Wessex&quot; by Gwendolyn Bowers.

Ohthere is portrayed by Ray Stevenson in the historical drama &quot;Vikings&quot;.

<text>Muscimol (also known as agarin or pantherine) is one of the principal psychoactive constituents of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; and related species of mushroom. Muscimol is a potent and selective agonist for the GABAA receptor and displays sedative-hypnotic, depressant and hallucinogenic psychoactivity. This colorless or white solid is classified as an isoxazole.

Muscimol underwent a phase I clinical trial for epilepsy, but the trial was discontinued.

Muscimol, an agonist for the GABAA receptor, was able to significantly alleviate pain in its peak effect, recent studies from 2023 show. It has since been federally banned in Australia and is pending FDA review in the United States, but scientists believe it may relieve pain as well as some opioids without much of the risk of addiction associated with opioids. 

==Biochemistry==

The main natural sources of muscimol are fungi of the genus Amanita, such as &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (fly agaric) and &quot;Amanita pantherina&quot; (panther amanita). It is produced in the mushrooms along with muscarine (which is present in trace amounts and it is not active), muscazone, and ibotenic acid. In &quot;A. muscaria&quot;, the layer just below the skin of the cap contains the highest amount of muscimol, and is therefore the most psychoactive portion.

Muscimol is recognized as a potent agonist for ionotropic GABA-A receptors. By mimicking the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, muscimol activates these receptors, leading to the opening of chloride channels and subsequent hyperpolarization of neurons. This results in decreased neuronal excitability, which is crucial for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system.

The biochemical properties of muscimol make it a valuable tool for investigating GABAergic mechanisms. Its high affinity and specificity for GABA-A receptors allow researchers to study synaptic transmission, neural circuit dynamics, and the overall role of GABAergic inhibition in various physiological and pathological states.

== Pharmacology ==

Muscimol is a potent GABAA agonist, activating the receptor for the brain&#x27;s principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. Muscimol binds to the same site on the GABAA receptor complex as GABA itself, as opposed to other GABAergic drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines which bind to separate regulatory sites. GABAA receptors are widely distributed in the brain, and so when muscimol is administered, it alters neuronal activity in multiple regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. While muscimol is normally thought of as a selective GABAA agonist with exceptionally high affinity to GABAA-delta receptors, it is also a partial agonist at the GABAA-rho receptor, and so its range of effects results from a combined action on more than one GABAA receptor subtype.

Scientific studies have shown that dosing of the active ingredient muscimol is usually not precise as it has to be extracted from dried amanita mushroom. However, a psychoactive dose of muscimol is reported to be between 8 and 15 mg. As little as a gram of dried Amanita muscaria button may contain this amount of muscimol; however, the potency varies greatly among mushrooms.

When consumed, a substantial percentage of muscimol goes un-metabolized and thus excreted in urine, a phenomenon exploited by Siberian practitioners of the traditional entheogenic use of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;.

In patients with Huntington&#x27;s disease and chronic schizophrenia, oral doses of muscimol have been found to cause a rise of both prolactin and growth hormone.

During a test involving rabbits connected to an EEG, muscimol presented with a distinctly synchronized EEG tracing. This is substantially different from serotonergic psychedelics, with which brainwave patterns generally show a desynchronization. In higher doses (2 mg/kg via IV), the EEG will show characteristic spikes.

===Mechanism of action===
Muscimol primarily functions as a GABA-A receptor agonist, mimicking the action of GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, in the central nervous system. 

===Effects===
Muscimol, as a GABA-A receptor agonist, has shown diverse pharmacological effects, spanning neuroprotective, anti-nociceptive, and anti-epileptic activity.
Recent research has highlighted the following effects of muscimol:
* Neurotransmission Modulation: By mimicking GABA and binding to GABA-A receptors, muscimol enhances inhibitory neurotransmission. This results in reduced neuronal firing rates, contributing to the overall calming effect on the CNS. This modulation is crucial in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain.
* Migraine and Headache: Studies on migraine models demonstrated that extrasynaptic GABA-A receptor agonists like muscimol could prevent migraine-like phenotypes, offering new avenues for migraine treatment.
* Depressant Effects: By enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission, muscimol acts as a CNS depressant. This can lead to muscle relaxation, reduction in anxiety.
* Antinociceptive Properties: Muscimol has been found to have antinociceptive effects when used in combination with citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This additive effect highlights muscimol&#x27;s potential in pain management.
* Decision Making and Cognitive Function: Research on the role of the rat prelimbic cortex indicated that muscimol can influence decision-making processes. By infusing muscimol, researchers observed significant changes in cortical activity, which are crucial for understanding cognitive functions and cognitive disorders.
* Cerebral Ischemic Injury: Muscimol&#x27;s role in alleviating cerebral ischemic injury was explored, revealing its ability to suppress oxidative stress, autophagy, and apoptosis pathways. This research underscores muscimol&#x27;s potential in treating ischemic conditions.
* Pain Management: Activation of 5-HT5A receptors in the ventrolateral orbital cortex, alongside GABA-A receptor modulation by muscimol, showed significant antinociceptive effects in models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain.
* Epilepsy Models: In studies involving absence epilepsy models, muscimol demonstrated effects on T-type calcium channels and GABA receptors, providing insights into its anticonvulsant properties.
* Substance Use Disorders: Research into sex differences in GABA receptor regulation highlighted muscimol&#x27;s potential in addressing cocaine use disorder, emphasizing its role in GABAergic modulation.
* Neurological Pathways: Investigations into neural pathways for internal bias and sensory information interaction in decision-making processes showed the significant impact of muscimol on visual cortex neurons.

== Clinical research ==
Muscimol underwent a phase I clinical trial for epilepsy in 2012, but this trial was discontinued. 

A handful of exploratory clinical trials (n≤10) probing the utility of muscimol in the treatment of schizophrenia, Huntington&#x27;s disease, and tardive dyskinesia occurred between 1977-1982. The clinical investigation of muscimol in these conditions was superseded by gaboxadol, a conformationally constrained derivative of muscimol. Neither drug appeared to be efficacious in the treatment of Huntington&#x27;s disease or L-dopa/neuroleptic induced dyskinesia.

==Muscimol-based products==
Muscimol, a psychoactive compound derived from the ibotenic acid found in certain mushrooms, particularly &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, has garnered significant interest due to its unique effects on the nervous system. Muscimol binds to GABA receptors in the brain, resulting in its sedative and hallucinogenic properties. Muscimol-based products are currently being investigated for their potential therapeutic applications, especially in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and other neurological disorders. The psychoactive nature of muscimol necessitates stringent regulation and cautious usage to ensure safety. However, ongoing research aims to harness its medicinal benefits in a controlled context, highlighting the broader scientific interest in natural compounds as potential sources for novel medical treatments.

==Chemistry==
=== Structure ===
Muscimol was first isolated from &quot;Amanita pantherina&quot; by Onda in 1964, and thought to be an amino acid or peptide. Structure was then elucidated by Takemoto, Eugster, and Bowden. Muscimol is a semi-rigid isoxazole containing both alcohol and aminomethyl substituents. Muscimol is commonly portrayed as a tautomer, where it adopts an amide-like configuration. It is also commonly shown as a zwitterion.

===Isolation===
Muscimol can be extracted from the flesh of the &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; by treatment with boiling water, followed by rapid cooling, and further treatment with a basic resin. This is washed with water, and eluted with acetic acid using column chromatography. The eluate is freeze dried, dissolved in water, and passed down a column of cellulose phosphate. A subsequent elution with ammonium hydroxide and recrystallization from alcohol results in pure muscimol.

In instances where pure muscimol is not required, such as recreational or spiritual use, a crude extract is often prepared by simmering dried &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; in water for thirty minutes.

===Chemical synthesis===
Muscimol was synthesized in 1965 by Gagneux, who utilized a bromo-isoxazole starting material in a two step reaction. 3-bromo-5-aminomethyl-isoxazole (1) was refluxed in a mixture of methanol and potassium hydroxide for 30 hours, resulting in 3-methoxy-5-aminomethyl-isoxazole (2) with a yield of 60%. 
(2) was then refluxed in concentrated hydrochloric acid to hydrolyze the methoxy group, and the zwitterion crystallized from a solution of methanol and tetrahydrofuran after the addition of triethylamine, resulting in a 50% yield.

Chemists report having struggled to reproduce these results. More dependable and scalable procedures have been developed, two examples being the syntheses of McCarry and Varasi.

McCarry&#x27;s synthesis is a three step synthesis involving a lithium acetylide produced from propargyl chloride. The acetylide (3), was dissolved in ether, cooled to -40 °C, and treated with excess ethyl chloroformate to afford ethyl 4-chlorotetrolate (4) in a 70% yield. (4) was then added to a solution of water, methanol and hydroxylamine at -35 °C. At a pH of between 8.5 and 9, the isoxazole (5) was recovered in a 41% yield. Muscimol was formed in a 65% yield when (5) was dissolved in a saturated solution of methanol and anhydrous ammonia and heated from 0 °C to 50 °C. The total yield was 18.7%.
Varasi&#x27;s synthesis is notable for its inexpensive starting materials and mild conditions. It begins with the combination of 2,3-Dichloro-1-propene (6), potassium bicarbonate, water, and dibromoformaldoxime (7) (&quot;which is a well known precursor of bromo nitriloxyde, a reactive dipole for regioselective Diels-Alder cycloadditions, which forms in alkali&quot;), all dissolved in ethyl acetate. 5-Chloromethyl-3-bromoisoxazole (8) was extracted with an experimental yield of 81%. 5-Aminomethyl-3-bromoisoxazole (9) was formed in 90% yield by the combination of (8) and ammonium hydroxide in dioxane. 
(9) was then refluxed with potassium hydroxide in methanol to generate 5-Aminomethyl-3-methoxyisoxazole (10) with a 66% yield. Subsequent reflux of (10) with hydrobromic acid and acetic acid generated muscimol with a yield of 62%. The overall synthetic yield was 30%.
== Toxicity ==
The toxicity and safety profile of muscimol has been studied in various contexts, both experimental and clinical.

===Dose-dependent effects in primates===
A study on nonhuman primates indicated that muscimol, when administered in escalating doses, caused reversible hyperkinesia and dyskinesias at higher doses (up to 88.8 mM), but no long-term toxicity was observed on histological examination.

The median lethal dose in mice is 3.8 mg/kg s.c, 2.5 mg/kg i.p. The LD50 in rats is 4.5 mg/kg i.v, 45 mg/kg orally.

===Anticonvulsant properties===
Muscimol has shown potential as an anticonvulsant, blocking seizures induced by various agents in animal models without causing significant toxicity at therapeutic doses.

===Distribution and metabolism===
Studies on muscimol&#x27;s distribution in rats showed it enters the brain and is metabolized rapidly, suggesting that its toxicity is low when used in controlled doses.

Muscimol exhibits dose-dependent effects with higher doses leading to significant, but reversible, CNS symptoms. Its toxicity appears to be low when used in controlled environments, with no long-term damage observed in animal studies and human cases resolving without severe outcomes. However, caution is advised with its use due to its potent effects on the central nervous system.

==Legal status==

=== Australia ===
Muscimol is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance &quot;which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.&quot;

===United States===
Neither &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; nor muscimol is considered a controlled substance by the Federal government of the United States. This means that cultivation, possession, and distribution are unregulated by the United States Federal Government. The legality of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; and muscimol as ingredients in food is unclear since neither are approved as food additives by the FDA. However, agriculture regulators in Florida actioned against one seller of &quot;Amanita&quot; products after the agency had determined such products were considered adulterated under state law.

Muscimol may be regulated on a state level. Louisiana State Act 159 banned the possession and cultivation of the &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; except for ornamental or aesthetic purposes. Except as a constituent of lawfully manufactured food or dietary supplements, the act outlaws preparations of the &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; intended for human consumption, including muscimol.

<text>In distributed data storage, a P-Grid is a self-organizing structured peer-to-peer system, which can accommodate arbitrary key distributions (and hence support lexicographic key ordering and range queries), still providing storage load-balancing and efficient search by using randomized routing.

== Salient features ==

* Good storage load-balancing despite arbitrary load-distribution over the key-space.
* Range queries can be naturally supported and efficiently processed on P-Grid because P-Grid abstracts a trie-structure, and supports (rather) arbitrary distribution of keys, as observed in realistic scenarios.
* A Self-referential directory is realized to provide peer identity persistence over multiple sessions.
* A gossip primitive based update mechanism for keeping replicated content up-to-date.
* Easy merger of multiple P-Grids, and hence decentralized bootstrapping of the P-Grid network.
* Query-adaptive caching is easy to realize on P-Grid to provide query load-balancing where peers have restricted capacity.

== Overview ==
P-Grid abstracts a trie and resolves queries based on prefix matching. The actual topology has no hierarchy. Queries are resolved by matching prefixes. This also determines the choice of routing table entries. Each peer, for each level of the trie, maintains autonomously routing entries chosen randomly from the complementary sub-trees. In fact, multiple entries are maintained for each level at each peer to provide fault-tolerance (as well as potentially for query-load management). For diverse reasons including fault-tolerance and load-balancing, multiple peers are responsible for each leaf node in the P-Grid tree. These are called replicas. The replica peers maintain an independent replica sub-network and uses gossip based communication to keep the replica group up-to-date. The redundancy in both the replication of key-space partitions as well as the routing network together is called structural replication. The figure above shows how a query is resolved by forwarding it based on prefix matching.

== Range queries in P-Grid ==

P-Grid partitions the key-space in a granularity adaptive to the load at that part of the key-space. Consequently, its possible to realize a P-Grid overlay network where each peer has similar storage load even for non-uniform load distributions. This network probably provides as efficient search of keys as traditional distributed hash tables (DHTs) do. Note that in contrast to P-Grid, DHTs work efficiently only for uniform load-distributions.

Hence we can use a lexicographic order preserving function to generate the keys, and still realize a load-balanced P-Grid network which supports efficient search of exact keys. Moreover, because of the preservation of lexicographic ordering, range queries can be done efficiently and precisely on P-Grid. The trie-structure of P-Grid allows different range query strategies, processed serially or in parallel, trading off message overheads and query resolution latency. Simple vector-based data storage architectural frameworks are also subject to variable query limitations within the P-Grid environment.

<text>China National Highway 106 (G106; , 106 Guo Dao) is a road from Beijing to Guangzhou.

It leaves Beijing at Yuquanying and heads to Gu&#x27;an County, Bazhou (Hebei), Kaifeng (Henan), Ezhou (Hubei), and eventually Guangzhou (Guangdong) on the south China coast.

Within the Huangshi prefecture-level city In eastern Hubei (from near Ezhou and to the Jiangxi border), G106 coincides with G316.

<text>Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), also known as Lyell&#x27;s syndrome, is a type of severe skin reaction. Together with Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) it forms a spectrum of disease, with TEN being more severe. Early symptoms include fever and flu-like symptoms. A few days later the skin begins to blister and peel forming painful raw areas. Mucous membranes, such as the mouth, are also typically involved. Complications include dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and multiple organ failure.

The most common cause is certain medications such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, allopurinol, sulfonamide antibiotics, and nevirapine. Other causes can include infections such as &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; and cytomegalovirus or the cause may remain unknown. Risk factors include HIV/AIDS and systemic lupus erythematosus. Diagnosis is based on a skin biopsy and involvement of more than 30% of the skin. TEN is a type of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), together with SJS, a SJS/TEN, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. It is called SJS when less than 10% of the skin is involved and an intermediate form with 10 to 30% involvement. Erythema multiforme (EM) is generally considered a separate condition.

Treatment typically takes place in hospital such as in a burn unit or intensive care unit. Efforts include stopping the cause, pain medication, and antihistamines. Antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulins, and corticosteroids may also be used. Treatments do not typically change the course of the underlying disease. Together with SJS it affects 1 to 2 persons per million per year. It is more common in females than males. Typical onset is over the age of 40. Skin usually regrows over two to three weeks; however, recovery can take months and most are left with chronic problems.
==Signs and symptoms==

===Prodrome===
TEN ultimately results in extensive skin involvement with redness, necrosis, and detachment of the top (epidermal) layer of the skin and mucosa. Before these severe findings develop, people often have a flu-like prodrome, with a cough, runny nose, fever, decreased appetite and malaise. A history of drug exposure exists on average 14 days (ranging from 1–4 weeks) prior to the onset of symptoms, but may result as early as 48 hours if it is a reexposure.

===Skin findings===
Initial skin findings include red-purple, dusky, flat spots known as macules that start on the trunk and spread out from there. These skin lesions then transform into large blisters. The affected skin can then become necrotic or sag from the body and peel off in great swaths.

===Mucosal findings===
Nearly all people with TEN have oral, eye and genital involvement as well. Painful crusts and erosions may develop on any mucosal surface. The mouth becomes blistered and eroded, making eating difficult and sometimes necessitating feeding through a nasogastric tube through the nose or a gastric tube directly into the stomach. The eyes can become swollen, crusted, and ulcerated, leading to potential blindness. The most common problem with the eyes is severe conjunctivitis.

===Complications===

Those who survive the acute phase of TEN often develop long-term complications affecting the skin and eyes. Skin manifestations can include scarring, eruptive melanocytic nevi, vulvovaginal stenosis, and dyspareunia. The epithelium of the trachea, bronchi, or gastrointestinal tract may be involved in SJS and TEN. Ocular symptoms are the most common complication in TEN, experienced by 20–79% of those with TEN, even by those who do not experience immediate ocular manifestations. These can include dry eyes, photophobia, symblepharon, corneal scarring or xerosis, subconjunctival fibrosis, trichiasis, decreased visual acuity, and blindness.

==Cause==
Drug reactions have been reported to cause 80–95% of TEN cases.

The drugs most often implicated in TEN are:
* antibiotics
** sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine)
** beta-lactams (cephalosporins, penicillins, carbapenems)
* nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
* allopurinol
* antimetabolites (methotrexate)
* antiretroviral drugs (nevirapine)
* corticosteroids
* anxiolytics (chlormezanone)
* anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproic acid).

TEN has also been reported to result from infection with &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; or dengue virus. Contrast agents used in imaging studies as well as transplantation of bone marrow or organs have also been linked to TEN development.

===HIV===
HIV-positive individuals have 1000 times the risk of developing SJS/TEN compared to the general population. The reason for this increased risk is not clear.

===Genetics===
Certain genetic factors are associated with increased risk of TEN. For example, certain HLA-types such as, HLA-B*1502, HLA-A*3101, HLA-B*5801, and HLA‐B*57:01 have been seen to be linked with TEN development when exposed to specific drugs.

==Pathogenesis==
The immune system&#x27;s role in the precise pathogenesis of TEN remains unclear. It appears that a certain type of immune cell (cytotoxic CD8+ T cell) is primarily responsible for keratinocyte death and subsequent skin detachment. Keratinocytes are the cells found lower in the epidermis and specialize in holding the surrounding skin cells together. It is theorized that CD8+ immune cells become overactive by stimulation from drugs or drug metabolites. CD8+ T cells then mediate keratinocyte cell death through release of a number of molecules, including perforin, granzyme B, and granulysin. Other agents, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and Fas ligand, also appear to be involved in TEN pathogenesis.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of TEN is based on both clinical and histologic findings. Early TEN can resemble non-specific drug reactions, so clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for TEN. The presence of oral, ocular, and/or genital mucositis is helpful diagnostically, as these findings are present in nearly all patients with TEN. The Nikolsky sign (a separation of the papillary dermis from the basal layer upon gentle lateral pressure) and the Asboe-Hansen sign (a lateral extension of bullae with pressure) are also helpful diagnostic signs found in patients with TEN.

Given the significant morbidity and mortality from TEN, as well as improvement in outcome from prompt treatment, there is significant interest in the discovery of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of TEN. Serum granulysin and serum high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) are among a few of the markers being investigated which have shown promise in early research.

===Histology===
Definitive diagnosis of TEN often requires biopsy confirmation. Histologically, early TEN shows scattered necrotic keratinocytes. In more advanced TEN, full thickness epidermal necrosis is visualized, with a subepidermal split, and scant inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary dermis. Epidermal necrosis found on histology is a sensitive but nonspecific finding for TEN.

===Differential diagnosis===
* Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
* Drug-induced linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis
* Acute graft versus host disease
* Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis
* Erythroderma
* Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms aka DRESS
* A generalized morbilliform eruption

==Treatment==
The primary treatment of TEN is discontinuation of the causative factor(s), usually an offending drug, early referral and management in burn units or intensive care units, supportive management, and nutritional support.

Current literature does not convincingly support use of any adjuvant systemic therapy. Initial interest in Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) came from research showing that IVIG could inhibit Fas-FasL mediated keratinocyte apoptosis in vitro. Unfortunately, research studies reveal conflicting support for use of IVIG in treatment of TEN. Ability to draw more generalized conclusions from research to date has been limited by lack of controlled trials, and inconsistency in study design in terms of disease severity, IVIG dose, and timing of IVIG administration.
Larger, high quality trials are needed to assess the actual benefit of IVIG in TEN.

Numerous other adjuvant therapies have been tried in TEN including, corticosteroids, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis, pentoxifylline, acetylcysteine, ulinastatin, infliximab, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (if TEN associated-leukopenia exists). There is mixed evidence for use of corticosteroids and scant evidence for the other therapies. A meta-analysis from 2002 concluded that there is no reliable evidence for the treatment of TEN. Thalidomide did not show any benefit and was associated with increased mortality compared with placebo.

==Prognosis==
The mortality for toxic epidermal necrolysis is 25–30%. People with SJS or TEN caused by a medication have a better prognosis the earlier the causative medication is withdrawn. Loss of the skin leaves patients vulnerable to infections from fungi and bacteria, and can result in sepsis, the leading cause of death in the disease. Death is caused either by infection or by respiratory distress which is either due to pneumonia or damage to the linings of the airway. Microscopic analysis of tissue (especially the degree of dermal mononuclear inflammation and the degree of inflammation in general) can play a role in determining the prognosis of individual cases.

===Severity score===
The &quot;Severity of Illness Score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis&quot; (SCORTEN) is a scoring system developed to assess the severity of TEN and predict mortality in patients with acute TEN.

One point is given for each of the following factors:

* age &gt;40
* heart rate &gt;120 beats/minute
* carrying diagnosis of cancer
* separation of epidermis on more than ten percent of body surface area (BSA) on day 1.
* Blood Urea Nitrogen &gt;28 mg/dL
* Glucose &gt;252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L)
* Bicarbonate &lt;20mEq/L

====Score====
* 0–1: 3.2% mortality
* 2: 12.2% mortality
* 3: 35.3% mortality
* 4: 58.3% mortality
* ≥5: 90% mortality
Of note, this scoring system is most valuable when used on the first and third day of hospitalization, and it may underestimate mortality in patients with respiratory symptoms.

<doc id="944199" wikidata="Q1363732" url="?curid=944199" title="Erythema multiforme">
<text>Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition associated with several viral infections, that appears with red patches evolving into target lesions, typically on both hands. It is typically associated with infection by either herpes simplex virus or &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;.

It is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction in which T-lymphocytes target skin keratinocytes due to the presence of specific proteins that resemble antigens of HSV, &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, or other pathogens and foreign substances. It is an uncommon disorder, with peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. The disorder has various forms or presentations, which its name reflects (&quot;multiforme&quot;, &quot;&quot;, from &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;). Target lesions are a typical manifestation. Two standard types, one mild to moderate and one severe, are recognized (erythema multiforme minor and erythema multiforme major), as well as several rare and atypical types.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The condition varies from a mild, self-limited rash (E. multiforme minor) to a severe, life-threatening form known as erythema multiforme major (or erythema multiforme majus) that also involves mucous membranes.
Consensus classification:
* Erythema multiforme minor—typical targets or raised, edematous papules distributed 
* Erythema multiforme major—typical targets or raised, edematous papules distributed acrally with involvement of one or more mucous membranes; epidermal detachment involves less than 10% of total body surface area

The mild form usually presents with mildly itchy (but itching can be very severe), pink-red blotches, symmetrically arranged and starting on the extremities. It often takes on the classical &quot;target lesion&quot; appearance, with a pink-red ring around a pale center. Resolution within 7–10 days is the norm.

Individuals with persistent (chronic) erythema multiforme will often have a lesion form at an injury site, e.g. a minor scratch or abrasion, within a week. Irritation or even pressure from clothing will cause the erythema sore to continue to expand along its margins for weeks or months, long after the original sore at the center heals.

== Causes ==
Erythema multiforme typically arises as a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to certain infections or, rarely, certain medications. The most common trigger is an infection with any type of the herpes simplex virus. The second most common trigger, and the most common in children, is infection with &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, most commonly as an atypical pneumonia. When the body encounters these triggers, the immune system responds by activating various cells to fight off what it perceives as harmful invaders. Certain medications and other infections are also sometimes identified as causes of erythema multiforme, and while some experts doubt any true association with EM, others disagree, citing the lack of any HSV DNA found in cases of drug-associated EM.

The pathogenic immune response in EM involves both CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which orchestrate a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Upon activation, these T cells release proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. Despite the known association with IFN-γ, erythema multiforme is not considered a humorally-mediated autoimmune reaction.

Rarely, some patients may suffer from a persistent and treatment-resistant form of erythema multiforme caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. This pathology is distinct from the recurrent cases that sometimes arise from HSV-associated EM.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis used to be considered part of the erythema multiforme &quot;spectrum,&quot; but EM is now recognized as a fundamentally different condition. In addition to the differing pathogenesis, SJS/TEN also differs in its clinical characteristics, and may be excluded based on clinical characteristics alone.

=== Herpes simplex virus ===
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is by far the most frequent cause of erythema multiforme. HSV DNA is also detected in nearly half of patients with idiopathic EM, suggesting that the true frequency is even higher than traditionally thought. Because of this frequency, more is understood about EM caused by HSV than any other type.

100% of HSV-associated EM cases are found to have DNA for viral-type DNA polymerase (Pol) gene within keratinocytes. Despite this association, an active and infectious form of HSV has never been found in a patient suffering from EM, indicating that it is exclusively a post-viral hypersensitivity syndrome in these patients, rather than a symptom of the virus itself. The viral DNA polymerase protein is synthesized by basal keratinocytes, which then present the protein or fragments of its DNA to immune cells via MHC I. The resulting immune reaction results in the creation of CD8+ T-cells specific to HSV, which then induce a strong inflammatory response, recruiting other immune cells to places where infected keratinocytes are identified. Keratinocyte production of Pol protein only lasts for a few days, however, so most HSV-related cases of erythema multiforme do not become chronic or recurrent. However, recurrence is a known possibility with this type of EM, potentially justifying the use of preventative antiviral therapy.

== Treatment ==

Drug-induced erythema multiforme should be treated by immediately stopping the causative medication. Cases of idiopathic or infection-associated erythema multiforme may or may not be treated, depending on the underlying cause and the severity of the EM. Acute cases of erythema multiforme are often diagnosed clinically, based on symptom presentation, and treated with systemic steroid medications. Cases of EM known to be associated with HSV are frequently treated with antiviral medications such as acyclovir.

<text>Standartenführer (short: Staf, , ) was a Nazi Party (NSDAP) paramilitary rank that was used in several NSDAP organizations, such as the SA, SS, NSKK and the NSFK. First founded as a title in 1925, in 1928 it became one of the first commissioned NSDAP ranks and was bestowed upon those SA and SS officers who commanded a unit known as a &quot;Standarte&quot; (plural &quot;Standarten&quot;), a unit equivalent to an army battalion and comprising 300–500 personnel.

In 1929 the rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot; was divided into two separate ranks known as &quot;Standartenführer&quot; (I) and &quot;Standartenführer&quot; (II). This concept was abandoned in 1930 when both the SA and SS expanded their rank systems to allow for more officer positions and thus the need for only a single &quot;Standartenführer&quot; rank. In 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to national power in Germany, the rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot; had been established as the highest field officer rank, lower than that of &quot;Oberführer&quot; of the SS and SA. By the start of World War II, &quot;Standartenführer&quot; was widely spread as both an SS rank and a rank of the SA. In the Waffen-SS, the rank was considered the equivalent of an &quot;Oberst&quot;, a full colonel.

The insignia for &quot;Standartenführer&quot; consisted of a single oak leaf displayed on both collars. &quot;Standartenführer&quot; was the first of the SS and SA ranks to display rank insignia on both collars, without the display of unit insignia. From 1938, newer SS uniforms featured the shoulder boards of a German Army &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel) in addition to the oak leaf collar patches.

Various Waffen-SS units composed of foreign recruits were considered distinct from the German SS, and thus they were not permitted to wear SS runes on their collar tabs but had their unit symbol instead. Their ranks was also prepended with &quot;Waffen&quot; instead of &quot;SS&quot;, as in, Waffen-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;.

<doc id="944205" wikidata="Q3273875" url="?curid=944205" title="Jan Opletal">
<text>Jan Opletal (31 December 1914/1 January 1915 – 11 November 1939) was a student of the Medical Faculty of the Charles University in Prague, who was shot at a Czechoslovak Independence Day rally on 28 October 1939. He was severely injured at this anti-Nazi demonstration against the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and died two weeks later.

Jan Opletal is seen as a symbolic figure of the Czech resistance against Nazism.

== Life ==
Opletal came from modest circumstances. He was born in the village of Lhota nad Moravou (now part of Náklo) in central Moravia on New Year&#x27;s Day of 1915. He was the eighth child in the family of Anna and Štěpán Opletal. His parents officially declared his date of birth as 31 December 1914, in order to send him to school one year earlier. Opletal attended the elementary school in Náklo and then spent one year at the community school in Štěpánov. He planned to undergo training at the pump factory of the &quot;Brothers Sigmund&quot; in Lutín, but in 1926 he was admitted to the high school of Litovel, on the recommendation of his teachers who recognized his intelligence and discipline. He joined the gymnastics movement Sokol and also used their educational offerings. He completed his Abitur in 1934 with distinction. After that, he wanted to become a pilot and applied to the flying school of Prostějov, but he was not admitted due to his poor eyesight. He went on to become an officer at the Hranice na Moravě school for reserve officers and concluded his service in the Czechoslovak Army in a cavalry regiment.

In the winter semester of 1936–37 he began to study medicine at the Charles University in Prague.

On 28 October 1939, on the anniversary of the Czechoslovak independence, Jan Opletal and other medical students called for Resistance against the German occupation, and distributed flyers. Throughout the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the Czech population took part in strikes and demonstrations. In Prague more and more people gathered during the course of the day, singing the national anthem, demanding the return of Edvard Beneš and chanting anti-German slogans. Some threw stones at German-owned shops. Since the Czech police, who sympathized with the demonstrators, did not step in, German civilian policemen began to shoot into the crowd. The worker Václav Sedláček was shot to death and Jan Opletal was seriously injured by a shot in his abdomen. Opletal succumbed to his injury on 11 November 1939.

On 15 November 1939 he was laid out and driven through Prague. More than 3,000 students were present at the memorial event at the Institute of Pathology and the adjacent chapel. Hundreds of students followed his coffin afterwards, and more and more local people joined the march. His coffin was taken to the station for transport to his native village in Moravia, where the crowd, now thousands strong, intonated the Czech hymn Kde domov můj. The funeral procession continued to Charles Square, where it came into confrontation with Czech police. The students withdrew into the building of the Technical University. They were allowed to leave only in small groups under supervision, but they later joined again to form a procession with several thousand participants, which tried to break through to the city center. It turned into another anti-Nazi demonstration after the silent march of 28 October. As a result, the Reichsprotektor Konstantin von Neurath, the Nazi-representative heading the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, started the so-called Sonderaktion Prag on 17 November 1939. He closed all Czech universities and colleges, had 1,850 students arrested and ordered the execution of nine student leaders, including František Skorkovský. Over 1,200 Czech students were interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.
Opletal&#x27;s remains were transferred to his native village of Náklo in the Olomouc Region. The murder of Jan Opletal and the subsequent closure of the Prague University led to solidarity demonstrations at the University of Belgrade on 18 November 1939.

== Velvet Revolution ==

On the 50th anniversary of the Sonderaktion Prag, 16 and 17 November 1989, demonstrations were held in Bratislava and Prague. The uprising finally led to the Velvet Revolution and the election of Václav Havel as President on 29 December 1989. The Prague demonstrators chose the same route taken by the funeral procession for Jan Opletal 50 years earlier: from Albertov via the Národní třída to Wenceslas Square.

== Accolades ==
* 1945: Title &quot;MUDr.&quot; (equivalent of M.D.) &quot;in memoriam&quot; of the Charles University in Prague.
* 1996: Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (1. Class) &quot;postum&quot;

==Remembrance==
In the Czech Republic, numerous streets are named after Jan Opletal, including streets in Brno, Jablonec nad Nisou, Most, Olomouc, Poděbrady, Prague and Řevnice. The high school in Litovel, which he attended, now bears his name. Furthermore, there are a number of monuments to him, including a memorial stone in the forest west of Březina u Křtin.

Since 1941, the events of 17 November 1939 are commemorated as International Students Day by the International Union of Students and other groups. A Jan Opletal Prize is awarded each year by the European Students&#x27; Union on this occasion.

In 1989, and again in 2015, commemorative stamps were issued in memory of Jan Opletal.

<text>General Sir Colin Halkett (7 September 1774 – 24 September 1856) was a British Army officer who became Lieutenant Governor of Jersey.

==Family==
Halkett came from a military family. His father was Major General Frederick Godar Halkett and his younger brother was General Hugh Halkett.

==Military career==
Halkett began his military career in the Dutch Guards and served in various companies for three years, leaving as a captain in 1795.

From 1800 to 1801 he commanded Dutch troops on the Island of Guernsey. On 28 July 1803, a letter of service was issued to Major Halkett (and to Lieutenant Colonel von der Decken) empowering him &quot;to raise a battalion of infantry with an establishment of four hundred and fifty-nine men&quot; and offering him the rank of lieutenant colonel should he increase the number to eight hundred men. These men formed the nucleus of what was to become the King&#x27;s German Legion in December 1803. On 17 November 1803, Halkett was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and given command of the 2nd Light Infantry Battalion. This Battalion was involved in Cathcart&#x27;s expeditions to Hanover, Rügen and Copenhagen.

===Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign===
In 1811 he was given command of the Light Brigade of the King&#x27;s German Legion. He held this command throughout the Peninsular War from Albuera to Toulouse. On 1 January 1812 he was promoted to colonel. At the Battle of Salamanca (22 July 1812), he commanded 1st Brigade of the 7th Division under Major General Hope.

Halkett was promoted to Major General on 4 June 1814.

On 18 June 1815, at the Battle of Waterloo he commanded the 5th Brigade in the 3rd Division, under the command of Major General Carl von Alten. He was wounded four times during the course of the battle.

Late in the afternoon, Wellington rode up to the 5th Brigade. The situation was desperate, and casualties were mounting. Halkett asked the Duke, &#x27;My Lord, we are dreadfully cut up; can you not relieve us for a little while?’ &#x27;Impossible!’ Wellington replied. &#x27;Very well My Lord, we&#x27;ll stand until the last man falls&#x27;, was Halkett&#x27;s answer.

==Governor==
Halkett became Lieutenant Governor of Jersey in 1821 and was the first Lieutenant Governor to reside in the St Saviour Government House, still in use today. During this time he married Letitia Cricket, widow of Captain Tyle of the Royal Artillery. He had a son, Frederick (John) Colin Halkett, on 10 June 1826. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 22 July 1830 and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army in January 1832. He was Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1849 until his death in 1856.

He was appointed colonel of the 71st Regiment of Foot on 21 September 1829. On 28 March 1838 he was removed to the 31st Regiment of Foot, and to the 45th Regiment of Foot on 12 July 1847.

Two streets in Saint Helier are named after him.

<doc id="944208" wikidata="Q7175735" url="?curid=944208" title="Peter McAleese">
<text>Peter McAleese (7 September 1942 – 18 March 2024) was a Scottish soldier and mercenary.

McAleese served in the British Army&#x27;s Parachute Regiment and Special Air Service (SAS), the Rhodesian Special Air Service and British South Africa Police, and South Africa&#x27;s 44 Parachute Brigade. As a mercenary or contractor, he worked in countries including South Africa, Angola, Colombia, Russia, Algeria and Iraq.

McAleese was the author of the book &quot;No Mean Soldier&quot;.

==Early life==
McAleese was born into a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent in Glasgow, Scotland, within sight of Barlinnie Prison, and spent his childhood years in the city&#x27;s Riddrie district. Growing up he was often beaten by his father, who had served in the military and had a reputation for being an aggressive fighting man.

==Military career==
McAleese enlisted with the British Army&#x27;s Parachute Regiment in Aberdeen in 1960 at the age of 17. After basic training at the Parachute Regiment&#x27;s Aldershot depot, he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment&#x27;s mortar platoon. In 1962 McAleese transferred to &#x27;D&#x27; Squadron, 22 SAS, where he served with the squadron&#x27;s Mobility troop in Aden. After a few months he was returned to unit from the SAS for disciplinary reasons, re-joining 1 Para, where he was posted to Bahrain and Cyprus in 1962–64. In 1964 he re-joined the SAS and served with &#x27;D&#x27; Squadron&#x27;s 16 (Air) Troop in Borneo and in the Aden Emergency. In 1968 he was again returned to the Parachute Regiment by the SAS for disciplinary offences related to violent disorder, rejoining 1 Para, which he served with from 1968 to 1969 as a sergeant-instructor. In 1969 McAleese resigned from the British Army.

McAleese served three prison sentences in the early 1970s following convictions for violence and was incarcerated at HMP Gloucester. On release from prison for the third time he left the United Kingdom for Africa, where he was a mercenary soldier in the Angolan Civil War for several months in 1976, fighting for the National Liberation Front of Angola, assuming command of the formation after the capture of Costas Georgiou.

In early 1977, McAleese moved to Rhodesia and enlisted with the Rhodesian Special Air Service, being assigned to its &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron, fighting in the Rhodesian Bush War with the rank of a non-commissioned officer. In 1979, he joined the British South Africa Police&#x27;s Special Branch operating in South Rhodesia. 
After the fall of Rhodesia in 1980, he enlisted with the South African Defence Force&#x27;s 44 Parachute Brigade, where he served as a Warrant Officer Class 2 to 1984. He assisted with the creation of a new pathfinder reconnaissance unit, and took part in the South African Border War.

==Security contracting career==
In the mid-1980s McAleese set up a family home in Pretoria, and became an employee of the COIN Security Group, a military/police private contractor based in South Africa. After a near-death parachuting display accident, he moved back to live in the United Kingdom. At the end of the 1980s, he spent two years as a security contractor working for the government forces during the &quot;Colombian conflict&quot;. In the mid-1990s he worked in Moscow as a bodyguard training instructor, and undertook security work in Algeria and Iraq for several years.

McAleese was contracted in 1989 by the Colombian Cali Cartel to assassinate their rival, Pablo Escobar. He and his team of mercenaries failed in their attempt, which was the subject of the 2021 UK documentary film &quot;Killing Escobar&quot;. Filmed interviews with him and some of his colleagues form the core of the narrative.

==Retirement and Death ==
In his latter years, McAleese was a pub landlord in England. In 1993, he published his memoir, entitled &quot;No Mean Soldier&quot;, which has been reprinted several times.

McAleese died on 18 March 2024, at the age of 81.

There are generally two types of trials, criminal and civil. The hierarchy of courts begins from the Magistrates&#x27; Court, Sessions Court, High Court, Court of Appeal, and finally, the Federal Court. The jurisdiction of the courts in civil or criminal matters are contained in the Subordinate Courts Act 1948 and the Courts of Judicature Act 1964. Article 121 of the Constitution provides for two High Courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction, the High Court in Malaya, and the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak. Thus this creates two separate local jurisdiction of the courts – for Peninsular Malaysia and for East Malaysia. The highest position in the judiciary of Malaysia is the Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Malaysia (also known as the Chief Justice of Malaysia), followed by the President of the Court of Appeal, the Chief Judge of Malaya, and the Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak. The superior courts are the High Court, Court of Appeal, and the Federal Court, while the Magistrates&#x27; Courts and the Sessions Courts are classified as subordinate courts.

The current Chief Justice of the Federal Court effective 2 May 2019 is Yang Amat Arif Tun Tengku Maimun binti Tuan Mat, the President of the Court of Appeal is Tan Sri Datuk Amar Abang Iskandar bin Abang Hashim, and the Chief Judge of Malaya is Tan Sri Dato&#x27; Mohamad Zabidin bin Mohd Diah. The current Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak is Tan Sri Dato’ Abdul Rahman bin Sebli.

Since 2003, the two highest courts of the country, namely the Federal Court and the Court of Appeal, have been located at the Palace of Justice, Putrajaya. 

===Superior courts===
====Federal Court====

The Federal Court is the highest court in Malaysia. The Federal Court may hear appeals of civil decisions of the Court of Appeal where the Federal Court grants leave to do so. The Federal Court also hears criminal appeals from the Court of Appeal, but only in respect of matters heard by the High Court in its original jurisdiction (i.e. where the case has not been appealed from the Subordinate Courts).

====Court of Appeal====

The Court of Appeal generally hears all civil appeals against decisions of the High Courts except where against judgment or orders made by consent. In cases where the claim is less than RM250,000, the judgment or order relates to costs only, and the appeal is against a decision of a judge in chambers on an interpleader summons on undisputed facts, the leave of the Court of Appeal must first be obtained. The Court of Appeal also hears appeals of criminal decisions of the High Court. It is the court of final jurisdiction for cases which began in any subordinate courts.

====High Courts====

The two High Courts in Malaysia have general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all the Subordinate Courts, and jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Subordinate Courts in civil and criminal matters.

The High Courts have unlimited civil jurisdiction, and generally hear actions where the claim exceeds RM1,000,000, other than actions involving motor vehicle accidents, landlord and tenant disputes and distress. The High Courts hear all matters relating to:
* the validity or dissolution of marriage (divorce) and matrimonial causes,
* bankruptcy and matters relating to the winding-up of companies,
* guardianship or custody of children,
* grants of probate, wills and letters of administration of estates,
* injunctions, specific performance or rescissions of contracts,
* legitimacy of persons.
The High Courts have unlimited jurisdiction in all criminal matters other than matters involving Islamic law. The High Courts have original jurisdiction in criminal cases punishable by death.

Cases are heard by a single judge in the High Court, or by a judicial commissioner. While High Court judges enjoy security of tenure, judicial commissioners are appointed for a term of two years, and do not enjoy similar protection under the Constitution.

An application for a judicial review is applied in this court.

===Subordinate courts===
The Magistrates&#x27; Courts and Sessions Courts in Malaysia have the power in both criminal and civil matters.

====Sessions Courts====
Somewhat like the former Quarter Sessions in England, but does not exceed RM1,000,000 as per ss 65(1)(b), 73(b), 93(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act 1948 (SCA). The exception however is in matters relating to motor vehicle accidents, landlord and tenant and distress, where the Sessions Courts have unlimited jurisdiction pursuant to s 65(1)(a)SCA. Also, by virtue of s 65(3) SCA, the parties to a legal action may enter into an agreement in writing to grant jurisdiction to the Sessions Court to try an action beyond its prescribed monetary jurisdiction aforesaid.

====Magistrates Courts====
Magistrates are divided into First Class and Second Class Magistrates, the former being legally qualified and having greater powers. Second Class Magistrates are normally appointed.

====Other courts====
The court of a &quot;penghulu&quot;, or Malay village head, has the power to hear civil matters of which the claim does not exceed RM50, where the parties are of an Asian race and speak and understand the Malay language.

The Penghulu Court&#x27;s criminal jurisdiction is limited to offences of a minor nature charged against a person of Asian race which is specially enumerated in his warrant, which can be punished with a fine not exceeding RM25. However, the Penghulu Court has been abolished since 1 March 2013.

In Sabah and Sarawak, there are no Penghulus&#x27; Courts, but there are instead Native Courts (Malay: &quot;Mahkamah Anak Negeri&quot;) having jurisdiction on matters of native law and custom.

The Court for Children, previously known as the Juvenile Court, hears cases involving minors except cases carrying the death penalty, which are heard in High Courts instead. Cases for children are governed by the Child Act 2001. A child is defined as any person below the age of 18.

The Special Court was established in 1993 to hear cases of offences or wrongdoings made by a Ruler. A Ruler includes the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King), the sultans of monarchical states in Malaysia, the Yang di-Pertua Negeri, and the Yang di-Pertuan Besar, i.e.: the head of states of Malaysia and its component states. Prior to this, a Ruler was immune from any proceedings brought against them in their personal capacity. &quot;Faridah Begum bte Abdullah v Ahmad Shah&quot; was the first case to be heard in this court.

===Syariah Courts===

There is a parallel system of state Syariah Courts which has limited jurisdiction over matters of state Islamic (sharia) law. The Syariah Courts have jurisdiction only over matters involving Muslims, and can generally only pass sentences of not more than three years imprisonment, a fine of up to RM5,000, and/or up to six strokes of the cane.

==Appointment of judges==
The appointment of the Chief Justice is governed by Article 122B of the Constitution of Malaysia whereby the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) appoints the Chief Justice on the advice of the Prime Minister of Malaysia after consulting the Conference of Rulers. As for the appointment of the President of the Court of Appeal, the Chief Judge of Malaya, the Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak, and other Federal Court judges, similar procedure is taken with the additional requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice.

The appointment of Court of Appeal judges is also governed by the same procedures with the additional requirement for the consultation of the President of the Court of Appeal. As for the appointment of High Court judges, similar procedures are prescribed with the additional requirement of consultation with the respective Chief Judges.

The appointment of Sessions Court judges is governed by Section 59 of the Subordinate Court Act 1948. They are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong upon the advice of the respective Chief Judges.

Section 78 of the Subordinate Courts Act 1948 provides that the appointment of magistrates are done by the respective state government upon the advice of the respective Chief Judges, except for magistrates in the Federal Territory, where they are appointed by the —Yang di-Pertuan Agong upon the advice of the Chief Judge.

==List of chief justices of the Federal Court==

<text>ThyssenKrupp AG (, ; stylized as thyssenkrupp) is a German industrial engineering and steel production multinational conglomerate. It resulted from the 1999 merger of Thyssen AG and Krupp and has its operational headquarters in Duisburg and Essen. The company says that it is one of the largest steel producers in the world, and it was ranked tenth-largest worldwide by revenue in 2015. It is divided into 670 subsidiaries worldwide. The largest shareholders are the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation and Cevian Capital. ThyssenKrupp&#x27;s products range from machines and industrial services to high-speed trains, elevators, and shipbuilding. The subsidiary ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems also manufactures frigates, corvettes, and submarines for the German and foreign navies.

==History==
ThyssenKrupp is the result of a merger of two German steel companies, Thyssen AG founded in 1891 under the name &quot;Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser&quot; and Krupp founded in 1811. As early as the 1980s, the companies began negotiations on a merger and began closely cooperating in some business areas. In 1997, the companies combined their flat steel activities, with a full merger completed in March 1999.

===Beginnings (1811–1891)===
Krupp
* 1811: Friedrich Carl Krupp established a cast steel factory in Essen, Germany.
* 1826: After Friedrich Krupp&#x27;s death in 1826, his widow Therese Krupp ran the company together with other relatives and her eldest son Alfred, who was 14 years old at the time.
* 1833: Krupp manufactures complete rolling machines.
* 1847: Expansion of the railroads increases the demand for durable cast steel, triggering the company&#x27;s first surge of growth. Supplies include axles, springs, and seamless tires that can withstand increasing speed without cracking.
* 1859: The Prussian military orders 300 gun barrels, marking the development of the company&#x27;s second major production segment; shortly after Krupp begins producing complete artillery.
* 1862: Construction of the first Bessemer steel plant on the continent for mass production of rails and steel sheets.
* 1864–1872: The company purchases various iron ore mines to avoid dependency on external suppliers. In 1873, Krupp established his own shipping company in Rotterdam to transport ore from the Spanish company Orconera Iron Ore Co., in which he owned shares.
* 1872: Alfred Krupp issues a &quot;General Directive&quot; establishing company hierarchy from foreman to management. Included in the directive are regulations concerning company welfare programs, including the pension fund, sickness, and death benefit insurance, company bakery and retail store, worker housing estates, and health care, all of which were slowly introduced beginning in 1836.

Thyssen

* 1867: Establishment of Thyssen, Fossoul &amp; Co., a company making hoop iron for barrels, crates, baling, etc.
* 1871: Establishment of Thyssen &amp; Co. in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany
* 1891: August Thyssen becomes the owner of the Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser coal mine in Hamborn near Duisburg. One year earlier, the Thyssen company constructed a steel mill directly adjacent to one of the pits, thus Thyssen grows into an iron and steel mill with its own coal base.

===Wilhelminian period (1892–1917)===
Krupp
* 1893: After the death of Alfred Krupp in 1887, Friedrich Alfred Krupp expands his father&#x27;s enterprise with takeovers of additional steel mills and shipyards and construction of diesel engines in collaboration with Rudolf Diesel.
* 1899: With the acquisition of and/or increased investment in various coal mines (Hannibal colliery near Bochum and the Emscher-Lippe coal mine near Datteln) business development concentrates on vertical structures with the expansion of a coal base.
* 1903: Friedrich Alfred Krupp dies suddenly in 1902 at the age of 48 and his eldest daughter Bertha Krupp inherits the company. The company is converted into a stock corporation by the will of the late owner; Bertha retains all the stock. As she is still a minor, her mother Margarethe Krupp as guardian and proprietor takes over as the head of the company, managed by a board of directors.
* 1906: Bertha Krupp marries Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach who adds the Krupp name as a prefix to his own family name. He is appointed vice-chairman of the board and serves as chairman through 1943.
* 1912: Development of stainless, acid-resistant steels quickly finds application in the chemical and food processing industries, medicine, and building. The spire of New York&#x27;s Chrysler Building is clad in the new stainless steel panels.
* 1917: The &quot;Paris Gun&quot; is developed with a range of .

Thyssen
* 1895: Thyssen sets up integrated iron and steel mill with the construction of a blast furnace plant at the Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser. Expansion later is focused on vertical integration of the group.
* 1906: Intra-company trading and shipping organizations are established to facilitate the transport of iron ore to the blast furnace plants. In 1910, the N.V. Handels- en Transport Maatschappij Vulcaan ocean shipping company is established in Rotterdam to keep the Thyssen group independent of the international freight market.
* 1910: Expansion with mills in the Lorraine and in Normandy.
* 1912: Various branches are set up in the Mediterranean area (Algiers, Port Said, Suez, Oran, Naples, Bona, Bizerte, Tangier, and Genoa) so that freighters can store coal en route to Russian or Indian ore mines besides delivery of coal or freight for third parties.
* 1913: Attention is paid to Latin America with the founding of the &quot;Deutsch-Überseeische Handelsgesellschaft&quot; (German Overseas Trading Company). Thyssen constructs extensive housing estates and related infrastructure to attract workers to the western Ruhr area. By the end of 1913, Thyssen owns 8,750 housing units for 15,500 employees and 850 civil servants: housing for 44,000 people.
* 1914: Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser begins producing armaments for the First World War. To compensate for labor shortages, women, civilians from Belgium, and prisoners of war work for the company.

===Weimar Republic (1918–1933)===
Krupp
* 1919: After the Treaty of Versailles, Krupp reverts to peace-time production focusing on the manufacture of locomotives, trucks, agricultural machinery, and excavators. The post-war circumstances of inflation, occupation, and dismantling of the company&#x27;s industrial infrastructure led to a financial crisis in 1924/25. The company stabilizes by, among other measures, streamlining processing operations and expanding stainless steel production.
* 1926: Sintered tungsten carbide was developed by Osram as a material for machining metal. In 1925, Krupp buys the licence and launches sintered carbide onto the market, exploiting its exceptional hardness and wear resistance, which represents a breakthrough in tool engineering.
* 1929: A 15,000-ton forging press goes into operation in Essen-Borbeck. It is at the time the largest worldwide.

Thyssen
* 1919: The company is renamed from Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser to August Thyssen-Hütte; Gewerkschaft and mining operations are transferred to an independent company, Gewerkschaft Friedrich Thyssen. The company&#x27;s foreign interests in the Allied and Soviet countries are expropriated.
* 1926: Major parts of the Thyssen group are transferred to a newly merged group, Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, bringing together several coal and steel companies in the Ruhr area to solve cost and production problems of excess capacities. August Thyssen dies at Schloss Landsberg near Essen. His sons Fritz Thyssen and Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza inherit the industrial enterprises. His other two children, Hedwig and August Jr., are compensated differently.

===Nazi Germany (1933–1945)===
Krupp
* 1930-1933: Thyssen and Krupp were among the industrialists who originally saw Hitler&#x27;s movement as flawed and stayed away. It was during this period, however, they and others were persuaded to assist the Nazi movement or face threats. And thus in the end, both contributed greatly to the Nazi political and war efforts. (Shirer, William, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.&quot;)

* 1937: As dictated by Hitler&#x27;s Four-Year Plan, production of locomotives, trucks, and ships was expanded and armaments production resumed.
* 1941: Krupp Germania shipyard was extended with the acquisition of Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG &quot;Deschimag&quot; to include larger ships and submarines. Krupp took advantage of foreign labourers, slave labourers, prisoners of war, and Jews to compensate for labour shortages. It is estimated that a total of 100,000 people were forced to work by the company. Moreover, it had a workshop near the Auschwitz complex. Due to the company&#x27;s involvement in the war, Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was then convicted for crimes against humanity and received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment during The United States of America vs. Alfried Krupp, et al., trial of 8 December 1947 – 31 July 1948.

Thyssen
* 1934: The company August Thyssen-Hütte AG is spun off the Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG as a so-called operating company.
* 1939: Fritz Thyssen, chairman of the Board of Vereingte Stahlwerke AG, flees to Switzerland after the invasion of Poland. Vichy France hands over Thyssen and his wife to the German Reich at the end of 1940.
* 1940: A rearmament policy is introduced by the Nazis in the mid-1930s and with the outbreak of war, labor is conscripted and supplemented by foreign workers, slave laborers, and prisoners of war.
* 1945: Thyssenhütte mill in Hamborn occupied by US troops.

===Mergers and acquisitions===

During a period of expansion in 1978, Thyssen AG entered the North American automotive industry with the acquisition of Budd&#x27;s automotive operations, which became the automotive division of Thyssen and operated in North America as Budd Thyssen, later ThyssenKrupp Budd Incorporated. In October 2006, ThyssenKrupp sold ThyssenKrupp Budd&#x27;s North American body and chassis operations to Martinrea International Inc.

In 1988, ThyssenKrupp acquired German shock absorber manufacturer Bilstein, when it became a division until 2005, when it became a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1991, ThyssenKrupp acquired German company Hoesch AG. In 1999, Thyssen (one of the companies of the merger to form Thyssenkrupp Elevator) acquired the elevator division of American-based conglomerate Dover Corporation. Four years later, ThyssenKrupp acquired the Korean-based Dongyang Elevator.

In 2005, ThyssenKrupp acquired Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) in Kiel from One Equity Partners. One Equity Partners holds 25% of the TKMS shares. In December 2005, ThyssenKrupp acquired 60% of Atlas Elektronik from BAE Systems, with EADS acquiring the remaining 40%.

In August 2007, ThyssenKrupp Materials North America acquired OnlineMetals.com, a small-quantity distributor of semi-finished metals and plastics based in Seattle. In early 2008, ThyssenKrupp Aerospace acquired Apollo Metals and Aviation Metals, both suppliers to aerospace and defence based in Kent, Washington.

In 2011, ThyssenKrupp sold XERVON to Remondis. 

In June 2012, ThyssenKrupp sold Thyssenkrupp Waupaca to KPS Capital Partners. ThyssenKrupp Waupaca is a tier two supplier to the automotive industry, located in Waupaca, Wisconsin. In April 2014, ThyssenKrupp announced it was in talks to sell its Swedish maritime defence unit to Saab after failing to agree deals with the Swedish government for a new generation of submarines.

ThyssenKrupp Access, the global manufacturer of home elevators, wheelchair lifts, and stairlifts, has linked up with Chennai-based Indian Company Elite Elevators. The company has launched luxury home elevators segments targeting HNI Clientele to launch high-end elevators in India. In June 2018, Thyssenkrupp signed a final agreement with India&#x27;s Tata Steel to establish a long-expected steel venture. The 50-50 joint venture was called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel and it became the second-largest steel producer in Europe, after ArcelorMittal.

In 2018, ThyssenKrupp announced that the company would split into two companies, ThyssenKrupp Industrials and ThyssenKrupp Materials, but this plan was cancelled in May 2019.

On 1 October 2023 the firm instituted a green energy division, Decarbon Technologies, to develop its energy solutions.

===Divestments and Restructures of Steel Business===

====Steel Europe====
In September 2017, ThyssenKrupp and India-based Tata Steel announced plans to combine their European steel-making businesses. The final agreement was signed in June 2018. The deal would have structured the European assets as ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel, a 50–50 joint venture headquartered in Amsterdam and created the second-largest steel producer in Europe. The merger was finally prohibited by the EU Commission in 2019 for competitive concerns.

====Steel Americas====

On 11 May 2007, ThyssenKrupp AG invested €3.1 billion (increased to $4.6 billion in 2010) for a project consisting of building new carbon steel and stainless steel processing facilities in Calvert, Alabama about 40 miles north of Mobile. The project, along with a multibillion-dollar greenfield steel-making facility in Brazil, was a cornerstone of ThyssenKrupp&#x27;s new global expansion strategy into the North American steel markets. The carbon steel and stainless steel companies were independent and operated under different management teams. Co-locating both facilities on the same site enabled the company to optimize the investment in infrastructure and in some shared processing.

Additionally, the Alabama State Port Authority invested over $100 million to build a state-of-the-art transloading slab terminal on the southern tip of Pinto Island in Mobile Bay to service the inbound raw material slabs for the upriver carbon steel facility. The terminal was necessary since the Tombigbee River depth and lack of turning basins prohibit deep draft ship navigation to the site in Calvert.

The world steel industry peaked in 2007, just as the company spent $12 billion to build the two most modern mills in the world, in Alabama and Brazil. The worldwide Great Recession started in 2008. Heavy cutbacks in construction combined with sharply lowered demand, and prices fell 40%. ThyssenKrupp lost $11 billion on its two new plants, which sold steel below the cost of production. ThyssenKrupp&#x27;s stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the US plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012. Finally in 2013, ThyssenKrupp offered the remaining portion of the plant for sale at under $4 billion. They sold it to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel the following year for $1.55 billion.
In February 2017, it agreed to sell its Brazilian steel business CSA to Ternium for €1.5 billion. The two transactions meant that Thyssenkrupp fully parted from the Steel Americas business.

====ThyssenKrupp Tailored Blanks====
In September 2012, ThyssenKrupp agreed to sell the automotive components manufacturer Tailored Blanks to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, based in China for an undisclosed price. At the time of the agreement Tailored Blanks had annual sales of around 700 million euros and a global market share of about 40 percent in automotive laser-welded blanks.

====ThyssenKrupp Elevator====
In April 2015, ThyssenKrupp announced it would invest more than €800 million in the North American region by 2020 to take advantage of the economy&#x27;s reindustrialization. In February 2020, ThyssenKrupp AG&#x27;s board announced that it would sell its elevator segment to Advent International, Cinven, and RAG foundation for $18.9 billion. The transaction closed in July 2020, and the new stand-alone company was named .

==Financial data==
==Carbon footprint==
ThyssenKrupp reported Total e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 30 September 2020 at 22,700 Kt (−1,400 /-5.8% y-o-y).

==Employees==
 the company had over 100,000 employees worldwide. After a financial struggle in 2020, and a loss of over €5.5 billion, ThyssenKrupp announced that it will be cutting over 11,000 jobs, 7,000 of which are located in Germany.

In November 2024, Thyssenkrupp announced it would lay off around 5,000 jobs at its steel subsidiary by 2030 and outsource a further 6,000 jobs.

==Products and sales==
ThyssenKrupp generates 33% of its consolidated sales in its home market. The rest of the European Union (EU) (28%) and the USMCA region (21%) are the key trading partners for business and exports outside Germany.

==Business areas==
The operations are organized in five business areas:
* Components technology
* Elevator technology
* Industrial machinery
* Materials services
* Steel

Construction of the corporate headquarters began in 2007. The first buildings were complete in 2010; the second phase of the building was completed in June 2015. Situated in the west of Essen, the corporate campus was designed by Chaix &amp; Morel et associeés (Paris) and JSWD Architekten (Cologne). Their design was selected for construction in an architectural design competition in 2006.

==Controversies==

===Price fixing===
In November 2006, five elevator manufacturers including ThyssenKrupp, were found guilty of price fixing by the EU, over nine years, along with competitors Otis Elevator Co., Schindler Group, Kone, and Mitsubishi Elevator Europe. On 21 February 2007, ThyssenKrupp was fined €479 million by the EU (Otis was fined $US295 million). The EU Competition Commission reported that the companies had worked to rig bids for procurement contracts, share markets, and fix prices between at least 1995 and 2004. The Commission reported that the companies &quot;did not contest the facts&quot; found by EU regulators, noting none of the accused requested a hearing to answer the allegations. The fines totaled US$1.3 billion.

In July 2012, the German Bundeskartellamt served fines totalling €124.5 million on ThyssenKrupp GfT Gleistechnik GmbH, Essen (€103m); Stahlberg Roensch GmbH, Seevetal, which since 2010 belongs to the Vossloh group (€13m); TSTG Schienen Technik GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Duisburg, a subsidiary of the Voestalpine group (€4.5m); and Voestalpine BWG GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Butzbach, another Voestalpine subsidiary (€4m) for price-fixing of steel railway lines and points blades supplied to Deutsche Bahn, the German state railway. According to Andreas Mundt, president of the Bundeskartellamt, &quot;For many years the rail suppliers have guaranteed each other virtually constant shares of Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s contract volume. The cartel members monitored compliance with the contract volume quotas, assigned each other projects, and set protective prices in order to steer the contract award process.&quot; The proceedings had been triggered by an application for leniency filed by the Austrian company Voestalpine AG. Investigations into further companies are ongoing.

===Turin plant fire and trial===
On the early morning of 6 December 2007, an accident on the annealing and pickling line of the ThyssenKrupp plant in Turin, Italy, caused the death of seven steelworkers. The accident happened between 00:45 and 00:48, when the eight workers that were then on duty attempted to extinguish a localized small pool fire with fire extinguishers and a fire hydrant, without success. About 400L of hydraulic oil escaped during the rupture of a hydraulic circuit which caused a violent jet fire engulfing the workers that were fighting the fire.

CEO Espenhahn was charged by the State prosecutor of Turin with &quot;voluntary multiple murder with possible malice&quot; (&quot;omicidio volontario multiplo con dolo eventuale&quot;), while five other managers and executives have been charged with &quot;culpable murder with conscious guilt&quot;. On Friday 15 April 2011, Espenhahn and all the other indictees were pronounced guilty of all charges; he was sentenced to 16 years and 6 months in jail and barred from holding public office for life. Prior to the court case, Espenhahn was transferred from Italy and is now believed to live in Brazil. On 23 February 2013, the Appellate Court changed the sentence for him to culpable murder, not recognizing the voluntary murder, thus reducing the conviction. Convictions for the other managers were also reduced.

In May 2016, the appeal court reduced the sentence for Espenhahn to 9 years and 8 months, the other 5 managers (4 Italians and 1 German) between 6 and 7 years. Priegnitz the German manager, was sentenced to 6 years and 3 months. According to the bilateral laws between Germany and Italy, the convicted can serve the term in his home country and with accordance to this countries&#x27; laws. Since accounts of first-degree murder have been appealed down to aggravated negligent manslaughter, the German convicts are expecting further reductions that would eventually not exceed 5 years.

====Bribery and conflict of interest====
ThyssenKrupp is suspected of corruption in deals made in Israel, Turkey, South Africa and also in Pakistan, where the deal did not mature. In Greece, the defense minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos was sentenced to prison for accepting a bribe from a consortium in which one of the members was ThyssenKrupp.

==Incidents==
ThyssenKrupp has been the target of major, organised hacking attacks on several occasions, attacking the company&#x27;s trade secrets.
On 8 December 2016, it was disclosed the company was attacked in February of that year. Internally uncovered in April 2016, it took their IT team around six months to fix. The hack is thought to have originated from South-East Asia and was successful in retrieving information from various departments, including the plant engineering division. In 2012, ThyssenKrupp and other European companies were attacked by Chinese hackers.

On August 15, 2024, a fire broke out at the Thyssenkrupp warehouse in Völklingen. The building where plastic products and solar panels were stored caught fire. Smoke from the burning warehouse was visible from Saarbrücken, 15 kilometers away. 200 firefighters fought the fire for more than 30 hours. The roof of the building collapsed.

<doc id="944222" wikidata="Q6607386" url="?curid=944222" title="List of battleships of Spain">
<text>In the latter half of the 19th century, the Spanish Navy had built a series of ironclad warships that culminated in the barbette ship &quot;Pelayo&quot; in the 1880s. Following the destruction of much of the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War in 1898, Spain slowly began to rebuild its navy. In the early 20th century, the Spanish Navy built three battleships and planned several more; the three ships that were completed were the vessels of the . These ships were the smallest dreadnought-type battleships ever built. A further three ships of the were authorized by the Navy Law of 1913, but the outbreak of World War I prevented these ships from being built, as Spain was heavily dependent on Great Britain for material and technical expertise. The three completed battleships all served in the Rif War in North Africa, where the lead ship, &quot;España&quot;, ran aground and was wrecked.

Following the end of the First World War, occasional plans for the construction of new battleships were proposed, including a small design deriving from Britain&#x27;s powerful s. However, nothing had come of these efforts by the time of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Following the victory of Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists in that conflict, in which both of the surviving Spanish battleships—one serving on the side of the Nationalists, the other on that of the Republicans—had been destroyed, proposals for the construction of four fast battleships to an Italian design, as well as the construction of &quot;large cruisers&quot;—the only battlecruiser designs proposed for or by Spain—were made. However, the outbreak of the Second World War resulted in these plans being disrupted.

==&quot;España&quot; class==
Authorized under the Navy Law of 1908 and assigned to the &quot;Primera Escuadra&quot; (First Squadron), the &quot;España&quot; class were the first and only Spanish dreadnoughts, and also the smallest of that type of ship ever to be built. Considered by some to be more &quot;Dreadnought-type coast-defense ships&quot; than pure battleships, the three ships of the class were built in Ferrol by &quot;Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval&quot; (SECN), the lead ship being completed in under four years, but the onset of World War I resulted in delays to the remaining two ships, and especially the third, as equipment and armament deliveries from England were disrupted due to the war.

Obsolete before completion due to the rapid progress of naval technology, the &quot;España&quot;s saw combat service in the Rif Wars and the Spanish Civil War, &quot;España&quot; being wrecked on the Moroccan coast in 1923, &quot;Alfonso XIII&quot; being renamed &quot;España&quot; following the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. In the mid-1930s, it was proposed that the two surviving ships of the class be rebuilt as &quot;pocket battleships&quot;, including a lengthening of the hull and rearranging of the turrets to a centerline alignment. By 1936, a more modest rebuild was proposed, including conversion to oil firing, but the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War put this plan to rest.

The remaining two ships of the class, one operating on each side, were both lost in the Spanish Civil War. &quot;España&quot; (ex-&quot;Alfonso XIII&quot;), serving the Nationalist side, struck a mine in April 1937 and sunk, while &quot;Jaime I&quot; fighting as part of the Republican navy, suffered an internal explosion at Cartagena in June 1937, being scuttled as a precautionary measure afterwards. The wreck was raised the following year before being scrapped in 1939.

==&quot;Reina Victoria Eugenia&quot; class==

Authorized as the &quot;Plan de la Segunda Escuadra&quot; under the Navy Law of 1913, the three ships of the &quot;Reina Victoria Eugenia&quot;-class, named for King Alfonso&#x27;s queen consort and designated ships &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; (only &quot;A&quot; having a formally proposed name), were designed by Vickers-Armstrongs and were planned to displace with a speed of . Early plans for the type called for an armament of guns, however financial difficulties resulted in the selection of an armament of eight weapons instead. As significant technical assistance from Britain would have been required for construction of the class, the outbreak of the First World War led to the cancellation of the project.

==Postwar projects==
Following the end of the First World War, Spain did not participate in the Washington Naval Conference which limited battleship construction for its signatories. Nevertheless, battleships of the displacement class—the limit under the Washington Naval Treaty—were considered by the Spanish Navy in the early 1920s. By the early 1930s, the navy made proposals for a &quot;reduced type&quot; ship, although nothing came of either project.

After his victory in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco made plans for the Spanish Navy that included the acquisition of four modern battleships, and a variation on the Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of technical support for the construction of ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy&#x27;s entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.

A &quot;super-Treaty cruiser&quot; type was also projected as part of Franco&#x27;s naval expansion plans, with some designs proposed for the type calling for an armament of six guns; alternatively, some have speculated that the Spanish desired to purchase the two triple turrets that were available following the decision by the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to rebuild the damaged battleship with twin turrets. The war situation meant that nothing was to come of this project either.

<text>The World Opponent Network (WON or WON.net) was an online video game service, originally developed by Sierra On-Line as the Sierra Internet Gaming System (SIGS). SIGS-based and WON-based servers operated from 1996 until 2008.

WON was used by games such as &quot;Homeworld&quot;, &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;Outpost 2&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot;, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Dark Reign 2&quot;, the free games &quot;Silencer&quot; and &quot;ARC&quot;, as well as the Hoyle series of casino, card and board games.

== Early development ==

SIGS began life as a prototype video game, &quot;Stock Market Challenge&quot;, in 1995. SIGS then moved onto beta testing integration into retail Sierra titles with &quot;Hoyle Blackjack&quot; in 1996. Before Christmas 1996, SIGS was built into 7 titles: &quot;Hoyle Blackjack&quot;, &quot;Hoyle Casino&quot;, &quot;Front Page Sports: Football Pro &#x27;97&quot;, &quot;Front Page Sports: Trophy Bass 2&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Power Chess&quot;, and &quot;The Time Warp of Dr. Brain&quot;.

== History ==
SIGS operated from late 1996 through November 1997 and was built into about 20 Sierra titles by this time. On November 18, 1997, after Sierra was acquired by CUC International, CUC announced that they will rebrand SIGS as WON as of December 1, 1997. On December 8, 1997, the open beta of the new WON website was launched. WON left beta and was officially launched on April 13, 1998.

In an apparent effort to boost WON awareness with off-the-shelf customers, Sierra released &quot;On-Line Games: Collection Series&quot; late in 1997 that contained 12 online titles (9 WON-enabled games, 2 WON.net browser-based games, plus &quot;The Realm&quot;).

WON touted its success when it announced 750,000 members on September 2, 1998. Just 6 months later in March 1999, WON claimed to have doubled their membership to 1.5 million, along with now attracting 1% of the WWW audience for February 1999, placing them in the top 500 websites and top 10 gaming sites.

WON attracted a few partnerships with significant third parties to become a multi-developer/multi-publisher service. On May 27, 1997, Sierra announced an agreement with Valve to publish and distribute &quot;Half-Life&quot;, which would bring it to WON when finally released in November 1998. On May 27, 1998, WON announced an agreement with GT Interactive and Epic MegaGames to bring &quot;Unreal&quot; to WON. On September 7, 1999, WON.net announced an agreement with Activision to bring a few of its multiplayer titles, including &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, to WON.net.

In August 1999, after Sierra was acquired by Havas, Havas made WON.net its own entity. In September 1999, WON.net announced plans to enter Europe. WON.net launched in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on February 17, 2000.

On March 29, 2000, Havas acquired PrizeCentral.com and merged it with WON.net, announced the creation of a new site to be called Flipside.com, and basically brought an end to the WON.net website as it was known. Regardless, WON.net continued on in various forms (primarily for WON-enabled games minus the Hoyle titles) including becoming action.WON.net for a period. Even as main pages continued to shift for WON-enabled games, many of the WON multiplayer servers continued to runeven adding a few new titles. The last WON-enabled title launched (not multiplayer but has an online element to it) was &quot;Caesar IV&quot; in September 2006.

Meanwhile, in 2001, Valve (which had a publishing and distribution agreement with Sierra) was secretly working on their own competing service, Steam. Sierra and Vivendi Universal (the current owner of Sierra and WON.net) did not learn of this until March 2002 when Valve announced Steam&#x27;s beta release at GDC 2002. This only added to the current rift between Sierra and Valve. Shortly after the release of Steam beta, all of Valve&#x27;s WON-enabled titles (&quot;Half-Life&quot; and its mods) were patched to run on Steam instead. Valve shut down the last of its WON servers on July 31, 2004.

Also in 2001, Raven Software took their popular title, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, off of WON.net and over to GameSpy instead.

Many of Sierra&#x27;s long-running titles were shut down on August 16, 2007. The last of Sierra&#x27;s and Activision&#x27;s WON servers (now in the hands of Activision and Vivendi Games) were shut down on November 1, 2008.

== Legacy ==
While some of the WON-enabled titles moved to other online platforms after WON (see the list of WON-enabled games below), most of the 100 or so titles (depending on how you count expansions and Hoyle titles) have been offline since their official WON servers were shut down. A few independent efforts, however, have been made to bring some of the abandoned titles back online.

=== WON2 ===
WON2 (formerly No-WON and PlanetWON2.com) is a non-commercial but closed-source project started by the Steamless CS Project Team in 2003. WON2 supports, primarily, pre-Steam versions of &quot;Half-Life&quot; and its mods. WON2 was born out of a dislike for how games were running on Steam versus WON. Even though the project began with a &quot;Steamless&quot; port of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; 1.6, it appears to have lasted this long because Steam forces &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; players to run version 1.6 when many fans felt that version 1.5 was better. For example, of the 60 current servers online (April 2023), 56 of them are running &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; 1.5 (3 running &quot;Half-Life&quot; and 1 running &quot;Team Fortress&quot;).

While WON2 has a stated goal of also &quot;focusing on other former WON games&quot; (besides &quot;Half-Life&quot;) the only other game known to have received some attention by the project team is &quot;Silencer&quot;, but it was never launched. WON2 claims to have reached its peak popularity between 2005 and 2010 with more than 1,000 servers and up to 10,000 players at a time. As of April 2023, WON2 is still operational with around 400 hundred players during peak hours, and the majority of the servers hosted in China. While most of the WON2 and Steamless CS Project websites are still active, the forum for the project has been down since at least August 2016.

A side project to WON2 is called &quot;Counter-Strike Beta 6.1&quot; which uses WON2 assets to run even earlier versions of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. As of April 2023, 11 servers for beta 6.1 and 1 server for beta 5.2 were online.

=== NeuWon and NuWON ===
NuWON.Net (formerly NeuWon.com, 2014-2018) was another non-commercial but closed-source project meant to revive WON multiplayer gaming. The goal of NuWON was to support all former WON titles and not just the &quot;Half-Life&quot; family. In 2014, NeuWon sprung from a 2012 WON project on Google Code by a member of same team that created WON2, the Steamless CS Project Team. NeuWon officially launched on March 13, 2016. By May 2021, NuWON had listed 21 supported games (not counting &quot;Half-Life&quot; mods) plus an additional 8 that needed testing. The last news post from NuWON&#x27;s developer was in December 2021 (regarding working on a move to Linux) and the site disappeared in 2022.

=== NeoEE ===
NeoEE sprung from the same 2012 WON project on Google Code that NeuWon did. NeoEE released a server with a fully-working lobby in 2013. NeoEE supports &quot;Empire Earth&quot; and its expansion, &quot;The Art of Conquest&quot; (AOC).

<doc id="944227" wikidata="Q724323" url="?curid=944227" title="Yulian Semyonov">
<text>Yulian Semyonovich Semyonov (, ), pen-name of Yulian Semyonovich Lyandres () (October 8, 1931 – September 15, 1993), was a Soviet and Russian writer of spy fiction and detective fiction, also scriptwriter and poet. He is well known for creating the fictional spy Stierlitz.

==Early life==

Semyonov&#x27;s father was Jewish, the editor of the newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot;, Semyon Alexandrovich Lyandres. His mother was Russian, Galina Nikolaevna Nozdrina, a history teacher.

In 1953 Semyonov graduated from the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies Middle-East department. He then taught the Afghan language (Pashto) at Moscow State University and simultaneously studied there in the faculty of history.

==Career==
After gaining an interpreter&#x27;s degree at the university, Semyonov had diplomatic business in East Asian countries, continuing at the same time his scientific studies at Moscow State University (specializing in Persian history and politics).

Since 1955 he started to try his hand at journalism: he was published in key Soviet newspapers and magazines of that time: &quot;Ogoniok&quot;, &quot;Pravda&quot;, &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;, &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot;, &quot;Smena&quot; etc.

In the 1960s–1970s Semyonov worked abroad a lot as a reporter of the said editions (in France, Spain, Germany, Cuba, Japan, the US, Latin America). His journalistic career was full of adventures, often dangerous ones – at one time he was in the taiga with tiger hunters, then at a polar station, and then at the Baikal-Amur Mainline construction and diamond pipe opening. He was constantly at the center of important political events of those years – in Afghanistan, Francoist Spain, Chile, Cuba, Paraguay, tracing Nazis who sought cover from punishment, and Sicilian mafia leaders; taking part in the combatant operations of the Vietnamese and Laotian partisans.

Semyonov was one of the pioneers of Investigative journalism in Soviet periodicals. In 1974 in Madrid he managed to interview a Nazi criminal, Hitler&#x27;s favorite Otto Skorzeny, who had categorically refused to meet any journalist before. Then, being the &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot; newspaper correspondent in Germany, the writer succeeded in interviewing the reichsminister Albert Speer and one of the SS leaders Karl Wolff.

His interviews, as well as his investigations regarding the searches for the Amber Room and other cultural treasures moved abroad from Russia during World War II, were published by Semyonov in his documentary story &quot;Face to Face&quot; in 1983.
=== Social activity ===
* In 1986, Semyonov became the President of the International Association of Detective and Political Novel (Russian: МАДПР), which he himself initiated to create, and the editor-in-chief of the collected stories edition &quot;Detective and Politics&quot; (the edition was published by the said Association together with the Press Agency &quot;Novosti&quot; and played an important role in popularization of the detective genre in the USSR.)
* Semyonov&#x27;s participation in searching for the famous Amber Room together with Georges Simenon, James Aldridge, baron von Falz-Fein and other famous members of the International Amber Room Searching Committee achieved wide renown.

* Semyonov, together with Baron Eduard von Falz-Fein, a Russian aristocrat and first wave émigré, was engaged in searching for and returning the lost cultural treasures to Russia. The activity of the International Committee for Returning Russian Treasures to the Motherland established by Semyonov made it possible to return to Russia the Feodor Ivanovich Chaliapin&#x27;s remains, the part of Lifar&amp;Diaghilev&#x27;s library, the unique tapestry from the Livadia Palace depicting the Royal Family and many other cultural values.
* With the beginning of the perestroika Semyonov got the chance to cover the pages of the Soviet history which used to be a forbidden subject before. In 1988 there appeared the essay collection &quot;Closed History Pages&quot; and &quot;Unwritten Novels&quot;, the philippic narrative about the times and morals of Stalin&#x27;s cult of personality based on the historical documents, eyewitnesses&#x27; accounts and the author&#x27;s personal experience.
* In 1989 Semyonov founded the first private (i.e. uncontrolled by the government) Soviet edition – the &quot;Top Secret&quot; bulletin (&quot;Sovershenno sekretno&quot;), then becoming its editor-in-chief with the symbolic royalty of 1 rouble per year.
* In 1988 Yulian Semyonov, Vasily Livanov and Vitaly Solomin opened the experimental Moscow theatre &quot;Detective&quot;. There were staged thrilling plays and children&#x27;s performances. In 1992, Y.S. Semyonov being already seriously ill, the company was directed by Livanov and the unique theatre was closed due to the ownership conflict.

==Personal life==

His wife Ekaterina Sergeevna was a step-daughter of Sergey Vladimirovich Mikhalkov (the wedding took place on 12 April 1955). Though their family life was quite complicated, Ekaterina Sergeevna devotedly kept looking after her husband after the stroke which happened to him in 1990. They had two daughters – Daria and Olga. The elder one, Daria, is an artist, and the younger, Olga Semyonova, is a journalist and a writer, an author of the autobiographical books about her father.

After the sudden stroke in 1990, Semyonov became bedridden and could not return to work ever again. Y.S. Semyonov died on 15 September 1993 in Moscow. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. The writer&#x27;s disease and death are controversial, due to a possibility of him being assassinated.

According to investigative journalist Vladimir Solovyov, Semyonov was actually poisoned by the KGB to prevent him from publishing the materials about Moscow Patriarch Alexius&#x27;s II and other Russian Orthodox Church officials&#x27; collaboration with the KGB. Soloviev referred to information provided by Artyom Borovik. The material (a video tape) was allegedly prepared by priest Alexander Men, who was killed by unknown assassins at the same time. The materials were published later by Gleb Yakunin, who was given access to KGB files as a member of the Lev Ponomaryov commission.

==Legacy==

<text>Plymouth is a small rural community in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is located approximately 3 km south of the town of New Glasgow. It stretches along Route 348 situated on the east bank of the East River of Pictou, opposite the town of Stellarton.

Now largely dominated by mixed farming and near-urban sprawl, Plymouth is home to the site of the Westray Mine. A methane gas explosion in the mine on May 9, 1992, which killed 26 miners, placed Plymouth in the international media spotlight for almost a week during the failed rescue efforts, with the local community centre, opposite the mine site, becoming a symbol of the area.

The name came from the Loyalists who came here from Shelburne in 1758.

<doc id="944240" wikidata="Q22084735" url="?curid=944240" title="Aktiengesellschaft">
<text> (; abbreviated AG ) is a German word for a corporation limited by share ownership (i.e., one which is owned by its shareholders) whose shares may be traded on a stock market. The term is used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland (where it is equivalent to a &quot;société anonyme&quot; or a &quot;società per azioni&quot;) and South Tyrol for companies incorporated there. In the United Kingdom, the equivalent term is public limited company, and in the United States, while the terms &quot;incorporated&quot; or &quot;corporation&quot; are typically used, technically the more precise equivalent term is &quot;joint-stock company&quot;.

==Meaning of the word==
The German word &quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot; is a compound noun made up of two elements: &quot;Aktien&quot; meaning an acting part or share, and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;, meaning company or society. English translations include &quot;share company&quot;, or &quot;company limited by shares&quot;, or joint-stock company. In German, the use of the term &quot;Aktien&quot; for shares is restricted to &quot;Aktiengesellschaften&quot;. Shares in other types of German companies (e.g., GmbH or a cooperative) are called &quot;Anteile&quot; (parts-of) rather than &quot;Aktien&quot;.

==Legal basis==
In Germany and Austria, the legal basis of the AG is the German &quot;Aktiengesetz&quot; (abbr. AktG; &quot;shares law&quot;) or the Austrian &quot;Aktiengesetz&quot; (abbr. AktG). Since the German commercial law (§ 19 &quot;Handelsgesetzbuch&quot;) requires all corporations to specify their legal form in their name, in order to inform the public of the limits on their liability, all German (required by § 4 &quot;Aktiengesetz&quot;) and Austrian stock corporations include &quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot; or &quot;AG&quot; as part of their name, frequently as a suffix.

In Switzerland, the Company Limited by Shares (&quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot; in German, &quot;société anonyme&quot; in French, &quot;società anonima&quot; in Italian, &quot;societad anonima&quot; in Romansh) is defined in Title Twenty-Six of the Code of Obligations, Article 620. Article 950 specifies that the business name must indicate the legal form.

==Structure==
German AGs have a &quot;two-tiered board&quot; structure, consisting of a supervisory board (&quot;Aufsichtsrat&quot;) and a management board (&quot;Vorstand&quot;). The supervisory board is generally controlled by shareholders, although employees may have seats, depending on the size of the company. The management board directly runs the company, but its members may be removed by the supervisory board, which also determines the management board&#x27;s compensation. Some German AGs have management boards which determine their own remuneration, but that situation is now relatively uncommon.

The general meeting is the supreme governing body of a Swiss company limited by shares. It elects the board of directors (&quot;Verwaltungsrat&quot; in German) and the external auditors. The board of directors may appoint and dismiss persons entrusted with managing and representing the company.

==Similar forms==

<text>The Melbourne rail network is a metropolitan suburban and freight rail system serving the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The metropolitan rail network is centred around the Melbourne central business district (CBD) and consists of 221 railway stations across 16 lines, which served a patronage of 182.5 million over the year 2023–2024. It is the core of the larger Victorian railway network, with regional links to both intrastate and interstate rail systems.

Metro Trains Melbourne operates the Melbourne metropolitan rail network under franchise from the Victorian Government, overseen by Public Transport Victoria, a division of the Department of Transport and Planning. The government-owned entity V/Line operates trains from Melbourne across regional Victoria. The first steam train in Australia commenced service in Melbourne in 1854 between Flinders Street and Sandridge, with the metropolitan rail network having grown over the last two centuries to cover much of the city and greater Melbourne area.

The metropolitan network is a suburban rail system designed to transport passengers from Melbourne&#x27;s suburbs into the Melbourne central business district (CBD) and associated city loop stations, with the main hub at Flinders Street station. Southern Cross station is the main interchange station between metropolitan and regional V/Line services. A new underground line is currently under construction as part of the Metro Tunnel project, which aims to increase network capacity and provide Melbourne with a turn-up-and-go metro-like service. A major new orbital line is also under construction and would be the network&#x27;s first autonomous line.

A total length of of track is owned by VicTrack and leased to train operators through Public Transport Victoria. The railway network is primarily at ground level, with some underground and elevated sections. There were more than 170 level crossings before the Level Crossing Removal Project commenced in 2015 to grade separate 110 of the busiest crossings and rebuild 51 railway stations, with 67 crossings removed by December 2022. The metropolitan network operates primarily between 5:00 a.m. and midnight, with overnight services on Friday night to Saturday morning and Saturday night to Sunday morning, departing from Flinders Street only. Some tracks are also used by freight trains and V/Line regional services.

In addition to the primary commuter and freight railway networks, Melbourne also features heritage railways such as Puffing Billy and has the world&#x27;s largest urban tram network.

== History ==
=== First railway ===
On 7 September 1851, a public meeting called for the construction of Australia&#x27;s first railway to link Melbourne and Sandridge (now known as Port Melbourne), which led to the establishment of the privately owned Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company in 1853.

On 8 February 1853, the Government also approved the establishment of the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company and the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company. Work began in March 1853 on the Sandridge railway line, stretching from the Melbourne (or City) terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station) to Sandridge. The line was owned and operated by Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company, opening in 1854.

In 1855, the Government conducted enquiries and carried out surveys into country railways. On 1 April 1856, the Railway Department was established as part of the Board of Land and Works with George Christian Darbyshire being appointed Engineer in Chief. On 23 May of that year the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company was taken over by the Government.

Trains were ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company of the United Kingdom. The first train was locally built by Robertson, Martin &amp; Smith, however, owing to delays in shipping. Australia&#x27;s first steam locomotive was built in ten weeks and cost £2,700. Forming the first steam train to travel in Australia, it made its maiden trip on 12 September 1854.

The opening of the line occurred during the period of the Victorian gold rush—a time when both Melbourne and Victoria undertook massive capital works, each with its gala opening. The inaugural journey on the Sandridge line was no exception. According to the Argus newspaper&#x27;s report of the next day: &quot;Long before the hour appointed . . . a great crowd assembled round the station at the Melbourne terminus, lining the whole of Flinders Street&quot;. Lieutenant-Governor Sir Charles Hotham and Lady Hotham were aboard the train—which consisted of two first-class carriages and one-second class—and were presented with satin copies of the railway&#x27;s timetable and bylaws.

The trip took 10 minutes, none of the later stations along the line having been built. On arriving at Station Pier (onto which the tracks extended), it was hailed with gun salutes by the warships HMS &quot;Electra&quot; and HMS &quot;Fantome&quot;.

By March 1855, the four engines ordered from the UK were all in service, with trains running every half-hour. They were named &quot;Melbourne&quot;, &quot;Sandridge&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot;, and &quot;Yarra&quot; (after the Yarra River over which the line crossed).

=== Early private companies ===

The Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company opened Melbourne&#x27;s second railway on 13 May 1857, a line from the Melbourne (or City) Terminus to St Kilda. The line was later extended by the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company, which opened a line from St Kilda to Brighton in 1857.

The first country line opened in 1857 when the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company started services on its line from Geelong to Newport. In 1859, the government-owned Victorian Railways Williamstown line opened, connecting Williamstown and Geelong to Spencer Street station.

More country lines followed in 1859 when the Victorian Railways opened a line from Footscray, on the Williamstown line, to Sunbury. The Victorian Railways had taken over construction from the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company, established in 1853 to build a railway to Echuca, but which had failed to make any progress.

The first line to Melbourne&#x27;s south-eastern suburbs was opened in 1859 by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, running from Princes Bridge railway station to Punt Road (Richmond), South Yarra, and Prahran. That line was extended to Windsor in 1860, connecting with the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company line from St Kilda. The new line replaced the indirect St Kilda and Windsor line to the city, which was closed in 1867.

Another suburban line was built by the Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company in 1860, running from North Melbourne to Essendon, with a branch line from Newmarket to Flemington Racecourse, which opened in 1861. On the eastern side of the city, the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company opened a branch line from Richmond to Burnley and Hawthorn in 1861.

By that point, the railways of Melbourne were a disjointed group of city-centric lines, with various companies operating from three unconnected city terminals—Princes Bridge, Flinders Street, and Spencer Street stations.

The smaller companies quickly encountered financial problems. The St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company and Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company were absorbed by the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company in 1865, forming the Melbourne and Hobsons Bay United Railway Company. The Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company was taken over by the Victorian Government in 1867. The Melbourne and Hobsons Bay United Railway Company was not taken over by the Victorian Government until 1878.

The terminals themselves were linked in 1879, when the track was built at street level along the southern side of Flinders Street, connecting with Spencer Street station, although the track was only used at night, for freight traffic. It was not until 1889 that the two-track Flinders Street Viaduct was built between the two city terminus stations.

The outward expansion also continued, with major trunk lines being opened in rural Victoria. The Victorian Railways extended its line to Broadmeadows in 1872, as part of the line to Seymour and Albury-Wodonga. In 1879, the Gippsland line was opened from South Yarra to Caulfield, Pakenham and Bairnsdale.

=== Land boom lines ===

The 1870s and 1880s were a time of great growth and prosperity in Melbourne. Land speculation companies were formed, to buy up outer suburban land cheaply, and to agitate for suburban railways to be built or extended to serve those land holdings and increase land values. By 1880, the &quot;Land Boom&quot; was in full swing in Victoria, re-elected in the passing of the Railway Construction Act 1884, later known as the &quot;Octopus Act&quot;, which authorised the building of 66 railway lines throughout the state.

The Frankston line began with the opening of a line from Caulfield to Mordialloc in 1881, reaching the terminus in 1882. A second new suburban railway line was opened from Spencer Street Station to Coburg in 1884, and extended to Somerton in 1889, meeting the main line from Spencer Street to Wodonga. Land developers opened a private railway from Newport to Altona in 1888, but it was closed in 1890, due to lack of demand.

The line from Hawthorn was extended, to Camberwell in 1882, Lilydale in 1883, and Healesville in 1889. In addition, a branch line (now known as the Belgrave line) was opened from Ringwood to Upper Ferntree Gully in 1889. A short branch two station was also opened from Hawthorn to Kew in 1887. The Brighton Beach line was also extended to Sandringham in 1887.

In 1888, railways came to the northeastern suburbs with the opening of the Inner Circle line from Spencer Street station via Royal Park station to what is now Victoria Park station, and then on to Heidelberg. A branch was also opened off the Inner Circle in Fitzroy North, to Epping and Whittlesea in 1888 and 1889. Trains between Spencer Street and Heidelberg reversed at Victoria Park until a link was opened between Victoria Park and Princes Bridge in 1901.

The Outer Circle line opened in 1890, linking Oakleigh (on the Gippsland line) to Riversdale (with a branch to Camberwell on the Lilydale line) and Fairfield (on the Heidelberg line). Originally envisaged to link the Gippsland line with Spencer Street station in the 1870s, this reason disappeared with the building of a direct link via South Yarra before the line had even opened. The line saw little traffic as it traversed empty paddocks, and with no through traffic, the Outer Circle was closed in sections between 1893 and 1897. The Camberwell to Ashburton stretch of the Outer Circle re-opened in 1899, and then in 1900, part of the northern section of the Outer Circle reopened as a shuttle service between East Camberwell and Deepdene station. This line closed in 1927.

At the same time as the Outer Circle, a railway was opened from Burnley to Darling and a junction with the Outer Circle at Waverley Road (near the current East Malvern station). A stub of the future Glen Waverley line, it was cut back to Darling in 1895.

Railway building during the land boom hit a peak with the construction of the Rosstown Railway between Elsternwick and Oakleigh. Built by William Murry Ross, the line was planned in the 1870s to serve a sugar beet mill near Caulfield. Construction commenced in 1883, followed by rebuilding in 1888. Ross&#x27;s debts grew, and he attempted to sell the line many times without success. It never opened to traffic and was later dismantled.

The stock market crash of early 1890s led to an extended period of economic depression in Victoria and put an end to most railway construction until the next decade.

By the 1900s, the driving force for new railway lines was agriculturalists in what are now Melbourne&#x27;s outer suburbs. In the Dandenong Ranges a narrow gauge 762 mm line was opened from Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave and Gembrook in 1900 to serve the local farming and timber community. In the Yarra Valley, a branch was opened from Lilydale to Yarra Junction and Warburton in 1901. Part of this line is now listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

In 1901, in preparation for the occasion of a royal visit by the Duke of York, the first Australian royal train was assembled in Melbourne.

The Heidelberg line was extended to Eltham in 1902 and Hurstbridge in 1912. The freight-only Mont Park line was also opened in 1911, branching from Macleod. Finally, on the Mornington Peninsula, a branch was built from Bittern to Red Hill in 1921.

=== Electrification ===

Planning for electrification was started by Victorian Railways chairman Thomas James Tait, who engaged English engineer Charles Hesterman Merz to deliver a report on the electrification of the Melbourne suburban network. His first report in 1908 recommended a three-stage plan over two years, covering 200 route-kilometres existing lines and almost 500 suburban carriages (approximately 80 trains). The report was considered by the Government and the Railway Commissioners, and Merz was engaged to deliver a second report based on their feedback.

Delivered in 1912, this second report recommended an expanded system of electrification to 240 route km. of existing lines (463 track km), and almost 800 suburban carriages (approximately 130 trains). The works were approved by the State Government in December 1912. It was envisaged that the first electric trains would be running by 1915, and the project would be completed by 1917. However, progress fell behind because World War I restrictions prevented electrical equipment from being imported from the United Kingdom.

Rolling stock construction continued, with several older suburban carriages converted for electric use as the Swing Door trains, while the first of the Tait trains were introduced as steam-hauled carriages. Track expansion was also carried out, with four tracks being provided between South Yarra and Caulfield, as well as grade separation from roads. Victorian Railways in 1918 opened the Newport Power Station, the largest power station in the urban area, to supply electricity as part of the electrification project. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria was formed in 1921 but did not take over Newport A power station until 1951.

The first trials did not occur until October 1918 on the Flemington Racecourse line. Driver training continued on this line until 18 May 1919, when the first electric train ran between Sandringham and Essendon, simulating revenue services. Electric services started on 28 May 1919 with the first train running to Essendon, then on to Sandringham, with full services starting the next day. The Burnley–Darling line, the Fawkner line, the reopened branch to Altona, and the Williamstown line followed in 1920.

The line to Broadmeadows, the Whittlesea line to Reservoir, the Bendigo line to St Albans, and the inner sections of the Hurstbridge line was electrified in 1921. The Gippsland line to Dandenong and Frankston line were electrified in 1922, as was the inner section of the Ringwood line due to regrading works.

The original electrification scheme was completed in 1923, but over the next three years, several short extensions were carried out. The Ashburton line was electrified in 1924, and final works on the Lilydale line were completed in 1925, as was electrification on the line to Upper Ferntree Gully. Electrification on the outer ends of the Hurstbridge line was completed by 1926, the Whittlesea line to Thomastown was electrified in 1929, and the Burnley – Darling line was extended to Glen Waverley in 1930 to become the Glen Waverley line.

===Post-War rebuilding===
Railways experienced increased patronage into the 1940s, but railway improvements recommended in the Ashworth Improvement Plan were delayed until after World War II. It was not until 1950 that the Victorian Railways were able to put their Operation Phoenix rebuilding plan into action. The delivery of the Harris trains, the first steel suburban trains on the network, enabled the retirement of the oldest of the Swing Door trains.

Railway lines were extended during this period to encompass Melbourne&#x27;s growing suburbia. The Ashburton line was extended along the old Outer Circle track formation to Alamein station in 1948. The Fawkner line to Upfield and the Reservoir line to Lalor were both electrified in 1959, the Epping line reaching Epping in 1964. A great deal of track amplification was also undertaken, with several single-line sections eliminated.

The Upper Ferntree Gully to Belgrave section of the Gembrook narrow gauge line was converted to broad gauge and electrified in 1962. The remainder of the line was closed in 1954 but has been progressively reopened by the Puffing Billy Railway. The Gippsland line was electrified in 1954 as part of the works being carried out on the line, but suburban services to Pakenham did not start until 1975.

During this rebuilding, several little-used lines were closed on the edges of Melbourne. The Bittern to Red Hill line closed in 1953, the line between Lalaor and Whittlesea closed in 1959, and the Lilydale to Warburton line closed in 1964. The final stages of the rebuilding stretched into the 1970s, with track amplification carried out to Footscray, and Box Hill, and the first deliveries of the stainless steel Hitachi trains.

Detailed planning for the Doncaster line also commenced in that period and, by 1972, the route was finalised. Despite rising costs, state governments of the period continued to give assurances that the line would be built but, by 1984, land reserved for the line had been sold.

=== Modernisation ===

By the 1970s, Melbourne&#x27;s railway network was run down, with the last major investment on the suburban tracks having taken place nearly fifty years earlier. Sixty-year-old Tait trains (known colloquially as &quot;red rattlers&quot;) were still in operation, and inner city congestion at Flinders Street led to peak hour delays. In February 1971, the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Act was passed, establishing the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority (MURLA) to build a connecting series of tunnels from the major stations along the north, south, east and west extremities of the Melbourne CBD. The project ran for over 14 years, opening progressively between 1981 and 1985. The loop was designed and constructed to improve the capacity of Flinders Street and Spencer Street stations to handle suburban trains and to offer easier connections for users.

Other major changes took place in 1976 when the government authority overseeing Victorian Railways became VicRail and was gradually restructured along corporate lines. Following the restructure, in 1980 the Victorian Transport Study, better known as the Lonie Report, was delivered and called for financial rationalisation. The closure of the Port Melbourne, St. Kilda, Altona, Williamstown, Alamein and Sandringham lines was also recommended, along with their replacement with bus routes instead. These recommendations and cuts were not enacted, however many uneconomical branch lines were closed throughout the rest of the state. The line between Lilydale and Healesville was closed in 1980, now used by the Yarra Valley Railway beyond Yarra Glen. The branch from Baxter to Mornington was closed in 1981, but the line south of Moorooduc is now operated by the Mornington Railway as a tourist route.

The Metrol train control centre was opened in 1980 to coordinate trains throughout the network using computer software that remains in use today. Public transport in Melbourne was also reorganised, with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) formed in 1983 to coordinate all train, tram and bus services in the city to improve interoperability. With the electrification of the Werribee line in 1983, followed two years later by an extension of the Altona line to Laverton, and the City Loop in full operation by 1985, the last major modernisation of Melbourne&#x27;s train lines in the 20th century was complete.

Isolated from the City Loop, the Port Melbourne and St Kilda lines were converted to standard gauge light rail in 1987 to accommodate tram routes 111 (now Route 109) and 96. Route 96 remains one of the world&#x27;s top 10 tram routes and Melbourne&#x27;s busiest.


The early 1990s saw further changes, with the MTA reborn as the Public Transport Corporation, trading as &quot;The Met&quot;.

State governments of both sides of politics began to push for reform of the railway network, proposing the conversion of the Upfield, Williamstown and Alamein lines to light rail. Those proposals were not proceeded with, and the Upfield line received a series of upgrades to replace labour-intensive manual signalling systems. Federal government funding was made available for the electrification of the South Gippsland line, which was completed in 1995. Rationalisation of the Jolimont rail yard commenced, enabling the creation and expansion of Melbourne Park in 1988 and 1996, and the future construction of Federation Square in 2001.

After the election of the Kennett government in 1992, several controversial reforms to the operation of the railway system were initiated. Guards were removed from suburban trains and train drivers took over the task of door operation. Stations were de-staffed, and the Metcard ticketing system was introduced to replace the scratch-card system. Over that period more than $250 million in operating costs were stripped from the Melbourne network, as the government sought to reign in the state debt of $32 billion.

===Privatisation===
In 1998, &quot;The Met&quot; was split into two operating units—Hillside Trains and Bayside Trains―each franchised to a different private operator. Ownership of land and infrastructure of rail and tram services was transferred to a new Victorian Government agency, VicTrack. In addition, a statutory office was created in Government—the Director of Public Transport—with specific responsibility for entering into franchise agreements with public transport operators to operate rail and tram services throughout Victoria. By 1999, the privatisation process was complete, with Connex Melbourne and M&gt;Train operating half of the network. In 2003, the parent company of M&gt;Train (National Express) withdrew from operating public transport in Victoria, and half of the suburban network was transferred to Connex as part of a renegotiated contract.

The franchising contracts contained provisions for the new operators to refurbish the Comeng trains, and to replace the older Hitachi trains. Connex purchased Alstom X&#x27;Trapolis sets, while M&gt;Train chose Siemens Nexas units.

In May 2005, the State Government commissioned a A$25 million study into the feasibility of a third track for the Dandenong line to increase capacity for the rapidly growing suburban area. The cost of the triplication process was expected to be as high as A$1 billion, as project activities would have included the organization of corresponding bus services for the rail line, changes to stations and platforms along the line, and the improvement of the signalling system. This project was ultimately sidelined and not delivered by the Brumby Government.

In 2006, Professor Paul Mees and a group of academics estimated that privatisation had cost taxpayers $1.2 billion more than if the system had remained both publicly owned and operated. With the franchise extensions in 2009, taxpayers were to pay an estimated $2.1 billion more by 2010. However, the Institute of Public Affairs released its report on Melbourne&#x27;s privatisation, which assessed it as a modest success and observed that a 37.6% increase in patronage on the metropolitan rail system had reversed years of patronage decline due to poor quality services. The Auditor General of Victoria also performed a comprehensive audit report into the franchises and found that &quot;the franchises represent reasonable value for money&quot;.

=== Ridership boom and Metro Trains Melbourne ===
Beginning in the mid-2000s, a rapid increase in patronage of Melbourne&#x27;s train network occurred. In the three years between the financial year 2005 and 2008, rail patronage grew by 35 per cent. Trips grew from 148 million in 2004 to more than 200 million in 2008.

In November 2007, Singapore&#x27;s SMRT Transit and Hong Kong&#x27;s MTR Corporation Limited expressed interest in taking control of Melbourne&#x27;s suburban rail network from Connex in November 2009, when their contract was to be reviewed.

On 25 June 2009, Connex lost its bid to renew its contract with the Victorian Government. Hong Kong backed and owned MTR Corporation took over the Melbourne train network on 30 November 2009, operating as a locally themed consortium Metro Trains Melbourne. MTR is a non-public railway owner and operator in Hong Kong where it is well known for constructing Transit Oriented Developments (TODS) above and around its stations. Metro began operation on 1 December 2009, promising to draw on its international experience to improve Melbourne&#x27;s rail operations.

Transport minister Lynne Kosky stated that the Government&#x27;s A$10.5 billion, 10-year major transport plan, announced in May 2006, had significantly underestimated the usage rates of public transport. Original assessments had forecast increases of around 3–4%, far short of the 10% seen year-on-year. The State Government responded by purchasing new trains and introducing a new ticketing option that enabled commuters to pay a reduced fare if their journey finished by 7 am.

In 2008, the Brumby Government announced a $14.1 billion Victorian Transport Plan to augment Melbourne&#x27;s rail network. The plan included:

* The Metro Tunnel, costing more than $4.5 billion, consists of an underground train network —the first new underground rail line since the construction of the City Loop 25 years earlier— from Dynon to South Yarra. Aimed at &quot;relieving overcrowding on the busy suburban lines from Melbourne’s west,&quot; the underground line was also designed to provide direct rail access to Melbourne University, the Women&#x27;s Hospital and the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital. 
* Rolling stock, $2.65 billion for up to 70 new trains, including 32 High Capacity Metro Trains.
* Rail extensions to Cranbourne East and Mernda, and electrification to Melton.
* Improvements to train operations, for $200 million.
* Upgrades to metro stations, costing $50 million, and new stations in growth areas for $220 million.
* A Park &amp; Ride expansion package costing $60 million.
*The previously reduced Early Bird ticket was also made free as part of these changes, following a trial on the Frankston and Sydenham lines.

Following the investment announcement, the plan for the introduction of more than 200 new weekly train services was released to tackle overcrowding on the city&#x27;s busiest train lines, a problem that had been attributed to a lack of trains and falling reliability.

On 1 May 2009, the State Government announced that they had committed $562.3 million in the 2009 State Budget for the extension of the Epping line 3.5 kilometres north to South Morang. Construction started in 2010 and was completed in 2012.

=== Network development and level-crossing removals ===
In May 2011, operations commenced on a new metropolitan timetable, rewritten for the first time since 1996 with over 600 additional weekday services added. In 2012, a Public Transport Development Authority trading as Public Transport Victoria (PTV) was established to coordinate, plan and regulate the state&#x27;s public transport services, including the metropolitan rail system. In the same year, the Metcard ticketing system was discontinued, completing the controversial network-wide roll-out of the new Myki smart card system. On 27 March 2013, Public Transport Victoria published its Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail, detailing a 4-stage plan spread over 20 years to redevelop Melbourne&#x27;s rail system into a &quot;metro-style&quot; network, by separating train lines and creating point-to-point lines, upgrading to high-capacity signalling and ordering new trains.

A key campaign promise of the Andrews government before its election in 2014 was to remove 50 level crossings in eight years, the most intensive such program in Melbourne&#x27;s history. Because of Melbourne&#x27;s generally level topography, the suburban rail network was constructed with a large number of level crossings. By 2014, over 170 remained, due to a lack of funding for grade separations after 1918. The Government&#x27;s Level Crossing Removal Project became a resounding political success, despite concerns it was creating poor value-for-money infrastructure and controversy about the selection of elevated rail as a method for removing some crossings.

By 2018, 29 level crossings had been fully grade-separated, well ahead of the government&#x27;s original schedule, and a further 25 crossings were added to the program to be completed by 2025. The project includes rebuilding or upgrading 27 train stations, such as Bentleigh and Clayton railway stations, or laying new tracks, such as the duplication of of single-track railway between Heidelberg and the rebuilt Rosanna stations. Large sections of elevated rail have been built on the Gippsland line, and further sections are planned for the Mernda and Upfield lines, including a section on the Mernda line in Preston.

In mid-2015, the Regional Rail Link project was completed. It created a new Deer Park–West Werribee railway line in the city&#x27;s west, with stations at Wyndham Vale and Tarneit, as well as adding a pair of non-electrified tracks between Sunshine and Southern Cross for regional trains. Although the project was intended to provide routes for regional trains to Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo segregated from electrified Metro services, rapid population growth in areas served by the new line meant that V/Line trains had to perform the role of an outer suburban service, causing significant delays and overcrowding.

A redesigned network map was released by PTV at the end of 2016, which replaced an emphasis on fare zones with a delineation of individual lines and service patterns. The new map also incorporated regional services and was designed to be accessible to passengers with the most common types of colour blindness.

Metro&#x27;s contract to operate the suburban network was renewed in 2017 for a further seven years. The renegotiated contracts included higher monthly performance targets, which Metro failed to meet six times in the first year of the contract&#x27;s operation.

Construction of an extension of the South Morang line to Mernda commenced in 2016 and was opened on 29 August 2018. The project included of new electrified railway, new stations at Middle Gorge and Hawkstowe, and a new terminus at a rebuilt Mernda station.

In April 2019, the Victorian Government announced that Public Transport Victoria would be merged with VicRoads into a new Victorian Department of Transport.

== Future ==
A number of major expansion projects are under construction or planned for the network. In addition, a number of major upgrades are proposed, including the extension of the Level Crossing Removal Project, which will remove 110 level crossings and rebuild 51 stations across the suburban rail network.

In February 2015, the State Government established the Melbourne Metro Rail Authority to oversee planning for new twin nine-kilometre rail tunnels through the central city, between South Kensington station and South Yarra. The Metro Tunnel will have five new underground stations and connect the Gippsland line with the Sunbury line, creating a new route through the CBD as an alternative to the City Loop. New underground stations will be built at Arden, Parkville, Domain and there will be two new CBD stations, State Library and Town Hall. Enabling works were underway by 2016 and major construction work on the tunnel and stations began in 2017. The project has an estimated cost of $11 billion and is scheduled to be complete by 2025.

In September 2016, the State Government ordered 65 new High Capacity Metro Trains for delivery from mid-2019, which will eventually become the primary rolling stock used in the Metro Tunnel.

In April, June and July 2019, a number of rail lines in Melbourne&#x27;s east were shut down for several weeks to allow construction of the tunnel entrances near Kensington and South Yarra. The first tunnel boring machine began to be assembled in North Melbourne in June 2019. In May 2021, TBM Meg broke through at the future site of Town Hall station, marking the completion of tunnelling for the project. TBM Millie, Alice and Joan completed tunnelling over the previous month. The tunnelling phase lasted 20 months.

=== Airport rail link ===

A rail link to Melbourne Airport has been proposed repeatedly since the airport&#x27;s construction, with a variety of routes and service models suggested, but construction has never commenced. In July 2018, the Federal and State Governments each pledged A$5 billion (for a total of A$10 billion) to construct a rail link. The Federal Government proposed four possible routes for the link, with one proposal running via a direct tunnel to Highpoint Shopping Centre and the others linking to existing stations in Broadmeadows, Flemington or Sunshine.

An assessment of the four routes conducted by Rail Projects Victoria culminated in the route via Sunshine station being selected. The line with run through the Metro Tunnel and will include a new intermediate station at Keilor East to serve Melbourne&#x27;s north-west. Construction began in 2022, however by May 2023 the project was indefinitely paused, placing the expected completion by 2029 into doubt.

=== Suburban Rail Loop ===
In August 2018, in the run-up to the 2018 Victorian state election, the State Government pledged $300 million to complete a business case and secure funding to construct a new railway through suburban Melbourne. The project is designed to link major activity centres and amenities such as hospitals, shopping centres, universities, and Melbourne Airport. The proposal would connect most existing railway lines through middle suburbs and enable easier intra-suburban travel.The Suburban Rail Loop (SRL) would connect the existing station at Cheltenham with other existing stations at Clayton, Glen Waverley, Box Hill, Heidelberg, Reservoir, Fawkner, Broadmeadows, Sunshine and Werribee. It will also link to new stations to be built in areas that have long been promised rail connections, including Monash University, Burwood, Doncaster, Bundoora and Melbourne Airport. The first stage, SRL East, from Cheltenham to Box Hill is under construction and will open by 2035, with other sections progressively opening until the full line is operational by 2050.

=== Other planned extensions ===

The State Government is currently preparing a business case for electrification and extension of the Frankston line to Baxter in Melbourne&#x27;s South. The Federal Government committed $225 million towards the project in its 2017–2018 budget.

During the 2018 Victorian state election, the State Government also announced its Western Rail Plan, which would quadruplicate and electrify the rail lines to Melton and Wyndham Vale, allowing Metro services. Under this plan, Metro and V/Line regional services would be separated, allowing for higher speed trains to be introduced to Geelong and Ballarat. A new connection between Sunshine and Southern Cross Station to be built as part of the Airport rail link could add extra capacity for regional and metro lines. According to the Government, these lines could be fully electrified to Geelong and Ballarat and run at speeds of up to , significantly above the limit of current V/Line VLocity trains. Planning for the fast rail and electrification of the lines to Melton and Wyndham Vale will occur alongside planning for the Airport rail link, with construction set to start by 2022.

=== Level crossing removals ===

In 2015, the Andrews Government had announced a rail project that would oversee the removal of the remaining level crossings in metropolitan Melbourne. The key benefits of the project include:

* Improving safety
* Reducing congestion
* Improving reliability
* Increased service capacity

In 2016, the first level crossing removal was done on Burke Road, Glen Iris which resulted in a rebuild Gardiner station. Since then a total of 67 level crossings were removed through various methods.
== Infrastructure ==

=== Railway ===
The rail network within the Melbourne metropolitan area includes dedicated passenger lines, dedicated freight lines, and lines shared by the two types of traffic. Nearly all passenger traffic and some intrastate freight operates on , while all interstate freight traffic operates on .

Most suburban passenger lines operated by the metropolitan rail franchisee, currently Metro Trains Melbourne, are electrified with 1500 V DC overhead catenary. Many of the suburban lines share tracks with regional passenger trains operated by V/Line, and some V/Line services provide &quot;peri-urban&quot; service to areas of Melbourne not reached by the electrified network. Metro also operates an isolated section of unelectrified passenger line between Frankston and Stony Point.

The network is centred on Flinders Street and Southern Cross stations in the CBD, which are joined directly by a six-track viaduct and indirectly by the underground four-track City Loop. From this central core, nearly all tracks pass through the three major junction stations of North Melbourne, Jolimont, and Richmond; and from there extend outwards to the west, north-east and east of the city respectively. There are few connections between the radial lines outside of the central city. Capital investment in the network since 1990 has focused on relieving &quot;bottlenecks&quot; near the central core caused by the large number of lines converging, most significantly with the Regional Rail Link project which provided additional capacity between Sunshine and the city.

Much of the metropolitan network is double track or multiple pairs of tracks. There are small sections of triple track, which are used to allow express trains to overtake stopping trains in peak hour. Nearly the entirety of the Altona and Stony Point branches are single track, and many of the outer suburban passenger lines also have sections of single track, usually where demand for frequent services is low.

The metropolitan network has a large number of level crossings. Many have been gradually removed by grade separating road and rail traffic: by 2016, some 228 grade separations had been undertaken in the Melbourne area, leaving 170 level crossings, although very few projects of this nature had been undertaken in the latter half of the 20th century. The Level Crossing Removal Project, which began in 2014, aimed to increase the rate of level crossing removals to over 6 each year for at least 8 years, and the project was later extended for a further four years.

=== Stations ===

There are 218 stations in Melbourne, operated by Metro Trains Melbourne.

==== Host stations and premium stations ====
Host stations and premium stations are categories of railway stations on the suburban rail network. A premium station is staffed from first train to last, seven days a week, while a host station is staffed only during the morning peak. Of the 221 (current as of February 2024) stations on Melbourne&#x27;s railway network, there are 82 premium stations, in addition to the five City Loop stations.

Although plans for the premium station program were unveiled in 1991 (under the guise of &quot;Safe Stations&quot;), the program was commenced in 1994 by the Public Transport Corporation, with Mount Waverley being the first station given premium status. By the end of 1995 the number of staffed stations increased from 35 to 51. It was proposed to upgrade further stations to premium status in the future.

The host station program was introduced by the Victorian Department of Transport in the early 2000s to ensure that over 80% of suburban rail passengers started their journey from a staffed (host or premium) station.

==== Passenger information ====

Timetable information is available to passengers at stations through the PRIDE II system, which is an electronic timetable and announcement system, and stands for Passenger Real-time Information Dissemination Equipment. The system consists of:
* The control system, situated at Metrol.
* Control stations, at which staff update information, and announcements and CCTV recordings are dealt with for nearby stations.
* Public address systems at each station on the network. The PRIDE system automatically announces when a train is due soon, delayed, or cancelled; this is done via the rail telephone network.
* PRIDE &quot;talking boxes&quot; installed on each platform of all stations.
* Electronic passenger information displays.

Control data comes from two locations: Metrol, and control stations. Next train data and times are automatically updated by the train control systems, with manual overrides also possible.

All stations are provided with &quot;talking boxes&quot; which have two buttons and a small speaker.
The green button, when pressed, contacts the PRIDE controller over the rail telephone network, identifying itself by the DTMF tones that correspond to the ID number assigned to the box. The system then reads out times and destinations for the next three services to depart that platform (or, in the case of stations with a single island platform with departures either side, both platforms). The red button when pressed, gives the user two way communication with the closest control station.

Busy stations are often provided with an electronic LED s, which indicate the destination, time, stopping pattern summary, and minutes to departure for the next train on the platform.

Stations on the City Loop, in addition to North Melbourne, Richmond, and Box Hill stations, originally had CRT screen s, however all of these have since been replaced by widescreen LCD screens. These displays show in detail the destination, scheduled and actual departure time, and all stations the next train stops at. Also shown is the destination and time of the following two-to-three trains, and the system is capable of providing suggested connections and warn of service interruptions.

On 26 September 2010, the PRIDE system was upgraded with new voice announcements. The voice was female, and advised passengers to touch on and off when using Myki.

As part of the Bayside Rail Upgrade, stations on the Frankston line received new &quot;network status boards&quot;. The LCD screens provided travel information on all of Melbourne&#x27;s 16 railway lines, as well as tram &amp; bus services, including delays, replacement services or planned disruptions.

=== Safeworking ===
Most lines in Melbourne operate under an automatic block system of safeworking with three-position power signalling. That allows signals to be operated automatically by the passage of trains, enforcing a safe distance between them. At junctions, signals are manually controlled from signal boxes, with interlockings used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.

The outer end of the Hurstbridge line used to be operated with token based systems and two-position manual signalling, under which access to the line was based upon possession of a token. That system was discontinued in 2013.

Train stops are used to enforce stop indications on signals. Should a train pass a signal at danger, the train&#x27;s brakes will automatically be applied. Trains are also fitted with pilot valves, a form of dead man&#x27;s switch that applies the brakes should the driver fail to maintain a foot or hand pilot valve in a set position. The &quot;VICERS&quot; vigilance control and event recorder system is also being currently fitted to suburban trains to provide an additional level of safety.

=== Train control ===
The main control room for the rail network is Metrol. Located in the Melbourne CBD, it controls signals in the inner suburbs, tracking the location of all trains, as well as the handling the distribution of real time passenger information, and manages disruptions to the timetable. Additional signal boxes are located throughout the network, in direct communication with Metrol.

===Terminology===
The railways in Melbourne generally use British-derived terminology. For example:
* &quot;Up&quot; refers to the direction &quot;towards Melbourne&quot;.
* &quot;Down&quot; refers to the direction &quot;away from Melbourne&quot;, or &quot;towards the country&quot;.
* &quot;Points&quot; refers to what are known as railroad switches, or crossovers in American English.
* &quot;Signal box&quot; refers to the signal control installation (&quot;tower&quot; in American terminology).
* &quot;Gunzel&quot; terminology for a railway enthusiast

==Patronage==
The following table lists patronage figures for the network during the corresponding financial year. Australia&#x27;s financial years start on 1 July and end on 30 June. Major events that affected the number of journeys made or how patronage is measured are included as notes.


==Metropolitan services==

===Operations===
Despite initially being constructed and operated as private railways in the 1850s, following the establishment of the government-owned Victorian Railways in 1858 Melbourne&#x27;s suburban railway system has been state operated for the majority of its existence. In the 1920s Victorian Railways was the operator of the world&#x27;s busiest railway station (Flinders Street) and one of the world&#x27;s busiest railway networks. Following several high-profile collisions in the early 20th century, a number of network safety processes were implemented by the operator to improve passenger safety.

The agency name was shortened to VicRail in the early 1980s and then, later in the decade, the metropolitan system became known as Metropolitan Transit (&#x27;The Met&#x27;) and the regional system became known as V/Line. In preparation for privatisation the suburban system was split into Bayside Trains and Hillside Trains by the Kennett Ministry in 1998. Privatisation was completed in 1999 and M-Train and Connex Melbourne won the tender to operate Bayside, and Hillside trains, respectively. Following M&gt;Train&#x27;s inability to renegotiate financial arrangements, in 2004 Connex Melbourne assumed responsibility for the entire network. Current operations are provided by Metro Trains Melbourne, an MTR Corporation joint venture.

†Hillside Trains / Connex (2000–2004) – Clifton Hill and Burnley groups, Showgrounds services

=== Fleet ===

==== Current fleet ====
The majority of the current suburban train fleet in Melbourne is owned by VicTrack, with the train operator (currently Metro Trains Melbourne) responsible for maintaining the fleet. All trains on the Melbourne suburban network are electric and driver-only operated. Guards on suburban trains were discontinued between 1993 and 1995.

All trains are fitted with power-operated sliding doors which are closed by the driver, but opened by passengers. The doors of newer model HCMT, X&#x27;Trapolis and Siemens trains are opened electronically with a button, whilst Comeng trains are slid manually using handles. Trains are fitted with air conditioning, closed-circuit cameras, and emergency intercom systems. Trains are fixed into three car units and may operate alone or in pairs, except for the HCMT trains which run in singular seven car sets.
==== Future fleet ====
==== Decommissioned fleet ====
=== Lines ===
Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network includes 16 electrified suburban lines and 1 non-electrified line. Many lines have been lengthened over time, most notably the Mernda line from Epping to South Morang in 2012 and again to Mernda in 2018. Lines have also changed terminus or layout, including the forthcoming changes to the Cranbourne, Pakenham and Sunbury lines as part of the Melbourne Metro Rail Project. Numerous proposals for new lines or extensions not yet constructed have been made, including the long-outstanding Doncaster railway line and Rowville railway line.

==== Electrified lines ====
===== Non-electrified lines =====
*Deer Park–West Werribee railway line (non-electrified train service operated by V/Line)
*Stony Point railway line (non-electrified train service beyond Frankston)

===== Stony Point line and metropolitan V/Line services =====
Stony Point line services operate as shuttles from Frankston station with passengers to and from Flinders Street required to change trains. It is the only non-electrified line operated by Metro Trains, with services being operated using Sprinter diesel multiple units leased from V/Line.

Wyndham Vale (Geelong line) services are operated by V/Line and depart from Southern Cross, but are within the metropolitan ticketing zone. Wyndham Vale/Geelong trains also stop at Ardeer and Deer Park, along with Tarneit. Only Wyndham Vale and Ballarat trains stop at Ardeer, not Geelong trains.

5 morning peak and 3 afternoon peak trains operate to and from Wyndham Vale. One weekday morning service and numerous football services operate to Wyndham Vale.

Sunbury services used to also be operated by V/Line until 2012 when the electrical network was extended to Sunbury and these trains also stopped at Diggers Rest; Sunbury passengers can still catch V/Line trains to or from Bendigo. The redundant carriages were moved onto Bacchus Marsh services instead. V/Line trains used to also operate to Donnybrook, stopping at Craigieburn but since the electrical network was extended to Craigieburn in 2007, trains have stopped terminating at Donnybrook.

=== Service patterns ===

Metropolitan services are operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. Railway lines and service patterns are often classified into groups, which are:
*Burnley group
**Lilydale, Belgrave, Alamein and Glen Waverley line (blue)
*Caulfield group
**Pakenham and Cranbourne line (light blue)
**Sandringham line (pink)
*Clifton Hill group
**Mernda and Hurstbridge line (red)
*Northern group
**Sunbury, Craigieburn and Upfield line (yellow)
*Cross-City group
**Frankston, Werribee and Williamstown line (green)
**Stony Point line (non-electrified train service beyond Frankston)
*Special event services
**Flemington Racecourse/Showgrounds

All lines (except for the Frankston, Werribee, Williamstown and Sandringham lines) use the city loop. The Clifton Hill Group runs clockwise all day and the Caulfield Group runs Counter-Clockwise all day. The Burnley Group runs counter-clockwise in the morning and switches to clockwise in the afternoon. The Northern Group runs clockwise in the morning and counter-clockwise on the afternoon. As of 1 January 2021, Frankston and Newport (Werribee and Williamstown) trains have been completely removed out of the City Loop. When the Metro Tunnel opens in 2025, Pakenham, Cranbourne and Sunbury line trains will be removed from the loop, and the Frankston line will move back into the Caulfield loop. Also at this time, the Werribee line will run direct to Sandringham and vice versa.

Melbourne uses clock-face scheduling in off-peak periods, but generally not in rush hour, due to the network operating near to infrastructure capacity and having to accommodate single-line sections, flat junctions, and regional diesel-hauled trains. Frequencies vary according to time of day, day of week and by line. In some places, usually interchange stations, services on two lines combine to provide more frequent services on common sections of tracks. All services become 24-hour from Friday morning to Sunday evening, with at least one departure every hour after 12am.

Along with other Australian railways, Melbourne uses the British terminology of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, with &quot;up&quot; being defined as toward Flinders Street station in the CBD.

==== Fares and tickets ====

The myki smart-card ticketing system is the main ticketing system currently in use across Melbourne, introduced in 2010. Prior to December 2012 Melbourne also used a magnetic strip paper ticket system known as the Metcard, first introduced to the railway network in 1996. On 29 December 2012 Metcard was no longer available for use on Melbourne&#x27;s public transport and completely replaced by myki. Multi-modal tickets were first introduced in Melbourne in 1969 and prior to this train, tram and bus services all had separated ticketing systems.

==Regional services==
V/Line regional services share tracks with several suburban train lines from the outskirts of Melbourne to the regional railway terminus at Southern Cross station (with the Traralgon V/Line rail service terminating at Flinders Street station). The Pakenham line has the longest shared track section which is used by V/Line services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale. The Sunbury and Craigieburn lines also share lesser sections of track with counterpart regional lines.

The Regional Rail Link project separated suburban services from regional trains on the Geelong, Wendouree (Ballarat) and Bendigo lines. A ceremonial start of construction was held in August 2009 and the project was completed in June 2015.

==Freight services==

Melbourne also has an extensive network of railway lines and yards to serve freight traffic. These freight lines are of two gauges— broad gauge and , and are not electrified. In the inner western suburbs of the city, freight trains operate on dedicated lines, but in other areas freight trains share tracks with the suburban Metro Trains Melbourne and regional V/Line passenger services. The majority of freight terminals are located in the inner suburbs around Port of Melbourne, others are located between the Melbourne CBD and Footscray.

Until the 1980s a number of suburban stations had their own goods yards, with freight trains running over the suburban network, often with the E or L class electric locomotives.

==Heritage services and preservation==

Melbourne also has 3 tourist railways, 3 main line heritage operators, and 1 railway museum.

Organised railway preservation commenced in Victoria with the formation of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society in 1955, and operating under the Emerald Tourist Railway Board from 1977. Formed to operate the narrow gauge gauge railway in the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne, the group continues to operate the railway today.

The demise of the last of the steam locomotives in Victoria commenced in the 1960s, with the Australian Railway Historical Society and Association of Railway Enthusiasts working with the Victorian Railways to have a number of locomotives preserved for the future. In 1962 the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum was established at Williamstown North to house static exhibits, and Steamrail Victoria was formed in 1965 to assist in the restoration of locomotives and carriages for use on special trains.

== Legislation, governance and access ==

=== Key statutes ===
The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act. The Act establishes the Department of Transport as the integration agency for Victoria&#x27;s transport system. The Act also establishes and sets the charters of the state agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the Director of Public Transport and V/Line. In addition, the Act creates VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the state&#x27;s rail network.

=== Safety ===

==== Regulation ====
The safety of rail operations in Melbourne is regulated by the Rail Safety Act 2006 which applies to all commercial passenger and freight operations as well as tourist and heritage railways. The Act creates a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires rail operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations. Accredited rail operators are also required to have a safety management system to guide their operations.

Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the Rail Safety Act are contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. The safety regulator for the rail system in Melbourne is the Director, Transport Safety (trading as Transport Safety Victoria) whose office is established under the Transport Integration Act 2010.

==== Investigation ====

Rail operators in Victoria can also be the subject of no blame investigations conducted by the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety or the Australian Transport Safety Bureau(ATSB). The Chief Investigator is charged by the Transport Integration Act with conducting investigations into rail safety matters including incidents and trends. ATSB, on the other hand, has jusridiction over the same matters where they occur on the Defined Interstate Rail Network.

=== Ticketing and conduct ===
Ticketing requirements for public transport in Melbourne are mainly contained in the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006 and the Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual. Rules about safe and fair conduct on trains and trams in Melbourne are generally contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983 and the Transport (Conduct) Regulations 2005. If Metro does not reach its Punctuality and Delivery goals they will give out compensation to eligible customers. In the month of December 2014, Metro Trains had a delivery rate of 98.5%, and a Punctuality rate of 93.60%. In 2014, Metro Trains were accused of not stopping at underpopulated suburbs&#x27; stations in order to arrive on time, this practise has been condemned by the general public and the media. They have offered compensation to affected passengers.

=== Tourist and heritage railways ===

Tourist and Heritage Railways in Melbourne and Victoria are currently governed by provisions in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. In future, they will be regulated by the recently enacted Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010, which commenced in October 2011.

<doc id="944246" wikidata="Q4756832" url="?curid=944246" title="Andrew Downes (composer)">
<text>Andrew Downes (20 August 1950 – 2 January 2023) was a British classical composer. He was head of the School of Composition and Creative Studies at Birmingham Conservatoire from 1992 until 2005. His compositions have been performed and broadcast internationally.

== Early life ==
Downes was born in Handsworth, Birmingham. He attended St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, on a scholarship, receiving his master&#x27;s degree in composition. In 1974 he studied with Herbert Howells at the Royal College of Music. Downes was head of the School of Composition and Creative Studies at Birmingham Conservatoire from 1992 until 2005, when he retired due to ill health. He kept working as a freelance composer.

== Career ==
In addition to live performances, Downes&#x27; music has been broadcast on BBC Radios 2, 3, and 4, BBC TV, France Musique, Italian TV, Austrian Radio, Dutch Radio, Czech Radio, and Central Peking Radio. Seventeen CDs have been made of his music.

He composed &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot; for the Royal opening of the Adrian Boult Hall in Birmingham in 1986, and his &quot;Centenary Fire Dances&quot; were first performed for the City of Birmingham&#x27;s Centenary Festival of Fireworks and Music. He wrote an &quot;Overture&quot; for the Three Choirs Festival.

He wrote &quot;Mela Kamavardhani&quot; for Indo-Jazz Fusions musicians in Calcutta, Delhi, and Bombay, and &quot;Fanfare for Madam Speaker&quot; for the installation of Betty Boothroyd MP as Chancellor of the Open University in 1994. Instrumental music included &quot;Concerto for Two Guitars&quot; written for Simon Dinnigan and Fred T. Baker playing with strings from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the &quot;Concert Overture Towards a New Age&quot; commissioned for the 150th anniversary of the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers, which was premiered at the Symphony Hall, Birmingham, by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and &quot;Suite for Brass Sextet&quot; written for the Czech Philharmonic Brass Sextet.

<doc id="944247" wikidata="Q7870240" url="?curid=944247" title="USS Hopewell (DD-681)">
<text>USS &quot;Hopewell&quot; (DD-681) was a in service the United States Navy from 1943 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1970. She was finally sunk as a target in 1972.

==History==
&quot;Hopewell&quot; was named in honour of Pollard Hopewell of St. Mary&#x27;s county, Maryland (USA). She was launched by Bethlehem Shipbuilding, San Pedro, California on 2 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. R. A. Spruance, wife of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance; and commissioned at Terminal Island on 30 September 1943.

===World War II===
&quot;Hopewell&quot; conducted shakedown training in the San Diego area before sailing for Hawaii 13 January 1944. She got underway 23 January for the invasion of the Marshalls, as American amphibious task forces picked up momentum in their drive toward Japan. Steaming as a forward picket ship, &quot;Hopewell&quot; arrived off Kwajalein on 31 January and delivered gunfire support during the initial assault. That night she bombarded Roi and Namur Islands and 1 February moved to screening and patrol duties off the other islands of the group. With the success of the landings assured, &quot;Hopewell&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 24 February.

The destroyer arrived at Purvis Bay, Florida Islands on 14 March to take part in the developing offensive on the northern coast of New Guinea. She carried out screening and patrol assignments, and contributed shore bombardment during the Aitape landings, part of the bold Hollandia operation. After Aitape, an unopposed operation carried out 22 April, &quot;Hopewell&quot; remained with 7th Fleet patrolling and screening. With three other destroyers she carried out a bombardment of Japanese positions on New Ireland on 29 May, and in June joined escort carrier on antisubmarine patrol.

&quot;Hopewell&quot; next operation was the invasion of Morotai, necessary as an air base for the Philippines campaign to come. She arrived 16 September, the day after the initial landing, to assume screening duties, and shot down an attacking Japanese plane that day. On 18 September, she supported an auxiliary landing on Morotai, and sailed 25 September with a convoy for Humboldt Bay.

The invasion of the Philippines began with the Leyte landings 20 October, and four days later &quot;Hopewell&quot; arrived with a reinforcement group. A damaged propeller kept her from taking part in the four-part Battle of Leyte Gulf, in which the Imperial Japanese Navy suffered defeat on 24–25 October. Next day she departed in the van of a convoy and shaped course for Humboldt Bay, where repairs could be effected. At the eastern entrance to the Gulf the convoy was attacked, and in the battle that followed &quot;Hopewell&quot; made concealing smoke and shot down two aircraft.

The ship sailed again 8 November for Leyte, and after two trips from Humboldt Bay and return with convoys, she joined the Mindoro invasion forces. After fighting off heavy air attacks en route, &quot;Hopewell&quot; arrived off the assault area 15 December and provided fire support as troops stormed ashore. As air attacks continued, the ship helped fight fires on and assisted in shooting down other planes before sailing again for Leyte at noon.

With Mindoro in Allied hands, and air bases for the Luzon invasion under construction, &quot;Hopewell&quot; prepared for that operation, to be carried out initially at Lingayen Gulf. She sailed 4 January and fought off Japanese kamikaze attacks on the passage to Lingayen, for the landings 9 January joined the screen of an escort carrier group providing air cover. &quot;Hopewell&quot; joined in the amphibious assault on Corregidor 14 February, and while clearing obstructions from Mariveles Bay with gunfire engaged a large battery on &quot;the rock&quot;. The destroyer laid smoke and moved in to help damaged , and soon received four hits, putting her battery control station out of commission. Although suffering 17 casualties, &quot;Hopewell&quot; remained in Manila Bay until 18 February, when she sailed to Manus for repairs.

The ship next continued to San Francisco, arriving 17 March, and after further repairs sailed for Pearl Harbor 28 May 1945. Training operations in Hawaiian waters occupied her until 20 July, when she sailed for Eniwetok and Guam. The day of the Japanese surrender, &quot;Hopewell&quot; sailed from Guam with a refueling group supporting famed Task Force 38 which had done so much to bring victory. She operated in Japanese waters in support of the occupation until 21 October 1945, when she sailed for the United States via Pearl Harbor. Arriving Puget Sound Navy Yard 8 November, she later moved to San Diego, where she decommissioned 15 January 1947 and was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===Korean War===
With the increased demands of the Korean War, &quot;Hopewell&quot; recommissioned 28 March 1951 at San Diego. Immediately following shakedown training she steamed westward to Korea 18 June, taking up screening duties with Task Force 77 as carrier based aircraft blasted Communist positions. The destroyer also bombarded Wonsan and served on the Formosa Patrol August–September 1951, returning to Mare Island Yard 5 February 1952.

&quot;Hopewell&quot; sailed for her second tour in Korea 11 August 1952 after shakedown and training exercises. During this period of stalemate in the land war, the Navy continued to operate against supply lines and strong points, and &quot;Hopewell&quot; screened the carriers and heavy ships of Task Force 77. Bombardment of Wonsan followed another period of Formosa Patrol, and in December the ship steamed to Formosa to help train Nationalist Chinese sailors. She returned briefly to Korea to screen battleship during bombardment operations late in January 1953, and sailed for the United States 3 March 1953.

After operating off the California coast for several months on antisubmarine training, &quot;Hopewell&quot; sailed again for the Far East 27 October 1953. She again took part in training exercises and patrol off Formosa, returning to San Diego 23 May 1954. As she began her fourth cruise, a new crisis between Communist China and Formosa developed, and in February &quot;Hopewell&quot; assisted in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. Following this Cold War operation, the destroyer took part in fleet exercises in the western Pacific, returning to San Diego 22 May 1955.

The veteran ship spent the remainder of 1955 on exercises off the coast. On 11 November during an amphibious training operation, a single engine attack bomber crashed into &quot;Hopewell&quot; amidships, killing five and starting gasoline fires. Alert firefighters brought the flames under control and the ship returned to San Diego for lengthy repairs. The Mt 53 5&quot;38 gun mount was destroyed by the crash and not replaced which distinguished her as the only Fletcher Class with only four 5&quot;38 gun mounts.

Returning to active operations again 24 March 1956, when she sailed for the Far East, &quot;Hopewell&quot; resumed her regular pattern of cruises to Japan, Formosa, and Okinawa interspersed with training and readiness exercises off the West Coast of the United States. She operated with Korean and Nationalist Chinese ships on maneuvers in 1958 and 1959 and continued to act as an integral part of America fleet in the Pacific. On 12 November 1959 &quot;Hopewell&quot; returned to San Diego for extensive refitting and training.

===Vietnam===
&quot;Hopewell&quot; was repeatedly deployed from the West Coast to South Vietnam from 1960 through July 1969 in defense of the Republic of Vietnam. In February 1963 she rescued a crewman from a downed Douglas A-3B Skywarrior from the attack aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. &quot;Hopewell&quot; deployed 5 August 1964 for the &quot;Taiwan Patrol.&quot; The Gulf of Tonkin Incident occurred, and &quot;Hopewell&quot; was sent to the gunline off Vietnam to conduct fire missions. She returned to San Diego 6 February 1965. During the summer of 1965, &quot;Hopewell&quot; visited San Francisco, Puget Sound, and Hawaii as part of the Pacific Midshipman Training Squadron. &quot;Hopewell&quot; deployed a second time to Vietnam on 1 March 1966 and returned to San Diego in early August 1966. During that cruise she fired 2,276 rounds, destroyed 112 structures, and silenced a Viet Cong mortar attack upon ground forces. For the remainder of 1966, she acted as school ship in gunnery and ASW off the West Coast. She then went to the yards in Hunters Point in late 1966 and early 1967.

On 3 October 1967, the &quot;Hopewell&quot; was on her way from Sasebo, Japan to Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin. At 1602, while alongside the , she lost power to her steering motor and collided with &quot;Oriskany&quot;. There were no casualties, but damage to the ship required that she be detached to Subic Bay for repairs.

===Fate===
She was decommissioned 2 January 1970 and sunk as target for the test of a Walleye II missile on 11 February 1972. The wreck of &quot;Hopewell&quot; was located and dove on 12 February 2011 by the UB88 Project (Kendall Raine, John Walker &amp; Scott Brooks-support diver).

&quot;Hopewell&quot; received nine battle stars for World War II service and four for Korean service.

<text>Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis, CBE, MC (28 May 1883 – 9 April 1978) was a Welsh architect known chiefly as the creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales. He became a major figure in the development of Welsh architecture in the first half of the 20th century, in a variety of styles and building types.

==Early life==

Clough Williams-Ellis was born in Gayton, Northamptonshire, England, but his family moved back to his father&#x27;s native North Wales when he was four. The family have strong Welsh roots and Clough Williams-Ellis claimed direct descent from Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales. His father John Clough Williams Ellis (1833–1913) was a clergyman and noted mountaineer while his mother Ellen Mabel Greaves (1851–1941) was the daughter of the slate mine proprietor John Whitehead Greaves and sister of John Ernest Greaves.

He was educated at Oundle School in Northamptonshire. Though he read for the natural sciences tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, he never graduated. After a few months at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London in 1903–04 (which he located by looking up &quot;Architecture&quot; in the London telephone directory), he worked for an architect for a few months before setting up his own practice in London. His first commission was Larkbeare, a summer house for Anne Wynne Thackeray in Cumnor, Oxfordshire, in 1903-04 (finished 1907) which he designed while still a student.

In 1908 he inherited a small country house, Plas Brondanw, from his father, which he would restore and embellish through the rest of his life, as well as rebuilding it after a fire in 1951.

==Military service==
Williams-Ellis served with distinction in the First World War, first with the Royal Fusiliers and then with the Welsh Guards as an intelligence officer attached to the Tank Corps. He was described as lieutenant on the day of his wedding.

==Architectural career==

After the war, Williams-Ellis helped John St Loe Strachey (later his father-in-law) revive pisé construction in Britain, building an apple storehouse followed by Harrowhill Copse bungalow at Newlands Corner using shuttering and rammed earth.

One of his earliest designs of 1905 was for a pair of Welsh labourers&#x27; cottages in a vernacular style with end gable chimneys which imitate the 16th-century Snowdonia Houses In 1909 he designed a house in an advanced Arts and Crafts style for Cyril Joynson at Brecfa in Breconshire In 1913–1914 he was responsible for the rebuilding of Llangoed Hall in Breconshire, one of the last country houses to be built before the First World War. While it is a mixture of a number of historic styles, it also has modern features with elements such as the chimneys derived from the work of Lutyens. Other work in Wales by Clough Williams-Ellis includes the Festiniog Memorial Hospital of 1922, Pentrefelin Village Hall, and the Conway Fall Cafe.
In 1925, Williams-Ellis acquired the land in North Wales that would become the Italianate village of Portmeirion (made famous in the 1960s as the location of the cult TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, and the 1976 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Masque of Mandragora&quot;). Portmeirion is notable not only as an architectural composition, but also because Clough Williams-Ellis was able to preserve fragments from other now demolished buildings from Wales and Cheshire. These include the plaster ceiling from Emral Hall

In 1928, Williams-Ellis wrote his book &quot;England and the Octopus&quot; (published in 1928); its outcry at the urbanization of the countryside and loss of village cohesion inspired a group of young women to form Ferguson&#x27;s Gang. They took up Williams-Ellis&#x27;s call for action and from 1927 to 1946 were active in rescuing important, but lesser-known, rural properties from being demolished. Shalford Mill in Surrey, Newtown Old Town Hall on the Isle of Wight and Priory Cottages in Oxfordshire were all successfully saved due to the Gang&#x27;s fundraising efforts. The Gang endowed these properties and significant tracts of the Cornish coastline to the care of the National Trust. The Gang&#x27;s mastermind Peggy Pollard (known within the Gang by her pseudonym Bill Stickers) and Williams-Ellis became lifelong friends.

In 1929 Williams-Ellis bought portrait painter George Romney&#x27;s house in Hampstead.

By the 1930s, Williams-Ellis had become a fashionable British architect; he was commissioned to create numerous works throughout the UK. These include buildings at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, cottages in Cornwell, Oxfordshire, Tattenhall in Cheshire, and Cushendun, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. During the 1930s he also designed the former summit building on Wales&#x27; highest mountain, Snowdon. However, after a reduction in window sizes (they kept blowing in) and further alterations in the 1960s and the 1980s, it was in a poor state by the end of the 20th century. Prince Charles described it as &quot;the highest slum in Wales&quot;.

Williams-Ellis served on several government committees concerned with design and conservation and was instrumental in setting up the British national parks after 1945. The following year he was appointed inaugural chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation by Lewis Silkin. He wrote and broadcast extensively on architecture, design and the preservation of the rural landscape. He was a member of the Knickerbocker Club.
At Aberdaron he designed the Old Post Office in a vernacular style in 1950. An important later commission was the redesign and rebuilding of Nantclwyd Hall in Denbighshire Clough Williams- Ellis was equally capable in working in the Modernist idiom of the interwar years. This is well demonstrated by the recently restored Caffi Moranedd at Cricieth and the former Snowdon Summit Station of 1934, which was demolished in 2007.

In 1958 Williams-Ellis was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) &quot;for public services&quot;. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the New Years Honours List of 1972 &quot;for services to the preservation of the environment and to architecture&quot;. At the time, he was the oldest person ever to be knighted.

==Personal life==
In 1915 Williams-Ellis married the writer Amabel Strachey. Their eldest daughter, Susan Williams-Ellis (1918–2007), used the name Portmeirion Pottery for the company she created with her husband in 1961. The second daughter, Charlotte Rachel Anwyl Williams-Ellis (1919–2010), was a zoologist and environmentalist with a Cambridge PhD in agricultural science. She married the agriculturalist Lindsay Russell Wallace in 1945, and moved to New Zealand. Their youngest child, Christopher Moelwyn Strachey Williams-Ellis (1923 – 13 March 1944) served as a lieutenant in the Welsh Guards during the Second World War. He was killed in action and is buried at Minturno War Cemetery.

Welsh language novelist Robin Llywelyn is his grandson, and fashion designer Rose Fulbright-Vickers is his great-granddaughter. Sculptor David Williams-Ellis, the stepfather of Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, is his great-nephew.

==Death==
Sir Clough Williams-Ellis died in April 1978, aged 94. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated. Twenty years after his death some of his ashes were placed in a marine rocket that was launched in a New Year&#x27;s Eve firework display over the estuary at Portmeirion.

<text>Radoslav Katičić (; 3 July 1930 – 10 August 2019) was a Croatian linguist, classical philologist, Indo-Europeanist, Slavist and Indologist, one of the most prominent Croatian scholars in the humanities.

==Biography==
Radoslav Katičić was born on 3 July 1930 in Zagreb which was part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia at the time. In 1949, he graduated at the classical gymnasium in his home town.

At the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, he received a degree in Classical Philology in 1954. The same year he started working as a part-time librarian at the Seminar for Classical Philology at the same faculty. His first scientific works were on Ancient Greek philology and Byzantine studies.

As a stipendist of the Greek government, he visited Athens in 1956-57, and in 1958 he was elected as an assistant at the Department for Comparative Indo-European Grammar at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb.

In 1959, he received his Ph.D. with the thesis &quot;Pitanje jedinstva indoeuropske glagolske fleksije&quot; (&#x27;The question of unity of Indo-European verbal flexion&#x27;). During the period of 1960-61, he was a stipendist of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Tübingen. After returning to his main university, he became a docent on Indo-European and general linguistics. Soon after, he served as a head of the newly formed Department for General Linguistics and Oriental Studies. In 1966, he became an associate, and, in 1973, a full professor. Beside general and Indo-European linguistics, he also taught Old Iranian and Old Indic philology.

In 1976, he became a full professor of Slavic philology at the University of Vienna, Austria.

In 1973, he was selected as an extraordinary member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts), and, in 1987, he became a full member. In 1981, he became a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in 1989, becoming a full member, and since 1989, serving as a head of the renowned &quot;Balkan Commission&quot;. In 1984, he became a member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1987, a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, and in 1991, a member of the Academia Europaea. In 2011, he became a member of Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and in 2012, of Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo. In 1989, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Osijek, and in 1999, an honorary degree and professorship at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest.

In 2005, he became the head of Council for Standard Croatian Language Norm. He served in that role until council&#x27;s abolition in 2012.

==Work==
In the past twenty years he chiefly researched on the topic of history of Croatian grammar, philology, early Croatian Middle Ages, engaging in extensive synthetic research of the key periods of history of Croatian literature and the reconstruction of Proto-Slavic ceremonial texts, sacral poetry of mythological content, and legislative literature. Some aspects of his work meet criticism, primarily his puristic approach to the linguistic terminology, the primordialist view of nations, and subjectivity in articles on language policy. Besides, his syntactic description has been judged negatively by other Croatian syntacticians.

Katičić&#x27;s scholarly contributions which consists of more than 150 titles (books and papers) can be divided in five fields:
* General linguistics and Paleo-Balkan studies (mainly based on transformational grammar approach), consisting of works written in English:
** &quot;A Contribution to the General Theory of Comparative Linguistics&quot; (the Hague-Paris, 1970)
** &quot;The Ancient Languages of the Balkans, 1-2&quot; (the Hague-Paris, 1976)
* Linguistic-stylistic works on aspects and history of various European (Ancient Greek, Byzantine) and non-European literatures:
** &quot;Stara indijska književnost/Old Indian literature&quot; (Zagreb, 1973)
* Numerous studies on Croatian language history, from the inception of the Croats in the 7th century onwards. Katičić has charted the meanderings in the continuity of Croatian language and literature, from the earliest stone inscriptions and Glagolitic medieval literature in the Croatian recension of Church Slavonic to the works of Renaissance writers such as Marin Držić and Marko Marulić, who wrote in a Croatian vernacular. He also explored language standardization and wrote a syntactic description of modern Croatian (&quot;Sintaksa hrvatskoga književnoga jezika&quot;/&quot;Syntax of Standard Croatian&quot;, Zagreb, 1986), based on texts by contemporary authors such as Miroslav Krleža and Tin Ujević.
* Synthetic works that explore the beginnings of Croatian civilization in a multidisciplinary fashion based on philology, archeology, culturology, paleography and textual analysis:
** &quot;Uz početke hrvatskih početaka/Roots of Croatian roots&quot; (Split 1993)
** &quot;Litterarium studia&quot; (Vienna-Zagreb, 1999, in German and Croatian)
* Reconstruction of Proto-Slavic sacral poetry and Slavic pre-Christian faith:
** &quot;Božanski boj: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine&quot; (Zagreb, 2008)
** &quot;Zeleni lug: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine&quot; (Zagreb, 2010)
** &quot;Gazdarica na vratima: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine&quot; (Zagreb, 2011)
** &quot;Vilinska vrata: I dalje tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine&quot; (Zagreb, 2014)
** &quot;Naša stara vjera: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine&quot; (Zagreb, 2017)

<text>Matajur () is a mountain in the Julian Alps on the border between Italy and Slovenia. It is located on the border between the Soča Valley and the Italian mountainous region known as Venetian Slovenia, with views over the Adriatic Sea. Its prominence is .

==Name==
Matajur was attested as &quot;Mons Regis&quot; circa 680, and as &quot;in Monte Majori&quot; in 1275. The Slovene name &quot;Matajur&quot; is derived via vowel harmony or akanye from &quot;*Motajur&quot; (&lt; &quot;Mǫtmajur&quot;), which was borrowed from a Friulian name that developed from Romance &quot;Monte(m) maiōre(m)&quot; &#x27;higher mountain&#x27;. It is known as &quot;Mat&#x27;jur&quot; in the local dialect, and in Friulian as &quot;Mòntmaiôr&quot; or &quot;Mataiûr&quot; (a reborrowing from Slovene). Another old name for this peak is Velika Baba.

==History==
On 26 October 1917, Oberleutnant Erwin Rommel captured the mountain during the battle of Caporetto of World War I.

<text>Brooklyn the Musical is a musical with a book, lyrics, and music by Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson. It was acquired for licensing by Broadway Licensing

==Synopsis==
Using the play within a play structure, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; focuses on a group of five ragtag homeless musicians known as the City Weeds. The group periodically transforms a street corner under the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge into a stage where they present their play about a Parisian singer Brooklyn, named after the New York City borough from which her wayward father Taylor hailed. Orphaned when her depressed mother Faith hangs herself, the girl in quick succession is sent to live in a convent where she discovers her vocal talents, becomes a star, performs at Carnegie Hall, sets out in search of her father (who she discovers is a drug-addicted Vietnam War vet), and engages in a competition with local diva Paradice at Madison Square Garden.

From the original Broadway souvenir program:

Once upon a time, a famous young Parisian came to America to search for the Father she never knew. Her only clue, her name... Brooklyn. The &quot;Reigning Diva of the Decade&quot;, Ms. Paradice is threatened by Brooklyn&#x27;s new-found fame. She challenges Brooklyn to a &quot;Battle Of The Divas&quot; at Madison Square Garden. Brooklyn accepts to deliver the Father she has yet to find. Feeling the soul of the city that bears her name, Brooklyn is moved by a street performer who plays a rusty old crowbar as if it were a Golden Saxophone. The Streetsinger leads Brooklyn to her father. She learns the truth of who he is and where he&#x27;s been. Although our &quot;Wicked Witch Of The Hood&quot; Ms. Paradice is about to wreak havoc with our heroine and her father, she doesn&#x27;t mind if you love to hate her, because after all that&#x27;s still love. Moments before showtime, the wicked Ms. Paradice confronts Brooklyn&#x27;s Father she comes bearing gifts. The &quot;Battle Of The Divas&quot; begins. Ms. Paradice takes the stage. She warns America not to turn its back on her now or they call &quot;Kiss My Black Ass!&quot; Brooklyn finds herself center stage, abandoned by her Father. The crowd roared, the votes poured in. Paradice Won! Brooklyn was just another face in the crowd. However, in that crowd was another face. &quot;So you gotta ask yourself, do you believe in happy endings?&quot;

==Production==
Schoenfeld and McPherson had collaborated on a record more than two decades earlier but lost touch until McPherson, now a Massachusetts housewife, encountered her former partner singing on a Brooklyn street corner as a means of support. She invited him to live with her and her family, and the two began to write songs based on Schoenfeld&#x27;s experiences. They eventually wrote the plot with elements of &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, and every fairy tale that ever ended happily ever after.

The musical&#x27;s stage premiere was on April 30, 2003 at the New Denver Civic Theater (Denver, CO) and ran through June 15, 2003. This production starred Eden Espinosa.

The musical premiered on Broadway on October 21, 2004 at the Plymouth Theatre (renamed the Gerald Schoenfeld), and closed on June 26, 2005 after 284 performances and 27 previews. Directed by Jeff Calhoun, the cast included Eden Espinosa as Brooklyn, Karen Olivo as Faith, Kevin Anderson as Taylor, Ramona Keller as Paradice, and Cleavant Derricks as a street singer who acts as the narrator.
==National tour and other productions==
A 2006 national tour starred &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist Diana DeGarmo as Brooklyn and Melba Moore as Paradice. Cleavant Derricks reprised his performance as Street Singer, with original cast member Julie Reiber as Faith, and Lee Morgan as Taylor Collins.

In 2008 Brooklyn made its professional regional premiere at Wisconsin&#x27;s The Armory located in Janesville, WI. The limited engagement, arranged through Brooklyn&#x27;s original producers, ran from May 8 to June 1, 2008. The Armory production featured Elyssa Samsel in the title role with John Edwards (Street Singer), Brett J. Frazier (Taylor Collins), Chelsea Waller (Paradice), and Julie Marie Eberhart (Faith). This production also added two more voices and featured Don Seward and Amy Linden in the ensemble.

Baldwin Wallace College was granted the rights to put on a regional production in Berea, Ohio in April 2008. It played at Playhouse Square&#x27;s 14th Street Theatre in May 2008.

A Brazilian production played in June 2012 in São Paulo.

In February, 2018, Footlite Musicals was granted rights to put on a production in Indianapolis, Indiana. The production was staged in cabaret style with the audience seated on the stage. The production was received favorably, selling out the vast majority of the shows. The production was nominated for and won Encore Association Awards in the following categories: Best Production of a Musical (Amy Douglas), Best Director of a Musical (Kathleen Clarke Horrigan), Best Lead Actress in a Musical (Shelbi Berry), Best Female Singer (Shelbi Berry), Best Ensemble in a Musical, Best Vocal Direction (Caleb Morgan), Best Music Direction (Linda Parr), Best Set Design of a Musical (Stepen Matters), Best Set Decoration of a Musical (Stephen Matters, Mary Lich, Laura Baker), Best Lighting Design for a Musical (Andrew Stephens), Best Light Board Operator for a Musical (Sean Cassada) and received the following Encore Association nominations: Best Lead Actor in a Musical (Stevie Jones, Donny Torres), Best Lead Actress in a Musical (Paige Brown, Kendra Randle), Best Male Singer (Stevie Jones, Donny Torres), Best Female Singer (Paige Brown, Kendra Randle), Best Costumes for a Musical (Curt Pickard.)

<text>Abetti is a lunar impact crater that has been completely submerged by mare lavas. It forms a &#x27;ghost crater&#x27; in the surface, showing only a curved rise where the rim is located. Abetti is located near the southeast edge of Mare Serenitatis, to the west of the Mons Argaeus. This crater is generally visible only at low angles of illumination. It is named after two Italian astronomers, Antonio Abetti and his son Giorgio.

<doc id="944291" wikidata="Q428986" url="?curid=944291" title="Linear city (Soria design)">
<text>The linear city is an urban plan for an elongated urban formation that was proposed by Arturo Soria y Mata in 1882. The city would consist of a series of functionally specialized parallel sectors. Generally, the city would run parallel to a river and be built so that the dominant wind would blow from the residential areas to the industrial strip. The sectors of a linear city would be:

# a purely segregated zone for railway lines, 
# a zone of production and communal enterprises, with related scientific, technical and educational institutions, 
# a residential zone, including a band of social institutions, a band of residential buildings and a &quot;children&#x27;s band&quot;, 
# a park zone, 
# an agricultural zone with gardens and state-run farms (&quot;sovkhozy&quot; in the Soviet Union).

As the city expanded, additional sectors would be added to the end of each band, so that the city would become ever longer, without growing wider.

The linear city design was first developed by Arturo Soria y Mata in Madrid, Spain during the 19th century, but was promoted by the Soviet planner Nikolay Alexandrovich Milyutin in the late 1920s. Milyutin justified placing production enterprises and schools in the same band with Engels&#x27; statement that &quot;education and labour will be united&quot;.

Ernst May, a famous German functionalist architect, formulated his initial plan for Magnitogorsk, a new city in the Soviet Union, primarily following the model that he had established with his Frankfurt settlements: identical, equidistant five-story communal apartment buildings and an extensive network of dining halls and other public services.

<doc id="944292" wikidata="Q909158" url="?curid=944292" title="Oslo Stock Exchange">
<text>Oslo Stock Exchange () (OSE: OSLO) is a stock exchange within the Nordic countries and offers Norway&#x27;s only regulated markets for securities trading today. The stock exchange offers a full product range including equities, derivatives and fixed income instruments.

The Euronext consortium of European stock exchanges controls Oslo Stock Exchange as of June 2019.

==History==
Oslo Børs was established by a law of September 18, 1818. Trading on Oslo Børs commenced on April 15, 1819.

In 1881, Oslo Børs became a stock exchange, which means securities were listed. The first listing of securities contained 16 bond series and 23 stocks, including the Norwegian central bank (Norges Bank).

Oslo Børs cooperates with London Stock Exchange on trading systems. The exchange has also a partnership with the stock exchanges in Singapore and Toronto (Canada) for a secondary listing of companies.

The stock exchange was privatized in 2001, and is, after the merger in 2007, 100% owned by Oslo Børs VPS Holding ASA.

Oslo Børs Holding ASA was the holding company that owned Oslo Stock Exchange of Norway from 2001 to 2008. The company was created in 2001 when the Oslo Stock Exchange was converted from a self-owning institution to a public limited company. The ownership of Oslo Børs Holding was spread out between a large number of owners, the largest being DnB NOR (18%). The Nordic stock exchange group OMX held a 10% stake as well. The company was not publicly listed. In 2008 it merged with Verdipapirsentralen ASA (VPS) to create the new holding company Oslo Børs VPS Holding ASA.

Oslo Børs Holding had two subsidiaries, Oslo Børs ASA that operates the stock exchange and Oslo Børs Informasjon AS that manages the information systems of the exchange.

==Market==
Oslo Børs is today an online market place where all trading is done through computer networks. Trading starts at 09:00am and ends at 04:30pm local time (CET) on all days of the week except weekends and holidays declared by Oslo Børs in advance.

There are three markets for listing and trading on the stock exchange: 
&quot;Oslo Børs&quot; is the largest market place for listing and trading in equities, equity certificates, ETPs (exchange traded funds and notes), derivatives and fixed income products. Established in 1819, first as a commodity exchange. Equities and bonds listed and traded from 1881.

&quot;Oslo Axess&quot; was established in May 2007 as an alternative to Oslo Børs for listing and trading in shares.

&quot;Nordic ABM&quot; was established in June 2005 as an alternative bond market.

&quot;Merkur Market&quot; is a multilateral trading facility and was established in January 2016. The market place is not subject to the Stock Exchange Act or the Stock Exchange Regulations. Merkur Market is best suited for smaller and medium-sized companies or large companies that do not satisfy the admission requirements or do not wish to be fully listed on a regulated market.

==Oslo Access==

Oslo Axess is a regulated and licensed market under the auspices of the Oslo Stock Exchange. The purpose is to promote growth among smaller companies, and give them the benefits achieved by having shares traded on a regulated market.

===General===
Oslo Axess is intended for companies seeking listing on a regulated market, but that does not meet the requirements for listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Oslo Axess operates with the same prices for trade as the Oslo Stock Exchange.

===Licensing===
Oslo Axess has a license from the Ministry of Finance to act as a regulated marketplace for trading in Norway . Basically, the same laws as the Oslo Stock Exchange. The first working day of the Oslo Axess was 2 May 2007.

==Shares==
Norwegian public limited companies and equivalent foreign companies can apply for their shares to be listed on Oslo Børs or Oslo Axess. It is up to the company itself to apply to be admitted to trading, but the company must meet the applicable requirements, which include the number of owners (range), number of shares, market value and history. To be listed the exchange includes strict requirements on the treatment of confidential information.
Companies that meet the requirements for listing can much easier get access to capital through share issues. Many investors only invest in securities listed on a stock exchange, because those papers are easier to sell.

==Indices==
&quot;OBX&quot; – The index comprises the 25 most traded shares listed on Oslo Børs. The OBX index is tradable, meaning that you can buy and sell listed futures and options on the index. Put another way, you can get the same exposure by purchasing an index product as if you buy all the shares (weighted) included in the index. The rating is based on a six-month trading period. The index is adjusted every third Friday in June and December.
&quot;OSEBX&quot; – The Oslo Børs Benchmark Index (Norwegian: Hovedindeks) is an investable index containing a representative selection of all listed shares on Oslo Børs. The OSEBX is revised on a half year basis and the changes are implemented on December 1 and June 1. &quot;OSEFX&quot; – The Oslo Børs Mutual Fund Index (Norwegian: Fondsindeks) has the same constituents as &quot;OSEBX&quot; but applies a weight capping to comply with UCITS.

==Building==
The over 190-year-old stock exchange building has been the subject of many long debates about how the building should be managed and designed over the years. Several of Christiania&#x27;s (the name of Oslo between 1624 and 1925) best known business men fought for years to get approved and funded the construction of a stock exchange in Christiania, the capital of Norway from 1814.

In 1823, a building committee was appointed to consider the various suggested drawings at the time. The committee chose the architect Christian H. Grosch&#x27;s proposal. On July 14, 1826, the Ministry approved the final plans of drawings and budgets. In 1828, it was called Norway&#x27;s first monumental building, completed on the site called Grønningen, the first public park in Christiania.

<text>Borel is a tiny lunar impact crater located in the southeast part of Mare Serenitatis. It was named after French mathematician Émile Borel. To the northeast is the crater Le Monnier and to the southeast is the crater Abetti. Borel was previously identified as Le Monnier C.

This is a roughly circular, cup-shaped formation with inner floors that slope down to the midpoint of the crater. The interior has a higher albedo than the surrounding dark lunar mare.

<text>Catharina is an ancient lunar impact crater located in the southern highlands. It was named after Saint Catherine of Alexandria. It lies in a rugged stretch of land between the Rupes Altai scarp to the west and Mare Nectaris in the east. To the west-northwest is the crater Tacitus, and the lava-flooded Beaumont lies to the east along the shore of Mare Nectaris. To the south-southeast is Polybius.

With the large craters Cyrillus and Theophilus in the north, Catharina forms a prominent grouping that is framed by the curve of the Rupes Altai. Together they form a notable feature when the Sun is at a low angle to the surface. There is also a distinct difference in the ages of these three craters, with the age increasing significantly from north to south.

The rim of Catharina is heavily worn and irregular, with most of the north wall incised by the worn ring of crater Catharina P. The northeast wall is deeply impacted by several smaller craters. No remains on the inner wall, and the outer has been nearly eroded away. The floor is relatively flat but rugged, with a curved ridge formed by Catharina P, and the remains of a smaller crater near the south wall. Nothing remains of a central peak.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Catharina.

==Popular culture==
Within the Sega CD RPG &quot;&quot; (and all subsequent ) there is a region called the Katarina Zone, which is named after the Catharina crater.

<doc id="944317" wikidata="Q3298452" url="?curid=944317" title="Material (band)">
<text>Material was an American band formed in 1979 and operating until 1999, led by producer and bassist Bill Laswell.

The group began in 1978 coalescing at Giorgio Gomelsky&#x27;s Zu House in Manhattan with at its core Laswell, Michael Beinhorn, Fred Maher, Cliff Cultreri and Kramer, acting as a house band for visiting European musicians, such as Daevid Allen. Laswell, Beinhorn, Maher and Cultreri evolved as Material in 1979 first releasing the &quot;Temporary Music&quot; EP, followed by two more albums (&quot;Memory Serves&quot; and &quot;One Down&quot;) with an ever-revolving list of contributors, including singers such as Nona Hendryx, Bernard Fowler and Whitney Houston.

From 1982, the name would be used by Laswell and Beinhorn for many projects, including Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Future Shock&quot; album and &quot;Rockit&quot; single, Timezone&#x27;s &quot;World Destruction&quot; single, and from 1985 onward solely by Laswell such as on Sly and Robbie&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Killers&quot; and Public Image Ltd.&#x27;s &quot;Album&quot;.

Laswell would continue with the name as a front for his own projects up until 1999, releasing four more studio albums (&quot;Seven Souls&quot;, &quot;The Third Power&quot;, &quot;Hallucination Engine&quot; and &quot;Intonarumori&quot;).

==History==
===1978–1979: Formation===
In 1978, having received a substantial royalty payment for his work with The Yardbirds, Georgian music entrepreneur Giorgio Gomelsky relocated to New York City in an attempt to open up the American market to the European progressive jazz-rock bands he was working with, such as Gong, Henry Cow and Magma. He established the Zu Club in Manhattan and after meeting 24-year-old bass player Bill Laswell, encouraged him to form a band. Three young friends, Michael Beinhorn (17, synthesizer), Martin Bisi (17, engineering) and Fred Maher (14, drums), responded to Laswell&#x27;s advert in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and the band began rehearsing in the club&#x27;s basement. They were joined by guitartist Cliff Cultreri and then by organist Mark Kramer, who had befriended Gomelsky while attending a Captain Beefheart concert.

The band became known as the &quot;Zu Band&quot; until Gomelsky hooked them up with former Gong frontman Daevid Allen for a performance at his Zu Manifestival at the Zu Club on October 8, 1978, for which they became &quot;New York Gong&quot;. They were joined at this performance by saxophonist George Bishop and drummer Chris Cutler who were working on Allen&#x27;s &quot;N&#x27;Existe Pas&quot; album, guitarist Michael Lawrence deputised for Cultreri, while Fred Frith guested on some pieces.

Allen returned in March 1979 and the group of Laswell, Beinhorn, Maher, Cultreri and Kramer were joined by drummer Stu Martin and alto-saxophonist Don Davis, a friend of Kramer. They toured North America in an old school bus from April into June playing most of Gong&#x27;s Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy, with Martin departing after a few weeks, his place being taken by another of Kramer&#x27;s friends, Bill Bacon. In autumn, they recorded the album &quot;About Time&quot;, followed by a September and October tour of France, after which Allen and the band amicably parted company when they &quot;discovered they couldn&#x27;t stand the European way of life&quot;.

===1979–1982: The band===
The band then took the name Material, from the Laswell/Cultreri-composed instrumental &quot;Materialism&quot; on the &quot;About Time&quot; album. Their debut recording was 1979&#x27;s instrumental industrial funk &quot;Temporary Music 1&quot; EP for Gomelsky&#x27;s Zu Records. Jean Georgakarakos and Jean-Luc Young had been involved with Allen in Paris since 1969 through their various independent record companies (BYG, Tapioca, LTM and Charly). In the late 1970s Karakos started Celluloid with Jean-François Bizot and Gilbert Castro having initial success in France with Jacno and Toure Kunda. He followed Gomelsky to New York and struck up a partnership with Laswell, Celluloid becoming an outlet for Laswell&#x27;s activity, and Laswell becoming an in-house producer for many of Celluloid&#x27;s other acts. Their first combined output was Material&#x27;s &quot;Discourse&quot; single in 1980.

They were reduced back to the trio of Beinhorn, Laswell and Maher for the 1981 EP &quot;Temporary Music 2&quot; (included Don Davis on saxophone,&quot;White Man&quot;). The departed Cultreri later worked in A&amp;R for Relativity Records where he is credited with bringing Megadeth, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani to the label.

The group would play around New York as a three-piece with a revolving list of “front-men” such as guitarists Sonny Sharrock and Fred Frith, saxophonists Byard Lancaster and Henry Threadgill or cornetist Olu Dara. Laswell explained &quot;We have a lot of directions to pursue, we do get involved in quite a few projects, and we like bringing different people into Material. It&#x27;s healthy for us as players, and it&#x27;s a way of exposing good musicians to new audiences. But even though we&#x27;re fluid, we definitely are a band. And since whatever we play tends to have a strong pulse to it, I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re a rock band... Playing with really strong musicians does change our playing, we improvise and play off one another. We may sound somewhat different, depending on who&#x27;s playing with us, but to me that&#x27;s an advantage.&quot;

The first full album as Material, &quot;Memory Serves&quot;, was instrumental and featured strong jazz leanings with contributions from Sharrock, Frith, Dara, Threadgill and violinist Billy Bang.

They started working with singers and their music became more melodic and funkier. Their next single &quot;Ciquiri&quot; (included on the &quot;American Songs&quot; EP) which featured guitarist Robert Quine, became popular in New York City dance clubs. The 1981 &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; single was released as an extended club mix peaking at number two on the dance charts. On &quot;Busting Out&quot;, they were fronted by singer Nona Hendryx with support from guitarist Ronnie Drayton. This line-up also recorded &quot;It&#x27;s a Holiday&quot; for a split single with Cristina.

By 1982&#x27;s &quot;One Down&quot;, Maher had left the band (he subsequently became a core member of the second incarnation of Scritti Politti), and they embraced a multitude of singers including Nona Hendryx, B.J. Nelson, R. Bernard Fowler and Whitney Houston (in one of her first recordings). Houston&#x27;s performance was a cover version of Hugh Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Memories&quot;, which also featured a lead break by saxophonist Archie Shepp. Critic Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called her contribution &quot;one of the most gorgeous ballads you&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. As an indication of the direction the band headed for, Chic&#x27;s guitarist Nile Rodgers was involved alongside Frith and Drayton, but perhaps more significantly, was one of the first appearances of longtime Laswell collaborator Nicky Skopelitis on guitar.

===1982–1989: Collaborations===
Laswell and Beinhorn settled into a duo and began working with other musicians, producing, writing and performing, with Martin Bisi continuing occasionally as the engineer. They worked initially in the electro genre, but were persuaded to move into the fields of hip-hop and rap by Karakos who had been introduced to likes of turntablist D.St and rappers PHASE 2, Futura 2000 and Fab Five Freddy by Bernard Zekri.

A chance meeting between Laswell and Herbie Hancock at Elektra Records, in which the latter expressed interest in making music in the vein of Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot;, led to a collaboration that brought forth the &quot;Future Shock&quot; album and the hit single &quot;Rockit&quot;. They would collaborate with Hancock on two further albums released under his name, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Sound-System&quot; and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Machine&quot;. Hancock himself would go on to contribute to many of Material and Laswell&#x27;s projects.

In 1984, under the name Timezone, they released the single &quot;World Destruction&quot; which featured disc jockey Afrika Bambaataa and John Lydon (former singer of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd).

In 1985 Laswell and Beinhorn parted company. Beinhorn went into record production for the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Marilyn Manson. Laswell retained the Material name and was calling upon a large group of musicians with, at its core, guitarist Skopelitis, keyboardist Jeff Bova, percussionist Aiyb Dieng, former Parliament-Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell and bassist Bootsy Collins, plus Jamaican reggae duo Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare (Sly and Robbie).

===1989–1999: Projects===
By 1989, Laswell had ceased using the Material name as an umbrella for his own activities and began to use it as a front for specific projects. The first of these projects was the album &quot;Seven Souls&quot;, featuring William S. Burroughs reading portions of his novel &quot;The Western Lands&quot;. In 1998, the album was subject to a series of re-mixes by Laswell, Talvin Singh, Spring Heel Jack, DJ Olive and released as &quot;The Road to the Western Lands&quot;.

&quot;The Third Power&quot; was released in 1991, with duo Sly and Robbie and Bootsy Collins being Laswell&#x27;s main collaborators. Vocal performances were given by the Jungle Brothers&#x27; Baby Bam and Mike G, The Last Poets&#x27;s Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin, and Shabba Ranks. Other musicians included members of Funkadelic, Herbie Hancock, Henry Threadgill and Olu Dara.

1993&#x27;s &quot;Hallucination Engine&quot; was a fusion of jazz, Indian and Middle Eastern influences. Noted jazz players included Wayne Shorter, Jonas Hellborg, and from John McLaughlin&#x27;s Shakti tabla player Zakir Hussain, violinist L. Shankar and Vikku Vinayakram (on ghatam). Palestinian violinist Simon Shaheen, Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu, and William S. Burroughs also contributed. &quot;Mantra&quot;, an 8-minute track from the album, was given a 17-minute remix by The Orb for the 12&quot; single.

The final release under the name Material was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Intonarumori&quot;. Sub-titled &quot;Rap is still an art&quot;, it featured contributions from Rammellzee, Kool Keith, Flavor Flav and Killah Priest.

Laswell has on occasion used the name for live performances, the last being at the Bonnaroo Music Festival on June 13, 2004 with, among others, his wife Gigi, drummer Bryan &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia and guitarist Buckethead (both from Laswell&#x27;s other project, Praxis).

On 5 April 2005, Laswell performed a 2-hour concert at WTTW Studios, Chicago with three incarnations of his groups: Tabla Beat Science (with Zakir Hussein, Ustad Sultan Khan, DJ Disk, Karsh Kale, Selim Merchant and Nils Petter Molvaer), Material (with Pharoah Sanders, Foday Musa Suso, Hamid Drake, Aïyb Dieng and Abegasu Shiota) and Praxis (with Buckethead, Brian &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia and Toshinori Kondo), with Bootsy Collins performing MC duties at its climax. An hour long edit was broadcast on the Soundstage series on 13 July 2006.

<text>Ching-Te is a small lunar impact crater located in a mountainous area to the east of the Mare Serenitatis. It is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with no distinguishing features.

To the south-southeast is the crater Fabbroni, and to the northeast is Littrow. North of Ching-Te is the Rimae Littrow rille system as well as the crater Clerke. Between Ching-Te and Mons Argaeus to the southwest lies the tiny crater Stella, with a bright ray system.

In the Taurus–Littrow valley about 20 kilometers to the east is the landing site of the Apollo 17 expedition.

The name of the crater was proposed by Dr. Farouk El-Baz and approved by the IAU in 1976.

<text>Planing ( ) is the mode of operation for a waterborne craft in which its weight is predominantly supported by hydrodynamic lift, rather than hydrostatic lift (buoyancy).

Many forms of marine transport make use of planing, including fast ferries, racing boats, seaplanes, and water skis. Most surfboards are planing or semi-planing hulls. Beyond planing, fast vessel designs have seen a transition to hydrofoil designs.

==History==
The earliest documented planing sailboat was a proa built in 1898 by Commodore Ralph Munroe. It was capable of speeds of more than twice the hull speed.

Planing a sailing dinghy was first popularised by Uffa Fox in Britain. In 1928 Fox introduced planing to the racing world in his International 14 dinghy, &quot;Avenger&quot;. That year he gained 52 first places, 2 seconds, and 3 third places out of 57 race starts.

This performance was noticed by other designers who further developed them. Over the years, many dinghies have acquired the ability to plane. Materials advances have allowed for lighter boats that will plane faster and in lighter air. There are now many high-performance dinghies (sometimes called skiffs) that can plane to windward.

==How planing works==
At rest, a vessel&#x27;s weight is borne entirely by the buoyant force. Every hull acts as a displacement hull at low speeds: the buoyant force is mainly responsible for supporting the craft. As speed increases, hydrodynamic lift increases, and the buoyant force decreases as the hull lifts out of the water, decreasing the displaced volume. At some speed, lift becomes the predominant upward force on the hull and the vessel is planing.

A simple model of this effect is a solid slab of material that is heavier than water (like a steel plate) but is shaped and oriented to have a positive angle of attack. At rest, the slab will sink because it is heavier than water; the buoyant forces are overwhelmed by the force of gravity. However, if the slab is kept in the same orientation and pulled horizontally through the water, it will force the incoming water downward. This results in a reactionary force upward on the slab. At a high enough speed, this reactionary force (plus any small buoyant force) is larger than the force of gravity and the slab will stay afloat. In this way, the horizontal force (which may be supplied by a motor or a sail) is converted into a vertical force upwards. The concept of planing is often interpreted as analogous with aerodynamic lift (See lift on an airfoil). In reality the acting forces are different.

Although any hull will plane if enough power is provided and enough speed is attained, a hull designed for operation in the planing realm is &quot;sometimes&quot; distinguished by a flat run aft. In other words, in side view, the bottom is more or less a straight line towards the stern. (Exceptions to this include surfboards and other recreational planing hulls, which utilize rocker throughout for enhanced maneuverability when banking through turns.) In contrast, in a displacement, or non-planing hull, the bottom is curved in side view (the curvature is called &quot;rocker&quot;) all the way from bow to stern, in order to minimize wave drag. In front view, the sections in the aft area may be straight, as in a racing hydroplane, to maximize planing forces and speed, but for practical reasons of stability and comfortable ride are often V-shaped, especially in boats intended for offshore use.

To plane, especially to initiate planing, the power-to-weight ratio must be high, since the planing mode of operation involves moving the hull at speeds higher than its natural hull speed. All boat designs for planing benefit from minimised weight; planing powerboats are commonly made from light alloy or use other reduced-weight construction techniques- RIBs are typical examples. Planing sailing boats need a good sail area and powerboats need a high-power engine. Steps and chine ridges may also be incorporated into the design to encourage both ease of planing and stability.

Most surfboards, although unpowered, are planing or semi-planing hulls. They utilize the push of the waveform more or less in combination with gravity and specific angles of attack for the hydrofoil to maximise propulsive force and reduce the net downforce and thus achieve planing lift.

== Sailing techniques used to promote planing==

Planing may be achieved in most sailing dinghies. In light to moderate conditions, planing is best initiated by a combination of the following.
*Maximise power: sail on a reach or broad reach to begin.
*Minimise surface-induced drag: raise the centreboard or daggerboard about halfway
*Maintain power: when a gust hits, bear away slightly and ease the sheets
*As a gust begins to pass, steer slightly to windward to keep the apparent wind forward
*Maintain flat form of immersed sections of hull: keep the hull level side-to-side, trapeze if necessary
*Move your weight aft to lift the bow
*Maintain power if necessary: flick or pump the sails (although there are some restrictions on doing this in a race)
*Seek optimal form and speed of immersed hull: if there are waves, surf down them to initiate planing.

<text>Hurricane Keith was a powerful tropical cyclone that formed in September 2000, it caused extensive damage in Central America, especially in Mexico and Belize. It was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season. Keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on September 28. The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the following day. As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 30. Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane less than 24 hours later. Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction. By late on October 2, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker, Belize as a minimal hurricane. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early on the following day. While moving inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October 4. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on the following day. By late on October 5, Keith made its third and final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico as a moderately strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24 hours after landfall.

Keith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in Central America, which resulted in extensive flooding, especially in Belize and Mexico. In Guatemala, the storm flooded 10 towns, and caused one fatality. Similarly, one fatality also occurred in El Salvador, and at least 300 people were affected by flooding in that country. Thirteen communities in Nicaragua were completely isolated after Keith made roads impassable. Twelve deaths were reported in Nicaragua, all of which were flood-related. Five people were presumed dead in Honduras after an aircraft disappeared near Roatán; one other fatality occurred due to flooding. The storm brought torrential rainfall to Belize, with many areas reporting at least of rain, while highest reported amount of precipitation was greater than . In Belize, a village reported that only 12 houses remained, while elsewhere in the country, at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged; several houses in Belize City suffered minor roof damage. At least 19 people were killed in Belize and damages totaled to $280 million (2000 USD). Heavy rainfall also occurred in Mexico, especially in the states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. Flooding from Keith caused several mudslides and a few rivers reached historic levels. Throughout Mexico, at least 460 houses were damaged or destroyed and other losses in infrastructure occurred. In addition, one person drowned due to heavy rainfall. Damages incurred in associated with Keith in Mexico totaled to approximately $365.9 million (2000 MXN, $38.7 million 2000 USD). Overall, Keith was responsible for 68 deaths and $319 million (2000 USD) in damage.

==Meteorological history==

On September 16, 2000, a tropical wave – an elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west – exited the west coast of Africa. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development due to the presence of upper-level wind shear. After moving across the Caribbean Sea, a disturbance along the wave started to become better organized on September 27. The next day, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated a closed circulation and winds of ; upon receiving the data, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Fifteen at 2100 UTC. The NHC later estimated the depression had formed three hours earlier, about north-northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. Upon forming, the depression had good outflow, although the convection was not as organized. With an anticyclone over the system, the depression was expected to gradually intensify while moving slowly to the west-northwest, a motion caused by weak steering winds. Late on September 28, the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status and named it Keith, after another Hurricane Hunters mission reported flight-level winds of .
By the time Keith became a tropical storm, it was beginning to undergo rapid deepening, fueled by warm waters, low wind shear, and an organizing cloud pattern. There initially was uncertainty in the storm&#x27;s future movement, due to a ridge in the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclone prediction models differed on their assessments; three models anticipated a turn to the northeast toward Florida due to a trough, while others predicted a continued slow motion to the west-northwest, eventually reaching the Bay of Campeche. After continued strengthening, Keith became a hurricane on September 30, just 18 hours after becoming a tropical storm, and making it the seventh such storm of that intensity of the season. That day, an eye began developing as the structure became much better organized. In a 13‑hour period beginning at 1808 UTC on September 30, Keith underwent explosive deepening, as its barometric pressure dropped at a rate of nearly per hour. The NHC noted that Keith experienced conditions &quot;ideal for strengthening&quot;, with the exception of the approaching land interaction with the Yucatán peninsula. The hurricane slowed until stalling offshore eastern Belize, caused by the ridge to the north and the precursor to Tropical Storm Leslie forming over Cuba. By early on October 1, Keith had developed a well-defined eye about in diameter, with what the NHC described as a &quot;spectacular appearance.&quot; Later that day, Hurricane Hunters estimated a minimum pressure of and deployed a dropsonde that observed peak winds of . Based on the data, the NHC estimated that Keith attained peak winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) at 0700 UTC on October 1, while just offshore eastern Belize. This made it a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

Shortly after Keith reached peak intensity, the eye had moved over portions of Belize, causing it to lose definition. Outflow became restricted, and the developing disturbance to the northeast increased wind shear. As a result, Keith began to weaken steadily on October 1. While remaining nearly stationary, Keith made a landfall on Ambergris Caye late on October 2 as a minimal hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Keith weakened into a tropical storm, and its convection became limited to the southeastern quadrant. At 0300 UTC, the storm made its second landfall about north of Belize City, and within nine hours weakened into a tropical depression. The building ridge to the north caused the system to accelerate more to the west-northwest across the Yucatán peninsula. Early on October 4, Keith emerged into the Bay of Campeche, where favorable conditions allowed convection to quickly redevelop. Later that day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm, with improved outflow and convective organization. On October 5, the Hurricane Hunters reported a circular eye had reformed along with winds supporting an upgrade to hurricane status. Keith intensified further that day, until it made its final landfall north of Tampico with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). It rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern Mexico, dissipating late on October 6.

==Preparations==
On September 29, shortly after Keith formed, a hurricane watch was issued for the Yucatán Peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24 hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.

On October 2, the government of Belize declared a state of emergency and activated the entire Belize Defence Force due to the storm&#x27;s threat. The airport in Belize City was closed during Keith&#x27;s passage, limiting transportation from the country&#x27;s mainland to its offshore islands. In Corozal, Belize, authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000 people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk. Officials were also ordered evacuations for Belize City, setting up shelters in Belmopan. Overall, about 25,000 people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize&#x27;s population. Three hospitals were evacuated in the country. In a post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did not anticipate such intensity.

In Quintana Roo, 5,000 people from Chetumal and surrounding low-lying areas were forced to evacuate to 30 shelters. Offshore along a coral reef, about 50 fishermen stayed on a coral reef during the storm. In the Bay of Campeche, Pemex evacuated about 6,300 workers from its offshore oil platforms. Officials in Yucatán and Veracruz declared states of emergency. When Keith reached the Gulf of Mexico and began re-intensifying, a hurricane warning was issued from Tuxpan to Matamoros in northeastern Mexico, with a tropical storm watch issued northward to Port Mansfield, Texas. About 3,000 residents in Tamaulipas evacuated to 250 shelters, and in neighboring Veracruz, about 175 people left their houses before the storm struck. The threat of Hurricane Keith caused Mexican authorities to close most ports along the gulf coast, and many schools in the area were closed.

==Impact==

Keith&#x27;s slow and erratic movement caused it to produce strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central America. Belize bore the brunt of the storm, with about $280 million in damage and 19 confirmed fatalities, primarily related to flooding. Several other countries reported significant but less severe flooding, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths, as well as approximately $319 million in damage.

===Belize===

While Keith was offshore from Belize, northerly winds blew water out of the Bay of Chetumal. There were reports of people walking onto the temporarily dry bay floor, despite the potential for the waters to return in the event of shifting winds. At Caye Caulker, the hurricane produced a storm surge from the west. Winds were unofficially estimated to have reached in the offshore islands of Belize. Wind gusts on the mainland reached at Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport. Due to its slow motion, Keith dropped heavy rainfall, amounting to over in many parts of the country. The highest recorded precipitation total was at the international airport in Belize City.

The strong winds destroyed 130 houses in Belize. Two hotel roofs were wrecked, and the winds knocked down trees and power lines. Widespread areas of Belize lost power and telephone service, including Belize City. There, the heavy rainfall flooded streets, reaching deep. Twenty homes were damaged to some degree in the capital, while many more suffered minor roof damage. The rains flooded the first floor of the primary hospital in the city, causing severe damage. Nationwide, 11 health facilities were damaged. Elsewhere in the country, the rains increased levels along rivers, including the Belize River, Rio Hondo, and New River. The Belize River rose for several days after the storm, reaching record levels of 21 ft (6.6 m) in width, which isolated 15 villages. Flooding covered Northern Highway and Western Highway as well as the primary bridge from Belmopan to the rest of Cayo District. Residual floodwaters persisted due to the low-lying land of the country and poor drainage. Floods contaminated water supply in the northern four districts, causing an E. coli outbreak and food poisoning. In Belize, Corozal, and Orange Walk districts, about 30% of the houses were severely damaged by flooding.

Damage was heaviest in the northern offshore islands and in the northern portion of the mainland. On the offshore islands, downed trees and power lines blocked most roads. In Caye Caulker and San Pedro, Keith damaged the roofs of about 90% of houses and damaged or destroyed 676 houses, leaving 3,279 people homeless. About 50% of the houses in Caye Caulker were destroyed, In San Pedro, about 30% of houses, or at least 50, were wrecked. On Ambergris Caye, four airplanes were destroyed. At Turneffe Atoll, about 35% of the landmass was affected, with many trees in that section uprooted and numerous tree branches snapped.

Five individuals died in maritime accidents involving at least one catamaran. There was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees, killing four people on board. Three people died on the offshore Ambergris Caye. Overall, 19 people perished in the country. Several injuries, mainly from flying debris, were reported in San Pedro, and there were 142 people who were injured in the storm. Throughout the country, approximately 3,279 homes were either damaged or destroyed. The damage total from Keith was initially estimated at $200 million, about half of which was to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage. About 75% of the crops in the country were damaged, including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in October. The damage total was later estimated at $280 million, most of it on the offshore Ambergris Cay and Caye Caulker.

===Mexico===
Hurricane Keith caused damage in three Mexican states – Quintana Roo along the Yucatán Peninsula, Tamaulipas where the hurricane made landfall, and Sonora farther inland. In Quintana Roo, Keith left $2.7 million (2000 MXN, $294,000 2000 USD) in damage, and caused an additional $39.7 million (2000 MXN, $4.2 million 2000 USD) in indirect costs. While crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Keith dropped heavy rainfall, including over in Campeche state. Chetumal, Quintana Roo reported of precipitation.

When Keith made its final landfall, Tampico reported tropical storm force winds, with gusts to . The winds damaged billboards and some trees in the city, and elsewhere along the coast, Keith knocked down trees and power lines. About 200,000 people in northeastern Mexico lost power, and 100,000 people were left without water. About 400 houses were damaged in Veracruz, and many roads and bridges were destroyed. Heavy rainfall occurred in the interior of northeastern Mexico, peaking at in González, Tamaulipas. In a reporting station in the municipality of Gómez Farías, the pluviometer reported a 24-hour rain total of , and a storm total of , which broke the precipitation record for that location, which counted with 35 years of data. This rain also caused rivers to reach record levels, as the Sabinas River rose on October 6, to a new historical peak, and the Guayalejo River rose , slightly under the 1976 record. This rainfall caused the Las Ánimas dam to catch of water between October 5 and October 17; however, some of this water had to be released, as the upstream face of the dam was damaged by debris, and had to be repaired. Overall, the storm produced $117.8 million in damage (2000 MXN, $12.4 million 2000 USD) in the state.

In Nuevo León, the remnants of Keith interacted with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall, reaching in Sabinas. The average precipitation in the state was , and the deluge caused causing mudslides in several cities, including San Pedro, Guadalupe and Escobedo. High rainfall also caused flash flood in mountainous areas near Monterrey, forming swift river currents that rose up to 9,000 ft³/s (250 m³/s), and dragged 130 people into local rivers; however, all were rescued. The rivers also dragged 30 vehicles, all of which were moderate to total losses. The storm runoff caused the El Cuchillo dam to receive of water daily, and the La Boca dam to receive per hour. About 13,000 residents lost power. About 5,000 people were forced evacuated from several municipalities in the state, including 2,465 from Monterrey and 1,900 from rural areas, at a cost of $400,000 (2000 MXN). The total damages in the state rose to $115.6 million (2000 MXN, US$12.2 million in year 2000), with the damage to urban infrastructure being the most expensive portion of the damage, with $44.2 million (2000 MXN, US$4.6 million in 2000) used to repair damage in eight municipalities; in particular, San Pedro Garza García received approximately three quarters of the infrastructure damage, with $30.8 million (2000 MXN, $3.3 million 2000 USD). Additionally, about 460 homes were damaged or destroyed, and 300 families had to be relocated to safer areas.
In other states, damage was lighter, but still significant. In Sonora, total damages rose to $64.4 million (2000 MXN, $6.8 million 2000 USD); in Chiapas, $25.6 million (2000 MXN, $2.7 million 2000 USD) of property damage were caused by the storm. This brings up the total damage in Mexico to $365.9 million (2000 MXN, $38.7 million 2000 USD). In Tabasco, flooding damaged 7,896 houses. Approximately 24,000 residents in the state were impacted by flooding. At the capital city of Villahermosa, large rivers in the area overflowed, flooding some streets. However, dikes and sandbags along the banks of the rivers prevented further flooding. Overall, about 46,000 people had to evacuate Mexico due to the storm and its flooding. There was one fatality when a man in Tampico was electrocuted by a downed power line. In Xicoténcatl, Tamaulipas, a swollen river killed a family of six when their house was flooded. Overall, Keith killed 23 people in Mexico – 13 in Veracruz, 4 in Puebla, and 6 in Tamaulipas. There were six indirect deaths when a plane crashed while attempting to land in Reynosa, Tamaulipas.

===Elsewhere===
The outer bands of Keith brought intermittent rainfall to several areas of Cuba, though the amounts were very light. While Keith was organizing, the storm drew moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean across Central America, producing heavy rainfall. In Guatemala, the rains caused flooding in ten towns and inundated approximately 500 farms in the Melchor de Mencos municipality with about of water. Additionally, one fatality was reported. Governor of Petén Department Adán Regalado remarked that, &quot;many communities are cut off by flooded rivers&quot;. In El Salvador, a 20-year-old man drowned in a river, and 200 families had to evacuate after several houses were damaged or destroyed. Rainfall in Honduras forced over 200 families to evacuate their houses. One person died when a wall collapsed, and there were five other fatalities an aircraft disappeared near Roatan Island. A bridge along the Pan-American Highway between Honduras and Nicaragua was destroyed, which had been rebuilt following Hurricane Mitch. Additionally, a government agency reported that as many as 80,000 people in southern Honduras were left isolated.

In Nicaragua, floods from the storm forced 3,962 people to evacuate their houses to 57 shelters, many of which were schools. Floods affected 11 of the 17 Departments of Nicaragua, which began receding on October 5 as Keith exited the region. The floods caused several landslides and covered roads, which isolated communities. Keith damaged 436 houses in the country and destroyed another 160. There were 12 fatalities due to the storm in Nicaragua, one of whom a boy who was swept away by a fast moving flooded river northeast of Managua, while another death occurred after a man drowned in Lake Managua. A man in the western portions of the country died after stepping on a power lines, which had fallen due to strong winds. Fifty communities were isolated, with at least thirteen of them due to impassable roads. Several neighborhoods in Corinto flooded, forcing the Civil Defense to evacuate 9 families. One house collapsed in Los Ángeles, though its ten occupants escaped without injury. After rainfall lashed in Villanueva, Chinandega, for six days, the resultant flooding forced 300 families evacuated, while there was significant losses the corn, beans and plantains crops. An additional 20 families left their homes due to flooding in Poneloya. About 15 families in the port city of Puerto Sandino were evacuated after the El Contrabando river overflowed. Another 18 homes were flooded in the region of Salinas Grandes. About 52 fled Troilo after at least 11 homes flooded.

==Aftermath==

On October 3, a Belize ambassador issued an appeal to the international community for food and money due to the damage from Keith. United Nations Development Programme received $30,000 from the Government of Norway to give immediate relief to the country of Belize. United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund also gave out $150,000 for relief in areas not focused on by other relief groups. The Peace Corps, the Red Cross, and the United States Navy black hawk helicopters worked together to deliver rice, corn, sugar, salt, cooking oil, toilet paper, and medications to about 700 families in Bermuda Landings and adjacent isolated villages. The American Red Cross donated about $28,500 and 4,080 family hygiene kits. Between October and November 2000, the National Society distributed 5,289 food and hygiene parcels to 26,293 people in Belize City, Orange Walk, and Belmopan. Around that time, the Belize Red Cross Society (BRCS) distributed relief items to 4,622 victims in Belize City. The BRCS also shipped two containers with kitchen sets and water buckets for 1,600 families, donated by the German Red Cross. A donation account to help the relief effort, titled &quot;Hurricane Keith Relief Fund&quot;, was set up by the town of Placencia, in the local Atlantic Bank. The Belize Consulate in California also set up a donation fundraiser. Placencia also delivered a boat full of donated food, clothing, and building supplies to the San Pedro and Caye Caulker area.

In the immediate aftermath, officials enacted a curfew for Belize City, Caye Caulker and San Pedro to curtail looting, and the latter two areas were declared disaster areas. The entirety of the northern three districts (out of six total) were also declared disaster areas. There were initial difficulties in determining the needs in the affected residents, due to cut communications. The government sent planes with emergency supplies to the most affected offshore islands. Several emergency teams were sent to Caye Caulker and San Pedro as soon as weather conditions permitted it. Widespread road repairs also began almost immediately after Keith&#x27;s occurrence. The Belize International Airport was back online by the morning of October 4, only a single day after the tropical cyclone passed through the area. By that time, boat service was re-instated with the most affected areas to pick up stranded tourists. Workers quickly restored power and water in Belize City. In the days after the storm struck, residual flooding sparked fears for the spread of disease. In Orange Walk and Cayo District, residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid bites from poisonous snakes.

In Nicaragua, the United States ambassador declared a disaster, which prompted various United Nations departments to provide $25,000 to the country.

Due to the hurricane&#x27;s high impact, the name &quot;Keith&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2001 and it will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. The name was replaced with &quot;Kirk&quot; for the 2006 season.

<text>Dave Hernandez (born September 20, 1970, Guadalajara, Mexico) is a Mexican guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is best known as a former member of the American indie rock band The Shins, with whom he recorded four studio albums. Hernandez is currently the guitarist of the post-punk band The Intelligence, and is the former vocalist and guitarist of the punk band Scared of Chaka.

Hernandez met Shins frontman James Mercer when both lived in Albuquerque playing in underground bands in the early/mid 1990s. Hernandez&#x27;s punk band Scared of Chaka and Mercer&#x27;s indie pop band Flake were both part of the thriving Albuquerque independent rock scene that spawned bands like The Drags, The Rondelles, and Henrys Dress.

Among the other bands Hernandez has played in are Broadcast Oblivion, The Charming Snakes, and The Boskos. He has played guitar on records by Big Business and Sean Na Na. He is currently the frontman for Seattle garage band Little Cuts and guitarist for The Intelligence.

==Biography==

===Departing The Shins and joining The Intelligence (2011-present)===
Despite his and his bandmates&#x27; departure from The Shins, frontman James Mercer, invited both Hernandez and Crandall to perform on the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Port of Morrow&quot; (2012), as session musicians. Frontman James Mercer noted: &quot;Well, I liked what they do. So I called them up and asked them. I had a number of things that I really thought Dave would sound good on. Dave Hernandez has a certain sound, tone, and style, and he comes up with ideas that you really don’t get anywhere else.&quot;

In 2011, Hernandez joined the post-punk band The Intelligence, with whom he was briefly a member in 2003. With the band he has recorded two studio albums, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got It Easy But Me&quot; (2012) and &quot;Vintage Future&quot; (2015).

<doc id="944330" wikidata="Q17091385" url="?curid=944330" title="Jesse Sandoval">
<text>Jesse Sandoval (born November 15, 1974) is the former drummer of American indie rock group The Shins. Sandoval initially formed Flake with singer-songwriter James Mercer, guitarist Neal Langford and bassist Marty Crandall in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1992. Sandoval and Mercer then went on to form The Shins as a side project, intending to play as a duo, but were eventually joined again by Marty Crandall on keyboard and Dave Hernandez on bass. Sandoval, along with other band members, later moved to Portland, Oregon.

In 2009, Sandoval was dismissed from the Shins along with longtime members Crandall and Hernandez. Mercer described the move as an &quot;aesthetic decision&quot;, and later explained &quot;I try not to think about it as a firing as much as a new phase in the process.&quot; Sandoval gave his side of the story in an interview with the &quot;Portland Mercury&quot;, stating that he &quot;unequivocally got fired&quot; but did not bear Mercer any ill will.

After leaving the Shins, Sandoval opened a food cart in Portland, &quot;Nuevo Mexico&quot;, where he serves traditional New Mexican food, including stuffed sopaipillas. He drew upon his experience helping in his mother&#x27;s food cart, which worked festivals in New Mexico.

Jesse made an appearance on Darren Hanlon&#x27;s album &quot;Fingertips &amp; Mountaintops&quot;.

<doc id="944332" wikidata="Q752333" url="?curid=944332" title="Tom and Jerry (drink)">
<text>A Tom and Jerry is a traditional Christmas-time cocktail in the United States, sometimes attributed to British writer and professional boxing journalist Pierce Egan in the 1820s. It is a variant of eggnog with brandy and rum added and served hot, usually in a mug or a bowl.

Another method uses egg whites, beaten stiff, with the yolks and sugar folded back in, and optionally vanilla extract added. A few spoonfuls are added to a mug, then hot milk and rum are added, and it is topped with nutmeg. Pre-made Tom and Jerry batter, typically produced by manufacturers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Montana, is sold in regional supermarkets during the Christmas season.

==Name==
The drink&#x27;s name is a reference to Egan&#x27;s book, &quot;Life in London, or The Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn Esq. and his Elegant Friend Corinthian Tom&quot; (1821), and the subsequent stage play &quot;Tom and Jerry, or Life in London&quot; (also 1821). To publicize the book and the play, Egan introduced a variation of eggnog by adding of brandy, calling it a &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. The additional fortification helped popularize the drink.

==In popular culture==
Tom and Jerry was a favorite of President Warren G. Harding, who served it at an annual Christmas party for his closest friends.

Two later cartoon duos, a short-lived Tom and Jerry from Van Beuren Studios in the 1930s, and the famous cat and mouse rivalry from the 1940s through the 1960s, also bore the name, possibly as a play on words with the drink or the literary works that inspired it.

The Tom and Jerry serves as the main device in the story &quot;I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas&quot; by Yogi Yorgesson, in which Yogi drinks a dozen rounds of the beverage and is thus hung over for the following day&#x27;s Christmas dinner.

<text>Sepang International Circuit () (known as [[Petronas]] Sepang International Circuit for commercial reasons) is a motorsport race track in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. It is located approximately south of Kuala Lumpur, close to Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It hosted the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix between 1999 and 2017, and is also the venue for the Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix, the Malaysia Merdeka Endurance Race, and other major motorsport events. Previously known as the Sepang F1 Circuit, it was renamed the Sepang International Circuit. On 31 October 2023, it was announced that Petronas has acquired the naming rights to the circuit for three years in an undisclosed fee.

==History==
The circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke, who would subsequently design circuits including in Shanghai, Sakhir, Istanbul, Marina Bay, and Yas Marina. As part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad&#x27;s government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. The Malaysian climate means the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace-hot days to tropical rain-storms.

The circuit was officially inaugurated by the 4th Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad on 7 March 1999 at 20:30 MST (UTC+08:00). He subsequently went on to inaugurate the first Moto GP Malaysian Grand Prix on 20 April 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix) and the first Formula One Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix on 17 October 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix).

On 23 October 2011, on the second lap of the MotoGP Shell Advance Malaysian Grand Prix, the Italian motorcycle racer Marco Simoncelli died following a crash in turn 11 on Lap 2, resulting in an abandonment of the race.

The track was completely resurfaced in 2016 with the support of italian designers Dromo, with several corners reprofiled to emphasize mechanical, rather than aerodynamic grip. Notably, the final corner was raised by approximately 1 meter, which officials claimed would force drivers to take a later apex and explore different racing lines through the hairpin.

In October 2016 it was rumored that the Sepang circuit may be dropped from the Formula One calendar due to dwindling ticket sales, and held its nineteenth and last World Championship Grand Prix in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com/sport&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The race&#x27;s contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales.

==Layout==

The main circuit, normally raced in a clockwise direction, is long, and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights from . The layout is quite unusual, with a long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin.

Other configurations of the Sepang circuit can also be used. The north circuit is also raced in a clockwise direction. It is basically the first half of the main circuit. The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is long in total.

The south circuit is the other half of the racecourse. The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight when the south circuit is in use, and joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn. Also run clockwise, this circuit is in length.

Sepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities.

===Track configurations===

==A lap in a Formula One car==

Sepang starts with a long pit straight where the DRS zone exists – crucial for drivers to get a good exit out of the last corner to gain as much speed as possible. Turn 1 is a very long, slow corner taken in second gear. Most drivers brake incredibly late and lose speed gradually as they file round the corner, similar to Shanghai&#x27;s first turn but slower. Turn 1 leads straight into Turn 2, a tight left hairpin which goes downhill quite significantly. The first two corners are quite bumpy, making it hard to put power onto the track. Turn 3 is a long flat out right hander which leads into Turn 4 – known locally as the Langkawi Curve – a second gear, right-angle right-hander. Turns 5 and 6 make up an incredibly high-speed, long chicane that hurts tyres and puts a lot of stress on drivers due to high G-Force. It is locally known as the Genting Curve. Turns 7 and 8 (the KLIA curve) make up a long, medium-speed, double-apex right hander, and a bump can cause the car to lose balance here. Turn 9 is a very slow left-hand hairpin (the Berjaya Tioman Corner), similar to turn two but uphill. Turn 10 leads into a challenging, medium-speed right hander at turn 11, requiring braking and turning simultaneously. Turn 12 is a flat-out, bumpy left which immediately leads into the flat right at turn 13, then the challenging &#x27;Sunway Lagoon&#x27; curve at turn 14. Similar to turn 11, it requires hard-braking and steering at the same time. It is taken in second gear. The long back straight can be a good place for drivers to overtake as they brake hard into turn 15, a left-handed, second-geared hairpin but drivers are advised by experts to be careful not to get re-overtaken as they come into turn 1.

<doc id="944339" wikidata="Q263125" url="?curid=944339" title="Fibre-reinforced plastic">
<text>Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP; also called fibre-reinforced polymer, or in American English &quot;fiber&quot;) is a composite material made of a polymer matrix reinforced with fibres. The fibres are usually glass (in fibreglass), carbon (in carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer), aramid, or basalt. Rarely, other fibres such as paper, wood, boron, or asbestos have been used. The polymer is usually an epoxy, vinyl ester, or polyester thermosetting plastic, though phenol formaldehyde resins are still in use.

FRPs are commonly used in the aerospace, automotive, marine, and construction industries. They are commonly found in ballistic armour and cylinders for self-contained breathing apparatuses.

==History==
Bakelite was the first fibre-reinforced plastic. Leo Baekeland had originally set out to find a replacement for shellac (made from the excretion of lac bugs). Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were polymers, and Baekeland investigated the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde. He first produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called &quot;Novolak&quot; that never became a market success, then turned to developing a binder for asbestos which, at that time, was moulded with rubber. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to phenol and formaldehyde, he found in 1905 he could produce his dreamed of hard mouldable material (the world&#x27;s first synthetic plastic): bakelite. He announced his invention at a meeting of the American Chemical Society on 5 February 1909.

The development of fibre-reinforced plastic for commercial use was being extensively researched in the 1930s. In the United Kingdom, considerable research was undertaken by pioneers such as Norman de Bruyne. It was particularly of interest to the aviation industry.

Mass production of glass strands was discovered in 1932, when Games Slayter, a researcher at Owens-Illinois accidentally directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibres. A patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933.
Owens joined with the Corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by Owens Corning to produce its patented &quot;fibreglas&quot; (one &quot;s&quot;) in 1936. Originally, fibreglas was a glass wool with fibres entrapping a great deal of gas, making it useful as an insulator, especially at high temperatures.

A suitable resin for combining the &quot;fibreglas&quot; with a plastic to produce a composite material, was developed in 1936 by du Pont. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is Cyanamid&#x27;s resin of 1942. Peroxide curing systems were used by then. With the combination of fibreglas and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic. This reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic, but now for the first time the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material. Confusingly, many glass fibre composites continued to be called &quot;fibreglass&quot; (as a generic name) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic.

Ray Greene of Owens Corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937, but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used. In 1939, Russia was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials, and the United States a fuselage and wings of an aircraft. The first car to have a fibre-glass body was the 1946 Stout Scarab. Only one of this model was built. The Ford prototype of 1941 could have been the first plastic car, but there is some uncertainty around the materials used as it was destroyed shortly afterwards.
The first fibre-reinforced plastic plane was either the Fairchild F-46, first flown on 12 May 1937, or the Californian built Bennett Plastic Plane. A fibreglass fuselage was used on a modified Vultee BT-13A designated the XBT-16 based at Wright Field in late 1942. In 1943, further experiments were undertaken building structural aircraft parts from composite materials resulting in the first plane, a Vultee BT-15, with a GFRP fuselage, designated the XBT-19, being flown in 1944. A significant development in the tooling for GFRP components had been made by Republic Aviation Corporation in 1943.

Carbon fibre production began in the late 1950s and was used, though not widely in British industry until the early 1960s. Aramid fibres were being produced around this time also, appearing first under the trade name Nomex by DuPont. Today, each of these fibres is used widely in industry for any applications that require plastics with specific strength or elastic qualities. Glass fibres are the most common across all industries, although carbon-fibre and carbon-fibre-aramid composites are widely found in aerospace, automotive and sporting good applications. These three (glass, carbon, and aramid) continue to be the important categories of fibre used in FRP.

Global polymer production on the scale present today began in the mid 20th century, when low material and productions costs, new production technologies and new product categories, combined to make polymer production economical. The industry finally matured in the late 1970s, when world polymer production surpassed that of steel, making polymers the ubiquitous material that they are today. Fibre-reinforced plastics have been a significant aspect of this industry from the beginning.

==Process definition==
A polymer is generally manufactured by step-growth polymerization or addition polymerization. When one or more polymers are combined with various agents to enhance or in any way alter their material properties, the result is referred to as a plastic. Composite plastics refers to those types of plastics that result from bonding two or more homogeneous materials with different material properties to derive a final product with certain desired material and mechanical properties. Fibre-reinforced plastics are a category of composite plastics that specifically use fibre materials to mechanically enhance the strength and elasticity of plastics.

The original plastic material without fibre reinforcement is known as the matrix or binding agent. The matrix is a tough but relatively weak plastic that is reinforced by stronger stiffer reinforcing filaments or fibres. The extent that strength and elasticity are enhanced in a fibre-reinforced plastic depends on the mechanical properties of both the fibre and matrix, their volume relative to one another, and the fibre length and orientation within the matrix. Reinforcement of the matrix occurs by definition when the FRP material exhibits increased strength or elasticity relative to the strength and elasticity of the matrix alone.

==Process description==
FRP involves two distinct processes, the first is the process whereby the fibrous material is manufactured and formed, the second is the process whereby fibrous materials are bonded with the matrix during moulding.

===Fibre===

====Manufacture of fibre fabric====
Reinforcing Fibre is manufactured in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional orientations:
#Two-dimensional fibre glass-reinforced polymer is characterized by a laminated structure in which the fibres are only aligned along the plane in x-direction, and y-direction of the material. This means that no fibres are aligned in the through-thickness or the z-direction, this lack of alignment in the through thickness can create a disadvantage in cost and processing. Costs and labour increase because conventional processing techniques used to fabricate composites, such as wet hand lay-up, autoclave and resin transfer moulding, require a high amount of skilled labour to cut, stack and consolidate into a preformed component.
#Three-dimensional fibreglass-reinforced polymer composites are materials with three-dimensional fibre structures that incorporate fibres in the x-direction, y-direction and z-direction. The development of three-dimensional orientations arose from industry&#x27;s need to reduce fabrication costs, to increase through-thickness mechanical properties, and to improve impact damage tolerance; all were problems associated with two-dimensional fibre-reinforced polymers.

==== Manufacture of fibre preforms ====
Fibre preforms are how the fibres are manufactured before being bonded to the matrix. Fibre preforms are often manufactured in sheets, continuous mats, or as continuous filaments for spray applications. The four major ways to manufacture the fibre preform is through the textile processing techniques of weaving, knitting, braiding and stitching.

#Weaving can be done in a conventional manner to produce two-dimensional fibres as well as in a multilayer weaving that can create three-dimensional fibres. However, multilayer weaving requires multiple layers of warp yarns to create fibres in the z-direction, creating a few disadvantages in manufacturing, namely the time to set up all the warp yarns on the loom. Therefore, most multilayer weaving is currently used to produce relatively narrow width products, or high value products where the cost of the preform production is acceptable. Another one of the main problems facing the use of multilayer woven fabrics is the difficulty in producing a fabric that contains fibres oriented at other than right angles to each other.
#The second major way of manufacturing fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is suited to the manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving in the production of large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four-step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding. Four-step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure, as a reed is used in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step process includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a lesser number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction: the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four-step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two-step and four-step machines.
#Knitting fibre preforms can be done with the traditional methods of Warp and [Weft] Knitting, and the fabric produced is often regarded by many as two-dimensional fabric, but machines with two or more needle beds are capable of producing multilayer fabrics with yarns that traverse between the layers. Developments in electronic controls for needle selection and knit loop transfer, and in the sophisticated mechanisms that allow specific areas of the fabric to be held and their movement controlled, have allowed the fabric to be formed into the required three-dimensional preform shape with a minimum of material wastage.
#Stitching is arguably the simplest of the four main textile manufacturing techniques and one that can be performed with the smallest investment in specialized machinery. Basically stitching consists of inserting a needle, carrying the stitch thread, through a stack of fabric layers to form a 3D structure. The advantages of stitching are that it is possible to stitch both dry and prepreg fabric, although the tackiness of the prepreg makes the process difficult and generally creates more damage within the prepreg material than in the dry fabric. Stitching also utilizes the standard two-dimensional fabrics that are commonly in use within the composite industry, so there is a sense of familiarity with the material systems. The use of standard fabric also allows a greater degree of flexibility in the fabric lay-up of the component than is possible with the other textile processes, which have restrictions on the fibre orientations that can be produced.

===Forming processes===
A rigid structure is usually used to establish the shape of FRP components. Parts can be laid up on a flat surface referred to as a &quot;caul plate&quot; or on a cylindrical structure referred to as a &quot;mandrel&quot;. However, most fibre-reinforced plastic parts are created with a mould or &quot;tool&quot;. Moulds can be concave female moulds, male moulds, or the mould can completely enclose the part with a top and bottom mould.

The moulding processes of FRP plastics begins by placing the fibre preform on or in the mould. The fibre preform can be dry fibre, or fibre that already contains a measured amount of resin called &quot;prepreg&quot;. Dry fibres are &quot;wetted&quot; with resin either by hand or the resin is injected into a closed mould. The part is then cured, leaving the matrix and fibres in the shape created by the mould. Heat and/or pressure are sometimes used to cure the resin and improve the quality of the final part.
The different methods of forming are listed below.

====Bladder moulding====
Individual sheets of prepreg material are laid up and placed in a female-style mould along with a balloon-like bladder. The mould is closed and placed in a heated press. Finally, the bladder is pressurized forcing the layers of material against the mould walls.

====Compression moulding====
When the raw material (plastic block, rubber block, plastic sheet, or granules) contains reinforcing fibres, a compression moulded part qualifies as a fibre-reinforced plastic. More typically the plastic preform used in compression moulding does not contain reinforcing fibres. In compression moulding, a &quot;preform&quot; or &quot;charge&quot;, of SMC, BMC is placed into mould cavity. The mould is closed and the material is formed &amp; cured inside by pressure and heat. Compression moulding offers excellent detailing for geometric shapes ranging from pattern and relief detailing to complex curves and creative forms, to precision engineering all within a maximum curing time of 20 minutes.

====Autoclave and vacuum bag====
Individual sheets of prepreg material are laid-up and placed in an open mould. The material is covered with release film, bleeder/breather material and a vacuum bag. A vacuum is pulled on part and the entire mould is placed into an autoclave (heated pressure vessel). The part is cured with a continuous vacuum to extract entrapped gasses from laminate. This is a very common process in the aerospace industry because it affords precise control over moulding due to a long, slow cure cycle that is anywhere from one to several hours. This precise control creates the exact laminate geometric forms needed to ensure strength and safety in the aerospace industry, but it is also slow and labour-intensive, meaning costs often confine it to the aerospace industry.

====Mandrel wrapping====
Sheets of prepreg material are wrapped around a steel or aluminium mandrel. The prepreg material is compacted by nylon or polypropylene cello tape. Parts are typically batch cured by vacuum bagging and hanging in an oven. After cure, the cello and mandrel are removed leaving a hollow carbon tube. This process creates strong and robust hollow carbon tubes.

====Wet layup====
Wet layup forming combines fibre reinforcement and the matrix as they are placed on the forming tool. Reinforcing fibre layers are placed in an open mould and then saturated with a wet resin by pouring it over the fabric and working it into the fabric. The mould is then left so that the resin will cure, usually at room temperature, though heat is sometimes used to ensure a proper cure. Sometimes a vacuum bag is used to compress a wet layup. Glass fibres are most commonly used for this process, the results are widely known as fibreglass, and is used to make common products like skis, canoes, kayaks and surf boards.

====Chopper gun====
Continuous strands of fibreglass are pushed through a hand-held gun that both chops the strands and combines them with a catalysed resin such as polyester. The impregnated chopped glass is shot onto the mould surface in whatever thickness and design the human operator thinks is appropriate. This process is good for large production runs at economical cost, but produces geometric shapes with less strength than other moulding processes and has poor dimensional tolerance.

====Filament winding====
Machines pull fibre bundles through a wet bath of resin and wound over a rotating steel mandrel in specific orientations. Parts are cured either room temperature or elevated temperatures. Mandrel is extracted, leaving a final geometric shape but can be left in some cases.

====Pultrusion====
Fibre bundles and slit fabrics are pulled through a wet bath of resin and formed into the rough part shape. Saturated material is extruded from a heated closed die curing while being continuously pulled through die. Some of the end products of pultrusion are structural shapes, i.e. I beam, angle, channel and flat sheet. These materials can be used to create all sorts of fibreglass structures such as ladders, platforms, handrail systems tank, pipe and pump supports.

====Resin transfer moulding====
Also called resin infusion. Fabrics are placed into a mould into which wet resin is then injected. Resin is typically pressurized and forced into a cavity which is under vacuum in resin transfer moulding. Resin is entirely pulled into cavity under vacuum in vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding. This moulding process allows precise tolerances and detailed shaping, but can sometimes fail to fully saturate the fabric leading to weak spots in the final shape.

==Advantages and limitations==
FRP allows the alignment of the glass fibres of thermoplastics to suit specific design programs. Specifying the orientation of reinforcing fibres can increase the strength and resistance to deformation of the polymer. Glass reinforced polymers are strongest and most resistive to deforming forces when the polymers fibres are parallel to the force being exerted, and are weakest when the fibres are perpendicular. Thus, this ability is at once both an advantage or a limitation depending on the context of use. Weak spots of perpendicular fibres can be used for natural hinges and connections, but can also lead to material failure when production processes fail to properly orient the fibres parallel to expected forces. When forces are exerted perpendicular to the orientation of fibres, the strength and elasticity of the polymer is less than the matrix alone. In cast resin components made of glass reinforced polymers such as UP and EP, the orientation of fibres can be oriented in two-dimensional and three-dimensional weaves. This means that when forces are possibly perpendicular to one orientation, they are parallel to another orientation; this eliminates the potential for weak spots in the polymer.

===Failure modes===
Structural failure can occur in FRP materials when:
*Tensile forces stretch the matrix more than the fibres, causing the material to shear at the interface between matrix and fibres.
*Tensile forces near the end of the fibres exceed the tolerances of the matrix, separating the fibres from the matrix.
*Tensile forces can also exceed the tolerances of the fibres causing the fibres themselves to fracture leading to material failure.

==Material requirements==

A thermoset polymer matrix material, or engineering grade thermoplastic polymer matrix material, must meet certain requirements in order to first be suitable for FRPs and ensure a successful reinforcement of itself. The matrix must be able to properly saturate, and preferably bond chemically with the fibre reinforcement for maximum adhesion within a suitable curing period. The matrix must also completely envelop the fibres to protect them from cuts and notches that would reduce their strength, and to transfer forces to the fibres. The fibres must also be kept separate from each other so that if failure occurs it is localized as much as possible, and if failure occurs the matrix must also debond from the fibre for similar reasons. Finally, the matrix should be of a plastic that remains chemically and physically stable during and after the reinforcement and moulding processes. To be suitable as reinforcement material, fibre additives must increase the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the matrix and meet the following conditions; fibres must exceed critical fibre content; the strength and rigidity of fibres itself must exceed the strength and rigidity of the matrix alone; and there must be optimum bonding between fibres and matrix

===Glass fibre===

&quot;Fibreglass reinforced plastics&quot; or FRPs (commonly referred to simply as fibreglass) use textile grade glass fibres. These textile fibres are different from other forms of glass fibres used to deliberately trap air, for insulating applications (see glass wool). Textile glass fibres begin as varying combinations of SiO2, Al2O3, B2O3, CaO, or MgO in powder form. These mixtures are then heated through direct melting to temperatures around 1300 degrees Celsius, after which dies are used to extrude filaments of glass fibre in diameter ranging from 9 to 17 μm. These filaments are then wound into larger threads and spun onto bobbins for transportation and further processing. Glass fibre is by far the most popular means to reinforce plastic and thus enjoys a wealth of production processes, some of which are applicable to aramid and carbon fibres as well owing to their shared fibrous qualities.

Roving is a process where filaments are spun into larger diameter threads. These threads are then commonly used for woven reinforcing glass fabrics and mats, and in spray applications.

Fibre fabrics (glass cloth, etc.) are web-form fabric reinforcing material that has both warp and weft directions. Fibre mats are web-form non-woven mats of glass fibres. Mats are manufactured in cut dimensions with chopped fibres, or in continuous mats using continuous fibres. Chopped fibre glass is used in processes where lengths of glass threads are cut between 3 and 26 mm, threads are then used in plastics most commonly intended for moulding processes. Glass fibre short strands are short 0.2–0.3 mm strands of glass fibres that are used to reinforce thermoplastics most commonly for injection moulding.

===Carbon fibre===
Carbon fibres are created when polyacrylonitrile fibres (PAN), Pitch resins, or Rayon are carbonized (through oxidation and thermal pyrolysis) at high temperatures. Through further processes of graphitizing or stretching, the fibres strength or elasticity can be enhanced respectively. Carbon fibres are manufactured in diameters analogous to glass fibres with diameters ranging from 4 to 17 μm. These fibres wound into larger threads for transportation and further production processes. Further production processes include weaving or braiding into carbon fabrics, cloths and mats analogous to those described for glass that can then be used in actual reinforcements.

===Aramid fibre===

Aramid fibres are most commonly known as Kevlar, Nomex and Technora. Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an amine group and a carboxylic acid halide group (aramid);. Commonly, this occurs when an aromatic polyamide is spun from a liquid concentration of sulphuric acid into a crystallized fibre. Fibres are then spun into larger threads in order to weave into large ropes or woven fabrics (aramid). Aramid fibres are manufactured with varying grades based on strength and rigidity, so that the material can be adapted to meet specific design requirements, such as cutting the tough material during manufacture.

==Example polymer and reinforcement combinations==
==Applications==

Fibre-reinforced plastics are best suited for any design program that demands weight savings, precision engineering, definite tolerances, and the simplification of parts in both production and operation.The fibres provide strength and stiffness to the material, while the polymer matrix holds the fibres together and transfers loads between them. FRP composites have a wide range of applications across various industries due to their unique combination of properties, including high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and design flexibility. A moulded polymer product is cheaper, faster, and easier to manufacture than a cast aluminium or steel product, and maintains similar and sometimes better tolerances and material strengths.

=== Structural applications ===
FRP can be applied to strengthen the beams, columns, and slabs of buildings and bridges. It is possible to increase the strength of structural members even after they have been severely damaged due to loading conditions. In the case of damaged reinforced concrete members, this would first require the repair of the member by removing loose debris and filling in cavities and cracks with mortar or epoxy resin. Once the member is repaired, strengthening can be achieved through wet, hand lay-up of fibre sheets impregnated with epoxy resin, applied to the cleaned and prepared surfaces of the member.

Two techniques are typically adopted for the strengthening of beams, depending on the strength enhancement desired: flexural strengthening or shear strengthening. In many cases it may be necessary to provide both strength enhancements. For the flexural strengthening of a beam, FRP sheets or plates are applied to the tension face of the member (the bottom face for a simply supported member with applied top loading or gravity loading). Principal tensile fibres are oriented parallel to the beam&#x27;s longitudinal axis, similar to its internal flexural steel reinforcement. This increases the beam strength and its stiffness (load required to cause unit deflection), but decreases the deflection capacity and ductility.

For the shear strengthening of a beam, the FRP is applied on the web (sides) of a member with fibres oriented transverse to the beam&#x27;s longitudinal axis. Resisting of shear forces is achieved in a similar manner as internal steel stirrups, by bridging shear cracks that form under applied loading. FRP can be applied in several configurations, depending on the exposed faces of the member and the degree of strengthening desired, this includes: side bonding, U-wraps (U-jackets), and closed wraps (complete wraps). Side bonding involves applying FRP to the sides of the beam only. It provides the least amount of shear strengthening due to failures caused by de-bonding from the concrete surface at the FRP free edges. For U-wraps, the FRP is applied continuously in a &#x27;U&#x27; shape around the sides and bottom (tension) face of the beam. If all faces of a beam are accessible, the use of closed wraps is desirable as they provide the most strength enhancement. Closed wrapping involves applying FRP around the entire perimeter of the member, such that there are no free ends and the typical failure mode is rupture of the fibres. For all wrap configurations, the FRP can be applied along the length of the member as a continuous sheet or as discrete strips, having a predefined minimum width and spacing.

Slabs may be strengthened by applying FRP strips at their bottom (tension) face. This will result in better flexural performance, since the tensile resistance of the slabs is supplemented by the tensile strength of FRP. In the case of beams and slabs, the effectiveness of FRP strengthening depends on the performance of the resin chosen for bonding. This is particularly an issue for shear strengthening using side bonding or U-wraps. Columns are typically wrapped with FRP around their perimeter, as with closed or complete wrapping. This not only results in higher shear resistance, but more crucial for column design, it results in increased compressive strength under axial loading. The FRP wrap works by restraining the lateral expansion of the column, which can enhance confinement in a similar manner as spiral reinforcement does for the column core.

=== Elevator cable ===
In June 2013, KONE elevator company announced Ultrarope for use as a replacement for steel cables in elevators. It seals the carbon fibres in high-friction polymer. Unlike steel cable, Ultrarope was designed for buildings that require up to of lift. Steel elevators top out at . The company estimated that in a high building, an elevator would use 15% less electrical power than a steel-cabled version. As of June 2013, the product had passed all European Union and United States certification tests.

==Design considerations==
FRP is used in designs that require a measure of strength or modulus of elasticity for which non-reinforced plastics and other material choices are ill-suited, either mechanically or economically. The primary design consideration for using FRP is to ensure that the material is used economically and in a manner that takes advantage of its specific structural characteristics, but this is not always the case. The orientation of fibres creates a material weakness perpendicular to the fibres. Thus the use of fibre reinforcement and their orientation affects the strength, rigidity, elasticity and hence the functionality of the final product itself. Orienting the fibres either unidirectionally, 2-dimensionally, or 3-dimensionally during production affects the strength, flexibility, and elasticity of the final product. Fibres oriented in the direction of applied forces display greater resistance to distortion from these forces, thus areas of a product that must withstand forces will be reinforced with fibres oriented parallel to the forces, and areas that require flexibility, such as natural hinges, will have fibres oriented perpendicular to the forces.

Orienting the fibres in more dimensions avoids this either-or scenario and creates objects that seek to avoid any specific weakness due to the unidirectional orientation of fibres. The properties of strength, flexibility and elasticity can also be magnified or diminished through the geometric shape and design of the final product. For example, ensuring proper wall thickness and creating multifunctional geometric shapes that can be moulded as a single piece enhances the material and structural integrity of the product by reducing the requirements for joints, connections, and hardware.

===Disposal and recycling concerns===
As a subset of plastic, FR plastics are liable to a number of the issues and concerns in plastic waste disposal and recycling. Plastics pose a particular challenge in recycling because they are derived from polymers and monomers that often cannot be separated and returned to their virgin states. For this reason not all plastics can be recycled for re-use, in fact some estimates claim only 20% to 30% of plastics can be recycled at all. Fibre-reinforced plastics and their matrices share these disposal and environmental concerns. Investigation of safe disposal methods has led to two main variations involving the application of intense heat: in one binding agents are burned off - in the process recapturing some of the sunk material cost in the form of heat - and incombustible elements captured by filtration; in the other the incombustible material is burned in a cement kiln, the fibres becoming an integral part of the resulting cast material. In addition to concerns regarding safe disposal, the fact that the fibres themselves are difficult to remove from the matrix and preserve for re-use means FRP&#x27;s amplify these challenges. FRP&#x27;s are inherently difficult to separate into base materials, that is into fibre and matrix, and the matrix is difficult to separate into usable plastics, polymers, and monomers. These are all concerns for environmentally-informed design today. Plastics do often offer savings in energy and economic savings in comparison to other materials. In addition, with the advent of new more environmentally friendly matrices such as bioplastics and UV-degradable plastics, FRP will gain environmental sensitivity.

<text>Meng Keo Pichenda is a Cambodian singer and has been contracted to many companies for her services. She is the youngest of three sisters, two of them are vocal musicians.

She is well known for her unique and balanced sound-pitched voice and was particularly successful in the late 1990s, credited for a change in direction in Cambodian music. However, she prefers writing traditional Khmer songs rather than dance music.

She began traditional Khmer dancing when she was just a young girl, and when she turned 17 her music career began. Her style of music attracts the youth of Cambodia as well as adults. She is considered one of the most popular artists in Cambodia today. Some of the more recent tracks released are composed by Meng Keo Pichenda herself.

==Note==
In the year 2000 to recent, she is credited as Meng Keo Picheta in DVDs and Albums. She sometimes appears in various Live Shows companies.

<doc id="944350" wikidata="Q4386797" url="?curid=944350" title="Buried treasure">
<text>Buried treasure is a literary trope commonly associated with depictions of pirates, alongside Vikings, criminals, and outlaws in the Old West. According to popular conception, these people often buried their stolen fortunes in remote places, intending to return to them later (often with the use of a pirate&#x27;s treasure map).

Pirates burying treasure was a rare occurrence, with the only known instance being William Kidd, who buried some of his wealth on Gardiners Island. The myth of buried pirate treasure was popularized by such 19th-century fiction as &quot;Wolfert Webber&quot; by Washington Irving, &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe, and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson. The idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure is considered a fictional device.

There are cases of buried treasure from different historical periods, such as the Dacian king Decebalus and Visigoth king Alaric I, who both changed the course of rivers to hide their treasures. Legends of buried pirate treasure have existed for centuries, but authenticated discoveries are rare. For example, extensive excavations on Oak Island, Nova Scotia have not yielded any treasure. The only authenticated treasure chest in the United States is kept at the Pirate Soul Museum in St. Augustine, Florida.

Buried treasure is a cultural concept and not the same as a hoard, which is typically found by archaeologists and metal detectors. The Fenn treasure, reportedly buried by millionaire Forrest Fenn in 2010, was found in 2020 in Wyoming.

==Pirates==
Pirates burying treasure was rare. The only pirate known to have actually buried treasure was William Kidd, who is believed to have buried at least some of his wealth on Gardiners Island near Long Island before sailing into New York City. Kidd had originally been commissioned as a privateer for England, but his behavior had strayed into outright piracy, and he hoped that his treasure could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations to avoid punishment. His bid was unsuccessful, however, and Kidd was hanged as a pirate.

In English fiction, there are three well-known stories that helped to popularize the myth of buried pirate treasure: &quot;Wolfert Webber&quot; (1824) by Washington Irving, &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; (1843) by Edgar Allan Poe and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883) by Robert Louis Stevenson. These stories differ widely in plot and literary treatment but are all based on the William Kidd legend. David Cordingly states that &quot;The effect of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; on our perception of pirates cannot be overestimated&quot; and that the idea of treasure maps leading to buried treasure &quot;is an entirely fictional device&quot;. Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; was directly influenced by Irving&#x27;s &quot;Wolfert Webber,&quot; Stevenson saying in his preface, &quot;It is my debt to Washington Irving that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther... the whole inner spirit and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters... were the property of Washington Irving.&quot;

In 1911, American author Ralph D. Paine conducted a survey of all known or purported stories of buried treasure and published them in &quot;The Book of Buried Treasure&quot;. He found a common trait in all the stories: there was always a lone survivor of a piratical crew who somehow preserved a chart showing where the treasure was buried, but unable to return himself, he transfers the map or information to a friend or shipmate, usually on his deathbed. This person would then go search in vain for the treasure, but not before transferring the legend down to another hapless seeker.

==Cases==

The Roman historian Dio Cassius says that, in the early 2nd century, the Dacian king Decebalus had changed the course of the river Sargetia and buried tons of gold and silver in the riverbed. Later, he ordered the river to be restored, and the slaves involved in the works to be executed. However, one of his nobles revealed the treasure&#x27;s location to the Romans. The Byzantine historian Jordanes tells a similar story of the burial of the Visigoth king Alaric I and his treasure under the river Busento in 410. The burial places of the Khazar kings (&quot;qoruq&quot;) and other inner Asian people were also under a rerouted river.

There are a number of reports of supposed buried pirate treasure that surfaced much earlier than these works, indicating that the idea was around for more than a century before those stories were published. For example, extensive excavation has taken place on Oak Island (in Nova Scotia) since 1795 in the belief that one or more pirate captains had hidden large amounts of valuables there. These excavations were said to have been prompted by still older legends of buried pirate treasure in the area. No treasure has yet been reported found.

The Treasure of Lima is a supposed buried treasure on Cocos Island in the Pacific abandoned by pirates. The treasure, estimated to be worth £160 million, was stolen by British Captain William Thompson in 1820 after he was entrusted to transport it from Peru to Mexico.

The only authenticated treasure chest in the United States, once owned by Thomas Tew, is kept at the Pirate Soul Museum in St. Augustine, Florida.

Pirate Olivier Levasseur, also known as &quot;The Buzzard&quot; (La Buse), was rumored to have hidden treasure before his death in 1730. No such treasure has been found.

During the 1666 Great Fire of London, wealthy residents of the city buried luxury goods such as gold and wine in the ground to protect them from the raging flames above. Samuel Pepys, the noted diarist, buried a wheel of cheese in his garden to protect it from the fire.

Buried treasure is not the same as a hoard, of which there have been thousands of examples found by archaeologists and metal detectors. Buried treasure is as much a cultural concept as an objective thing. It is related to pirates and other criminals who leave stolen artifacts behind for later retrieval, typically in remote places like islands, sometimes with maps leading back to the treasure.

The Fenn treasure was reportedly buried by millionaire Forrest Fenn around 2010 and found in 2020, somewhere in Wyoming.

<text>Andreea Mădălina Răducan (; born 30 September 1983) is a retired gymnast from Bârlad, Romania. She currently works as a sports announcer and journalist.

Răducan began competing in gymnastics at a young age and was training at the Romanian junior national facility by the age of 12. As one of the outstanding gymnasts of the Romanian team in the late 1990s, Răducan was known both for her difficult repertoire of skills and her dance and presentation. Over her four-year senior career, she won Olympic or World Championships medals on every event except the uneven bars and earned three individual World Championships titles, on the floor exercise in 1999 and 2001 and the balance beam in 2001.

Răducan competed at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where she contributed strongly to the Romanian team&#x27;s gold medal and won an individual silver medal on the vault. She was also the original winner of the all-around title, but was disqualified and stripped of her gold medal shortly after the competition concluded, when it was revealed that she had failed doping controls, testing positive for pseudoephedrine, a banned substance. She and her coaches maintained that she had been given the substance in two cold medicine pills by a Romanian team physician, and that they had not affected her performance in any way.

The case generated a significant amount of media attention, and Răducan was supported by members of the gymnastics community and the Romanian public. Her case was brought to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in autumn 2000. Răducan herself was exonerated of any personal wrongdoing by the CAS, the Romanian Olympic Committee and the International Gymnastics Federation, and was not subject to any disciplinary measures. However, her medal was not reinstated, and the team doctor who administered the medicine was banned for two Olympic cycles.

Răducan returned the year after the Olympics to win five additional World Championships medals, but retired from gymnastics in 2002. As an adult, she has worked as a sports announcer and media personality, and has pursued university level studies in journalism.

==Early career==
Răducan was one of the &quot;new-generation gymnasts&quot; groomed to take over the torch of Romanian gymnastics excellence after the retirements of the Olympic medalists Lavinia Miloșovici and Gina Gogean. She began gymnastics at the age of four and a half in her hometown of Bârlad. In 1996, after winning over twenty medals in local and regional competitions, she was invited to train at the Romanian junior team facility in Onești. Two years later, she was promoted to the national training center in Deva.

Răducan&#x27;s first major international event was the 1998 Junior European Championships, where she won a silver medal on the balance beam, tied for bronze on the floor exercise and took fourth place in the all-around. The next year, she rose to the senior ranks and made an impact at the World Championships in Tianjin, China, winning the floor exercise final and placing fifth in the all-around.

While Răducan&#x27;s work on the uneven bars was considered weak, her skills on beam, vault and floor exercise were applauded. She was also admired because, unlike other members of the Romanian team, she showed a great deal of expression in her choreography and a wide variety of complex skills in her routines.

==Sydney Olympics==
Răducan competed well at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, helping the Romanian women to win their first Olympic team gold medal since 1984. She qualified for the floor and vault event finals, and, along with her teammates Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru, the all-around final. In the preliminary round of competition she had the second highest all-around score of all competitors in the competition, trailing Russia&#x27;s Svetlana Khorkina by 0.288.

The all-around final was mired in controversy. The vault was set 5 centimeters too low, creating a dangerous situation that completely altered the gymnasts&#x27; pre- and post-flights. As a result of the incorrectly set vault, many gymnasts suffered serious crashes and injuries during both the warm-ups and the competition, including Svetlana Khorkina. Even those who escaped injury found themselves shaken by their experiences on the vault. When the error was discovered in the third rotation, International Federation of Gymnastics officials reset the vault height and allowed the competition to continue. They did permit the gymnasts who had vaulted in the first two rotations to take another turn on vault and to be rescored; not every athlete accepted this offer.

Răducan was one of the gymnasts who had vaulted on the incorrectly set apparatus but did not suffer a fall on the event and performed without serious error. She continued through the competition, turning in strong performances on balance beam and floor exercise, and ended up winning the all-around gold medal. On the podium with her were her Romanian teammates: Amânar with silver and Olaru with bronze. Răducan was the first Romanian gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title since Nadia Comăneci in 1976; it was also the first time since 1960 that gymnasts from a single country swept the women&#x27;s all-around podium at the Olympics. It was also the last time it was possible for three gymnasts from the same country to sweep the all-around, as the &quot;two per country rule&quot; was introduced in the next Olympic cycle. Răducan went on to win the silver medal in the vault final, behind Elena Zamolodchikova of Russia and ahead of Ekaterina Lobazniouk of Russia. Speculations around the all around gold arose and Răducan was informed that there was a possibility that she could be stripped of her gold medal. This affected her mentally and she went to the floor final fazed by the situation. She fell on her third tumbling pass, and received a score of 9.275. Without that error, she would have scored a 9.775, which would have been enough for the bronze medal.

===Doping charge===
Several days after the competition concluded, the International Olympic Committee announced that Răducan had tested positive for pseudoephedrine, a banned substance.

Răducan and her coaches maintained that she was innocent. As a minor, they argued that she had only followed the treatment plan recommended by Ioachim Oană, the team physician. In the book she published in 2010, Răducan states that a few hours before the competition she had been given Nurofen Cold &amp; Flu, a common over-the-counter medication containing pseudoephedrine, to help treat a fever and cough. She also said that the pills had made her feel dizzy instead of helping her in any way.

Despite strenuous appeals from Răducan, her coaches, the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, and certain members of the gymnastics community, she was stripped of the gold medal. The gold was re-awarded to Amânar, Olaru was promoted to silver, and former fourth-place finisher Liu Xuan from China was given the bronze medal. Răducan&#x27;s test samples from the team and vault event finals were clean; she was therefore allowed to keep the medals she won in these competitions. The Romanian team doctor who gave Răducan the drug in two cold medicine pills was expelled from the Games and suspended through the 2002 Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Both Amânar and Olaru expressed their belief that Răducan was the deserving all-around gold medalist, as did Liu Xuan, who noted,
&quot;I think the all-around champ (Răducan) is very good. I feel very sad and sorry for her that this problem occurred. I can&#x27;t make sense of it. ...In gymnastics, we rely on technique to complete our moves. It&#x27;s not possible to rely on drugs or strength, you have to rely on skill.&quot; All three declined a formal ceremony when the medals were re-awarded. Following the announcement that Răducan would be stripped of her medal, Olaru and Amânar initially decided to refuse their new medals. However, they changed their minds in order to bring the medals back to Romania. Amânar said of the gold medal, &quot;I didn&#x27;t win it. It was won by Andreea and belongs to Andreea.&quot; It was thought that Amânar had given Răducan the gold medal back once the team returned to Romania, but Răducan herself is quoted as saying, in an interview with gymnastics podcast &quot;Gymcastic&quot;:

===Aftermath===
Răducan&#x27;s case was brought before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in late September 2000. While the arbitration panel did concede that Răducan had not gained any advantage by taking the pseudoephedrine, and that she was an underage athlete who had followed her team physician&#x27;s instructions, they also upheld the IOC&#x27;s decision. The basis for their decision was the belief that the Anti-Doping Code of the Olympics had to be enforced &quot;without compromise&quot;, regardless of the intentions or age of the athlete.

Răducan was exonerated of any personal wrongdoing by the Romanian Olympic Committee, and therefore was not subjected to the sporting ban usually imposed on athletes involved in doping cases. However, Ion Țiriac, the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee (ROC), resigned over the scandal. The executive committee of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) also unanimously decided not to impose any suspension or punishment on Răducan, taking the stance that losing her medal &quot;was punishment enough for an athlete who was innocent in this situation&quot;. The FIG, IOC and ROC all agreed with the punishment and suspension of Dr. Oană, viewing him as the guilty party for administering the banned substance to Răducan and her teammate. Oană was permitted to keep his medical license and cleared of malpractice by the Deva Physicians&#x27; Association, who stated that he had not committed any offense &quot;from a medical perspective&quot;.

Despite the controversy, Răducan was still seen as a positive and even sympathetic figure. She received a significant amount of support in Romania, and members of the gymnastics community, including Nadia Comăneci, publicly expressed their support. On returning to Romania with her teammates, she was personally greeted and presented with flowers by Romanian President Emil Constantinescu.
Răducan was given a replacement medal in pure gold by a Romanian jeweler; she also received several endorsements and sponsorships. At one point, a Răducan doll was even rumored to be in the works. In addition, the prize money she would have been awarded from the Romanian Olympic Committee for her all-around gold was replaced, and doubled, by a group of Romanian businessmen. She, along with Amanar, was awarded a diplomatic passport by the Romanian government for being a &quot;good ambassador for Romania&quot;.

==After Sydney==
Răducan continued to train in Deva after the Olympics. With the retirement of her Sydney teammates Amânar, Olaru, and Presăcan, she found herself one of the senior gymnasts at Deva. At the 2001 World Championships in Ghent, Belgium, she was part of the gold medal-winning Romanian team and picked up four individual medals: gold on floor exercise and balance beam and bronze in the all-around and vault. Injuries and other concerns marred her training in 2002, and after a poor showing at the Worlds in Hungary, she quietly retired.

After retiring, Răducan became a sports announcer in Romania. Her assignments for EuroSport have included the 2004 Olympics in Athens. She also has her own television show and does modelling and promotional work. Răducan also has a master&#x27;s degree in journalism from the University of Bucharest.

In 2010, Răducan released her autobiography, &quot;The Other Side of the Medal&quot;, which provides further insight into the disqualification of her all-around result at the 2000 Olympic Games. The 2020 &quot;Golden Girl&quot; film, directed by Adrian Robe and Denisa Morariu-Tamas, covers her attempt to reclaim her title.

==President of Romanian Federation==
On August 4, 2017, Andreea Răducan was elected president of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation (RGF). She took over from Adrian Stoica, who was the President of the Federation for 12 years. It was expected to be a huge challenge for Răducan to improve the performances of the Romanian team, who did not qualify a full team to compete at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The failure to qualify marked the first time Romania did not field a gymnastics team at the Games since 1968.

Drawing on the success of Romania successfully hosting the European Gymnastics Championships April 18–23, 2017, Romania was expected to contend for the all-around and individual titles at the 2017 World Gymnastics Championships in Montreal, Canada. Unfortunately, their arguably best all-around gymnast Larisa Iordache suffered a torn Achilles tendon during warm-up for qualifying. Romania&#x27;s other hope for a medal, Cătălina Ponor, multiple medal winner in her gymnastics career, failed to qualify in either of the events she competed – beam or floor.

She stepped down from her position upon the failure of either the women&#x27;s or men&#x27;s teams qualifying for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

<text>Olympic Highway is a rural road in the central western and south-eastern Riverina regions of New South Wales, Australia. It services rural communities, links Hume Highway with Mid-Western Highway, and provides part of an alternate road link between Sydney and via and as well as servicing Wagga Wagga, linking with Sturt Highway.

==Route==
Olympic Highway runs generally north–south, roughly aligned to sections of the Sydney–Melbourne and the Blayney–Demondrille railway lines. A section through Wagga Wagga is a four-lane divided urban road where it is concurrent with Sturt Highway. Olympic Highway approximately parallels Hume Highway to the east and Newell Highway to the west, sharing a short concurrency with Sturt Highway in Wagga Wagga. It is mostly single carriageway and also includes wider sections within urban areas and some passing lanes. Where the road passes through suburban areas it accommodates both parking and pedestrian needs of the town shopping centre and highway through traffic.

At its northern terminus in Cowra, Olympic Highway meets Mid-Western Highway, along which route A41 continues east to Bathurst, and west as route B64 to ; and Lachlan Valley Way that generally runs northwest–southwest between and and beyond. Olympic Highway heads generally south by west through Koorawatha, , , , Wagga Wagga, and towards its southern terminus via a trumpet interchange with Hume Highway located north of Albury at .

The only major river crossing is the Murrumbidgee River, crossed between and Wagga via the Gobbagombalin Bridge, at long believed to be the longest continuous-span viaduct in New South Wales, situated about northwest of the Wagga CBD and opened on 26 July 1997. Prior to the completion of the &quot;Gobba&quot; Bridge, the Olympic Highway followed a route that took it through the Wagga central business district via the Hampden Bridge, a wooden Allan Truss bridge that was opened in 1895 and eventually demolished in 2014.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later the Department of Main Roads, and eventually Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 57 was declared from the intersection with Monaro Highway (today Sturt Highway) at Wagga Wagga to Old Junee and continuing north via Temora, Wyalong, Condobolin and Tullamore to the intersection with North-Western Highway (today Mitchell Highway) at Trangie, Main Road No. 210 was declared from the intersection with Hume Highway near Ettamogah, via Culcairn, Henty to the intersection with Wagga-Narrandera Road (today Sturt Highway) at Wagga Wagga, Main Road No. 239 was declared from Young to Wombat (and continuing southwards to Murrumburrah, and northwards to Grenfell), and Main Road No. 243 was declared from Junee to Wallendbeen (and continuing westwards via Coolamon and Grong Grong to Narrandera, and continuing eastwards via Harden to Bowning), on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Trunk Road 57 and Main Roads 210 and 239 and 243 on 8 April 1929.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, truncated the eastern end of Main Road 243 to Junee on 16 March 1938 (with its western end terminating at the newly declared State Highway 17, later Newell Highway, at Narrandera). Trunk Road 57 was extended south, from Wagga Wagga via Henty and Culcairn to the intersection with Hume Highway near Ettamogah (subsuming Main Road 210), and declared Trunk Road 78 from the intersection with Mid-Western Highway in Cowra via Young, Wombat, Wallandbeen and Cootamundra to Junee (the southern end of Main Road 239 was truncated to meet Trunk Road 78 at Young), on the same day, 29 June 1938; Trunk Road 78 was later extended a short distance west past Junee to the intersection with Trunk Road 57 south of Old Junee on 17 May 1939.

Trunk Road 78 was extended further south via Wagga Wagga, Henty and Culcairn to the intersection with Hume Highway near Ettamogah (subsuming the former alignment of Trunk Road 57, which was truncated just south of Old Junee) and was officially named Olympic Way on 19 June 1963, in honour of part of the path that the Olympic Torch took on its journey from Cowra to Albury for the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. The southern end of Olympic Way was re-aligned on 1 July 1988, to run from Gerogery directly south to terminate at the current-day intersection with Hume Highway roughly 10 km north of its previous terminus at Ettamogah (the former alignment is now known as Gerogery Road).

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Olympic Way was renamed Olympic Highway in 1996, and the route between Wagga Wagga and Cowra was used again for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games torch relay. Olympic Highway today retains its declaration as Main Road 78, but despite its name, the road is not an official highway as classified by Transport for NSW, and is considered a rural road.

Olympic Highway was signed National Route 41 across its entire length in 1974. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in both states in 2013, this was replaced with route A41.

<text>Finsch is a relatively small lunar impact crater in the mid-part of Mare Serenitatis that has been almost completely (other than the crest of the rim) covered by the mare, forming a ghost crater in the lava plain. It was named after German zoologist Otto Finsch. It is located to the south-southeast of the crater Sarabhai and northeast of Bessel.

<doc id="944363" wikidata="Q1169456" url="?curid=944363" title="Fair catch">
<text>A fair catch is a feature of American football and several other codes of football, in which a player attempting to catch a ball kicked by the opposing team – either on a kickoff or punt – is entitled to catch the ball without interference from any member of the kicking team. A player, usually a return specialist, wishing to make a fair catch signals his intent by extending one arm above his head and waving it while the kicked ball is in flight. A ball caught in this manner becomes dead once caught, i.e., the player catching the ball is not entitled to advance the ball, and the receiving team begins its drive at the spot where the ball was caught. 

Since 2018, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has had a touchback provision where fair catches caught anywhere inside the 25-yard line on a kickoff are placed at the 25 for the ensuing drive. In 2023, the National Football League (NFL) adopted the same rule in order to reduce the frequency of player injuries on kickoffs. Under NFL and National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rules, a team awarded a fair catch is also entitled to attempt a fair catch kick from the spot of the catch; however, this is rarely done. 

The main reason for a fair catch is to protect the receiver. Because the receiver has to direct his attention toward catching the airborne ball, he cannot focus on opponents running towards him and is usually not in a position to protect himself immediately when he catches the ball, and is therefore particularly vulnerable to injury from being hit by an opponent. He is also at risk for fumbling or muffing the kicked ball if the punter intentionally makes a high short kick to allow defenders time to hit the receiver. A second reason for a fair catch, on a punted ball, is to prevent the ball from rolling toward the receiving team&#x27;s goal and being downed deep in the team&#x27;s own territory.

== Variations ==
===NFL and NFHS rules===
The receiving team on a kickoff or punt is always entitled to an unobstructed attempt to catch the ball in its initial flight, before it is touched by a player or it hits the ground. However, unless a fair catch is called, the player catching the ball may legally be hit or tackled once he catches the ball, and is thus prone to injury and fumbling the ball, particularly if he has not had a chance to protect his body or the ball. 

A member of the team attempting to catch a punt or kickoff may signal for a fair catch. To request a fair catch, the receiver must raise one arm fully above their head and wave it from side to side while the ball is in flight. Once the signal is given, the kicking team may not interfere with the receiver&#x27;s attempt to catch the ball. A player who performs a successful fair catch cannot be tackled or hit: once caught, the ball is dead and, barring any penalties, the receiving team begins their drive from spot of the catch. They also have the option of trying a fair catch kick from that spot, though there have only been six fair catch kick attempts in the 21st century NFL and only one of those was successful. If the ball is not caught, then the fair catch is void and all other rules on kicked balls apply. 

In 2023, a new rule was adopted by the NFL that allowed kickoff returners who call for a fair catch inside the 25-yard line to be awarded a touchback and have the ball placed at the 25 for the drive, instead of at the spot of the catch. This rule, which went into effect at the start of the 2023 NFL season, applies only to kickoffs. The NFL estimated that kickoff returns would decrease by seven percent with the new fair catch rule, leading to a fifteen percent drop in concussions on those plays.

==== Penalties ====
If a member of the kicking team interferes with a fair catch attempt after the receiver gives a proper signal, the kicking team is penalized 15 yards from the spot of the foul, and a fair catch is awarded even if the ball is not caught. In the NFL, the receiving team has the option to attempt a fair catch kick from the location where the ball is spotted after the penalty is assessed.

If the receiver fails to give a proper signal (hand raised above helmet but not waved side to side), the receiving team is penalized 5 yards from the spot of the signal for an invalid fair catch signal, a fair catch is not awarded, and the receiver is not protected from being tackled.

If the receiver initiates contact with any member of the kicking team after giving a fair catch signal but before the ball is touched by another player, the receiving team is penalized 15 yards.

If the receiver signals a fair catch before the ball is caught, and runs after the ball is caught, then the run is immediately stopped, with a 5 yard penalty against the receiving team from where the ball is caught.

===NCAA rules===
NCAA rules on fair catches are similar to NFL and NFHS rules, except it does not have the fair catch kick option, and a fair catch from a kickoff that is caught between the receiving team&#x27;s goal line and its 25-yard line is a touchback. 

The NCAA abolished the fair catch in 1950 but reinstated it in 1951 without the fair catch kick option. In 2018, the additional touchback provision was added.

=== Canadian football and arena football ===
Both the 2001 and 2020 versions of the XFL removed the fair catch in an effort to attract fans who disliked the rule. Canadian football and arena football also do not have fair catch rules, with the XFL and Canadian football preferring a five-yard &quot;no-yards&quot; rule instead, where the cover team is penalized 15 yards if they invade a five-yard perimeter around the returner as they field a punt.

== Other games ==

Various forms of football descended from certain English school football games of the 19th century have had a fair catch. It was abolished early in the development of soccer, then in the middle of the 20th century by Canadian football, and slightly later by rugby league. Forms of football retaining a form of fair catch (also called &quot;mark&quot;) include American (outdoor), rugby union, and Australian rules. The American-invented intramural games speedball and speedaway have some of the flavor of the original fair catch, which was to allow handling of the ball in games where handling was otherwise forbidden. Australian rules, speedball, and speedaway do not require that the kick be from an opponent. American football requires that the catcher signal in advance, as did Canadian football before that game abolished the fair catch. Rugby union requires a player to signal a fair catch by catching the ball and shouting &quot;Mark!&quot;.

In some forms of football a player fielding an opponent&#x27;s kick must be given a certain circular unobstructed space around him in which to do so by either some or all opponents. In rugby union, rugby league, and Canadian football this applies only against members of the kicking team who are offside, and applies whether the ball is in the air, bouncing, or rolling. In Arena Football, there is no fair catch; however all members of the kicking team must refrain from penetrating the five-yard line in coverage, but only while the ball is in the air. In the Australian Football League&#x27;s variant of Australian rules football AFL 9s there is the concept of the &quot;drop-zone&quot; to protect players so that they may make a fair catch.

The various games differ as to the conditions under which a fair catch will be awarded — for example, whether the ball must be caught &quot;cleanly&quot;, i.e. without juggling. Rugby union requires a clean catch. American football allows the ball to be juggled, but not to be intentionally batted forward to improve the position of the catch (as for a free kick at goal). Australian rules is most generous, allowing unlimited hand play with the ball before it is caught, and allowing the kick to be from any other player, regardless of team (however, the ball must have travelled 15 metres) and the ball can even be dropped so long as the player is deemed to have sufficient control of its fall. In the 19th century in rugby, and into the 20th in American and Canadian football, a fair catch was allowed from certain kicks of a teammate—a punt-out or punt-on.

<text>The Bahrain International Circuit () is a motorsport venue opened in 2004 and used for drag racing, GP2 Series (now FIA Formula 2), and the annual Formula One Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle East. Beginning in 2006, Australian V8 Supercars raced at the BIC, with the event known as the Desert 400. However, the V8 Supercars did not return for the 2011 V8 Supercar season. 24 Hour endurance races are also hosted at BIC. The circuit has a FIA Grade 1 license. The circuit also has multiple layouts.

==History==

The construction of the Bahrain circuit was a national objective for Bahrain, initiated by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation. TRL was asked to build the circuit, headed by Patrick Brogan.

Race organizers were worried that the circuit would not be complete in time for the 2004 Bahrain Grand Prix and attempted to cancel the event; however, Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone refused this request. In the end, the circuit was not quite fully complete, but was good enough for the grand prix to go ahead.

After the 2004 race and ahead of the 2005 race the track was realigned at turn four, decreasing the circuit&#x27;s overall length by 5 metres in total.

In the circuit became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award, given for excellent safety, race marshal, and medical facilities, and for the high standards of technology required to maintain these.

At the 2009 Grand Prix, BIC announced a collaboration with to develop land next to the circuit. is part of the Mumtalakat group of companies. will dedicate more than 1 million square meters of business, entertainment and educational space with a value in excess of US$2bn (BHD 850million), making it one of the largest investment projects to take place in Bahrain in the past five years.

In 2011 the circuit was scheduled to be the first GP of the season. However, due to civil unrest in the country the race had to be cancelled in March 2011. On 4 June the FIA announced that the race would be scheduled for 30 October, the original slot for the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, which would be shifted to a season-closing date on 11 December. However, two days later following concerns from teams and other officials, the race organizers officially cancelled the race, choosing to focus their attention on the 2012 running. The 2012 Formula One calendar had the race scheduled for 22 April, the fourth of the season. During pre-season testing for the 2024 Formula 1 season, the second morning session was halted by a red flag and later cancelled as a drain cover in the approach to turn 10 of the circuit had been dislodged by Charles Leclerc&#x27;s SF-24.

===Construction and design===

The circuit was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, the same architect who designed the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. The main contractor for the project was Cebarco-WCT. The circuit cost approximately 56.2 million Bahraini Dinars (US$150 million) to construct. It has six separate tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip.

The circuit posed a unique problem. Positioned in the middle of a desert, there were worries that sand would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race. However, organizers were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive on the sand around the track.

The surface of the track is made of graywacke aggregate, shipped to Bahrain from Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire, England. The surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula 1 drivers for the high level of grip it offers. The same aggregate material is used at the Yas Marina Circuit, venue of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Shortly after the Formula One February 2014 testing, the first corner of the track was renamed after seven-time champion German driver Michael Schumacher in honour of his achievements and also in support after he suffered an almost fatal skiing accident late December 2013.

==Track layouts==

==Formula One Grand Prix==
The first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on 4 April 2004, making history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East. Bahrain fought off fierce competition from elsewhere in the region to stage the race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) all hoping for the prestige of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix (the UAE would host a Grand Prix from 2009).

The Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One calendar, apart from the 2006 season, when Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In , Bahrain was moved to the fourth race. For the season Bahrain was again the pre-season testing and season opener and Formula One cars drove the full &quot;Endurance Circuit&quot; to celebrate F1&#x27;s &#x27;diamond jubilee&#x27;. For 2011 however F1 was set to return to racing on the original layout used between 2004 and 2009. The race was postponed and finally cancelled due to protests in the country but F1 returned to the track for the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix. 2014 saw the track host its first ever Grand Prix under lights, as the race was scheduled as a night race to celebrate the tenth year of Formula 1 at the circuit. Subsequent editions of the race have also been held at night. In 2020 the circuit hosted two Grands Prix, the Bahrain and Sakhir Grands Prix, after the calendar was revised following the COVID-19 pandemic with the latter using the Outer Circuit layout.

==Series hosted==
The Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of high-profile series, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the FIA World Endurance Championship, the FIA Formula 2 Championship, FIA Formula 3 Championship, and Porsche Carrera Cup Middle East.

In the past the circuit has hosted the FIA GT Championship, Speedcar Series, Australian V8 Supercars, GP2 Asia Series, and a one-off Bahrain Superprix involving Formula Three cars, following on from the collapsed Korea Super Prix. The first ever Formula BMW World Final took place in Bahrain.

<doc id="944366" wikidata="Q83567658" url="?curid=944366" title="Majesty of the Seas">
<text>Majesty of the Seas was a owned and operated by Royal Caribbean International. She was built at the Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique shipyards in Saint-Nazaire, France, weighing 73,941 gross tons. She was placed in service on 26 April 1992 offerering 4- and 5-night Caribbean cruises, sailing from Florida. Her Godmother is Queen Sonja of Norway. In December 2020 she was sold to Seajets, renamed Majesty and laid up in Greece. Subsequently renamed Majesty of the Oceans, she is the only remaining &quot;Sovereign&quot;-class ship, although still out of service as of January 2025.

==Description==
The ship has a casino and 11 passenger elevators, two of which are glass-walled, various bars, two swimming pools, four hot tubs, a basketball court, and a rock climbing wall. The ship holds 2,350 guests at double occupancy and a maximum of 2,767 guests, and 833 crew members.

==Service history==

On 12 January 2007, &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot; entered a 4-week dry-dock period where she underwent a multimillion-dollar refurbishment of the pool decks, all public areas, restaurants, shops, centrum and cabins.

Plans to transfer &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot; to Pullmantur in 2016 had been announced on 21 November 2014, however in July 2015, Royal Caribbean reversed those plans, instead stating that &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot; would stay with Royal Caribbean International.

&quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot; was dry-docked after her 29 April 2016 cruise to receive several upgrades, a children&#x27;s water play area, a poolside movie screen, and modifications to the casino.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC reported, as early as 22 April 2020, that at least one person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was symptomatic while on board. From 14 March 2020 the ship&#x27;s cruising operations were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Sale to SeaJets==
In December 2020, Royal Caribbean sold &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot; to Seajets who renamed her &quot;Majesty&quot;. Seajets renamed the ship &quot;Majesty of the Oceans&quot; in April 2021, while still laid up at Piraeus. The ship is currently on sale for $33,000,000.00.

==Scale model==
A th scale model of &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot; was built in Morsbach, by François Zanella. The model was launched in 2005 and performs river cruises in and around Paris, France.

<doc id="944375" wikidata="Q1262066" url="?curid=944375" title="Illawarra Highway">
<text>Illawarra Highway is a short state highway in New South Wales, Australia. It connects Wollongong to the Southern Highlands and links Princes Highway and Hume Highway. It is named after the geographical area it crosses, the Illawarra region. 

==Route==
Illawarra Highway commences at the interchange with Hume Highway at Hoddles Cross Roads west of Sutton Forest and heads in a northeasterly direction as a two-lane, single-carriageway road until it reaches Moss Vale, after which it heads in an easterly direction through Robertson until it reaches the Macquarie Pass, where the road twists through hairpin curves as it descends the Illawarra escarpment through Macquarie Pass National Park and crosses the Macquarie Valley to the coastal region around Shellharbour. After passing through Tongarra, the highway eventually terminates at the interchange with Princes Motorway in Albion Park.

The Macquarie Pass, with many hairpin bends and steep gradients, is unsuitable for large and articulated vehicles: trucks are instead advised to use the Mount Ousley Road (route B88), also known as Picton Road. 

Both Robertson and Moss Vale are country towns with 19th-century buildings still intact, and Macquarie Pass has one of the southernmost stands of Australia&#x27;s sub tropical rainforest.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB). Main Road No. 260 was declared from the intersection with Hume Highway at the Cross Roads (today Hoddles Cross Roads) west of Sutton Forest to Moss Vale (and continuing north via Bowral to the intersection with Hume Highway at Mittagong), and Main Road No. 262 was declared from Moss Vale via Robertson and Macquarie Pass to the intersection with Princes Highway at Albion Park, on the same day, 8 August 1928.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, declared Trunk Road 88 on 28 March 1951, from Cross Roads via Moss Vale and Robertson to the intersection with Princes Highway 1 mile north of Albion Park railway station; the southern end of Main Road 260 was truncated to meet Trunk Road 88 at Moss Vale, and Main Road 262 was reduced to a 2.5km stretch between Albion Park and Albion Park railway station. This was replaced with the declaration of State Highway 25 along the same route on 4 July 1962, subsuming Trunk Road 88. State Highway 25 was named Illawarra Highway on 22 February 1967.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Illawarra Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 25, from Hoddles Cross Roads to Albion Park.

The route was allocated National Route 48 in 1974. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route A48.

<text>Soppressata is an Italian &quot;salume&quot; (cured meat product). Although there are many variations, two principal types are made: a cured dry sausage typical of Basilicata, Apulia, and Calabria, and a very different uncured salami made in Tuscany and Liguria. It is still part of southern Italian cultural heritage that local people (especially in the smaller rural towns) slaughter the pig themselves and use it all, with nothing going to waste, using some parts to make cured meats, including &quot;soppressata&quot;. It is sometimes prepared using prosciutto.

==Preparation==

==Varieties==

&quot;Soppressata di Basilicata&quot; is mainly produced in Rivello, Cancellara, Vaglio, and Lagonegro. &quot;Soppressata di Calabria&quot; enjoys protected designation of origin (PDO) status; the one produced in Acri and Decollatura is especially renowned. &quot;Soppressata di Puglia&quot; from Martina Franca is also very well-known.

&quot;Soppressata toscana&quot;, from Tuscany, is made from the leftover parts of the pig. First, the head is boiled for a few hours. When it is done, it is picked of meat and skin. All of the meat and skin, including the tongue, are chopped, seasoned, and then stuffed into a large casing. The cooking liquid is poured in to cover the mixture and it is then hung and the cooking liquid (high in gelatin) thickens to bind everything together. It is similar to the English brawn, Polish salceson, and German &quot;Presskopf&quot; (Austrian &quot;Presswurst&quot;).

&quot;Sopressa veneta&quot; (or just &quot;sopressa&quot;) got its name from the practice of pressing the salami between planks of wood resulting in a straight, flattened shape. It is a typical product of the Veneto region. &quot;Sopressa&quot; is a &quot;salume&quot;, typical of the Venetian culinary tradition and for this reason there are various types, such as &quot;sopressa trevigiana&quot;; &quot;sopressa vicentina&quot;, produced in the province of Vicenza, has been awarded the protected geographical status by the European Union. In order to protect &quot;sopressa vicentina&quot; from easy counterfeiting and for greater consumer protection, &quot;Consorzio di Tutela della Soprèssa Vicentina DOP&quot; has emerged, which brings together 4 local producers scattered around Vicenza. The northern Italian version from Vicenza, in Veneto, did away with the pressed shape and has become an international favorite.

<doc id="944386" wikidata="Q1738862" url="?curid=944386" title="Kenneth Dover">
<text>Sir Kenneth James Dover, (11 March 1920 – 7 March 2010) was a distinguished British classical scholar and academic. He was president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, from 1976 to 1986. In addition, he was president of the British Academy from 1978 to 1981, and chancellor of the University of St Andrews from 1981 to 2005. A scholar of Greek prose and Aristophanic comedy, he was also the author of &quot;Greek Homosexuality&quot; (1978), a key text on the subject.

== Life ==
Kenneth Dover was born in London, the only child of Percy Dover and Dorothy Healey. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and Balliol College, Oxford. He served with the Royal Artillery during the Second World War and was mentioned in dispatches for his service in Italy.

After military service, Dover returned to Oxford and became fellow and tutor at his old college in 1948. In 1955, Dover was appointed Professor of Greek at the University of St Andrews, and was twice dean of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Arts during his twenty-one years there.

He was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1975. Dover received a knighthood two years later for services to Greek scholarship. In 1976, Dover became president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, a post he held for ten years. During this tenure Dover was engaged in a protracted dispute with the college librarian and a fellow in history, Trevor Henry Aston (1925–1985), who suffered from manic depression. Dover attempted to help Aston with his problems for several years but Aston&#x27;s erratic behaviour increasingly exasperated him and matters came to a head in 1985. In &quot;Marginal Comment&quot;, his autobiography, Dover admitted: &quot;It was clear to me by now that Trevor and the college must somehow be separated. My problem was one which I feel compelled to define with brutal candour: How to kill him without getting into trouble ... I had no qualms about causing the death of a fellow from whose nonexistence the college would benefit, but I balked at the prospect of misleading a coroner&#x27;s jury ... consulting a lawyer to see if [I] would be legally at risk if [I] ignored a suicide call.&quot; Dover intentionally put pressure on Aston, but other factors too were in play, not least Aston&#x27;s receipt of divorce papers from his wife&#x27;s lawyers. Aston was found dead in his rooms on 17 October 1985 after an overdose.

In 1978, he was elected to the presidency of the British Academy, of which he had been a Fellow since 1966, and served for a term of three years. During the 1980s, he also held positions at Cornell University and Stanford University.

Dover returned to St Andrews as the university&#x27;s chancellor in 1981. He was the first chancellor in the university&#x27;s history to be neither a peer nor an archbishop. Dover stepped down from the position after twenty-five years of service, effective 31 December 2005.

== Scholarship ==
Dover&#x27;s scholarly work focused especially on Thucydides, Aristophanes, and Plato, on the stylistics of Greek prose, and on Greek sexual morality. In addition to smaller editions of Thucydides books 6 and 7, he completed (with Antony Andrewes) the fourth and fifth volumes of the &quot;Historical Commentary on Thucydides&quot; begun by A.W. Gomme and left unfinished at his death. (The complete work is often referred to as &quot;Gomme-Andrewes-Dover.&quot;) His work on Aristophanes included two editions with commentary (on &quot;Clouds&quot; and &quot;Frogs&quot;) and a book on &quot;Aristophanic Comedy&quot; aimed at a more general readership.

His interest in stylistics stretches from his early study of &quot;Greek Word Order&quot; (1960) to his last major book, &quot;The Evolution of Greek Prose Style&quot; (1997). He had previously been responsible for supervising the second edition of J.D. Denniston&#x27;s &quot;The Greek Particles&quot; (1950); though Dover is not named on the title page, his signed preface notes that he made various cuts, additions and changes. His series of Sather lectures on the corpus of speeches attributed to Lysias was important for its early application of stylometry to the study of Greek texts, as well as its agnostic conclusions. Since Athenian speechwriters adapted their style to the personality of their clients, Dover argued, it is difficult to make firm judgments about the authorship of speeches on the basis of style.

Dover&#x27;s &quot;Greek Homosexuality&quot; (1978) marked a watershed in the study of classical Greek society, discussing topics such as pederasty and what he memorably called &quot;intercrural copulation&quot; in matter-of-fact terms. In particular, Dover made use of copious evidence from vase painting as a counterweight to the idealized picture of homoerotic relationships found in Plato.

A collection of papers on Dover&#x27;s career, &quot;Scholarship and Controversy: Centenary Essays on the Life and Work of Sir Kenneth Dover&quot;, edited by Stephen Halliwell and Christopher Stray, was published in 2023.

== Honorary degrees ==
Dover received honorary degrees from the Universities of Oxford, St Andrews, Birmingham, Bristol, London, Durham, Liverpool, and Oglethorpe. He was also a foreign member of the American and the Royal Netherlands Academies of Arts and Sciences since 1979.

== Hobbies ==
Beyond his academic honours and pursuits, Dover was well known for his skill and devotion to bird watching and was considered one of Britain&#x27;s finest birders. As president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in the 1970s and 80s he was impressive for being able to greet all Corpuscles by name. He achieved this by studying photographs and admitted to having occasional problems identifying new students when beards were in fashion.

== Media appearances and controversy ==
Dover was the subject of an edition of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;In the Psychiatrist&#x27;s Chair&quot;, presented by Anthony Clare. He also featured in a BBC Television series &quot;The Greeks&quot;, presented by Christopher Burstall.

In 1994 he published a controversial autobiography entitled &quot;Marginal Comment&quot; (republished, with additional editorial material, in 2023). This prompted media attention because of its frank description of his private life, and Dover&#x27;s admission of having contemplated helping to bring about the death of one of the fellows of Corpus Christi College, the historian Trevor Aston, by refusing to respond to a suicide attempt.

== Family ==
Dover resided in St Andrews, Fife, where he and his family had a home from around 1960. He married Audrey Ruth Latimer in March 1947; Lady Dover died in December 2009 after 62 years of marriage. Dover died in Cupar on 7 March 2010, survived by a son and daughter.

<doc id="944387" wikidata="Q6437077" url="?curid=944387" title="The Destruction of the European Jews">
<text>The Destruction of the European Jews is a 1961 book by historian Raul Hilberg. Hilberg revised his work in 1985, and it appeared in a new three-volume edition. It is largely held to be the first comprehensive historical study of the Holocaust. According to Holocaust historian, Michael R. Marrus (&quot;The Holocaust in History&quot;), until the book appeared, little information about the genocide of the Jews by Nazi Germany had &quot;reached the wider public&quot; in both the West and the East, and even in pertinent scholarly studies it was &quot;scarcely mentioned or only mentioned in passing as one more atrocity in a particularly cruel war&quot;.

Hilberg&#x27;s &quot;landmark synthesis, based on a masterful reading of German documents&quot;, soon led to a massive array of writings and debates, both scholarly and popular, on the Holocaust. Two works which preceded Hilberg&#x27;s by a decade, but remained little known in their time, were Léon Poliakov&#x27;s &quot;Bréviaire de la haine&quot; (Harvest of Hate), published in 1951, and Gerald Reitlinger&#x27;s &quot;The Final Solution&quot;, published in 1953.

Discussing the writing of &quot;Destruction&quot; in his autobiography, Hilberg wrote: &quot;No literature could serve me as an example. The destruction of the Jews was an unprecedented occurrence, a primordial act that had not been imagined before it burst forth. The Germans had no model for their deed, and I did not have one for my narrative.&quot;

==Written with support, published with difficulties==
Hilberg began his study of the Holocaust leading to &quot;The Destruction&quot; while stationed in Munich in 1948 for the U.S. Army&#x27;s War Documentation Project. He proposed the idea for the work as a PhD. dissertation and was supported in this by his doctoral advisor, Columbia University professor Franz Neumann.

While the dissertation won a prize, Columbia University Press, Princeton University Press, Oklahoma University Press, as well as Yad Vashem all declined to publish it. It was eventually published by a small publishing company, Quadrangle Books. This first edition was published in an unusually small type. Much of the page count increase of later versions is due to being published in a conventional type size. This was not the end of Hilberg&#x27;s publishing woes. It was not translated until 1982, when Ulf Wolter of the small leftist publishers Olle &amp; Wolter in Berlin published a German translation. For this purpose the work was enlarged by about 15%, so that Hilberg spoke of a &quot;second edition&quot;, &quot;solid enough for the next century&quot;.

===Opposition from Hannah Arendt===
In his autobiography, Hilberg reveals learning that Hannah Arendt advised Princeton University Press against publishing &quot;The Destruction&quot;. This may have been due to the first chapter, which she later described as &quot;very terrible&quot; and betraying little understanding of German history. She did, however, base her account of the Final Solution (in &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;) on Hilberg&#x27;s history, as well as sharing his controversial characterisation of the Judenrat. Hilberg strongly criticized Arendt&#x27;s &quot;banality of evil&quot; thesis which appeared shortly after &quot;The Destruction&quot;, to be published with her articles for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; with respect to Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s trial (&quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;). He still defended Arendt&#x27;s right to have her views aired upon being condemned by the Anti-Defamation League. In fact, David Cesarani writes that Hilberg &quot;defended her several arguments at a bitter debate organised by &quot;Dissent&quot; magazine which drew an audience of hundreds&quot;. In a letter to the German philosopher Karl Jaspers, Arendt went on to write that:

Hilberg also goes on to claim that Nora Levin heavily borrowed from &quot;The Destruction&quot; without acknowledgment in her 1968 &quot;The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry&quot;, and that historian Lucy Davidowicz not only ignored &quot;The Destruction&quot;&#x27;s findings in her 1975 &quot;The War against the Jews, 1933–1945&quot; but also went on to exclude mention of him, along with a galaxy of other leading Holocaust scholars, in her 1981 historiographic work, &quot;The Holocaust and the Historians&quot;. &quot;She wanted preeminence&quot;, Hilberg writes.

=== Opposition from Yad Vashem ===
Hilberg&#x27;s work received a hostile reception from Yad Vashem, particularly over his treatment of Jewish resistance to the perpetrators of the Holocaust in the book&#x27;s concluding chapter. Hilberg argued that &quot;The reaction pattern of the Jews is characterized by almost complete lack of resistance...[T]he documentary evidence of Jewish resistance, overt or submerged, is very slight&quot;. Hilberg attributed this lack of resistance to the Jewish experience as a minority: &quot;In exile, the Jews... had learned that they could avert danger and survive destruction by placating and appeasing their enemies...Thus over a period of centuries the Jews had learned that in order to survive they had to restrain from resistance&quot;. Yad Vashem&#x27;s scholars, including Josef Melkman and Nathan Eck, did not feel that Hilberg&#x27;s characterizations of Jewish history were correct, but they also felt that by using Jewish history to explain the reaction of the Jewish community to the Holocaust, Hilberg was suggesting that some responsibility for the extent of the destruction fell on the Jews themselves, a position that they found unacceptable. The 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, and the subsequent publication by Hannah Arendt and Bruno Bettelheim of works that were more critical of Jewish actions during the Holocaust than Hilberg had been, inflamed the controversy. In 1967, Nathan Eck wrote a sharply critical review of Hilberg, Arendt, and Bettelheim&#x27;s claims in &quot;Yad Vashem Studies&quot;, the organization&#x27;s research journal, titled &quot;Historical Research or Slander&quot;.

Hilberg eventually reached a reconciliation with Yad Vashem, and participated in international conferences organized by the institution in 1977 and 2004.
In 2012 Yad Vashem held a symposium marking the translation of his book into Hebrew.

==Against overstating the heroism of Jewish victims==
A key reason as to why notable Jews and organizations were hostile to Hilberg&#x27;s work was that &quot;The Destruction&quot; relied most of all on German documents, whereas Jewish accounts and sources were featured far less prominently. This, argued Hilberg&#x27;s opponents, trivialized the suffering Jews endured under Nazism. For his part, Hilberg maintains that these sources simply could not have been central to a systematic, social-scientific reconstruction of the destruction process.

Another important factor for this hostility by many in the Jewish community (including some Holocaust survivors) is that Hilberg refused to view the vast majority of Jewish victims&#x27; &quot;passivity&quot; as a form of heroism or resistance (in contrast to those Jews who actively resisted, waging armed struggle against the Nazis). Equally controversially, he provided an analysis for this passivity in the context of Jewish history. The Jews, Hilberg argued, were convinced &quot;the persecutor would not destroy what he could economically exploit.&quot; Hilberg calculated the economic value of Jewish slave labor to the Nazis as being several times the entire value of confiscated Jewish assets, and used this as evidence that the destruction of Jews continued irrespective of economic considerations. Additionally, Hilberg estimated the total number of Germans killed by Jews during World War II as less than 300, an estimate that is not conducive to an image of heroic struggle.

Hilberg, therefore, disagreed with what he termed a &quot;campaign of exaltation&quot;, explains historian Mitchell Hart, and with Holocaust historians such as Martin Gilbert who argued that &quot;[e]ven passivity was a form of resistance[,] to die with dignity was a form of resistance.&quot; According to Hilberg, his own approach was crucial for grasping the Nazi genocide of Jews as a process. Hart adds that:

This sort of &quot;inflation of resistance&quot; is dangerous because it suggests that the Jews truly did present the Nazis with some sort of &quot;opposition&quot; that was not just a horrible figment of their antisemitic imaginations.

==The Destruction of the Jews as a historically explicable event==
This problem underscores a more fundamental question: whether the Holocaust can (or to what extent it &quot;should&quot;) be made explicable through a social-scientific, historical account. Speaking against what he terms a &quot;quasi mystical association,&quot; historian Nicolas Kinloch writes that &quot;with the publication of Raul Hilberg&#x27;s monumental book,&quot; the subject had risen to be considered &quot;an event requiring more, rather than less, stringent historical analysis.&quot; Citing Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer&#x27;s statement that &quot;if the Holocaust was caused by humans, then it is as understandable as any other human event&quot;, Kinloch finally concludes that this &quot;will itself help to make any repetition of the Nazi genocide less likely&quot;.

One danger, however, from this attempt to &quot;demystify&quot;, argues Arno Lustiger, can lead to another mystification proffering &quot;clichés about the behaviour of the doomed Jews [which depict] their alleged cowardliness, compliance, submission, collaboration and lack of passive or armed resistance&quot;. He goes on to echo the early critics of (the no longer marginalized) Hilberg, stating that: &quot;it is about time to publish researched testimonies of the victims and survivors [as opposed to those] documentations and books, based solely on German documents.&quot;

An altogether different argument challenged the view that since the Nazis destroyed massive sets of sensitive documents pertaining to the Holocaust upon the arrival of Soviet and Western Allied troops, no truly comprehensive, verifiable historical reconstruction could be achieved. This, however, argues Hilberg, demonstrates an ignorance as to the structure and scope of the Nazi bureaucracy. While it is true that many sensitive documents were destroyed, the bureaucracy nonetheless was so immense and so dispersed, that most pertinent materials could be reconstructed either from copies or from a vast array of more peripheral ones.

From these documents, &quot;The Destruction&quot; proceeds to outline the treatment of the Jews by the Nazi State through a succession of very different stages, each one more extreme, more dehumanizing than that which preceded it, eventually leading to the final stage: the physical destruction of the European Jews.

==Stages leading to the destruction process==
In &quot;The Destruction&quot;, Hilberg established what today has become orthodoxy in Holocaust historiography: the increasingly intensifying historical stages leading to genocide. Nazi Germany&#x27;s persecution of Jews, Hilberg argued, began relatively mildly through political-legal discrimination and the appropriation of Jewish assets (1933–39). Ghettoization followed: the isolation of Jews in and their confinement to Ghettoes (1939–41). The final stage, Hilberg concluded, was the destruction itself, the continental annihilation of European Jews (1941–45).

In the early stages, Nazi policies targeting Jews (whether directly or through aryanization) treated them as sub-human, but with a right to live under such conditions that this status affords. In the later stages, policy was formulated to define the Jews as anti-human, with extermination being viewed as an increasingly urgent necessity. The growing Nazi momentum of destruction, began with the murdering of Jews in German and German-annexed and occupied countries, and then intensified into a search for Jews to either exterminate or use as forced labour from countries allied with Nazi Germany as well as neutral countries.

The more sophisticated and organized, less clandestine part of the Nazi machinery of destruction tended to murder Jews not fit for intense manual labour immediately; later in the destruction process, more and more Jews initially labelled productive were also murdered. Eventually, Nazi compulsion for the eradication of the Jews became total and absolute, with any potentially available Jews being actively sought solely for the purpose of destruction.

The seamless transformation from yet inextricable distinction between these stages, could be realized only through and put into practice by this very compounding process of an ever-growing dehumanization. As demonized as the Jews were, it seems highly unlikely that the destruction process of the later stage could take place during the time line of the stage which preceded it.

== An intentional destruction ==
This dynamic reveals a spontaneity which many historians belonging to the &quot;functionalist&quot; school, following Hilberg&#x27;s elaborate description, relied upon. These historians point to the more clandestine mass murder of Jews (principally in the East) and, as stated by notable functionalist, Martin Broszat, because &quot;no general all encompassing directive for the extermination had existed.&quot;

Unlike many later scholars, &quot;The Destruction&quot; does not emphasize and focus on the role of Hitler, though on this, Hilberg has shifted more towards the centre, with the third edition pointing at a less direct and systemic, more erratic and sporadic, but nonetheless pivotal, involvement by Hitler in his support for the destruction process.

Hitler was a crucial impetus for the genocide, Hilberg claimed, but the role played by the organs of the State and the Nazi Party should not be understated. Hitler, therefore, intended to eradicate the Jews, an intent he sometimes phrased in concrete terms, but often this intent on the part of Hitler was interpreted by rather than dictated to those at the helm of the bureaucratic machinery of destruction which administered and carried out the genocide of the Jews.

== An estimated destruction of 5.1 million Jews ==
Within a death toll often viewed as ranging from a low estimate of five million to a high estimate of seven million, Hilberg&#x27;s own detailed breakdown in &quot;The Destruction&quot; reveals a total estimated death toll of 5.1 million Jews. Only for the death toll at Belzec does Hilberg provide a precise figure; all the others are rounded. When these rounding factors are taken into account, a range of 4.9 million to 5.4 million deaths emerges.

It is instructive to note that the discrepancy in total figures among Holocaust researchers is often overshadowed by that between Soviet and Western scholarship. One striking example can be seen in the Auschwitz State Museum&#x27;s significant reduction of the estimated death toll in Auschwitz. On May 12, 1945, a few months after the liberation of Auschwitz, a Soviet State Commission reported that no fewer than four million people were murdered there. Although few scholars west of the Iron Curtain accepted this report, this number was displayed on a plaque at the Auschwitz State Museum until the fall of communism in 1991, when it could be revised to 1.1 million. Hilberg&#x27;s own original estimate for the death toll in Auschwitz was examined although, Piper noted, this estimate fails to account for those not appearing in the records, especially those murdered immediately upon arrival. This extreme example does not, however, mean that the total death toll should be lowered by three million. Rather, the four million figure should be regarded as Soviet propaganda; following a correct distribution, the total death toll still amounts to conventionally held figures. The role played by &quot;The Destruction&quot; in shaping widely held views as to the distribution of and the evidence for these, has for decades been, and arguably remains, almost canonical in Holocaust historiography.

==Wide acclamation as seminal==
Reviewing the book just after publication, Guggenheim Fellow Andreas Dorpalen wrote that Hilberg had &quot;covered his topic with such thoroughness that his book will long remain a basic source of information on this tragic subject.&quot; Today, &quot;The Destruction&quot; has achieved a highly distinguished level of prestige amongst Holocaust historians. While its ideas have been modified (including by Hilberg himself) and criticized throughout four decades, few in the field dispute its being a monumental work, in both originality and scope. Reviewing the appreciably expanded 1,440-page second edition, Holocaust historian Christopher Browning noted that Hilberg &quot;has improved a classic, not an easy task.&quot; And while Browning maintains that, with the exception of Hitler&#x27;s role, there are no fundamental changes to the work&#x27;s principal findings, he nevertheless states that:

The controversies surrounding Hilberg&#x27;s book were perhaps the main reason why its Polish translation was released only after the collapse of the Soviet union, five decades after its original publication. The year Hilberg died, he refused an offer to have a shortened version published in translation, insisting that particularly in Poland, where so much of the Holocaust took place, only the full text of his work would suffice. The complete three-volume edition translated by Jerzy Giebułtowski was released in Poland in 2013. Dariusz Libionka from IPN, who led the book launch seminars in various cities, noted that the stories of defiance so prevalent in Poland can no longer be told without his perspective which includes the viewpoint of Holocaust bureaucracy. Reportedly, the last document Hilberg signed before his death was the release form allowing for the use of the word &quot;annihilation&quot; (as opposed to &quot;destruction&quot;) in the Polish title.

==Alleged mistakes==
According to Henry Friedlander, Hilberg&#x27;s 1961 and 1985 editions of &quot;Destruction&quot; mistakenly overlooked what Friedlander called &quot;the most elaborate [Nazi] subterfuge&quot; involving the disabled. This involved the collection of Jewish patients at various hospitals before being transported elsewhere and killed during the summer and autumn of 1940.

Friedlander discusses this ruse in Chapter 13 of his &quot;Origins of Nazi Genocide&quot; (1995).

According to Lithuanian-American scholar Saulius Sužiedėlis, Hilberg misinterpreted a document regarding Algirdas Klimaitis, &quot;a small-time journalist and killer shunned by even pro-Nazi Lithuanian elements and unknown to most Lithuanians&quot;. This resulted in Klimaitis being inadvertently &quot;transformed into the head of the &#x27;anti-Soviet partisans.

<doc id="944388" wikidata="Q115383" url="?curid=944388" title="Plato (crater)">
<text>Plato is a lava-filled lunar impact crater on the Moon. Its diameter is 101 km. It was named after ancient Greek philosopher Plato. It is located on the northeastern shore of the Mare Imbrium, at the western extremity of the Montes Alpes mountain range. In the mare to the south are several rises collectively named the Montes Teneriffe. To the north lies the wide stretch of the Mare Frigoris. East of the crater, among the Montes Alpes, are several rilles collectively named the Rimae Plato.

The age of Plato is about 3.84 billion years, only slightly younger than the Mare Imbrium to the south. The rim is irregular with 2-km-tall jagged peaks that project prominent shadows across the crater floor when the Sun is at a low angle. Sections of the inner wall display signs of past slumping, most notably a large triangular slide along the western side. The rim of Plato is circular, but from the Earth it appears oval due to foreshortening.

The flat floor of Plato has a relatively low albedo, making it appear dark in comparison to the surrounding rugged terrain. The floor is free of significant impact craters and lacks a central peak. However, there are a few small craterlets scattered across the floor.

Its northwest rim is characterised by a very high rockfall density by lunar standards.

Plato is one of the largest craters of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

Plato has developed a reputation for transient lunar phenomena, including flashes of light, unusual colour patterns, and areas of hazy visibility. These anomalies are likely a result of seeing conditions, combined with the effects of different illumination angles of the Sun.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Plato.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU:
* Plato A — &quot;See&quot; Bliss (crater).

==Plato in fiction==
The crater Plato is the location of an observatory in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Earthlight&quot; (1955), of the lunar &quot;warren&quot; Hong Kong Luna in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (1966), and of Moonbase Alpha in the science-fiction TV series &quot;&quot;.

Crater Plato is the home crater of Matthew Looney and Maria Looney, protagonists of the Looney series of children&#x27;s books set on the Moon, written by Jerome Beatty.

<text>Mini-VGA connectors are proprietary and non-standard alternative video connectors that were used on some laptops and other computer systems in place of a standard VGA connector. Apple, HP, and Asus each introduced separate connectors using the same moniker of &quot;mini-VGA&quot;, but which are otherwise physically incompatible with each other (though &quot;all&quot; of them are compatible with standard VGA using the correct adapter).

Apple&#x27;s mini-VGA ports may be found on some older Apple computers, including iBooks, eMacs, certain PowerBooks (e.g.: 12-inch), and some iMacs (e.g.: the iMac G5). In addition to a more compact form-factor, Apple&#x27;s mini-VGA ports also have the added ability to output composite as well as S-Video, in addition to VGA signals, through the use of EDID. When used for S-Video, S-Video&#x27;s chrominance (C) and luminance (Y) signals replace VGA&#x27;s red (R) and green (G) channels, while for composite video, the signal is output through VGA&#x27;s blue (B) channel. (The horizontal and vertical sync pins of VGA are left unused.)

HP&#x27;s version of mini-VGA can be found in HP Minis and HP TouchSmarts. Samsung Chromebooks, as released in June 2011, feature their own implementation of mini-VGA. Various other Samsung laptops, such as the Series 7 and Series 9, also featured this new connector. Mini-VGA ports can also be found on several laptops previously manufactured by Sony.

With the introduction of mini-DVI, as well as Mini DisplayPort, mini-VGA connectors were largely superseded in favor of these newer, more versatile connector types.

<doc id="944390" wikidata="Q3173830" url="?curid=944390" title="Les Lavandières">
<text>Les Lavandières, or the Midnight Washerwomen, are three old washerwomen in Celtic mythology. Names in various Celtic languages include the &quot;kannerezed noz&quot; in Brittany and the &quot;Bean nighe&quot; in Gaelic. They can also be found in the Celtic folklore of Iberia as &quot;Las Lavanderas&quot; in Cantabria, &quot;As lavandeiras&quot; in Galicia or &quot;Les Llavanderes&quot; in Asturias, and in Portugal are known as &quot;Bruxas lavadeiras &quot;. The three old women go to the water&#x27;s edge at midnight to wash shrouds for those about to die, according to the myth and folklore of Brittany; or to wash the bloodstained clothing of those who are about to die, according to Celtic mythology. The Midnight Washerwomen may be related to the old Celtic tradition of the triple goddess of death and slaughter.

The washerwomen are small, dressed in green and have webbed feet. Their webbed feet may be the reason they are also sometimes called the &quot;cannard noz&quot; (meaning &quot;night ducks&quot;) in Breton folklore.

==France==
In the nineteenth century, the belief in night washerwomen was very present in Brittany and Normandy, but it is also attested in many other regions of France: Berry, Pyrenees, Alps, Alsace, Morvan, Creuse, Burgundy and Ariège.

An important number of Romantic French authors and poets wrote about the lavandières, from Guy de Maupassant and Victor Hugo to George Sand.

===Brittany===

In Brittany, legends of the &quot;lavandière de la nuit&quot; were attested by Jacques Cambry as early as the 18th century.

In Brittany, they can be an ominous portent, foretelling death, either one&#x27;s own or a death in the family, though it is rare, just like they are not always represented as old women, though they always have very pale skin, being creatures of the night, and are often dressed in white or in traditional clothing. They are very agile and strong physically, even when they do not look so.

The Breton washerwomen wash graveclothes, usually at night, under the moonlight, and are notable for their intense dislike of being disturbed, cursing those who dare to do so. They are known to ask passers-by for help in wringing clothes, breaking the arms of those who do so reluctantly and drowning those who refuse. More rarely, they can also give charity.

According to the Breton legends, the washerwomen can either be ghosts whose name is known to all or else they are anonymous supernatural beings who appear in a human form. It is encountered during the year in the evening or in the middle of the night in known places (laundrette, creek), sometimes during the nights of full moon, sometimes only on the eve of the feast of the dead (All Saints&#x27; Day).

Numerous folk tales on the subject have been collected during the 19th and 20th century. In Breton, the washerwomen are collectively known as &quot;ar c’hannerezed-noz, ar c’houerezed-noz&quot; or &quot;ar vaouez o welc’hin&quot;. The late written tales we have of the Lavendières do not allow us to know with certainty if they have the same mythological origin as the &quot;bean nighe&quot;.

According to a Breton tradition, they are deceased who were buried in a dirty shroud:

==Ireland==
In Ireland, they are an ominous portent, foretelling death, either one&#x27;s own or a death in the family. The washerwomen of Ireland wash the bloodied shirts of those about to die.

==Scotland==
In Scotland, if one can get between the washerwomen and the water, they are required to grant three wishes in exchange for three questions answered truthfully. There is also a tradition in Scotland of a single washer at the ford, the goddess Clotha, who gives the River Clyde its name.

==Wales and Cornwall==
In Wales and Cornwall a passerby must avoid being seen by the washerwomen. If they do get seen however, they are required to help wring out the sheets. If they twist the sheets in the same direction as the washerwomen, the individual&#x27;s arms will be wrenched from their sockets and they will get pulled into the wet sheets and killed instantly. If, however, they twist in the opposite direction, the washerwomen are required to grant the person three wishes.

<doc id="944391" wikidata="Q1703310" url="?curid=944391" title="List of Captain Tsubasa characters">
<text>This is a list of characters who appear in anime, videogames and manga of &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;. Due to differences between anime, manga, and games of &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;, some characters appear only in one series.

==Characters==
===Tsubasa Oozora===

Tsubasa Oozora, aka Oliver Atom, is one of the series&#x27; main protagonists.

===Genzo Wakabayashi===

Genzo Wakabayashi (若林 源三, kana: わかばやし げんぞう) is the secondary protagonist, and the first rival to Tsubasa in the series and considered Japan&#x27;s greatest goalkeeper. He first played as Shutetsu&#x27;s goalkeeper and became a rival to Tsubasa, but after a match between Nankatsu and Shutetsu, they became good friends. An injury forbids him from playing most of the national championships along with his teammates at Nankatsu, but he returns, helping the team in defeating Meiwa. Wakabayashi later leaves for Germany to play for Hamburger SV where he meets Karl-Heinz Schneider and Hermann Kaltz, the former whom becomes a rival to him. He&#x27;s later recruited by Mikami to play for the U-16 World Cup in France, but only plays in the finals against West Germany since Ken Wakashimazu was injured. He also joins the U-20 Japanese team in the World Youth arc, but injuries on both hands caused by Stefan Levin and Bryan Cruyfford prevent him from playing any matches. Fully recovered after the match with Italy, he gets his revenge on Levin and Cruyfford in the matches against Sweden and Holland and also plays in the finals against Brazil, only to get injured in the second half and to be replaced by Wakashimazu. After a Bundesliga match between Hamburger SV and Schneider&#x27;s Bayern Munich, he&#x27;s suspended from playing any further matches. He joins the U-22 and Olympic Japanese teams in the Golden-23 and Rising Sun arcs after recovering from an injury in his eye. After Japan beats Germany in the Olympic Games, Wakabayashi decides to join Schneider at Bayern Munich so that they can win the UEFA Champions League.

===Kojiro Hyuga===

Kojiro Hyuga (日向 小次郎, kana: ひゅうが こじろう) is the secondary protagonist, a forward and the ace striker for the Japanese national team. Coming from a poor family from Saitama, Hyuga lost his father at a young age so he had to take part-time jobs to help out his family. Although he can be quite hot-headed and arrogant, he&#x27;s a very nice person, particularly towards his family and his teammates Takeshi Sawada and Ken Wakashimazu. After losing the elementary school tournament against Nankatsu, Hyuga, along with Sawada and Wakashimazu, joins Toho Academy, but fails to win the middle school tournament two times, only managing to get a win, sharing it with Nankatsu. He&#x27;s recruited for the U-16 Japanese team and plays in all the matches, scoring the most goals. Later in high school, he wins three consecutive tournaments for Toho. He&#x27;s taken off from the U-20 Japan team because he lacked post play. Aside from developing post play, he creates the Raiju Shoot, a shoot more powerful than his Tiger Shoot and develops a relationship with Maki Akamine, a softball player. He returns to the team and plays in the subsequent matches of the Asian preliminaries and the World Youth. He then signs a contract with Juventus FC but is taken off the team because of his poor balance and is loaned to Reggiana from Serie C he is a tiger.

===Taro Misaki===

Taro Misaki (岬 太郎, kana: みさき たろう) is the secondary protagonist, a midfielder for the Japanese national team, who forms the Golden Combi with Tsubasa. He&#x27;s the son of a landscape painter who travels around the world. Because his father is always travelling, he&#x27;s unable to make long-term friends. Before meeting Tsubasa and the rest of the Nankatsu players, he played with Meiwa and Furano. During the national championship, he and Tsubasa became close friends aside from forming the Golden Combi. After winning the national championship, he left with his father to France, not wanting to live with his mother, who had married another man and gave birth to a daughter. He reunites with Tsubasa in the International Junior Youth Tournament in France and also finds a rival in Pierre. He returns to Japan and plays for the Nankatsu team in high school for three years, only to lose three times for Toho Academy. In the World Youth arc, he&#x27;s taken off from the team by Coach Gamo, but returns to the team after travelling around the world. Unfortunately before the World Youth, Misaki gets his left leg broken in a car accident while saving his half-sister. Despite his leg not being fully healed, he plays in the finals against Brazil, assisting in Tsubasa&#x27;s hat-trick. He currently plays for Jubilo Iwata in the J-League and in the Golden-23 and Rising Sun arc, he plays for the U-22 and Olympic Japan teams.

===Hikaru Matsuyama===
Hikaru Matsuyama (松山光, kana: まつやま ひかる) is the secondary protagonist, either a defender or a midfielder for the Japanese national team. Whenever Tsubasa is not playing for Japan, he&#x27;ll serve as captain. He first appeared in the national tournament as the captain of Furano and faced off against Meiwa in the semi-finals, but lost because his shot was stopped by Ken Wakashimazu. A few years later, he fought against Tsubasa&#x27;s Nankatsu in the semi-finals, but failed once again. Matsuyama&#x27;s then selected for the U-16 Japan team and serves as captain after a disastrous match against Hamburg SV, only to give the captain to Tsubasa. He continues to play for Furano in high school and begins to date Yoshiko Fujisawa (who had left for the United States because of her father&#x27;s work). During the hard times of the Japan U-20 team, he contributes a lot to the team so that they do not fall apart. During the battle of World Youth arc, he was the first to find out about the RF7 challenge set by Gamo. He&#x27;s absent for most of the quarter-finals match against Sweden because Yoshiko was involved in a car accident, but he returns to replace an injured Akai Tomeya and has a key in helping Japan win. In the Road to 2002 series, he plays for Consadole Sapporo and ties against Misugi, who now plays for FC Tokyo.

In Golden 23, Matsuyama was selected for the Japanese Olympics team as the captain. Coach Kira put a lot of trust in him, Misaki and Misugi, called the &quot;3M&quot; (3 Shooting Stars) of U-22 Japan, allowing them to handle the team&#x27;s balance. He believed that Matsuyama&#x27;s leadership would be important during the Asian preliminaries tournament.

===Jun Misugi===
Jun Misugi (三杉 淳, Misugi Jun, kana: みすぎ じゅん) is the secondary protagonist, a Japanese player who is first introduced as a prodigy from the Musashi high school soccer team. Despite being one of the most skilled Japanese players of his generation, Misugi is pushed back by a heart disease that makes him only work for few time per matches. It&#x27;s said that if Misugi was not hampered by his heart disease, he would have been the best Japanese player, even better than Tsubasa. He overcomes his heart disease by not playing for three years during high school and becomes a valuable player for the Japanese team in the Asian preliminaries and in the World Youth. At first, he played for Bellmare Hiratsuka, but then joined FC Tokyo. In the J-League, he faces off against Consadole Sapporo, led by Matsuyama, but they tie and both acknowledge each other&#x27;s skills. He&#x27;s currently playing for Olympic Japan in the Madrid Olympics soccer tournament and is not yet engaged to his girlfriend Yayoi Aoba.

===Shingo Aoi=== 
Shingo Aoi (葵 新伍, Aoi Shingo, kana: あおい しんご) is a midfielder for the Japanese national team that forms the Golden Trio with Tsubasa and Misaki. He wanted to quit soccer after his team Nakahara FC lost against Nankatsu, but Tsubasa urged him not to. He joins Inter Juniors, but with the exception of goalkeeper Gino Hernandez and the kit manager Calimero, no one likes him and bully him so that he can leave. They finally accept him when he helps them win a match. Coach Minato Gamo of Japan U-20 calls him to help Japan in the first rounds of the Asian Tournament, claiming him to be his trump card. He remains a valuable member throughout the World Youth arc. He forms a rivalry with Salvatore Gentile, who is considered to be Italy&#x27;s greatest líbero. He&#x27;s disappointed when Italy&#x27;s unable to defeat Uruguay because Hernandez and Gentile were injured by Ryoma Hino&#x27;s Tornado Shoot. In the match against Italy, he plays full force that Hernandez and Gentile decide to play in the last minutes. In the final match against Brazil, he forms a trio with Tsubasa and Misaki. After Japan&#x27;s win in the World Youth, he&#x27;s bought by FC Albese from Serie C because he could not secure a place in Inter Milan. In the final match of Serie C, he faces off against Hyuga, who is playing for Reggiana, and although he fights with all he has, he loses. He&#x27;s currently playing for Olympic Japan in the Rising Sun arc.

===Ryo Ishizaki===
Ryo Ishizaki (石崎 了, kana: いしざき りょう) is introduced as the captain of the until then very unsuccessful Nankatsu elementary school team. He is one of the moral pillars of the grade school team and the Japan team. For Japan, he usually wears the jerseys #14 or #4. His position is that of a defense and often tends to block a ball with his face.

Biography

At first, he is not as good at football as the other players, prone to errors. This clumsy personality was even reinforced in the 1983 anime, but in later series specially the 2018 anime we can see that Ishizaki can make up for every mistake with his guts - at his nickname clearly states - and has grown up to win his place as a regular in Japan Jr., a feat recognized by both Tsubasa and the Nankatsu gang at the end of the 16th national tournament.
Despite not having a special shot or dribble skills, his extra efforts on-field are compared to those Matsuyama&#x27;s in terms of teamwork and strategy sense gained due to pure training. In Nankatsu Public, Ishizaki progressed much and became the captain of the football team.
During the Madrid Olympics tournament, Ishizaki&#x27;s overlaps are even more decisive, his individual technique improved to the point he can dodge and outsmart opponents, he helped in scoring important goals, even an assist is credited to him.

Personality

Ishizaki is Tsubasa&#x27;s first friend in Nankatsu and known for his gutsy, cheerful and straightforward personality. In words of Tsubasa himself, he was the reason why he did not leave Nankatsu for entering Toho Academy. Much like Misaki &amp; Wakabayashi, he can lift up Tsubasa when the latter is down. He has also some comic-relief moments, specially in the anime. He tends to have quarrels with both Urabe and his girlfriend Yukari due to their explosive personalities.

He is currently playing for Jubilo Iwata and Olympic Japan in the Rising Sun arc.

===Ken Wakashimazu=== 
Ken Wakashimazu (若島津 健, kana: わかしまづ けん) is one of the reserve goalkeepers and a forward for Japan. The son of a dojo owner, he uses his karate skills and speed as a goalkeeper. He helps Meiwa defeat Furano in the semi-finals of the national tournament, but loses to Nankatsu in the finals. Along with Takeshi Sawada, he joins Kojiro Hyuga to the Toho Academy where they lose two championships to Nankatsu, but manage to win the third, sharing the win with the other team. He&#x27;s recruited to be part of the U-16 Japan team that will participate in the U-16 World Cup in France. During a match against Hamburg SV, he suffers an injury that only gets worse in the semi-finals against France. He later continues to play for Toho and is selected to be part of the U-20 team, but after refusing to be a reserve goalkeeper for Wakabayashi, he leaves the team to play for the Yokohama Fluegels in the J-League but later returns to the team, playing in the matches against Mexico, Uruguay and Italy. He currently plays for the Nagoya Grampus Eight and plays as a forward for the U-22 and Olympic Japan teams (something that Coach Kira always wanted, a two-top with Hyuga).

===Takeshi Sawada===

Takeshi Sawada (沢田 タケシ, kana: さわだ タケシ) is a midfielder and one of the youngest members for the Japanese national team. During the national championship, he serves as vice captain for Meiwa FC and later serves a more important role for Toho Academy when Hyuga was forbidden to play. Although he is two years younger than the majority of the others, he joins the U-16, U-20 and Olympic Japanese teams. He plays for Urawa Red Diamonds, along with Hayato Igawa, who is Japan&#x27;s best libero. Takeshi had captained the U-19 side to win the U-19 Asian youth championship.

===Shun Nitta===

Shun Nitta (新田 瞬, kana: にった しゅん) is a forward for the Japanese national team known for his Hayabusa Shoot and one of the fastest characters in the series. Originally, he played for Nankatsu in elementary school, but in middle school, he played for Otomo along with Urabe, Kishida, Nakayama and Nishio, who also played for Nankatsu. They face off against Nankatsu in the finals of the regional tournament but lose 1 to 3. Nitta is then chosen for the U-16 Japanese team, playing against Italy, Argentina and West Germany. He returns to play for Nankatsu in high school and is later invited to play for U-20 Japan. He&#x27;s taken off from the team because of his incapability to shoot with both legs after losing to Real Japan 7, but returns to the team.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalised version of Henry Troyat is featured in the 2014–2015 Image Comics Millarworld comic book series &quot;MPH&quot; by Mark Millar and Duncan Fegredo as the former Chief Scientific Officer of France&#x27;s superhuman development program and inventor of the titular &quot;MPH&quot; super-speed pill, who disappeared in 1984 and has been living in-hiding ever since (bar attending the occasional jazz festival). While Millar revealed in an interview in January 2014 that the character would return in another then-untitled title set in the Millarworld shared fictional universe the following year, which turned out to be &quot;&quot;, the character would be renamed &quot;Orlov&quot; for this follow-up appearance.

<doc id="944396" wikidata="Q494940" url="?curid=944396" title="Kings Highway (Australia)">
<text>Kings Highway is an interstate highway located within the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, Australia. The highway connects Canberra with Batemans Bay on the South Coast. It is designated route B52. 

==Route==
West to east, it starts at the interchange with Monaro Highway, Canberra Avenue and Ipswich Street on the northern border of Symonston in the Australian Capital Territory and continues in an easterly direction along Canberra Avenue, crosses over the border into New South Wales near Queanbeyan, passes through Queanbeyan itself, Carwoola, briefly crosses back into the Kowen district of ACT and then back into NSW heading south-east to Batemans Bay via Bungendore, Braidwood and Nelligen.

Kings Highway links Monaro Highway in Canberra to Princes Highway in Batemans Bay, and provides access for residents of Canberra to the NSW South Coast and its beaches. The highway is often busy on weekends, especially during summer. The highway also experiences a high number of car crashes, on occasions averaging around one every three days, costing the local community around the highway several million dollars a year.

The landscape is generally sheep country. The highway travels from the Southern Tablelands to the South Coast via Clyde Mountain.

=== Notable features and landmarks ===
A small rock cave at &quot;Pooh Bear&#x27;s Corner&quot; can be found near the top of the Clyde Mountain Pass. This was the location of a munitions store during the Second World War, that could be detonated to stop passage from the coast to the national capital inland.

Dozens of soft toys are placed in the eucalyptus trees along the stretch of road that connects Queanbeyan and Bungendore.

==History==
The road through the Clyde Mountain area was surveyed by Thomas Mitchell in 1855.

A punt service across the Clyde River opened in 1895 and continued until the Nelligen Bridge opened on 12 December 1964. A replacement bridge built by Seymour Whyte opened in February 2023 with the original demolished.

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 51 was declared along this road on 8 August 1928, from the intersection with Princes Highway at Batemans Bay, via Braidwood, Bungendore, and Queanbeyan to the border with the Federal Capital Territory (today the Australian Capital Territory); with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Trunk Road 51 on 8 April 1929.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the highway today retains its declaration as Main Road 51, from the state border with Australian Capital Territory west of Queanbeyan to the intersection with Princes Highway in Batemans Bay. Despite its long-standing classification as a Main Road, and a long historical identity as Kings Highway, the road still has no officially gazetted name. Transport for NSW has come to an informal agreement with councils along the route to signpost the entire route as Kings Highway.

Kings Highway was signed National Route 52 across its entire length in 1974. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in both states in 2013, this was replaced with route B52.

In 2006 construction commenced on Headquarters Joint Operations Command in the Kowen district of the ACT between Bungendore and Queanbeyan. The facility opened in December 2008, and sections of the highway between the HQJOC turnoff and Queanbeyan have progressively been upgraded to cater for the increased traffic.

== Road usage ==
In 2013 it was reported that the highway carries an average of 4,500 vehicles a day. There is an increase in traffic in the summer months. In 2003, approximately 3,000 vehicles a day were using the highway at Nelligen. From Braidwood (at the Shoalhaven River Bridge) there were about 4,200 cars travelling on the road. Out of Bungendore near Burbong, 5,600 cars were counted each day.

Casualty crash rates on the Kings Highway are 85% higher than the NSW average and road fatalities are 8% higher. A 2005 NRMA road survey found:
* The rate of people hospitalised after crashes on the Kings Highway is well over the national average. 877 crashes were recorded on Kings Highway over a 10-year period, an average of about one crash every four days. Over this time there have been 24 fatal crashes, 355 crashes resulting in injury and 488 crashes resulting in property damage. The rate was worse than this in 2004, when there were 103 crashes resulting in six fatalities and 53 injuries.
* Crashes on the Kings Highway have cost A$42.65 million over the past three years – that&#x27;s equivalent to nearly A$39,000 every day.
* Safety: particular concerns over Clyde Mountain, and only 5% of road deemed to provide &quot;safe&quot; overtaking opportunities. Two blackspots (one in Eurobodalla and one in Palerang) and 16 blacklengths (nine in Eurobodalla, six in Palerang and one in Queanbeyan City) were identified. The section of road over the Great Dividing Range – which includes Clyde Mountain – recorded the highest number of crashes, with 22% of all incidents occurring in this area.
* The most common type of crash – 18% of all incidents – was when a vehicle leaves the road to the left on a right hand bend and crashes into a stationary object. Head-on collisions made up one in 10 of all crashes. Crashes occurred most frequently on Sundays (20%) and least frequently on Tuesdays (9%). Recent drought conditions and an explosion in the kangaroo population in the area, has seen a marked increase in the number of crashes between vehicles and these macropods – particularly at night. This is evidenced by the increasing levels of &#x27;road kill&#x27; carcasses on the sides of the Highway.

<doc id="944401" wikidata="Q3258942" url="?curid=944401" title="London Chronicle">
<text>The London Chronicle was an early family newspaper of Georgian London. It was a thrice-a-week evening paper, introduced in 1756, and contained world and national news, and coverage of artistic, literary, and theatrical events in the capital.

A typical issue was eight pages, quarto size. Many of the stories were copied from government reports published in the official &quot;London Gazette&quot;. Copying from other newspapers was rife, and many reports were in the form of letters from so-called gentlemen.

Originally titled The London Chronicle: or, Universal Evening Post it first ran from 1757 to June 1765. It was continued by The London Chronicle which appeared in 113 volumes from 2 July 1765 to 23 April 1823. It was then absorbed by the &quot;Commercial chronicle&quot; and continued in its original title (&quot;London chronicle: or, Universal evening post&quot;). In 1823 it was absorbed into the London Packet.

This newspaper was one of the first to break the news that the United States had declared independence from the British Empire, reporting on the event in its 13 August 1776 edition. It was also one of the first to publish the declaration in its entirety, in the 15–17 August 1776 edition, but containing no explanation or comment as to what it was.

<text>Hugh Halkett, GCH, CB, (30 August 1783 – 10 December 1863) was a Scottish army officer who served in the British and Hanoverian armies and fought in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

== Early career ==

Halkett was born in Musselburgh, Scotland. He was second son of Major-General F. G. Halkett and brother of Lieutenant General Colin Halkett.

From 1798 to 1801, Halkett served in India in the British Army&#x27;s Scotch Brigade, which his father had been instrumental in raising. In 1803 as senior captain, he joined the 2nd Light Infantry Battalion of the newly formed King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL), which was under the command of his brother Colin. The 2nd Light were involved in the Cathcart&#x27;s expeditions to Hanover, Rügen and Copenhagen. During this time he was promoted to major and his bold initiative on outpost duty won a commendation.

From 1808 until 1813 Halkett fought in the Peninsular War, except in 1809 when he took part in the Walcheren Expedition. He fought at the Battle of Albuera in Charles Alten&#x27;s independent KGL brigade. When his brother was promoted to lead the brigade, Halkett took over command of the 2nd Light Infantry Battalion, KGL. At the Battle of Salamanca, his battalion fought in John Hope&#x27;s 7th Division. In the Siege of Burgos campaign, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Venta del Pozo. In 1813 he joined the newly reformed Hanoverian Army. At the Battle of the Göhrde he led a brigade of Hanoverian troops under Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn. He captured a Danish standard at the Battle of Sehested.

== Waterloo and later career ==

At the Battle of Waterloo, Halkett commanded four battalions of Hanoverian &quot;landwehr&quot; which were sent to the front with the regulars. These units were organised into the 3rd Hanoverian Brigade of Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton&#x27;s 2nd Division. Halkett&#x27;s brigade was held in reserve on the right flank for most of the battle. After the defeat of Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard, the Duke of Wellington sent Halkett to pursue the disintegrating French forces. He is remembered for capturing General Pierre Cambronne while his Osnabrück Battalion engaged the French Imperial Guard.

After Waterloo, Halkett stayed in the Hanoverian service. He rose to be a general and inspector-general of infantry. He led a Federal Army Corps in the First War of Schleswig (also known as the Prussian-Danish War of 1848), and defeated the Danes at the Skirmish of Oversø, a rear-guard action at Sankelmark.

Halkett held many foreign orders, including the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle, the Pour le Mérite and the Russian Order of St. Anna. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1815 and promoted to Knight Grand Cross in 1851. In 1862, he was ennobled (heritable) to a Freiherr (Baron) by King George V of Hanover.

==Family==
Halkett married Emilia Charlotte, daughter of Sir James Lamb, 1st Baronet on 25 May 1810.

<text>The Grove Family is a British television series soap opera, generally regarded as the first of its kind broadcast in the UK, made and broadcast by the BBC Television Service from 1954 to 1957. The series concerned the life of the family of the title, who were named after the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove Studios, where the programme was made.

The programme was written by Roland and Michael Pertwee, respectively, the father and elder brother of actor Jon Pertwee. As was common for British television at the time, the series was broadcast live, and very few episodes survive in the archives: only three of the original 148 episodes. One of the few surviving shows was transmitted on BBC Four during 2004. A film version produced during 1955 by the Butchers company, written by the Pertwees and featuring the television cast, exists as an example of the series. The film was entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Day&quot; and shown on the Talking Pictures TV channel in July 2017. During 1954, &quot;The Grove Family&quot; was viewed by almost a quarter of British people with a television. The show was reportedly brought to an end when, after three years&#x27; writing, the Pertwees&#x27; request for a break was refused by the BBC, with the Corporation preferring to cancel the popular series altogether.

Peter Bryant, who featured as Jack Grove, later became a script editor and producer of the BBC science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Christopher Beeny, who played the teenage Lennie Grove, later featured in the series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; (1971–75), and actress Ruth Dunning (Gladys Grove) later won a BAFTA award for her work on &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;.

In 1991, during a special day of programming on BBC2 to commemorate the closing of Lime Grove, a new edition of the programme was shown, a modern production of one of the original scripts with the roles filled by popular television soap opera actors of the time, including Leslie Grantham, Anna Wing, Sue Johnston, Nick Berry, Sally Ann Matthews, Paul Parris and Kellie Bright.

==Plot==

The lower middle-class Grove family live in the London suburb of Hendon. Patriarch Bob Grove is a builder, allowing the show to demonstrate basic home security. He lives with his mother, his wife, and their four children. The first episode shows the family making their last mortgage payment, and over the course of the series Bob tries to grow his business and attain prosperity in postwar Britain. The fourth episode shows Gran buying the family a television set, a sign of the new consumerism. Gran Groves&#x27; demand &quot;I want me tea&quot; became a catchphrase.

==Theme tune==
The theme tune, named &quot;Family Joke&quot; and featuring harmonica played by Tommy Reilly, was composed by Eric Spear, who went on to become better known as the composer of the theme tune to the long-running soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

==Principal cast==

* Ruth Dunning as Gladys Grove
* Peter Bryant as Jack Grove
* Christopher Beeny as Lennie Grove
* Nancy Roberts as Gran
* Margaret Downs as Daphne Grove

<text>Martin Howard Willson-Piper (born 7 May 1958) known as Marty Willson-Piper is an English guitarist and singer-songwriter famous for his work as a former long-time member of the Australian ARIA Hall of Fame inductees, psychedelic rock band The Church. He joined in 1980 after seeing an early gig where they were performing as a three-piece. He was an integral member of the band for 33 years. He was also the guitarist for the English alternative rock band All About Eve from 1991 to 1993 and again from 1999 to 2002. He has also worked with Swedish progressive rock band Anekdoten and has collaborated with Linda Perry, Jules Shear, Tom Verlaine, Charlie Sexton, Aimee Mann, Brix Smith, and Rob Dickinson amongst others.

==Early life==
Willson-Piper was born in Stockport, Cheshire, on 7 May 1958 and grew up as a teenager in Thingwall. He has a brother and an adopted sister. When he was three years old the family moved from Compstall where his parents had a pub called The Commercial. Around 1970, the family moved to Birch Vale in Derbyshire, a small village between New Mills and Hayfield, where his parents took on another pub. They later moved to Thingwall.

At 14 he was taught the guitar by his brother, who was a member of a cabaret band. Willson-Piper soon started his own band with school friends. After leaving school at 16, Willson-Piper worked various jobs. He soon travelled to mainland Europe busking outside train stations and working odd jobs such as grape collecting.

He moved to Australia in April 1980. Willson-Piper went along to see an early performance of The Church and was asked to join the band a few days before his 22nd birthday in May 1980.

==The Church==
On 6 May 1980, Willson-Piper joined The Church on guitar, vocals and bass guitar, alongside Steve Kilbey, Peter Koppes and Nick Ward. Willson-Piper&#x27;s sound was influenced by guitarists such as Tom Verlaine and Bill Nelson.

Willson-Piper contributed to most of the Church&#x27;s studio releases and was a member almost continuously from 1980 to 2013. The only exception is the 1997 album &quot;Pharmakoi/Distance-Crunching Honchos with Echo Units&quot;, which only featured Kilbey, Koppes and drummer Tim Powles and was released as by &quot;The Refo:mation&quot;.

In 2013, Kilbey announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that former Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug had replaced Willson-Piper.

==Solo career and Noctorum==
Willson-Piper has maintained a steady solo output since the mid-1980s, releasing six solo studio albums and three live solo albums.

Four of his albums are collaborations with long-time friend Dare Mason (who has produced and played on Willson-Piper&#x27;s solo releases) under the name Noctorum.

In September 2015, Willson-Piper&#x27;s band Acres Of Space embarked on a tour of the United States. During the spring and summer of 2016, Acres of Space toured the Eastern half of the United States. In December 2016 / January 2017 Acres Of Space played four shows in Chile.

==In Deep Music Archive==
Willson-Piper is an avid record collector. His music archive, the In Deep Music Archive (named after Argent&#x27;s 1973 album In Deep), is an eclectic collection of music in many forms. An historical and contemporary library of various physical formats: vinyl, CD, cassette, reel to reel tape, 8 track, 78 rpm, VHS, DVD, Laser discs, reference books, encyclopedias, catalogues, biographies and magazines. The archive&#x27;s digital presence is the In Deep Music Archive website with regular posts about both popular and more obscure artists included in the collection. Collected by Willson-Piper over the past 50 years, the archive has grown into a collection through a life of scouring the record stores around the world, but also through donations from friends, fans and record labels. It currently holds an estimated 50,000 vinyl records and is located in Porto, Portugal.

<text>The Commish is an American comedy-drama television series that aired on ABC in the United States from September 28, 1991, to January 11, 1996. The series focuses on the work and home life of a suburban police commissioner in fictional Eastbridge, New York. The show was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia.

==Premise==
The series stars Michael Chiklis as Anthony Joseph &quot;Tony&quot; Scali, a former NYPD detective who is now the police commissioner in the small fictional suburban New York town of Eastbridge, and tends to work through problems with humor and creativity more often than with violence or force. Theresa Saldana plays Rachel Scali (née Metzger), Tony&#x27;s wife, and Kaj-Erik Eriksen plays their young son, David. Also living with the family in the first season was Rachel&#x27;s freeloading brother, Arnie Metzger, played by David Paymer. A daughter, Sarah Lou, named after her maternal grandmother Sarah Metzger (Rachel&#x27;s mother) and Lou Donello (an old friend and former partner of Tony&#x27;s), and played by twins Justine and Dayna Cornborough, was born to Tony and Rachel in the eighth episode of the second season, &quot;A Time to Be Born&quot;. 

Focusing both on family situations and police drama, the series deals with a wide range of topical social issues such as police corruption, racism, homophobia, drug addiction, disabilities, child abuse, illegal immigration, and sexual harassment.

==Episodes==

==Cast==
In addition to Commissioner Scali&#x27;s family, the cast included police working under his command. 

Scali had three different lieutenants at his precinct during the show&#x27;s run; Lt. Irving &quot;Irv&quot; Wallerstein (Alex Bruhanski), his longtime buddy and second-in-command, was killed in the line of duty in the eleventh episode of Season 1, &quot;The Fourth Man&quot;, after appearing in only a few episodes and was replaced by Lt. Paul &quot;Paulie&quot; Pentangeli (John Cygan), his childhood best friend. At the start of the second season, Pentangeli shot an unarmed suspect who was reaching for a cigarette case.

Although Pentangeli was acquitted, Scali nonetheless fired him, suspecting that Pentangeli knowingly shot the suspect on whom they had insufficient evidence to prosecute. Pentangeli had said that it felt like real police work. He was replaced by a female lieutenant, elegant former FBI agent Cydavia &quot;Cyd&quot; Madison (Melinda McGraw), who continued through to the end of season three before leaving the Eastbridge department to work as a commissioner in another city at the start of season four, when jean-wearing Pentangeli returned to the series despite his continuing disagreement with Scali regarding the nature of the shooting in season two.

The star cops who also worked closely with Scali included Stanley Oliver &quot;Stan&quot; Kelly (Geoffrey Nauffts), Carmela Theresa Antonia Pagan (Gina Belafonte), and hot-headed Richard &quot;Ricky&quot; Caruso (Nicholas Lea). Series regular Kelly was killed off at the end of season three, whereas other characters such as Pagan would simply disappear for longer stretches inexplicably.

==Production==

Chiklis&#x27; character, Tony Scali, was at least ten years older than Chiklis&#x27; age at the time. At one point, the network, worried that Chiklis&#x27; weight loss would affect the ratings, reportedly asked him to stuff his clothing. He also was encouraged not to shave his head to look older.

Although set in the fictional town of Eastbridge in the Hudson Valley, New York, the show was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The character Tony Scali was based on the real-life 30th Commissioner of New York City&#x27;s Department of Correction, Anthony Schembri, the son of an Italian immigrant, who grew up in Brooklyn. Schembri recalls incidents such as his deflecting a man intent on suicide from wanting to jumping off of a roof: “I asked him if he had a permit to jump off.” This means of diversion, used in the series premiere, characterizes Scali’s modus operandi. Schembri later served as the Secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice under Governor Jeb Bush, as the Citrus County, Florida, County Administrator, and later still as an advisor to India’s Centre for Criminology and Public Policy Committee.

Schembri was &quot;discovered&quot; after being a technical consultant for the TV series (while serving as the Police Commissioner of Rye, New York). The show was unrealistic in that Tony Scali the police commissioner, working as Schembri had done while he was a Brooklyn detective, would do many things a real-life police commissioner doesn&#x27;t (such as personally chase criminals and investigate crimes).

Though the series was originally slated to air on CBS, unresolved casting differences led Stephen J. Cannell to cease pre-production with that network. Eventually, Cannell took the series to ABC and it won the ratings war with CBS for that time slot (Saturday nights at 10pm).

Actor Jason Alexander said he had been offered a role on the show, but turned it down as the TV show he was already cast in — &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, where he played George Costanza — got picked up for another season and went on to become one of the most successful sitcoms in history.

==Home media==
Anchor Bay Entertainment released the first two seasons of &quot;The Commish&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in 2004–2005. Because of poor sales, these releases were discontinued and no further seasons were made available.

In 2009, Mill Creek Entertainment acquired the rights to several Stephen J. Cannell series, including &quot;The Commish&quot;. They subsequently re-released the first two seasons.

On October 12, 2010, Mill Creek released &quot;The Commish: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 17-disc set features all 94 episodes of the series on DVD for the first time.

In August 2022, Visual Entertainment released &quot;The Commish: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In Region 4, Beyond Home Entertainment has released the first four seasons on DVD in Australia.

==Awards==
Theresa Saldana received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in 1994.

<text>Tonto is a fictional character; he is the Native American (either Tonto Apache, Comanche, or Potawatomi) companion of the Lone Ranger, a popular American Western character created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker. Tonto has appeared in radio and television series and other presentations of the characters&#x27; adventures righting wrongs in 19th-century western United States.

Tonto made his first appearance on the 11th episode of the radio show, which originated on the Detroit, Michigan, radio station WXYZ. Though he became well known as the Lone Ranger&#x27;s friend, Tonto was originally created just so the Lone Ranger would have someone to talk to. Throughout the radio run (which spanned 21 years), with only a few exceptions, Tonto was played by American actor John Todd.

Chief Thundercloud played the character in the Republic movie serials &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;The Lone Ranger Rides Again&quot;. To this point, Tonto had been depicted, on the radio series, as a somewhat elderly sidekick. This serial established the better-remembered image of Tonto as a handsome young tribal warrior in buckskins. The only diversion from this image since then has been Johnny Depp&#x27;s depiction in Disney&#x27;s 2013 film, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, the most recent portrayal.

Jay Silverheels portrayed the arguably best-remembered version in &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; television series. This was the highest-rated television program on the ABC network in the early 1950s and its first true &quot;hit&quot;.

Ivan Naranjo, a Blackfoot/Southern Ute actor from Colorado, voiced the character in &quot;The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour&quot;.

Michael Horse portrayed Tonto in the film &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot; (1981).

==Character==
Tonto made his first appearance on the 11th episode of the radio show &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. Two conflicting origin stories have been given for the character Tonto and how he came to work with the Lone Ranger. As originally presented, in the December 7, 1938, radio broadcast, Reid had already been well established as the Lone Ranger when he met Tonto. In that episode Cactus Pete, a friend of the Lone Ranger&#x27;s, tells the story of how the masked man and Tonto first met. According to that tale, Tonto had been caught in the explosion when two men dynamited a gold mine they were working. One of the men wanted to kill the wounded Tonto, but the Lone Ranger arrived on the scene and made him administer first aid. The miner subsequently decided to keep Tonto around, intending to make him the fall guy when he would later murder his partner. The Lone Ranger foiled both the attempted murder and the framing. No reason was given in the episode as to why Tonto chose to travel with the Lone Ranger, rather than continue about his business.

A different version was given in later episodes of the radio drama and at the beginning of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; television series: Tonto rescues the sole surviving Texas Ranger of a party that was tricked into an ambush by the outlaw Butch Cavendish. Tonto recognizes the ranger as someone who had saved him when they were both boys. He refers to him by the title &quot;ke-mo sah-bee&quot;, explaining that the phrase means &quot;faithful friend&quot; (radio series) or &quot;trusty scout&quot; (television series) in the language of his tribe. In the 2013 film, Tonto translates the word as meaning &quot;wrong brother&quot;. Tonto buries the dead rangers, and the Lone Ranger instructs him to make a sixth empty grave to leave the impression that he, too, is dead.

The radio series identified Tonto as a chief&#x27;s son in the Potawatomi nation. The Potawatomi originated in the Great Lakes region, but in the 19th century, most had been relocated to the midwestern states. The choice to make Tonto a Potawatomi seems to come from station owner George Trendle&#x27;s youth in Mullett Lake, Michigan. Located in the northern part of the Midwest, Michigan is the traditional territory of the Potawatomi, and many local institutions use Potawatomi names. Trendle gained the name &quot;Tonto&quot; from the local Potawatomi, who told him it meant &quot;wild one&quot; in their language. Other sources indicate that Camp Kee Mo Sah Bee belonged to the father-in-law of the show&#x27;s director, James Jewell. According to author David Rothel, who interviewed Jewell a few months before his death, &quot;Kee Mo Sah Bee&quot; and &quot;Tonto&quot; were the only two words that Jewell remembered from those days. Alternatively, Tonto&#x27;s name may have been inspired by the name of Tonto Basin, Arizona. In the first novel in a series published by Grosset and Dunlap, Tonto is described as a &quot;half-breed.&quot; Though credited to Fran Striker, this book was actually written by Gaylord du Bois. Later books in the series were actually written by Striker, and were in line with the continuity from the radio series.

In the 2013 theatrical feature film of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, Tonto is depicted as a disgraced Comanche tribesman and the last of the wendigo hunters. It&#x27;s revealed that Tonto is actually suffering severe mental illness and survivor&#x27;s guilt for inadvertently causing the massacre of his tribe by the film&#x27;s villains. To rationalize what he had done, he convinced himself that the cannibalistic Butch Cavendish was a wendigo, a non-existent monster used in Native American ghost stories to frighten children. The character wears black-and-white face paint and a deceased crow on his head. According to Johnny Depp, who played him, the inspiration for the costume was a painting entitled &quot;I Am Crow&quot; by Kirby Sattler.

In Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, &quot;tonto&quot; translates as &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;moron&quot;, or &quot;fool&quot;. In the Italian version the original name is retained, but in the Spanish dubbed version, the character is called &quot;Toro&quot; (Spanish for &quot;bull&quot;) or &quot;Ponto&quot;.

==Tonto&#x27;s horse==
Tonto first rode a horse named &quot;White Feller&quot; (White Fella/Fellah). When the 1938 Republic movie serial &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; was being filmed, it was thought that having two white horses would be confusing, so the producers made &quot;White Feller&quot; a pinto horse, presumably on the theory that, being partly white, a pinto could still be named &quot;White Feller&quot;. The radio series, noting that the pinto in the film had gone over well with audiences, decided that Tonto&#x27;s mount would henceforth be a pinto. For several episodes, Tonto&#x27;s new horse went unnamed, referred to only as &quot;the paint horse&quot; or simply &quot;Paint&quot;. Eventually the name &quot;Scout&quot; was adopted.

==Comics==
Tonto starred in his own comic book, &quot;The Lone Ranger&#x27;s Companion Tonto&quot;, 31 issues of which were published by Dell Comics during the 1950s.

Later depictions beginning in the 1980s have taken efforts to show Tonto as an articulate and proud warrior whom the Ranger treats as an equal partner. In the Topps Comics four-issue miniseries, &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto&quot;, Tonto is even shown to be a very witty, outspoken, and sarcastic character willing to punch the Lone Ranger during a heated argument and commenting on his past pop-culture depictions with the words, &quot;Of course, Kemosabe. Maybe when we talk I should use that &#x27;me Tonto&#x27; stuff, way they write about me in the dime novels. You&#x27;d like that, wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot;

==Television==
In the &quot;Timeless&quot; episode &quot;Murder of Jesse James&quot;, Wyatt Logan, one of the main characters, mentions that Native American deputy U.S. marshal Grant Johnson was the inspiration for Tonto.

Jon Lovitz played a comic version of Tonto, in a group of other characters who speak little or broken English, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Reception==
The portrayal of Tonto has been seen by some Native Americans and others as degrading, notably by Native American author and poet Sherman Alexie. 

Tonto was originally depicted as not fluent in English and spoke in a pidgin, saying things like, &quot;That right, Kemo Sabe&quot;, or &quot;Him say man ride over ridge on horse&quot;.

In 1975, poet and science fiction writer Paul O. Williams coined the term &quot;tontoism&quot; to refer to the practice of writing haiku with missing articles (&quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, or &quot;an&quot;), which he claimed made such haiku sound like Tonto&#x27;s stunted English.

Michael Horse who played Tonto in the 1981 Lone Ranger film had mixed feelings about the role, and worried it was perpetuating stereotypes.
Later adaptations of the character, such as &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot; and the Filmation animated series, depict him as being articulate in English and speaking it carefully.

Silverheels was not above making a little fun of the character, as in a classic sketch on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; with Carson playing a career counselor and Silverheels playing Tonto looking for a new job after working &quot;thirty lousy years&quot; as the Lone Ranger&#x27;s faithful sidekick. When asked why he was looking for a new job, Tonto replies, &quot;Him finally find out what Kemo Sabe means!&quot;

<text>The Heights of Abraham is a tourist attraction in Matlock Bath, Derbyshire, England. It consists of a hilltop park on top of Masson Hill, accessed from the village by the Heights of Abraham cable car. The heights are named after a supposed resemblance to the Plains of Abraham, also known as the Heights of Abraham, in Quebec, Canada, where General James Wolfe died in battle against the French in 1759.

Amongst the attractions in the park, which has been open since Victorian times, are cavern and mine tours. There are also views of the dramatic scenery of the valley of the River Derwent. The cable car was opened in 1984 to provide easier access.

The Heights of Abraham are listed as grade II* in the register of historic parks and gardens of special historic interest in England.

== Attractions ==

There are two caves at the Heights of Abraham, the Great Masson Cavern and the Great Rutland Cavern, both previously mined for lead ore and fluorspar. It is thought that lead mining in this area began in Roman times and reached its peak in the 1700s. As deposits began to dwindle, and cheaper lead was imported in the 1800s, the miners found a far more lucrative use for the caves as tourist attractions; in the process of excavation a large network of caverns and passageways were created which wealthy visitors would now pay to see. There are regular guided tours to retrace the miners&#x27; footsteps with a nearby exhibition of photography, fossils and an information film, explaining the cave&#x27;s history.

The Victoria Prospect Tower was built in 1844 to celebrate the reign of Queen Victoria. From the top of the tower, and from the adjacent amphitheatre, there are panoramic views of the valley of the River Derwent, the spa town of Matlock Bath and the nearby Riber Castle, a ruinous Victorian grand house, and Willersley Castle, a castellated mansion that is now an outdoors pursuit centre. A more modern viewing platform is Tinker&#x27;s Shaft, which provides valley views as well as a vertical view into the Great Masson Cavern. A view from a different perspective can be obtained from the cable car, as it ascends and descends across the valley to a terminal on the far bank of the river.

The site is home to the Vista restaurant/bar, the terrace café and an ice-cream parlour. There is also a shop specialising in the sale of rock- and mineral-themed items.

== Access ==

Access to the Heights of Abraham is by the cable car only. The lower station of the cable car is located on the opposite bank of the River Derwent to the Heights of Abraham and the town of Matlock Bath, with the cabins crossing the river at the lower end of their journey. A footbridge provides access from the town to the lower station, which is also a short walk away from Matlock Bath railway station.

The site is privately run, and an admission charge is applied. The admission charge covers admission to all the attractions and cave tours. The site is open every day from February to early November, and on various other days. Opening times are 10:00 to 16.30, and later during holidays.

<text>Nymphaea () is a genus of hardy and tender aquatic plants in the family Nymphaeaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution. Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants, and many cultivars have been bred. Some taxa occur as introduced species where they are not native, and some are weeds. Plants of the genus are known commonly as water lilies, or waterlilies in the United Kingdom. The genus name is from the Greek νυμφαία, &quot;nymphaia&quot; and the Latin &quot;nymphaea&quot;, which means &quot;water lily&quot; and were inspired by the nymphs of Greek and Latin mythology.

==Description==




===Vegetative characteristics===
Water lilies are aquatic, rhizomatous or tuberous, perennial or annual herbs with sometimes desiccation-tolerant, branched or unbranched rhizomes, which can be stoloniferous, or lacking stolons. The tuberous or fibrous roots are contractile. The leaves are mostly floating, but submerged and emergent leaves occur as well. The shape of the lamina can be ovate, orbicular, elliptic, hastate, or sagittate. The width of the lamina ranges in size from 2.5–3 cm to 40–60 cm. The lamina has a deep sinus and the basal lobes can be overlapping or divergent. The margin of the lamina can be entire, dentate, or sinuate. The leaves can be stipulate, or exstipulate. The petioles are a few centimetres to 5–6 m long, and 0.3–1.9 cm wide.

===Generative characteristics===
The flowers are emergent, floating, or rarely submerged. The diurnal or nocturnal, chasmogamous or rarely cleistogamous, solitary, hermaphrodite, entomophilous, fragrant or inodorous flowers are mostly protogynous. The flowers have (3–)4(–5) green, sometimes spotted sepals, and about 6–50 lanceolate to spathulate, differently coloured petals, which are often gradually transitioning into the shape of the stamens. The gap between petals and stamens can be present or absent. The androecium consists of 20–750 stamens. The stamens can be petaloid or not petal-like. The gynoecium consists of 5–35 carpels. The carpels usually posess a sterile appendage. The globose, fleshy, spongy, irregularly dehiscent fruit, borne on a terete, glabrous or pubescent, curved or coiled peduncle, bears arillate, globose to elliptic, hairy or glabrous seeds with a smooth surface or longitudinal ridges. Proliferating pseudanthia or tuberous flowers (i.e., sterile, branching, proliferating floral structures for vegetative propagation) can be present or absent.

==Cytology==
Various ploidy levels have been observed in &quot;Nymphaea&quot;: 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, 8x, and 16x. The chromosome count ranges from 28 to 224.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Nymphaea&quot; L. was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It has three synonyms: &quot;Castalia&quot; Salisb. published by Richard Anthony Salisbury in 1805, &quot;Leuconymphaea&quot; Kuntze published by Otto Kuntze in 1891, and &quot;Ondinea&quot; Hartog published by Cornelis den Hartog in 1970. The type species is &quot;Nymphaea alba&quot; L.

=== Subgenera ===
The genus &quot;Nymphaea&quot; has been divided into several subgenera:

*†&quot;Nymphaea haeringiana&quot; 

===Evolutionary relationships===
The genus &quot;Nymphaea&quot; may be paraphyletic in its current circumscription, as the genera &quot;Euryale&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot; have been placed within the genus &quot;Nymphaea&quot; in several studies.

==Ecology==
===Habitat===
&quot;Nymphaea&quot; occurs in freshwater, as well as brackish water habitats.

===Pollination===
Flowers of &quot;Nymphaea&quot; subg. &quot;Hydrocallis&quot; are pollinated by &quot;Cyclocephala&quot; beetles. Likewise, beetle pollination by &quot;Ruteloryctes morio&quot;, a member of the same Cyclocephalini tribe, has been reported in &quot;Nymphaea&quot; subg. &quot;Lotos&quot;. The subgenera &quot;Nymphaea&quot; subg. &quot;Anecphya&quot; and &quot;Nymphaea&quot; subg. &quot;Brachyceras&quot; are pollinated by bees and flies. The subgenus &quot;Nymphaea&quot; subg. &quot;Nymphaea&quot; is pollinated by bees, flies and beetles.

===Herbivory===
Many birds feed on seeds and fruits of &quot;Nymphaea&quot;.

===Invasive species===
Outside of its natural habitat, &quot;Nymphaea mexicana&quot; and hybrids thereof have become invasive weeds. It has been proposed to employ the weevil species &quot;Bagous longulus&quot; as a biocontrol agent against &quot;Nymphaea mexicana&quot; in South Africa. Invasive horticultural hybrids can pose a threat to &quot;Nymphaea&quot; species through introgressive hybridisation. The naturalised hybrids can displace native species and mask their disappearance, as it can be difficult to distinguish between species and naturalised hybrids.

==Conservation==
Several species are in danger of extinction. &quot;Nymphaea thermarum&quot; is classified as critically endangered (CR), &quot;Nymphaea loriana&quot; is classified as endangered (EN), &quot;Nymphaea stuhlmannii&quot; is classified as endangered (EN), and &quot;Nymphaea nouchali&quot; var. &quot;mutandaensis&quot; is also classified as endangered (EN).

==Use==
=== Horticulture ===
Water lilies are not only decorative, but also provide useful shade which helps reduce the growth of algae in ponds and lakes. Many of the water lilies familiar in water gardening are hybrids and cultivars. These cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* &#x27;Escarboucle&#x27; (orange-red)
* &#x27;Gladstoniana&#x27; (double white flowers with prominent yellow stamens)
* &#x27;Gonnère&#x27; (double white scented flowers)
* &#x27;James Brydon;&#x27; (cupped rose-red flowers)
* &#x27;Marliacea Chromatella&#x27; (pale yellow flowers)
* &#x27;Pygmaea Helvola&#x27; (miniature, with cupped fragrant yellow flowers)

===Food===

All water lilies are poisonous and contain an alkaloid called nupharin in almost all of their parts.

In India, it has mostly been eaten as a famine food or as a medicinal (both cooked).

In Sri Lanka it was formerly eaten as a type of medicine and its price was too high to serve as a normal meal, but in the 1940s or earlier some villagers began to grow water lilies in the paddy fields left uncultivated during the monsoon season (Yala season), and the price dropped. The tubers are called &quot;manel&quot; here and eaten boiled and in curries.

In West Africa, usage varied between cultures, in the Upper Guinea the rhizomes were only considered famine foods - here the tubers were either roasted in ashes, or dried and ground into a flour. The Buduma people ate the seeds and rhizomes. Some tribes ate the rhizomes raw. 
The Hausa people of Ghana, Nigeria and the people of Southern Sudan used the tubers of &quot;Nymphaea lotus&quot;, the seeds (inside the tubers) are locally referred to as &#x27;gunsi&#x27; in Ghana. They are ground into flour.

The plants were also said to be eaten in the Philippines. In the 1950s there were no records of leaves or flowers being eaten.

In a North American species, the boiled young leaves and unopened flower buds are said to be edible. The seeds, high in starch, protein, and oil, may be popped, parched, or ground into flour. Potato-like tubers can be collected from the species &quot;N. tuberosa&quot; (=&quot;N. odorata&quot;).

Water lilies were said to have been a major food source for a certain tribe of indigenous Australians in 1930, with the flowers and stems eaten raw, while the &quot;roots and seedpods&quot; were cooked either on an open fire or in a ground oven.

===Other uses===
Tannins extracted from rhizomes are used in dyeing wool a purple-black or brown colour. The peduncles are used as pipes to smoke tobacco.

==Culture==

The Ancient Egyptians used the water lilies of the Nile as cultural symbols. Since 1580 it has become popular in the English language to apply the Latin word &quot;lotus&quot;, originally used to designate a tree, to the water lilies growing in Egypt, and much later the word was used to translate words in Indian texts. The lotus motif is a frequent feature of temple column architecture.
In Egypt, the lotus, rising from the bottom mud to unfold its petals to the sun, suggested the glory of the sun&#x27;s own emergence from the primaeval slime. It was a metaphor of creation. It was a symbol of the fertility gods and goddesses as well as a symbol of the upper Nile as the giver of life.

A Roman belief existed that drinking a liquid of crushed &quot;Nymphaea&quot; in vinegar for 10 consecutive days turned a boy into a eunuch.

A Syrian terra-cotta plaque from the 14th–13th centuries BC shows the goddess Asherah holding two lotus blossoms. An ivory panel from the 9th-8th centuries BC shows the god Horus seated on a lotus blossom, flanked by two cherubs.

The French Impressionist painter Claude Monet is known for his many paintings of water lilies in the pond in his garden at Giverny.

&quot;N. nouchali&quot; is the national flower of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Water lilies are also used as ritual narcotics. According to one source, this topic &quot;was the subject of a lecture by William Emboden given at Nash Hall of the Harvard Botanical Museum on the morning of April 6, 1979&quot;.

<text>Andre Jules Dubus II (August 11, 1936 – February 24, 1999) was an American writer of short stories, novels, and essays.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Andre Jules Dubus II was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the youngest child of Katherine (Burke) and André Jules Dubus, a Cajun-Irish Catholic family. His two elder siblings are Kathryn and Beth. James Lee Burke is his first cousin. His surname is pronounced &quot;Duh-BYOOSE&quot;, with the accent falling on the second syllable, as in &quot;profuse&quot;. Dubus grew up in the Bayou country in Lafayette, Louisiana, and was educated by the Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious order that emphasized literature and writing. Dubus graduated from nearby McNeese State College in 1958 as a journalism and English major. Dubus then spent six years in the Marine Corps, eventually rising to the rank of captain. At this time he married his first wife and started a family. After leaving the Marine Corps, Dubus moved with his wife and four children to Iowa City, where he later graduated from the University of Iowa&#x27;s Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop with an MFA in creative writing, studying under Richard Yates. The family then moved to Haverhill, Massachusetts, where Dubus would spend the bulk of his academic career teaching literature and creative writing at Bradford College. He admired Ernest Hemingway, Anton Chekhov, and John Cheever.

===Personal difficulties===
Dubus&#x27;s life was marked by several tragedies. His daughter was raped as a young woman, causing Dubus many years of paranoia over his loved ones&#x27; safety. Dubus carried personal firearms to protect himself and those around him, until the night in the late 1980s, when he almost shot a man who was in a drunken argument with his son, Andre, outside a bar in Haverhill, Massachusetts.

Dubus was seriously injured in a car accident on the night of July 23, 1986. He was driving from Boston to his home in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and he stopped to assist two disabled motorists—brother and sister Luis and Luz Santiago. As Dubus assisted the injured Luz to the side of the highway, an oncoming car swerved and hit them. Luis was killed instantly; Luz survived because Dubus had pushed her out of the way. Dubus was critically injured and both his legs were crushed. After a series of unsuccessful operations, his right leg was amputated above the knee, and he eventually lost the use of his left leg. Dubus spent three years undergoing a series of painful operations and extensive physical therapy.

To help Dubus with mounting medical bills, his friends and fellow writers Ann Beattie, E.L. Doctorow, John Irving, Gail Godwin, Stephen King, John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut, and Richard Yates held a special literary benefit in Boston and raised $86,000.

Despite his efforts to walk with a prosthesis, chronic infections led to him using a wheelchair for the remainder of his life, and he battled clinical depression as a result of his condition. Over the course of these struggles Dubus&#x27;s third wife left him, taking with her their two young daughters.

===Final years===
Dubus eventually continued to write after his accident and produced two books of essays—including &quot;Broken Vessels&quot;, which became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize—and a collection of short stories. Dubus also conducted a weekly writers&#x27; workshop in his home.

Dubus spent his later years in Haverhill, until his death from a heart attack in 1999, age 62. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, near his home in Haverhill, Massachusetts.

===Legacy===
Andre Dubus was married three times and fathered six children. His son Andre Dubus III is also an author; his most noted book is the novel &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (1999), which was both a finalist for the National Book Award and the basis for an Academy Award-nominated film of the same title. In 2011, Andre Dubus III published a memoir of his life, &quot;Townie&quot;, which tells of growing up in Haverhill and deals extensively with his relationship with his father and the impoverished conditions faced by his mother and siblings after Dubus left the family for a student.

Dubus was the subject of an essay by Kacey Kowars entitled &quot;A Celebration of Words,&quot; and was also paid tribute to in &quot;Andre Dubus: Memoirs&quot;, a book edited by Kowars and featuring authors such as James Lee Burke, Andre Dubus II, and Andre Dubus III.

Xavier Review Press has published several scholarly titles on Dubus, including a special issue of &quot;Xavier Review&quot; on both Dubus and his son. In 2001, the press released &quot;Andre Dubus: Tributes&quot; edited by Donald Anderson, and in 2003 &quot;Leap of the Heart: Andre Dubus Talking&quot; edited by Ross Gresham.

Professor Olivia Carr Edenfield edited &quot;Conversations with Andre Dubus&quot; (University Press of Mississippi, 2013) and is the author of the critical monograph &quot;Understanding Andre Dubus&quot; (University of South Carolina Press, 2017).

==Writing career==
Although he did write one novel, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; (1967), Dubus considered himself primarily a writer of short stories and novellas. Throughout his career, he published most of his work in small, distinguished literary journals such as &quot;Ploughshares&quot; and &quot;Sewanee Review,&quot; though he also placed stories in magazines such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;. Dubus remained loyal to a small publishing firm run by David R. Godine that published his first works. When larger book publishers approached him with more lucrative deals, Dubus stayed with Godine, switching only to Alfred A. Knopf towards the end of his career to assist with medical bills.

Dubus&#x27;s collections and novellas include: &quot;Separate Flights&quot; (1975), &quot;Adultery and Other Choices&quot; (1977), &quot;Finding a Girl in America&quot; (1980), &quot;The Times Are Never So Bad&quot; (1983), &quot;Voices from the Moon&quot; (1984), &quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot; (1986), &quot;Selected Stories&quot; (1988), &quot;Broken Vessels&quot; (1991), &quot;Dancing After Hours&quot; (1996), and &quot;Meditations from a Movable Chair&quot; (1998). Several writing awards are named after Dubus. His papers are archived at McNeese State University and Xavier University in Louisiana and at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas in Austin.

Italian writer and editor Nicola Manuppelli has translated six collections of short stories and novellas by Dubus for Italian publisher Mattioli 1885: &quot;Separate Flights&quot; (&quot;Voli separati&quot;), &quot;The Times Are Never So Bad&quot; (&quot;I tempi non sono mai così cattivi&quot;), &quot;Voices From The Moon&quot; (&quot;Voci dalla luna&quot;), &quot;We Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (&quot;Non abitiamo più qui&quot;), &quot;Finding a girl in America&quot; (&quot;Il padre d&#x27;inverno&quot;) &quot;Dancing After Hours&quot; (&quot;Ballando a notte fonda&quot;). For the publication of these works, Manuppelli has included introductions or afterwords by several American authors, including Dennis Lehane, Peter Orner, and Tobias Wolff, among others.

In 2017, work began at David R. Godine, Publishers to gather together all of the fiction Dubus released with his longtime and loyal publisher between the mid-1970s and late 1980s. The three-volume collected short stories and novellas was conceived of by series editor Joshua Bodwell and is made up of six of Dubus&#x27;s previous books, two books per volume, plus previously uncollected stories in volume three. The project was a thorough re-launch of the master&#x27;s work: for the first time since Dubus&#x27;s stories were originally published by Godine, all of the interior pages were re-set and re-designed; all new cover photographs were commissioned from Greta Rybus; the paperback originals were given handsome French flaps; and new, original introductions by Ann Beattie, Richard Russo, and Tobias Wolff were commissioned. All three volumes were published in 2018.

==Cinematic adaptations==
After Dubus&#x27;s death, his story &quot;Killings&quot; was adapted into Todd Field&#x27;s &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; (2001) starring Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson, and Marisa Tomei. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards – Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role (Wilkinson), Actress in a Leading Role (Spacek), Actress in a Supporting Role (Tomei), and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Published (Robert Festinger &amp; Field).

The 2004 movie &quot;We Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; is based upon two of Dubus&#x27;s novellas, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; and &quot;Adultery&quot;.

<doc id="944431" wikidata="Q1502131" url="?curid=944431" title="James Abercrombie (British Army officer, born 1732)">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel James Abercrombie (1732 – 23 June 1775) was a British Army officer who died during the American Revolutionary War.

There is much uncertainty about Abercrombie&#x27;s family. He may have been related to the much better known General James Abercrombie, as described in &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopedia of American Biography&quot;, but the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot; states that the common identification of him as the general&#x27;s son or nephew is probably erroneous.

On 11 June 1744 Abercrombie was listed as a newly promoted Lieutenant of the 1st Foot. On 16 February 1756, he was promoted to the rank of Captain in the 42nd Foot. With this rank, he served in the French and Indian War, notably as one of General Abercrombie&#x27;s aides in the Battle of Fort Carillon at Ticonderoga in 1758 before being made aide-de-camp to his successor Jeffrey Amherst in 1759. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1770 and joined British forces assigned to the American colonies under the command of General Thomas Gage.

On 17 June 1775, Abercrombie led his grenadier battalion in their charge of the redoubt on the Americans&#x27; left wing at the Battle of Bunker Hill. During the assault on Breed&#x27;s Hill, he reportedly sustained a large gunshot wound on his right thigh from a black militiaman named Salem Poor, although there is a high probability that friendly fire caused the wound. Abercrombie was evacuated back to Boston and treated in the city&#x27;s army hospital. He succumbed to his wound a week later while being cared for in the home of one of Gage&#x27;s staff officers, military engineer John Montresor.
