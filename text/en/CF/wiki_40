<text>Escherichia virus T4 is a species of bacteriophages that infect &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacteria. It is a double-stranded DNA virus in the subfamily &quot;Tevenvirinae&quot; of the family &quot;Straboviridae&quot;. T4 is capable of undergoing only a lytic life cycle and not the lysogenic life cycle. The species was formerly named T-even bacteriophage, a name which also encompasses, among other strains (or isolates), Enterobacteria phage T2, Enterobacteria phage T4 and Enterobacteria phage T6.

==Use in research==
Dating back to the 1940s and continuing today, T-even phages are considered the best studied model organisms. Model organisms are usually required to be simple with as few as five genes. Yet, T-even phages are in fact among the largest and highest complexity virus, in which these phage&#x27;s genetic information is made up of around 300 genes. Coincident with their complexity, T-even viruses were found to have the unusual base hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC) in place of the nucleic acid base cytosine.

==Genome and structure==
The T4 virus&#x27;s double-stranded DNA genome is about 169 kbp long and encodes 289 proteins. The T4 genome is terminally redundant. Upon DNA replication, long multi-genome length concatemers are formed, perhaps by a rolling circle mechanism of replication. When packaged, the concatemer is cut at unspecific positions of the same length, leading to several genomes that represent circular permutations of the original. The T4 genome bears eukaryote-like intron sequences.

===Translation===
The Shine-Dalgarno sequence GAGG dominates in virus T4 early genes, whereas the sequence GGAG is a target for the T4 endonuclease RegB that initiates the early mRNA degradation.

==Virus particle structure==

T4 is a relatively large virus, at approximately 90 nm wide and 200 nm long (most viruses range from 25 to 200 nm in length). The DNA genome is held in an icosahedral head, also known as a capsid. The T4&#x27;s tail is hollow so that it can pass its nucleic acid into the cell it is infecting after attachment. Myoviridae phages like T4 have complex contractile tail structures with a large number of proteins involved in the tail assembly and function. The tail fibres are also important in recognizing host cell surface receptors, so they determine if a bacterium is within the virus&#x27;s host range.

The structure of the 6 megadalton T4 baseplate that comprises 127 polypeptide chains of 13 different proteins (gene products 5, 5.4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 25, 27, 48 and 53) has recently been described in atomic detail. An atomic model of the proximal region of the tail tube formed by gp54 and the main tube protein gp19 have also been created. The tape measure protein gp29 is present in the baseplate-tail tube complexes, but it could not be modeled.

During assembly of the bacteriophage (phage) T4 virion, the morphogenetic proteins encoded by the phage genes interact with each other in a characteristic sequence. Maintaining an appropriate balance in the amounts of each of these proteins produced during viral infection appears to be critical for normal phage T4 morphogenesis. Phage T4 encoded proteins that determine virion structure include major structural components, minor structural components and non-structural proteins that catalyze specific steps in the morphogenesis sequence. Phage T4 morphogenesis is divided into three independent pathways: the head, the tail and the long tail fibres as detailed by Yap and Rossman.

==Infection process==
The T4 virus initiates an &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; infection by binding OmpC porin proteins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the surface of &quot;E. coli&quot; cells with its long tail fibers (LTF). A recognition signal is sent through the LTFs to the baseplate. This unravels the short tail fibers (STF) that bind irreversibly to the &quot;E. coli&quot; cell surface. The baseplate changes conformation and the tail sheath contracts, causing GP5 at the end of the tail tube to puncture the outer membrane of the cell. The lysozyme domain of GP5 is activated and degrades the periplasmic peptidoglycan layer. The remaining part of the membrane is degraded and then DNA from the head of the virus can travel through the tail tube and enter the &quot;E. coli&quot; cell.

In 1952, Hershey and Chase provided key evidence that the phage DNA, as distinct from protein, enters the host bacterial cell upon infection and is thus the genetic material of the phage. This finding suggested that DNA is, in general, the genetic material of different organisms.

===Reproduction===
The lytic life cycle (from entering a bacterium to its destruction) takes approximately 30 minutes (at 37 °C). Virulent bacteriophages multiply in their bacterial host immediately after entry. After the number of progeny phages reach a certain amount, they cause the host to lyse or break down, therefore they would be released and infect new host cells. The process of host lyses and release is called the lytic cycle. Lytic cycle is a cycle of viral reproduction that involves the destruction of the infected cell and its membrane. This cycle involves a virus that overtakes the host cell and its machinery to reproduce. Therefore, the virus must go through 5 stages in order to reproduce and infect the host cell:
* Adsorption and penetration (starting immediately)
* Arrest of host gene expression (starting immediately)
* Enzyme synthesis (starting after 5 minutes)
* DNA replication (starting after 10 minutes)
* Formation of new virus particles (starting after 12 minutes)
After the life cycle is complete, the host cell bursts open and ejects the newly built viruses into the environment, destroying the host cell. T4 has a burst size of approximately 100-150 viral particles per infected host.

Benzer (1955 – 1959) developed a system for studying the fine structure of the gene using bacteriophage T4 mutants defective in the &quot;rIIA&quot; and &quot;rIIB&quot; genes. The techniques employed were complementation tests and crosses to detect recombination, particularly between deletion mutations. These genetic experiments led to the finding of a unique linear order of mutational sites within the genes. This result provided strong evidence for the key idea that the gene has a linear structure equivalent to a length of DNA with many sites that can independently mutate.

====Adsorption and penetration====

Just like all other viruses, T-even phages do not randomly attach to the surface of their host; instead they &quot;search&quot; and bind to receptors, specific protein structures, found on the surface of the host. These receptors vary with the phage; teichoic acid, cell wall proteins and lipopolysaccharides, flagella, and pili all can serve as receptors for the phage to bind to. In order for the T-even phage to infect its host and begin its life cycle it must enter the first process of infection, adsorption of the phage to the bacterial cell. Adsorption is a value characteristic of phage-host pair and the adsorption of the phage on host cell surface is illustrated as a 2-stage process: reversible and irreversible. It involves the phages tail structure that begins when the phages tail fibers helps bind the phage to the appropriate receptor of its host. This process is reversible. One or more of the components of the base plate mediates irreversible process of binding of the phage to a bacterium.

Penetration is also a value characteristic of phage-host infection that involves the injection of the phages genetic material inside the bacterium. Penetration of nucleic acid takes place after the irreversible adsorption phase. Mechanisms involving penetration of the phages nucleic acid are specific for each phage. This penetration mechanism can involve electrochemical membrane potential, ATP molecules, enzymatic splitting of peptidoglycan layer, or all three of these factor can be vital for the penetration of the nucleic acid inside the bacterial cell. Studies have been done on the T2 bacteriophage (T4-like phage) mechanism of penetration and it has shown that the phage&#x27;s tail does not penetrate inside the bacterial cell wall and penetration of this phage involves electrochemical membrane potential on the inner membrane.

==Replication and packaging==
Virus T4 genome is synthesized within the host cell using rolling circle replication. The time it takes for DNA replication in a living cell was measured as the rate of virus T4 DNA elongation in virus-infected E. coli. During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37 °C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second. The mutation rate per base pair per replication during virus T4 DNA synthesis is 1.7 per 10−8, a highly accurate DNA copying mechanism, with only 1 error in 300 copies. The virus also codes for unique DNA repair mechanisms. The T4 phage head is assembled empty around a scaffolding protein, which is later degraded. Consequently, the DNA needs to enter the prohead through a tiny pore, which is achieved by a hexamer of gp17 interacting with DNA first, which also serves as a motor and nuclease. The T4 DNA packaging motor has been found to load DNA into virus capsids at a rate up to 2000 base pairs per second. The power involved, if scaled up in size, would be equivalent to that of an average automobile engine.

==Release==
The final step in viral reproduction and multiplication is determined by the release of virions from the host cell. The release of the virions occurs after the breakage of the bacterial plasma membrane. Nonenveloped viruses lyse the host cell which is characterized by viral proteins attacking the peptidoglycan or membrane. The lysis of the bacteria occurs when the capsids inside the cell release the enzyme lysozyme which break down the cell wall. The released bacteriophages infect other cells, and the viral multiplication cycle is repeated within those cells.

==Multiplicity reactivation==
Multiplicity reactivation (MR) is the process by which two or more virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, can interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome. Salvador Luria, while studying UV irradiated virus T4 in 1946, discovered MR and proposed that the observed reactivation of damaged virus occurs by a recombination mechanism.(see refs.) This preceded the confirmation of DNA as the genetic material in 1952 in related virus T2 by the Hershey–Chase experiment.

As remembered by Luria (1984, pg. 97) the discovery of reactivation of irradiated virus (referred to as &quot;multiplicity reactivation&quot;) immediately started a flurry of activity in the study of repair of radiation damage within the early phage group (reviewed by Bernstein in 1981). It turned out later that the repair of damaged virus by mutual help that Luria had discovered was only one special case of DNA repair. Cells of all types, not just, bacteria and their viruses, but all organisms studied, including humans, are now known to have complex biochemical processes for repairing DNA damages (see DNA repair). DNA repair processes are also now recognized as playing critical roles in protecting against aging, cancer, and infertility.

MR is usually represented by &quot;survival curves&quot; where survival of plaque forming ability of multiply infected cells (multicomplexes) is plotted against dose of genome damaging agent. For comparison, the survival of virus plaque forming ability of singly infected cells (monocomplexes) is also plotted against dose of genome damaging agent. The top figure shows the survival curves for virus T4 multicomplexes and monocomplexes with increasing dose of UV light. Since survival is plotted on a log scale it is clear that survival of multicomplexes exceeds that of monocomplexes by very large factors (depending on dose). The UV inactivation curve for multicomplexes has an initial shoulder. Other virus T4 DNA damaging agents with shoulders in their multicomplex survival curves are X-rays and ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). The presence of a shoulder has been interpreted to mean that two recombinational processes are used. The first one repairs DNA with high efficiency (in the &quot;shoulder&quot;), but is saturated in its ability as damage increases; the second pathway functions at all levels of damage. Surviving T4 virus released from multicomplexes show no increase in mutation, indicating that MR of UV irradiated virus is an accurate process.

The bottom figure shows the survival curves for inactivation of virus T4 by the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C (MMC). In this case the survival curve for multicomplexes has no initial shoulder, suggesting that only the second recombinational repair process described above is active. The efficiency of repair by this process is indicated by the observation that a dose of MMC that allows survival of only 1 in 1,000 monocomplexes allows survival of about 70% of multicomplexes. Similar multicomplex survival curves (without shoulders) were also obtained for the DNA damaging agents P32 decay, psoralen plus near-UV irradiation (PUVA), N-methyl-N&#x27;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and nitrous acid.

Several of the genes found to be necessary for MR in virus T4 proved to be orthologs for genes essential for recombination in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and archaea. This includes, for instance, T4 gene &quot;uvsX&quot; which specifies a protein that has three-dimensional structural homology to RecA from &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and the homologous protein RAD51 in eukaryotes and RadA in archaea. It has been suggested that the efficient and accurate recombinational repair of DNA damages during MR may be analogous to the recombinational repair process that occurs during meiosis in eukaryotes.

==History==
Bacteriophages were first discovered by the English scientist Frederick Twort in 1915 and Félix d&#x27;Hérelle in 1917. In the late 1930s, T. L. Rakieten proposed either a mixture of raw sewerage or a lysate from &quot;E. coli&quot; infected with raw sewerage to the two researchers Milislav Demerec and Ugo Fano. These two researchers isolated T3, T4, T5, and T6 from &quot;E.coli&quot;. Also, in 1932, the researcher J. Bronfenbrenner had studied and worked on the T2 phage, at which the T2 phage was isolated from the virus. This isolation was made from a fecal material rather than from sewerage. At any rate, Max Delbrück was involved in the discovery of the T even phages. His part was naming the bacteriophages into Type 1(T1), Type 2 (T2), Type 3 (T3), etc.

The specific time and place of T4 virus isolation remains unclear, though they were likely found in sewage or fecal material. T4 and similar viruses were described in a paper by Thomas F. Anderson, Max Delbrück, and Milislav Demerec in November 1944.
In 1943, Salvador Luria and Delbrück showed that bacterial mutations for phage resistance arise in the absence of selection, rather than being a response to selection. The traditional wisdom among bacteriologists prior to 1943 was that bacteria had no chromosomes and no genes. The Luria–Delbrück experiment showed that bacteria, like other established model genetic organisms, have genes, and that these can spontaneously mutate to generate mutants that may then reproduce to form clonal lineages. That year, they also began working with Alfred Hershey, another phage experimenter. (The three would share the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, &quot;for work on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses&quot;.)

The phage group was an informal network of biologists centered on Max Delbrück that carried out basic research mainly on bacteriophage T4 and made numerous seminal contributions to microbial genetics and the origins of molecular biology in the mid-20th century. In 1961, Sydney Brenner, an early member of the phage group, collaborated with Francis Crick, Leslie Barnett and Richard Watts-Tobin at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge to perform genetic experiments that demonstrated the basic nature of the genetic code for proteins. These experiments, carried out with mutants of the rIIB gene of phage T4, showed, that for a gene that encodes a protein, three sequential bases of the gene&#x27;s DNA specify each successive amino acid of the protein. Thus the genetic code is a triplet code, where each triplet (called a codon) specifies a particular amino acid. They also obtained evidence that the codons do not overlap with each other in the DNA sequence encoding a protein, and that such a sequence is read from a fixed starting point.

During 1962-1964 phage T4 researchers provided an opportunity to study the function of virtually all of the genes that are essential for growth of the phage under laboratory conditions. These studies were facilitated by the discovery of two classes of conditional lethal mutants. One class of such mutants is known as amber mutants. Another class of conditional lethal mutants is referred to as temperature-sensitive mutants Studies of these two classes of mutants led to considerable insight into numerous fundamental biologic problems. Thus understanding was gained on the functions and interactions of the proteins employed in the machinery of DNA replication, repair and recombination, and on how viruses are assembled from protein and nucleic acid components (molecular morphogenesis). Furthermore, the role of chain terminating codons was elucidated. One noteworthy study used amber mutants defective in the gene encoding the major head protein of phage T4. This experiment provided strong evidence for the widely held, but prior to 1964 still unproven, &quot;sequence hypothesis&quot; that the amino acid sequence of a protein is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene determining the protein. Thus, this study demonstrated the co-linearity of the gene with its encoded protein.

A number of Nobel Prize winners worked with virus T4 or T4-like viruses including Max Delbrück, Salvador Luria, Alfred Hershey, James D. Watson, and Francis Crick. Other important scientists who worked with virus T4 include Michael Rossmann, Seymour Benzer, Bruce Alberts, Gisela Mosig, Richard Lenski, and James Bull.

<doc id="951836" wikidata="Q476402" url="?curid=951836" title="Battle of Umm Diwaykarat">
<text>The Battle of Umm Diwaykarat on 25 November 1899 marked the final defeat of the Mahdist State in Sudan, when Anglo-Egyptian forces under the command of Lord Kitchener defeated what was left of the Mahdist armies under the command of the Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, known as the Khalifa, after the equally disastrous Battle of Omdurman a year earlier.

==Background==
After Omdurman, the defeated Mahdist forces, still 25,000 strong, moved southward from Khartoum to Kordofan. The Mahdists still controlled the territory of Kordofan, Darfur, and lands bordering Ethiopia. In October 1899 the British obtained information that the Khalifa and his forces were among his native Baggara to the west of Kusti (Kaka) in Kordofan. Kitchener dispatched 8,000 Sudanese and Egyptian soldiers under command of General F.R. Wingate to intercept him. Wingate marched from Kusti to the mountains of Kordofan, destroyed a Mahdist supply unit, and soon located the Khalifa&#x27;s camp.

==Battle==
By this time, the Khalifa&#x27;s Sudanese forces had retained at least 10,000 people. The Khalifa decided to make a stand rather than to retreat further. During the night Wingate approached the camp from the east and the north sides. At about 5am, the Mahdists began to attack the approaching British-led forces, but were driven back by withering fire from Maxim guns. The Khalifa&#x27;s attempts to rally his men failed, and he soon accepted that all was lost. He called his main leaders to sit with him on a farwa – a yearling skin; to wait for death. His guards protected him, but all were mown down by the fire of the Anglo-Egyptian forces.

The Mahdist losses were around 1,000 killed and wounded. The Sudanese/Egyptian forces captured many of the rest, including a son of Emir Yuni.

==Aftermath==
Osman Digna was injured almost at the start of the battle, and fled after being taken from the field; the only Emir to do so. After the defeat, the remnants of the Mahdists continued to resist for a short while under his command, but he was caught in January 1900. The last unoccupied territories of Darfur were captured in 1916.

<doc id="951838" wikidata="Q16187041" url="?curid=951838" title="John Delaney (Florida politician)">
<text>John Adrian Delaney (born June 29, 1956) is an American lawyer, politician, and university and college President. He served as mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, from 1995 to 2003, and as the president of the University of North Florida from 2003 to 2018. In 2021, he was named President of Flagler College after a few months as Interim. He is a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life==
Delaney was born in Lansing, Michigan, and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. His family moved to Jacksonville when he was sixteen. His father, Jim, was a mid-level executive with General Motors, retiring from GM in 1982, and retiring again in the mid-1990’s after being later-rehired by GM. His mother, Mary Anne (Langius) was a school teacher, retiring after John and his brothers were born. Her father, Adrian Nelson (Gus) Langius was the long time State of Michigan architect (FAIA) and state building director. Jim and Mary Anne went to high school together, but did not start dating until sophomores at college. Mary Anne transferred from the University of Michigan to Jim&#x27;s Michigan State University, where both graduated. 

John has two younger brothers, James Langius (Gus,) a retired long time budget analyst and auditor for the state of Florida, and Joe, a crime analyst for the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office. 

He graduated from Terry Parker High School in 1974. He was captain of the debate team, was a regional champion and was offered a number of debate scholarships to colleges/universities, including to the University of Florida. He declined the scholarships to focus on his studies. 

At the University of Florida, he joined Delta Upsilon fraternity, graduated in 3 years and received a B.A. in 1977. He did some post-baccalaureate work before starting law school in 1978. In 1981, he received a J.D. from the University of Florida Levin College of Law, passing the bar the same year. He later received an honorary doctorate from Edward Waters College, now Edward Waters University. 

Delaney and his wife Gena met in 1979 and married in 1980. She graduated from UF, then went on after their first two children were born to obtain a Nursing degree. She worked at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital. They reside in Neptune Beach, a town on a barrier island off the coast of the mainland of Jacksonville. Their house is the home Gena grew up in. They have four children: Bill (Katie), Adrian (Will) Milford, Meg (Drake) Skinner and Jimmy (Payton.) John and Gena have five grandchildren. They also helped raise a niece (Rebecca Keeney (Maldonado) (Husband Jorge) and a nephew Nathan Keeney (Paola) when Gena&#x27;s oldest sister died in a car crash in 1987. Rebecca and Nathan have three children total. Bill is a published author and co-owner of the blog, The Jaxon and of the local magazine, Edible. Gena retired from nursing when John was elected Mayor to care for their children, and to also help care for her mother. (Both of Gena&#x27;s parents lived with the Delaney&#x27;s until their deaths in 1985 and 1997, respectively.) 

Delaney graduated law school and passed the Florida Bar exam in 1981 and was hired by then State Attorney Ed Austin, becoming Austin&#x27;s chief assistant state attorney in 1985. He was the youngest Chief Assistant of the 20 judicial circuits in the state at the time, and still was when he left the courthouse in 1991. Austin became a second father figure and a role model to Delaney and to many of the thousands who worked for Austin. Austin was one of the most influential figures in Jacksonville history. When Austin was elected mayor of Jacksonville in 1991, Delaney became the city&#x27;s general counsel for two years, and served as Austin&#x27;s chief of staff for two years. Delaney ran for mayor himself in 1995 when Austin declined to seek a second term. Austin endorsed Delaney.

==Mayor of Jacksonville==

In 1995, Delaney defeated former mayors Jake Godbold and Tommy Hazouri to become Mayor of the City of Jacksonville, Florida, serving two consecutive terms from 1995 to 2003. The City of Jacksonville and County of Duval were merged into a consolidated city/county government in the 1960’s, retaining the moniker of Jacksonville. The city is the largest in land area in the continental United States, and approximately the 12th largest city in population in the country. 

He was the first Republican elected to the position since 1888. Other than when the city and county were consolidated into a unified city/county government, he is the only Jacksonville mayor to run without opposition since the city was formed in the 1820’s. That election was in 1999, when he ran unopposed for his second term. He was succeeded by John Peyton in July 2003.

In the same 1995 election, Nat Glover, a Democrat. was elected sheriff, the first African-American sheriff elected in Florida since Reconstruction. Glover, despite being massively outspent, defeated the two major party endorsed candidates in the jungle primary (where all candidates, regardless of party affiliation) and did not have to campaign in a run off. Delaney and Glover were acquaintances as Glover was a senior Jacksonville Sheriff Office director while Delaney was chief assistant state attorney. The two became very close personal friends, and each supported each other&#x27;s initiatives throughout their tenure. Glover later joined Delaney at UNF as a special advisor for several years before Glover became president of Edward Waters College, now Edward Waters University. The two remain personally close, and Glover remains both popular and influential in local politics. 
During his mayoral term, Delaney was noted for launching the Better Jacksonville Plan, a massive, multi-billion dollar package of projects for municipal improvements funded by a referendum. The plan called for spending $2.25 billion (approximately $5.5b in 2020 dollars.) The referendum passed 58–42%. This paid for roads, bridges, water and sewer expansion, environmental clean up, land acquisition for parks, bike paths, neighborhood and regional libraries, and four new downtown buildings: the Baseball Grounds, a Triple A baseball facility; a new arena; new county courthouse, and new central library. He also started the Preservation Project, a series of land acquisitions for parks. As a result, Jacksonville has the largest park system of any American city, approximately 100 square miles. 

He cut the tax rate by 10% over his term while able to enhance services through efficiencies, privatization, and outsourcing. When combined with his predecessor Mayor Ed Austin&#x27;s term, the headcount of civilian (non-police or firefighter) city employees were cut by between 1/4 and 1/3 between 1991 and 2003 depending on the methodology used to measure headcount. There were no lay-offs during his tenure. 

He was one of the most popular mayors in Jacksonville&#x27;s history, enjoying consistently high approval ratings and running unopposed for his second election. He worked to be bi-partisan and inclusive, leaving office with approval ratings for Republicans and Democrats, and for white and African Americans above 80%. 

He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by the historically Black Edward Waters College, now Edward Waters University. 

In 2003, he received the &quot;President&#x27;s Conservation Achievement Award&quot; from the Nature Conservancy for the Preservation Project.

==University of North Florida==
Delaney was appointed president of the University of North Florida (UNF) in 2003. During his tenure the university saw a surge of building projects, including a new student union and other facilities. Under his leadership, the university launched an initiative to identify and strengthen its top &quot;flagship&quot; programs. Since 2005, six programs have been established as flagships: nursing, transportation and logistics, international business, coastal biology, nutrition and dietetics, and music. 

The endowment tripled during his tenure, and he roughly doubled the building space with new construction, and renovated much of the remaining. 

Further, academic admission standards increased dramatically, with entering freshmen with approximately a 4.3 grade point average and a 1300 SAT score. 

He retired from UNF in May 2018. The university&#x27;s student union facility was renamed the John A. Delaney Student Union by the UNF Board in his honor. The faculty recommended and the board approved naming him president emeritus. Only the founding president, Tom Carpenter, has been given that distinction. 

In October 2008, John Delaney was named interim chancellor of the State University System of Florida, remaining UNF president while doing double duty. He took over for Mark B. Rosenberg who had resigned to return to Florida International University. He served for the 2009 legislative session, and was not paid any compensation. In October 2009, Frank T. Brogan became the new chancellor of the State University System.

===Post 2018===
Delaney joined the Rogers Towers Law Firm and the Fiorentino Group, a business consulting and governmental lobbying firm. He remains Of Counsel to both firms while serving as president for Flagler College. 

===Flagler College===
In November, 2020, Flagler named Delaney as interim president, starting on the retirement of President Joe Joyner in July 2021. In October, 2021, the college asked John to remove the Interim label, and become the &quot;permanent&quot; president.

<text>Charlene Keys (born January 21, 1971), better known by the stage name Tweet, is an American singer-songwriter.

==Career==
===Early career===
In the early nineties, Tweet joined the female trio Sugah, leaving her daughter with her parents in Panama City, Florida. Sugah was composed of Tweet, Susan Weems, and Rolita White, and was a part of Devante Swing&#x27;s Swing Mob collective. While there, she met Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott, with whom she formed a close friendship. Around 1999, Tweet returned to her parents&#x27; home in Panama City.

In 2001, Tweet was featured on Missy Elliott&#x27;s platinum-selling third album, &quot;Miss E... So Addictive&quot;, with her featuring on one track and providing background vocals to another four. She also contributed background vocals to Ja Rule&#x27;s &quot;Pain Is Love&quot;, Bubba Sparxxx&#x27;s &quot;Dark Days, Bright Nights&quot;, Timbaland and Magoo&#x27;s &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, and Petey Pablo&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry&quot;.

===2002–04: &quot;Southern Hummingbird&quot;===
In March 2002, Tweet released her debut solo single, &quot;Oops (Oh My)&quot;. The song was produced by Timbaland and features guest vocals by Missy Elliott. The single hit number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In April 2002, Tweet released her debut album &quot;Southern Hummingbird&quot;. The album featured production by Craig Brockman, Nisan Stewart, guitarist John &quot;Jubu&quot; Smith, Timbaland, and Tweet herself. The album includes features from Elliott, Bilal, and Ms. Jade. The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album spawned two follow-up singles: the Timbaland-produced &quot;Call Me&quot; and &quot;Smoking Cigarettes&quot;.

In 2002, Tweet appeared as a guest vocalist on Trina&#x27;s second single &quot;No Panties&quot; her album &quot;Diamond Princess&quot;. Tweet also appeared as a background vocalist on Meshell Ndegeocello&#x27;s &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;, Karen Clark Sheard&#x27;s &quot;2nd Chance&quot;, Ms. Jade&#x27;s &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot;, Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Just Whitney...&quot; and Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Under Construction&quot;. For the latter, Tweet appeared on four of the tracks and made cameo performances in two videos released from the album, &quot;Work It&quot; and &quot;Gossip Folks&quot;. Among others, Tweet appeared in the music video for Aaliyah&#x27;s posthumous hit single, &quot;Miss You&quot;.

Tweet was nominated for a Soul Train Lady of Soul Award for Best New Artist but lost to Ashanti. That year Tweet was awarded the Key to the City for Rochester, New York.

In 2003, Tweet appeared as a background vocalist on the following releases: Madonna&#x27;s &quot;American Life The Remixes Single&quot;, Monica&#x27;s &quot;After the Storm&quot;, Mark Ronson&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes the Fuzz&quot;, and Angie Stone&#x27;s &quot;Stone Love&quot; on the 2004 Grammy Award-nominated song &quot;U-Haul&quot;.

In 2003, Tweet had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Honey&quot; and contributed the song &quot;Thugman&quot; for its soundtrack.

===2005–07: &quot;It&#x27;s Me Again&quot;===
During 2003 and 2004, Tweet began recording songs for her follow-up to &quot;Southern Hummingbird&quot;. The album was supposed to be released in early 2004, but was pushed back when Tweet moved from Elektra Entertainment Group to Atlantic Records in 2004. In late 2004, Tweet released the single &quot;Turn da Lights Off. The song was produced by Missy Elliott and Kwamé, featured vocals from Elliott and contained a sample of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;If This World Were Mine&quot; and Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Lost April&quot;. To promote the single, Tweet joined Cee-Lo Green and Teedra Moses on the 2004 Seagram&#x27;s Gin Live Tour. The same year, Tweet appeared in Elliott&#x27;s music video &quot;I&#x27;m Really Hot&quot;. Tweet also appeared on the posthumous unreleased Elliott-produced Aaliyah track &quot;Where Could He Be&quot;.

On March 22, 2005, Tweet released her second album &quot;It&#x27;s Me Again&quot;. The album featured production from Missy Elliott on several of the tracks. The album featured vocals from Tweet&#x27;s 15-year-old daughter, Tashawna, on &quot;Two of Us&quot;, Rell and Missy Elliott were also featured. &quot;When I Need a Man&quot; (theme song from the USA Network Original Series, Kojak) was included as a hidden track. The album peaked at #17 on the Billboard album charts and then quickly fell off the charts. Tweet then broke away from her manager, Mona Scott, and Violator Management, and signed with Mathew Knowles of Music World.

Tweet appeared on Elliott&#x27;s sixth album release, &quot;The Cookbook&quot;, contributing vocals to three tracks, including the single &quot;Teary Eyed&quot;.

===2007–16: &quot;Simply Tweet&quot; and &quot;Charlene&quot;===
In 2007, Tweet performed with Timbaland, Eve, Keyshia Cole, Nelly Furtado, Fat Man Scoop and Ciara at the 4th annual VH1 Hip Hop Honors, honoring the work of Missy Elliott which aired on October 8. The same year, she departed from Missy Elliott&#x27;s Goldmind Inc. camp and signed to Jheryl Busby and Mike City&#x27;s record label, Umbrella Recordings. There, she began recording material for her third album along with producers Nisan Stewart, Warryn Campbell and Novel. Initially titled &quot;Love, Tweet&quot;, the album was preceded by the buzz single &quot;Good Bye My Dear&quot;, a collaboration with rapper T.I., and expected to be released on April 8, 2008. The release of lead single &quot;Anymore&quot; failed to materialize however. On April 26 and 27, 2008, Tweet along with Bilal, Dwele and German singer Joy Denalane performed with The Dresden Soul Symphony in Dresden, Germany. The quartet reinterpreted soul hits and combined them with classical music. An album &quot;The Dresden Soul Symphony&quot; and DVD were later released on October 24, 2008.

In 2010, Tweet split from Umbrella due to a lack of promotion and ongoing delays. In late 2011, Tweet signed to MC Lyte&#x27;s record label DuBose Music Group. In June 2012, she began posting previously unreleased material from the &quot;It&#x27;s Me Again&quot; and &quot;Love, Tweet&quot; recording sessions on her new website as a part of her weekly SoundCloud-hosted special, &quot;Tweet Tuesdays&quot;. In February 2013, DuBose released her &quot;Simply Tweet&quot; EP. Recorded live with a full band, the five-track set was preceded by the single &quot;Enough&quot;. The digital extended play reached the top thirty on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

In July 2015, Tweet confirmed that she had signed with the independent eOne Music label. Her third regular studio album &quot;Charlene&quot;, featuring production from Missy Elliott, is expected to be released on January 22, 2016, in the United States, with its lead single to be released on September 21, 2015. On February 29, 2016, the &#x27;Hummingbird&#x27; singer sat down with Lindsey Sullivan (of &quot;Billboard&quot;) to discuss her new album &quot;Charlene&quot;. During the interview Tweet mentioned her excitement teaming up with Timbaland and Missy Elliott. She also stated the album was a growing experience.

<text>Hiram Frederick Moody III (born October 18, 1961) is an American novelist and short story writer best known for the 1994 novel &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, a chronicle of the dissolution of two suburban Connecticut families over Thanksgiving weekend in 1973, which brought him widespread acclaim, became a bestseller, and was made into the film &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;. Many of his works have been praised by fellow writers and critics alike.

==Early life and education==
Moody was born in New York City to banker and investment strategist Hiram Frederick Moody, Jr., and Margaret Maureen, daughter of Francis Marion Flynn, president and publisher of &quot;The New York News&quot;. The Moody family were resident in Maine for generations from around 1680; Moody&#x27;s father was born there, but his parents subsequently lived at Winchester, Massachusetts. Moody grew up in several Connecticut suburbs, including Darien and New Canaan, where he later set stories and novels. He graduated from St. Paul&#x27;s School in New Hampshire and Brown University.

He received a Master of Fine Arts degree from Columbia University in 1986; nearly two decades later he would criticize the program in an essay in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Soon after finishing his thesis, he checked himself into a mental hospital for alcoholism.

==Career==
Once sober and while working for Farrar, Straus and Giroux, he wrote his first novel, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Garden State&quot;, about young people growing up in the industrial wasteland of northern New Jersey, where he was living at the time. In his introduction to the 1997 reprint of the novel, he called it the most &quot;naked&quot; thing he has written.

Moody&#x27;s second novel, 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, was his critically praised breakthrough. Adam Begley, writing for the Chicago Tribune, called it &quot;A bitter and loving and damning tribute to the American family... This is a good book, packed with keen observation and sympathy for human failure&quot;. His third novel, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Purple America&quot; also received praise. Occurring over a single weekend, the story of Hex Radcliffe&#x27;s visit to suburban Connecticut was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;breathtaking...The novel is wonderfully convincing about the contrary, almost arbitrary shifts that seem to lie at the heart of human feeling.&quot;

2001&#x27;s &quot;Demonology&quot;, a short story collection, received particular attention for its title story, of which Nicci Gerrard wrote: &quot;It is about the death of a sister, whose life he offers to us in snapshots: her childhood, her motherhood, her sudden death. &#x27;I should have a better ending,&#x27; he says. &#x27;I shouldn&#x27;t say her life was short and often sad, I shouldn&#x27;t say she had her demons, as I do too...&#x27; It is tempting to think of this beautiful and melancholy coda to Rick Moody&#x27;s stories as the appearance of the author, stepping out of the shadows at last, particularly since the first story in the collection is also, though much more obliquely, about the death of a beloved sister.&quot;

Moody&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Black Veil&quot; (2002) won the NAMI/Ken Book Award and the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for the Art of the Memoir. &quot;The Diviners&quot; was released in 2005. Little, Brown and Company, the publisher of &quot;The Diviners&quot;, changed the cover after the galleys came out because women reacted negatively to it. The original cover showed a Conan the Barbarian-type image in technicolor orange; the new cover uses that same image, but frames it as a scene on a movie screen. &quot;The Diviners&quot; was followed in 2007 by &quot;Right Livelihoods&quot;, a collection of three novellas published in Britain and Ireland as &quot;The Omega Force&quot;. &quot;The Four Fingers of Death&quot; was released July 28, 2010 by Little, Brown and Company. In 2012, he won Italy&#x27;s Fernanda Pivano Award. 2015&#x27;s &quot;Hotels of North America&quot;, his most recent novel, was named a best book of the year by NPR and the Washington Post.

His second memoir, &quot;The Long Accomplishment&quot; was published in 2019.

In addition to his fiction, Moody is a musician and composer. He belongs to a group called the Wingdale Community Singers, which he describes as performing &quot;woebegone and slightly modernist folk music, of the very antique variety.&quot; Moody composed the song &quot;Free What&#x27;s-his-name,&quot; performed by Fly Ashtray on their 1997 EP &quot;Flummoxed,&quot; collaborated with One Ring Zero on the EP &quot;Rick Moody and One Ring Zero&quot; in 2004, and also contributed lyrics to One Ring Zero&#x27;s albums &quot;As Smart As We Are,&quot; &quot;Memorandum,&quot; and &quot;Planets&quot;.

In 2006, an essay by Moody was included in Sufjan Stevens&#x27;s box-set &quot;Songs for Christmas&quot;.

In 2013, he published the first interview with David Bowie after the release of &quot;The Next Day.&quot; In 2016, he co-wrote three songs with Tanya Donnely on her new Swan Song Series album.

in 2007, when asked by the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; what he thought was the best book of American fiction from 1975 to 2000, Moody chose Grace Paley&#x27;s &quot;The Collected Stories&quot;.

In 2001, Rick Moody co-founded the New York Public Library&#x27;s Young Lions Fiction Award with Ethan Hawke, Hannah McFarland, and Jennifer Rudolph Walsh.

Moody is a co-host, along with One Ring Zero&#x27;s Michael Hearst, for the 18:59 Podcast series.

==Personal life==
He lives in Brooklyn and Dutchess County, and he is married to the visual artist Laurel Nakadate.

==Awards==
&quot;Garden State&quot; won the Pushcart Editor&#x27;s Choice Award.
Moody has since received the Addison Metcalf Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the &quot;Paris Review&quot; Aga Khan Prize, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. His work has appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Conjunctions&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;Grand Street&quot;.

==Praise==
Literary critics have praised Moody&#x27;s writing.
In 1999 &quot;The New Yorker&quot; chose him as one of America&#x27;s most talented young writers, placing him on their &quot;20 Writers for the 21st Century&quot; list.

Of the novel &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; (later produced as the movie starring Sigourney Weaver), &quot;Hungry Mind Review&quot; commented that it “works on so many levels, and is so smartly written, that it should establish Rick Moody as one of his generation&#x27;s bellwether voices.&quot; The London &quot;Sunday Times&quot; wrote &quot;This is a blackly funny, beautifully written novel. It is also remarkably mature, containing far more insights about family life and far more wisdom than any 29-year-old author should reasonably possess.&quot;

Reviews of Moody’s novel &quot;Purple America&quot; continued in this vein. &quot;Salon&quot; commented: &quot;Reading Purple America can feel like dancing a quadrille with four very different partners. On we go, propelled from consciousness to consciousness by Moody&#x27;s prodigious gift for ventriloquism and large, supple vocabulary.&quot; &quot;Details&quot; was also positive: &quot;You come up gasping on the last page.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called it &quot;ambitious, stylistically dazzling and heartfelt.&quot; &quot;Booklist&quot; states: &quot;Closely interknitting his narrative with the lyrical, soaring monologues of all the key players, Moody effortlessly moves from one striking passage to the next...it&#x27;s the characters&#x27; voices, so full of urgency and distress, that are unforgettable.&quot; And &quot;The Paris Review&quot; wrote that it was with &quot;Purple America&quot; that &quot;Moody’s reputation as a prose stylist began to be cast. Purple America’s surgically deft formal construction, its loping, labyrinthine sentences and stunning ear for both the comic and dramatic (often within the same breath) press the reader through a weekend in the life of the Raitliffes, a Connecticut family—foremost, Billie Raitliffe, late-term victim of a degenerative nerve disease and mother of Hex, the alcoholic, stuttering hero. As the novel asserts at the end of the first chapter: “if he’s a hero, then heroes are five-and-dime, and the world is as crowded with them as it is with stray pets, worn tires, and missing keys.”

In 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewed Moody’s collection of novellas &quot;Right Livelihoods&quot;, describing &quot;The Albertine Notes&quot; as “one of the best stories to appear in the new millennium; it underscores that Rick Moody is one of our best writers.” Irish weekly &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot; called the story “a symbolic reaction to the crisis of instability in American identity today” and remarked that the collection as a whole “brilliantly reflects the unease and baroque insecurities of the post-9/11 nation.&quot;

Michael Chabon and Thomas Pynchon gave high praise for the memoir, &quot;The Black Veil,&quot; the former calling it &quot;a unique blend of wrenching emotion and human playfulness,&quot; the latter saying Moody &quot;writing with boldness, humor, generosity of spirit, and a welcome sense of wrath, takes the art of the memoir an important step into its future.&quot;

His 2005 novel &quot;The Diviners&quot; received praise as well. &quot;If you like watching the smartest kid in the room do his stuff,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The Diviners is like a Broadway musical filled with nothing but showstoppers, as Moody performs one bravura set piece after another. Brooke Allen, writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, said that &quot;Rick Moody is one of the most prodigiously talented writers in America...like a master ventriloquist, Mr. Moody fills &quot;The Diviners&quot; with stunning little monologues...In the novel&#x27;s most impressive display of technical prowess, Mr. Moody even puts himself inside the head of an autistic boy—and makes us feel that he has gotten it right.&quot;

The &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction,&quot; in their June 2003 issue, says of Moody&#x27;s writing:

&quot;Within Moody&#x27;s fictional treatments, the reader is necessarily one step removed from experience. We are engaged within a tight fuselage-world of the rendered text, an intricate and highly original language system wherein lurks characters sustained by the exertion of words, like the music sustained by the exertion of piano keys. Indeed, Moody&#x27;s characters are like word-chords whose considerable tribulations and emotional woundings are never the central fact of the text, but rather convincing casings, occasions to press ink on paper. Voices emerge--language projections that ignite from plot moments, from brutal experience set to the available music of language, characters finally as sonic events who inhabit a geography of print.&quot;
&quot;Esquire&quot; describes Moody as &quot;that rare writer who can make the language do tricks and still suffuse his narrative with soul.&quot;

Lydia Millet, in a 2001 article for &quot;The Village Voice,&quot; described Moody as &quot;equipped with subtle but powerful typographic tools—the vibrant and pervasive Bernhardian italic phrase, pregnant with meaning, the elegant Joycean em dash denoting dialogue—Moody strikes me as a self-styled avenging angel of highbrow literary cool. Underneath the Clark Kentish exterior lurks a crypto-Superman schooled in semiotics and steeped in pop culture, one eyebrow permanently raised at the unsightly stupidity of the masses.&quot;

Janet Burroway, in a 2001 article for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; wrote that Moody &quot;has been compared to John Cheever, with ample justification. He has the same knockabout whimsy careering into keen lament. But Mr. Moody&#x27;s work has a distinctive rawness; it&#x27;s more steeped in rage. He&#x27;s also funnier, and to that degree less reconciled to the world as he finds it. Cheever had less to forgive; the waterfall of language here is full of toxic sludge. Perhaps this is only to say that John Cheever belonged to midcentury, while Rick Moody is a chronicler of the middle class for the millennium.&quot;

His most recent novel, 2015&#x27;s &quot;Hotels of North America,&quot; received widespread critical praise. Dwight Garner wrote in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;...this is Mr. Moody’s best novel in many years. It’s a little book, a bagatelle, but it’s a little book of irony and wit and heartbreak. It is insightful on topics like the joy of stockpiling hotel hair-care products while also asking the big questions, such as, &#x27;Which man among us is not, most of the time, possessed of the desire to curl himself into a fetal ball.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Hotels of North America&quot; was described by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; as &quot;formally daring, often very funny and surprisingly moving. It should earn Moody new fans from a millennial cohort that was still in diapers back when he was basking in his early critical acclaim.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Novelist and critic Dale Peck unfavorably reviewed Moody&#x27;s &quot;The Black Veil&quot; in &quot;The New Republic,&quot; a review so harsh it has become infamous in literary circles. Peck began the review with the sentence &quot;Rick Moody is the worst writer of his generation,&quot; arguing that Moody&#x27;s writing is &quot;pretentious, muddled, derivative, [and] bathetic.&quot; Peck has since said of his lede, &quot;When I wrote a sentence like &#x27;Rick Moody is the worst writer of his generation,&#x27; in my head, I&#x27;m imagining 50 people reading that line. I&#x27;m imagining 50 people reading it in context. The very next line, which is an apology for the opening line of the review, says that that line is meaningless.&quot; Moody and Peck have since participated in a pie throwing for charity and appeared together on a panel about Thomas Bernhard.

In the online journal &quot;The Rumpus&quot;, Moody slammed pop-country star Taylor Swift and her music, labeling her lyrics &quot;artificial and repellent&quot; and equating its interest to that of Olestra-based products, Swiffers, tiered Jell-O dessert products, home cosmetic surgery, and rectal bleaching. After commenters objected to Moody&#x27;s anti-Swift screed, Moody took to &quot;Salon&quot; and wrote &quot;I am happy, in the end, that a lot of young women like Taylor Swift. I am glad they have music they love, even if I believe they will be bored of her ultimately, just as I once was happy about the Bay City Rollers, or Sweet, or Alice Cooper, or, differently, Kiss, even though I recognized that music was kitsch... But it’s the job of the critic to sort through the collision of contemporary music with the history of the form and to assess music based on more enduring values, which are, it’s true, partly subjective, but which also come to rest on an understanding of what music has been&quot;.

<text>Edward Rainbowe or Rainbow (1608–1684) was an English academic, Church of England clergyman and a noted preacher. He was Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and Bishop of Carlisle.

==Life==
He was born on 20 April 1608 at Blyton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, where his father Thomas Rainbowe was vicar. His mother, Rebecca, daughter of David Allen, rector of the neighbouring parish of Ludborough, was educated in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Edward&#x27;s godfather, Edward Wray of Rycot, was second son of Sir Edward Wray of Glentworth in Lincolnshire. The Wrays possessed influence, and the connection proved important to the young Rainbowe. 

After spending a short time at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s High School, Gainsborough, he was sent in April 1620 to Peterborough, to be under Dr John Williams, then one of the prebendaries, and an old friend of his father. When, in the following year, Williams was preferred to the deanery of Westminster and bishopric of Lincoln, Rainbowe moved to Westminster School. From Westminster he proceeded in July 1623 to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as scholar, but in 1625 he received from Frances, dowager countess of Warwick, a nomination to one of the scholarships founded at Magdalene College, Cambridge, by her father, Sir Christopher Wray. He graduated B.A. in 1627, M.A. in 1630, B.D. in 1637, and D.D. in 1643. He was elected a fellow of Magdalene in 1633 and Master in 1642. While &quot;in statu pupillari&quot; he was suddenly called on by the vice-chancellor to act as &quot;terræ filius&quot; in place of one who was deprived of the office on account of his scurrility. Rainbowe was facetious but acquitted himself to the satisfaction of his auditors. 

In July 1630 he accepted the mastership of a school at Kirton-in-Lindsey, but soon moved with some Cambridge contemporaries to London, settling first in Fuller&#x27;s Rents, and afterwards at Sion College, so as to make use of the library. He took holy orders, and preached his first sermon in April 1632. After making an unsuccessful application for the chaplaincy to the society of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, he was appointed curate at the Savoy Hospital.

In November 1633 he was recalled to Cambridge. The master and fellows of Magdalene College elected him to a by-fellowship on the foundation of Dr Goch, with a promise of the first open founder&#x27;s fellowship that should fall vacant. He became a successful tutor, numbering among his pupils two sons of the Earl of Suffolk, with whom he became intimate, and two of Francis Leke, Baron Deincourt. The noble families of Northumberland, Warwick, and Orrery also showed him favour. In 1637 he accepted the small living of Childerley, near Cambridge; in 1637 he became dean of Magdalene; and in 1642 Master, by the gift of the Earl of Suffolk. From the mastership he was dismissed, by order of parliament, in 1650. In 1652 he accepted from the Earl of Suffolk the small living of Little Chesterford in Essex. He became rector of Benefield in Northamptonshire in 1658, by the presentation of the Earl of Warwick, after the Earl of Orrery had obtained for him induction without the intervention of the ‘Tryers.’

On the Restoration in 1660, Rainbowe was restored to his mastership at Cambridge, and appointed chaplain to the king. In the following year he was made Dean of Peterborough, and moved there; but he returned to Cambridge on being appointed vice-chancellor in November 1662. In 1664 he was elected bishop of Carlisle, on the translation of Dr Richard Sterne to York. Rainbowe was consecrated in July 1664, in London, by Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, and in September in the same year he arrived at his palace of Rose Castle, near Dalston, in Cumberland. He had to borrow money to pay for the charges of his consecration, first-fruits, and his journey and settlement in his diocese; and the ruined state of his palace involved him in building, and in litigation about dilapidations with his predecessor and metropolitan, Sterne. Rainbowe found his diocese required reform. Negligent clergy publicly affronted their bishop, and his outspoken denunciation of immorality appears to have offended some great lady about the court. In years of scarcity, when his own stores were exhausted, he bought barley and distributed it to the poor. To the poor at Carlisle and Dalston he made regular allowances. He paid for the education of poor boys at Dalston Grammar School, and for putting them out as apprentices; he supported poor scholars at the universities; he subscribed largely to the French Protestants and to foreign converts. Dalston Grammar School was given an endowment by Rainbowe; the original endowment was looted during the English Civil War.

Rainbowe died on 26 March 1684, and was buried, by his own request, at Dalston (1 April), under a plain stone, with a simple inscription. His wife Elizabeth, daughter of Dr Henry Smyth (his predecessor as master of Magdalene), whom he married in 1652, survived him. After his death she resided chiefly at Dalemain with her sister&#x27;s son, Sir Edward Hasell. She died in 1702, and was also buried in Dalston churchyard.

==Works==
Rainbowe was famous as a preacher. In later life he abandoned the ornate rhetoric of his early days for plainness. Three of his sermons were printed; the first of these, &quot;Labour forbidden and commanded&quot; (London, 1635, 4to), was preached at St Paul&#x27;s Cross on 23 September 1634. Rainbowe planned a treatise, to be called &quot;Verba Christi&quot;, a collection of Christ&#x27;s discourses and sayings, but it was never completed. With his life, by Jonathan Banks (anon. 1688), appear some meditations by him, and one or two short poems, as well as the sermon preached at his funeral by his chancellor, Thomas Tully.

<text>Our Lady of Ipswich (also known as Our Lady of Grace) was a Marian shrine in Ipswich before the English Reformation. Among Marian shrines, only the shrine at Walsingham attracted more visitors.

==Background==

For centuries, England has been known as &#x27;Our Lady&#x27;s Dowry&#x27;. Anglo-Saxon England sheltered many shrines to the Virgin Mary: shrines were dedicated to her at Glastonbury in 540, Evesham in 702, Tewkesbury in 715, Canterbury in 866, Willesden in 939, Abingdon before 955, Ely in 1020, Coventry in 1043, York in 1050, and Walsingham in 1061. By the High Middle Ages there were sixteen shrines to Mary in Suffolk alone.

About half of the medieval churches in Suffolk were dedicated to St Mary under a particular title or devotion. Churches not dedicated to Mary, would have contained a Marian shrine, generally at the east end of the south aisle. Some shrines became so popular that they were translated to buildings of their own. This may be how the shrine of Our Lady of Grace came to be. During the High Middle Ages, the shrine of Our Lady of Grace was second only to that of Our Lady of Walsingham.

==History==
The medieval town of Ipswich was a busy maritime centre of trade and shipbuilding. The inns and taverns of the town were full of pilgrims. The shrine to Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich is first recorded in 1152.

The shrine of Our Lady of Grace in Lady Lane was just outside the west gate of the medieval town wall of Ipswich, on Lady Lane near St Mary at the Elms Church. The site is marked by a plaque and a statue of Our Lady. 

In 1297 the daughter of Edward I, Princess Elizabeth, married the Count of Holland at the shrine.

Among surviving mentions, it is recorded that Sir John Howard paid a visit in August 1463, when his main residence was at Stoke-by-Nayland. On that occasion he apparently left an offering of 2d. At a visit on 5 May, the now Lord Howard spent a total of 10s on a pilgrimage to the shrine. At a visit on 22 January 1472 he left 10d. John Howard was of royal descendant and at least by 1470 a wealthy man, a grandson of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. Howard had shown himself a close friend and loyal supporter of the King Richard III. It was, therefore, now as the new Duke of Norfolk that Howard visited the shrine again, on 16 August 1483, leaving an offering of 20d, then 4d &quot;to bow on Owr Ladys fote&quot; (presumably a particular offering on kissing the foot of the statue) and also 11d &quot;in almes at Owr Lady of Grace&quot;. Howard was to die with his royal patron at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485.

After the Tudor dynasty had consolidated its hold on the English throne, Henry VII&#x27;s queen, Elizabeth of York, made a donation in 1502 of half a golden angel (3s 4d) to the shrine.
 Between 1517 and 1522, Henry VIII and Queen Catherine of Aragon paid separate visits to the shrine, as did Sir Thomas More and Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who was born in Ipswich.

==The Maid of Ipswich==
The image of the Virgin at Ipswich became celebrated on account of a miraculous power of healing attributed to Our Lady of Grace in the early 16th century. The miracle at the shrine of Our Lady of Ipswich is recorded by Sir Thomas More in his book &quot;The Supplication of Souls&quot;, and he claimed he had news of it from a direct witness. The miracle was bestowed on Anne Wentworth, the 12-year-old daughter of Sir Roger Wentworth, a friend of More&#x27;s. Anne suffered from seizures in which she spasmed, blasphemed and was said to be able to utter prophesy &quot;vexed and tourmented by our gostly enemye the devyll&quot;. After a vision in which she beheld the image of Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich, she was taken to the shrine and &quot;layde before the ymage of our Blessyd Lady...grevously tourmented and in face, eyen, loke and countenance so grysely chaunged...that it was a terrible syght to beholde&quot;. There in the presence of the whole company, she was restored &quot;perfytely and sodeynly&quot;. Anne, in grateful recognition of the miracle, took the veil and became a nun.

==Destruction== 
The shrine was suppressed during the English Reformation, and its statue was taken to Chelsea to be burnt, along with the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham on 20 September 1538. There are no eyewitness accounts of the statue being burnt, although it is documented that the statue arrived at Chelsea. Regarding the image, Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s steward wrote to him that he had received it, with &#x27;nothing about her but two half shoes of silver&#x27;.

Although the shrine was destroyed, mention of it survived in legal deeds as a boundary description until the 18th century.

==The statue in Nettuno==
A wooden statue of the Madonna and Child displayed in the local church of the Italian seaside town of Nettuno matches various descriptions of the Ipswich statue. The statue is known locally as &quot;Our Lady of Grace&quot; or &quot;The English Lady&quot;. Radiocarbon dating places the era when the tree was felled to provide the wood of which the statue is carved at circa 1280 to 1420 with 94% certainty.

There is also evidence in the Nettuno archives that a statue arrived there from Ipswich in 1550. It was classified as being in the English iconic style in 1938 by Martin Gillett, an historian of 13th-century iconography. Although the statue had been altered (a throne had been replaced and the posture of the Christ child had changed), details such as the folds in the material and Christ&#x27;s position on the right rather than the left knee suggest that the statue came from England.

At the time of the Battle of Anzio during the Second World War, Nettuno&#x27;s statue was temporarily moved to Rome for safe keeping.

During restoration work on the statue in 1959 an inscription was found on its back with the words &quot;IU? ARET GRATIOSUS&quot;, a rendition of the Marian phrase, &quot;Thou art gracious&quot;. Ipswich was the only Marian shrine in England dedicated to Our Lady of Grace. Even more striking, when Martin Gillett first examined the statue in 1938, it was wearing two half shoes made of English silver, just like those described by Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s steward 400 years before.

There are two theories as to how the statue may have reached Italy. One theory is that it was sold by an English official (perhaps Thomas Cromwell) instead of being burnt. A second version of the story, popular in Nettuno, is that the statue was rescued by English sailors before it could be burnt, and smuggled on board a ship. In the Mediterranean they met a storm and took refuge in Nettuno and they donated the statue. A scientific analysis of a sliver of wood from the base of the statue has been found to have a high salt content – suggesting that it had at some point been in contact with seawater or sea spray.

As part of the Nettuno celebrations, thousands watch as the statue is taken down from high above the altar in the Basilica and, dressed in her finery, is taken in a grand procession through the streets for a week-long stay at the church of St Giovanni. A replica of the statue was presented to Pope Benedict XVI in Rome on 5 May 2010, during the week of the Shrine&#x27;s feast, beginning the first Sunday of May.

==Modern devotion==

A modern shrine is now in the Church of England parish church of St Mary at the Elms, a short distance away from the medieval location.

In 1987, the Guild of Our Lady of Ipswich was founded by people from the Catholic church of St Pancras and the Anglican church of St Mary at the Elms. Their aims have been: to pray for Christian unity and to plan and achieve the re-establishment of the shrine of Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich.

On 10 September 2002 a wooden replica of the Italian statue, carved by sculptor Robert Mellamphy, was blessed and installed by the Anglican Bishop of Richborough in the church of St Mary at the Elms. The ceremony was attended by the Anglican Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, the Roman Catholic Dean of Ipswich and representatives of the Eastern Orthodox and Methodist churches.

In 2022 the Catholic parish of St Pancras in Ipswich, commissioned the Stuflesser studio in northern Italy, to produce a replica of the statue in Nettuno. Carved from linden wood, the new statue stands 120cm tall and is seated on a throne. The Madonna wears a red gown and a blue cloak. On the cloak can be seen two golden stars and on the left sleeve of her cloak is a golden lily. Her right hand holds the Infant Child and in her left hand, the Madonna holds an untasted apple.

<doc id="951864" wikidata="Q6499462" url="?curid=951864" title="Laura Spencer (General Hospital)">
<text>Laura Spencer (also Collins) is a fictional character from &quot;General Hospital&quot;, an American soap opera on the ABC network. Laura, originally played by Stacey Baldwin, was introduced in 1974 as the illegitimate daughter of Lesley Webber (Denise Alexander). The character was written out in the summer of 1976. In early 1977, Genie Francis took over the role of the rebellious teenage Laura. In 1978, thanks to the efforts of executive producer Gloria Monty&#x27;s plan to entice younger viewers, the character&#x27;s popularity skyrocketed in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to her pairings with Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner) and, most famously, Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary); the latter became a popular supercouple among soap opera fans and viewers. Luke and Laura&#x27;s 1981 wedding – which featured a guest appearance from Elizabeth Taylorwas viewed by 30 million people. In 1981, Francis quit the show, claiming unequal treatment compared to Geary, and the character was written out as having disappeared the following January. Francis returned for a brief stint in late 1983 to reunite Luke and Laura, and then again in late 1984 when Laura was revealed to be pregnant.

In 1993, Laura was re-introduced by producer Wendy Riche, along with Luke and their young son Lucky Spencer (Jonathan Jackson). Their stories consisted of their struggle to hide from mobster Frank Smith, the 1994 birth of their daughter Lulu Spencer and the introduction of Laura&#x27;s illegitimate son Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher), who comes to town to save an ailing Lulu. Francis quit the series in 2002, and Laura was written out after suffering a psychotic breakdown, after believing to have killed her adoptive father Rick Webber (Chris Robinson). Francis returned in 2006 to celebrate Luke and Laura&#x27;s 25th wedding anniversary. The return stint, which only lasted a month, featured Laura&#x27;s reunions with her children, Nikolas, Lucky (Greg Vaughan), and Lulu (Julie Marie Berman), and Laura&#x27;s renewal of her wedding vows with Luke on their anniversary date. The return garnered Francis the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Francis returned to the series again in 2008 to help Lulu, who had also been institutionalized. In 2013, in honor of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration, Francis reprised the role of Laura when the writers revisited the iconic &quot;Ice Princess&quot; plot, and Laura was briefly remarried to Scott. Although initial reports said the actress would stick around, Francis left the role again that August. Francis returned to the series in 2015, this time as part of Luke&#x27;s exit storyline. Francis later signed a deal for her to remain with the series indefinitely.

==Storylines==

===1974–1984===

In 1974, Dr. Lesley Williams (Denise Alexander) is shocked to learn that one of her patients, Florence Grey (Anne Collings) is actually the wife of her former lover Professor Gordon Grey (Sherman Howard) who had fathered her deceased daughter. Gordon wants to be with Lesley, but she convinces him to stay with his wife and they eventually leave town. Lesley then marries the wealthy Cameron Faulkner (Don Matheson), only to learn from dying patient Doris Roach (Meg Wyllie), a former nurse at &quot;General Hospital&quot;, that her daughter is actually alive. Lesley&#x27;s father had paid Doris to switch Lesley&#x27;s healthy baby with the deceased child of Jason Vining (Richard Rust) and his wife Barbara (Judy Lewis). Jason, a teacher, struggles to make ends meet to take care of his family. Laura (Stacey Baldwin) hopes for a new typewriter for Christmas in 1975, but Barbara has to tell her &#x27;no&#x27; because they can&#x27;t afford it. Lesley&#x27;s determination to make contact with Laura puts a strain on her marriage. Lesley is overjoyed when she finally sees Laura for the first time at a candy store. Lesley follows her to a park and Laura is captivated when they meet. Lesley promises to buy Laura a new bike and a new typewriter, making Amy jealous and the Vinings uneasy. Lesley finally confesses that Laura is her daughter and Laura is thrilled. Lesley launches a custody suit and the judge postpones the final decision to allow Laura to get to know her biological mother first. Lesley receives temporary custody of Laura for 30 days. Though Laura enjoys her new life, she is not sure about making it permanent. At Laura&#x27;s request, the judge extends the trial period for another 30 days. Laura becomes ill and Lesley&#x27;s psychiatrist colleague, Dr. Peter Taylor (Craig Huebing), deems that it is due to emotional stress. Lesley makes the devastating choice to call off the custody suit and sends Laura back to live with the Vinings. In an attempt to keep Laura out of his life permanently, Cameron pays a nurse to claim that Laura was not Lesley&#x27;s daughter after all. Fortunately, Lesley knows this is a lie. In the summer of 1976, Cameron pays the Vinings to leave town with Laura for good.

In February 1977, Lesley tracks down a bitter Laura living in a commune in Canada. Laura mistakenly blames Lesley for abandoning her. Lesley tells Laura of Cameron&#x27;s schemes and convinces her to come home with her. The commune leader threatens them, however, forcing Lesley&#x27;s friend and love interest, Dr. Rick Webber (Michael Gregory), to rescue them. Laura falls for law student, Scott Baldwin, and is so distraught when he rejects her that she starts an affair with Rick&#x27;s friend, David Hamilton (Jerry Ayres). Laura accidentally causes David&#x27;s death when he rejects her for Lesley. Laura does not remember the incident and Lesley confesses to the murder. When Lesley is convicted, Laura confesses and is sentenced to probation. As her life spirals out of control, Scott and Laura reunite and become engaged on her 17th birthday. After they wed, Laura must get a job to help Scott pay for law school.

Laura ends up working for Luke Spencer at the campus disco. Luke is managing the campus disco for mobster Frank Smith, who orders Luke to kill a local senator. Luke declines to do so. As Laura tries to comfort a distressed Luke, he rapes her. Although Laura forgives him, the rape ignites a lifelong feud between Luke and Scott. Laura initially tries to avoid Luke, but they continue to end up together when they both start working at ELQ.

In 1979, Luke and Laura end up on the run and solve the mystery of the left-handed boy. The duo later teams up again to stop Mikkos Cassadine (John Colicos) from freezing the world. Now realizing how much they love each other, Laura divorces Scott in 1981 and marries Luke shortly after, while Mikkos&#x27;s widow, Helena (Elizabeth Taylor) puts a curse on the couple for her husband&#x27;s death. Laura&#x27;s friend, Tiffany Hill (Sharon Wyatt) gets Laura a modeling job as &quot;&quot;Ms. Star Eyes&quot;,&quot; but Laura suddenly disappears after being kidnapped by David Gray (Paul Rosilli) and presumed dead.

In 1983, it is revealed that Laura is being held by Mikkos and Helena&#x27;s son, Stavros (John Martinuzzi), who has convinced Laura that Luke is dead. Sick of her son&#x27;s obsession, Helena reveals that Luke is alive and allows Laura to escape. A confrontation with Luke ends with Stavros&#x27;s death. The couple attempted to settle into their roles in politics, but found the roles stifling. They decided to leave Port Charles that year in order to see the world.

In 1984, Robert helped Luke when he was accused of murder in Mexico so that Luke would be free to be with Laura. When Luke was finally cleared, he returned to Laura, who announced the joyous news that she was pregnant. The Spencers immediately shared their news with their friends. With the revelation, Luke and Laura made what seemingly would be their last appearance on General Hospital. In the following years, passing references to the couple would be made by several characters.

Later that year, Laura&#x27;s mother Lesley appears to die in a car accident (later revealed to be arranged by the Cassadine family).

===1993–2002===
The couple&#x27;s 1993 return coincides with the introduction of their son, Lucky (Jonathan Jackson). They are forced to abandon their diner in British Columbia to escape Frank Smith (Mitchell Ryan). Back in Port Charles, Laura is falsely accused of Damian Smith (Leigh McCloskey)&#x27;s murder. Fortunately she is acquitted when her lawyer, Justus Ward (Joseph C. Phillips) confesses. In 1996, Laura must bring her son, Nikolas (Tyler Christopher) to town to save an ailing Lulu. She is also reunited with Stefan (Stephen Nichols) which puts a strain on the marriage when Luke is falsely led to believe that Nikolas is Stefan&#x27;s son, and that Laura tried to reclaim him in 1984 which led to Lesley&#x27;s &quot;murder&quot; at the hands of Helena (Constance Towers); however, it is revealed that Helena faked Lesley&#x27;s death. Laura has a nervous breakdown when Lucky is &quot;killed&quot; in a fire and leaves town to recover. When Katherine Bell (Mary Beth Evans) is murdered, Laura is a suspect and Stefan confesses to protect her. While trying to clear her name, Laura discovers that Stefan knew Helena had faked Lucky&#x27;s death and she breaks up with him. Luke, Laura and Felicia Jones (Kristina Wagner) team up to find Lucky (Jacob Young) who has been brainwashed by Helena to hate his parents. Upset about Luke&#x27;s affair with Felicia, Laura borrows money from Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and buys &quot;Deception&quot; Cosmetics from Scott, as a way of asserting her independence pitting her against Luke&#x27;s niece, Carly Corinthos (Sarah Brown). Upon their divorce in June 2001, Laura reunites with Scott. Meanwhile, faces another hurdle when Helena resurrects Stavros (Robert Kelker-Kelly) who begins wreaking havoc on Port Charles. Laura helps Luke regain his memory after he is kidnapped by Helena and they admit their love for one another. Scott and Laura&#x27;s happiness is short lived and she reunites with Luke. The couple plans to remarry, but Laura suffers a nervous breakdown after uncovering repressed memories of killing Rick&#x27;s mistress, Theresa Carter (Alicia Arden) and she is led to believe that she killed Rick; Scott is forced to have Laura committed when she goes into a state of shock and reverts to her teenage self. Laura eventually falls into a catatonic state.

===2006–2013===
In 2006, a now teenage Lulu (Julie Marie Berman) visits Laura as she contemplates an abortion. In October 2006, Laura wakes up thanks to the efforts of Patrick Drake and Robin Scorpio (Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough) and shares a tearful reunion with Luke, Nikolas, Lucky (Greg Vaughan) and Lulu. Despite Luke&#x27;s recent marriage to heiress, Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot), everyone agrees to help Laura and Luke celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary with a ceremony. However, Laura&#x27;s condition quickly deteriorates and she is forced to return to Shadybrook. As she slips back into catatonia, Laura admits that she doesn&#x27;t believe she killed Rick. Nikolas, Scott and Luke continue to battle over what is best for Laura with Nikolas retaining sole guardianship. Lulu does some investigating and proves that Scott actually killed Rick.

In 2008, an institutionalized Lulu hallucinates Laura&#x27;s recovery when she must cope with her accidental murder of Logan Hayes (Josh Duhon), Scott&#x27;s son. When Laura&#x27;s doctors confirm that her condition has not changed, Nikolas and Lucky realize Lulu is getting worse. When Scott threatens to avenge Logan murder, Laura wakes up to defend her daughter. Scott tells Laura the truth about her last wedding to Luke and they run off to California. Luke, thinking they are eloping, follows where Scott and Laura end up in a car accident. Luke saves Laura when the car goes over a cliff and they end up at a wooded cabin where they discuss their relationship. Laura eventually goes to Paris, France to stay at the clinic that administers the LS-49 treatment. After telling Luke to move on, Laura boards a plane to France; unbeknownst to her, Scott is on the plane.

In February 2013, Laura reappears in Port Charles, and witnesses a close moment between Luke and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). She then surprises Lulu at The &quot;Haunted Star&quot; where she reveals that she met up with Lucky in Ireland. Laura also reconnects with Elizabeth and meets Lucky&#x27;s son, Aiden for the first time. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, Luke and Laura share a brief reunion. The past comes back to haunt them when Lulu and husband Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) reveal that someone sent Lulu a replica of the original Ice Princess diamond. Scott then arrives and reveals that he and Laura are back together. Their impending nuptials are derailed when Lulu is kidnapped by a very much alive Stavros Cassadine. Nikolas suddenly arrives with news of Lulu&#x27;s whereabouts and is immediately shot. They eventually end up on Cassadine Island where they confront Stavros.

===2015–present===
Two years pass when Laura shows up at the engagement party for Luke and Tracy and announces that her feelings for Luke are as strong as ever. After Luke and Laura talk privately, he announces that his engagement to Tracy is off. Secretly, Luke and Laura admit that they could never truly be together again, but because of a family crisis, they must pretend to be. It appears that Lucky has been kidnapped and when they arrive in Canada, they encounter Luke&#x27;s old fiancée, Jennifer Smith, who demands one night with Luke in exchange for Lucky. However, she doesn&#x27;t really have Lucky and because of the amount of wine both consumed, they don&#x27;t spend the night together. Next, they encounter a gun-wielding Holly Sutton who informs them that now Ethan is missing. The kidnappers send them a picture of a tied up and gagged Lucky and Ethan. Through the photo, Luke, Laura and Holly discover clues thanks to Lucky and Ethan and it leads them to their location. This leads them to another old enemy of Luke&#x27;s, the still very much alive Frank Smith, now paralyzed as a result of Luke&#x27;s gun battle with him 22 years before. Frank demands the life of Laura, knowing that this would leave the already emotionally fragile Luke a broken man. But at the last moment, Lucky storms in, and with a blast of gunfire, Frank Smith&#x27;s guards are dead. Luke pumps Frank full of lead, this time sending the aging mobster to his death for sure. Lucky informs them that he had to play along with Frank Smith to save his son Jake. When Luke and Laura discover that Helena wants to see Luke, Luke goes alone and learns a shocking truth, that their grandson Jake (whom Luke believed he had run over in his car while drunk) is very much alive. Meanwhile, Dillon Quartermaine (Robert Palmer Watkins) returns to Port Charles after having followed Luke and Laura, having discovered that Luke is still in love with Tracy and that his reconciliation with Laura was only to save their son. Luke later leaves Port Charles for good. Laura stays behind for a little while learning that her son, Nikolas, is hiding the truth about Jason Morgan being alive, and he is Jake Doe. Jason does not remember himself because he has amnesia once again after Ava Jerome ran him over with her car. Laura also learns that Nikolas hired a hit man to kill Hayden Barnes, but Hayden ended up in a coma. Laura, disappointed in her son, leaves town again.

Laura returns a few months later at the doorsteps of Patrick Drake. Laura is about to tell Patrick and Sam McCall that Jake Doe is really Jason Morgan, but she decides not to after she learns that Patrick and Sam are engaged. Laura then moves into Wyndemere. She is concerned for Nikolas, and she does not understand why he is involved with Hayden again, and why he let Hayden into his home. Nikolas wants to keep a close eye on Hayden, but he ends up falling in love with her. The truth about Jason eventually comes out. Laura&#x27;s daughter, Lulu, also found out that her husband, Dante, had a one stand with her cousin, Valerie Spencer, on the 4th of July when they were in Canada.

Laura&#x27;s longtime nemesis, Helena Cassadine, dies in November 2015 after Nikolas poisoned her with a cup of tea. Helena had Scotty Baldwin represent her last will and testimony, and Laura was surprised to find out that she was included in her will. The will was read in March 2016, and Helena gave Laura a &quot;key to something that she has loved and lost.&quot; The key opened to an old box in the Wyndemere attic, and Laura and Lulu found Scotty Baldwin&#x27;s old law school book.

==Creation==

===Casting===
Child actress Stacey Baldwin originated the role of Laura Vining in 1974. Baldwin last appeared as Laura in August 1976. Genie Francis filmed her first scenes on December 28, 1976, and made her onscreen debut on February 8, 1977. The daughter of veteran actor, Ivor Francis, Genie Francis was new to acting and had recently appeared on the ABC drama series, &quot;Family&quot; opposite Kristy McNichol. Four months later, the then 14-year-old Francis booked the role of Laura. Francis signed a three-year contract with the series and a later admitted that she felt a bit trapped. &quot;I signed away three years of my life. Never again&quot; she said. &quot;There was no light at the end of the tunnel.&quot; &quot;It was a very small part&quot; Francis said of the character when she initially booked the role of Laura. &quot;I was just Lesley&#x27;s long-lost daughter living in a commune&quot; Francis said. Francis auditioned for the role of Laura twice and beat out 40 other actresses for the part. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to shut her off&quot; Francis said of the character in 1979. &quot;I will get home and I find that my body is sore from tension, or I&#x27;m still about to cry.&quot;

In 1983, Francis reflected on her early years with the series in an interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;. Francis said, &quot;The first year was a tremendous learning process, but then I got hold of it and took it on my own.&quot; The actress said &quot;I was very nervous at the beginning, but when I learned to relax, I got better.&quot; She further explained her inexperience. &quot;I was a kid and had never been on a soundstage before. No one told me what to do. They handed me a script and said, &quot;Go!&quot; I was panicked—really hungry&quot; for instruction. She continued, &quot;So what I did was observe actors and do everything they did. Then I started asking questions.&quot; In her early years, Francis remembered being terrified of going to the studio alone and was accompanied by a nanny hired by her parents. Francis developed a &quot;close&quot; father-daughter like relationship with her onscreen father, Michael Gregory who took her under his wing. Meanwhile, Francis was initially intimidated by veteran actress Denise Alexander who played her onscreen mother but the two would become close friends. &quot;She really took me under her wing and when she saw me doing something wrong, she would tell me&quot; Francis said. By the end of her first stint at &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1982, Francis was reportedly making $150,000 a year.

Francis returned as Laura on October 29, 1993.

On May 29, 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that Francis would once again make a return to the series, beginning June 5. Francis revealed she would continue to appear on the series following Anthony Geary&#x27;s exit, which she was originally intended to be returning for. Francis promised she would continue to be seen through the fall sweeps period.

In October 2015, it was reported that Francis has inked a deal with the series and will remain in the role of Laura. In January 2018, Daytime Confidential reported that Francis has been demoted to recurring status. On July 31, 2018, TV Insider announced that Francis would be returning as a series regular.

===Characterization===
In 1979, the character was described by &quot;Soap Opera Digest&#x27;s&quot; Joanne Douglas as &quot;scheming, self-centered&quot; and &quot;frequently tormented.&quot; As a teen, Laura is very restless which often gets her into trouble. According to Douglas, Laura&#x27;s actions are her attempts to obtain her freedom from her parents. According to Francis, teen girls identified with the &quot;typically rebellious&quot; Laura. Mary Murphy of &quot;TV Guide&quot; described the character as a confused teenager, struggling &quot;to love and be loved.&quot; Murphy also described Laura as &quot;conniving, and often bittersweet.&quot; Francis described Laura as &quot;passive&quot; and said &quot;[She] was sweet for a long time.&quot; Francis stated that she appreciated how the writers transitioned Laura from being a girl to a young woman; as she gets older, Laura becomes a fighter and displays a lot of strength. Though Laura&#x27;s actions are not always noble, Francis explained that Laura&#x27;s intentions are always pure, and she does not intend to hurt anyone. However, Francis acknowledged the character&#x27;s growth and wisdom. Upon her character&#x27;s return in 1983, Francis said Laura is &quot;more sophisticated&quot; and &quot;more mature.&quot; After her 1993 return, Francis voiced her concerns that the character had become &quot;a little too good... a little too on high moral ground&quot; Francis explained. The actress continued &quot;What I loved about Laura the first time around was the she was so human. She always wanted to do the right thing, but sometimes she couldn&#x27;t. Lately, she&#x27;s been too much in control.&quot; She further stated, &quot;What I don&#x27;t like to play is this perfect person who is beyond human error.&quot;

==Development==

===Early storylines===
The character did not undergo any real character development until almost two years into Francis&#x27;s tenure as Laura. At the time, the series was facing cancellation and ABC brought on Gloria Monty as executive producer to save it. The new show runner&#x27;s first order of business was to attract younger viewers by putting the teenage Francis&#x27; Laura front and center. Francis reminisced about Monty&#x27;s conversation with her parents and her eagerness for more work in 1976. &quot;She told my parents, ‘My idea is to use your daughter to capture this young audience.’ I was absolutely champing at the bit to prove myself as an actress, so I welcomed the opportunity with a lot of gusto.&quot; Suddenly, Francis found herself with a very demanding work schedule in which she arrived on set at 7:30 am and sometimes did not finish work until midnight. The young actress also had study 30 to 50 pages of dialogue daily. Instead of 2 shows a week, Francis was onscreen every day. After Monty restructured the series around the character, Laura dreams of living independent from her parents and starts thinking about marriage. &quot;Gloria put sex and romance into Laura&#x27;s life and it bowled me over&quot; Francis said. &quot;Here I was doing things in front of 20 million people that I had never done in my own life.&quot; Some of the character&#x27;s earliest storylines include running away to a commune at age 15, Laura&#x27;s affair with David Hamilton (Jerry Ayres), who was in love with her mother Lesley. Only eight months after Monty&#x27;s hiring, she had Laura kill Hamilton. Though teenagers couldn&#x27;t relate to the murder itself, they could relate to the feelings of betrayal and Laura&#x27;s strained relationship with her mother. Francis credited the storyline with allowing her to prove herself as an actress. &quot;It was a romance with an older man.&quot; In a 1996 interview with &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot;, Francis said that the David Hamilton storyline &quot;really did drive the character and make her who she was.&quot; According to Francis, during the ordeal Laura is &quot;freaked out about looking good to the rest of the world because she was in the scandal sheets as a slut.&quot;

In the summer of 1977, Kin Shriner was cast in the role of Scott &quot;Scotty&quot; Baldwin to play opposite Francis&#x27;s Laura. Scotty and Laura would eventually be paired together in a romantic story. Francis said &quot;We did a first-love story with real-life sex, romance and heartbreak. ... It&#x27;s every teen-ager&#x27;s story.&quot; According to Shriner, &quot;Laura was the big love of Scotty&#x27;s life.&quot; Their end leaves Scotty &quot;jaded&quot; and screwed up. Scotty was Laura&#x27;s first kiss, and Shriner was Francis&#x27;s first kiss. Francis said, &quot;I&#x27;d been pecked before, but this was a real kiss!&quot; With a new love in her life, Laura inquires about birth control. &quot;It was the first time I was nervous&quot; Francis admitted. Laura and Scotty have a year long courtship which includes &quot;parental disapproval,&quot; Scotty supporting Laura during the David Hamilton murder trial, and the interference of Bobbie Spencer (Jacklyn Zeman) who wants Scott for herself. Finally, in July 1979, over the course of six episodes, Scotty and Laura are married. Francis and Shriner became quite close during their onscreen romance. Though Laura did love Scotty, their marriage also helps to &quot;improve her social standing&quot; and allows her to rise above her tragic past as a murderer. At some point, art imitated life and Francis and Shriner dated for nearly a year.

===Beginnings of Luke and Laura===
In 1978, Bobbie enlists her streetwise brother Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) to help her break up Scotty and Laura. Luke was expected to be a short term role as he &quot;was supposed to wreak havoc&quot; on the young couple on his sister&#x27;s behalf. The character was supposed to be killed off rather early, but Geary&#x27;s popularity gave the character a &quot;reprieve&quot; and Luke began falling for Laura. To satisfy viewers&#x27; hopes for an eventual Luke and Laura romance, the writers planned to have Luke die in Laura&#x27;s arms at the end of the arc and then reunite her with Scotty. In 1979 when Pat Falken Smith – known for her work on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; – took over as head writer of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Laura had just married Scotty and everyone was happy. &quot;And the thing to do was immediately get Laura unhappy&quot; Smith declared. Smith penned the controversial rape storyline in which a drunken Luke rapes Laura on the floor of the campus disco in October 1979. Francis characterized the incident as &quot;an acquaintance rape&quot; because it was &quot;by someone Laura knew and had been fascinated with.&quot;

In a 1983 interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, after Luke and Laura had been written to fall in love, Francis described the incident as a &quot;seduction rape.&quot; She continued echoing Pat Smith&#x27;s own words that &quot;It came to a point where it was beyond her control, and she couldn&#x27;t get away from it.&quot; Francis further explained that Laura stayed even though she &quot;felt the element of danger.&quot; The actress stated that &quot;Laura only called it rape because she wasn&#x27;t sure what really happened.&quot; Though Francis herself admittedly hated the idea, Laura was very much in love with Luke. To maintain excitement within the plot Gloria Monty borrowed ideas from old movies sending Luke and Laura on a cross-country summer adventure when they are on the run from the mob in 1980. Plans for the Luke/Laura/Scotty triangle to continue had to be scrapped when Kin Shriner left the show in 1980. In story, a dejected Scotty left town. The summer of 1981 featured the iconic Ice Princess diamond storyline in which Luke and Laura save the world from being frozen by the evil Mikkos Cassadine (John Colicos). Then head writer Thom Racina planned to hold off Luke and Laura&#x27;s wedding for another six months by having Scotty return. However, the producers were soon contacted by actress Elizabeth Taylor who was a fan of the show and had read about the storyline decision. Taylor agreed to make a guest appearance on the condition that Luke and Laura be married. As Luke and Laura marry on November 16, 1981, Taylor made a five episode guest appearance as Mikkos&#x27;s widow, Helena Cassadine cursing the couple for her husband&#x27;s demise.

===Departure and brief returns (1982–1984)===
In a 1992 interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, Genie Francis revealed that she initially considered leaving the role of Laura behind in 1979, as 17-year-old Francis longed for the chance finish to out her last year of high school and graduate with her friends. However, her agent convinced her to stick around and finally make some money off of playing such a popular character because she did not make much from her first contract. Francis agreed and re-signed with the series for another two years. In October 1980, Francis revealed during an interview with &quot;People&quot; that the thrill she got as a young actress early on in her career was no longer there. She also announced her intention to start college in 1981. In September 1981, Francis called a press conference to officially announce her departure from the series by the end of the year. With news of Francis&#x27; impending departure from &quot;General Hospital&quot;, it was reported that she had received other job offers from both ABC and CBS. While ABC offered Francis a role on &quot;Dynasty&quot;, CBS offered Francis a more lucrative contract for starring roles in films and the lead in a potential prime time drama. Francis concluded her nearly five-year run on January 15, 1982. The writers set up a &quot;mysterious disappearance&quot; for Laura with the network claiming it was due to Francis leaving for college. However, Francis claimed that she did not plan on attending school full-time. &quot;They never really gave me an exit&quot; Francis said of her departure. &quot;It was unfair to me and unfair to the fans.&quot; Within the story, Laura was simply a missing person. Francis filmed her final scenes &quot;as if it were any other day.&quot; Francis speculated that the network underestimated how serious she was about leaving the show because she felt limited. &quot;I would have stayed on if they had been a little more considerate of my time and allowed me to take other parts. It wasn&#x27;t a question of money – they were quite generous – I was just tired of the same old role.&quot; In a 1993 interview featured in &quot;People&quot; magazine, Francis said &quot;I was on the verge of having a total emotional breakdown&quot; from the pressure of it all. But in a 2006 interview with the Archive of American Television, Francis said her 1982 departure occurred because she was in the throes of a drug problem that lasted a year. After being hospitalized, during which Anthony Geary and Gloria Monty visited her, she quickly returned to the set. While in her dressing room, Francis was informed by a crewmember that Monty had said &quot;It didn&#x27;t matter if she lived or died because Tony Geary is the whole show.&quot; &quot;I left the show in that heartbeat,&quot; Francis said. &quot;I thought that if it doesn&#x27;t matter that I live or die, then I&#x27;m gone.&quot;

Francis herself suggested a storyline for her potential return that featured Laura&#x27;s onscreen death; however that never panned out. In October 1983, it was announced that Francis had agreed to a brief return stint to reunite the characters of Luke and Laura. Francis revealed that she was contacted by executive producer Gloria Monty to return for about 2 months. However, they eventually settled on about &quot;six weeks of air time.&quot; Of her character&#x27;s return in 1983, Francis said &quot;She&#x27;s been through a lot. She&#x27;s coming out of quite an ordeal.&quot; Francis praised Gloria Monty&#x27;s vision for Laura&#x27;s return and said the show runner had &quot;really surpassed herself with this story, so it will be easy for me to have a wonderful time doing it.&quot; During a televised interview, Francis revealed that Laura&#x27;s disappearance had to do with Helena Cassadine. Francis had several motivations for returning to the series. She explained &quot;I did this for fans. And I did it for myself. But I&#x27;m also doing it for Gloria Monty.&quot; However, Francis was not in the business of recapturing her former glory. &quot;We don&#x27;t need to... We&#x27;ve already done it&quot; the actress stated. &quot;I&#x27;m looking to satisfy my character&quot; Francis continued. &quot;Laura is different and the storyline is very different&quot; Francis explained. Francis returned to the series on November 14, 1983, and left on December 27, 1983. During an appearance on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; with Geary, Francis confirmed that her return would only be brief. Francis wrapped her storyline only a month later with her exit facilitating Geary&#x27;s. The storyline also featured Francis&#x27;s then boyfriend John Martinuzzi in the role of the evil Stavros Cassadine (initially a Cassadine cousin) who had forced Laura into marriage. Luke kills Stavros to rescue Laura. In an effort to boost ratings once again, ABC lured Francis and Geary back in 1984. The network spared no expense in flying several cast members, including Francis and Geary, to Cuernavaca, Mexico to film on location for six weeks. While Luke is on the run, it is revealed that Laura is pregnant. The story aired from October to December 1984, Francis aired from November 9 to December 10, 1984.

===Return and Laura&#x27;s pregnancy (1993–1994)===

Despite her claims that she was open to a return in 1992, when she was officially approached about a GH return in May 1992, Francis declined the offer. When they approached her again eight months later, Francis said &quot;I didn&#x27;t know whether to do it.&quot; After a long hesitation, her agent pushed her to make a decision. However, instead of contacting ABC to give them an answer, Francis would end up calling Geary himself because she was unsure if they could do it again. The duo met for lunch and then met again to brainstorm and did some &quot;improvisation&quot; to discover who Luke and Laura had become and what they would be about. &quot;I realized, miraculously, that the connection was still there&quot; Francis said. Geary who had actually returned to the series in 1991 in the role of Luke&#x27;s cousin Bill Eckert said &quot;Basically, I didn&#x27;t want to do Luke without Laura.&quot; In May 1993, during the 20th Daytime Emmy Awards, the official announcement was made; Francis would return and Geary would reprise the role of Luke. &quot;I felt it was time to go back&quot; Francis said. Francis further stated &quot;I really wanted to come back and finish it the right way.&quot; Executive producer Wendy Riche spoke with &quot;People&quot; magazine about the duo&#x27;s return. In addition to the introduction of Luke and Laura&#x27;s 10-year-old child, Riche said &quot;We want to focus on people who&#x27;ve got this great history. We want to see if they&#x27;ve grown or not.&quot; Riche later explained to &quot;TV Guide&quot; that &quot;None of us had any desire to duplicate the past—and we don&#x27;t need to... The chemistry between Tony and Genie is still magical, and the audience will still respond to the unconditional love between the characters because that kind of emotional bond is a rarity—in soaps and in life.&quot; Francis said of her eagerness to work opposite Geary again &quot;I have never, ever, had an acting partnership that was as safe, as full, and as exciting as the one I had with Tony. I didn&#x27;t want to go through life without having a chance to taste it again.&quot; Meanwhile, Geary echoed similar thoughts and said &quot;I had so closed the door on Luke that there was a point when I couldn&#x27;t even remember who he was. But when I sat down with Genie again, and looked at her and touched her and smelled her, it all came back. I can&#x27;t do it without her.&quot;

In August 1993, committed to making sure the couple&#x27;s return went off without a hitch, ABC fired the entire writing team and installed Emmy winning writer/producer who co-created &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; Claire Labine as head writer. Geary said &quot;I let out a deep breath and relaxed. I knew we&#x27;d be OK.&quot; Geary also developed the couples&#x27; return story with his writing partner Irene Suver. However, there was still &quot;trepidation&quot; not just from the actors, but also from the writers. Labine commented &quot;If we weren&#x27;t terrified, we&#x27;d be insane.&quot; Labine described the pairing as &quot;two old and dear friends whom we deeply loved but lost.&quot; However, the scribe said of their return &quot;Now they&#x27;re coming home again—and in that context it&#x27;s much less terrifying for us all.&quot; In addition to killing off the failed character of Bill, several popular characters including, Bill&#x27;s sister Jenny (Cheryl Richardson), her husband Paul Hornsby (Paul Satterfield), Kin Shriner&#x27;s Scotty, and Julia Barrett (Crystal Carson) were allegedly written out of the series to make way for the supercouple. The return also saw the introduction of Luke and Laura&#x27;s 10-year-old son Lucky (Jonathan Jackson). ABC spared no expense in setting up the couple&#x27;s usual grand entrance as the family appeared on October 29 in the midst of &quot;explosions, car chases, helicopters, parachutes, mobsters, catacombds, and a very deadly waterfall&quot; with several upstate New York location shoots.

In February 1994, Francis announced that she was pregnant with her first child. The pregnancy was written into the series and Laura is revealed to be pregnant with her second child. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; said &quot;It&#x27;s not often that an actress&#x27;s pregnancy works as beautifully into her storyline&quot; as Francis&#x27;s did. Much like when Laura&#x27;s early stories guided Francis through adolescence, Francis would learn about motherhood through her portrayal of Laura. She formed a close bond with her onscreen son Jonathan Jackson. &quot;It showed me that there is a part of me very ready to be a mother&quot; Francis said. In story, the pregnancy encourages Laura to appeal to Luke&#x27;s mob friend Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) about keeping Luke and their family safe from Frank Smith (Mitchell Ryan) whom is about to break out of prison—with Sonny and Luke&#x27;s help of course. If the couple&#x27;s desire to get out from under Smith&#x27;s constant threats weren&#x27;t evident before, they are obvious and crucial when Laura learns she is pregnant. As Laura gives birth to daughter Lesley Lu on August 8, 1994, Francis took a six-week maternity leave to give birth to her own son on August 20. In story, Laura and Lesley Lu leave town to keep them safe from Luke&#x27;s mob connections.

===Murder of Damian Smith (1996)===
After about two years in &quot;storyline abyss&quot; Francis was thrust back into the limelight when Laura becomes the prime suspect in a &quot;Whodunit&quot; murder mystery in 1996. The outcome of the story was a very huge guarded secret. &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot; reported that &quot;ABC has so much invested in this whodunit that the show is reportedly secretly taping 20 scenes to be inserted in shows at the last minute so that neither the actors nor the crew can leak pivotal plot information to the press.&quot; When the evil mob prince Damian Smith (Leigh McCloskey) is murdered in March 1996, suspicion immediately falls on the unusually innocent Luke. However, everyone is stunned in April 1996 when Laura is suddenly arrested instead. Luke is willing to do just about anything to keep Laura out of trouble, including a prison break and going on the run. While they had done it before, living on the run would be much more complicated with two children. Though Laura at the time is trapped inside a burning building with foster children—a fire set by Damian himself—the timing and location of his murder makes her look awfully guilty. Head writer Bob Guza said &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter whether or not she did it, but whether they can prove she did. It very much appears they can.&quot; Despite having the best attorney money can buy thanks to the wealthy Edward Quartermaine (John Ingle), Laura is indicted and sent to prison. Luke hires a new attorney in Edward&#x27;s grandson Justus Ward (Joseph C. Phillips) and private investigator Mac Scorpio (John J. York) to help identify the real culprit. The &quot;umbrella&quot; story &quot;encompasses many stories on the soap&quot; and threatens Luke and Laura&#x27;s relationship along with others. Laura&#x27;s past with David Hamilton factors in when she realizes she could have killed Damian and repressed the memory like she did with David. Francis hoped that was the case. &quot;She&#x27;s lost it before. And that&#x27;s okay with me.&quot; Laura is still in prison just in time for Mother&#x27;s Day leaving the entire Spencer family in shambles. &quot;We play very big emotional stuff with the kids&quot; Guza stated. &quot;Does Laura want them to see her in jail? Does she want Lesley Lu to remember her like this?&quot; Meanwhile, Lucky feels extreme guilt because in his attempt to clear Luke&#x27;s name, he unintentionally puts suspicion on Laura. It is eventually revealed that Laura&#x27;s defense attorney, Justus Ward had killed Smith.

===The Cassadines&#x27; return (1996–1999)===
Just as quickly as Laura gets cleared of murder charges, Lesley Lu (Lulu) suddenly becomes gravely ill. While Laura had seemed to become quite the &quot;paitron saint,&quot; Francis subtly revealed &quot;cracks in Laura&#x27;s stalwart surface&quot; when her daughter&#x27;s life is hanging in the balance. Francis wowed viewers and critics as Laura suffers through the ordeal feeling helpless. However, &quot;[she] must keep it together – asking questions, filling out paperwork, comforting her daughter.&quot; However, &quot;Laura&#x27;s world has been shattered.&quot; Laura&#x27;s desperation facilitates the reintroduction of the Cassadine family who become quite the threat to Luke and Laura&#x27;s family. Laura contacts Stavros&#x27;s brother Stefan Cassadine (Stephen Nichols) for help. Stefan sends his nephew Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) to donate his bone marrow to save Lulu and Laura is forced to admit that Nikolas is actually her son with Stavros conceived during her time in captivity. It is soon revealed that Laura and Stefan had a love affair during her captivity. &quot;At one time, she genuinely loved him because she thought Luke was dead&quot; Francis said of Laura&#x27;s &quot;underlying&quot; feelings for Stefan. As Luke and Laura prepare to celebrate their anniversary, the writers explore Stefan and Laura&#x27;s romance through a series of flashbacks. A bitter feud erupts with, not only between Luke and Stefan, but also between Nikolas and Lucky with Laura in the middle. At one point, Luke plans drugs on Nikolas. Stefan has no qualms about putting Lucky in harms way to avenge Nikolas. According to Francis, &quot;in Laura&#x27;s fantasy world, she would stay married to Luke, he would accept [Nikolas],&quot; the brothers would get along and &quot;Stefan would drop by the house for dinner.&quot; Geary said the Cassadines bring a much needed conflict to the duo. Though Luke and Laura seem unshakable, &quot;this is doing it&quot; Geary said.

==Reception==
In 2023, Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed Laura first place on his ranked list of &quot;General Hospital’s 40+ Greatest Characters of All Time&quot;, commenting &quot;Reunited with her birth mother? Check. Crushed on Mom’s man? Check. Abducted to a Greek isle? Check. Played dead? Nervous breakdown? Elected mayor? Check, check and also check. If it could happen to a soap-opera heroine, it happened to Genie Francis’ erstwhile Miss Star Eyes, along the way making her not just beloved but iconic.&quot;

In December 2024, Francis&#x27; work opposite Elliot, was named by &quot;TV Insider&quot; as their fourth best performance, in ranking their &quot;21 Best Soap Performances of 2024&quot;. In the article, editor Michael Maloney wrote: &quot;We saw Laura make the decision to follow Tracy into the hallway at General Hospital after she visited a comatose Lulu. Both women cautiously assessed how the other might be feeling. Tracy didn&#x27;t want to infringe on Laura&#x27;s time with her daughter. A vulnerable Laura wanted to reach out to Tracy, who&#x27;s not always known for her ability to connect emotionally. In a quiet, &quot;small&quot; scene, which soaps are famous for, Laura thanked Tracy for being there for her daughter when she couldn&#x27;t be.&quot;

<text>Thomas Smith (1615 – 12 April 1702) was an English clergyman, who served as Dean of Carlisle, 1672–1684, and Bishop of Carlisle, 1684–1702. He graduated MA from The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1639 and served as chaplain to King Charles II.

==Life==
The son of John Smith of Whitewell in the parish of Asby, Cumberland, after education at the free school at Appleby, he matriculated from Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, on 4 November 1631, aged 16. Having graduated B.A. in 1635 and M.A. in 1639, he became a fellow of his college and a tutor.

He was a select preacher before Charles I at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1645. When that city fell he retired to the north of England, where he married Catharine (née Dalston), widow of Sir Henry Fletcher of Hutton, in Cumberland, and only emerged on the Restoration, proceeding B.D. on 2 August 1660, and D.D. by diploma in the following November. He was appointed chaplain to Charles II, and was rewarded with the first prebendal stall in Carlisle Cathedral (November 1660). Within a few months of this he was collated to a prebend in the Durham Cathedral, the prebendal house attached to which he restored. On the promotion of Guy Carleton to the see of Bristol, Smith was instituted dean of Carlisle (4 March 1671–2). After the death of his wife Catherine on 16 April 1676 he married Anne Wrench, née Baddeley (sometime after 4 November 1676). He succeeded Edward Rainbowe as bishop in 1684 (consecrated 19 June), and died at Rose Castle on 12 April 1702. He was succeeded at Carlisle by another fellow of Queen&#x27;s, William Nicolson.

==Legacy==
A flat stone near the altar in the cathedral is inscribed to his memory. A number of his letters are calendared among the Rydal MSS.

As Dean, he rebuilt the deanery and presented the cathedral with an organ. With his first cousin, Thomas Barlow, bishop of Lincoln, and Randall Sanderson, he gave £600 for the improvement of Appleby Grammar School. He endowed Carlisle Grammar School, the chapter library, and the cathedral treasury, as well as donations to his old college at Oxford and to the poor.

<text>AutoWorld was an indoor theme park in Flint, Michigan, United States, developed as a tourist attraction for its host city. It opened as Six Flags AutoWorld on July 4, 1984, and closed for the first time just six months later, closing permanently in 1994 before its demolition three years later.

On the grand opening of AutoWorld, then-Governor James J. Blanchard said it would trigger &quot;the rebirth of the great city of Flint.&quot;

== Origins ==

The idea for AutoWorld originated as early as 1969, when Joseph Anderson, retired manager of AC Spark Plug, &quot;recalled that Harding Mott, president of the Mott Foundation was angry because of a news story from California about students burying a Chevrolet to emphasize their antagonism towards cars&quot; and wanted to show the importance of the automobile to society. However, former mayor of Flint, James W. Rutherford, attributes the idea for AutoWorld to Anderson. A second possible origin for the idea of AutoWorld is Harding Mott discussing the need for the Flint community &quot;to get its pride together&quot; because &quot;after all, [Flint is] one of the main centers in the history of automaking.&quot;

==Planning==
AutoWorld was one element of Flint&#x27;s overall downtown redevelopment plan in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially, the idea was to build a hall of fame for the automobile in Flint. On April 2, 1970, civic leaders from Flint met at the Consumers Power Co. lodge at Tippy Dam on the Big Manistee River to discuss the redevelopment of the central city of Flint. This meeting led to the establishment of the Flint Area Conference, Inc. (FACI), a non-profit corporation with the stated purpose &quot;of an organization of civic and business leaders working with public officials in an effort to meet unfilled physical and economic needs of the community.&quot;

After the meeting at Tippy Dam, a committee headed by Anderson was founded to study the idea for an automotive hall of fame. The committee commissioned Yamasaki and Associates of Troy, Michigan, to produce a plan for the hall of fame to be built on an island in the Flint River, which was the first plan for AutoWorld.
Over the next decade, between 1970 and 1980, several other plans and designs were commissioned, playing roles of varying importance to the development of AutoWorld. In 1978, C. W. Shaver &amp; Company, Inc., developed a plan to create &quot;a National Institute to demonstrate the impact of the automobile&quot; and &quot;a people-attraction in downtown Flint centered around the automobile.&quot; The project was called &quot;A National Institute of Automotive Science and History (AutoWorld).&quot;

In 1980, the C. S. Mott Foundation and the FACI received a market support update from Hammer, Siler, George Associates, which included updated projections based on their initial study of 1976. This updated plan &quot;retains an automotive theme but incorporates many theme park elements&quot; and states, &quot;AutoWorld will contain several rides and shows as well as highly participatory displays and a wide variety of retail and restaurant outlets.&quot; AutoWorld was to contain elements of a theme park but on a smaller scale, indoors, and with more attractions for visitors of all ages. This plan included attendance projections and predicted that residents of Flint would comprise the majority of AutoWorld attendees based on projections from other similar theme parks.

The final plan for AutoWorld came from Randall Duell Associates, and Recreation Consultants of Santa Clara, headed by David L. Brown, completed a Feasibility Study of AutoWorld for FACI. The plan revealed that projected attendance for the first year would be 750,000 and approximately 1 million for the next year.

===Financial support===

The project received financial support from various private and public sources, including $11 million from the Mott Foundation, $36.5 million in public funds, $4 million from local donors, $9 million from Capital Income Properties, and $1 million from GM.

==Operation==
After fifteen years of planning, AutoWorld opened on July 4, 1984, with great fanfare, including a parade. For $8.95 a ticket, visitors could enter what was promoted as &quot;the largest enclosed theme park in the world.&quot;

During the first month of operation, AutoWorld hit its turnstile target: From July 4 to August 4, 1984, 139,970 people visited the park. Most experts predicted that AutoWorld would draw one million visitors per year; however, it soon became clear that these figures were overestimated. By the fall of 1984, attendance had already begun to decrease. Although business increased on holidays and weekends, during the week, the attraction was mostly empty. When it became clear that AutoWorld would not reach its attendance target, financiers moved to close the park down.

===Attractions===
Inside AutoWorld&#x27;s dome, there were a variety of attractions, including a replica of historic downtown Flint, designed to depict Saginaw Street as it appeared in 1900. This simulation included a flowing river, comfortable benches, and &quot;$500,000 worth of tropical plants and trees.&quot;

The first display that visitors encountered was a small cabin, inside of which was a mannequin designed to look like Jacob Smith, the founder of Flint. Pushing a red button on the outside of the cabin started a film that was projected onto the mannequin&#x27;s face. The mannequin/film would welcome the visitor to AutoWorld and talk about the beginning of Flint. Other attractions included a ferris wheel and a carousel, a carnival ride through &quot;The Humorous History of Automobility,&quot; and several shops and restaurants.

Inside section housed in the Industrial Mutual Association (IMA) Auditorium, there was a giant automobile engine, a wall with a rotating display of old brand shields, and an attraction depicting the past, present, and future of automobile assembly, including a mock assembly line operated by robots. AutoWorld also had an IMAX theater and a two-story ramp that exhibited a history of the effect of automobiles in popular culture.

One attraction, a film entitled &quot;The Car of Your Dreams,&quot; produced by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, celebrated three decades of automobile mobile industry advertisements, from the early days of television advertising and into the 1980s. The short film, which continues to be in distribution for educational purposes, exemplifies how the automotive industry has long been a master of creating and manipulating images of desirable lifestyles to sell a product.

==Closure==
In December 1984, AutoWorld announced it would only be open on weekends throughout the rest of the winter. In January 1985, investors closed AutoWorld completely. Initially, there were efforts to keep AutoWorld in operation. There were efforts, planned for May 1987, to open AutoWorld with &quot;weekend only operation with seasonal operation as a theme park and festival center.&quot;

Although AutoWorld would open for several brief periods throughout the following years, Michigan&#x27;s depressed economy continued to scare away tourists and investors.{cn} AutoWorld closed permanently in 1994. After the closure, there were several proposals for redevelopment, including a casino, but that plan was rejected in 1994. The Flint Downtown Development Authority (DDA) gave the land to the University of Michigan-Flint, and the park was demolished in early 1997.
The land is currently home to the University of Michigan-Flint&#x27;s William S. White Building, which houses the nursing program and College of Health Sciences.

==References in popular culture==
AutoWorld was featured in the 1989 Michael Moore film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;. Footage of AutoWorld being demolished was shown in Moore&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;The Big One&quot;.

<doc id="951871" wikidata="Q5312989" url="?curid=951871" title="Duke of Châtellerault">
<text>Duke of Châtellerault () is a French noble title that has been created several times, originally in the Peerage of France in 1515. It takes its name from Châtellerault, in the Vienne region.

The first title was created for François de Bourbon-Montpensier, a younger son of Gilbert, Comte de Montpensier, who was created Viscount of Châtellerault (&quot;Vicomte de Châtellerault&quot;) in February 1514. He received the duchy-peerage of Châtellerault in 1515, but was killed the same year, being succeeded by his brother Charles, &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Duke of Bourbon and Auvergne. This title was confiscated in 1527 after the Duke, who was Constable of France, betrayed the King by allying himself with the Emperor Charles V.

The duchies of Châtellerault and Bourbon were then conferred on Louise of Savoy, the mother of King Francis I, but the latter title became extinct in 1530 when she ceded the territory of the duchy to Louis de Bourbon, Prince de la Roche-sur-Yon and later also Duc de Montpensier. However, the dukedom was again conferred on Louise of Savoy that year, and she retained it until her death in 1532.

The dukedom was next created for Louise&#x27;s grandson Charles, son of King Francis I, who was created Duke of Orléans, Duke of Châtellerault and Duke of Angoulême in 1544. He died unmarried in 1545, when these titles became extinct.

The next creation of the dukedom was in 1548, for James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, and Regent of Scotland, who arranged the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Dauphin Francis, son of King Henry II, and who had been promised a duchy by the Treaty of Châtillon, 1548. However, he turned against the Queen in 1559, and his French estates and title were confiscated.

The next recipient of the dukedom was Diane de France, legitimated daughter of Henry II and Filippa Duci, in 1563. However, she exchanged Châtellerault for the duchy of Angoulême in 1582.

The next year, the dukedom was given to François, Duke of Montpensier, son of Louis above-mentioned, in 1584. His granddaughter Marie, Duchesse de Montpensier, in 1626 married Gaston, Duke of Orléans, son of King Henry IV, and their daughter Anne-Marie-Louise, &quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot;, inherited the dukedoms of Montpensier and Châtellerault. She died in 1693, when the titles became extinct, and left the territory of the dukedom to her paternal first cousin Philip I, Duke of Orléans, son of King Louis XIII.

In the 1720s, he sold the lands to Frédéric Guillaume de la Trémoille, Prince de Talmont, whose son Anne-Charles-Frédéric was created Duke of Châtellerault in 1730. He succeeded his father as Prince de Talmont in 1738 and died without issue in 1759, when the dukedom became extinct, and the lands passed to another branch of the La Trémoille family.

That was the last legally defined creation of the dukedom, but in 1864, the Hamilton creation of 1548 was revived by the Emperor Napoleon III. However, this revival was neither in favour of the heir under the original letters patent, the 14th Earl of Derby, nor in favour of the heir-male, the 2nd Marquess of Abercorn, but rather in favour of the 12th Duke of Hamilton, who was a third cousin once removed of the Emperor through his mother the former Princess Marie Elisabeth of Baden. He died without male issue in 1895, and was succeeded as Duke of Hamilton by his fourth cousin Alfred, Duke of Hamilton. The Dukes of Hamilton and the Dukes of Abercorn have since then used the title in France, though without any legal justification.

<text>Sihui (), formerly romanized as Szewui, is a county-level city in the west of the Pearl River Delta region in Guangdong province, China. It is administered as part of the prefecture-level city of Zhaoqing. Sihui&#x27;s population is 640,910 in 2020.

==History==
Sihui was initially established during the Qin dynasty (221 BC—207 BC), some historians suggested Sihui first appeared during the Western Han dynasty (206 BC—8 AD), and it is one of the four most ancient counties in Guangdong province (the other three counties are Panyu county, Jieyang county and Longchuan county). 
Under the Qing, SihuiCounty made up part of the commandery of Zhaoqing. As with much of the surrounding countryside, Sihui was a source for many members of the Chinese diaspora during the late Qing.

<text>Ginkgolides are biologically active terpenic lactones present in &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;. They are diterpenoids with 20-carbon skeletons, which are biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.

==Examples==

===Ginkgolide B===
Ginkgolide B, specifically, is a diterpenoid trilactone with six five-membered rings. It contains a spiro[4,4]-nonane carbocyclic ring, a tetrahydrofuran ring, and a very specific tert-butyl group at one of the rings (Figure 1).
The class of ginkgolides was first isolated from the tree &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; in 1932. Structural elucidation was accomplished in 1967 by Maruyama &quot;et al&quot;.

==Background==
It is extracted from the root bark and leaves of the &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; (&quot;&quot; meaning &quot;silver apricot&quot;) tree found native in China. It is marketed to other countries that include Korea, France, the United States, etc. for the drug and clinical properties of the extracts. Present in the tree is less than 0.1 to 0.25% of ginkgolide B, the most abundant being ginkgolide A.

==Potential applications==
This class of molecules has been studied for its potential to act as a platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist.

Ginkgolide B has been investigated for its potential to reducing migraine frequency.

Ginkgolide B is also used in treatment for cerebrovascular disease. Research has also proven that ginkgolide B can also treat migraines in young ages. The literature indicates that ginkgolide B functions as a selective antagonist of glycine receptors based on noncompetitive inhibition for the neurological system that this compound performs.

==Spectroscopic studies for the elucidation of the individual structures for the ginkgolides==

Ginkolides A - C were isolated from a large scale methanolic extraction followed by liquid-liquid partitions, column chromatography and repeated crystallizations. The molecular formulas were determined by high resolution mass spectrometry, and the overall structures by IR and NMR spectroscopic analysis and extensive derivitization techniques.

==Biosynthesis of ginkgolide B==

While researchers have published chemical pathways to make this molecule, most of the designed syntheses were too complex and produced little of the actual material to run full analyses. Therefore, studying the biosynthesis of the molecule is preferable.

Most of the natural product terpenoids start with isopentenyl diphosphate synthesized by the MEP pathway. This pathway also generates dimethylallyl diphosphate, from pyruvate and D-glyercaldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). When coupled together, they form one molecule of geranylgeranyl diphosphate with geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase.

A molecule of GGPP generates (1) (+)-copalyl in the presence of levopimaradiene synthase. (a) Then (1) loses its OPP group catalyzed by this same synthase, performing an intramolecular allylic cyclization with the two alkenes, to form (2) the sandaracopimarenyl cation. (b) This cation then undergoes an internal cyclization to stabilize the carbocation in the ring by proton transfer to form (3) intermediate.
(c) By doing this, the molecule sets itself up for a methyl migration to stabilize that secondary cation and generate that tertiary carbocation at (4). (d) This induces a loss of proton to get (5) levopimaradiene. (e) With oxidation, a loss of a proton to form an aromatic ring generates (6) abietatriene. (g) This newly formed abietatriene undergoes a 1,2-alkyl shift to break the 6-membered ring into (7) with a five-membered ring (more favorable). (h) Another 1,2-alkyl shift takes place at the same time a ring cleavage takes place to generate (8). (i) Oxidation at all the positions with alkenes generates (9) intermediate which then undergoes ring closures featuring one hemiacetal and all three lactones to get ginkgolide B at (10).

<text>Xizhimen () was a gate in the Beijing city wall and is now a transportation node in Beijing. The gate was the entrance of drinking water for the Emperor, coming from the Jade Spring Hills to the west of Beijing. The gate was demolished in 1969.

== Transportation ==
The 2nd Ring Road links with Xizhimen Outer Street, which has recently been transformed into a city express road, linking the western 2nd Ring Road via Beijing Zoo to the 3rd Ring Road. A triple-arched highrise building is a noticeable landmark at the intersection.

The Beijing North railway station is in the Xizhimen area.

Line 2, Line 4 and Line 13 of the Beijing Subway network all stop at Xizhimen Station. A transfer passage with escalators allows for direct transfers between the three Lines. Line 13 has its western terminus at Xizhimen.

Xizhimen is served by many Beijing public buses. Bus routes 16, 360, 362, 275, 438, 534, 563, 632, 651, 特15, and 夜21 all have terminals in the Xizhemen area.

A bridge is named after the region (Xizhimen Bridge). The bridge has a northern connection bridge built in the late 1970s. It will be removed and be replaced soon. The main Xizhimen Bridge, built also in the 1970s, once stood a rather frightening 5.5 m (it was then, and still is now, for the record, the tallest bridge on the 2nd Ring Road) and had three layers, with the top layer acting as a roundabout. Demolition of the old central bridge took place in 1999 by means of structural removal instead of a major bridge explosion. It was replaced with a series of new bridges which bear no resemblance to the old bridge.

== Xihuan Plaza and Xizhimen Project ==
In 2008 due to the Olympic Games, a reform in Xizhimen Transportation hub, was finished, a masterplan willing to integrate the new Xizhimen, Offices and Commercial building, with the Xihuan Plaza, and both train and subway station. Several Chinese and International Companies took part on the design and construction of the plan. In Xihuan Plaza &amp; Xizhimen Transportation Hub, Li Xinggang, as the chief designer, presided the engineering design and particular work. The constructions were inaugurated just in time for the Olympic Games.

<text>Frederick Neuhouser (born 1957) is the Viola Manderfeld Professor of German and a professor of Philosophy at Barnard College, Columbia University. He is a specialist in European philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, especially Rousseau, Fichte, and Hegel.

==Education and career==
Neuhouser graduated from Wabash College (Crawfordsville, IN), &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, 1979, and received his Ph.D. from Columbia University. Before returning to the Barnard/Columbia faculty, Neuhouser taught at Harvard University, University of California, San Diego, Cornell University and Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences in 2021.

==Philosophical work==
Neuhouser&#x27;s focus is on German Idealism and continental social theory. He has published four books: &quot;Fichte&#x27;s Theory of Subjectivity&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1990); &quot;Foundations of Hegel&#x27;s Social Theory: Actualizing Freedom&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2000), which argues for the centrality of &quot;social freedom&quot; in Hegel&#x27;s political thought; &quot;Rousseau&#x27;s Theodicy of Self-Love: Evil, Rationality, and the Drive for Recognition&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2008); and &quot;Rousseau&#x27;s Critique of Inequality: Reconstructing the Second Discourse&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2014).

His latest work &quot;Diagnosing Social Pathology: Rousseau, Hegel, Marx and Durkheim&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2023) is centered on ideas of &quot;social pathology&quot; in 18th, 19th and 20th-century philosophy.

<text>The Royal College of Science Union (RCSU) is a student union and science outreach organisation at Imperial College London which represents over 3,000 students in the university&#x27;s Faculty of Natural Sciences. It manages the student societies for the departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Biology. The RCSU runs Science Challenge, a national science communication competition, and publishes the Broadsheet science magazine.

== History ==
The RCSU was founded in 1881, following the creation of the Royal College of Science in the same year. The RCS was established to support training of the non-Earth Sciences within the Royal School of Mines which had been founded in 1853 following the merger of the Royal College of Chemistry with the Government School of Mines and Science Applied to the Arts in 1853.

The RCSU was briefly disbanded for a few years in the early 2000s following the College&#x27;s decision to split up the Sciences Faculty into separate Faculties of Physical and Life Sciences, with the RCSU at the time deciding to follow suit, splitting into the Physical Sciences Union and the Life Sciences Union. In 2006 however, following the College&#x27;s decision to re-merge the faculties, the presidents of the two constituent unions, Kilian Frensch and Mariko Tavernier, proposed to re-merge the two student unions, with the new union named the &quot;Royal College of Science Union&quot; following a popular vote. The re-merged RCSU was first led jointly by Kilian Frensch and Mariko Tavernier for the remainder of the college year, before Jad Marrouche became its first sole president the following year.

== Science Challenge ==
The RCSU Science Challenge is a scientific writing competition created in 2006 by the presidents of the newly-reformed RCSU. Initially only for students of Imperial College, from its second year it was expanded and made open to schools students from across the country. The competition invites notable science communicators to judge the entries, with recent judges including BBC News science correspondent Pallab Ghosh, physicist John Pendry and climatologist Brian Hoskins.

== Traditions ==
The RCSU has a number of traditions, including the chanting of the kangela at bar nights and the sport of mascotry, guarding a college mascot called &quot;Theta&quot;. Theta takes the form of a thermometer, chosen as an instrument used by all scientific disciplines. Theta has had a number of incarnations, with the current mascot, Theta Mk.IV being a seven-foot steel thermometer weighing over 100 pounds (45 kg).

The RCSU also keeps an &#x27;inviolate mascot&#x27; (i.e. it cannot be stolen), which is a Dennis N-Type fire engine known as Jezebel. Built in 1916, &#x27;Jez&#x27; was donated to the college in 1955 when she finished her working life, and is equipped with 9-litre engine capable of pumping around 500 gallons of water per minute. There is a dedicated RCS Motor Club which maintains and takes care of Jezebel. She is involved with charity work and appears at various motor shows.

== Kangela ==

The Kangela is reputed to be an ancient Swahili Fertility Chant [Royal College of Science Handbook, 1973] first adopted by the RCSU in the middle 1950s as a War Cry on the occasion of Morphy Day.

The words are as follows:

The word &quot;kangela&quot; means &quot;to watch&quot; in Zulu.

<doc id="951901" wikidata="Q837995" url="?curid=951901" title="Rood screen">
<text>The rood screen (also choir screen, chancel screen, or jubé) is a common feature in late medieval church architecture. It is typically an ornate partition between the chancel and nave, of more or less open tracery constructed of wood, stone, or wrought iron. The rood screen was originally surmounted by a rood loft carrying the Great Rood, a sculptural representation of the Crucifixion. In English, Scottish, and Welsh cathedrals, monastic, and collegiate churches, there were commonly two transverse screens, with a rood screen or rood beam located one bay west of the pulpitum screen, but this double arrangement nowhere survives complete, and accordingly the preserved pulpitum in such churches is sometimes referred to as a rood screen. At Wells Cathedral the medieval arrangement was restored in the 20th century, with the medieval strainer arch supporting a rood, placed in front of the pulpitum and organ.

Rood screens can be found in churches in many parts of Europe; however, in Catholic countries they were generally removed during the Counter-Reformation, when the retention of any visual barrier between the laity and the high altar was widely seen as inconsistent with the decrees of the Council of Trent. Accordingly, rood screens now survive in much greater numbers in Anglican and Lutheran churches; with the greatest number of survivals complete with screen and rood figures in Scandinavia. The iconostasis in Eastern Christian churches is a visually similar barrier, but is now generally considered to have a different origin, deriving from the ancient altar screen or templon.

==Description and origin of the name==

The word &quot;rood&quot; is derived from the Saxon word &quot;rood&quot; or &quot;rode&quot;, meaning &quot;cross&quot;. The rood screen is so called because it was surmounted by the Rood itself, a large figure of the crucified Christ. Commonly, to either side of the Rood, there stood supporting statues of saints, normally Mary and St John, in an arrangement comparable to the Deesis always found in the centre of an Orthodox iconostasis (which uses John the Baptist instead of the Apostle, and a Pantokrator instead of a Crucifixion). Latterly in England and Wales the Rood tended to rise above a narrow loft (called the &quot;rood loft&quot;), which could occasionally be substantial enough to be used as a singing gallery (and might even contain an altar); but whose main purpose was to hold candles to light the rood itself. The panels and uprights of the screen did not support the loft, which instead rested on a substantial transverse beam called the &quot;rood beam&quot; or &quot;candle beam&quot;. Access was via a narrow rood stair set into the piers supporting the chancel arch. In parish churches, the space between the rood beam and the chancel arch was commonly filled by a boarded or lath and plaster tympanum, set immediately behind the rood figures and painted with a representation of the Last Judgement. The roof panels of the first bay of the nave were commonly richly decorated to form a celure or canopy of honour; or otherwise there might be a separate celure canopy attached to the front of the chancel arch.

The carving or construction of the rood screen often included latticework, which makes it possible to see through the screen partially from the nave into the chancel. The term &quot;chancel&quot; itself derives from the Latin word &quot;cancelli&quot; meaning &quot;lattice&quot;; a term which had long been applied to the low metalwork or stone screens that delineate the choir enclosure in early medieval Italian cathedrals and major churches. The passage through the rood screen was fitted with doors, which were kept locked except during services.

The terms &quot;pulpitum&quot;, &quot;Lettner&quot;, &quot;jubé&quot; and &quot;doksaal&quot; all suggest a screen platform used for readings from scripture, and there is plentiful documentary evidence for this practice in major churches in Europe in the 16th century. From this it was concluded by Victorian liturgists that the specification &quot;ad pulpitum&quot; for the location for Gospel lections in the rubrics of the Use of Sarum referred both to the cathedral pulpitum screen and the parish rood loft. However, rood stairs in English parish churches are rarely, if ever, found to have been built wide enough to accommodate the Gospel procession required in the Sarum Use. The specific functions of the late medieval parish rood loft, over and above supporting the rood and its lights, remain an issue of conjecture and debate. In this respect it may be significant that, although there are terms for a rood screen in the vernacular languages of Europe, there is no counterpart specific term in liturgical Latin. Nor does the 13th century liturgical commentator Durandus refer directly to rood screens or rood lofts. This is consistent with the ritual uses of rood lofts being substantially a late medieval development.

==History==

===Early medieval altar screens and chancel screens===

Until the 6th century the altar of Christian churches would have been in full view of the congregation, separated only by a low altar rail around it. Large churches had a ciborium, or canopy on four columns, over the altar, from which hung altar curtains which were closed at certain points in the liturgy. Then, however, following the example of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, churches began to surround their altars with a colonnade or templon which supported a decorated architrave beam along which a curtain could be drawn to veil the altar at specific points in the consecration of the Eucharist; and this altar screen, with widely spaced columns, subsequently became standard in the major churches of Rome. In Rome the ritual choir tended to be located west of the altar screen, and this choir area was also surrounded by cancelli, or low chancel screens. These arrangements still survive in the Roman basilicas of San Clemente and Santa Maria in Cosmedin, as well as St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice. In the Eastern Church, the templon and its associated curtains and decorations evolved into the modern iconostasis. In the Western Church, the cancelli screens of the ritual choir developed into the choir stalls and pulpitum screen of major cathedral and monastic churches; but the colonnaded altar screen was superseded from the 10th century onwards, when the practice developed of raising a canopy or baldacchino, carrying veiling curtains, over the altar itself.

Many churches in Ireland and Scotland in the early Middle Ages were very small which may have served the same function as a rood screen. Contemporary sources suggest that the faithful may have remained outside the church for most of the mass; the priest would go outside for the first part of the mass including the reading of the gospel, and return inside the church, out of sight of the faithful, to consecrate the Eucharist.

Churches built in England in the 7th and 8th centuries consciously copied Roman practices; remains indicating early cancelli screens have been found in the monastic churches of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth, while the churches of the monasteries of Brixworth, Reculver and St Pancras Canterbury have been found to have had arcaded colonnades corresponding to the Roman altar screen, and it may be presumed that these too were equipped with curtains. Equivalent arcaded colonnades also survive in 10th-century monastic churches in Spain, such as San Miguel de Escalada. Some 19th-century liturgists supposed that these early altar screens might have represented the origins of the medieval rood screens; but this view is rejected by most current scholars, who emphasize that these screens were intended to separate the altar from the ritual choir, whereas the medieval rood screen separated the ritual choir from the lay congregation.
===Great Rood===
The Great Rood or Rood cross itself long preceded the development of screen lofts, originally being either just hung from the chancel arch or also supported by a plain beam across the arch, and high up, typically at the level of the capitals of the columns (if there are any), or near the point where the arch begins to lean inwards. Numerous near life-size crucifixes survive from the Romanesque period or earlier, with the Gero Cross in Cologne Cathedral (965–970) and the Volto Santo of Lucca the best known. Such crosses are commonly referred to in German as &quot;Triumphkreuz&quot; or triumphal cross. The prototype may have been one known to have been set up in Charlemagne&#x27;s Palatine Chapel at Aachen, apparently in gold foil worked over a wooden core in the manner of the Golden Madonna of Essen. The original location and support for the surviving figures is often not clear;  many are now hung on walls - but a number of northern European churches, especially in Germany and Scandinavia, preserve the original setting in full – they are known as a &quot;Triumphkreutz&quot; in German, from the &quot;triumphal arch&quot; (chancel arch in later terms) of Early Christian architecture. As in later examples a Virgin and Saint John often flanked the cross, and cherubim and other figures are sometimes seen.

===Parochial rood screens===
For most of the medieval period, there would have been no fixed screen or barrier separating the congregational space from the altar space in parish churches in the Latin West; although as noted above, a curtain might be drawn across the altar at specific points in the Mass. Following the exposition of the doctrine of transubstantiation at the fourth Lateran Council of 1215, clergy were required to ensure that the reserved sacrament was to be kept protected from irreverent access or abuse; and accordingly some form of permanent screen came to be seen as essential, as the parish nave was commonly kept open and used for a wide range of secular purposes. Hence the origin of the chancel screen was independent of the Great Rood; indeed most surviving early screens lack lofts, and do not appear ever to have had a rood cross mounted on them. Nevertheless, over time, the rood beam and its sculptures tended to become incorporated into the chancel screen in new or reworked churches. Over the succeeding three centuries, and especially in the latter period when it became standard for the screen to be topped by a rood loft facing the congregation, a range of local ritual practices developed which incorporated the rood and loft into the performance of the liturgy; especially in the Use of Sarum, the form of the missal that was most common in England. For example, during the 40 days of &quot;Lent&quot; the rood in England was obscured by the Lenten Veil, a large hanging suspended by stays from hooks set into the chancel arch; in such a way that it could be dropped abruptly to the ground on Palm Sunday, at the reading of Matthew 27:51 when the Veil of the Temple is torn asunder.

===Monastic rood screens===

The provisions of the Lateran Council had less effect on monastic churches and cathedrals in England; as these would have already been fitted with two transverse screens; a pulpitum screen separating off the ritual choir; and an additional rood screen one bay further west, delineating the area of the nave provided for lay worship (or in monastic churches of the Cistercian order, delineating the distinct church area reserved for the worship of lay brothers). The monastic rood screen invariably had a nave altar set against its western face, which, from at least the late 11th century onwards, was commonly dedicated to the Holy Cross; as for example in Norwich Cathedral, and in Castle Acre Priory. In the later medieval period many monastic churches erected an additional transverse parclose screen, or fence screen, to the west of the nave altar; an example of which survives as the chancel screen in Dunstable Priory in Bedfordshire. Hence the &quot;Rites of Durham&quot;, a detailed account of the liturgical arrangements of Durham Cathedral Priory before the Reformation, describes three transverse screens; fence screen, rood screen and pulpitum. and the triple same arrangement is also documented in the collegiate church of Ottery St Mary. In the rest of Europe, this multiple screen arrangement was only found in Cistercian churches, as at Maulbronn Monastery in southern Germany, but many other major churches, such as Albi Cathedral in France, inserted transverse screens in the later medieval period, or reconstructed existing choir screens on a greatly increased scale. In Italy, massive rood screens incorporating an ambo or pulpit facing the nave appear to have been universal in the churches of friars; but not in parish churches, there being no equivalent in the Roman Missal for the ritual elaborations of the Use of Sarum.

===The screen and Tridentine worship===
The decrees of the Council of Trent (1545–1563) enjoined that the celebration of the Mass should be made much more accessible to lay worshippers; and this was widely interpreted as requiring the removal of rood screens as physical and visual barriers, even though the council had made no explicit condemnation of screens. Already in 1565, Duke Cosimo de&#x27; Medici ordered the removal of the &quot;tramezzi&quot; from the Florentine friary churches of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella in accordance with the principles of the council. In 1577 Carlo Borromeo published , making no mention of the screen and emphasizing the importance of making the high altar visible to all worshippers; and in 1584 the Church of the Gesù was built in Rome as a demonstration of the new principles of Tridentine worship, having an altar rail but conspicuously lacking either a central rood or screen. Almost all medieval churches in Italy were subsequently re-ordered following this model; and most screens that impeded the view of the altar were removed, or their screening effect reduced, in other Catholic countries, with exceptions like Toledo Cathedral, Albi Cathedral, the church of Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse; and also in monasteries and convents, where the screen was preserved to maintain the enclosure. In Catholic Europe, parochial rood screens survive in substantial numbers only in Brittany, such as those at Plouvorn, Morbihan and Ploubezre .

==Symbolic significance==
The rood screen was a physical and symbolic barrier, separating the chancel, the domain of the clergy, from the nave where lay people gathered to worship. It was also a means of seeing; often it was solid only to waist height and richly decorated with pictures of saints and angels. Concealment and revelation were part of the mediaeval Mass. When kneeling, the congregation could not see the priest, but might do so through the upper part of the screen, when he elevated the Host on Sundays. In some churches, &#x27;squints&#x27; (holes in the screen) would ensure that everyone could see the elevation, as seeing the bread made flesh was significant for the congregation.

Moreover, while Sunday Masses were very important, there were also weekday services which were celebrated at secondary altars in front of the screen (such as the &quot;Jesus altar&quot;, erected for the worship of the Holy Name, a popular devotion in mediaeval times) which thus became the backdrop to the celebration of the Mass. The Rood itself provided a focus for worship according to the medieval Use of Sarum, most especially in Holy Week, when worship was highly elaborate. During Lent the Rood was veiled; on Palm Sunday it was revealed before the procession of palms and the congregation knelt before it. The whole Passion story would then be read from the Rood loft, at the foot of the crucifix by three priests. In the 1400s the rood screen in Dovercourt, UK, became a shrine when it gained a reputation for speaking.

==Post-Reformation, in England==

At the Reformation, the Reformers sought to destroy &quot;abused images&quot;, i.e. those statues and paintings which they alleged to have been the focus of superstitious adoration. Thus not a single mediaeval Rood survives in Britain. They were removed as a result of the 1547 Injunctions of Edward VI (some to be restored when Mary came to the throne and removed again under Elizabeth). Of original rood lofts, also considered suspect due to their association with superstitious veneration, very few are left; surviving examples in Wales being at the ancient churches in Llanelieu, Llanengan and Llanegryn. The rood screens themselves were sometimes demolished or cut down in height, but more commonly remained with their painted figures whitewashed and painted over with religious texts. Tympanums too were whitewashed. English cathedral churches maintained their choirs, and consequently their choir stalls and pulpitum screens; but generally demolished their rood screens entirely, although those of Peterborough and Canterbury survived into the 18th century.
In the century following the English Reformation newly built Anglican churches were invariably fitted with chancel screens, which served the purpose of differentiating a separate space in the chancel for communicants at Holy Communion, as was required in the newly adopted Book of Common Prayer. In effect, these chancel screens were rood screens without a surmounting loft or crucifix, and examples survive at St John Leeds and at Foremark. New screens were also erected in many medieval churches where they had been destroyed at the Reformation, as at Cartmel Priory and Abbey Dore. From the early 17th century it became normal for screens or tympanums to carry the royal arms of England, good examples of which survive in two of the London churches of Sir Christopher Wren, and also at Derby Cathedral. However, Wren&#x27;s design for the church of St James, Piccadilly, of 1684 dispensed with a chancel screen, retaining only rails around the altar itself, and this &quot;auditory church&quot; plan was widely adopted as a model for new churches from then on. In the 18th and 19th centuries hundreds of surviving medieval screens were removed altogether; today, in many British churches, the rood stair (which gave access to the rood loft) is often the only remaining trace of the former rood loft and screen.

In the 19th century, the architect Augustus Pugin campaigned for the re-introduction of rood screens into Catholic church architecture. His screens survive in Macclesfield and Cheadle, Staffordshire, although others have been removed. In Anglican churches, under the influence of the Cambridge Camden Society, many medieval screens were restored; though until the 20th century, generally without roods or with only a plain cross rather than a crucifix. A nearly complete restoration can be seen at Eye, Suffolk, where the rood screen dates from 1480. Its missing rood loft was reconstructed by Sir Ninian Comper in 1925, complete with a rood and figures of saints and angels, and gives a good impression of how a full rood group might have appeared in a mediaeval English church - except that the former tympanum has not been replaced. Indeed, because tympanums, repainted with the royal arms, were erroneously considered post-medieval, they were almost all removed in the course of 19th-century restorations. For parish churches, the 19th-century Tractarians tended, however, to prefer an arrangement whereby the chancel was distinguished from the nave only by steps and a low-gated screen wall or septum (as at All Saints, Margaret Street), so as not to obscure the congregation&#x27;s view of the altar. This arrangement was adopted for almost all new Anglican parish churches of the period.

Painted rood screens occur rarely, but some of the best surviving examples are in East Anglia.

== Notable examples ==
===Britain===

The earliest known example of a parochial rood screen in Britain, dating to the mid-13th century, is to be found at Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire; and a notable early stone screen (14th century) is found at Ilkeston, Derbyshire. Both these screens lack lofts, as do all surviving English screens earlier than the 15th century. However, some early screens, now lost, may be presumed to have had a loft surmounted by the Great Rood, as the churches of Colsterworth and Thurlby in Lincolnshire preserve rood stairs which can be dated stylistically to the beginning of the 13th century, and these represent the earliest surviving evidence of parochial screens; effectively contemporary with the Lateran Council. The majority of surviving screens are no earlier than the 15th century, such as those at Trull in Somerset and Attleborough in Norfolk. In many East Anglian and Devonian parish churches, original painted decoration survives on wooden screen panels, having been whitewashed over at the Reformation; although almost all have lost their rood beams and lofts, and many have been sawn off at the top of the panelled lower section. The quality of the painting and gilding is, some of it, of a very high order, notably those from the East Anglian Ranworth school of painters, of which examples can be found in Southwold and Blythburgh, as well as at Ranworth itself. The magnificent painted screen at St Michael and All Angels Church, Barton Turf in Norfolk is unique in giving an unusually complete view of the heavenly hierarchy, including nine orders of angels. Nikolaus Pevsner also identified the early-16th-century painted screen at Bridford, Devon, as being notable. The 16th-century screen at Charlton-on-Otmoor, said by Pevsner to be &quot;the finest in Oxfordshire&quot;, has an unusual custom associated with it, where the rood cross is garlanded with flowers and foliage twice a year, and until the 1850s the cross (which at that time resembled a large corn dolly) was carried in a May Day procession. A particularly large example can be found at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Uffculme, Devon, which is nearly 70 feet in length.

<doc id="951902" wikidata="Q633320" url="?curid=951902" title="HOTAS">
<text>HOTAS, an acronym of hands on throttle-and-stick, is the concept of placing buttons and switches on the throttle lever and flight control stick in an aircraft cockpit. By adopting such an arrangement, pilots are capable of performing all vital functions as well as flying the aircraft without having to remove their hands from the controls.

The HOTAS principle has also been applied outside the aviation sector, and has made a noticeable impact upon both the road vehicle design and gaming industries.

==History==
HOTAS was originally applied to military aircraft, starting with the British interceptor aircraft, the English Electric Lightning, in the late 1950s. The concept quickly spread to numerous other aircraft, such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, IAI Super Phantom, Mikoyan MiG-29, and Eurofighter Typhoon.

In more modern implementations, it is often combined with several other input systems, such as direct voice input and helmet-mounted display, to further reduce workload upon pilots as well as the need to divide their attention between the primary controls and other systems. Apart from the cockpit, the ground control stations (GCS) used by drone operators also commonly have HOTAS principles.

==Description==
HOTAS is a shorthand term which refers to the typical configuration of the core controls of fighter aircraft. Having all critical switches on the stick and throttle allows the pilot to keep both &quot;hands on throttle-and-stick&quot;. Used in combination with a head-up display (HUD), the pilot can focus their attention upon flying the aircraft, manipulating sensors, and engaging targets rather than looking for controls in the cockpit. The goal is to improve pilots&#x27; situational awareness, their ability to manipulate switch and button controls in turbulence, under stress, or during high G-force maneuvers, to improve reaction time, to minimize instances when hands must be removed from one or the other of the aircraft&#x27;s controls to use another aircraft system, and reduce total time spent doing so.

HOTAS enables the pilot to manipulate all the radar&#x27;s important functions without taking their hands away from the stick or throttle. It is typical for several other functions to be potentially incorporated into this control arrangement; features including a radio communications switch, chaff and flare countermeasure activation, speed brake controls, nose wheel steering, and aerial refueling disconnect may be controlled as such. The precise arrangement of each aircraft&#x27;s cockpit is unique, having been designed specific to mission requirements, equipment fitout, performance capabilities, and general airframe configuration of that aircraft. For instance, the F-15E Strike Eagle throttle incorporates the ability to interact with an onboard FLIR sensor.

==Applications==
===Aviation===
The HOTAS concept was initially pioneered by the Royal Air Force during the 1950s. The newly-developed supersonic point-defense interceptor aircraft, the English Electric Lightning, was furnished with the Ferranti AIRPASS radar and gunsight control system, giving its pilots an earlier implementation of the practice. By 1960, Ferranti were reportedly developing such fire control systems for foreign aircraft as well. HOTAS controls have become commonplace amongst the fighter aircraft of various nations. Various aircraft flown by the United States Air Force, including the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, feature such control systems.

Numerous cockpits of modern military aircraft have seen the HOTAS concept combined or enhanced by the use of further control technologies. One such example is the use of direct voice input; the combination of Voice and HOTAS control schemes has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;V-TAS&quot; concept. A prominent fighter aircraft to be furnished with a V-TAS cockpit is the Eurofighter Typhoon. Other examples includes the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, the Dassault Rafale and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen.

Another common enhancement has been the combination of helmet mounted display (HMD) systems. These commonly allow the pilot to control various systems using his line of sight, extending even to guiding missiles by simply looking at the target. One such HMD arrangement is the Soviet &quot;Schlem&quot; system, which has been used on both the Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighter aircraft; another is used on the F-35, which dispenses with a traditional head-up display mounted on the dashboard in favour of displaying such data via the HMD, allowing pilots to see target info regardless of the direction they are facing.

===Road vehicles===
Several car manufacturers have opted to integrate the HOTAS concept into the control systems of their vehicles. In the ordinary consumer market, a wide range of vehicles have had controls integrated into the steering wheel, typically for ancillary functions such as controlling the entertainment system, adjusting its cruise control and interacting with onboard computers and mobile phones. The purpose of such systems is that drivers can keep their hands upon the wheel, removing the need for the driver to look away from the road while still allowing such interactions to be performed.

Furthermore, numerous racecars have been produced with steering wheels configured to control various aspects of the car&#x27;s systems, such as communications and gear shifting. Such vehicles have been frequently used in competitive racing, such as Formula One and IndyCar.

===Gaming===
Several game controllers have incorporated HOTAS-like control arrangements. Such controllers have been commonly used by flight simulators; one example is the Thrustmaster Warthog, which is claimed to be based on the A-10. Optional controllers for the Xbox One games console include a flight stick that has been described as having HOTAS functionality. Other gaming alternatives include hands on stick and stick (HOSAS) and hands on stick and mouse (HOSAM).

===Remote operations===
Several ground control stations (GCS) have used HOTAS principles amongst their control schemes. Such stations are commonly used to remotely operate unmanned aerial vehicles.

<doc id="951908" wikidata="Q707269" url="?curid=951908" title="Treaty of Taipei">
<text>The Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty (; ), formally the Treaty of Peace between the Republic of China and Japan (; ) and commonly known as the Treaty of Taipei (), was a peace treaty between Japan and the Republic of China (ROC) signed in Taipei, Taiwan on 28 April 1952, and took effect on August 5 the same year, marking the formal end of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).

Neither the Republic of China nor the People&#x27;s Republic of China was invited to sign the San Francisco Peace Treaty due to disagreements by other countries as to which government was the legitimate government of China during and after the Chinese Civil War. Under pressure from the United States, Japan signed a separate peace treaty with the Republic of China to bring the war between the two states to a formal end with a victory for the ROC. Although the ROC itself was not a participant in the San Francisco Peace Conference due to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after 1945, this treaty largely corresponds to that of San Francisco in respect to the issue of Taiwan. In 1972, Japan unilaterally terminated this treaty after it established diplomatic relations with the PRC government.

==Key articles of the treaty==

;Article 2
It is recognized that under Article 2 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed at the city of San Francisco in the United States of America on September 8, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the San Francisco Treaty), Japan has renounced all right, title and claim to Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) as well as the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands.

;Article 3
The disposition of property of Japan and of its nationals in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores), and their claims, including debts, against the authorities of the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and the residents thereof, and the disposition in Japan of property of such authorities and residents and their claims, including debts, against Japan and its nationals, shall be the subject of special arrangements between the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of Japan. The terms nationals and residents whenever used in the present Treaty include juridical persons.

;Article 4
It is recognized that all treaties, conventions and agreements concluded before December 9, 1941, between China and Japan have become null and void as a consequence of the war.

;Article 9
The Republic of China and Japan will endeavor to conclude, as soon as possible, an agreement providing for the regulation or limitation of fishing and the conservation and development of fisheries on the high seas.

;Article 10
For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China, shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendents who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores); and juridical persons of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all those registered under the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).

==Relationship with the San Francisco Peace Treaty==

===Direct references===
In Articles 2 and 5, the Treaty of Taipei makes direct references to the San Francisco Peace Treaty (SFPT), also known as the Japanese Peace Treaty, which was signed and ratified by most Allies with the government of Japan respectively in 1951 and 1952. In Article 2, Japan confirms the terms of the SFPT, in which it renounced all right, title, and claim concerning the island of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratly Islands, and the Paracel Islands. In Protocol 1b of the Treaty of Taipei, the ROC waived the benefit of Article 14a1 of the SFPT, namely the services of the Japanese people in production, salvaging and other work for repairing the damage done during the war. In Protocol 1c, Articles 11 and 18 of the SFPT were excluded from the operation of Article 11 of the Treaty of Taipei.

===Dates===
The San Francisco Peace Treaty was signed on 8 September 1951 and ratified on 28 April 1952, the same date that the Treaty of Taipei was signed. The latter treaty entered into force on 5 August 1952 with the exchange of the instruments of ratification between Tokyo and Taipei. British officials did not consider Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty to be transferred to China by the SFPT; American officials recognized no such transfer in either treaty.

==Political status of Taiwan with respect to the ROC==
Article 10 of the Treaty states that &quot;for the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).&quot;

Ng Chiautong, chairman of the organization World United Formosans for Independence (WUFI), argued that Article 10 is not an affirmative definition of the Chinese nationality of the Taiwanese people but merely an agreement for the sake of convenience on the treatment of the Taiwanese as ROC nationals, because otherwise the inhabitants of Taiwan who were formerly Japanese nationals would not be able to travel to Japan. He also argues that the Treaty of Taipei does not call the Taiwanese &quot;Chinese nationals&quot; but prefers the term &quot;residents&quot;.

Independence supporters claim that the Nationality Law of the Republic of China was originally promulgated in February 1929, when Taiwan was argued to be a &quot;de jure&quot; part of Japan. The Nationality Law was revised in February 2000; however, there were no articles addressing the mass naturalization of Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens. They also point out that neither the San Francisco Treaty nor the Treaty of Taipei specifically provide for a transfer of sovereignty of Taiwan from Japan to China. Both have provisions for the renunciation of Japan&#x27;s claims of sovereignty, yet neither provides for a mechanism of transfer to China.

As the ROC officially announced the abrogation of the Treaty of Shimonoseki on more than one occasion, supporters of the ROC argue that China&#x27;s sovereignty over Taiwan was never in dispute. Moreover, Japan and the ROC by the Treaty of Taipei further &quot;recognised that all treaties, conventions and agreements concluded before December 9, 1941, between Japan and China have become null and void as a consequence of the war&quot;. It was therefore argued that the ROC Nationality Law which was promulgated in February 1929 would have applied to the residents on Taiwan, and it was unnecessary to address any nationality issues in the February 2000 revision.

On the other hand, Lung-chu Chen and W. M. Reisman, writing in the Yale Law Journal in 1972, argued that the title to Taiwan territory vested in Japan at the time of, and/or because of, the Treaty of Shimonoseki, as the language of the Treaty clearly indicated. Such title, insofar as it is title, ceases to be a bilateral contractual relationship and becomes a real relationship in international law. Though contract may be a modality for transferring title, title is not a contractual relationship. Hence once it vests, it can no longer be susceptible to denunciation by a party to the treaty. Y. Frank Chiang, writing in the Fordham International Law Journal in 2004, expanded upon this argument and claimed that there are no international law principles which can serve to validate a unilateral proclamation to abrogate (or revoke) a territorial treaty, whether based on a charge of being &quot;unequal,&quot; or due to a subsequent &quot;aggression&quot; of the other party to the treaty, or any other reason.

According to United Nations Treaty Series Volume 138, the Japanese plenipotentiary, Isao Kawada, acknowledged &quot;The present Treaty (Treaty of Peace) shall, in respect of the Republic of China, be applicable to all the territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government,&quot; which included Taiwan (Formosa), Penghu (the Pescadores) through the Exchange of Notes No. 1. Regarding the effect of the Exchange of Notes No. 1, in 1964, Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs Masayoshi Ōhira explained in the House of Councillors: &quot;This note of exchange has nothing to do with the Republic of China&#x27;s territorial sovereignty... The effect of this provision is under the prerequisite of the Republic of China&#x27;s actual administration over these territories and clearly does not mean its Government has the territorial sovereignty over these territories. We used the word &quot;control&quot; to make such a connotation obvious.&quot;

==Later Japanese perspectives==
On Sept. 29, 1972, Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China established formal diplomatic relations via the Japan–China Joint Communiqué. In 1980, while adjudicating a case concerning nationality, the Tokyo High Court wrote in its opinion that the treaty should lose its significance and should end as a result of the joint Communiqué.

Japanese lawyers have also argued that the Treaty of Taipei and the subsequent Sino-Japan Joint Communiqué waived the rights of Chinese nationals to seek war compensation from the Japanese government or corporations based in Japan. Nearly all such lawsuits have failed, despite support for the victims from some quarters of the Japanese society. Meanwhile, Beijing stated in 1995 that the joint communiqué waived reparations claims from the Chinese government only, but not from private citizens. It may face increased pressure to back private reparations demands as a stand against perceived Japanese nationalism, historical revisionism, and challenge of Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.

<doc id="951915" wikidata="Q3248292" url="?curid=951915" title="List of EC Comics publications">
<text>Entertaining Comics, commonly known as EC Comics, was a major publisher of comic books in the 1940s and 1950s. The letters EC originally stood for Educational Comics. EC&#x27;s &quot;Pre-Trend&quot; titles are those published by Max Gaines and his son William M. Gaines, who took over the family business after his father&#x27;s death in 1947.

In 1950, with the addition of writer and artist Al Feldstein, EC found success with their &quot;New Trend&quot; line, including their horror titles &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot;, &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot; and &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;. A line of science fiction titles soon followed, &quot;Weird Science&quot; and &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;, illustrated by the best artists in the business, such as Wallace Wood, Reed Crandall, Johnny Craig, George Evans, Graham Ingels, Jack Davis, Bill Elder, Joe Orlando, Al Williamson and Frank Frazetta. In addition to original stories, the books also featured adaptations of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short stories.

The &quot;New Direction&quot; group was a response to the Comics Code Authority. &quot;Picto-Fiction&quot; was a short-lived line of heavily illustrated short story magazines. Beginning in 1958, EC published annual and special editions of &quot;Mad&quot;.

===Reprints===

Many of these titles were reprinted during the past 30 years by publisher Russ Cochran, both independently and in conjunction with Gladstone Publishing and later with Gemstone Publishing.

Russ Cochran&#x27;s reprints include &quot;The Complete EC Library&quot; in black and white but with full-color covers; &quot;EC Annuals&quot; in full-color, comic-book sized reprints with four to six complete comics in each &quot;Annual&quot;; and &quot;EC Archives&quot;, full-color hardcover books containing six complete EC comics.

In 2012 Fantagraphics Books began publishing a series of artist- and theme-based collections of EC stories titled &quot;The EC Artists&#x27; Library&quot;.

The full-color &quot;EC Archives&quot; project was taken up by Dark Horse Comics in 2013, both reprinting previous Gladstone and Gemstone volumes and producing new volumes collecting further EC Comics titles.

<text>MOD Sealand (formerly RAF Sealand), is a Ministry of Defence installation in Flintshire, in the northeast corner of Wales, close to the border with England. 

It was a Royal Air Force station, active between 1916 and 2006. Under defence cuts announced in 2004, RAF Sealand was completely closed in April 2006. All remaining RAF units were moved to RAF Leeming. 

The site is now operated as a tri-service MOD installation and is home to DE&amp;S Deca.

==History==

Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust says the site is nationally important as it became home in 1916 to a flying school which, during World War I, was requisitioned by the War Office becoming RAF Sealand in 1924. The report said: &quot;The site of the former Dutton&#x27;s Flying School is an incredibly important historical location, effectively the origin point of the initial Royal Flying Corps and later RAF as a fighting force. &quot;The degree to which any traces of Dutton&#x27;s aerodrome survive as sub-surface deposits is currently unknown as there have been no investigative works.&quot;

It was originally a civilian airfield and was taken over by the military in 1916 for training. Two twin hangars, which were built in 1917, were used by the newly formed Royal Flying Corps. Originally named RFCS Shotwick and later RAF Shotwick, the station was finally named RAF Sealand in June 1924.

Immediately before World War II and in the early years of that war, it was the home of No. 5 Flying Training School RAF (5 FTS), equipped with Airspeed Oxfords. During the war, the Flying Training Schools provided what was in effect intermediate training for pilots who had received ab initio training and flown solo at an EFTS (Elementary Flying Training School) and who had subsequently been inducted into the RAF. Pilots thus arrived at No. 5 FTS RAF Sealand as APOs (Acting Pilot Officers) and upon satisfactory completion of intermediate training became Pilot Officers (POs), and were prepared for posting to a squadron or OTU (Operational Training Unit). Kenneth Cross spent time at No. 5 FTS as an instructor in the early 1930s. From 5 August 1940, the CFI (Chief Flying Instructor) was Edward Mortlock Donaldson. Amongst the pilots who trained at 5 FTS, RAF Sealand was Johnnie Johnson.

No. 30 Maintenance Unit RAF was formed there in 1937. In 1941 No. 19 Elementary Flying Training School RAF equipped with Tiger Moths was located at RAF Sealand.

In 1951 the station was taken over by the United States Air Force. The 30th Air Depot Wing was located at Sealand, but plans were made to relocate it to RAF Brize Norton, both in the UK. Most assigned personnel of the 30th Air Depot Group were reassigned to the 7558th Air Depot Group of the 59th Air Depot Wing, effective from 26 November 1951. All staff sections of the 30th Air Depot Wing were dissolved, and a Consolidated Adjutant and Military Personnel Section was formed. 30th Air Depot Wing was relieved from assignment to the 59th Air Depot Wing effective 27 November 1951. 30th Air Depot Wing began operating as a tenant organization at RAF Sealand, with base support for the wing being provided by the 7558th Air Depot Group as of 27 November 1951. Jurisdiction of RAF Sealand was transferred from the 30th Air Depot Wing to the 7558th Air Depot Wing on 27 November 1951. It was handed back to the RAF in 1957.

Sealand became a communications support base for RAF operations around the world. It functioned as a third-line repair station for avionics equipment for all three services. The Royal Air Force Almanac 1995 said that No. 30 Maintenance Unit RAF was at the time the main unit for airborne electronic and instrument equipment.

No. 631 Volunteer Gliding Squadron RAF, initially operating the Slingsby T.21 &quot;Sedbergh&quot; glider and then, more recently, flying the Viking TMk1 conventional winch-launched glider, operated at Sealand from 1963.

The gate guardian at the main gate until 1988 was Spitfire TD248. It was restored to flying condition in the 1990s.

In March 2006, No. 631 VGS relocated to RAF Woodvale to operate the Grob109b &#x27;Vigilant&#x27; self-launched motorglider.

The Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) took over the site in 2006 and handed it over to its successor organisation, the Defence Electronics and Components Agency (DECA), in 2015.

The MOD has previously contemplated using the site for several purposes, one of the most controversial of which was the idea to turn RAF Sealand into an emergency prison to cope with overcrowded prisons in England and Wales.

Permission was given in 2012 for a 5,000 job employment site, along with 1,000 homes. In 2015, the Welsh government agreed to fund a link road to the community so that building could start.

In 2019, DECA was granted a new Gate Guardian, to replace the Spitfire with a GR4 Tornado, Tail Number ZA607, due to the long standing relationship that the DECA site has with the Tornado aircraft 

==Current use==
MOD Sealand is a global repair hub for maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade services for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft.

In 2023, the DECA was subsumed into the wider Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) to become DE&amp;S Deca, whose role is dedicated to maintenance, repair, overhaul, upgrade, procurement and managed services provision across Defence electronics, components and general equipment support.

Facilities at MOD Sealand include clean rooms, faraday cages, radar chambers, calibration laboratory, cryptographic facility, storage and warehousing, 3D printing capability, aircraft components bay and cryogenics bay. Major customers include Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Thales, Rolls Royce, Raytheon, L3 Wescam, United States Department of Defence, Lockheed Martin, MBDA and more.

The MOD is set to establish an Advanced Technology Research Centre (ATRC) at MOD Sealand. The ATRC will conduct research in areas such as cybersecurity, software engineering, space, radio frequency, advanced sensing technologies, and next-generation propulsion.

Sealand Ranges are still used for shooting, where units from the forces and civilian target shooting clubs come to compete or practice shooting.

==In popular culture==
The RAF base lent its name to the 1981 song &quot;Sealand&quot; by Wirral band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

<text>James Thomas Ramey (August 17, 1944 – October 28, 1970), better known as Baby Huey, was an American singer. He was the frontman for the band Baby Huey &amp; the Babysitters, whose sole LP for Curtom Records in 1971 was influential in the development of hip-hop music.

==Life and career==
A native of Richmond, Indiana, James was the son of Robert and Ernestine Ramey. He moved to Chicago, Illinois, at the age of nineteen, and worked with several local bands as a singer. When he was still in high school, he worked with his first; the Vets. Due to a glandular disorder, Ramey weighed about 350 pounds (160 kg) around this time. His size contributed to his stage presence, but also to health problems. Nevertheless, he made light of his condition, adopting the stage name &quot;Baby Huey&quot; after Paramount Pictures&#x27; giant duckling cartoon character of the same name. In 1963, Ramey, organist/trumpeter Melvyn &quot;Deacon&quot; Jones, and guitarist Johnny Ross founded a band called Baby Huey &amp; the Babysitters, which became a popular local act and released several 45 RPM singles. The four songs, &quot;Beg Me&quot;, &quot;Monkey Man&quot;, &quot;Messin&#x27; with the Kid&quot; and &quot;Just Being Careful&quot; were spread over various single releases.

During the late 1960s, the band followed the lead of Sly &amp; the Family Stone and became a psychedelic soul act. Huey began wearing an Afro and donned psychedelic African-inspired robes, and adding sing-song, self-referential rhymes to his live performances. According to his bandmates, Ramey&#x27;s rhymes were very similar in style to those later popularized by rappers in hip-hop music. The Babysitters were a popular live act, but never took the time out to record an album. They toured widely in the US, and were seen by a member of the Rothschild family, who flew the band to Paris, France, to play at a family ball. The band&#x27;s appearances in clubs there led in turn to a feature in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine.

In early 1969, the band&#x27;s agent Marv Heiman secured them an audition with Curtom Records arranger Donny Hathaway. Heiman states that Hathaway came by the Thumbs Up club and was very impressed by the act, and got Curtom Records head Curtis Mayfield to come the following night. Mayfield wanted to sign Baby Huey, but not the band. Although the band participated in the recording of Ramey&#x27;s debut album, there were feelings of unease among them, and Jones quit the band during the recording. It is also likely that Ross had quit some time before.

By 1970, Ramey had developed an addiction to heroin, and his weight had increased to over . He began regularly missing gigs or turning up late, and, at the insistence of his bandmates, briefly entered rehabilitation in the spring of 1970. In addition to the heroin problem, Ramey was also drinking. Melvyn Jones described in his book that once while pouring his breakfast cereal, Ramey&#x27;s drug kit fell out of the box.

==Death==
On October 28, 1970, Ramey died of a drug-related heart attack at the age of twenty-six in a Chicago motel room. His funeral was held on November 1 in his native Richmond, Indiana, and he was buried there in Glen Havens Memorial Gardens.

==Legacy==
Baby Huey&#x27;s album, &quot;The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend&quot;, was released posthumously. Produced by Curtis Mayfield, the album features several Mayfield compositions, as well as a cover of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; and two original compositions by Ramey. The album did not sell well upon its initial release and was largely forgotten by the mainstream. Today, the album is considered a classic of its period.

On October 7, 1971, &quot;Jet&quot; magazine ran a small piece claiming his mother was granted authorization to audit the records of two recording firms, including Curtom Records. The order also permitted her to evaluate an undetermined estate left by him. According to Chicago attorney Vernon M. Rhinehart, Ramey had a salary of $3,500 per week.

Several songs from &quot;The Baby Huey Story&quot;, including &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;Listen to Me&quot;, and &quot;Mighty Mighty Children&quot;, have been frequently sampled by hip-hop producers since the 1980s. &quot;Hard Times&quot; alone has been sampled by dozens of artists, including Chill Rob G (&quot;Ride The Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Ride the Rhythm (1989)&quot;), Ice Cube (&quot;The Birth&quot;, &quot;Death Certificate&quot;), A Tribe Called Quest (&quot;Can I Kick It? (Spirit Mix)&quot;, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;), Ghostface Killah (&quot;Buck 50&quot;, &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot;), Biz Markie (&quot;The Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Biz Never Sleeps&quot;), and others. John Legend and the Roots covered &quot;Hard Times&quot; for their 2010 album &quot;Wake Up!&quot;. Many people, including the Babysitters themselves, see &quot;The Baby Huey Story&quot; as a significant and important influence on hip-hop music.

&quot;Listen to Me&quot; was featured as a rap backing track in two episodes of the 2016 Netflix series &quot;The Get Down&quot;. The 2020 Netflix true crime documentary &quot;Fear City: New York vs The Mafia&quot;, the 2011 film &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, the 2019 Norwegian HBO Max series &quot;Beforeigners&quot; and the 2023 miniseries &quot;The Continental: From the World of John Wick&quot; also use &quot;Hard Times&quot; as the opening theme. Both &quot;Listen to Me&quot; and &quot;Hard Times&quot; are featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;I Believe in Miracles&quot;.

<text>Peter John Sallis (1 February 1921 – 2 June 2017) was an English actor. He was the original voice of Wallace in the Academy Award-winning &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; films and played Norman &quot;Cleggy&quot; Clegg in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; from its 1973 inception until the final episode in 2010, making him the only actor to appear in all 295 episodes. Additionally, he portrayed Norman Clegg&#x27;s father in the prequel series &quot;First of the Summer Wine&quot;.

Among his television credits, Sallis appeared in &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (&quot;The Ice Warriors&quot;), &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; and &quot;The Ghosts of Motley Hall&quot;. Sallis&#x27; film appearances included the Hammer horror films &quot;The Curse of the Werewolf&quot; (1961) and &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; (1970).

==Early life==
Peter John Sallis was born on 1 February 1921 in Twickenham, Middlesex (now in Greater London), the only child of bank manager Harry Sallis (1889–1964) and Dorothy Amea Frances (&quot;née&quot; Barnard; 1891–1975). After attending Minchenden Grammar School in Southgate, Sallis went to work in a bank, working on shipping transactions. He and his family moved to Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, after his mother had fallen in love with her physician. But he continued to attend school, for a year, at Minchenden. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the Royal Air Force. He was unable to serve as aircrew because of a serum albumin disorder and was told he might black out at high altitudes. He became a wireless mechanic instead and went on to teach radio procedures at RAF Cranwell for which he won a Korda Scholarship.

==Career==
===Theatre work===
Sallis appeared in the Hal Prince-produced musical &quot;She Loves Me&quot; in 1963. Though not a success, it led to him making his Broadway debut the following year. Prince was producer of a musical based on the work of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes called &quot;Baker Street&quot;. Sallis was asked by Prince to take the role of Dr. Watson to Fritz Weaver&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes. The show ran for six months on Broadway. Just before &quot;Baker Street&quot; ended he was offered the role of Wally in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Inadmissible Evidence&quot;, which had been played by Arthur Lowe in London with Nicol Williamson reprising the lead role. The production was troubled with Williamson hitting producer David Merrick with a bottle and walking out before being persuaded to continue. The show was a minor success and ran for six months in New York, opening at the Belasco Theatre before transferring to the Shubert Theater. Sallis reprised his role in the 1968 film adaptation. Later, he was in the first West End production of &quot;Cabaret&quot; in 1968 opposite Judi Dench.

===Television and films===
Sallis appeared in more than 150 films and in more than 170 television shows. From 1955–1979 Sallis appeared in many of the ITV and BBC playhouse/play/theatre programmes including &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Play of the Week&quot;, &quot;Sunday Night Theatre&quot;, &quot;World Theatre&quot;, &quot;BBC Sunday Night Play&quot;, &quot;Musical Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;, &quot;Play of the Month&quot;, &quot;Plays of Today&quot;, &quot;Thirty Minute Theatre&quot;, &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;Armchair Cinema&quot;, &quot;Playhouse&quot;, &quot;BBC2 Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Jackanory Playhouse&quot;.

Sallis was also the only guest star actor to appear in more than one episode out of all the cast members from the TV series. The episodes &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; and &quot;The Knife Thrower&quot; were first shown in the 1955 TV movie/TV play &quot;Fcb TV Show No.1&quot;. They were included in the TV movie/TV play to give some idea of how an evening&#x27;s viewing might appear on the forthcoming ITA channel in London. Both of the episodes where eventually given a separate release on television by themselves as episodes of the TV series &quot;Strange Experiences&quot; in 1956. 

Sallis&#x27; first extended television role came in 1958 where he played Samuel Pepys in the BBC serial &quot;The Diary of Samuel Pepys&quot;.

He appeared in &quot;Danger Man&quot; in the episode &quot;Find and Destroy&quot; (1961) as Gordon. 

In 1962 Sallis appeared in &quot;Maigret&quot; in the episode &quot;The Reluctant Witnesses&quot; as Armand Lachaume.

Sallis appeared as schoolteacher Mr Gladstone in an episode of the first series of &quot;Catweazle&quot; in 1970. He was cast in the BBC comedy sitcom series &quot;The Culture Vultures&quot; (1970), which saw him play stuffy Professor George Hobbs to Leslie Phillips&#x27;s laid-back rogue Dr Michael Cunningham. During the production, Phillips was rushed to hospital with an internal haemorrhage and as a result, only five episodes were completed.

He appeared three times in the British police series &quot;Softly, Softly: Task Force&quot;. First in 1971 in the episode &quot;Cash and Carry&quot; as Lodge, then 1975 in the episode &quot;High Life&quot; as Professor Dowell and in 1976 in the episode &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; as Edward Letheridge.

===Later career===
In 1972, Sallis played Mr. Bruff in three episodes of the 1972 TV series &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Wilkie Collins.

Sallis was cast in the pilot for &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; which became the first episode of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; (retrospectively titled &quot;Of Funerals and Fish&quot;, 1973) as the unobtrusive lover of a quiet life, Norman Clegg. The pilot was successful and the BBC commissioned a series. Sallis had already worked on stage with Michael Bates, who played the self-appointed leader Blamire in the first two series. Sallis played the role of Clegg from 1973 to 2010, and was the only cast member to appear in every episode. He also appeared, in 1988, as Clegg&#x27;s father in &quot;First of the Summer Wine&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; set in 1939.

In 1974 Sallis started alongside Glyn Owen, Isobel Black, John Thaw, Roland Curram, Jill Dixon and John Bown in the TV show &quot;The Capone Investment&quot;.

In the series Evan Rhys-Jones and his wife Gwladys Rhys-Jones immediately start throwing their daughter, 27-year-old Ida Rhys-Jones, at Charlie.

===Voice acting===
In his autobiography, &quot;Fading into the Limelight&quot;, Sallis recounts a meeting with Orson Welles, where he received a mysterious telephone call summoning him to the deserted Gare d&#x27;Orsay in Paris where Welles announced he wanted him to dub Hungarian bit-players in his film adaptation of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; (1962). Sallis wrote that &quot;the episode was Kafka-esque, to coin a phrase&quot;. Sallis was the narrator on &quot;Rocky Hollow&quot; (1983) for all 26 episodes. He voiced Rat in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1984–90), based on the book by Kenneth Grahame and produced by Cosgrove Hall Films, alongside Michael Hordern as Badger, David Jason as Toad and Richard Pearson as Mole. Also in 1983 he played the lead character Jim Bloggs, alongside Brenda Bruce as Hilda, in a BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Raymond Briggs&#x27; &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;. From 1986-1987 Sallis voiced Harold in all six episodes of the BBC Radio series &quot;Living with Betty&quot; and he also voiced the lead character Hercule Poirot, alongside Manning Wilson as Col Johnson, in a BBC Radio 4 audio cassette titled &quot;Hercule Poirot&#x27;s Christmas&quot;.

Sallis appeared in the last episode of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; (1992) and he later starred alongside Brenda Blethyn, Kevin Whately and Anna Massey in the one-off ITV1 drama &quot;Belonging&quot; (2004).

Sallis also voiced Hugo in the animated series &quot;Victor and Hugo: Bunglers in Crime&quot; (filling in for &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; co-star David Jason who was the usual voice of Hugo, although Jason&#x27;s voice of Hugo can still be heard in the opening and closing theme songs) for audio cassettes as well. He narrated &quot;Postman Pat&#x27;s Parcel of Stories&quot; in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Postman Pat&quot; for audio cassettes. In 2005 Sallis narrated the audio CD of &quot;Six-Dinner Sid&quot; based on the book of the same name by Inga Moore. The following year when Sallis released his autobiography book titled &quot;Fading into the Limelight: Peter Sallis the Autobiography&quot; he also narrated his autobiography book for an audio CD that was released the same year.

In 2001 Sallis had a cameo voiceover role in the TV movie &quot;Hotel!&quot; where he provided the radio voice of Little Ashford Flying Club.

While a student in 1983, Nick Park wrote to Sallis asking him if he would voice his character Wallace, an eccentric inventor. Sallis agreed to do so for a donation of £50 to his favourite charity. The work was eventually released in 1989 and Aardman Animations&#x27; &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: A Grand Day Out&quot; went on to win a BAFTA award. Sallis reprised his role in the Oscar and BAFTA Award-winning films &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; in 1993 and &quot;A Close Shave&quot; in 1995.

Throughout the late 1990s to the early 2000s Sallis continued to voice Wallace in many &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; video games, adverts and audio cassettes, and returned to voice Wallace in 2002 TV series &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&#x27;s Cracking Contraptions&quot; and in the Oscar-winning 2005 motion picture film &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, for which he won an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production. In 2008, Sallis voiced a new &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; adventure, &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot;. Following the &quot;Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, Sallis&#x27;s eyesight began to fail as a result of macular degeneration and he used a talking portable typewriter with a specially illuminated scanner to continue working. His last role as Wallace was in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&#x27;s World of Invention&quot;. Two years later Sallis retired from acting due to ill health, with Ben Whitehead taking over as the voice of Wallace.

==Autobiography==
In 2006, Sallis published an autobiography entitled &quot;Fading into the Limelight&quot;. As well as his 36 years in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, Sallis also recounts the early era of his relationship with &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; creator Nick Park when it took six years for &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; to be completed. He says that his work as Wallace has &quot;raised his standing a few notches in the public eye&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sallis married actress Elaine Usher at St. John&#x27;s Wood Church in London on 9 February 1957. However, it was a turbulent relationship, with Usher leaving him sixteen times before they divorced in 1965 on grounds of desertion and adultery. They eventually reconciled and continued to live together until 1999. Sallis remained close to Usher until her death in 2014. They had one son, Crispian Sallis (born 1959), and two grandchildren. Sallis also had three cats.

Sallis suffered from macular degeneration, and in 2005 recorded an appeal on BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Macular Society, of which he was a patron. He also recorded on behalf of the society a television appeal, which was broadcast on BBC One on 8 March 2009. Following his diagnosis of the disease, Aardman produced a short animated film for the society.

Sallis was awarded the OBE in the 2007 Birthday Honours for services to Drama. On 17 May 2009, he appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, selecting Sibelius&#x27; Symphony No. 5 in E-flat major as his favourite.

==Death==
Sallis died from natural causes at the Denville Hall nursing home in Northwood, London on 2 June 2017, aged 96. He was buried next to fellow &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; actor Bill Owen in the churchyard of St John&#x27;s Parish Church, Upperthong, near the town of Holmfirth in Yorkshire, the home of the sitcom.

<text>In typography, a bouma ( ) is the shape of a cluster of letters, often a whole word. It is a reduction of &quot;Bouma-shape&quot;, which was probably first used in Paul Saenger&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Space between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading&quot;, although Saenger himself attributes it to Insup &amp; Maurice Martin Taylor. Its origin is in reference to hypotheses by the prominent vision researcher Herman Bouma, who studied the shapes and confusability of letters and letter strings.

Some typographers believe that, when reading, people can recognize words by deciphering boumas, not just individual letters, or that the shape of the word is related to readability and/or legibility. The claim is that this is a natural strategy for increasing reading efficiency. However, considerable study and experimentation by cognitive psychologists led to their general acceptance of a different, and largely contradictory, theory by the end of the 1980s: parallel letterwise recognition. Since 2000, parallel letterwise recognition has been more evangelized to typographers by Microsoft&#x27;s Dr Kevin Larson, via conference presentations and a widely read article. Nonetheless, ongoing research (starting from 2009) often supports the bouma model of reading.

<text>In corsetry, a bone is one of the rigid parts of a corset that forms its frame and gives it rigidity. The purpose of the &quot;boning&quot; in a corset varies slightly from era to era. Generally, the cinching/shaping properties of corsetry puts strain onto the fabric from which the corset is made. The boning supports the desired shape and prevents wrinkling of the corset fabric. Bones, and the substances used for the purpose, are generically called &quot;boning&quot;; however, the name likely arises from the use of whalebone in early corsets.

Modern corset boning comes in two different qualities: the more durable metal and less durable plastic. Since the turn of the 20th century, steel boning was the standard for a high quality corset, coming in two different types: flat spring steel and spiral steel. While spring steel is most preferred for being thin and flexible, it only has the ability to bend in a single direction. Spiral steel is able to bend both horizontally and vertically, its only drawbacks being the fact that it&#x27;s not as stable and tends to not support larger figures. 

Traditionally, plastic boning such as Rigilene has been considered low quality and unsupportive. New advances in plastic boning have brought about synthetic whalebone. It is used widely in historical reconstruction due to its similarities to traditional whalebone. It is lightweight and very supportive. It also molds better to the body, allowing for a much curvier shape.

==Purpose, history and materials==
The purpose of the boning in a corset varied slightly from era to era. Generally, the cinching/shaping properties of corsetry puts strain onto the fabric from which the corset is made. The boning supports the desired shape and prevents wrinkling of the corset fabric. Bones, and the substances used for the purpose, are generically called boning.

The corsets of the 16th through 18th centuries (called &quot;stays&quot;, &quot;bodies&quot; or &quot;corps&quot;) were intended to mold the upper torso into a rigid, cone-like shape. The earliest corsets had a wooden busk placed down the center fronts of the corsets; these early busks were different from the more modern steel busks which have clasps to facilitate opening and closing the corset from the front. Corsets of the 17th and 18th centuries were most often heavily boned, with little or no space between the bone channels. This was necessary to force the body to conform to the desired shape of the era. At the time, the most popular materials used for boning were giant reeds or whalebone. Whalebone was the most commonly-used and most expensive material.

The early 19th century brought a very different style of corset (still called &quot;stays&quot;). A return to the natural or &quot;classical&quot; form was embraced by fashion, and for the first time in corset history, the bust was separated. To achieve and enhance the separation of the bust, the &quot;busk&quot; was used. The busk was essentially a large, rigid &quot;popsicle stick&quot;- shaped bone inserted into a casing down the center front of the corset. These busks were made from either wood, ivory, bone, or baleen and were often elaborately carved and given as gifts. It was most often the only bone within corsets of this type, as other required shaping was provided by the cut of the pattern and enhanced by cording (cotton or similar cords within casings). The cording of the early 19th-century corsets (stays) was often very elaborate, and examples of many beautiful corded stays can be found in museum collections.
The mid-19th century brought more complex corsets (no longer called stays) and tighter lacing, which required more boning to create the desired shape. The modern split busk was popular, as it allowed corsets to easily open in the front. Steel and baleen (whalebone) were the dominant materials for boning and were occasionally used together. By the last quarter of the 19th century, baleen was growing increasingly more expensive and becoming more difficult to acquire. This encouraged experimentation into types of materials used for boning. Some of the most popular alternatives were cork strips, cording, watchspring steel, Coraline, and Featherbone. Coraline was manufactured from the straight, stiff fibers of the Mexican ixtle plant, bound together by two strands of thread wrapped in opposite directions. Featherbone was manufactured from the quills of feathers. The extremely rigid and elongated torso popular in the 1880s to early 1890s required extensive boning to support and enhance the steam-molded and starched corsets of the period.

By the late 1890s, a lighter, shorter style of corset was becoming popular, coming in simpler shapes and using much less boning than in the previous decade. This style of corset quickly evolved into the beautifully complex early Edwardian style corsets. These corsets from 1901–1908 relied heavily on the complex cut of the pattern to create and accentuate the shape. Boning was used wholly for the support of the shape created by the cut of the fabric. Bones were most commonly made of steel by this time, and were often placed in pairs within casings that did not follow the placement of the corset&#x27;s seams. By the 1910s, the cut of corsets had become longer, although less complex, and boning became merely a means to keep the corset&#x27;s fabric taut. By the mid-1910s to 1930s, the emphasis was placed on comfort and the rigid steel boning was almost completely replaced by the more flexible spiral steel boning.

Modern steel bones come in two basic varieties: &quot;flat&quot; steel boning (sometimes called just &quot;enamel&quot; or &quot;rigid&quot; boning) and &quot;spiral&quot; steel boning. Spiral boning is flattish but thicker than flat boning, because of the tips required on the ends. Flat boning bends in only one direction, while spiral steel boning bends easily in two directions. Spiral steel boning may thus be used in curved channels, or where a more gentle support is acceptable. Both varieties are rigid lengthwise. Modern corset makers differ greatly in the type and size of boning that they use. For those unable to procure steel boning, there are several alternative options, depending on the style of the corset desired. Cable ties (found in 36, 48 and 52 inch lengths) from a hardware store have been used by costumers.

Providing a much more flexible shape, synthetic whalebone comes in a variety of sizes. 4mmx1mm is most suitable for pre-19th century stays, especially fully boned stays. 6mmx1.5 is most suitable for 19th century corsets.

<text>A corsetmaker is a specialist tailor who makes corsets. Corsetmakers are frequently known by the French equivalent terms corsetier (male) and corsetière (female). Staymaker is an obsolete name for a corsetmaker.

==Design and distribution==

The best corsetmakers are highly skilled tailors with a knowledge of anatomy that enables them to make well-fitting, long-lasting corsets. Corsetmakers who reproduce historical styles must be familiar with historical fashions and costumes that span centuries of history. Individual corsetmakers often favour a certain style, and frequently have differing theories and opinions about the physical impact and benefits of various corsets, thereby influencing their corset design and creation.
The main consideration of corset design is duration of use. For short-term use, e.g. used for a special event such as a wedding, a corset will be worn briefly and so is not subject to wear, therefore need not be of the highest quality of construction. For long-term use, e.g., by tightlacing or waist training, corsets must be made to exact standards and are best custom-fitted and designed for the individual wearer. Single weakness or flaws tend to be visible. Some custom-made gowns have corsets built into the design; a talented dressmaker may also be a skilled corset-maker.

Some companies had travelling saleswomen, corsetières who ordered the tailored corsets from the company. Well-known are Spirella (1904–1989), Barcley, and Spenser.

==Notable corsetmakers==
*Roxey Ann Caplin - British writer and inventor
*Catherine Allsop Griswold - a Connecticut corsetmaker who held 30 patents, the most of any woman in America at the time.
*Thomas Paine - American political activist, philosopher, political theorist, and revolutionary. He trained to become a staymaker as a teenager, as it was his family trade, but did not stay in the profession after his teen years.

<text>The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Japanese: , Chinese: 中华人民共和国和日本国和平友好条约, pinyin: &quot;Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó hé Rìběnguó hépíng yǒuhǎo tiáoyuē&quot;) is a peace treaty concluded between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Japan on August 12, 1978. The treaty was signed in Beijing by Huang Hua (1913 – 2010), Foreign Minister of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and Sunao Sonoda (1913 – 1984), Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan. The treaty went into effect on October 23, 1978, with the state visit of Vice Premier of the PRC Deng Xiaoping (1904 – 1997) to Japan. The treaty had its origin in the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China of 1972. Negotiations on a formal peace treaty began in 1974, but were drawn out over various disputes until 1978. The treaty ultimately consisted of five articles, and was strongly opposed by the Soviet Union.

<text>Archaeology is the study of human activity in the past, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which includes artifacts, architecture, biofacts (also known as eco-facts) and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record).

The development of the field of archaeology has its roots with history and with those who were interested in the past, such as kings and queens who wanted to show past glories of their respective nations. In the 6th century BCE, Nabonidus of the Neo-Babylonian Empire excavated, surveyed and restored sites built more than a millennium earlier under Naram-sin of Akkad. The 5th-century-BCE Greek historian Herodotus was the first scholar to systematically study the past and also an early examiner of artifacts. In Medieval India, the study of the past was recorded. In the Song Empire (960–1279) of imperial China, Chinese scholar-officials unearthed, studied, and cataloged ancient artifacts, a native practice that continued into the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) before adoption of Western methods. The 15th and 16th centuries saw the rise of antiquarians in Renaissance Europe such as Flavio Biondo who were interested in the collection of artifacts. The antiquarian movement shifted into nationalism as personal collections turned into national museums. It evolved into a much more systematic discipline in the late 19th century and became a widely used tool for historical and anthropological research in the 20th century. During this time there were also significant advances in the technology used in the field.

The OED first cites &quot;archaeologist&quot; from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. &quot;Archaeology&quot;, from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call &quot;ancient history&quot; generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.

==Beginnings ==

Khaemweset, a son of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II, was known for his keen interest in identifying and restoring monuments of Egypt&#x27;s past, such as Djoser&#x27;s step pyramid. This pyramid, having been built in the 27th century BCE, predated Khaemweset by approximately 1,400 years. Due to his activities, he is sometimes nicknamed &quot;the first Egyptologist&quot;.

In ancient Mesopotamia, a foundation deposit of the Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin (ruled ) was discovered and analysed by king Nabonidus of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, , who is thus known as the first archaeologist. Not only did he lead the first excavations which were to find the foundation deposits of the temples of Šamaš the sun god, the warrior goddess Anunitu (both located in Sippar), and the sanctuary that Naram-Sin built to the moon god, located in Harran, but he also had them restored to their former glory. He was also the first to date an archaeological artifact in his attempt to date Naram-Sin&#x27;s temple during his search for it. Even though his estimate was inaccurate by about 1,500 years, it was still a very good one considering the lack of accurate dating technology.

Early systemic investigation and historiography can be traced back to the Greek historian Herodotus (). He was the first western scholar to systematically collect artifacts and test their accuracy. He was also the first to make a compelling narrative of the past. He is known for a set of nine books called the &quot;Histories&quot;, in which he wrote everything he could learn about different regions. He discussed the causes and consequences of the Greco-Persian Wars. He also explored the Nile and Delphi. However, scholars have found errors in his records and believe he probably did not go as far up the Nile as he claimed.

==Antiquarians==
Archaeology later concerned itself with the antiquarianism movement. Antiquarians studied history with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. They usually were wealthy people. They collected artifacts and displayed them in cabinets of curios. Antiquarianism also focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary Sir Richard Colt Hoare, &quot;We speak from facts not theory&quot;. Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a science took place during the Enlightenment era in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.

===Imperial China===
During the Song dynasty (960–1279) in China, educated gentry became interested in the antiquarian pursuit of art collecting. Neo-Confucian scholar-officials were generally concerned with archaeological pursuits in order to revive the use of ancient Shang, Zhou, and Han relics in state rituals. This attitude was criticized by the polymath official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; of 1088. He endorsed the idea that materials, technologies, and objects of antiquity should be studied for their functionality and for the discovery of ancient manufacturing techniques. Although a distinct minority, there were others who took the discipline as seriously as Shen did. For instance, the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129) stressed the importance of using ancient inscriptions to correct discrepancies and errors in later historical texts discussing ancient events. Native Chinese antiquarian studies waned during the Yuan (1279–1368) and Ming (1368–1644) dynasties, were revived during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), but never developed into a systematic discipline of archaeology outside of Chinese historiography. The &quot;Chong xiu Xuanhe bogutu&quot; (重修宣和博古圖) archaeological collection catalogue commissioned by Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1125) was widely reprinted in the 16th century during the Ming period, but it was criticized by Hong Mai (1123–1202) for containing inaccuracies about Han dynasty artifacts.

===Medieval India===

The 12th century Indian scholar Kalhana&#x27;s writings involved recording of local traditions, examining manuscripts, inscriptions, coins and architectures, which is described as one of the earliest traces of archaeology. One of his notable work is called &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; which was completed in 1150 and is described as one of the first history books of India.

===Renaissance Europe===
In Europe, interest in the remains of Greco-Roman civilisation and the rediscovery of classical culture began in the Late Middle Ages. Despite the importance of antiquarian writing in the literature of ancient Rome, such as Livy&#x27;s discussion of ancient monuments, scholars generally view antiquarianism as emerging only in the Middle Ages. Flavio Biondo, an Italian Renaissance humanist historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and topography of ancient Rome in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. The itinerant scholar Ciriaco de&#x27; Pizzicolli or Cyriacus of Ancona (1391–) also traveled throughout Greece to record his findings on ancient buildings and objects. Ciriaco traveled all around the Eastern Mediterranean, noting his archaeological discoveries in a day-book, &quot;Commentaria&quot;, that eventually filled six volumes. He has been called the &quot;father of archaeology&quot; by historians such as Edward W. Bodnar:

English antiquarians of the 16th century including John Leland and William Camden conducted topographical surveys of England&#x27;s countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered. These individuals were frequently clergymen: many vicars recorded local landmarks within their parishes, details of the landscape and ancient monuments such as standing stones—even if they did not always understand the significance of what they were seeing.

===Shift to nationalism===
In the late 18th to 19th century archaeology became a national endeavor as personal cabinets of curios turned into national museums. People were now being hired to go out and collect artifacts to make a nation&#x27;s collection more grand and to show how far a nation&#x27;s reach extends. For example, Giovanni Battista Belzoni was hired by Henry Salt, the British consul to Egypt, to gather antiquities for Britain. In nineteenth-century Mexico, the expansion of the National Museum of Anthropology and the excavation of major archaeological ruins by Leopoldo Batres were part of the liberal regime of Porfirio Díaz to create a glorious image of Mexico&#x27;s pre-Hispanic past.

===First excavations===
Among the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation were Stonehenge and other megalithic monuments in England. The first known excavations made at Stonehenge were conducted by William Harvey and Gilbert North in the early 17th century. Both Inigo Jones and the Duke of Buckingham also dug there shortly afterwards. John Aubrey was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous megalithic and other field monuments in southern England. He also mapped the Avebury henge monument. He wrote &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot; in the late 17th century as a survey of early urban and military sites, including Roman towns, &quot;camps&quot; (hillforts), and castles, and a review of archaeological remains, including sepulchral monuments, roads, coins and urns. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield shapes.

William Stukeley was another antiquarian who contributed to the early development of archaeology in the early 18th century. He also investigated the prehistoric monuments of Stonehenge and Avebury, work for which he has been remembered as &quot;probably... the most important of the early forerunners of the discipline of archaeology&quot;. He was one of the first to attempt to date the megaliths, arguing that they were a remnant of the pre-Roman druidic religion.
Excavations were carried out in the ancient towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, both of which had been covered by ashes during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738 under the auspices of King Charles VII of Naples. In Herculaneum, the Theatre, the Basilica and the Villa of the Papyri were discovered in 1768. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of ancient frescos, had much impact throughout Europe.

A very influential figure in the development of the theoretical and systematic study of the past through its physical remains was &quot;the prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology,&quot; Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Winckelmann was a founder of scientific archaeology by first applying empirical categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the classical (Greek and Roman) history of art and architecture. His original approach was based on detailed empirical examinations of artefacts from which reasoned conclusions could be drawn and theories developed about ancient societies.

In America, Thomas Jefferson, possibly inspired by his experiences in Europe, supervised the systematic excavation of a Native American burial mound on his land in Virginia in 1784. Although Jefferson&#x27;s investigative methods were ahead of his time, they were primitive by today&#x27;s standards.
Napoleon&#x27;s army carried out excavations during its Egyptian campaign, in 1798–1801, which also was the first major overseas archaeological expedition. The emperor took with him a force of 500 civilian scientists, specialists in fields such as biology, chemistry and languages, in order to carry out a full study of the ancient civilisation. The work of Jean-François Champollion in deciphering the Rosetta Stone to discover the hidden meaning of hieroglyphics proved the key to the study of Egyptology.

However, prior to the development of modern techniques excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as stratification and context were completely overlooked. For instance, in 1803, there was widespread criticism of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin for removing the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon in Athens. The marble sculptures themselves, however, were valued by his critics only for their aesthetic qualities, not for the information they contained about Ancient Greek civilization.

In the first half of the 19th century many other archaeological expeditions were organized; Giovanni Battista Belzoni and Henry Salt collected Ancient Egyptian artifacts for the British Museum, Paul Émile Botta excavated the palace of Assyrian ruler Sargon II, Austen Henry Layard unearthed the ruins of Babylon and Nimrud and discovered the Library of Ashurbanipal and Robert Koldeway and Karl Richard Lepsius excavated sites in the Middle East. However, the methodology was still poor, and the digging was aimed at the discovery of artefacts and monuments.

==Development of archaeological method==

The father of archaeological excavation was William Cunnington (1754–1810). He undertook excavations in Wiltshire from around 1798, in collaboration with his regular excavators Stephen and John Parker of Heytesbury. Cunnington&#x27;s work was funded by a number of patrons, the wealthiest of whom was Richard Colt Hoare, who had inherited the Stourhead estate from his grandfather in 1785. Hoare turned his attention to antiquarian pursuits and began funding Cunnington&#x27;s excavations in 1804. The latter&#x27;s site reports and descriptions were published by Hoare in a book entitled Ancient Historie of Wiltshire in 1810, a copy of which is kept at Stourhead.

Cunnington made meticulous recordings of mainly neolithic and Bronze Age barrows, and the terms he used to categorise and describe them are still used by archaeologists today. The first reference to the use of a trowel on an archaeological site was made in a letter from Cunnington to Hoare in 1808, which describes John Parker using one in the excavation of Bush Barrow.

One of the major achievements of 19th century archaeology was the development of stratigraphy. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new geological and palaeontological work of scholars like William Smith, James Hutton and Charles Lyell. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of prehistorical and Bronze Age sites. In the third and fourth decade of the 19th century, archaeologists like Jacques Boucher de Perthes and Christian Jürgensen Thomsen began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.

Another important development was the idea of deep time. Before this, people had the notion that the earth was quite young. James Ussher used the Old Testament and calculated that the origins of the world were on 23 October 4004 BCE (a Sunday). Later Jacques Boucher de Perthes (1788–1868) established a much deeper sense of time in &quot;Antiquités celtiques et antédiluviennes&quot; (1847).

===Professionalisation===
As late as the mid-19th century, archaeology was still regarded as an amateur pastime by scholars. Britain&#x27;s large colonial empire provided a great opportunity for such &#x27;amateurs&#x27; to unearth and study the antiquities of many other cultures. A major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and ethnologist, Augustus Pitt Rivers.

In 1880, he began excavations on lands that came to him in inheritance and which contained a wealth of archaeological material from the Roman and Saxon periods. He excavated these over seventeen seasons, beginning in the mid-1880s and ending with his death. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. Influenced by the evolutionary writings of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, he arranged the artefacts typologically and (within types) chronologically. This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artefacts, was a revolutionary innovation in museum design, and was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that &quot;all&quot; artefacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued. This focus on everyday objects as the key to understanding the past broke decisively with past archaeological practice, which had often verged on treasure hunting.
William Flinders Petrie is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the Great Pyramid in Egypt during the 1880s. Many hypotheses as to how the pyramids had been constructed had been proposed (such as by Charles Piazzi Smyth), but Petrie&#x27;s exemplary analysis of the architecture of Giza disproved these hypothesis and still provides much of the basic data regarding the pyramid plateau to this day.
His painstaking recording and study of artefacts, both in Egypt and later in Palestine, laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that &quot;I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.&quot; Petrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings, which revolutionized the chronological basis of Egyptology. He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including Howard Carter, who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BCE pharaoh Tutankhamun.

The first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with the public was that of Hissarlik, on the site of ancient Troy, carried out by Heinrich Schliemann, Frank Calvert, Wilhelm Dörpfeld and Carl Blegen in the 1870s. These scholars distinguished nine successive cities, from prehistory to the Hellenistic period. Their work has been criticized as rough and damaging—Kenneth W. Harl wrote that Schliemann&#x27;s excavations were carried out with such rough methods that he did to Troy what the Greeks could not do in their times, destroying and levelling down the entire city walls to the ground.

Meanwhile, the work of Sir Arthur Evans at Knossos in Crete revealed the ancient existence of an advanced civilisation. Many of the finds from this site were catalogued and brought to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, where they could be studied by classicists, while an attempt was made to reconstruct much of the original site. Although this was done in a manner that would be considered inappropriate today, it helped raise the profile of archaeology considerably.

<text>The Great Britain national rugby league team represents Great Britain in rugby league. Administered by the Rugby Football League (RFL), the team is nicknamed The Lions.

For most of the 20th century, the Great Britain team toured overseas, played against foreign touring teams and competed in the Rugby League World Cup, which they won three times: in 1954, 1960 and 1972.

Since 1995, the RFL has sent separate home nations teams to the World Cup. Great Britain continued to compete as a Test playing nation both home and away. They competed against Australia for the Ashes, and New Zealand for the Baskerville Shield, as well the Tri-Nations series with both Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain also played in series and tours against France, Papua New Guinea and Fiji.

In 2006, the RFL announced that after the 2007 All Golds Tour the Great Britain team would no longer compete on a regular basis. Instead its players would represent England, Wales and Scotland at Test level, and it was planned that the Great Britain team would come together in future only for occasional tours, similar to the British and Irish Lions in rugby union.

The Lions most recently played in 2019, in a tour of Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.

== History ==

===Early years===
Initially Great Britain were represented by a team made up of players from the Northern Rugby Football Union, known simply as the &quot;Northern Union&quot; side. On 25 January 1908, the first ever Great Britain test match took place at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds, versus New Zealand. At the time, Great Britain were referred to as the &quot;Northern Union&quot; – they won the game 14–6 before a crowd of 8,000. The second test went to New Zealand by 18–6, before 14,000 at Stamford Bridge, London. The third test was played at Cheltenham, and 4,000 watched New Zealand win 8–5.

The first Kangaroos arrived in England on 27 September 1908, they toured Britain, losing more games than they won. They played their first ever test against the Northern Union in December at Loftus Road, London; a last minute penalty against the Kangaroos for an obstruction play handed England a goal and a 22-all draw in front of a crowd of 2,000. The second test in Newcastle in January 1909 attracted a crowd of 22,000, and the Northern Union won 15–5. The third test was played at Villa Park, Birmingham, the Northern Union winning again 6–5 before a crowd of 9,000. The Australians suggested that the series should be named &quot;the Ashes&quot; after the cricket series of the same name.

The first British tour of the Southern Hemisphere began on 4 June 1910 captained by James Lomas. The Northern Union played New South Wales in front of 33,000 spectators in Sydney, losing 28–14. But they won the first test in Sydney against Australia 27–20 in front of 42,000 at the old Sydney Showground. They then won the second test in Brisbane 22–17. The tourists also recorded a 13-all draw against a combined Australasian side in front of over 42,000 at the Agricultural Ground. These tests have been credited as making rugby league the predominant code of rugby football in Australia, a situation which continues to this day. Upon arriving in Auckland on 17 July, the team was accorded a mayoral reception. On 30 July, they defeated New Zealand 52–20.

The second Lions tour down under in 1914, led by Harold Wagstaff, became the stuff of legend. They played three Tests in eight days with the first two in three days. After sharing the first two tests, Great Britain finished with only 10 men due to injuries, but still managed to hang on for a 14–6 victory in Sydney in July 1914. It was dubbed &quot;Rorke&#x27;s Drift test&quot;, after a battle in the Anglo-Zulu War.

=== The inter-war period ===
Great Britain defeated a touring Australian side 2–1 in the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain to win back the Ashes that had been lost in 1920. They would not be lost again until 1950.

The 1924 Lions added the red and blue chevron to the all-white jersey.

On the 1928 tour of Australasia, Great Britain lost only five of 24 tour matches. The Lions won the first Test 15–12. On Saturday 14 July 1928, when Great Britain met Australia in the second Test on a sea of mud at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Lions won 8–0, containing the Kangaroos who, for the only time in Test match history, failed to score on home soil. After clinching the Test series, the Lions lost the final Test. They were presented with the Ashes Trophy by the Australians, which the two countries have competed for ever since.

Great Britain then set off for New Zealand, where they lost the first Test. On Saturday 18 August 1928 the Lions travelled to Tahuna Park, Dunedin, for the second Test. The Lions led 7–5 at the interval and went on to win 13–5. Seven days later the Lions won the third Test 6–5 to clinch the series two Tests to one. Before coming home they played some missionary games in Canada, which led to the formation of a rugby league competition in that country.

On 5 October 1929, Australia won the first Test at the Boulevard, Hull 31–8. Great Britain won the second 9–3 at Headingley, Leeds on 9 November 1929. The third test, held at Station Road, Swinton, resulted in a 0–0 draw with Australia having a try disallowed in the last minute. With the series tied 1–1, an unprecedented fourth test was played at the Athletic Grounds, Rochdale. Britain won the test 3–0 to take the Ashes.

Britain again won the Ashes in 1932. In 1932 the police locked the SCG gates after 70,204 crammed into the SCG. This would remain the world record test match attendance until eclipsed by the 73,631 who attended the 1992 World Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1933 in Paris, England and Australia play the first game of rugby league in France. The match was one sided, with Australia winning 63–13 in front of a crowd of 5,000, but the seed was sown.

Jim Sullivan was asked to go again as captain of the 1936 tourists, but declined on the grounds of his wife&#x27;s ill health. Britain again won the Ashes in 1936.

===Post-war===

The 1946 Great Britain Lions tour saw the team sail to Australia on HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot;. After a five-day train journey across Australia, Gus Risman&#x27;s team retained the Ashes, drawing the first Test and winning the other two Tests to become the only touring side to remain unbeaten on a tour of Australia.

In 1947, Roy Francis was the first of a long line of black players to be capped by Great Britain.

Australia made their 7th tour to the UK in 1948, and this time played the Ashes series against a side officially called Great Britain. Great Britain won both games 16–7 and 23–21.

In 1950, the British Lions returned to Perth soundly beating a full Western Australia team at Claremont Showground. In the Ashes series against Clive Churchill&#x27;s Australians, the 1950 touring side led by Bradford Northern&#x27;s Ernest Ward had the unfortunate distinction of being the first England/Great Britain team to lose the Ashes since 1920. Great Britain won the opening game 6–4 on an SCG mudheap, but lost the second test played on a dry track at the Brisbane Cricket Ground 15–3. Returning to Sydney the third test was played again on a mudheap, as Sydney was lashed by wet weather. The game was in the balance at 2–2 until Australian winger Ron Roberts crossed in front of the Paddington Stand to seal the 5–2 win.

On Saturday 10 November 1951 the first televised rugby league match was broadcast from Station Road, Swinton, where Great Britain met New Zealand in the second Test of the 1951 series. A last-minute penalty saw the home side triumph by 20–19. The first Test was played at Odsal, Bradford, and the third Test at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds.

Dickie Williams was captain of Great Britain for the 1954 tour of Australia, a gruelling schedule which lasted just over 3 months, and included 22 matches in Australia with a further 10 in New Zealand. In one match against New South Wales the referee left the field in disgust at the players&#x27; persistent fighting after 56 minutes, so the match was abandoned. The first Test was held at the SCG, Sydney, and was won by Australia. 47,096 people attended the Great Britain versus Australia Test on 3 July 1954 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, which is still the ground&#x27;s attendance record for any sport. The most famous incident of the tour took place on Saturday 10 July, the weekend before the third Test. With the series level at one win each, the Great Britain management decided to rest most of their Test players and field a side which was predominantly made up of forwards for the game against New South Wales. The match was an exceptionally brutal affair and was abandoned in the second half after a brawl between all 26 players. Great Britain lost the deciding third Test 20–16 in Sydney in front of 67,577 fans.

===1954–1960: World Cup debut===

Prior to the 1957 World Cup held in Australia, Great Britain played three matches against France, alternating between venues in Great Britain and France. Great Britain won two and drew one of the fixtures: 45–12 Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds; 19–19 Stade Municipal, Toulouse; 29–14 Knowsley Road, St. Helens.

The first Rugby League World Cup took place in France in October and November 1954. Dave Valentine&#x27;s side, without most of the first choice internationals was not expected to do well, but beat Australia and New Zealand to finish top of the table level on points with France. The final, played at the Parc des Princes packed with 30,000 fans, took place on 13 November, where Great Britain beat France 16–12. Second-row forward Don Robinson was named man of the match.

On 11 December 1955 the first official Test match took place between Great Britain and France, at Parc des Princes, the French winning 17–5.

The Kangaroos toured in 1956, Great Britain won the first Test 21–10 at Central Park, Wigan and Australia won the second 9–22 at Odsal, Bradford. Great Britain defeated Australia 19–0 in the third Test held at Station Road, Swinton, to take the Ashes series 2–1.

Britain were the favourites to win the second World Cup. A group stage was held first. Great Britain beat France 23–5 at Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney, lost 6–31 to Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney, and 21–29 to New Zealand at Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney. Australia won all three of their games and were declared the champions as the organisers decided no official final was necessary. Great Britain finished second.

After the 1957 World Cup series in Australia, Alan Prescott&#x27;s team went to New Zealand and then stopped off in South Africa to play some missionary games. Mixed-race Billy Boston flew home directly and alone, as apartheid was still in force. Both teams regarded the matches as mere exhibitions and engaged in a &quot;touch&quot; type of football at Benoni, Gauteng. The British team played with more gusto in the second match at Durban but the French team refused to take the game seriously. Feelings ran high between the two visiting teams after this match with the French players expressing resentment at Britain&#x27;s sudden volte-face. It was anticipated that the third match at East London, in view of the strained relations now existing between both teams, would prove a thriller. This supposed grudge match did not eventuate, and the series faded out with Britain again winning with consummate ease.

Great Britain played two matches against France after the 1957 World Cup, alternating between venues in Great Britain and France. Great Britain won both tests; 14–25 at Stade Municipal, Toulouse; 44–15 at Central Park, Wigan.

On Saturday 14 June 1958, Great Britain lost the first Test 25–8 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 48 hours later the British Lions played Brisbane team, Britain won 34–29, and then remained undefeated throughout the rest of their visit to Australia. On 5 July 1958, the Lions defeated Australia 25–18 in the second test at Brisbane with only eight fit players on the pitch. Captain Alan Prescott played for 77 minutes with a broken arm, substitutions not being permitted until six years later, the match became known as &quot;Prescott&#x27;s Match&quot; or &quot;the Battle of Brisbane&quot;. That lifted the tourists to clinch the series by winning the decider 40–17 in Sydney. rlhalloffame.org.uk – rlhalloffame Resources and Information. The third test win is still a record win against the Australians on their turf.

In 1958, Great Britain were defeated 23–9 by France at Stade Lesdiguières.

During Australia&#x27;s 1959 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain, Australia won the first Test 22–14 at Station Road, Swinton. Great Britain won the second 11–10 at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds, and won the third 18–12 at Central Park, Wigan with a match-winning try in the last few minutes, to take the Ashes series 2–1. This was the last Ashes won on home soil to date.

===1960s===

In the March prior to the 1960 World Cup, Great Britain played two matches against France, alternating between venues in France and Great Britain. Great Britain drew one and lost one of the fixtures: France won 20–18 at Stade Municipal, Toulouse. On 65 minutes a colossal brawl erupted when Georges Fages kicked Derek Turner on the chin following a tackle on Fages. When the dust settled Turner was ordered off, but five minutes elapsed before he was finally escorted from the field by Bill Fallowfield, secretary of the Rugby Football League. There was 17–17 draw at Knowsley Road, St. Helens.

In 1960, the World Cup was played on home soil. The tournament is decided on a league system but with both Great Britain and Australia undefeated, the last match became a virtual World Cup final. Eric Ashton lifted the trophy after a 10–3 victory at Odsal in front of a crowd of 32,733 and Britain played in an exhibition game in lieu of a decider.

In December 1960, Great Britain beat France 21–10 at Stade André Moga, Bordeaux, and in January 1961, they won again 27–8 at Knowsley Road, St Helens. New Zealand toured Great Britain in 1961. They won the first of the three matches 29–11 at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds.

Eric Ashton was again captain of the 1962 Lions side and Colin Hutton was coach. The British Lions won the opening two Tests 31–12 and then 17–10, the first time in 34 years that they had won the first two matches on Australian soil. The first Test was played before more than 70,000 spectators. The third Test was staged at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday 14 July 1962. A controversial last-minute Australian try and the subsequent touchline conversion resulted in a 17–18 defeat; but for this, the 62 Lions would have been the first team to achieve a whitewash of the Australians.

After crossing the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, they lost both Tests against New Zealand with a team depleted with injuries. The first Test 19–0, only the second time a British team had been held scoreless. In the second Test at Carlaw Park, Auckland on Saturday 11 August 1962, several players had to play out of position and New Zealand won 27–8. Sixteen Lions visited South Africa on the way home and played three matches against South Africa. The second of those matches took place on Saturday 25 August in Durban, Great Britain won 39–33.

In 1962, Great Britain were defeated 17–12 by France at Stade Gilbert Brutus, Perpignan.

In 1963, Great Britain were defeated 2–1 in the Ashes series by the touring 1963 Kangaroos. After the Aussies had won the first test 28–2 at Wembley in front of only 13,946 fans, the second test was scheduled for Station Road in Swinton. In what became known as the &quot;Swinton Massacre&quot;, the Kangaroos wrapped up the series with a 50–12 win over the Lions, including 3 tries by Ken Irvine, 2 each to Reg Gasnier and Peter Dimond, while Graeme Langlands scored two himself as well as kicking seven goals. The Lions avoided a series whitewash with a hard-fought 16–5 win in the third test at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds which is regarded as one of the most brutal tests played between the two teams. Referee &quot;Sergeant Major&quot; Eric Clay was prominent when he sent off Lions blind-side prop (10) Cliff Watson, as well as Australians Brian Hambly and Barry Muir. After giving Clay a few &#x27;choice words&#x27; as he left the field, Muir later spoke to Clay claiming the English referee had robbed the Australians. According to Muir, Clay&#x27;s response was &quot;Barry, I&#x27;ve got to live here.&quot;

Great Britain beat France 12–0 in Avignon in 1964, they also won the return leg 10–0 in Leeds but were booed off the field. All ten points had come from the boot of David Hobbs.

Great Britain won the first Test 16–11 at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds. The second Test was played at the old White City Stadium on Friday 3 November 1967, it was the only Test match ever to be played there. Australian tour manager Jack Drews appealed to the thousands of Australians living in London to support the tourists and was rewarded with a crowd of 17,445, many of them supporting Australia. Australia won 17–11, and then went on to clinch the series with an 11–3 victory in a blizzard at Swinton.

The fourth Rugby League World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, in 1968. The match between Great Britain and Australia attracted an attendance of 62,256, the highest for a rugby league World Cup match. However, Great Britain failed to make the final.

The 1968 Great Britain World Cup squad made a visit to Queensland on their way back to Britain.
They played three matches in three days, the middle match being against North Queensland at Townsville on Sunday 16 June. Britain won 25–2.

===1970s===
The last time that Britain won the Ashes was in 1970 with emerging stars like Roger Millward and Mal Reilly. Under coach Johnny Whiteley, they won the series 2–1 in Australia after winning the final two test matches. Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one – making them the most successful British tourists to date.

The fifth Rugby League World Cup was held in England in November 1970. Britain were hot favourites, and won all three of their group stage games. All the other nations lost two games each, and Australia qualified for the final largely on the back of an impressive tally of points against New Zealand. The final was held at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds. Although Great Britain dominated the possession, the Kangaroos were able to exploit their chances, and ran out unexpected 12–7 winners in a scrappy, bad-tempered game that became known as &quot;The Battle of Leeds&quot;.

In 1971 New Zealand wins a series in Britain for the first time, winning 17–14 in Castleford and 18–13 in Salford.
Clive Sullivan had risen to the Great Britain captaincy, the first black captain of a home international side, and was in charge for the 1972 World Cup held in France. Jim Challinor was coach. Sullivan and Challinor led the under-rated Lions to victory over Australia (27–21), France (13–4) and New Zealand (53–19), claiming a try in each game. Clive scored a long distance try in the final in Stade Gerland, Lyon as they drew with Australia 10–10 after extra time. Great Britain won their third World Cup by virtue of having a better qualifying record. Sullivan was the last British captain to lift the World Cup.

Saturday 24 November 1973. Great Britain had won the first Test three weeks earlier at Wembley, and needed to win at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds to retain the Ashes. Australia won 14–6, their first Test victory at Headingley. The Kangaroos went on to win the third Test 15–5 at Wilderspool on 1 December 1973, and so took the Ashes back to Australia, where they have remained ever since.

Great Britain visited Australia and New Zealand in 1974. British players had been playing under the &quot;six tackles&quot; rule for almost two years, but switched back to the old &quot;four tackles&quot; rule for international competition as the rule had not been changed in New Zealand. The Australian&#x27;s won the first Ashes Test 12–6 at Lang Park, but bounced back to win the 2nd test at the Sydney Cricket Ground 16–11. The deciding test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 20 July was won 22–18 by the home side. In New Zealand, the Kiwis won the first Test 13–8. The second Test was staged at the Addington Showgrounds, Christchurch on Saturday 4 August 1974 and was won by Great Britain 17–8. Britain went on to win the third Test 20–0 to clinch the series.

Great Britain did not compete in the 1975 World Cup as the UK was represented by teams from England and Wales for the first time in a World Cup.

On 6 July 1975, at Boroko, Papua New Guinea played their first ever international. They were beaten 40–12 by Great Britain.

There was a reappearance for the Great Britain team at the 1977 World Cup in Australasia under coach David Watkins. Australia topped the table and Great Britain were the underdogs going to the Final, held at the Sydney Cricket Ground. They managed to dominate the possession, and it took a last minute try from Australia&#x27;s John Kolc to win the Cup 13–12 in front of 24,457 spectators.

The 1978 Ashes series were won by the touring Australians, but Great Britain, labelled a Dads&#x27; Army team thanks to their front row with both props (Jim Mills and Brian Lockwood) and hooker (Tony Fisher) all being over 30 years of age, beat the Kangaroos in the second test 18–14, at Bradford&#x27;s Odsal Stadium, before a crowd of 26,447. It was to be 10 years, and 15 consecutive test defeats before Britain beat the Kangaroos again. Peter Fox was the coach.

The tour of Australasia in 1979 was a disastrous one in many ways. A number of players withdrew because of injury, and coach Eric Ashton was unable to fly out with his squad because his daughter had been involved in a car crash. Injuries during the tour caused three influential players to return home early, whilst attendance figures at tour matches were disappointing due to the lacklustre performances of the tourists, and led to a financial loss of over £300,000 on the trip. The Australian&#x27;s, coached by Frank Stanton and captained by George Peponis, won the series 3–0. Australian centre Michael Cronin scored a total of 54 points for the series with two tries and 24 goals. Incredibly he outscored the Lions who only scored 18 points for the entire series, losing the first test 35–0 in Brisbane, and the second and third tests 24–16 and 28–2 in Sydney. Total attendance for the series was just 66,752 compared to the 133,791 who saw the three tests on the 1974 Lions tour. Critics from both Britain and Australia called the team the weakest and least committed touring side ever to tour Australia and that poor results had been the cause of such a dramatic drop in attendances.

The first Test at Lang Park in Brisbane was staged on Saturday 16 June 1979, and attracted a healthy crowd of 23,051, although it was actually the lowest for an Anglo-Australian Test in Australia for over sixty years. After a string of encouraging results in the opening matches; Britain were confident of pulling off an upset. However the Lions, 16–0 down at half-time, crashed to a 35–0 defeat, the heaviest Britain had suffered in a Test played in Australia. The tour&#x27;s largest attendance came in the second test at the SCG with 26,857. But the third test could only draw 16,844 to the SCG, at the time the lowest ever attendance in Australia for an Anglo-Australian test.

===1980s===

Johnny Whiteley became coach again in 1980 until 1982. He achieved a drawn series against New Zealand in 1980, but was given a tougher time by the touring Australians.

Rugby league was taken into a new dimension by the 1982 Kangaroos side. The &#x27;Invincibles&#x27; became the first team to win every game of the tour (15 games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators at Boothferry Park. The Kangaroos only led 10–4 at half time, but unleashed a second half onslaught that left the British game stunned. Coached by Frank Stanton and captained by Max Krilich, the Kangaroos included veterans such as Craig Young, Steve Rogers, Kerry Boustead, the fiery Les Boyd, Rod Reddy and Ray Price, as well as a crop of young players on their way to superstar status in rugby league including Mal Meninga, tour vice-captain Wally Lewis, Brett Kenny, Peter Sterling, Eric Grothe and Wayne Pearce. The second test in Wigan ended 27–6 to the visitors. During the second half of that game, Kangaroos replacement Wally Lewis fired a bullet like 20 metre pass for Meninga to score in the corner. Soundly thrashed to that point of the series, the play did psychological damage to the Lions who were left wondering just how good the Australians really were if someone who could pass like Lewis couldn&#x27;t even make the starting XIII. The third test was held at Headingley, Leeds which ended 32–8, though the game was in the balance until the final ten minutes when the Kangaroos superior fitness told and they ran in four late tries. The Lions scored their only try of the series in the second half at Headingley when Hull winger Steve Evans scored. This was the beginning of an era of Australian dominance.

Frank Myler took over as coach following the Invincibles tour. Great Britain toured Australia in 1984 and both Garry Schofield and Ellery Hanley made their test débuts, with 18 year old Schofield in particular earning praise from the Australian&#x27;s with his attacking displays in the centres (Hanley, better known later in his career as a lock forward or five-eighth, played on the wing for each test of the series). After losing the first two Tests, Britain was expected to capitulate completely in the third Test, which was staged at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday 7 July 1984.

The Lions then moved on to New Zealand where the Kiwis won the first two Tests in Auckland and Christchurch and the Lions faced the prospect of losing each match of a three-Test series against the Kiwis for the first time. On Saturday 28 July 1984, the Third Test was held at Carlaw Park, Auckland. The Lions started well and went into a 16–8 lead in the second half before New Zealand recovered to score 24 points in the last 25 minutes and win 32–16. It was the first time they had scored over 30 points in a Test match against Great Britain.

Maurice Bamford took over as coach in 1984. His term as coach of the national side also included the formation of the Great Britain under-21 team to replace the U/24 side. The ninth Rugby League World Cup was played out between 1985 and 1988, with teams playing each other on a home and away basis. These matches were fitted into the normal international programme of three-match test series between the nations, with a pre-designated match from each series counting as the world cup fixture.

In 1985, Garry Schofield re-wrote the record books by scoring four tries as Great Britain beat New Zealand in a test series at Central Park, Wigan. Shaun Edwards made his debut for Great Britain against France in 1985 at Headingley. Britain went on to beat France 50–4, a record score.

In 1986 a then record northern hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attends the first test of the Ashes series at Old Trafford. The Australians won 38–16, continuing their dominance of The Lions. The 1986 Kangaroos, who like their 1982 counterparts (and included 5 players from &quot;The Invincibles&quot; – Wally Lewis (captain), Peter Sterling (vice-captain), Mal Meninga, Brett Kenny and Gene Miles) went through Great Britain and France undefeated and earned the nickname &quot;The Unbeatables&quot;. The second test at Elland Road in Leeds was a disaster for the Lions with the Kangaroos leading 34–0 late in the match before winning 34–4 after Schofield scored a late consolation try. Australia completed the series sweep when they won the third test at Wigan 24–15 after a much improved performance by Maurice Bamford&#x27;s men.

Mal Reilly was appointed Head Coach in 1987 and opened with six wins, four against France and two over Papua New Guinea. In 1987, Ellery Hanley was appointed Great Britain captain and on the 1988 tour down under took the Lions the closest they had been for a decade to regaining the Ashes. On 9 July 1988, Great Britain beat Australia 26–12 in Sydney to win the 3rd test, though the series had already been lost. This was the first British victory over Australia since their 18–14 win at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford on 5 November 1978. The third test also saw the smallest Anglo-Australian test attendance in Australia when only 15,944 attended the dead rubber game at the new Sydney Football Stadium. The first test played on 11 June and won 17–6 by Australia in front of 24,480 at the Sydney Football Stadium, was the 100th Anglo-Australian test match.

During that 1988 tour, the Lions suffered two embarrassing losses in the lead up to the first test against Australia. The Lions lost 36–12 to a Northern Division (NSW) representative team in Tamworth in what was called &quot;Black Sunday&quot;. According to reports, after the game Mal Reilly locked his team in the change room and upbraided them for 20 minutes before allowing the media in. But worse was to come just 2 days later when they lost 30–0 to reigning Sydney premiers Manly-Warringah only 4 days out from the test. The Manly team that night, missing 7 regular players (including 4 Australian test players), were coached by Mal Reilly&#x27;s 1972 and 1973 Sydney premiership winning teammate Bob Fulton who would become the Australian coach in 1989 and spend almost a decade tormenting the Lions.

The final group stage match of the 1985/88 World Cup qualifier between New Zealand and Great Britain became a sudden death battle for a spot in the final, Britain only needed a draw. In the event the Kiwis came through 12–10, and went on to lose to Australia in the World Cup final at Eden Park, Auckland.

The tenth Rugby League World Cup followed a similar format covering the years 1989 and 1992. In 1989 Great Britain won their first home series since 1965, beating New Zealand by two tests to one. With France and Papua New Guinea not being competitive, it became a straight fight between Britain and the Kiwis for the right to meet the Kangaroos in the final. In the event the Lions were able to just edge out the Kiwis on points difference.

===1990s: Super League War===
France gained their first win in 23 years across the Channel in 1990 when they won 25–18 at Headingley.

In 1990, Great Britain made their first full-scale tour of Papua New Guinea. A combination of soaring temperatures, altitude and the atmosphere created by over 11,500 Papua New Guinea fans, many clinging to trees outside the tiny, ramshackle ground in Goroka, unnerved the tourists. Papua New Guinea beat Great Britain 20–18, the Lions&#x27; one and only loss to the Kumuls. This saw the series tied 1–1. Great Britain then won a series 2–1 in New Zealand.

During the 1990 Ashes series, Great Britain defeated Australia 19–12 in the first test at Wembley on Saturday 27 October 1990 in front of a new record home crowd of 54,567. It was the first time that an Australian team had been beaten in Britain for twelve years and 37 matches. Australia made eight changes for the second Test, held at Old Trafford on Saturday 10 November 1990. With the scores tied at 10–10, with twenty seconds to go, Kangaroos halfback Ricky Stuart raced 70 metres before slipping the ball to Mal Meninga who dived over to give the Kangaroos a 14–10 victory. The third Test was won by Australia 14–0 to complete a 2–1 series win.

During the 1992 tour of Australia and New Zealand, Great Britain lost the first Ashes test 22–6 in Sydney. Two weeks later, led by Garry Schofield and with a pack made up entirely of Wigan players, Great Britain grabbed a memorable 33–10 win in Melbourne on a night where the weather and (neutral) ground was more like a winters night in northern England than &#x27;sunny&#x27; Australia. However, back in familiar territory, Australia won the third test 16–10 in Brisbane.

The 1989-92 Rugby League World Cup was played out over three-years, the Great Britain side squeezed into the final on goal difference ahead of New Zealand. The World Cup final at Wembley set a world record attendance for a rugby league international: 73,631 saw Australia edge Great Britain 10–6 with the only try coming from Steve Renouf late in the game. This figure beat the previous record of 70,204 set at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the 1932 Ashes series. The attendance figure at Wembley would remain the largest for an international until 74,468 saw the Kangaroos defeat New Zealand 34–2 in the 2013 World Cup final at Old Trafford. The 1992 Final was set to be played in Australia due to the Kangaroos finishing unbeaten at the top of the table. However, with the prospect of a 70,000+ attendance at Wembley on offer, the Australian Rugby League consented to the game being held in London.

Great Britain won the 1993 home series against New Zealand by three tests to nil, including a 17–0 victory at Wembley in the first test. During the second test in Wigan, Lions and Wigan winger Martin Offiah&#x27;s reputation as the fastest player in the game, which had taken a big hit when he was defeated in a 100-metre match race with Parramatta Eels (Australia) flyer Lee Oudenryn during the 1992 Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, was further dented when he made a break and despite having a 3-metre start, was run down from behind and unceremoniously bundled into touch by Kiwi and Leeds centre Kevin Iro.

Mal Reilly stood down as Great Britain coach in 1994. Ellery Hanley was appointed coach of the Great Britain national rugby league team for the Ashes series of 1994, which was held in Great Britain. The 1994 Kangaroo tour was the last played in the conventional format, where the Australian side plays a number of matches against British club and provincial outfits, in addition to the Test matches. Great Britain won the first test 8–4 at Wembley after playing most of the game without captain Shaun Edwards who was sent off in the first half for a high tackle on Bradley Clyde. Without Edwards (suspended) and Wembley man of the match, fullback Jonathan Davies who had dislocated his shoulder late in the first test, the Lions lost the second test 38–8 at Old Trafford. Edwards returned for the third test which was won 23–4 by Australia at Elland Road.

In 1996 Great Britain embarked on a disastrous tour of the Southern Hemisphere under coach Phil Larder. They did not play Australia because of the Super League War, but played and won their first and so far only test against Fiji, before losing a series 3–0 to New Zealand. Several British players had to be sent home early because the tour ran out of money.

Andy Goodway was appointed Great Britain coach in 1997. At the end of that year Great Britain played a home three-Test series against the Australian Super League and lost 2–1. Despite the series being given official test status, these games are not widely regarded as a genuine Ashes series because so many Australian stars were again missing. The continuing Super League war meant that the 1998 Kangaroo Tour was cancelled.

The outbreak of the Super League war meant that the next Kangaroo tour, set for 1998, never eventuated.

With the Super League War finally over in 1999, Great Britain travelled to the Southern Hemisphere for the first Tri-Nations tournament with Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain struggled to overcome Burleigh Bears in a warm-up match, went on to suffer humiliating defeats by world champions Australia and New Zealand, and then struggled to beat the New Zealand Maoris. A huge gap has opened up once again between the northern and southern hemispheres. In January 2000, Andy Goodway quit as Great Britain coach with a year left on his contract.

=== 2000–2007: Record defeats and whitewashes ===
In February 2001, Australian David Waite was appointed full-time head coach and technical director ahead of the Ashes series. The Australians arrived in Britain for the first Ashes series since 1994. Great Britain surprised everyone by winning the first test, but lost the next two.

In July 2002 Great Britain suffered a record test defeat 64–10 to Australia in Sydney.

In November 2003 Great Britain lost an Ashes series 0–3 on home soil, having led all three matches with less than five minutes to play. This was considered one of the most humiliating defeats in Great Britain Test history, as with injuries and pullouts, Australia had sent a virtually third-choice side to Great Britain. Great Britain was heavily favoured to win the Ashes, but lost each Test. Waite stepped down from his role.

In 2004, Brian Noble was appointed part-time coach. The &#x27;...and Ireland&#x27; was dropped from the team name as they reverted to &#x27;Great Britain&#x27;. The Lions beat Australia in a tournament for the first time in 31 years when they won the league phase of the 2004 rugby league tri-nations with the most points, only to be comprehensively beaten 44–4 in the final by Australia.

In the 2005 Tri Nations, Great Britain only won one game. This came against eventual tournament winners the Kiwis by over twenty points and dominated the entire match. However, the Kiwis posted their highest score ever against Great Britain in London. Great Britain did not make the final of the tournament.

On 4 November 2006, Great Britain beat Australia 23–12 in Sydney for the first time since 1988. However, they lost the other three games and went down to a record defeat against New Zealand. They failed to make the final of the tournament for the second year in succession.

At the end of the 2006 season Brian Noble&#x27;s contract as Head Coach ran out and was not renewed. It was believed that the RFL were looking for a full-time Head Coach and Brian Noble wasn&#x27;t willing to surrender his role as Wigan Warriors Head Coach. In March 2007, Leeds coach, Tony Smith was installed as coach. His first game in charge of Great Britain was the victory over France. The 3–0 whitewash of New Zealand followed starting with a 20–14 victory at Huddersfield, a 44–0 thrashing of the Kiwis in the 2nd test at Hull and a final test win at the JJB by 28 points to 22.

In 2007, Great Britain enjoyed a three nil series whitewash of the touring New Zealand side in the 2007 All Golds tour.

=== 2008–2019: Hiatus ===
After the 2007 All Golds tour Great Britain was retired with the focus being more on strengthening the other three home nations. Henceforth, the Great Britain team will now be reserved for Lions tours of the Southern Hemisphere.

A 2015 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia was approved by the RLIF however the Australians wanted to have a year off before the 2016 Four Nations.

===2019 return===
In May 2017, it was confirmed that Great Britain would tour the southern hemisphere in 2019, with New Zealand and Australia touring Europe in 2018 and 2020 respectively.

The 2019 Great Britain Lions tour began with a 14–6 loss against Tonga. They would go on to lose their following two tour matches against New Zealand before suffering a fourth loss to Papua New Guinea. After the tour had concluded, several of the Great Britain players and head coach Wayne Bennett came under intense media scrutiny and fan backlash. Several commentators argued the team should be disbanded due to the lack of fan interest and players from countries other than England. Kevin Sinfield of the RFL noted that &quot;maybe the appetite isn’t quite what it was made out to be – and that will be part of the post-tour review.&quot;

===2024 planned return===
In 2024, the RFL considered the return of the Great Britain team for 2025 return of The Ashes, and future away tours. However, in September of that year, the governing body confirmed during the new kit launch that England would continue the 2025 tour as planned.

== Team image ==
===Kit===

The team was originally known as the &quot;Northern Union XIII&quot; in reference to the name of the sport&#x27;s governing body. After 1922 the name &quot;the Lions&quot; was first used. In 1948 the team became known as &quot;Great Britain&quot; for the Ashes Series. During the 1990s the Rugby Football League expanded this to &quot;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;, and the jersey bore the name &quot;British Isles XIII&quot;, despite the fact that the entire island is represented by a separate team. In 2004 the words &quot;...and Northern Ireland&quot; were dropped from the title, though the Irish shamrock continued to form part of the RFL&#x27;s crest and &quot;British Isles XIII&quot; remained on the jersey, even though Ireland is still represented by their own team. At matches, the team was represented by the Union Flag and the singing of God Save the Queen, both symbols of the United Kingdom. The practice of a UK-wide team being called &quot;Great Britain&quot; has a precedent with the Great British Olympic team, though the formal name of the Olympic team includes &quot;and Northern Ireland&quot;.

<doc id="951950" wikidata="Q1926346" url="?curid=951950" title="Meyer v. Nebraska">
<text>Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court that held that the &quot;Siman Act&quot;, a 1919 Nebraska law prohibiting minority languages as both the subject and medium of instruction in schools, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court&#x27;s ruling is one of the earliest articulations of substantive due process.

The Siman Act had been passed after World War I as part of the English only movement and during a time of pervasive anti-German sentiment, atrocity propaganda, and spy scare paranoia promoted by U.S. news media. Nebraska was one of 22 states that had enacted laws banning or restricting foreign language instruction based on broader nativist sentiments to promote assimilation into American culture and society.

The Supreme Court, while recognizing that states have significant power to &quot;make reasonable regulations for all schools&quot;, invalidated the Siman Act as an excessive &quot;interference&quot; of liberties granted by the Fourteenth Amendment, such as the right of a teacher to instruct students and the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children. The Court also noted that such rights extend broadly to all Americans, including those who speak foreign languages.

&quot;Meyer&quot; has been described by legal scholars as &quot;the case that defined personal liberties&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s First Privacy Case&quot;, since it greatly expanded the scope of constitutionally protected liberties to include both enumerated and unenumerated &quot;fundamental rights&quot; such as the right &quot;to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, [and] to marry, establish a home and bring up children...&quot;. This subsequently developed into the legal principle of substantive due process that would underpin decisions related to same-sex marriage, racial discrimination, and reproductive rights.

==Context and legislation==
World War I witnessed an extensive campaign against all things German, such as the performance of German music at symphony concerts and the meetings of German American civic associations. Language was a principal focus of legislation at the state and local level. It took many forms, from requiring associations to have charters written in English to a ban on the use of German within the town limits. Some states banned foreign language instruction, while a few banned only German. Some extended their bans into private instruction and even to religious education. A bill to create a Department of Education at the federal level was introduced in October 1918, designed to restrict federal funds to states that enforced English-only education. An internal battle over conducting services and religious instruction in German divided the Lutheran churches.

On April 9, 1919, Nebraska enacted a statute called &quot;An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska&quot;, commonly known as the Siman Act. It imposed restrictions on both the use of a foreign language as a medium of instruction and on foreign languages as a subject of study. With respect to the use of a foreign language while teaching, it provided that &quot;No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language.&quot; With respect to foreign-language education, it prohibited instruction of children who had yet to successfully complete the eighth grade.

==Facts and arguments==
On May 25, 1920, Robert T. Meyer, while an instructor in Zion Lutheran School, a one-room schoolhouse in Hampton, Nebraska, taught the subject of reading in the German language to 10-year-old Raymond Parpart, a fourth grader. The Hamilton County Attorney entered the classroom and discovered Parpart reading from the Bible in German. He charged Meyer with violating the Siman Act.

Meyer was tried and convicted in the district court for Hamilton County and fined $25 (about $ in dollars). The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed his conviction by a vote of 4 to 2. The majority thought the law a proper response to &quot;the baneful effects&quot; of allowing immigrants to educate their children in their mother tongue, with results &quot;inimical to our own safety&quot;. The dissent called the Siman Act the work of &quot;crowd psychology&quot;.

Meyer appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. His lead attorney was Arthur Mullen, an Irish-Catholic and a prominent Democrat who had earlier failed in his attempt to obtain an injunction against enforcement of the Siman Act from the Nebraska State Supreme Court. Oral arguments expressed conflicting interpretations of the World War I experience. Mullen attributed the law to &quot;hatred, national bigotry and racial prejudice engendered by the World War&quot;. Opposing counsel countered that &quot;it is the ambition of the State to have its entire population 100 percent American&quot;.

==Majority opinion==

The Supreme Court reversed seven to two, reasoning that although the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause ostensibly mandates only that the government follow certain &quot;procedures&quot; before depriving individuals of life, liberty or property (such as a jury trial in criminal cases), the concept of &quot;liberty thus guaranteed&quot; is broader and includes certain spheres of life in which the government cannot intrude even if properly applies such procedures. 

Writing for the majority, Justice McReynolds stated that while it was not necessary &quot;to define with exactness&quot; the liberties that were protected by the Due Process Clause, its protections &quot;[w]ithout doubt&quot; not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men&quot;.

Analyzing in that context the liberty of the teacher and of parents with respect to their children, McReynolds wrote: &quot;Practically, education of the young is only possible in schools conducted by especially qualified persons who devote themselves thereto. The calling always has been regarded as useful and honorable, essential, indeed, to the public welfare. Mere knowledge of the German language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful. Heretofore it has been commonly looked upon as helpful and desirable. Plaintiff in error taught this language in school as part of his occupation. His right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children, we think, are within the liberty of the amendment.&quot; And further: &quot;Evidently the Legislature has attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own.&quot;

And finally: &quot;That the state may do much, go very far, indeed, in order to improve the quality of its citizens, physically, mentally and morally, is clear; but the individual has certain fundamental rights which must be respected. The protection of the Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue. Perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution – a desirable end cannot be promoted by prohibited means.&quot;

He allowed that wartime circumstances might justify a different understanding, but that Nebraska had not demonstrated sufficient need &quot;in time of peace and domestic tranquility&quot; to justify &quot;the consequent infringement of rights long freely enjoyed&quot;.

==Dissent==
Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and George Sutherland dissented. Their dissenting opinion, written by Holmes, is found in the companion case of &quot;Bartels v. State of Iowa&quot;. Holmes wrote that he differed with the majority &quot;with hesitation and unwillingness&quot; because he thought the law did not impose an undue restriction on the liberty of the teacher since it was not arbitrary, was limited in its application to the teaching of children, and the State had areas where many children might hear only a language other than English spoken at home. &quot;I think I appreciate the objection to the law, but it appears to me to present a question upon which men reasonably might differ and therefore I am unable to say the Constitution of the United States prevents the experiment being tried.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
The most immediate significance of &quot;Meyer&quot; was in derailing the powerful nationwide movement, motivated largely by anti-Catholicism, to destroy parochial education by requiring all children to attend public schools. Oregon voters approved one such compulsory public education law in a referendum seven months before &quot;Meyer&quot;, and similar measures. The Court unanimously struck down the Oregon law in &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot; (1925), which was based largely upon &quot;Meyer. Pierce&quot; even more forcefully emphasized parental rights: &quot;The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.&quot;

Two years later, the Court reaffirmed the holdings of &quot;Meyer&quot; and &quot;Pierce&quot; in &quot;Farrington v. Tokushige&quot; (1927), which invalidated a Hawaiian statute restricting the teaching of Asian languages. The Court rejected the Hawaiian territory&#x27;s attempt to distinguish &quot;Meyer&quot; on the basis that Asian languages were more pernicious than German.

==Influence on later jurisprudence==

&quot;Meyer&quot;, along with &quot;Pierce,&quot; is often cited as one of the first instances in which the U.S. Supreme Court engaged in substantive due process in the area of civil liberties. Laurence Tribe has called them &quot;the two sturdiest pillars of the substantive due process temple&quot;. He noted that the decisions in these cases did not describe specific acts as constitutionally protected but a broader area of liberty: &quot;[they] described what they were protecting from the standardizing hand of the state in language that spoke of the family as a center of value-formation and value-transmission ... the authority of parents to make basic choices&quot; and not just controlling the subjects one&#x27;s child is taught. The doctrine of substantive due process provided the basis for future civil rights decisions of the Court, including &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, and &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;. 

Justice Kennedy speculated in 2000 that both of those cases might have been written differently nowadays: &quot;&quot;Pierce&quot; and &quot;Meyer&quot;, had they been decided in recent times, may well have been grounded upon First Amendment principles protecting freedom of speech, belief, and religion.&quot;

<text>Wilhelm Heinrich Ackermann (25 June 1789, Auerbach, Saxony – 27 March 1848, Frankfurt) was a German teacher.

His father was higher priest in Auerbach, his two brothers worked as councillor in Dresden and as priest in Syrau. Wilhelm Ackermann learned on the college of Gotha, then beginning in 1807 studied theology in Leipzig. During his studies, he began teaching and found his vocation therein.

Asked by his uncle Rudolph Ackermann, a merchant from London, he began in 1811 to teach young Englishmen with whom he stayed for two years with the Swiss pedagogue Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi in Yverdon-les-Bains. Ackermann said he was &quot;learning daily from the ingenious old man, so plenty of inspirations&quot;.

In 1813 he entered the Freikorps of baron Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow in an enthusiasm to free his fatherland. He served as rifleman and became officer on 26 August. On the same day Karl Theodor Körner fell. Ackermann and other officers dug the grave of their friend under an oak in Wöbbelin. During the Battle of the Göhrde, he captured a cannon and received the Iron cross of honour. He accompanied the corps until Paris.

After the peace treaty of 1814, Ackermann went to London where he worked as correspondent for the companies of his uncle. In winter, he travelled to Germany, where he visited the house of Theodor Körner. In London, he kept company with the teacher of elocution Alexander Graham Bell, whose rather passive teaching system contrasted with the tenets of Pestalozzi followed by Ackermann. Beginning in 1815, he travelled again to Ifferten with five pupils, and Dr. Bell followed soon. All attempts to convince Dr. Bell from the side of Pestalozzi and Ackermann remained fruitless. In the following years, Ackermann travels with his pupils or stays at friendly institutes.

In 1819, he reaches Frankfurt, where he accepts a regular teaching position at the &quot;Musterschule&quot; (4 July 1820), where he preferred to teach history and German. While there, he stood up for religious and political freedom, restricted by the resolutions of 28 June 1823. He remained in office until the end of the year 1847, when he retired with chest troubles.

Ackermann never married.

<doc id="951957" wikidata="Q934071" url="?curid=951957" title="Sailing at the 1908 Summer Olympics">
<text>Sailing/Yachting is an Olympic sport starting from the Games of the 1st Olympiad (1896 Olympics in Athens, Greece). With the exception of the 1904 and the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule.
The Sailing program of 1908 was open for a total of five sailing classes (disciplines), but actually only four Sailing events were contested. The planned venue of all races, named &quot;matches&quot;, was Ryde, Isle of Wight.

== Venue ==


At the 1907 The Hague Conference of the IOC Ryde at the Isle of Wight was appointed to host the sailing regattas, for all classes, of the games of the IVth Olympiad. However, when there were only two British entries for the 12 Metre matches, and both yacht were located at the Firth of Clyde, the decision was made to use Hunters Quay as a second venue.

=== Royal Victoria Yacht Club, Ryde ===
The RVYC was founded on 24 May 1845 by Prince Albert to give Queen Victoria a Yacht Club which she was entitled to enter as a mere female!

For the Olympic matches the race committee used the available shipping buoys as marks for the courses. for the classes the following course lengths were used:
* 6 Metre: 
* 7 Metre: 
* 8 Metre: 

=== Clyde Corinthian Yacht Club, Hunters Quay ===
* 12 Metre: 

=== Course areas ===
The following course areas were used during the 1908 Olympic sailing regattas:

=== Overview ===

A maximum of 2 boats per country per class was allowed.

Although one of the oldest organized sporting activities, sailing in the early first part of the 20th century was not uniformly organized. This had a lot to do with national traditions as well as with the fact that there were no standardized boat types with uniform building instructions and measurements. Also a lot of development was done in the area of boat design and boat building. The shape of a boat, specifically its length, its weight and its sail area, are major parameters that determine the boat&#x27;s speed. Several initiatives were started to create a formula that made it possible to have boats race each other without having to calculate the final result. But the different countries initially could not agree on an international system. At the Olympics of 1900 it was clear that sailing was not ready for international competition, and something had to be done.

In 1906 international meetings were organize to solve the problem. Finally in Paris, October 1907 the first International Rule was ratified. Delegates from this meeting went on to form the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU), the precursor to the present International Sailing Federation (ISAF).

The agreed formula gives a result in meters (Metre). During the meeting in 1907 the IOC made the decision to open the 1908 Summer Olympics for the following Metre classes:

== Notes ==
* This Olympic sailing event was gender independent, however only two women, Frances Rivett-Carnac in the 7 Metre, and the Duchess of Westminster as extra on her 8 Metre, participated. The duchess of Westminster also distributed the diplomas of special merit to the competitors of the other Olympic sports on 25 July 1908. Gender specific events however had to wait until 1988.
* The matches at Ryde were held in light air conditions.
* All members of a team had to be a citizen of the country they represent. However the boats used did not have to be built in the same country that the team was representing since the Olympic games are considered a test of skills and handling for the team and not a test of the yacht. This in contrast with the matches for the America&#x27;s cup of that time.
* A second 7 Metre yacht &quot;Mignonette&quot; was entered under command of Capt. R. Sloane-Stanley but failed to make it to the starting line.
* At the end of the official report the following suggestion was made: It has been suggested that in the yacht racing of future Olympic Games it might be better to select a fleet of &quot;one-design&quot; boats in the waters where the Games are held, and let all the crews entered draw lots for them every day, with the proviso that no crew should have the same boat twice. Sailing had to wait until 1920 before the first &quot;one-design&quot; class was selected for the Games.

== Other information ==
During the Sailing regattas at the 1908 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:
* , Johan Anker, Multiple Olympic competitor and designer of many Metre yachts as well as the 1948 Olympic Dragon, in the 8 Metre &quot;Fram&quot;
* , Duchess of Westminster as owner and extra crewmember of the 8 Metre &quot;Sorais&quot;
* , William Dudley Ward in the 8 Metre &quot;Sorais&quot;
* , Harald Wallin in &quot;Vinga&quot;

<text>Pascual Boing is a Mexican soft drink maker mostly known for its fruit flavored beverages marketed under the Pascual, Boing! and Lulú brands. The enterprise was begun in 1940 and successfully held against the entrance of foreign competitors in the Mexican market. However, continued labor disputes led to a strike in 1982, which ended in 1985 with the workers obtaining the right to take over the company, running it as a cooperative. Since then, it has remained a profitable business although it has lost market share in Mexico, due to competition from Coca-Cola and Pepsi. This has prompted the company to protest unfair practices which exclude it from retail venues as well as look abroad to new markets, especially in the United States. it is also one of the sponsors for many Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide&#x27;s shows

== History ==
The company was originally a private enterprise, started in 1940 by Rafael Victor Jiménez Zamudo. In the 1960s, Jíménez began using tetra paks and acquired its Northern plant from Canada Dry, along with a franchise to produce and market these products. From its beginnings to the early 1980s, the company had tremendous growth with Jiménez very successful in the face of competition from multinational corporations. Two plants were opened in the 1960s. In 1980, the company was fourth in the soft drink market in Mexico. However, the working conditions at the plants were exploitative, with workers obligated to work overtime without pay increases. There had been several attempts to organize workers at the plant due to abuses, but management fired organizers.

In March 1982, the Mexican federal government decreed that all workers, including those in private companies, receive thirty percent wage increases because of the devaluation of the peso. However, Jiménez refused the increase, stating that he could not afford it. Several political activists organized the workers to protest and as 150 workers were fired for participating, all the workers went on strike on May 18, 1982, shutting down operations. On May 31, Jiménez and others confronted the striking workers at the plant in Colonia Tránsito. Violence broke out and two strikers were killed, with seventeen wounded. Jiménez was formally accused of murder but was not prosecuted.

The work stoppage went on for three years. At one point, workers took over the federal arbitration offices, and a formal committee to represent the workers was formed. They gained legal recognition as well a public support for their cause. In 1983, the courts found in favor of the workers in litigation against the company and in 1984, workers met with President Miguel de la Madrid . Jiménez declared the company bankrupt and tried to sell the facilities. However, the workers and federal authorities worked out an arrangement that the workers would take over the company entirely, including facilities and brand. A cooperative called the Sociedad Cooperativa Trabajadores de Pascual S.C.L. was formed on May 27, 1985.

After years of being idle, the new worker/owners needed about 1.5 million dollars to restart operations. During the strike, over 320 painters sided with the workers including Rufino Tamayo, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Francisco Toledo, Felipe Ehrenberg, Carolia Paniagua, José Chávez Morado, Alfredo Zalce, Guillermo Ceniceros and José Luis Cuevas as well as the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana and Taller de Gráfica Popular by donating artworks to auction off. There were two small auctions but the money being raised was not sufficient and the continued selling of the artworks became difficult. Instead, the main union of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México provided the funds needed to obtain permits and service the machinery. The remaining painting remained with the company and in 1991 an entity called the Fundación Cultural Trabajadores de Pascual y del Arte, A. C. was created for their care and promotion.

The new cooperative has had multiple struggles since it was created. The start of the cooperative was rocky with internal struggles among the workers as to how to organize and operate. However, operations as a cooperative began on November 27, 1985 with workers receiving their first share of profits in May 1986. The former owner, Jiménez, lost the legal right to use the name Pascual Boing but nonetheless was doing so from a plant in Aguascalientes until cooperative representative negotiated a deal.

Another ongoing problem is that the land on which the original factories are located did not belong to the original company but rather to the owner&#x27;s wife, Victoria Valdez. She was allowed to sue the cooperative in 1989 and won the case in 2003, with the court ordering Pascual off the land. At this point, then Mexico City mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, expropriated the land from Valdez to give to Pascual. However, in 2005, the Supreme Court decreed this expropriation to be illegal, since it did not benefit the public but a private company that produced a non-essential product.

Pascual does not see itself as a private, for-profit company; they claim that being worker-owned, they perform a social function and as such expropriation in their favor is for public benefit. Since their founding, they have received vocal and political support from the PRD, intellectuals, writers such as Elena Poniatowska, college students and those opposed to globalization .

Despite its problems, the cooperative has grown, opening major processing plants in San Juan del Río, Querétaro in 1992, one in Tizayuca, Hidalgo in 2003 and another in Culiacán, Sinaloa in 2006. In the 2000s, it has also been working on markets in the United States and elsewhere, eyeing northern areas nearer the border such as Ciudad Acuña to facilitate export and in 2011 a freezing and bottling plant was begun in Anáhuac, Nuevo León . Despite its growth, the cooperative has had to rebut assertions that it is going broke. For example, in 2007, the company had to deny a chain email stating that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and to buy the product to save the company.

Today, Pascual Boing is the only remaining wholly Mexican owned major soft drink bottler. The company employs over 5,000 people and generates over 22,000 jobs indirectly, benefitting more than 50,000 families. Part of the enterprise&#x27;s mission is to show that employee ownership as a cooperative can work. The organization of the cooperative consists of a General Assembly of founders and other partners, followed several boards including Corporate/Investment, Administration, Oversight and the Cultural Foundation. Under these are four commissions called Education, Social Outlook, Arbitration and Technical Control. It is also dedicated to a sense of social responsibility. It has been recognized by the Secretaría del Trabajo as a &quot;clean industry&quot; . In 2003, the company partnered with the federal government to circulate information about the prevention or kidnapping of children which included announcements on Pascual Boing trucks and materials for schools.

==Products and production==

The company sells fruit juice, nectars, concentrates, carbonated beverages, bottled water and milk. It is best known for its fruit flavored drinks such as guava, mango, tamarind, strawberry, apple, pineapple, soursop, grape, lime, grapefruit and peach under the Boing! Lulú and Pascual brands. Other brands include PulpaMex, Woopy, Leche Pascual, Nectasis and Pascuatin.

All of the processing of their products is done by Pascual. Pascual uses real sugar in their products as opposed to fructose although the former is more expensive. It obtains its sugar from the Sociedad Cooperativa Trabajadores del Ingenio Puruarán in Michoacán, purchasing 100% of the annual production. They also use real fruit such as mangos from Veracruz and Guerrero, strawberries from Guanajuato and apples from Puebla along with natural colorings.

The company has nineteen facilities and thirty production lines, capable of producing 120 tons of fruit pulp and 470,970 cases of finished product in three shifts with an annual capacity of fifty million cases of finished product per year. It has two main processing plants Planta San Juan del Río in Querétaro and Planta Tizayuca in Hidalgo. The Tizayuca plant produces about a billion liters of juice a year and employs about 900 people, working at only sixty percent of capacity. In 2011 the company invested about 25 million pesos to expand the Tizayuca plant. As part of its expansion northward, a smaller plant was built in Anáhuac, Nuevo León.

==Marketing and distribution==
Most of Pascuals’ products are marketed on the Boing!, Pascual and Lulú brands. While its products can be found in all of Mexico, distribution is concentrated in the center and northeast of the country, with the Mexico City area accounting for sixty percent of sales. There are a total of 1048 distribution centers. It has 19 wholly owned distributors along with 27 major independent distributors in Acapulco, Aguascalientes, Mexico City, Ciudad Madero, Cuernavaca, Guadalajara, Iguala, León, Monterrey, Morelia, Pachuca, Poza Rica, Puebla, Querétaro, Río Blanco, San Luis Potosí and Toluca . In the center of the country, Pascual products are widely found in smaller grocery stores, restaurants and semi-fixed street stands, which account for about half of its sales. Delivery of products is mostly handled by an outside cooperative of truckers.

Pascual Boing is a major exporter of soft drinks in Mexico along with Arca. In 2008, the exported about 1.5 million of the 50 million cases of beverages it produced. It exports to the U.S., Canada, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago, with exports to China and South America beginning in 2012.

Its largest export market is the United States, concentrated in Texas, Chicago, North Carolina, Florida and California, where it targets the Hispanic market looking for something from home. As of 2011, sales were about 150,000 cases. NAFTA has helped with the lowering of tariffs, making the products more competitive. Pascual Boing began in small Hispanic groceries and is working to expand into major supermarkets but this has been difficult because it does not spend as much on marketing as other soft drink producers. However, the US export market is growing and in the 2000s it began constructing facilities in border areas in order to facilitate export to the United States.

Much of the push to develop foreign markets for Pascual Boing products has come from competition inside Mexico from multinational companies. Pascual Boing has accused makers such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi of monopolistic practices aimed at excluding the Mexican bottlers from retail venues such as small groceries, school cafeterias and public events. Pascual Boing used to have a fifty percent share in Mexico but this has shrunk to fifteen percent. Today, Coca-Cola and its bottlers control over 75% of the Mexican soft drink market. Pascual Boing accuses Coca-Cola and Pepsi of making outlets sign exclusivity agreements, so that they cannot sell Pascual products. For example, Pascual is excluded from about twenty percent of school campuses in the state of Hidalgo. In 2010, Pascual workers closed the Mexico City-Pachuca highway to demand that federal and state authorities do something against these tactics.

==Logo==

The company has had a long-standing dispute with Walt Disney over its duck logo, adopted in the 1940s. The logo was based on Donald Duck including a sailors cap and named Pato Pascual (Pascual Duck). This version can still be found in some places. In the 1980s, Disney sued, leading to some minor changes in the logo. In the 2000s, Disney complained again that the logo looked too much like Donald Duck. In 2007, it was changed again, with the current version having a rapper look with ruffled feathers and a baseball cap turned backwards.

==Fundación Pascual==

During the strike of 1982–1985, workers were supported by over 320 artists. After the workers won the right to take over the company, these artists along with the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana and Taller de Gráfica Popular began a project to auction donated works to raise the money needed to restart the idle plants. The project gathered 524 works of art. However, most of the donated paintings were not sold for various reasons ending with the obtaining of the needed money from the main union of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.

The new workers’ cooperative offered to return the works to the artists but most preferred that they remained with the organization. From 1985 to 1991, the collection increased to almost one thousand pieces due to continued donations. In 1991, the cooperative created the Fundación Cultural de Trabajadores de Pascual to care and promote the collection.

<text>Glenlivet () is a glen in the Highlands of Scotland through which the River Livet flows.

The river rises high in the Ladder Hills and flows past several distileries and hamlets and then onto the Bridgend before joining the River Avon, one of the main tributaries of the River Spey. Glenlivet is known for the Glenlivet Estate and the whisky The Glenlivet. The Battle of Glenlivet was fought on the hillsides of the glen in 1594.

==Etymology==

According to the Cairngorm National Park Authority the river takes its name from Gaelic meaning &quot;shining or flooding one&quot;. William J. Watson, whilst confirming the Gaelic , understood the derivation to be similar to that of Glen Lyon with the root meaning being &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;polish&quot;. A similar suggestion by Ross is that Livet may be derived from the + meaning &quot;slippery&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot; + &quot;place&quot; Nicolaisen suggested that it is either an early Gaelic or pre-Gaelic name meaning &quot;full of water&quot; or &quot;floody&quot;.

==Geography and history==

No part of Glenlivet is lower than above sea level. The River Livet rises in the Ladder Hills east of Tomintoul  and to the north of Strathdon. It begins when various small streams coalesce including the Back Burn and the Kymah Burn, below the summits of Carn an t-Suidhe and Carn na Bruar at roughly above sea level. The river is then joined by the Blye Water that descends from near the summit of Càrn Mòr. The next watercourse to join the river is the Crombie Water. The upper reaches of the Crombie are the location of the cottage of Scalan. Now a museum, this was the site of the 18th century College of Scalan, which was a hidden Catholic seminary during the anti-Catholic persecutions of the time. Downstream from Scalan is the settlement of Braes of Glenlivet, the location of the Braeval distillery. Below the distillery the Crombie Water rounds the prominent hill of The Bochel and then joins the River Livet.

Less than a kilometre from this confluence is the hamlet of Tomnavoulin which hosts the Tamnavulin distillery. Further downstream the river is joined from the east by the Burn of Nevie. The name &#x27;Nevie&#x27; may be derived from and indicate a sacred place of the pre-Christian Celtic culture. Just west of Bridge of Nevie was a medieval church building known as Chapel Christ. By 1869 all trace of the structure had disappeared. Further downstream on the west bank of the river is The Glenlivet distillery owned by the Chivas Brothers that sells more than a million cases per annum.

Next, the Burn of Tervie flows down from Ben Rinnes to the east just below the distillery. The Battle of Glenlivet was fought on a hillside between the Burn of Nevie and the Burn of Tervie in October 1594. This was fought between a Protestant advance force loyal to King James VI who were commanded by Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll (then a teenager), against Catholic forces commanded by George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly, and Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll. The Catholics won the day decisively but &quot;fled before the following forces of the King&quot;.

The River Livet flows from the vicinity of the battle and on to Bridgend of Glenlivet, passing under the remains of an 18th-century bridge before joining the River Avon (pronounced A&#x27;an).

In the 21st century, Glenlivet is a community council area in Moray that encompasses the glen itself plus some surrounding settlements and historic parishes such as Tomintoul, Ballindalloch, Inveravon and Kirkmichael.

==Estate==
The Glenlivet Estate is part of Crown Estate Scotland.

For about 500 years until the early 20th Century, the estate belonged to the family of the Dukes of Gordon and the Duke of Richmond. The Crown Estate acquired the property of in 1937, which today has over 30 farms, of commercial forests and substantial moorland. The estate, part of which is in Strath A&#x27;an, operates a ranger service and visitor centre and has a network of walking trails.

<text>Kennington Park is a public park in Kennington, south London and lies between Kennington Park Road and St. Agnes Place. It was opened in 1854 on the site of what had been Kennington Common, where the Chartists gathered for their biggest &quot;monster rally&quot; on 10 April 1848. Soon after this demonstration the common was enclosed and, sponsored by the royal family, made into a public park.

Kennington Common was a site of public executions until 1800 as well as being an area for public speaking. Some of the most illustrious orators to speak here were Methodist founders George Whitefield and John Wesley who is reputed to have attracted a crowd of 30,000.

The common was one of the earliest London cricket venues and is known to have been used for top-class matches in 1724. Kennington Park hosts the first inner London community cricket ground, sponsored by Surrey County Cricket Club whose home, The Oval, is close to the park. Casual games of both cricket and football are regularly held in the park.

In the 1970s, the old tradition of mass gatherings returned to the park which was host to the start of many significant marches to Parliament. Today, a number of commercial and community events are held in the park each year and recently the Flower Garden was restored with a Heritage Lottery grant. The Friends of Kennington Park, FoKP, was founded in 2002 and provides a local forum for park issues as well as fundraising for improvements.

==Kennington Common==

===Before 1600===

Although there are no available written records of the area before 1600, analysis of the area&#x27;s archaeology and landscape reveals its earlier history. Recently discovered post stumps in the south Thames foreshore near Vauxhall Bridge point to a ritual jetty or possibly the first London bridge, by the outlet of the River Effra, from around 1500 BC. The Effra formed the southerly boundary to the common.

Three closely related geographic features defined the area of Kennington Common as sacred in ancient times: the sharp bend in the river Effra before it flowed into the Thames, a strategic mound or tumulus, and an important fork in the main road from the river crossing which is now known as London Bridge. This made it a sacred place of &#x27;national&#x27; assembly which may have related to the jetty or bridge. The mound may have also been used by the locals of the South London marsh community as a refuge from tidal flash floods. As the flood water receded, the river silt left a level field which was ideal for grazing animals or playing team ball games.

===17th century===
* 1600 gives the first record of the common. &quot;The common was bounded on the South West by Vauxhall Creek&quot; It seems that the common extended over marshy land to the South West of the Roman Road Stane Street, now Kennington Park Road. When the common became bounded by the Kennington Park Road is not known. There is a 1660 record of a common keeper being paid for grazing.
* 1661 The famous Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens are laid out nearby.
* 1678 First recorded execution at Kennington Common was that of Sarah Elston who was burnt for murdering her husband on 24 April. Kennington Common was the South London equivalent of Tyburn (now Marble Arch).
* 1678 John Masters and Gabriel Dean, highwaymen, executed on 24 April.
* 1679 Dorothy Lillingstone was executed for murder on 7 April.
* 1685 William Disney was executed for High Treason on 29 June.

===18th century===
&quot;During the holiday season, Kennington Common in the last (18th) century was an epitome of &quot;Bartlemy Fair&quot;, with booths, tents, caravans, and scaffolds, surmounted by flags. It also had one peculiarity, for, as we learn from &quot;Merrie England in the Olden Time&quot;, it was a favourite spot for merryandrews, and other buffooneries in open rivalry, and competition with field-preachers and ranters. It was here that Mr. Maw-worm encountered the brickbats of his congregation, and had his &quot;pious tail&quot; illuminated with the squibs and crackers of the unregenerate.&quot;
* 1724 London v Dartford is the earliest known cricket match on Kennington Common
* 1725 First record of the Green Man and Horns Tavern near Kennington Common. The cricket played on the common used the Horns as a base. Also other sports including quoits and bowling were played.
* 1739 Methodists John Wesley and George Whitefield preach to 30,000. Whitefield is remembered in the nearby &#x27;Whitefield House&#x27; home of the Evangelical Alliance. Dissenting Methodists, such as the son of a slave Robert Wedderburn, spoke in a more radical voice on Kennington Common speaking out against the enclosures and slavery (active from 1786 through 1813). Kennington Common was a key South London place for public speaking, acting as a kind of open air free university of the day.
* 1739 John Hannah executed for robbery and perjury.
* 1743 James Hunt and Thomas Collins hanged for sodomy at Kennington Common gallows.
* 1746 Col. Francis Towneley and eight men of the Manchester Regiment who had taken part in the Jacobite rising were hanged, drawn and quartered on 30 July.
* 1749 Richard Coleman executed &quot;for a murder he did not commit&quot; on 12 April.
* 1751 A road was &quot;cut through gardens 80-foot wide&quot; from Kennington Common to Westminster Bridge. (&quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; Monday 16 December 1751). The road is Kennington Road and comes up to the common next to the Horns tavern.
* 1767 The common was flooded by a high tide coming up Vauxhall Creek.
* 1785 Last known use of the Common as a venue for first-class cricket.
* 1790 William Blake moved to North Lambeth and may have attended commons meetings in the 1790s, in all likelihood with Thomas Paine.
* 1792 Mungo, a black prize fighter breaks the jaw of his opponent, a carpenter, in a boxing match on the common. (Peter Linebaugh &quot;The London Hanged&quot; Verso 2003 p. 414)
* 1795 Lewis Jeremiah Avershaw an infamous highwayman, was executed for shooting a Peace Officer on 3 August.
* 1799 The last person to be hanged at the common (six years after public execution was ended at Tyburn) was a fraudster from nearby Camberwell by the name Badger.
* &quot;The Gymnastic Society&quot; met regularly at Kennington Common during the second half of the eighteenth century to play football The Society – arguably the world&#x27;s first football club – consisted of London-based natives of Cumberland and Westmoreland.

===19th century===
* 1800 The much-respected Mr. Briant becomes landlord of the Horns runs a famous Glee Club. Briant died 1852 but his relatives still live in Kennington, one of whom chaired the Parks Management Advisory Committee in 1996.
* 1815 In February, a mob breaks windows &#x27;round the Horns&#x27;. LifeGuards called out to quell the mob. The Riot Act was read. In 1819 The Peterloo Massacre signalled an end to repression by violence.
* 1818 Camberwell New Road is built running east/west, cutting the southern corner of the common off from the rest of it.
* 1824 St. Mark&#x27;s Church by D. R. Roper, built on an enclosed corner of the common, over the river Effra. Promoted by the Church of England as the &#x27;salvation of the common&#x27;, twenty four years later it was the vicar of this church who led the move to enclose the whole common.
* 1832 First Reform Act, after which hustings were set up on Kennington Common (outside The Horns).
* 1845 Surrey County Cricket Club formed (22 August formally constituted on 18 October) at the Horns.

* 1848 10 April Chartist mass meeting organised by Black Briton and leader of London Chartists William Cuffay. Chartism was a federation of different groups who had agreed on a set of political demands for an inclusive people&#x27;s democracy. Chartism was the first British national working class organisation. 1848 was known as the Year of Revolutions.

<text>The Baltimore riot of 1861 (also called the &quot;Pratt Street Riots&quot; and the &quot;Pratt Street Massacre&quot;) was a civil conflict on Friday, April 19, 1861, on Pratt Street, Baltimore, Maryland. It occurred between antiwar &quot;Copperhead&quot; Democrats (the largest party in Maryland) and other Confederate sympathizers on one side, and on the other, members of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania state militia regiments en route to the national capital at Washington who had been called up for federal service. The fighting began at the President Street Station, spreading throughout President Street and subsequently to Howard Street, where it ended at the Camden Street Station. The riot produced the first deaths of Union volunteers by hostile action, although caused by civilians, in the American Civil War. Civilians among the attackers also were killed.

==Background==
In 1861, many Baltimoreans did not support a violent conflict with their southern neighbors and some of them strongly sympathized with the Southern cause. Historian David J. Eicher described Baltimore in 1861 as &quot;the largely pro-Southern city of Baltimore&quot;. In the previous year&#x27;s presidential election, Abraham Lincoln had received only 1,100 of more than 30,000 votes cast in the city. Lincoln&#x27;s opponents were infuriated (and supporters disappointed) when the president-elect, fearing an infamous rumored assassination plot, traveled secretly through the city in the middle of the night on a different railroad protected by a few aides and detectives including the soon-to-be famous Allan Pinkerton in February en route to his inauguration (then constitutionally scheduled for March 4) in Washington, D.C. The city was also home to the country&#x27;s largest population (25,000) of free African Americans, as well as many white abolitionists and supporters of the Union. As the war began, the city&#x27;s divided loyalties created tension. Supporters of secession and slavery organized themselves into a force called &quot;National Volunteers&quot; while Unionists and abolitionists called themselves &quot;Minute Men&quot;.

The conflict at Fort Sumter had occurred on April 12–13, one week before the riot. At the time, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas had not yet seceded from the U.S. In fact, prior to Lincoln&#x27;s demand for 75,000 soldiers with which to invade the South, Virginia, North Carolina, and Arkansas had elected secession delegations which had voted to remain in the Union and Tennessee had held a referendum of the people to determine whether or not to elect a secession delegation, and had voted by about 2/3 majority to not even consider the matter. The other slave states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as Missouri and Kentucky (later known as &quot;border states&quot;) were in flux. When Fort Sumter fell on April 13, President Lincoln sent telegraphs followed by letters to the all the governors of states that had not seceded, calling for 75,000 troops with which to re-possess U.S. property in the South. After receiving this communication, the Governor of Virginia directed Virginia&#x27;s Secession Delegation to reconvene. Just nine days earlier, On April 4, 1861, Virginia&#x27;s secession delegation had voted to stand with the Union by a vote of 90 to 45. However, in light of the call for troops, Virginia&#x27;s Secession Delegation did meet once more and took another vote. On April 17, the new vote was 85 to 55 that Virginia would secede, with the condition that a referendum of the people would be held and secession would only occur if the people confirmed the vote of the Delegation.

Virginia&#x27;s secession was particularly significant due to the state&#x27;s industrial capacity. Sympathetic Marylanders, who had supported secession ever since John C. Calhoun spoke of nullification, agitated to join Virginia in leaving the Union. Their discontent increased in the days afterward when Lincoln put out a call for volunteers to serve 90 days and end the insurrection.

New militia units from several Northern states were starting to move south, particularly to protect Washington, D.C., from the new Confederate threat in Virginia. Baltimore&#x27;s newly elected reform mayor, George William Brown, and the new police marshal (chief), George Proctor Kane, anticipated trouble and began efforts to placate the city&#x27;s population.

On Thursday, April 18, 460 newly mustered Pennsylvania state militia volunteers (generally from the Pottsville, Pennsylvania area) arrived from the state capital at Harrisburg on the Northern Central Railway at its Bolton Street Station (off present-day North Howard Street  — across the street from the present site of the Fifth Regiment Armory of the Maryland National Guard, built 1900). They were joined by several regiments of regular United States Army troops under John C. Pemberton (later the Confederate general and commander at the siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, whose surrender in July 1863 resulted in the first split of the Confederacy) returning from duty on the western frontier. They split off from Howard Street in downtown Baltimore and marched east along the waterfront to Fort McHenry and reported for duty there. Seven hundred &quot;National Volunteers&quot; of Southern sympathizers rallied at the Washington Monument and traveled to the station to confront the combined units of troops, which unbeknownst to them were unarmed and had their weapons unloaded. Kane&#x27;s newly organized city police force generally succeeded in ensuring the Pennsylvania militia troops&#x27; safe passage marching south on Howard Street to Camden Street Station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Nevertheless, stones and bricks were hurled (along with many insults) and Nicholas Biddle, a black servant traveling with the regiment, was hit on the head. But that night the Pennsylvania troops, later known as the &quot;First Defenders&quot;, camped at the U.S. Capitol under the incomplete dome, which was then under construction.

==Incident==

On April 17, the 6th Massachusetts Militia departed from Boston, Mass., arriving in New York City the following morning and Philadelphia by nightfall. On April 19, the unit headed on to Baltimore, where they anticipated a slow transit through the city. Because of an ordinance preventing the construction of steam rail lines through the city, there was no direct rail connection between the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad&#x27;s President Street Station and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Camden Station (ten blocks to the west). Rail cars that transferred between the two stations had to be pulled by horses along Pratt Street.

Sometime after leaving Philadelphia, the unit&#x27;s colonel, Edward F. Jones, received information that passage through Baltimore &quot;would be resisted&quot;. According to his later report, Jones went through the railroad cars and gave this order:


Indeed, as the militia regiment transferred between stations, a mob of anti-war supporters and Southern sympathizers attacked the train cars and blocked the route. When it became apparent that they could not travel by horse-drawn railroad cars over the connecting track between the stations, the four companies, about 240 soldiers, got out of the cars and marched in formation through the city. However, the mob followed the soldiers, causing damage and placing obstructions until they finally blocked the soldiers. The mob attacked the rear companies of the regiment with &quot;bricks, paving stones, and pistols.&quot; In response, several soldiers fired into the mob, beginning a giant brawl between the soldiers, the mob, and the Baltimore police. In the end, the soldiers got to the Camden Station, and the police were able to block the crowd from them. The regiment had left behind much of their equipment, including their marching band&#x27;s instruments.

Five soldiers (Corporal Sumner Henry Needham of Company I and privates Luther C. Ladd, Charles Taylor, Addison Whitney and Sergeant John Ames of Company D) were killed or mortally wounded in the riot. About 36 men of the regiment were also wounded; many were left behind. At least 12 civilians were also killed. It is unknown how many more civilians were injured. Luther C. Ladd is often called the first Union soldier killed in action during the American Civil War.

The same day, after the attack on the soldiers, the office of the &quot;Baltimore Wecker&quot;, a German-language newspaper, was completely wrecked and the building seriously damaged by the same mob. The Wecker&#x27;s founder, Carl Heinrich Schnauffer, as well as its prominent employees had fled Germany after the failed revolution of 1848–49. The publisher, William Schnauffer, and the editor, Wilhelm Rapp, whose lives were threatened, were compelled to leave town. The publisher later returned and resumed publication of the &quot;Wecker&quot; which continued throughout the war to be a supporter of the Union cause. The editor moved to another paper in Illinois.

As a result of the riot in Baltimore and pro-Southern sympathies of some of the city&#x27;s populace, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company also declined the same day a Federal government request to transport Union forces to relieve the beleaguered Union naval yard facility at Portsmouth, Virginia.

==Aftermath==
In Brown&#x27;s later assessment, it was the Baltimore riot that pushed the two sides over the edge into full-scale war, &quot;because then was shed the first blood in a conflict between the North and the South; then a step was taken which made compromise or retreat almost impossible; then passions on both sides were aroused which could not be controlled&quot;.

On July 10, 1861, a grand jury of the United States District Court indicted Samuel Mactier, Lewis Bitter, James McCartney, Philip Casmire, Michael Hooper and Richard H. Mitchell for their part in the riot.

After the April 19 riot, some small skirmishes occurred throughout Baltimore between citizens and police for the next month, but a sense of normalcy returned as the city was cleaned up. Mayor Brown and Maryland Governor Hicks implored President Lincoln to send no further troops through Maryland to avoid further confrontations. However, as Lincoln remarked to a peace delegation from the YMCA, Union soldiers were &quot;neither birds to fly over Maryland, nor moles to burrow under it&quot;. On the evening of April 20 Hicks also authorized Brown to dispatch the Maryland state militia for the purpose of disabling the railroad bridges into the city—an act he would later deny. One of the militia leaders was John Merryman, who was arrested one month later, and held in defiance of a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, which led to the case of &quot;Ex parte Merryman&quot;. 

The city’s banks and wealthy individuals, such as Johns Hopkins, John Clark, and Colonel Columbus O&#x27;Donnell, convened quickly after recognizing the severity of the situation. In a meeting, the wealthy Union members who were supporters of the Union appropriated a sum of $500,000 to be expended under the mayor&#x27;s directions. Hopkins, born in 1795, was a Quaker, businessman, and staunch supporter of the Union. His belief in equality and social reform was deeply rooted in his Quaker upbringing and the experiences of the Civil War. During the Civil War, Hopkins was an ardent supporter of the Union by providing financial support to Union soldiers and their families. He tried to relieve suffering in Baltimore during this period. The committee raised funds-&quot;placing the whole sum at the disposal&quot;-to aid the efforts of the city in maintaining order and defence. This shows how civic leaders marshalled resources for the public good during the crisis. In his book &quot;History of Maryland&quot;, Thomas Scharf records this as a good example of leadership and collaboration. He says that actions of these figures were supported by several local newspapers, including American Exchange, German Correspondent, and the Clipper.

On April 19, Major General Robert Patterson, commander of the Department of Washington (Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia), ordered Brigadier General Benjamin Butler, with the 8th Massachusetts, to open and secure a route from Annapolis through Annapolis Junction to Washington. The 8th Massachusetts arrived by ship at Annapolis on April 20. Gov. Hicks and the Mayor of Annapolis protested, but Butler (a clever politician) bullied them into allowing troops to land at Annapolis, saying, &quot;&#x27;I &quot;must&quot; land, for my troops are hungry.&#x27;—&#x27;No one in Annapolis will sell them anything,&#x27; replied these authorities of the State and city.&quot; Butler intimated that armed men were not always limited to the necessity of &quot;purchasing&quot; food when famished.

The 8th Massachusetts, with the 7th New York Infantry Regiment, proceeded to Annapolis Junction (halfway between Baltimore and Washington), and the 7th New York went on to Washington, where, on the afternoon of April 25, they became the first troops to reach the capital by this route.

There were calls for Maryland to declare secession in the wake of the riot. Governor Hicks called a special session of the state legislature to consider the situation. Since Annapolis, the capital, was occupied by Federal troops, and Baltimore was harboring many pro-Confederate mobs, Hicks directed the legislature to meet in Frederick, in the predominantly Unionist western part of the state. The legislature met on April 26; on April 29, it voted 53–13 against secession, though it also voted not to reopen rail links with the North, and requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. At this time the legislature seems to have wanted to maintain Maryland&#x27;s neutrality in the conflict.

Many more Union troops arrived. On May 13, Butler sent Union troops into Baltimore and declared martial law. He was replaced as commander of the Department of Annapolis by George Cadwalader, another Brigadier General in the United States Volunteers. Lincoln subsequently had the mayor, police chief, entire Board of Police, and city council of Baltimore imprisoned without charges, as well as one sitting U.S. Congressman from Baltimore. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, also a native of Maryland, ruled on June 4, 1861, in ex parte Merryman that Lincoln&#x27;s suspension of habeas corpus was unconstitutional; but Lincoln ignored the ruling, and in September when Baltimore newspaper editor Frank Key Howard, Francis Scott Key&#x27;s grandson, criticized this in an editorial he too was imprisoned without trial. Federal troops imprisoned the young newspaper editor in Fort McHenry, which, as he noted, was the same fort where the Star Spangled Banner had been waving &quot;o&#x27;er the land of the free&quot; in his grandfather&#x27;s song. In 1863 Howard wrote about his experience as a political prisoner at Fort McHenry in the book &quot;Fourteen Months in the American Bastille&quot;; two of the publishers selling the book were then arrested.

A man supposed to be a Maryland State Militia soldier was detained in Fort McHenry, and Judge Giles, in Baltimore, issued a writ of habeas corpus, but Major W. W. Morris, commander of the fort, wrote back, &quot;At the date of issuing your writ, and for two weeks previous, the city which you live, and where your court has been held, was entirely under the control of revolutionary authorities. Within that period United States soldiers, while committing no offense, had been perfidiously attacked and inhumanly murdered in your streets; no punishment had been awarded, and, I believe, no arrests had been made for these crimes; supplies of provisions intended for this garrison has been stopped; the intention to capture this fort had been boldly proclaimed; your most public thoroughfares were daily patrolled by large numbers of troops, armed and clothed, at least in part, with articles stolen from the United States; and the Federal flag, while waving over the Federal offices, was cut down by some person wearing the uniform of a Maryland soldier. To add the foregoing, an assembly elected in defiance of law, but claiming to be the legislative body of your State, and so recognized by the Executive of Maryland, was debating the Federal compact. If all this be not rebellion, I know not what to call it. I certainly regard it as sufficient legal cause for suspending the privilege of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.&quot; Moreover, Morris wrote, &quot;If, in an experience of thirty-three years, you have never before known the writ to be disobeyed, it is only because such a contingency in political affairs as the present has never before arisen.&quot;

Just before daybreak on June 27, soldiers marched from Fort McHenry on orders from Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, who had succeeded Cadwalader as commander of the Department of Annapolis, and arrested Marshal George P. Kane. Banks appointed Col. John Reese Kenly of the 1st Regiment Maryland Volunteer Infantry as provost marshal to superintend the Baltimore police; Kenly enrolled, organized, and armed 250 Unionists for a new police. When the old Board of Police would not recognize the new police, and tried to continue the old police, they were arrested and sent to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. On July 10, George R. Dodge, a civilian, was appointed as marshal of police.

Major General John Adams Dix succeeded Banks in command of the Department of Annapolis, and Colonel Abram Duryée&#x27;s 5th New York Volunteer Infantry, &quot;Duryée&#x27;s Zouaves,&quot; constructed Fort Federal Hill, Baltimore. To better secure the city, a ring of additional fortifications were built in and around the city, most notably Fort Worthington to the northeast (around present-day Berea), and Fort Marshall (in present-day Highlandtown/Canton).

Some Southerners reacted with passion to the incident. James Ryder Randall, a teacher in Louisiana but a native Marylander who had lost a friend in the riots, wrote &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; for the Southern cause in response to the riots. The poem was later set to &quot;Lauriger Horatius&quot; (the tune of &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot;), a melody popular in the South, and referred to the riots with lines such as &quot;Avenge the patriotic gore / That flecked the streets of Baltimore&quot;. It did not become Maryland&#x27;s state song until 78 years later (1939). After many efforts to revoke this status, it was removed from being the state song in 2021.

On September 17, 1861, the day the legislature reconvened to discuss these later events and Lincoln&#x27;s possibly unconstitutional actions, twenty-seven state legislators (one-third of the Maryland General Assembly) were arrested and jailed by federal troops, using Lincoln&#x27;s suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, and in further defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice&#x27;s &quot;ex parte Merryman&quot; ruling. As a result, the legislative session was canceled. A new legislature was elected in November 1861.

<text>Silver on the Tree is a contemporary fantasy novel by Susan Cooper, published by Chatto &amp; Windus in 1977. It is the final entry in the five book &quot;Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot;.

== Plot ==
Will Stanton and his mentor Merriman, two of the last Old Ones, gather allies and magical objects to help defeat the rising Dark. They ally with Bran, a Welsh descendant of King Arthur, and the three Drew children, to form the Six who are prophesied to triumph over the powers of the Dark. Significant mythical elements in the book include the bard Taliesin (under his alternate name Gwion), King Gwyddno Garanhir and the Drowned Hundred, the Welsh tradition of the Mari Llwyd, Arthur&#x27;s ship Prydwen, and the Ritual of oak and mistletoe.

== Critical reception ==
The book was compared less favourably to earlier instalments in the series, with particular criticism towards its final battle. However, it still received generally positive reviews. Mari Ness of Tor.com praised it for being &quot;beautifully and lyrically written&quot;, but was critical of its ending and its use of the damsel in distress trope. Nevertheless, she called it a &quot;solid ending&quot; for the series. &quot;The Children&#x27;s Literature Review&quot; criticized elements of the book&#x27;s plot, such as the use of time travel, but praised its setting and descriptive writing.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; was critical of the book&#x27;s climax, saying &quot;to the end the discrepancy between her grand scheme and the particulars of the story is unbridged, giving a morally and intellectually hollow ring to the whole.&quot; Rebecca Fisher of fantasyliterature.com praised Cooper&#x27;s subtle writing, but criticized the book&#x27;s pacing choices and lack of suspense.

&quot;Silver on the Tree&quot; received a Tir na n-Og Award in 1978. It was nominated for a Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel and a Ditmar Award, but did not win.

<text>StyleWriter is a line of inkjet serial printers by Apple, targeted mainly towards consumers. They produced print quality that was better than the dot matrix ImageWriters, and were cheaper than the LaserWriters. All but a few models contained Canon print engines, while the last few were re-badged HP Deskjet printers. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he discontinued most of the company&#x27;s accessory product lines, including the StyleWriter and LaserWriter.

== Models ==
=== StyleWriter models ===
==== StyleWriter ====

The StyleWriter was the first of Apple&#x27;s line of inkjet serial printers, targeted mainly towards consumers. The feed mechanism was removable, and paper could be fed through manually in a virtually straight line.

==== StyleWriter II ====

The StyleWriter II replaced the original. This model, based on a Canon engine that printed at 360 DPI, had twice the memory of its predecessor and double the printing speed. The enclosure was restyled in Apple&#x27;s &quot;neoclassical&quot; design language of the time.

==== StyleWriter 1200 ====

The StyleWriter 1200 was the third of Apple&#x27;s line of inkjet serial printers, released after the StyleWriter II. Based on the same Canon engine, this model had faster printing speed than its predecessor, but used the same ink cartridge.

==== Portable StyleWriter ====

The Portable StyleWriter was a portable inkjet printer manufactured in 1993 and was designed to match the PowerBook 100 Series portable computer. It was powered by a Nickel–cadmium battery or an external AC adapter. It sacrificed ergonomics, printing speed and grayscale for portability. An optional automatic sheet feeder was also available. Unlike most Apple printers, the Portable StyleWriter came only with a Parallel port, but was sold with a cable adapter allowing connection to a Macintosh serial port.

=== Color StyleWriter models ===

==== Color StyleWriter Pro ====
The Color StyleWriter Pro was a color inkjet printer manufactured and sold by Apple in 1994. It was based on the Canon BJC-600 series of Bubble Jet printers, with which it shares ink cartridge compatibility. Its distinguishing feature among Color StyleWriter printers is its use of separate ink cartridges for each of three colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) plus black. In contrast, other Color StyleWriters used a combined color cartridge plus a black cartridge.

==== Color StyleWriter 2400 ====
The Color StyleWriter 2400 is a color inkjet printer manufactured and sold by Apple. It was introduced in late 1994 to supplement the Color StyleWriter Pro as a more affordable product. It uses the same Canon engine as the BJC-4000 and features a 360-dpi resolution, a dual ink cartridge system (1 Black and 1 Cyan-Magenta-Yellow colors) that can be replaced by an alternative high capacity black ink that allows printing twice as fast when only black &amp; white is needed. Its initial Manufacturer&#x27;s Suggested Retail Price was US$525.

In mid-1995, it saw a software update to bringing new features, as well as a significant price drop.

The Color StyleWriter 2400 is notable for its compatibility with the Apple Pippin console gaming system.

==== Color StyleWriter 2200 ====

The Color StyleWriter 2200 was a color inkjet printer manufactured and sold by Apple in 1995.

The 2200, the color successor of the Portable StyleWriter was aimed at mobile professionals, as it could be powered by a battery and only weighed 3.1 lbs.
Its dark grey case design matched the PowerBook series at the time of the release. This was the second and last printer Apple made in this color range. The 2200 was smaller and more rounded, matching the PowerBook 1400 and 5300 series.

==== Color StyleWriter 1500 ====
The Color StyleWriter 1500 was an entry-level Canon-engine color inkjet printer manufactured and sold by Apple in 1996.

==== Color StyleWriter 2500 ====
The Color StyleWriter 2500 was a performance color inkjet printer manufactured and sold by Apple in 1996. It was based on a Canon-developed Bubble Jet printer, but was repackaged with a new housing, firmware, and Apple&#x27;s proprietary 8-pin mini-DIN serial port. The printer is similar in appearance and functionality to the StyleWriter 2400, but featured faster printing speeds: 5 PPM black, 0.66 color, vs the 2400&#x27;s 3 PPM black, 0.3 color. As with the 2400, the 2500 was compatible with the Apple Pippin console gaming system. Apple offered LocalTalk and EtherTalk networking upgrades in the form of external print server devices. Also offered was a &quot;PhotoGrade&quot; kit, which included a special monobloc (heads and ink in one unit) cartridge with lighter photo-oriented inks and coated paper.

==== Color StyleWriter 4100, 4500, and 6500 ====
The Color StyleWriter 4100, 4500, and 6500 were color inkjet printers manufactured and sold by Apple in 1997. These models were all rebadged Deskjet.

<text>Ameghino is a lunar impact crater located to the north of the Sinus Successus, a bay in the northeast part of Mare Fecunditatis. Less than 15 kilometers to the northwest of Ameghino were the landing sites of the Soviet Luna 18 and Luna 20 probes.

This formation was designated Apollonius C before being given a name by the IAU, in honour of the Argentine scientific and paleontologist Florentino Ameghino. Apollonius itself is located to the east-northeast.

<doc id="951978" wikidata="Q3589757" url="?curid=951978" title="Australia national rugby league team">
<text>The Australian national rugby league team, the Kangaroos, have represented Australia in senior men&#x27;s rugby league football competitions since the establishment of the game in Australia in 1908. Administered by the Australian Rugby League Commission, the Kangaroos are ranked first in the IRL Men&#x27;s World Rankings. The team is the most successful in Rugby League World Cup history, having won the competition 12 times, and contested 15 of the 16 finals, only failing to reach the final in the 1954 inaugural tournament. Only five nations (along with NZ Maori) have beaten Australia in test matches, and Australia has an overall win percentage of 69%.

Dating back to 1908, Australia is the fourth oldest national side after England, New Zealand and Wales. The team was first assembled in 1908 for a tour of Great Britain. The majority of the Kangaroos&#x27; games since then have been played against Great Britain and New Zealand. In the first half of the 20th century, Australia&#x27;s international competition came from alternating tours to Great Britain and New Zealand. Australia played host to these teams in non-tour years. Great Britain dominated in the early years, and Australia did not win a Test against the Lions until 11 November 1911 under captain Chris McKivat. Australia did not win a series at home against Great Britain until 1920 or abroad until 1958.

Since 1908, the team has been nicknamed the Kangaroos. Initially only used when touring Great Britain and later France, this has been the official nickname of the team since 7 July 1994. In 1997 Australia was also represented by a &quot;Super League Australia&quot; team, drawing on players from that year&#x27;s Super League competition.

==History==
Rugby football has been played in Australia since the 1860s. In 1863, Sydney University became the first rugby club to be formed in Sydney, and played games amongst themselves or against the crews of visiting British ships. The Sydney Football Club (1865) and the Wallaroos (1870) followed, and inter-club competition commenced. By 1880, there were 100 clubs across the country, and rugby quickly became the dominant winter sport for Sydney.

In 1888, an English team visited Australasia, playing rugby rules in Queensland, New South Wales and New Zealand, and Australian rules football in Victoria and South Australia. In 1899, an Australian team was formed using players from Queensland and New South Wales for the first time. They played a series of Tests against a British team.

===1900s===
By 1907, Sydney club rugby games were attracting up to 20,000 people, with all profits going to the Southern Rugby Football Union, as the sport was officially an amateur one. This caused discontent among players, and in 1908 the New South Wales Rugby Football League and Queensland Rugby League were formed.

An Australian national rugby league team was first formed during the first season of rugby league in Australia, the 1908 NSWRFL Premiership season. The team, which was made of players from the NSWRFL with a few Queensland rugby rebels added, first played against the &quot;professional All Blacks&quot; on the return leg of their tour of Australia and Great Britain.

Later that year, the Australian team arranged to go on a tour of its own. The first Kangaroos arrived in England on 27 September 1908, and played their first-ever test against the Northern Union in December in London. It finished at 22 in front of a crowd of 2,000. The second test in Newcastle in January 1909 attracted a crowd of 22,000, and the Northern Union won 15–5. The third test was played at Villa Park, Birmingham, the Northern Union winning again 6–5 before a crowd of 9,000. The Australians suggested that the series be named &#x27;The Ashes&#x27; after the cricket series of the same name.

In 1909, when the new &quot;Northern Union&quot; code was still in its infancy in Australia, a match between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the Rugby League side winning 29–26.

===1910s===
The first British tour of the Southern Hemisphere began on 4 June 1910, when the Northern Union played New South Wales in front of 33,000 spectators in Sydney, losing 28–14. But they won the first test in Sydney against Australia 27–20 in front of 42,000. They then won the second test in Brisbane 22–17. In Auckland, on 30 July, they defeated New Zealand 52–20. The 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand was the first-ever, and Australia were beaten by the Ashes in two tests, faring slightly better than &quot;Australasia&quot; with two Kiwis added to their squad. The 1911–12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain was undertaken by an &#x27;Australasian&#x27; squad that included four New Zealanders. They won the Ashes for the first time, and for the next half century, no other touring team did do so on British soil.

The 1914 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand was the second time the British toured down under. The Australians, captained by Sid Deane for all three tests, got one victory but lost the series in the famous decider, the &quot;Rorke&#x27;s Drift Test&quot;. Australia also went on a tour of New Zealand in 1919.

===1920s===
The 1920 Great Britain Lions tour saw Australia win the Ashes for the first time on home soil. Crowds were massive, including nearly 70,000 at the first Tour match versus Sydney. The 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain also included a New Zealander and was ostensibly an Australasian side. In January 1922, an &quot;England&quot; side defeated Australia 6–0 at The Willows, Salford, to win back the Ashes that had been lost in 1920. They did not lose again until 1950.

The Australian national team first wore green and gold in a hooped design on Saturday, 23 June 1928, when they met Great Britain in the first Test at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. Britain led 10-2 after 25 minutes, 13-7 at half time, and, after a nervous second half, eventually claimed the Test 15–12. The England team won both the 1928 series in Australia and New Zealand by two tests to one. They were presented with the Ashes Trophy by the Australians, which the two countries have competed for ever since.

The 1929–30 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain was the fourth Kangaroo tour, and took the Australian team all around England and also into Wales. The tour also featured the ninth Ashes series which comprised four Test matches and was won by Great Britain.

===1930s===
The first test of the 1932 Ashes series between Australia and Great Britain drew a world record international rugby league attendance of 70,204 to the Sydney Cricket Ground. This attendance stood as the world record until the 1992 World Cup final played at Wembley Stadium, and as of 2013 remains the record attendance for a rugby league test played in Australia. The Jim Sullivan led Lions triumphed over the Herb Steinohrt led Australians 8–6.

On the 1933–34 tour New South Wales winger Dave Brown played in 32 matches, including all 3 Tests, scoring 285 points, at the time the greatest number ever attained by an Australian player on tour.

An exhibition match between Australia and Great Britain at Paris&#x27; Stade Pershing in December 1933 inspired the beginnings of rugby league in France.

===1940s===
Albert Johnston was a national selector in 1946 and coach of the national side for the 1946 first post-WWII Anglo-Australian series.
Australia&#x27;s 1948-49 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France was their seventh tour to the UK. They played the Ashes series against a side officially called Great Britain.

===1950s===

During the 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand, Australia lost the three-Test series to the powerful French team inspired by their freakish goal kicking fullback Puig Aubert.

The 1954 Rugby League World Cup was the first tournament held in either rugby code. Australia failed to reach the final.

For the 1956–57 Kangaroo tour a record eleven Queenslanders were selected in the touring squad. Great Britain defeated Australia 19–0 at Station Road, Swinton, to take the Ashes series 2–1.

Australia hosted and won the 1957 World Cup.

For the 1959–60 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, the home nation retained the Ashes by winning the Test series 2–1 by the following results.

* First Test – Great Britain 14–22 Australia at Station Road, Swinton.
* Second Test – Great Britain 11–10 Australia at Headingley, Leeds.
* Third Test – Great Britain 18–12 Australia at Central Park, Wigan.

This was the last British Ashes win on home soil.

===1960s===
For the 1960 World Cup no final was held. Still, the last game, which was between the previously undefeated Great Britain and Australia sides, made it the tournament decider. Great Britain won 10–3.

Harry Bath was selected manager, coach and as the sole selector for the Australian national team&#x27;s 1962 Ashes series.

After ten previous tours of Britain, the 1963–64 Kangaroo tour saw Australia&#x27;s first ever Ashes victory on British soil. The Arthur Summons coached Kangaroos won the first test at Wembley Stadium before rampaging to a famous 50–12 win in the second test at Station Road in Swinton. Although they lost the third test at Headingley, legendary winger Ken Irvine became the first Australian player to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. The Kangaroos have not lost a series in Britain since.

Harry Bath coached the national side to World Cup glory in the 1968 World Cup. He also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1969.

===1970s===
The last time that Great Britain won the Ashes was in 1970. They won the series 2–1 in Australia. Out of 24 games played Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one – making them the most successful British tourists so far. The 1970 Lions contained a galaxy of stars including captain Frank Myler, Roger Millward, Cliff Watson and Mal Reilly. Future Kangaroo Tour captain and later coach Bob Fulton made his test debut in the 1970 Ashes series (Fulton had actually played 3 games for Australia in the 1968 World Cup but at the time tests and World Cup games were classed differently). Harry Bath again coached Australia to victory in the 1970 World Cup final in a brutal game that became known as the &quot;Battle of Headingley&quot;. Bath also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1971. On that tour Geoff Starling became the youngest player to ever represent Australia. He was 18 years and 181 days old when playing a tour match against a New Zealand XIII at Huntly.

Australia lost the 1972 World Cup Final to Great Britain in controversial circumstances. Australian captain Graeme Langlands was denied what seemed a fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback Dennis Ward. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau&#x27;s alleged reason for not awarding the try was that he did not believe anyone could have scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger Clive Sullivan.

On the 1978 Kangaroo tour, Great Britain defeated Australia in the second test at Bradford, 18–14, before a crowd of 26,447. It took ten years, and fifteen consecutive test defeats before Britain could defeat the Kangaroos again, starting with Australia&#x27;s 3–0 whitewash of the Lions during their 1979 Australasian tour. The Kangaroos had already won the first test 15–9 at Wigan and wrapped up the series with a 23–6 win in the third test at Headingley. However, the Australians were defeated by the French team in both tests played at the end of the 1978 tour. This was the last defeat of the Kangaroos in a series until 2005.

===1980s===
The 1980s was the decade in which Australia began to truly dominate world rugby league. Along with the emergence of State of Origin football came a new crop of superstar players who led Australia throughout the 1980s. Players such as Peter Sterling, Mal Meninga, Wayne Pearce, Brett Kenny, Eric Grothe and Wally Lewis came to prominence on the 1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. Australia&#x27;s performance was taken into a new dimension by the tourists, also known as &#x27;the Invincibles&#x27;, when they became the first team to win every game of the tour (fifteen games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators. After the extremely poor showing during their 1979 Australasian tour, the Kangaroos rammed home just how far behind British football had fallen at Boothferry Park. The score was only 10–4 at half time, but after the break Australia&#x27;s superior fitness showed and ran in six unanswered tries to leave the crowd and British football stunned.

In 1983, Arthur Beetson became the first Aboriginal to coach the Australian team after Frank Stanton had stood down following the Kangaroo Tour. Although Australia won the first test against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland, the Kiwis shocked by winning the return match 19–12 at Lang Park in Brisbane.

When the Lions toured in 1984, The Kangaroos again swept The Ashes series 3–0 under new team captain Wally Lewis, the first Queenslander to captain Australia since Arthur Beetson in 1974. Beetson was replaced as coach in 1984 by a returning Frank Stanton.

In 1985, Australia made a six-match tour of New Zealand under the coaching of Terry Fearnley who before the tour had coached NSW to its first ever Origin series win over Qld (the tour actually took place between games 2 and 3 of the Origin series). The Kangaroos won five of those matches, and the Test series 2–1. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane 26–20. On Sunday 30 June 1985, Australia met New Zealand in the second Test at Carlaw Park, Auckland. The Test was a 20,000 sell-out, with all tickets accounted for weeks before the match. The Kiwis dominated long periods of the game but ninety seconds from time the Kiwis lost possession close to half way. John Ribot scored a try and Australia won 10–6. The tour ended in acrimony as tensions between coach Fearley and the Qld players, led by team captain Wally Lewis, reached boiling point with Lewis publicly stating that he had caught Fearnley and team vice-captain Wayne Pearce going over team selections in Fearnley&#x27;s hotel room. However, both Fearnley and Pearce denied the allegations. After the second test win Fearnley made 4 changes to the test team for the third and final test at Carlaw Park with all four players were omitted being Queenslanders. The changes proved disastrous and NZ ran out easy 18–0 winners.

Following the tour, the Australian Rugby League decided that from then on the Kangaroos coach could not also double as the incumbent coach of either NSW or Qld.

Former Kangaroo Don Furner became Australian coach in 1986 and immediately formed a good working relationship with Wally Lewis and the players. The now harmonious Australians swept New Zealand 3–0 in a mid-season test series played in Australia.

During the 1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France a then record northern hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attended the first test of the Ashes series at Old Trafford with the Walle Lewis led Australians winning 38–16. On 16 December 1986 the Kangaroos set a new record for largest-ever winning margin in a Test match at 52–0 against France. In their two Tests against France, the Australians ran in 96 points and conceded just a single penalty goal. After suffering such heavy losses, France decided to call off their proposed 1987 tour of Australia. This became the second consecutive tour of Europe in which Australia had won all their games. By the end of the tour, Terry Lamb had become the first player to appear in every match on a Kangaroo Tour. For this tour Wally Lewis, Greg Dowling, Bob Lindner, Gene Miles (Wynnum Manly) and Bryan Neibling (Redcliffe) became the last players selected to tour from the Brisbane Rugby League competition. By being named as tour captain, Wally Lewis became the first Queenslander to captain a Kangaroo Tour since Tom Gorman in 1929/30.

Australia crashed to a defeat on Tuesday 21 July 1987, when the Kangaroo dominance of the international game suffered a setback. New Zealand were their opponents in a match at Lang Park in Brisbane, which had been arranged to fill the gap created by the non-appearance of France. New Zealand won the game 13–6. The next four internationals between Australia and New Zealand were all staged in New Zealand, and all were won by the Kangaroos.

During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour the Ashes were successfully retained by Australia by winning the first two Tests, however Great Britain won the third test 26–12 at the Sydney Football Stadium, ending a 15-game winning streak between the two teams that stretched back to the third Ashes test of 1978. Later that month, Australia&#x27;s 62-point win over Papua New Guinea in the NSW country town of Wagga Wagga set a new record for largest winning margin in international rugby league. Australian dual international winger Michael O&#x27;Connor also set a new record for most points scored by an individual in international rugby league (30 points – 4 tries, 7 goals). Also in 1988, as part of the bicentenary celebrations, Australia played a one-off test match against Rest Of The World at the Sydney Football Stadium, winning the one-off test 22–10. The 1985–1988 Rugby League World Cup culminated in the World Cup final against New Zealand at Auckland&#x27;s Eden Park ground (the home of NZ rugby union). Australia won a brutal World Cup final 25–12 in front of 47,363. Captain Wally Lewis broke his arm during the game.

In 1989 the Kangaroos toured New Zealand, taking a record-breaking twelve Queenslanders in the 20 man squad after Queensland&#x27;s second straight 3-0 State of Origin series win over New South Wales. Don Furner had retired from coaching after the 1988 World Cup final with Manly-Warringah 1987 Sydney Rugby League premiership winning coach and 1978 Kangaroo tour captain Bob Fulton taking over from 1989. Fulton&#x27;s first series in charge of the Australian team saw them sweep New Zealand 3–0 during their 1989 tour.

===1990s===
The Bob Fulton coached Kangaroos played two mid-season tests in 1990. They defeated France 34–2 on a cold night in Parkes with Mal Meninga taking over the captaincy from Wally Lewis who was unavailable with a broken arm. They then played a single test against New Zealand in Wellington, winning 24–6.

With Wally Lewis controversially ruled unfit for the 1990 Kangaroo tour, his Queensland teammate Mal Meninga, making his 3rd Kangaroo Tour, retained the Australian captaincy. The Ashes got off to a bad start for the Kangaroos when Great Britain shocked Australia to win the first test 19–12 at Wembley Stadium in front of a new record home crowd of 54,567. The second test at Old Trafford in Manchester was a tight, thrilling affair that saw two of the most famous tries scored in test match football. Debutante 5/8 Cliff Lyons second half try came after the Kangaroos kept the ball alive through 13 sets of hands before winger Andrew Ettingshausen raced down the wing and centre kicked for Lyons to score. With the scores tied at 10-all going into injury time and the Kangaroos pinned just 15 metres from their line, Ricky Stuart set off on a 75-metre run before passing to Meninga winning try only seconds from full-time to give Australia a 14–10 win. The Kangaroos then wrapped up The Ashes with a comprehensive 14–0 win in the third test at Elland Road in Leeds. Meninga as captain became just the third Australian (after Ken Irvine in 1962 and 1963–64, and Sam Backo in 1988) to score a try in each test of an Ashes series.

Australia faced New Zealand in a three-game mid-season Test series in 1991. The first test, played at the Olympic Park Stadium in Melbourne (the first rugby league test played in Australia outside of NSW or Qld) saw the Kiwis again defeat Australia after a successful Kangaroo tour. NZ won the first test 24–8 in Melbourne in front of 26,900 fans, however a new look Australian side came back to win the second test 44–0 in Sydney and the third test 40–12 in Brisbane. At the end of the 1991 NSWRL season, the Kangaroos embarked on their first (and as of 2017 only) tour of Papua New Guinea, winning all five games on tour including easily both tests against the Papua New Guinea Kumuls.

During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia, the British lost the first test 22–6 in Sydney before stunning the Australians when they easily won the 2nd Ashes test 33–10 at Princes Park in Melbourne, but lost the 3rd test 16–10 in Brisbane. The 1992 Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley Stadium set a then international attendance record for a rugby league international of 73,631. The Bob Fulton coached, Mal Meninga captained Australians defeat Great Britain 10–6 to win their 7th Rugby League World Cup title. The WCF was a tight game with the Lions leading 6–4 with less than 20 minutes remaining before an on debut Steve Renouf crossed for the only try of the game and along with Meninga&#x27;s sideline conversion gave the Kangaroos a famous victory.

Australia again played a mid-season test series against New Zealand in 1993. The first test at the Mt Smart Stadium in Auckland ended in a 14-all draw thanks to a late Laurie Daley field goal. Daley had captained Australia for the first time in the match following a two-game suspension to Mal Meninga. The Kangaroos then won the second test 16–8 at the very wet Palmerston North Showgrounds before wrapping up the series with a 16–4 win at Lang Park in Brisbane.

On 4 July 1994, Australia defeated France 58–0 at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney, their only test on home soil for the year. The 1994 Kangaroo Tour was the last time the Australian national team played matches against British provincial teams, in addition to the Tests. Australia continued its dominance, winning both Test series against Great Britain and France, suffering only one loss (again, against Great Britain in the First Test at Wembley), and remained undefeated against British club outfits in a streak stretching back to 1978. Australia adopted the name &#x27;Kangaroos&#x27; for the July test against France, since then the team has been officially known by this name. The 1994 Kangaroo tour was also the first (and only) time that the traditional Australian test kit was only worn during test matches. For the tour games, including the friendly against Wales in Cardiff (the first time Australia had played Wales in 12 years), the Kangaroos wore jumpers that had increasing thickness gold hoops underneath the twin gold chevrons.

The Australian team that contested and won the 1995 Rugby League World Cup consisted only of players from clubs that remained loyal to the Australian Rugby League during the Super League war. This meant several Super League-aligned clubs that were already well-established internationals were not selected for the World Cup squad. During 1995, the Kangaroos defeated New Zealand 3–0 in the Trans-Tasman Test series played in Australia. As they were for the World Cup, only ARL loyal players were selected for Australia which saw several players, including Steve Menzies, Mark Coyne, Terry Hill, Gary Larson, Trevor Gillmeister and Jason Smith make their test debuts during the New Zealand series. Despite having what many described as a second string side without players such as Laurie Daley, Allan Langer, Andrew Ettingshausen, Brett Mullins, Glenn Lazarus, Bradley Clyde, Ian Roberts, Ricky Stuart and Steve Walters, Bob Fulton&#x27;s Kangaroos won their 8th World Cup (and 5th in a row) when they defeated England 16–8 in the World Cup final in front of 66,540 fans at Wembley. The star of the day for Australia was halfback/hooker Andrew Johns.

In 1997 also, due to the Super League war, Australian rugby league was split down the middle by two competitions: the ARL&#x27;s Optus Cup and Super League&#x27;s Telstra Cup. As a result, that season there were also two Australian sides:
Australian Rugby League

 Australia v Rest Of The World(Only Establishment League Test)
11 July 1997
Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane

Super League

 Australia v Great Britain(1st Super League Test)
1 November 1997
Wembley Stadium, London


Great Britain played a home three-Test series against the Australian Super League Test team in 1997 and lost 2–1. The three matches played have been given test status by the UK&#x27;s Rugby Football League. The Australian Rugby League has decided not to recognise the matches of its rival as tests since the Super League war ended and does not consider the series to be a genuine Ashes contest. Super League&#x27;s Anzac Test concept, which is an early season one-off test match against New Zealand was retained and has been played annual ever since.

The 1998 Kangaroo Tour was cancelled because of the Super League war. With the Super League war finally over in 1998, Great Britain travelled to the Southern Hemisphere for the first Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament with Australia and New Zealand in 1999.

Chris Anderson took over from Wayne Bennett as coach of the team in March 1999.

===2000s===
The new millennium started with the 2000 World Cup which Australia won.

In 2001 the Australians arrived in Britain for the first Ashes series since 1994. Great Britain surprised everyone by winning the first test, but lost the next two.

In July 2002, Australia handed Great Britain their worst ever test defeat by defeating them 64–10 in a Sydney test match.

In 2003 the New Zealand Rugby League counted its 100th international match against Australia, because they take World Cup matches and Super League tests into account.

In November 2003, Great Britain lost an Ashes series 0–3 on home soil. The margin was extremely small in each game, 22–18 in game 1, 23–20 in game 2 and 18–12 in game 3 and it was known as Brett Kimmorley&#x27;s greatest series as he orchestrated Australia&#x27;s last minute victories. However, the dominance of the Australian team over the last generation has begun to slip since 2003.

In 2003 and 2005 New Zealand won the Bill Kelly Memorial Trophy from Australia. Australia won the first two Rugby League Tri-Nations competitions in 1999 and 2004, before being defeated by New Zealand in the final of the 2005 competition on 26 November 2005. Before that defeat Australia had not lost a Test series since December 1978, when they were defeated by France in both Test matches. On 4 November 2006, Australia lost to Great Britain 23–12 . It was a huge upset, and the first time since 1988 that the Kangaroos had been beaten by Great Britain in Sydney. The match was Australia&#x27;s 3rd match of the 2006 Tri-Nations series, having already secured a place in the final with two wins against New Zealand earlier in the tournament 30–18 and 20–15. The Australian side reclaimed the title of Tri-Nations champions on 25 November with a victory over the New Zealand side in the final by 16–12 with a try in the second period of extra time by captain Darren Lockyer.

In 2007 Australia played two test matches, both against New Zealand and both emphatic victories. The first 30–6 and the second 58–0.

Australia hosted the 2008 World Cup and did not have to qualify. They did not lose a match until the final, which they lost to New Zealand 34–20, who became world champions for the first time. Following this loss, Ricky Stuart was replaced as coach by Tim Sheens, then the most experienced NRL coach.

Tim Sheens&#x27; first match as Australian coach was against New Zealand 2009 Anzac Test. In this match Sheen&#x27;s side included a record-equalling ten Queensland representatives, including an all maroon backline and front row, reflecting the state&#x27;s dominance in the annual State of Origin series. All of the points were also scored by Queenslanders in the 38–10 victory. Later that year Australia traveled up to play in the inaugural Four Nations tournament. The Kangaroos advanced to the final after a draw against New Zealand, and wins over co-hosts England and France. Australia took on the English in the final and despite at one point trailing 14–16, a dominant last quarter of the game saw Australia win the inaugural Four Nations tournament. Captain Darren Lockyer also reached a milestone in this match after becoming the first Australian to make 50 appearances for his country.

===2010s===
Australia began 2010 with a 4-point win in the Anzac Test that symbolised the opening of the new stadium in Melbourne: AAMI Park. After the 2010 domestic season the major international tournament was the 2010 Four Nations held in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia&#x27;s opening match against Papua New Guinea, captain Darren Lockyer surpassed Ken Irvine&#x27;s record for most test tries for Australia, scoring his 34th. Australia won all of their matches comfortably to advance to the final to have a 2008 World Cup final re-match against New Zealand at Suncorp Stadium. The Kiwis won the game 16–12, and 2010 Four Nations title, after a try in the final seconds of the match.

Australia gained revenge over the Kiwis after another Anzac Test win, retaining the Bill Kelly Memorial Trophy in the process with a 10-point win on the Gold Coast. Later in that year Australia played a test-match against New Zealand, 12 days before the 2011 Four Nations kicked off, at the newly reconstructed Ausgrid Stadium in Newcastle. Australia thrashed the Kiwis by 36 points in front of a record crowd. Darren Lockyer became the most capped International player of all-time after surpassing New Zealand international Ruben Wiki&#x27;s record of 55 appearances for his country. Australia took on New Zealand again in the opening game of the Four Nations, held in England and Wales. The Australians yet again beat their trans-tasman rivals. They then went on to beat England at Wembley and were surprised in their final round-robin fixture after Wales were leading 8–0 after 13 minutes and were behind Australia by only 10 points at the break. But Sheens&#x27; men thrashed the Welsh to easily advance to another final meeting with England. After being tied with the English at one point in the second half, Australia went on to win the game by 22 points.

In 2012, the Anzac Test was held in New Zealand for the first time since 1998, which was the Kiwis last win in the fixture. Home advantage made no difference for the Kiwis as Sheens&#x27; Kangaroos won the match by eight points. The Kangaroos took on the Kiwis one more time later in the year, this time in Townsville. In front of a sold-out crowd, the Kangaroos won the test-match with another eight point victory. There was no tournament this year because there was a World Cup next year for the teams to prepare for.

Australia began the 2013 International season by retaining the Bill Kelly Memorial Trophy after another Anzac Test win. At the end of the year, Australia traveled up to play in the 2013 World Cup co-hosted by England and Wales. In their opening game against England, the Kangaroos faced a 0–10 scoreline after twenty minutes. But Australia went on to regain the control and go on to win the match by eight points. The England match was Australia&#x27;s only &#x27;scare&#x27; in the tournament as the Kangaroos went on to win and dominate all of their remaining matches, recording a 244–4 total aggregate score. They went on to earn revenge for their defeat to New Zealand five years ago in the World Cup final to beat them this time around at the same stage. The final was watched in front of a record International rugby league attendance of 74,468. In the match, five-eighth, Johnathan Thurston broke Mick Cronin&#x27;s 31-year record of top point scorer after a conversion took him past the previous record of 309 points. This was the Kangaroos&#x27; tenth World Cup title. After the England game, Australia recorded five successive games without conceding a try in the tournament. This feat was one game off equaling the 1981–82 Australian team&#x27;s record.

Australia could not equal that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They took on the Kiwis in the second of the double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia&#x27;s record against the Kiwis at the venue continued to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the &#x27;Cauldron&#x27;. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who&#x27;d become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata&#x27;utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the &#x27;Poms&#x27;. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see whether or not it was Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall&#x27;s right hand&#x27;s little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed &#x27;inconclusive&#x27; by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia&#x27;s first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they could not get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18–22.

The 2015 Anzac Test was held in Suncorp Stadium. The Australian team&#x27;s horrible record in Brisbane against the Kiwis continued as they suffered another defeat and records continued to be made for the New Zealand team. This was the first time they beat Australia for three consecutive test-matches since 1953 and the first time they won the Anzac Test since 1998. Australia did not play another test-match that year.
After the match Sheens was facing scrutiny from the media after many believed it was time for the old players he fielded to move on since the much younger Kiwis side had beaten them on the past three occasions. Australia also dropped down to number 2 on the RLIF World Rankings, which added further scrutiny. At the end of the year, Sheens was unable to cope with the pressure of the media, despite wanting to coach the team at the 2017 World Cup. He took up an advisory role with English domestic club Salford Red Devils and therefore resigned as coach of the Australian national team.

In December 2015, successful Queensland Maroons coach Mal Meninga announced he&#x27;d leave his role as the coach of the Queensland representative side to coach the Australian national team. Before his appointment Mal announced his ambitions that he wanted the International game to become the pinnacle of rugby league like it was in his playing days.

Mal Meninga&#x27;s first game in charge as Australian coach was the 2016 Anzac Test. Before the test, Meninga stirred controversy around the rugby league world after selecting Fijian born player Semi Radradra, who is eligible due to living in Australia for three years, in his team over other &#x27;homegrown&#x27; Australian players. Radradra, who represented Fiji at the 2013 World Cup, still had a Fijian passport at that time and this brought up the question of changing eligibility rules in International rugby league. Meninga&#x27;s selection questioned the ambition he raised of wanting to make the International game the pinnacle of the sport. Australia won the test-match 16–0 and in the process ended their losing-run against the Kiwis. They also held New Zealand scoreless in a test-match for the first time since 2007. But despite the result Australia suffered criticism with commentator Phil Gould saying the Australian team is &#x27;too old&#x27; and are &#x27;kidding themselves if they think they&#x27;ll win the World Cup next year&#x27;. He believes Australia should&#x27;ve put much more points on a &#x27;weakened&#x27; New Zealand team missing many regular players through various reasons. Meninga hit back saying &#x27;That was a real test-match. That&#x27;s what test footy is. People who have never played it don&#x27;t know what it is.&#x27; 
At the conclusion of the 2016 domestic season, Australia took on New Zealand in Perth in what was the first ever test-match in Western Australia. Meninga&#x27;s men then began their 2016 Four Nations campaign with comfortable 42-point win over Scotland, in the first ever meeting between the two countries. After a tough encounter with New Zealand, and a convincing win over England, Australia met their Trans-Tasman rivals once again in the final. Meninga&#x27;s Roos made the final tournament match look easy, as the Kangaroos dominated their opponents with a 26-point victory, claiming their third tournament title in the process.

In the last ever scheduled Anzac Test, captain Cameron Smith became just the second player to play 50 tests for Australia, behind former captain, and record cap holder, Darren Lockyer. He became the first Australian to wear the gold chevron on his shoulder after a new initiative created by Meninga last year. Other players are also honoured, with players that have earned 20+ caps wearing a white chevron, 30+ wearing a bronze chevron, and 40+ wearing a silver chevron on their shoulder. If a player beats Lockyer&#x27;s record for the most appearances, they will wear a &#x27;special purple&#x27; commemorative jersey. Australia won the final Anzac test-match by a convincing scoreline of 30–12. Later in the year, countries were preparing for the grandest stage in the international game, the World Cup. However, the biggest talking point wasn&#x27;t about whether Australia would defend their title. It was around Tonga, after many players of Tongan heritage, had quit the opportunity to represent the New Zealand squad in order to play for Tonga. Regular Australian prop forward, Andrew Fifita, also followed suit, after initially being announced in Meninga&#x27;s squad, to the disapproval of Australian halfback Cooper Cronk. Meninga, however, also voiced his opinion saying he had no issue with Fifita&#x27;s decision, as it was great for Tonga, and the international game. After conceding early, Australia went on to grit out a tough victory over England. The Kangaroos then went on to beat a spirited French team, in a game which saw Wade Graham became the seventh player to equal the record of four tries in a World Cup game, and only the second Australian forward to score four tries in a single game, since Gorden Tallis in 2000. Australia finished off their pool stage games, with a comprehensive victory over a gallant Lebanese outfit. Australia then advanced past Samoa to the semi-finals with ease, thanks to a record-breaking five tries in a single World Cup match from Valentine Holmes. Holmes then remarkably beat his own record a week later, in the semi-finals against Fiji. With the six tries, he surpassed former Kangaroo, Wendell Sailor&#x27;s, record for most tries in a single World Cup tournament, held since 2000. In the final, Australia took on England for the first time in 22 years, after facing New Zealand for three consecutive editions. The Kangaroos went on to retain the World Cup at Lang Park in Brisbane, the venue, at which they lost the World Cup final, when the tournament was last held in Australia. Australia also became the first team to win 11 World Cup crowns. The final score of 6–0, made this the lowest scoring World Cup final in the history of the tournament. This was also the first time that a country had won the competition on home soil in 40 years.

On 20 October 2018, for the first time in history, Australia played a Test match against Tonga. In front of a sold-out crowd at Mt. Smart Stadium in Auckland, the Kangaroos withstood a spirited challenge from the Mate Ma&#x27;a to win 34–16.

On 2 November 2019 in front of 25,257, Tonga beat Australia for the first time in their history, which marked the first time Australia had lost to a Tier 2 side since the system came in and the first time they&#x27;d lost to a team which wasn&#x27;t New Zealand, Great Britain or England since 1978.

=== 2020s ===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Rugby League World Cup was delayed until the end of 2022. Throughout 2022, several NRL players with international heritage opting to play for their home nation during the World Cup, including Jarome Luai, Brian To&#x27;o and Joseph Sua’ali’i for Samoa, Felise Kafusi for Tonga, and Viliame Kikau, Apisai Koroisau, and Maika Sivo for Fiji. Mal Meninga named his 24-man squad on 5 October, with James Tedesco named as captain after previously playing for Italy in the 2017 World Cup. 

The campaign kicked off against Fiji at Emerald Headingley Stadium, winning 42–8, with debutants Jeremiah Nanai, Angus Crichton, and Harry Grant crossing for tries, Josh Addo-Carr getting a double, and Cameron Munster winning man of the match. The Kangaroos then crushed a hapless Scotland side 84–0 at Coventry Building Society Arena, with Addo-Carr scoring four tries, including a last-minute try off a no-look between the legs flick from Addo-Carr&#x27;s Bulldogs teammate Matt Burton. Burton, Nathan Cleary, Isaah Yeo and Campbell Graham all scored tries on debut, with Addo-Carr also receiving man of the match. Meninga named his squad for Australia on 27 October, pairing together Cleary and Daly-Cherry Evans in the halves. The two had been in contention to be Meninga&#x27;s first-choice halfback. Australia then went on to beat Italy 66–6 at Totally Wicked Stadium, with Tedesco scoring a try against his former team and Campbell Graham scoring a double. Australia won their 12th World Cup title, defeating Samoa 30–10 in the final.

===War cry===
From 1908 to 1967, the Australian team performed a war cry before Tests played in Great Britain and France. The war cry was first performed when the Kangaroos arrived at Tilbury Docks near London. It was developed after war cries had been performed on tours of Britain by the New Zealand All Blacks in 1905, the South African Springboks in 1906 and the New Zealand All Golds in 1907. It is believed that the war cry is derived from an indigenous chant on Stradbroke Island, Queensland, Australia.

The war cry was performed for the first time in over 40 years before the Rugby League World Cup exhibition game between the Indigenous Dreamtime Team and the New Zealand Māori in 2008.

===Supporters===
The main supporter group of the Australian national team is called the Roo Crew.

<text>Greenwitch is a contemporary fantasy novel by Susan Cooper, published by Atheneum Press in 1974. It is the third entry in the five book &quot;Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
The Drew children – Simon, Jane, and Barney – return to Cornwall with their uncle Merriman Lyon. Merriman enlists them along with Will Stanton, his protégé, to recover a golden grail needed to defeat the forces of the Dark.

== Themes ==
The book draws heavily on Celtic mythology and Arthurian legend, as well as Classical mythology. The figure of the &quot;Greenwitch&quot;, and the associated all-female festival attended by Jane, has been compared to female fertility rites in European mythology.

== Critical reception ==
The book received mixed to positive reviews from critics. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as &quot;breathtakingly impressive&quot;, but criticized the conflict between good and evil as being overly abstract. Both Rebecca Fisher of &quot;Fantasy Literature&quot; and Tara L. Rivera of Common Sense Media praised Cooper&#x27;s writing, but similarly criticized the interactions between Will and the Drew Children. Susan Davie of the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; described Will&#x27;s presence in the novel as &quot;superfluous.&quot;

Karen Patricia Smith has written &quot;&quot;Greenwitch&quot;, the third book in the series, is quite different in mood from the earlier books. In this dreamlike novel set in Cornwall, magic often occurs during the hours of darkness and yet readers are not left with the feeling that experiences have been merely imagined. The Greenwitch, a figure created by village women, comes into possession of a great secret coveted by the powers of Light and Dark. Young Jane&#x27;s innocence moves the creature to release the secret. Jane is an interesting figure because at first she appears to be a rather flat character who reacts according to convention. Yet as the story progresses, we learn that even those who are skilled and knowledgeable in fighting the powers of the Dark are powerless in this instance. Ironically it is Jane who is successful, not through dramatic means, but rather through communicating her compassion for the Greenwitch.&quot;

<doc id="951982" wikidata="Q9347565" url="?curid=951982" title="Said Zahari">
<text>Said Zahari ( – ) was a Singaporean writer and journalist. He was a former editor-in-chief of the Malay language newspaper &quot;Utusan Melayu&quot;, and an advocate of unbiased freedom of the press. Although he resided in Malaysia with his family, he insisted on retaining his Singapore citizenship.

==Early life==
Said was born in Singapore to Javanese parents. He led a journalists&#x27; strike against the takeover of the newspaper by United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).

At the time Utusan Melayu, founded by Yusof Ishak, was a progressive newspaper at the time and not a government propaganda instrument. 

Also known as &quot;Pak Said&quot;, he was detained on 2 February 1963 at 4.30 am by the Singapore Government and subsequently held for 17 years without trial. Allegations against him included being a &quot;Communist&quot;. He now holds the distinction of being the second longest-serving political detainee in Singapore after Chia Thye Poh.

He was arrested during Operation Coldstore, a joint Malaysian and Singaporean operation to silence 117 opposition and union leaders under the Internal Security Act.

A documentary made by film maker Martyn See about his 17 years as a political prisoner in Singapore was banned by the Board of Film Censors under the Films Act, which prohibit its possession and distribution.

In the documentary, Zahari recounts the events that follows his election as chairman of Parti Rakyat Singapura on the night before Operation Coldstore. 

He details his subsequent detention where he was kept in solitary confinement for long period in poor condition and explicitly threatened with death if he did not choose to confess his alleged crimes and cooperate with the authority. Part of the film shows Zahari conversing with the interviewer in fluent Mandarin, which he was taught during his forced detention without trial by fellow Chinese educated detainees, who were in the majority.

In a Singapore government media release highlighting the ban, it was stated that the documentary in question, &quot;gives a distorted and misleading portrayal of Said Zahari&#x27;s arrest and detention under the Internal Security Act in 1963&quot;.

He wrote about his experience in two books, &quot;Dark Clouds at Dawn: a Political Memoir&quot; (2001) dan &quot;The Long Nightmare: My 17 Years as a Political Prisoner&quot; (2007). 

Amnesty International recognizes Zahari as a former &quot;prisoner of conscience.&quot;

==Personal life==
Said Zahari married Salamah Adul Wahab in 1955. He had 2 sons and 2 daughters.

Said Zahari died on 12 April 2016 at 12.30 pm (UTC+08:00) in Malaysia; his death was announced by his son Norman Said on his Facebook post.

==Legacy==
In 2019, the Pusat Sejarah Rakyat launched the Said Zahari Young Journalist of the Year award, which was established to encourage young journalists with a special focus on social justice and human rights issues.

Among the winners were Chew Huiyee for “Once sea nomads, now stateless“ (2019), Zaim Aiman Ibrahim for “Pesawah buat benih sendiri untuk lawan kartel padi” (2020), Law Yao Hua for “Cut, Carved and Cleared, When Big Forests Go” (2021) and Liani MK for “Amid Tourism Push, Malaysia Keeps Binational Families Apart” (2022).

<doc id="951986" wikidata="Q1363423" url="?curid=951986" title="USS Connecticut (SSN-22)">
<text>USS &quot;Connecticut&quot; (SSN-22) is a nuclear powered fast attack submarine operated by the United States Navy. &quot;Connecticut&quot; is the fifth active United States Ship to be named for the U.S. state of Connecticut, going back to 1776. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 3 May 1991 and her keel was laid down on 14 September 1992. She was launched on 1 September 1997, sponsored by Patricia L. Rowland, wife of the Governor of Connecticut, John G. Rowland, and commissioned on 11 December 1998.

==History==
1999 was spent conducting shakedown operations that evaluated &quot;Connecticut&quot; weapons systems, sensors, stealth and engineering proficiency. She participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 2-99 as an opposing force asset, and completed acoustic trials, a shallow water exercise, and an anti-submarine warfare exercise.

In September 1999 &quot;Connecticut&quot; began a Post-Shakedown Availability (PSA) at the Electric Boat shipyard. Despite a 100% growth in the amount of PSA work, making this the submarine force&#x27;s most demanding PSA, &quot;Connecticut&quot; completed all work ahead of schedule. This PSA concluded as the safest in the 100-year history of Electric Boat.

In April 2003, &quot;Connecticut&quot; surfaced through the Arctic ice at the University of Washington&#x27;s Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station (APLIS). While there, she encountered a polar bear, which gnawed on her rudder for a while before disengaging.
On 31 March 2004 &quot;Connecticut&quot; put to sea in support of the War on Terror as part of the Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG), returning to NSB New London on 2 September with a pierside band blasting Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;. For the next three years, &quot;Connecticut&quot; was largely confined to port as she underwent a prolonged maintenance cycle.

In early 2007, it was announced that &quot;Connecticut&quot; would be transferred to Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton, in Washington&#x27;s Puget Sound, following a six-month deployment commencing on 25 July 2007. She would be the last of the Navy&#x27;s three &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class submarines to be transferred from New London to Kitsap as part of a larger U.S. Navy realignment shifting 60% of the fleet&#x27;s submarines to the Pacific. Upon arrival at Kitsap on 30 January 2008, &quot;Connecticut&quot; joined her &quot;Seawolf&quot; sisters in Submarine Development Squadron Five.
In early 2011, &quot;Connecticut&quot; participated in ICEX 2011 to &quot;train today’s submarines in the challenging Arctic environment&quot;, as well as &quot;refine and validate procedures and required equipment.&quot;

&quot;Connecticut&quot; received extensive overhauls from 2012 to 2017. She returned to operation in early 2018 and participated in the Arctic ICEX 2018 operational readiness exercise. Later that year she deployed to the western Pacific before returning on 30 January 2019.

From 26 March through 19 August 2019, &quot;Connecticut&quot; underwent maintenance and modernizing in a drydock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The US$17 million project involved 30,000 worker days, and used a hull-climbing robot to inspect the ship&#x27;s hull.

The Navy plans to extend a submarine pier to moor &quot;Connecticut&quot; and together with at Naval Submarine Base Bangor.

==2021 pier and seamount collisions ==
On 14 April 2021 during pre-deployment training, &quot;Connecticut&quot; hit a pier in Point Loma, California, prompting a separate command investigation and a navigation safety stand down for the boat.

On 2 October 2021 &quot;Connecticut&quot; was damaged after she collided with a seamount while maneuvering in the South China Sea. About eleven sailors sustained injuries, though none were reported to be life threatening. The submarine&#x27;s propulsion system were said to be operating normally. After an investigation, the commanding officer, his executive officer, and the chief of the boat were all relieved of duty.

The US Navy intends to repair the submarine, with work to begin in 2023 and a planned repair time frame of 31 months, returning to service in September 2025.

<doc id="951987" wikidata="Q3283906" url="?curid=951987" title="Over Sea, Under Stone">
<text>Over Sea, Under Stone is a contemporary fantasy novel written for children by the English author Susan Cooper, first published in London by Jonathan Cape in 1965. Cooper wrote four sequels about ten years later, making it the first volume in a series usually called &quot;The Dark Is Rising Sequence&quot; (1965 to 1977). In contrast to the rest of the series, it is more a mystery, with traditional fantasy elements mainly the subject of hints later in the narrative. Thus it may ease readers into the fantasy genre.

==Plot==
&quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; features the Drew children, Simon, Jane and Barney, on holiday with their parents and Merriman Lyon, an old family friend, usually referred to by the children as their great-uncle. The Drew family meet him in the fictional fishing village of Trewissick on the southern coast of Cornwall. In the attic of the big Grey House they are renting from Merriman&#x27;s friend Captain Toms the children find an old manuscript. They recognise a drawing of the local coastline that may be a kind of map, with almost illegible text, but Barney realises that the map refers to King Arthur and his knights. The children decide to keep the discovery to themselves.

The family are visited at the Grey House by a very friendly Mr. Withers and his sister Polly, who invite them to go fishing on their yacht. The boys are thrilled, but Jane feels suspicious and declines to join them. While Jane is alone in the Grey House she finds a guidebook to Trewissick, written by the local vicar, in an old trunk. She realises that the map in the guidebook is similar to the secret map, but also different somehow, so she decides to visit the vicar. The man at the vicarage is not the writer of the guidebook, but he offers to help Jane. He asks some probing questions that arouse Jane&#x27;s suspicions and she decides to return home.

Soon the house is burgled, with attention paid only to the bookshelves and the wall hangings, and the children guess that someone else knows of and seeks the manuscript. The children decide that it is time to confide in Great-Uncle Merry. Up on the headland they show him the map, and he tells them that it is a copy of an even older map that shows the way to a hidden treasure and that the children are now in great danger. He explains that some British artefact may have been hidden here long ago, and confirms that they will have dangerous grown-up rivals in its pursuit. So begins their quest for the Grail on behalf of the Light, which they have to achieve while being harried by Mr. Withers and his sister, who are agents of the Dark, desperate to stop them at any cost.

Mother usually paints outdoors, and father goes boating, or both travel out of town. Meanwhile, the children investigate the meaning of the map, encouraged, yet warned and sometimes &quot;guarded&quot;, by Great Uncle Merry. They learn to read the diagram and work out the clues on the map, but they must work out of doors, where each child has a nasty encounter with the Dark and their progress is easy to observe. While looking for the first clue Simon is chased by Mr. Hastings and Bill Hoover Jr. After the second clue leads them to the headland at night Simon, Jane and Great-Uncle Merry are ambushed and almost caught by followers of the Dark. Merriman is misdirected out of town, but the children anxiously follow their ancient guide &quot;over sea and under stone&quot; without him. Barney is kidnapped by Mr. Withers and his sister Polly, and must be rescued. The children eventually follow the clues to a cave beneath the headland and discover the Grail. Unfortunately they lose an important metal case that was lodged inside the Grail, which contained a coded manuscript that is the key to deciphering the markings on the outside of the Grail.

The children present the Grail to the British Museum and are given a cheque for it. The Grail is an object of debate among the scholars there because of the unknown markings. Barney begins to suspect something, reciting in his mind the name of the great-uncle Merry and eventually finding a link to Merlin.

==Origins==
Beside the Matter of Britain, the novel is rooted in Susan Cooper&#x27;s childhood. Trewissick is based directly on the actual village of Mevagissey, which she frequented on her own holidays. The (former) vicarage, where Jane Drew has the first nasty encounter with Mr. Hastings, is based on the (former) vicarage Mevagissey House.

&quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; came as a response to a contest designed to honour the memory of E. Nesbit. Joel Chaston writes that the contest was &quot;offered by E. Nesbit&#x27;s publisher, Ernest Benn, for family-adventure stories like those written by Nesbit. Cooper did not enter the contest but eventually completed the manuscript. After it was turned down by twenty or more publishers, she sent it to a friend of a friend who was reading manuscripts for Jonathan Cape, who published it in 1965.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==

Successful soon after publication, the novel was well received by the literary world.

Among narratives intended for children it features fairly sophisticated use of English, with an extensive vocabulary and complex sentence structures.

Joel Chaston writes, &quot;Reviewers noted that the book begins as a mystery-adventure story and becomes a sort of morality tale full of mysticism and elements of Arthurian legend. Because it later became a part of a series, &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; has continued to gain new readers. In a 1976 &quot;Horn Book&quot; essay, &quot;A Second Look: Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;, Dwight Dudley Carlson argues that Cooper&#x27;s superb abilities as a storyteller, the novel&#x27;s clear delineation of good and evil, and the believability of the Drew children have contributed to its lasting success with young readers.&quot;

==TV adaptation==
In 1969, the BBC&#x27;s Jackanory series featured a 5-part adaptation of &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;. David Wood appeared as the storyteller, while dramatised sequences included Graham Crowden as Uncle Merry and Colin Jeavons as The Black Vicar. No episodes survive in the BBC archives.

== Radio adaptation ==
In 1995 Armada Productions adapted &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; for BBC Radio 4 as part of its Children&#x27;s Radio 4 strand, and followed in 1997 with an adaptation of its sequel &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; (both under their original titles). Each comprised four half-hour episodes with few changes from the book. Ronald Pickup (familiar to many as the voice of Aslan in the BBC Narnia TV adaptations) voiced Merriman Lyon while Struan Roger portrayed Mr. Hastings, Mr. Mitothin, and The Rider.

&quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; was repeated once in 1997 a few months before &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; and again in November 2016 by BBC Radio 4 Extra. It has never been made commercially available.

<text>Amontons is a tiny lunar impact crater in the western half of the Mare Fecunditatis. It is a circular, cup-shaped formation that has been excavated out of the level surface by the impact, and is the same dark hue as the surrounding mare. When the sun is at a low angle, multiple ghost-craters are visible in the mare surface to the south-southeast and north of it.

<doc id="951990" wikidata="Q332995" url="?curid=951990" title="Walter Monckton">
<text>Walter Turner Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, (17 January 1891 – 9 January 1965) was a British lawyer and politician.

==Early years==
Monckton was born in the village of Plaxtol in north Kent. He was the eldest child of paper manufacturer Frank William Monckton (1861–1924), and his wife, Dora Constance (d. 1915). He was head boy of his preparatory school, The Knoll, at Woburn Sands in Buckinghamshire, and attended Harrow School from 1904 to 1910. He played cricket for Harrow against Eton in the famous Fowler&#x27;s match in 1910. He chose to enter Balliol College, Oxford, as a commoner, despite in 1910 having won an Exhibition to Hertford College. Whilst at Oxford, he played a first-class match for the combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities cricket team in 1911. In 1912 he obtained a third class in Classical Moderations and in 1914 a second in modern history. He was elected president of the Oxford Union in 1913.

==Career==
Monckton was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1919. In 1927 he was appointed legal advisor to the Simon Commission. He took silk in 1930.

Monckton served as advisor to King Edward VIII during the abdication crisis, having been Attorney General to the Duchy of Cornwall since 1932. He was Recorder of Hythe from 1930 to 1937. Thanks to his royal connections, he was appointed constitutional advisor to the last Nizam of Hyderabad.

He worked in propaganda and information during the Second World War and became Solicitor General in Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1945 caretaker government, although he refused to join the Conservative Party.

After the 1945 general election, Monckton returned to legal practice. He also continued to serve as advisor to the Nizam of Hyderabad.

He finally joined the Conservative Party after the war and became a Member of Parliament for Bristol West at a 1951 by-election. Churchill soon appointed him to the cabinet as Minister of Labour and National Service, in which post he served from 1951 to 1955. He was Anthony Eden&#x27;s Minister of Defence from 1955 to 1956, but was the only cabinet minister to oppose his Suez policy, and was moved in October to the post of Paymaster General, serving until the change of administration in early 1957.

Monckton was created Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, &quot;of Brenchley in the County of Kent&quot; on 11 February 1957. He had wanted to become Lord Chief Justice of England and indeed had been promised the job by Churchill and the two subsequent prime ministers, but in 1957 he decided instead to join the board of Midland Bank.

Monckton was chairman of Midland Bank (1957–1964), President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (1956–1957) despite reportedly once describing the club&#x27;s main committee as making the Tory Cabinet look like &quot;a band of pinkos&quot;, President of Surrey County Cricket Club (1950–1952 and 1959–1965), Chairman of the Iraq Petroleum Company (1958), and Chancellor of the University of Sussex (1961–1965).

In 1960 he headed the Monckton Commission (sometimes known as the &quot;Advisory Commission on Central Africa&quot;), whose report concluded that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland could not be maintained except by force or through massive changes in racial legislation. It advocated a majority of African members in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures and giving these territories the option to leave the Federation after five years.

==Personal life==

He married Polly Colyer-Fergusson, daughter of Sir Thomas Colyer-Fergusson, the family who owned Ightham Mote, Sevenoaks. In 1947, he married, secondly, Bridget Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland, CBE, the wartime head of the ATS counterpart in India, the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (India), and also of the Women&#x27;s Royal Indian Naval Service (WRINS).

He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his son Gilbert, born of his first marriage, on his death in 1965 at the age of 73.

<text>Boethius is a small lunar impact crater located on the east edge of Mare Undarum near the eastern lunar limb. To the southwest is the dark, lava-flooded crater Dubyago.

Boethius is circular and cup-shaped, with inner walls sloping down to the tiny central floor. It has a higher albedo than the surrounding terrain, and is not overlain by other impact craters of note. It was named after the Roman philosopher Boethius. Before 1976, it was identified as Dubyago U.

<text>Ascend Communications, Inc. was an Alameda, California-based manufacturer of communications equipment that was later purchased by Lucent Technologies in 1999.

Ascend Communications was founded in 1988 and taken public in 1994. Initial investors included Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield and Byers (KPCB); Greylock Partners; and New Enterprise Associates (NEA).

Ascend Communications designed and manufactured equipment for high-density dialup installations, most notably the &quot;MAX TNT&quot;, which allowed for a DS3 of dialup lines to be terminated in a few rack units. Customers such as AOL, Earthlink, Demon Internet, and UUnet purchased over two million dialup ports worth of &quot;MAX TNT&quot; access servers during the dialup days of the internet. Many companies still use &quot;MAX TNT&quot; for dialup (look for &quot;TNT&quot; in dialup hostnames). In the mid-1990s, the company was one of the leading vendors of ISDN modems and concentrators.

Ascend Communications also acquired several companies. In 1996, it acquired NetStar, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based publicly traded manufacturer of ultra-high-performance, switched backplane, backbone routers capable 16 Gbit/s throughput. 

In 1997, Ascend acquired Cascade Communications. Cascade designed and manufactured high-density carrier packet switches, including the B-STDX9000 frame relay switch and the CBX-500 and GX-550 ATM switches. The B-STDX and CBX/GX lines were the workhorses of most RBOC Frame Relay and ATM networks throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century.

In February 1997, Ascend released the DSLPipe series.

In August 1998, Ascend bought Stratus Computers for $822 million in stock. Stratus was primarily a maker of fault-tolerant computer systems but it owned a Service Control Point technology critical to the convergence of voice and data networks that Ascend valued. The server business was sold off to private equity investors within months, following the Lucent deal. It now operates as Stratus Technologies.

The company was acquired by Lucent Technologies in 1999. The $24 billion merger was the largest technology merger in history up to that time.

Ascend&#x27;s stock traded under the Nasdaq symbol &quot;ASND&quot;.

<text>Samy Sorge (; born 19 December 1977), commonly known as Samy Deluxe, Wickeda MC or Sam Semillia, is a German rapper and record producer from Hamburg.

== Early life ==
Samy was two years old when his [
Sudanese father left Germany. Samy grew up with his mother&#x27;s family. His half-sister was born shortly after his father left. The family lived in Barmbek for many years, then moved to Eppendorf, a better-off part of Hamburg. His family was able to make the move upon the recommendation of a family friend after his mother remarried. He attended the Wolfgang-Borchert-Schule and attained the &quot;Realschulabschluss&quot;, or certificate of general education similar to a British GCSE. He cites his upbringing in a middle-class neighbourhood as part of his inspiration. He says he felt out of place: &quot;At (one) point I would stand out in front of my own house and people who lived here before me would ask, &#x27;Can I help you?. Additionally, he cites American rappers as his inspiration rather than their German counterparts. Samy recalls that his interest in rap music began as early as 1988.

== Music career ==

In 2001, Samy Deluxe released his self-titled debut album, which ranked No. 2 in the German Album Charts for the 19th calendar week of 2001. The first single from the album, &quot;Hab&#x27; gehört...&quot;, ranked No. 26. However, the second single, &quot; Love&quot;, failed to enter the charts. The final single, &quot;Weck mich auf&quot;, peaked at No. 4 in Germany, becoming a national hit and the album&#x27;s most successful single.
Following the success of his solo debut, Samy Deluxe became a highly acclaimed hip hop artist in German rap and internationally.

In 2003, Samy Deluxe founded the rap duo ASD with fellow rapper Afrob. They released their debut &quot;Wer hätte das gedacht&quot;. The lead single from the album, &quot;Sneak Preview&quot;, ranked successfully on the German charts. Most of the beats on this album came from American producers, including J Dilla, Diamond D and Waajeed.

In August 2004, Samy Deluxe released his second solo album, &quot;Verdammtnochma!&quot;. The album peaked at No. 2 on the German album-charts shortly thereafter and stayed for three weeks in the Top 10. In the same year, he was featured on the German remix of &quot;Dip It Low&quot; by American singer Christina Milian, which was a commercial success.

In 2005, Samy Deluxe represented Hamburg in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005, with the song &quot;Generation&quot;, placing ninth with 44 points.

In April 2016, Samy Deluxe released his sixth solo album, &quot;Berühmte letzte Worte&quot; (&quot;Famous last words&quot;). The album peaked at No. 4 on the German album-charts. In the same month, he joined Xavier Naidoo to perform one of the new tracks, &quot;Haus am Mehr&quot; (&quot;House by the ocean&quot;, but written as wordplay for &quot;more&quot; instead of &quot;Meer&quot;), in the TV show &quot;Sing meinen Song&quot; (&quot;Sing my song&quot;). Features on the album came from Nena, Afrob, Max Herre and many others.

In May 2019, Samy Deluxe appeared on MTV unplugged with Max Raabe.

== Business ventures ==

In 2006, Samy Deluxe, in collaboration with Reebok, designed sneakers and a cap with New Era Cap Company. On the cover of his mixtape &quot;Deluxe von Kopf bis Fuß&quot;, he wore clothes, especially designed for him. In 2007 followed two more sneakers, so that four Reebok sneakers were developed for the &quot;Samy Deluxe&quot; series.

<text>The HP-12C is a financial calculator made by Hewlett-Packard (HP) and its successor HP Inc. as part of the HP Voyager series, introduced in 1981. It is HP&#x27;s longest and best-selling product and is considered the &quot;de facto standard&quot; among financial professionals. There have been multiple revisions over the years, with newer revisions moving to an ARM processor running a software emulator of the original Nut processor. Critics claim that its 1980s technology is antiquated, but proponents point out that it is still the de facto and de jure standard in finance.

== Functionality ==
The HP-12C is HP&#x27;s longest and best-selling product, in continual production since its introduction in 1981. Due to its simple operation for key financial calculations, the calculator long ago became the &quot;de facto standard&quot; among financial professionals. Its popularity has endured despite the fact that a relatively simple but iterative process such as amortizing the interest over the life of a loan, a calculation that modern spreadsheets can complete almost instantly, can take over a minute with the HP-12C. The 1977 October edition of the &quot;HP Journal&quot; contains an article by Roy Martin, the inventor of the simple method of operation used in HP financial calculators, which describes, in detail, the mathematics and functionality built by William Kahan and Roy Martin that is still used today.

==Models==

===HP-12C===
There were at least nine hardware revisions of the HP-12C since 1981 (including one special issue). Over its lifespan, the proprietary bulk CMOS HP Nut (originally the 1LF5, then 1LM2) processor&#x27;s technology has been redesigned to integrate all the circuitry into a single chip (first the 1LQ9, then 1RR2) and to refresh the manufacturing process (as the foundry could no longer manufacture the necessary chips, having moved on to making higher-density chips). However, HP&#x27;s market research found in the late 1980s that users did not trust results obtained too quickly and so the CPU speed was never improved from the original 884 kHz, but the speed could be increased by a user modification. In 2001 (from serial number CN11500001), the CPU was changed to a 3 V process (Agilent 2AF1-0001, later a Marvell 2AF1-0002) and the battery was therefore changed to a single CR2032 cell replacing the three LR44 cells previously used (F1637A).

In 2008, HP modified the design to use an Atmel AT91SAM7L128 processor with ARM7TDMI core running a software emulator of the previous Nut processor, written by Cyrille de Brébisson, in order to execute an image of the former Nut-based firmware in it. This has brought advanced possibilities such as flashing new firmware, not previously possible. HP also released a software development kit (SDK), making it possible to make new and custom operating systems. The calculator ran 60–90 times faster on most benchmark operations. This version (F2230A) was colloquially known as the &quot;HP-12C+&quot;, although HP did not market it as a different product. In contrast to the preceding revision, it supported two parallel CR2032 cells, of which only one was necessary to run the calculator.

Based on the same processor, a limited &quot;HP 12c 30th Anniversary Edition&quot; (NW258AA) was introduced in 2011. Only 40,000 of this model were made.

The internal hardware of the HP-12C changed again in 2015, when the design switched to use an Atmel ATSAM4LC2CA-AU processor with ARM Cortex-M4 core. The calculator&#x27;s part number and physical appearance didn&#x27;t change except for a &quot;Rev 2&quot; plate on the bottom side. It continues to use two parallel CR2032 cells. The firmware reports a 2015 build date. Serial numbers starting with &quot;PHA&quot;, &quot;9CJ&quot;, &quot;7CD&quot;, or &quot;3CD&quot; rule out the older model variant. The 2×3-pin flash port now uses the USB protocol instead of a TTL serial protocol; in addition to this, the calculator&#x27;s circuit board features an unpopulated mount for a Micro-USB connector.
In 2022, the HP Development Company, L.P.&#x27;s licensees Moravia Consulting spol. s r.o. and Royal Consumer Information Products, Inc. released a minor revision of the HP 12C without &quot;Hewlett-Packard&quot; on the frontplate and with a screw added to the battery compartment cover.

The HP-12C is one of only four calculators permissible in the Chartered Financial Analyst exams, the others being its sister, the HP 12c Platinum, and the Texas Instruments BA II Plus and BA II Plus Professional.

Often referred to as a tool for &quot;Old-ie Time-ies,&quot; critics of the HP-12C claim its early 1980s technology and style are antiquated. Proponents, however, are quick to note that the HP-12C continues to be both the &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; standard of high finance.

===HP 12c Platinum / Prestige===
The &quot;HP 12c Platinum&quot; is similar in appearance and functionality to the 12C, and is designed to mimic the 12C whilst extending its capabilities in various aspects. The calculator was introduced in 2003, is visibly distinguished by its silver-colored upper half as opposed to the gold-colored plate on the original 12c. There are six variants of the HP 12c Platinum (including two special issues).

The first release of the 12c Platinum used a faster processor than the revision of the original HP-12C which was available at that time. (However, the subsequent revisions of the original 12C which switched to ARM-based processors have reversed that speed gap.) It was equipped with a Sunplus SPLB20D2 with a 6502 core, larger memory (for up to 30 CFj registers and 400 program steps) and more built-in functions. It allows input to be entered in algebraic mode as well as in 4-level classical RPN. The calculator&#x27;s particular implementation of RPN exhibits an unusual behaviour of the key different from that of the 12C and other classical RPN calculators.

The first HP 12c Platinum version (F2231A) did not have parentheses, which often led to awkward key sequences to solve problems in algebraic mode. Since 2005, newer versions (F2232A) of the HP 12c Platinum have parentheses on the blue-shifted functions of the STO and RCL keys. They also support undo and backspace and provide memory for up to 80 CFj registers. The firmware changes increased the ROM size beyond the capabilities of the original processor, so it was replaced by the Generalplus GPLB31A (still with 6502 core), which is also faster. It was manufactured by Kinpo Electronics.

In 2006, Hewlett-Packard released a limited edition of the 12c Platinum to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original 12C&#x27;s introduction. The &quot;HP 12c Platinum 25th Anniversary Edition&quot; also has the parentheses feature and features the GPLB31A processor as well.

The latest hardware revision of the 12c Platinum was introduced in 2007 (F2231AA). As in the later revisions of the 12C, it features two parallel rather than only one CR2032 cells, but it continues to be based on the GPLB31A processor. In 2008, the &quot;HP 12c Prestige&quot; (F2233A) was released. It features a gold-colored plate like the original 12C, but is otherwise like the fourth HP 12c Platinum model (F2231AA). In 2022, alongside the latest revision of the original 12C, Moravia and Royal also released a mostly cosmetic update of the 12c Platinum, with the words &quot;Hewlett-Packard&quot; removed from the frontplate, subtle adjustments to the layout and contact information on the rearplate, and a screw added to the battery compartment.

== Bugs and problems ==
By design, the HP-12C rounds up the number of payments to the next integer, which produces meaningless results when calculating fractional periods. Consequently, solving for &quot;n&quot; returns a value that is mathematically incorrect when compared to the standard annuity formula and different from the value returned by other financial calculators, Excel, etc.

==Clones==
The &quot;Aurora FN1000&quot; calculator in clamshell design was closely inspired by the HP-12C in 2003. Capitalizing on the limited availability of the HP 12c Platinum 25th Anniversary Edition, Victor Technology released the &quot;Victor V12&quot; in 2007 which was a budget priced clone of the HP 12c Platinum edition. It is also available as &quot;BrtC FC-12&quot; in Brazil. The 2010 &quot;Compucessory CCS28956&quot; aka &quot;Compucessory 28956&quot;, a clamshell design, is another clone of the HP 12c Platinum, but with added margin calculation functions (COST, SELL, MGN). It is also available as &quot;Procalc FN 1200C&quot; in Brazil. The &quot;Truly SC123&quot; in 2015 closely resembles the HP 12c Platinum as well, but in a vertical case layout.

In 2012, SwissMicros (aka RPN-Calc) introduced a miniature clone named &quot;DM-12CC&quot; approximating the size of an ID-1 credit card (88 mm × 59 mm × 7 mm). It closely emulates the functionality of the original HP-12C by running the original ROM image in an emulator on an ARM Cortex-M0-based NXP LPC1114 processor. Newer &quot;DM12&quot; models since 2013 feature a better keyboard and more RAM (LPC1115). A &quot;DM12 Silver Edition&quot; in a titanium case is available as well. 
In February 2016, SwissMicros introduced the DM12L, a version of the calculator about the same size as the original HP-12C.
Deviating from the HP original, these calculators feature a dot-matrix display, switchable fonts and clock speeds, and, based on a Silicon Labs CP2102 converter chip, they come with a USB (Mini-B) serial interface to exchange data with a PC etc. for backup purposes (and possibly to communicate with applications like PC-based HP-12C emulators) or to update the firmware. Powering via USB is not supported.

<text>Censorinus is a 3.8 km lunar impact crater located on a rise to the southeast of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It is named after the ancient Roman writer Censorinus. To the northeast is the crater Maskelyne.

Censorinus is distinguished by an area of high-albedo material surrounding the rim. This makes the feature highly prominent when the Sun is at a high angle, and it is one of the brightest objects on the visible Moon. Bright streaks radiate away radially from the crater, and contrast with the darker lunar mare.

This formation has a sharp-edged, raised rim and a symmetrical, cup-shaped interior. Close-up photographs of this crater by Lunar Orbiter 5 show many large blocks lying along the sloping outer . The surface near the crater is hummocky from the deposited ejecta. The crater is otherwise undistinguished.

The vicinity of Censorinus was once considered for an early Apollo landing site.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Censorinus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Censorinus F — &quot;See&quot; Leakey (crater).

<doc id="952027" wikidata="Q19716677" url="?curid=952027" title="Area of archaeological potential">
<text>Areas of archaeological potential, also known as areas of high archaeological potential or urban archaeological zones, are locations within a country identified by archeologists as sites where buried archaeological artifacts are likely to survive. There are hundreds of thousands of areas of archaeological potential worldwide, yet many factors limit the excavation of them. There is a multitude of factors that contribute to these areas of archeological potential, mainly the environmental factors, but also political factors, and the history that the country holds.

== Environmental factors ==
The environmental factors which contribute to the preserving of archaeological sites are an integral component when it comes to areas of archaeological potential. The key features of areas with high archaeological potential are that they are dry, cold, and waterlogged. These three features must have stayed at a constant state throughout the entirety of their existence, for the archaeological find to remain in a stable state. There are many specific features that contribute to areas of archaeological potential, but the key component is that the environmental factors remained at a constant state throughout the entirety of their existence. Determining which areas will be of archaeological potential is not limited to what areas have the best environmental factors but also which areas will give offer a contribution to “the knowledge of world culture and human behaviour”.

== Current areas ==

=== Egypt ===

Due to Egypt&#x27;s long-held historical legacy, it is one place in the world that has the highest level of archaeological potential. The main reason for the great success archaeologists have come across in Egypt is due to the careful construction of the pyramids hundreds of centuries ago. The pyramids were constructed in a period referred to as the Pyramid Age, which spanned over a thousand years, beginning in the third dynasty and ending in the Second Intermediate Period. The careful construction of these pyramids, specifically the Great Pyramid of Giza, according to Herodotus, took 100 000 men and over 20 years to build. Due to the intricate design and level of protection these pyramids hold, they have subsequently created an ideal environment for the artifacts within to withstand thousands of years. Archaeologists have been able to find an excess of information about this ancient civilisation. In this, the location of these areas in Egypt of archaeological potential are extremely dry, helping to preserve the artifacts and other monuments. Although, these sites and other stone monuments do suffer from several factors of deterioration, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind erosion and air pollution.

=== Pompeii ===

Pompeii was one of the greatest archaeological finds in history, with almost an entire, perfectly preserved Roman civilisation being excavated. The eruption of Vesuvius in 69AD covered the entire civilisation in a pyroclastic surge, a cloud of ash and superheated gases (100–499 degrees C) traveling at 100–200 kilometers an hour. This surge instantaneously killed all humans whilst covering the town in a protective layer of ash which was shortly followed by a pyroclastic surge, a ground-hugging avalanche of superheated fragments of volcanic rock and gas moving at 65–80 km an hour, which covered the entirety of the town. The town was covered, and everything inside was preserved just as it was in 69 BC. Due to this natural disaster, the town is deemed as an area of high archaeological potential. The site of Pompeii has been an incredibly useful source for understanding the daily life of Roman citizens in 69 BC. The town continues to provide evidence as archaeologists remain persistent in uncovering the entirety of the site.

=== Athens and Greece ===
Greece, specifically its islands and Athens is home to many monumental sites which have a significant legacy in the western world. Imperialism in the fifth century BC directly impacted Athens and other neighboring countries in the Aegean, and due to the imperialistic regime of Pericles, Athens and Greece itself has become an area of acute archeological potential. Pericles wanted to present an image that visually reveal the social, political, and military strength and power that Athens held over the Mediterranean. Pericles was successful and is largely attributed to the Golden Age of Greece, a time when Greece was the superpower of the Aegean. The Acropolis and other large monumental sites including the Parthenon, the Propylaea, and various statues still stand proudly over Athens today.  The most renowned archeological site in Athens is the Acropolis, built in the second half of the fifth century BC for military purposes, it quickly shifted to a place of worship for Athena, and thus was marked as a sacred site. 

The climate in Greece also played an instrumental factor in preserving archeological artifacts, much like in Egypt and Pompeii. Southern Greece enjoys what is referred to as a “Mediterranean” climate, which includes light winter rains and summer droughts. The climate doesn&#x27;t change drastically throughout the year in Greece, meaning that the multitude of artifacts do not get exposed to harsh and extreme weather conditions.

== Potential of digital archeology ==
Digital archaeology has been an integral component in recent years when determining which sites across the world hold archaeological potential. Digital advances have also shaped the world of archaeology, making excavations more efficient, effective, and purposeful. Following a successful season of field testing in 2011, the Tel Akko Total Archaeology Project (Akko, Israel) found that Agisoft&#x27;s PhotoScan Pro-one became an extremely useful tool in creating accurate 3D images of archaeological sites, providing a new outlet for the dissemination of archaeological data. There are multiple examples of the way digital archaeology has positively affected the field of archaeology, with Pompeii being one of the most successful. As a historic site with millions of visitors each year, Pompeii and Herculaneum face conservation issues, yet with the use of 3D scanning, online visual representations of the site have been made available, decreasing the deterioration of the site. Estelle Laser, an Australian Archeologist, first used CT scans on plaster casts, which in turn have helped to gain a much clearer sense of the reality of the people who died, uncovering their age, gender, health, and other important features. Laser&#x27;s work changed the story of Pompeii, dismembering the common notion that those who died at Pompeii were primarily women, children, and the elderly. Laser additionally undid the wrongdoings of Fiorelli and Spinazola.  This new information about the bodies found on the site has helped archaeologists to gain a deeper knowledge of the people of Vesuvius and their daily life.

== Political influences on archeological digs ==
Politics heavily influence archaeology and the sites that are deemed to have archaeological potential. Many countries have a rich history and idyllic conditions which all point towards archaeological potential, although politics hamper their uncovering both positively and negatively. In the case of Pompeii, politics in the early 20th century significantly damaged the site. Mussolini was in power when great excavations were taking place in Pompeii, and despite being the most productive period of excavations at the site, the damage these excavations caused was more detrimental to the site than positive. The excavations corresponded to the Fascist government of Mussolini, which exploited the potential of Italy&#x27;s past to ‘create a model for a new imperialist Italy’. Despite his wide-ranging excavations, by the time Mussolini was forced out of the office, 26 hectares of the total 66 were not excavated, and further, by the late 50s and early 60s, Pompeii was in a state of disrepair. In some circumstances, politics help archaeological digs take place. For example, in Egypt, a large amount of money is given each year to help preserve the historical monuments, as they create a large influx of tourism and therefore money. Tourism in Egypt is one of the leading sources of income for the country with US$12.57 billion produced in 2019/2018. The political agenda in Egypt has recently changed as politicians realised the importance of these monuments to not only the world but the economy. Although, in many cases, countries with high archaeological potential do not have enough money to uncover monuments and keep them in good condition.

<text>Elizabeth Marguerita Mary Kershaw (born 30 July 1958) is an English radio broadcaster. She is one of the longest serving female national radio DJs in the UK, celebrating 30 years on national BBC Radio in 2017.

==Career==
After graduating from the University of Leeds, Liz Kershaw began her media career in Leeds with a music column in the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;. Her brother is fellow broadcaster Andy Kershaw. Her first radio show was in 1981 on Radio Aire where her brother worked for a time. In 1985 she moved to BBC Radio Leeds to present a weekly rock show showcasing local bands.

In 1986 Kershaw&#x27;s day job with British Telecom saw her move to London to set up &quot;Livewire&quot;, a dial-in pop service which superseded &quot;Dial-a-Disc&quot;. In running this she produced Radio 1 DJs Mike Smith, Janice Long and Dave Pearce before devising her own show for Radio 1 in 1987, &quot;Backchat&quot;, which won several awards.

This was followed by Kershaw presenting the Radio 1 &quot;Evening Show&quot; and then, with Bruno Brookes, Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Breakfast Show&quot; and the &quot;Radio 1 Roadshow&quot; from 1989 to 1992. During this period they also made three charity records for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot; campaign.

Kershaw left Radio 1 in 1992 to present &quot;The Crunch&quot;, the UK&#x27;s first national daily phone-in on BBC Radio 5 but continued to host occasional shows on the station.

In 1994 Kershaw was part of the team which relaunched the station as BBC Radio 5 Live. In 2000 she went back to BBC Local Radio as the first and only woman in the country to present a solo radio breakfast show. This was BBC Radio Northampton&#x27;s breakfast programme, which was nominated for the Best Breakfast Show Award at the Sony Radio Awards in 2002 along with Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; Programme and the 5 Live Breakfast Show. 

===Dawn Chorus and the Blue Tits=== 
In 1984 Kershaw formed a band called Dawn Chorus and the Blue Tits with her friend and neighbour &quot;Countdown&quot; presenter Carol Vorderman. Their recordings included a version of &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; with the Undertones&#x27; O&#x27;Neill brothers (John and Damian), which was released on Stiff Records&#x27; DAWN 1. and a Peel Session which was broadcast on Radio 1 in 1985.

==Recent career==
In 2002, Kershaw was one of the original presenters on the digital station BBC Radio 6 Music where she presented the weekday afternoon show from 1.00pm-4.00pm, before moving to the weekend mid-morning slots in April 2004, from 10.00am-1.00pm.

In September 2005 Kershaw became a weekday presenter on the BBC&#x27;s BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire radio station, where she took over the Drivetime show. She later presented the weekday Breakfast Show for the station and continued to present a show on BBC Radio 6 Music, but on Saturdays only. 

In July 2007, following a complaint from Buckingham Palace about the misrepresentation of the Queen in a BBC documentary, Mark Thompson, then-Director-General of the BBC, in a public purging exercise, singled out Kershaw&#x27;s show in what became an infamous BBC scandal, announcing that some of the DJ&#x27;s shows that were aired as live were in fact pre-recorded and that members of the production team had passed themselves off as listeners texting and emailing into competitions.

It was subsequently revealed by journalists and listeners that other shows presented by Russell Brand, Jo Whiley, Tony Blackburn and Dermot O&#x27;Leary were also involved in the same endemic production practices.

On 30 July 2008, the BBC was accused by media watchdog Ofcom of &#x27;misleading its audiences&#x27; by &#x27;faking&#x27; audience interaction. Ofcom stated that the BBC &#x27;deceived its audience by faking winners of competitions and deliberately conducting competitions unfairly and fined the corporation a record £400,000 of which Kershaw&#x27;s BBC Radio 6 Music show was fined £115,000 for seventeen shows in 2005 and 2006. 

Until June 2022, she could be heard on BBC Radio 6 Music Sunday lunchtimes 1.00pm-2.00pm. She left the breakfast show at BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire on Friday 17 July 2009 when the management decided to change the hosts. 

In October 2012, Kershaw told the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Today&quot; programme that she had been routinely groped while working as a Radio1 DJ in the 1980s. She said the station had a culture that was very intimidating for a young woman.

In November 2012, Kershaw was named in a case involving the suicide of BBC journalist Russell Joslin, who had alleged that Kershaw had sexually harassed him.

In 2014, she released her autobiography, &quot;The Bird and the Beeb&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kershaw voted for Brexit and was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;an unabashed cheerleader&quot; for Boris Johnson, who she called &quot;fiercely intelligent&quot; and &quot;the best kind of Tory - a philanthropic Conservative&quot;.

In 2020, she criticised UK government period poverty measures and expressed support for the use of &quot;old rags&quot; as sanitary products. In 2023 she regularly appears and contributes on the GB News channel with current affairs.

<doc id="952045" wikidata="Q2032091" url="?curid=952045" title="Peugeot 907">
<text>The Peugeot 907 was a concept car built by Peugeot. Unveiled at the 2004 Paris Motor Show, the car was created by styling chief Gérard Welter and designer Jean Christophe Bolle Reddat to celebrate the closure of the firm’s 40-year-old design centre at La Garenne and the opening of the new centre at Vélizy. 

It was one of three concepts cars unveiled by Peugeot at the show, alongside the Quark and 1007 RC. &quot;Fleet News&quot; described this concept as “Peugeot’s answer to Ferrari’s Maranello” prior to the car&#x27;s reveal. The car was never designed to go into production, but was intended to be a prototype featuring the new design techniques by Peugeot. 

The engine is mounted just behind the front wheels, and side exhausts exit behind each of the front wheels. Unlike many concepts, the 907 can be driven like any production car. Under the bonnet, two 3.0-litre V6 engines are combined to form a 500BHP V12. 

The monocoque body is made of carbon fiber and the car uses a double-wishbone suspension all round, while the sequential-shift transmission distributes power to the rear wheels. The arcing windscreen continues upwards to form the roof, while the bonnet has a see-through perspex insert that reveals the engine’s 12 intake trumpets.

==Specifications==

* Engine: 6.0-litre, PSA V12 (based on the ES9 from the Peugeot 607)
* Transmission: six-speed transaxle rear-mounted automated manual
* Drivetrain: front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive
* Estimated top speed: 360 km/h (222 mph)
* 0–60: 3.7 seconds (estimated)

<text>Roger Ellwood Cloud (December 4, 1909 – April 20, 1988), was an American politician of the Republican party who represented Ohio in several capacities.

Having worked as a farmer and a factory worker, Cloud won election to the local school board in DeGraff. In 1940, he won office as a county commissioner in Logan County, Ohio. He served in this office from 1941 to 1949.

In 1948, Cloud ran successfully for a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives, serving from 1949. Cloud held the office of Speaker of the House from 1955 to 1959 and from 1961 to 1967.

In 1965, Ohio State Auditor Roger W. Tracy died and Governor James A. Rhodes appointed Chester W. Goble as a temporary replacement. Rhodes chose Cloud to complete Tracy&#x27;s term as auditor and in 1966, Cloud was elected to the position and served in that office from 1967 to 1971.

In 1970, Cloud was nominated for Governor of Ohio as incumbent Jim Rhodes was term-limited. He defeated Congressman Donald &quot;Buz&quot; Lukens in the primary, but lost to Democrat John J. Gilligan. That year the Ohio Republican Party was caught up in the &quot;Crofters&quot; scandal where the Republican state treasurer, John Herbert, had invested state money in improper investments with a big campaign contributor. After this defeat, Cloud retired from politics.

Cloud&#x27;s wife was the former Llewellyn DeWeese; they were married in 1934.

<text>The Miniature Pinscher, also known as the Zwergpinscher and Mini Pin, is a small breed of dog of the pinscher type originating in Germany. While the breed&#x27;s visual similarities to the Toy Manchester Terrier, which somewhat resembles the Pinscher breeds, remain a matter of controversy, genetic research (published in 2017) has shown that the two breeds have shared, unique ancestry. The ancestors of the Toy Manchester and Miniature Pinscher may have become geographically separated many centuries ago and retained similarities simply through breeding selection for the same traits; nevertheless, the 2017 research also showed that the two breeds remain more closely related to each other than to other breeds. The breed&#x27;s ancestors may also include the German Pinscher, Italian greyhounds and dachshunds. The Miniature Pinscher&#x27;s known origins are in Germany, where it was often referred to as the Zwerg Pinscher (Dwarf Biter) in historical documents. German Kennel Club documents also refer to the Miniature Pinscher as the &quot;reh&quot; Pinscher, but this term is only used for a dog of stag-red color, &quot;reh&quot; referring to a small red deer formerly found in German forests. The Miniature Pinscher originated several centuries ago as an efficient barnyard ratter.
Historical artifacts and paintings place the Miniature Pinscher as a very old breed, but factual documentation began less than 200 years ago, leaving its actual origins to debate. Many historians and those who have researched the background of the breed agree that this heritage is most likely correct, adding the shorthaired German Pinscher to the family tree. The international kennel club, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, lists the Miniature Pinscher in Group 2, Section 1.1 &quot;Pinscher&quot;, along with the Dobermann, the German Pinscher, the Austrian Pinscher, and the other Toy Pinscher, the Affenpinscher. Other kennel clubs list the Miniature Pinscher in the Toy Group or Companion Group.

==Etymology==
The misconception that the Miniature Pinscher is a &quot;miniature Doberman&quot; occurred because the Doberman Pinscher (a breed developed by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann around 1890) was introduced to the U.S. before the Miniature Pinscher. In 1919, the Miniature Pinscher was introduced to the AKC show ring. At the time, not knowing that it was referred to officially in Germany as the Zwergpinscher (little biter), the AKC referred to the breed as simply &quot;Pinscher&quot; and listed it in the miscellaneous category. When the Miniature Pinscher Club of America (MPCA) was created in 1929 (the year of the breed&#x27;s official introduction into the AKC), they petitioned for Miniature Pinschers to be placed in the Toy group. The AKC&#x27;s description, that the dog &quot;must appear as a Doberman in miniature,&quot; led to the misconception common today that this breed is a &quot;Miniature Doberman Pinscher&quot;.

The original name for this breed in the U.S. was &quot;Pinscher (Toy)&quot; until 1972 when the name was officially changed to Miniature Pinscher.

==History==
Documentation of this breed begins less than 200 years ago. They were used traditionally to hunt mice, lizards, small birds, rabbits, pests and vermin and were hunting dogs. There is a drawing by Jean Bungartz, published in 1888 comparing the Miniature Pinscher to the German Pinscher.

== Appearance ==
The Miniature Pinscher is structurally a well balanced, sturdy, compact, short-coupled, smooth-coated dog. They are naturally well groomed, vigorous and alert. Characteristic traits are their hackney-like action, fearless animation, complete self-possession, and spirited presence. Legs should be straight with no bending in or out. They are also known to have separation anxiety. The Miniature Pinscher frequently has a docked tail and cropped ears, though the AKC no longer requires ear cropping for shows. They can also sometimes have natural erect ears.

=== Size ===
According to the American Kennel Club, the Miniature Pinscher should be high with most desirable height at the highest point of the shoulder blades. Length is equal to height, though females may be slightly longer. The ideal weight is . There are also Teacup Miniature Pinschers, which are about half the size of normal Miniature Pinschers.

=== Coat and color ===
The coat is short and smooth, with no undercoat. Available colors include solid red, stag red, blue stag red, chocolate stag red, fawn stag red, as well as black, grey, chocolate, blue, and fawn with tan points or rust points. For showing in the United States, the AKC disqualifies all colors but the solid or stag red and the black or chocolate with rust points. The Pinscher-Schnauzer Club, which maintains the standard for showing in Germany, has the same restrictions. In the UK, blue with rust points is allowed in the show ring. White spots larger than half an inch or black spots on the points are disqualifications for showing in most countries. Merle is not an accepted coloring of the breed.


== Care ==
Grooming is easy, as the smooth, short-haired coat requires little attention, needing only occasional brushing and shampooing. Care must be taken in cold weather. Sweaters or baby blankets can help keep a Miniature Pinscher from getting too cold. Miniature Pinschers are an active breed and need access to a fenced yard, or be given a daily walk.
Some Miniature Pinschers are prone to becoming overweight, so it is necessary to watch calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity.

== Temperament ==
Miniature Pinschers are for experienced dog owners. Many people underestimate the care, time, and effort needed in order to raise a Miniature Pinscher. The Miniature Pinscher is an assertive, outgoing, active, and independent breed. Miniature pinschers are energetic and need a fenced yard to run in; they make great agility dogs. They are great escape artists and some recommend having a kennel with a lid on it for them to run around in. They are good watchdogs, as they are alert and wary of strangers. They can easily alert their owners of someone&#x27;s presence, their happiness or their loneliness with their frequent high-pitched bark. It is recommended that adults and teenagers, rather than young children, play with a Miniature Pinscher as younger children play rough. Miniature Pinschers are a stubborn breed when it comes to training, but once trained they will obey commands well.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.7 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 11 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.

<text>ESCON (Enterprise Systems Connection) is a data connection created by IBM, and is commonly used to connect their mainframe computers to peripheral devices such as disk storage, tape drives and IBM 3270 display controllers. ESCON is an optical fiber, half-duplex, serial interface. It originally operated at a rate of 10MB/s, which was later increased to 17MB/s. The current maximum distance is 43 kilometers.

IBM introduced ESCON in September 1990 as part of its System/390 announcement. It replaced the older, slower (4.5MB/s), copper-based, parallel, IBM System/360 Bus and Tag channels technology of 1960-1990 era mainframes. Optical fiber is smaller in diameter and weight, and hence could save installation costs. Space and labor could also be reduced when fewer physical links were required - due to ESCON&#x27;s switching features. ESCON is being supplanted by the substantially faster FICON, which runs over Fibre Channel.

ESCON allows the establishment and reconfiguration of channel connections dynamically, without having to take equipment off-line and manually move the cables. ESCON supports channel connections using serial transmission over a pair of fibers. The ESCON Director supports dynamic switching (which could be achieved prior to ESCON, but not with IBM-only products). It also allows the distance between units to be extended up to 60 km over a dedicated fiber. &quot;Permanent virtual circuits&quot; are supported through the switch.

ESCON switching has advantages over a collection of point-to-point links. A peripheral previously capable of accessing a single mainframe can now be connected simultaneously to up to eight mainframes, providing peripheral sharing.

The ESCON interface specifications were adopted in 1996 by ANSI X3T1 committee as the SBCON standard, which is now managed by X3T11.

<text>The Iranian religions, also known as the Persian religions, are, in the context of comparative religion, a grouping of religious movements that originated in the Iranian plateau, which accounts for the bulk of what is called &quot;Greater Iran&quot;. 

==Background==
The beliefs, activities, and cultural events of the ancient Iranians in ancient Iran are complex matters. The ancient Iranians made references to a combination of several Aryans and non-Aryan tribes. The documented history of Iranian religions begins with Zoroastrianism. The ancient Iranian prophet, Zoroaster, reformed the early beliefs of ancient Iranians, the reconstructed Ancient Iranian religion, into a form of henotheism/monotheism. The Gathas, hymns of Zoroaster&#x27;s Avesta, introduced monotheistic ideas to Persia, while through the Yashts and Yasna, mentions are made to polytheism and earlier creeds. The Vedas and the Avesta have both served researchers as important resources in discovering early Proto-Indo-Iranian religion beliefs and ideas, the various beliefs and practices from which the later indigenous religion of the Iranian and Indo-Aryan peoples evolved.

==Antiquity==
* Ancient Iranian religion: The ancient religion of the Iranian peoples
** Scythian religion: The religion of the Scythians and precursor to modern Assianism. Some researchers further speculate that Daevas may partly be based on Scythian gods, hence further influences across Iranian religions as a whole.
* Zoroastrianism: The present-day umbrella term for the indigenous native beliefs and practices of the Iranian peoples. While present-day Zoroastrianism is monolithic, a continuation of the elite form of the Sasanian Empire, in antiquity it had several variants or denominations, differing slightly by location, ethnic affiliation and historical period. It once had large population and high diversity.
** Zurvanism: By the late Achaemenid Empire, Zoroastrianism was also evident as Zurvanism (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), a monist dualism that had a following as late as the Sasanian Empire.
** Mazdakism: A late-5th or early-6th century proto-socialist gnosticism that sought to do away with private property.
* Mithraism: A mystery religion centred around the proto-Zoroastrian Persian god Mithras that was widely practised in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to the 4th century CE
* Manichaeism: A 3rd century dualist religion that may have been influenced by Mandaeism. Manichaeans believe in a &quot;Father of Greatness&quot; (Aramaic: &quot;Abbā dəRabbūṯā&quot;, Persian: &quot;pīd ī wuzurgīh&quot;) and observe Him to be the highest deity (of light).
* Yazidism: A monotheistic ethnic religion that originated in Kurdistan and has roots in pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion, directly derived from the Indo-Iranian tradition.

==Medieval period==
Some religionists made syncretic teachings of Islam and local beliefs and cults such as Iranian paganism, Zurvanism, Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism.
* The early Islamic period saw the development of Persian mysticism, a traditional interpretation of existence, life and love with Perso-Islamic Sufi monotheism as its practical aspect. This development believed in a direct perception of spiritual truth (God), through mystic practices based on divine love.
* Khurramites, a 9th-century religious and political movement based on the 8th century teachings of Sunpadh, who preached a syncretism of Shia Islam and Zoroastrianism. Under Babak Khorramdin, the movement sought the redistribution of private wealth and the abolition of Islam.
* Behafaridians, an 8th-century cult movement around the prophet Behafarid. Although the movement is considered to have its roots in Zoroastrianism, Behafarid and his followers were executed on charges (made by Zoroastrians) of harm to both Zoroastrianism and Islam.
* Yarsanism, a religion which is believed to have been founded in the late 14th century. The basis of faith is belief in one God, who manifests in 1 primary form and 6 secondary ones, and together they are the Holy Seven.
* Druze faith: an esoteric, monotheistic ethnic religion whose tenets include reincarnation and the eternity of the soul. It was founded by the Persian Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad, an Ismaili mystic from Khorasan, and another important early preacher and &#x27;prophet&#x27; of the religion was the Persian ad-Darazi, after whom the religion has taken its name.

==Modern==
* Assianism/Uatsdin, revival of Ossetian ethnic religion (see: Ossetian mythology)
* Roshanniya Movement, a set of monotheistic teachings of Pir Roshan which his people followed.
* Bábism, a mid-19th century monotheistic religion founded by the Báb that was a predecessor of the Baháʼí Faith. 
* Baháʼí Faith, an emerging monotheistic religion founded by Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, a 19th-century Persian exile.

<text>The New Zealand national rugby league team () has represented New Zealand in rugby league since 1907. Administered by the New Zealand Rugby League, they are commonly known as the Kiwis, after the native bird of that name. The team&#x27;s colours are black and white, with the dominant colour being black, and the players perform a haka before every match they play as a challenge to their opponents. The New Zealand Kiwis are currently second in the IRL World Rankings. Since the 1980s, most New Zealand representatives have been based overseas, in the professional National Rugby League and Super League competitions. Before that, players were selected entirely from clubs in domestic New Zealand leagues.

A New Zealand side first played in a 1907 professional rugby tour which pre-dated the birth of rugby league football in the Southern Hemisphere, making it the second oldest national side after England. Since then the Kiwis have regularly competed in international competition, touring Europe and Australia throughout the 20th century. New Zealand have competed in every Rugby League World Cup since the first in 1954, reaching three consecutive tournament finals between 2000 and 2013. In 2008, New Zealand won the World Cup for the first time. They also contest the Baskerville Shield against England.

==History==

Rugby football was introduced into New Zealand by Charles John Monro, son of the then speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives, Sir David Monro. He had been sent to Christ&#x27;s College, East Finchley in north London, where he became an enthusiastic convert to the new code. He brought the game back to his native Nelson, and arranged the first rugby match between Nelson College and Nelson Football Club, played on 14 May 1870.

When New Zealand&#x27;s national rugby team (the All Blacks) toured Britain in 1905 they witnessed the growing popularity of the breakaway non-amateur Northern Union&#x27;s games. On his return in 1906, All Black George William Smith met the Australian entrepreneur J J Giltinan to discuss the potential of professional rugby in Australasia. The first New Zealand team to play professional rugby was known as the All Blacks. To avoid confusion, the terms professional All Blacks or All Golds are used.

===The professional All Blacks===

In the meantime, a lesser known New Zealand rugby player, Albert Henry Baskerville (or Baskiville) was ready to recruit a group of players for a Great Britain pro tour. It is believed that Baskerville became aware of the profits to be made from such a venture while he was working at the Wellington Post Office in 1906. A colleague had a coughing fit and dropped a British newspaper. Baskerville picked it up and noticed a report about a Northern Union (NU) match that over 40,000 people had attended.

Baskerville wrote to the NRFU asking if they would host a New Zealand touring party. The 1905 All Blacks tour was still fresh in English minds, thus the NU saw the upcoming competitive New Zealand tour as exceptional opportunity to raise the profile and finances of the NU game. The NU agreed to the tour provided that some of those original All Blacks were included in the New Zealand team. George Smith arrived back in New Zealand and after learning of Baskerville&#x27;s plans, the two teamed up and began signing players.

The New Zealand Rugby Union became aware of the tour and promptly applied pressure to any All Black or New Zealand representative player it suspected of involvement. They had the New Zealand Government&#x27;s Agent General in London deliver a statement to the British press in an effort to undermine the tour&#x27;s credibility. This had little effect and by that time the professional All Blacks were already sailing across the Tasman to give Australia its first taste of professional rugby.

===The All Golds===

It was during this time that references to the professional All Blacks as the All Golds first appeared.

Clearly, &quot;All Golds&quot; was a play on the amateur &quot;All Blacks&quot; name but it was also an insult to the players, criticising the arrangement where they would each share in the wealth of the tour. The name &quot;All Golds&quot; is now thought to have originated in a New Zealand newspaper in May/June 1907 (see panel below), amidst editorial arguments over whether it was honourable for the proposed &quot;professional All Blacks&quot; team to be paid.

The first documented use in Australia was in a headline in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; (7 August), just before Baskerville&#x27;s team arrived. Those same &quot;Herald&quot; articles also had a tag for those who supported the amateur rugby union calling them the &quot;Lily Whites&quot; (who were clean, pure, and repelled the evils of professionalism).

===The first tour===

Professional rugby in the southern hemisphere kicked off with the professional All Blacks playing a professional rebel New South Wales team organised by Smith&#x27;s contact, James Giltinan. The games drew little interest to start with, but were a major success for the rugby rebels of Australia, as they finally had the money to start the first professional Rugby Football League and hence change the face of rugby in Australia.

New Zealand made it to Great Britain in 1907. They included Australian Dally Messenger in their party. He missed the first Test defeat, but played in the two Tests which the All Golds won. At this time professional rugby, under the banner of the Northern Union, was not played by the RFU rules which was all the All Golds knew. The All Golds took on a week of intensive training after which they started the tour. From a New Zealander&#x27;s point of view, the tour may not have been successful, but to the All Gold&#x27;s credit they performed well considering they only had a week to learn the rules. However, from the NU&#x27;s point of view the tour would have been a godsend, because professional rugby was left in a better state than when they arrived. The tour&#x27;s results were seen the following year when the NRFU clubs more than doubled their membership numbers. The tour had obviously excited the public, raised the profile of their game as well as the game&#x27;s finances.

During their return voyage from England, the All Golds made a stop-over in Australia where they discovered that professional rugby was being played with Northern Union rules, under the banner of the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL). The All Golds played another 10 games in Australia, boosting the finances of the fledgling NSWRFL premiership; making the All Golds tour one of the most significant contributions to the sport of rugby league in Australia.

The All Golds were Hercules Richard &quot;Bumper&quot; Wright (captain), George William Smith (vice-captain), Albert Baskirville (secretary), Herbert Turtill, Harold Rowe, Duncan McGregor, Dally Messenger, Edgar Wrigley, Joseph Lavery, Richard Wynyard, William Wynyard, Lance Todd, Edward Tyne, William Tyler, Arthur Kelly, Tom &quot;Angry&quot; Cross, William Massa Johnston, Eric Watkins, Conrad Byrne, Adam Lile, Daniel Gilchrist, Arthur Callam, Charles Pearce, William Trevarthen, Charles Dunning, William Mackrell, Daniel Fraser (assistant manager), Jim Gleeson (treasurer), and H.J. Palmer (financial manager).

===The Kiwis===

The 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand saw the Kiwis&#x27; first ever test on home soil, with the British side proving too strong. In 1911 the New Zealand national team toured Australia.

1920 represented a high point for New Zealand rugby league (and sport in that country) with two matches against the touring British Lions rugby league team drawing 40,000 fans each in Auckland&#x27;s Domain.

The NZRU was able to control a lot of what the New Zealand Rugby League (NZRL) was able to get its hands on. In 1926, the Union took legal action, trying to stop the League from using the name, the &quot;All Blacks&quot; as their touring name. The NZRL felt that they had equal ownership to the name and were not ready to relinquish it. However, by this time the press had already nicknamed the team &#x27;the Kiwis&#x27;, because of the badge included on their jerseys. Despite the League trying to discourage its usage, the name has stuck ever since.

The 1926–27 New Zealand tour of Britain involved several skirmishes within the Kiwi party. Problems began on the boat journey over, with disputes developing about aspects of the trip and a rift developed between tour manager and coach, Mr Mair, an Australian and seven forwards. The disputes continued once the party arrived in Britain, with one of the rebels being involved in a street fight with another member of the tour party after the opening match. In mid-November, following further disturbances, which almost led to the tour party being evicted from their Harrogate hotel, it was decided that coach Mair would withdraw from team selection and match tactics for a period of four weeks. The tour, and the costly disputes, continued, with the rebels eventually setting sail for home a week earlier than their colleagues. Three months later all seven players were banned for life by the New Zealand authorities. New Zealand did not visit Europe again until 1939.

In 1938, for a tour of Australia, the New Zealand Rugby League officially adopted the name the &quot;New Zealand Kiwis&quot;. This side was also the first to wear a white &quot;V&quot; on their jerseys.

===Post-war===
In 1947 at Odsal Stadium, Bradford in England, a crowd of 42,680 saw New Zealand play, setting a new record for the team on British soil.

The Kiwis were unbeaten in any test series from 1948 to 1951 and won six of their nine tests. They toured England and France in 1951–52. New Zealand were hosted by France for the first ever World Cup match in 1954&#x27;s inaugural tournament. They lost that match as well as the remaining two to finish last. In the 1957 World Cup New Zealand got their first World Cup win, with victory against France in one of their three matches. The Kiwis got exactly the same result in the 1960 World Cup too.

During the 1961–63 era, New Zealand won seven out of ten test matches, including a 2–0 series win over Great Britain, then considered the top rugby league nation in the world. The most outstanding performance by the New Zealanders was their record-breaking 19–0 win over Britain in 1962. It was only the second time a British team had been held scoreless. New Zealand in the period 1960–65 won the Courtney Goodwill Trophy for most successful test-playing nation,

The Kiwis again got a sole win against France from their three matches of the 1970 World Cup.

In 1971, the Kiwis embarked on a 34 match tour of England and France. While they only won half of the matches they played against English club teams, they won the test series 2–1 (winning the first test 18–13, the second 17–14 but losing the third 3–12). They won the series against France 2–0 (winning the first test 27–11, the second 24–2 but drawing the third 3–3).

In the 1972 World Cup New Zealand failed to win a game. In the season-long 1975 World Series, New Zealand won 2 out of their 8 games, finishing second last. The 1977 World Cup brought the Kiwis the familiar result of a sole win against France. A World Cup rated Test took place on Sunday 7 July 1985 at Carlaw Park. Australia&#x27;s 18–0 defeat was the first time they had failed to score in a Test against New Zealand.

On Tuesday 7 July 1987, New Zealand team warmed up for internationals against Papua New Guinea and Australia by taking on the Queensland state team at Lang Park, Brisbane. They then went on to record a 22–16 victory.

Australia crashed to a defeat on Tuesday 21 July 1987, when the Kangaroo dominance of the international game suffered a rare setback. New Zealand were their opponents in a match which had been arranged to fill the gap created by the non-appearance of France. New Zealand won the game 13–6. The next four internationals between Australia and New Zealand were all staged in New Zealand, and all were won by the Kangaroos. In the final Test match of the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour, New Zealand just pipped the British 12–10 in a freezing encounter in Christchurch for a place in the final against Australia. Played at Eden Park in Auckland, it was the most hyped game in the history of rugby league in New Zealand, and the crowd of 47,363 was the biggest ever for a game in Auckland. The final proved to be a huge anti-climax and they were outplayed by the Aussies.

On 20 June 1993 the first all-professional, and all-overseas based, Kiwis side took the field against Australia. New Zealand almost got their revenge on Australia in the 1995 World Cup semi-final when, with the scores level at 20–20, a last minute drop-goal attempt by skipper Matthew Ridge brushed the wrong side of the post, allowing the game to go into extra-time. From there, Australia went on to win. Due to the NZRL&#x27;s alignment with Super League, a New Zealand team selected only from Australasian-based players competed in 1997&#x27;s Super League Tri-series against Queensland and New South Wales.

In 1998 the Kiwis travelled to the UK for a three-test series against Great Britain, winning the first and second tests and drawing the third.

===New Millennium===
The Kiwis handed England their biggest ever loss to again make the final in the 2000 World Cup, but again went down to the Kangaroos 40–12. Gary Freeman coached New Zealand from 2001 to 2002. Beginning in 2002, a &#x27;New Zealand A&#x27; team was selected from players in the domestic New Zealand competition. New Zealand A toured France and the United States in 2002, and the United Kingdom in 2003. In 2004 they hosted New South Wales Country.

In 2003 the Kiwis played their 100th international against Australia.
Brian McClennan was appointed national coach of New Zealand in June 2005. His appointment
was controversial, mainly because he had no professional coaching experience.

2005 would be considered one of the Kiwis greatest years, as they captured the 2005 Tri-Nations title, effectively becoming &quot;de facto&quot; World champions as the three best countries competed in that competition. In the course of winning the Tri-Nations the Kiwis defeated Australia in Sydney for the first time in half a century. In London, the Kiwis posted their highest score ever against Great Britain and, in winning the final, posted the first shut out of Australia in 20 years. The 24–0 result at Elland Road, Leeds equalled the Kiwis&#x27; biggest ever win against Australia – a 49–25 win in Brisbane almost 50 years previously. It was Australia&#x27;s first defeat in a series or tournament since 1978. In New Zealand, Brian McClennan earned praise from the press and signed an extension to his coaching tenure with the Kiwis. In 2006 the Kiwis lost both mid-season tests to the Kangaroos and Lions. The 2006 Tri-nations brought controversy when New Zealand fielded an ineligible player, Nathan Fien, against Great Britain and were later stripped of the two points earned from their 18–14 win.

In July 2007, the Leeds Rhinos announced that Brian McClennan would be joining the club as Head Coach on a two-year contract from 1 December 2007. McClennan subsequently resigned as national coach and his position was taken up by Gary Kemble in August 2007.

===All-Golds revival===

Under Gary Kemble the Kiwis went on to lose the first of their three test series against Great Britain going down 14–20 against the Lions at Huddersfield on 27 October 2007. Following the loss an Australian newspaper reported that former Kiwi captain Hugh McGahan was concerned at Kemble&#x27;s poor start and suggested that former Australian and current Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett should be pursued for the role. McGahan later claimed that his comments had been grossly misreported by the journalist.

In the second test of the series on 3 November 2007, Kemble returned to KC Stadium, the ground on which he had spent a large portion of his playing days with Hull F.C. It was to be a disastrous homecoming, however, as the Kiwis suffered their second humiliating defeat under Kemble when beaten 44–0 by an inspired Great Britain. The win gave Great Britain an unassailable series lead leaving the Kiwis with only pride to play for in the final test at JJB Stadium in Wigan.

Intense criticism followed the second test loss, some of it directed at the players, some of it toward the management of the NZRL. However, Kemble also copped severe criticism from some quarters with one commentator suggesting that Kemble &quot;must be sacked at the series-end&quot; and describing him as a &quot;captain of calamity&quot;. Following the loss, Kiwi&#x27;s captain Roy Asotasi hinted at the possibility of internal issues for the players in adjusting to Kemble&#x27;s coaching style when he compared Kemble&#x27;s approach with that of his predecessor McClennan describing them as &quot;very different&quot; and reporting that the group was &quot;still trying to gel&quot;. Following the loss Kemble acknowledged that he was contemplating resigning from his post if the Kiwis were whitewashed 3–0 by Great Britain.

Despite a far more spirited performance in the third test the Kiwis were unable to prevent the whitewash losing 22–28 after leading 12–0 early in the match. Kemble was forthright in expressing his desire to remain Kiwi coach following the loss with the general feeling being that the loss was &quot;close enough&quot; for him to retain the position. Kemble was the subject of some ridicule for post-match comments which suggested that the Kiwis &quot;almost won the test series&quot; despite an aggregate score of 92–36 across the three tests.

In December 2007 the NZRL held its annual awards dinner. Being one hundred years since the inception of rugby league in New Zealand, a 13-man New Zealand team of the century was named on the evening, with Cliff Johnson named at captain. Mark Graham was named in the second-row and was also honoured as the greatest Kiwi player of the century.

Kemble resigned as head coach after captain Roy Asotasi and David Kidwell both publicly said that they had no confidence in his coaching abilities. Subsequently, former Kiwi, Stephen Kearney was appointed coach with Wayne Bennett given a role as an advisor.

The All Golds were revived again in 2008 as a testimonial match for Ruben Wiki, where they defeated the New Zealand Maori team 44–10 at Yarrow Stadium in New Plymouth.

===Kearney&#x27;s Kiwis===

Stephen Kearney&#x27;s first match as New Zealand coach was against Australia in the 2008 Centenary Test. The match celebrated 100 years since the first Trans-Tasman clash began. 
Later on in that year, the 2008 World Cup kicked off. Wayne Bennett assisted Kearney in the competition. Kearney&#x27;s Kiwis advanced from the group stage in second position which saw them face England for a second time in the tournament, this time in the semi-final. In the group stage, the Kiwis were at one point trailing 24–8 before scoring 26 consecutive points and keep the Poms scoreless in the second half to go on to win 36–24. The Kiwis didn&#x27;t have to recover a deficit in the semi-final as they went on to another World Cup final meeting with Australia. In a see-saw like battle, the Kiwis created history after full-time when they won the final 34–20. This was New Zealand&#x27;s first ever World Cup title, as well as the Australian team&#x27;s first loss since Great Britain defeated them in November 2006 and their first loss to New Zealand since November 2005. It was also their first loss in a World Cup match since 1995 and in a final since 1972.

At the end of the 2010 domestic season, New Zealand played in the 2010 Four Nations. During the Round-robin fixtures, New Zealand produced their biggest win on home soil with a 64-point win over Papua New Guinea. The Kiwis qualified for the final where they played Australia at the same venue as the 2008 World Cup final. The Kiwis won at Lang Park once again after a try in the final seconds of the game sealed the low scoring game, and 2010 Four Nations title, for the Kiwis, winning 16–12.

In 2013 New Zealand headed into the World Cup as defending champions for the first time. The Kiwis advanced out of their group with ease despite suffering a scare against Samoa in their opening game. Kearney&#x27;s men then advanced to the semi-finals, courtesy of a win over Scotland, where they then met hosts England at Wembley. It was a see-saw affair which saw the Kiwis trailing 18–14 with one minute on the clock remaining until star play-maker Shaun Johnson produced a magical moment to level the scores and then convert his try after the siren to win the match and make the Kiwis advance to a third consecutive World Cup final. The win also made the Kiwis equal their best winning streak record of five games. In the final, watched by a record international attendance of 74,468, they were outclassed at &#x27;The Theatre of Dreams&#x27; as Australia earned revenge for their 2008 final defeat. After the World Cup Kearney was put under pressure after it was found out players were mixing sleeping pills and energy drinks during the tournament which affected performances. He had to reapply for his job and was only given a two-year contract, unlike the usual one that would end after the next World Cup, which the NZRL said was because he needed to &quot;re-establish the culture at the Kiwis which was damaged so badly at the World Cup&quot;. Kearney immediately took action, naming six debutantes for the first test-match of 2014.

At the end of the 2014 club season New Zealand played in the 2014 Four Nations. In the first game they continued their good record against Australia at the &#x27;Cauldron&#x27; with another win setting the record at 3 wins in the past 4 meetings against the Kangaroos at the venue. In the second game the Kiwis faced another scare against Samoa when they were on the verge of a 12–10 defeat with just minutes remaining before Kearney&#x27;s men scored near full-time to avoid the shock result. After defeating England in their final game they qualified for the final held in Wellington where they&#x27;d face Australia again. New Zealand won the match 22–18 and therefore the Four Nations, their second tournament title. This was their first win over Australia on home soil since 2003 where they beat the Aussies at North Harbour Stadium. In the final, winger Manu Vatuvei scored two tries to become New Zealand&#x27;s top try-scorer after tallying his 20th try during the match to beat a record that&#x27;s been held by Nigel Vagana since 2006. This was the first time New Zealand went through an entire tournament unbeaten.

In March 2015, Kearney&#x27;s successful management saw the NZRL announce an extension to his contract until the end of the 2017 World Cup. The 2015 Anzac Test was held in Suncorp Stadium. The Kiwis continued their great record in Brisbane with a commanding 26–12 victory giving them their first Anzac test win since 1998. It was also the first time since 1953 that New Zealand beat Australia in three consecutive test matches. This win also meant New Zealand equaled their best winning streak record once again just like they did after the 2013 World Cup semi-final. On 15 May 2015, the new RLIF World Rankings were announced and it read that, for just the second time, New Zealand were officially the best team in the World. New Zealand were last ranked World number one back in 2008 after their World Cup success. At the end of the year New Zealand were unable to beat their winning record after losing the Baskerville Series to England. At the conclusion of that series, it was revealed that Kearney had the best record out of any New Zealand coach to date as he was involved in the most matches (41), won the most matches (23), and won the most matches against Australia (5). He also revealed that despite the defeat to England he wanted the Kiwis to &#x27;dominate the next decade of international rugby league&#x27;.

Before the 2016 Anzac Test, controversy had occurred when regular New Zealand players Manu Vatuvei and Ben Matulino were caught partying and mixing energy drinks with prescription drugs. Kearney toughened his stance and announced he&#x27;d not be selecting them for the test-match in a decision which saw commends from fellow New Zealand internationals. These players were just two of ten regular name players missing from the New Zealand side for the fixture, with others missing through injury or private issues. New Zealand lost the match 16–0 and in the process ended their winning streak against Australia. This was also the first time New Zealand scored zero points in a test match since 2007.

In September 2016, Kearney left New Zealand after accepting an offer to coach New Zealand&#x27;s only NRL team.

===Kidwell&#x27;s Kiwis===
David Kidwell&#x27;s first match as New Zealand coach was against Australia in Perth. This was the first time an international rugby league game was held in Western Australia. In the 2016 Four Nations, New Zealand beat England for the first time on English soil since the tournament was introduced in 2009. In New Zealand&#x27;s last round-robin fixture, they drew with Scotland and, in the process, gave the &#x27;fourth nation&#x27; their first ever point in the tournament&#x27;s history. Despite the shock result, New Zealand still managed to qualify for a rematch with Trans-Tasman rivals, Australia, in the final. After losing by just 6 points in the round-robin stage meeting, the Kiwis were thrashed by the Kangaroos in the final 34–8.

After the final Anzac Test fixture was played, Kidwell spoke on behalf of the NZRL to announce that captain Jesse Bromwich, and Kevin Proctor were suspended from playing in the World Cup after they were caught buying cocaine from a stranger after the test-match.

Controversy occurred before the 2017 World Cup, after star forward, Jason Taumalolo, decided to switch allegiances after choosing to play for Tonga at the World Cup rather than his country of birth. David Fusitu&#x27;a, Sio Siua Taukeiaho and Manu Ma&#x27;u, who were all in contention for World Cup selection, also followed Taumololo&#x27;s lead. Australian forward Andrew Fifita did likewise, after initially being selected in the Australian team, making Tonga one of the tournament favourites. It was at first believed, Taumalolo switched to play for Tonga in protest for the NZRL&#x27;s decision to suspend Bromwich and Proctor from playing in the World Cup. However, it was later confirmed he just wanted to play for his family, and grow the game in the Pacific Island nation. Former New Zealand coach, Graham Lowe, and former New Zealand captain, Benji Marshall, hit out at Taumalolo for his decision. New Zealand began the World Cup with convincing victories over both Samoa, and Scotland. In their final pool match, they took on the &#x27;most-talked about team of the tournament&#x27;, Tonga. After leading 16–2 at halftime, New Zealand created unwanted history, becoming the first tier-1 nation to lose to a tier-2 nation in a World Cup match. New Zealand then took on Fiji in the quarter-final. Kidwell&#x27;s side went on to create back-to-back defeats to tier-2 nations and therefore be eliminated in the quarterfinals. This was the lowest ever finish the Kiwis created in a World Cup tournament. After the match, critics and media were hitting out at Kidwell and his players with the way they handled the defeat.
After the Kiwis&#x27; most embarrassing World Cup performance in history, pressure was put on Kidwell to leave.

==Team image==
=== Kit uniform ===

Since the late 1880s, the New Zealand &quot;Kiwis&quot; have worn black shirt, shorts and socks which became their representative colours. Black has identified New Zealand athletic teams since that times, starting with the establishment of the &quot;NZ Amateur Athletic Association&quot; (the main body that regulated sports in the country) in 1887. When the association hosted national athletic events across the country, black was the colour worn by the athletes on those competitions.

Nevertheless, the first rugby national team had toured on New South Wales in 1884 wearing a blue shirt with a gold fern on the chest, although it changed to black shirt with a silver fern four years later, according to the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; newspaper of July 6.

===Kit suppliers and sponsors===
On the back of the shorts, Revera is on the bottom left and the bottom right.

===Haka===

The haka is a very respected tradition to the Kiwis, which is why they turn down offers to do it for sponsorship/promotional purposes. The initiation haka is used as a form of team-bonding for the Kiwis, although this haka has a unique twist. All new players and staff are required to perform an initiation haka, even journalists have been forced into it. This usually happens during an open training session. Staff and players gather into a circle, with new players and staff standing inside the circle. They then strip down to their underwear and start performing a haka. As the haka starts, the team members forming the circle start to lower themselves, revealing the performance to media and fans who have shown up.

Before the matches, the Kiwis traditionally performed the Ka Mate haka, but, since the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, they instead perform the Te Iwi Kiwi haka. The words of the latter are translated as follows: Its pèrformance is preceded by the team forming a huddle with the leader at the centre while the karakia &quot;Tūturu whakamaua kia tīnā! Tīnā! Haumi e, hui e! tāiki e!&quot; is chanted.

The current coach of New Zealand is Stacey Jones.

<doc id="952066" wikidata="Q356151" url="?curid=952066" title="Julius Fučík (composer)">
<text>Julius Ernest Wilhelm Fučík (; 18 July 1872 – 25 September 1916) was an Austro-Hungarian composer of Czech ethnicity and conductor of military bands. He became a prolific composer, with over 400 marches, polkas, and waltzes to his name. As most of his works were for military bands, he is sometimes known as the &quot;Bohemian Sousa&quot;.

Today his marches are still played as patriotic music in the Czech Republic. His worldwide reputation rests primarily on two works: &quot;Florentiner Marsch&quot;, popular throughout much of Europe and the United States, and the &quot;Entrance of the Gladiators&quot; (&quot;Vjezd gladiátorů&quot;), which is widely recognized, often under the title &quot;Thunder and Blazes&quot;, as one of the most popular theme tunes for circus clowns.

==Biography==

Fučík was born in Prague, Bohemia, on 18 July 1872 when Prague was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As a student, he learned to play the bassoon with Ludwig Milde, violin with Antonín Bennewitz, and various percussion instruments, later studying composition under Antonín Dvořák.

In 1891, he joined the 49th Austro-Hungarian Regiment as a military musician. He initially played in Krems by the Danube under Josef Wagner. In 1894, he left the army to take up a position as second bassoonist at the German Theatre in Prague. A year later he became the conductor of the Danica Choir in the Croatian city of Sisak. During this time, Fučík wrote a number of chamber music pieces, mostly for clarinet and bassoon.

In 1897, he rejoined the army as the bandmaster for the 86th Infantry Regiment based in Sarajevo. Shortly after, he wrote his most famous piece, the &quot;Einzug der Gladiatoren&quot; or &quot;Entrance of the Gladiators&quot;. Originally titled &quot;Grande Marche Chromatique&quot; for its use of chromatic scales, his interest in Roman history led him to rename the march as he did. In 1910, Canadian composer Louis-Phillipe Laurendeau arranged &quot;Entrance of the Gladiators&quot; for a small band, under the title &quot;Thunder and Blazes.&quot; It is in this version that the piece is most familiar, universally associated with the appearance of the clowns in a circus performance.

In 1900, Fučík&#x27;s band was moved to Budapest where he found there were eight regimental bands ready to play his compositions, but he also faced more competition to get noticed. Having more musicians at his disposal, Fučík began to experiment with transcriptions of orchestral works. In 1907 while in Budapest he composed another march &quot;The Florentiner March&quot;.

In 1910, Fučík moved again, returning to Bohemia where he became the bandmaster of the 92nd Infantry Regiment in Theresienstadt. At the time, the band was one of the finest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and he toured with them giving concerts in Prague and Berlin to audiences of over 10,000 people.

In 1913, Fučík settled in Berlin where he started his own band, the Prager Tonkünstler-Orchester, and a music publishing company, Tempo Verlag, to market his compositions. His fortunes began to wane with the outbreak of the First World War. Under the privations of the war, his business failed and his health suffered. On 25 September 1916, Julius Fučík died in Berlin at the age of 44. He is buried in Vinohrady Cemetery in Prague.

Fučík was the brother of opera singer and uncle of the journalist Julius Fučík, who shared his name.

==In popular culture==

A 1976 barrel organ recording of Fučik’s classic march &quot;Die Regimentskinder&quot; by the C. John Mears Organisation is prominently featured in popular Atari Interactive video game RollerCoaster Tycoon.

<doc id="952067" wikidata="Q19750498" url="?curid=952067" title="Mazdakism">
<text>Mazdakism (Persian: مزدکیه) was an Iranian religion, which was an offshoot of Zoroastrianism.

The religion was founded in the early Sasanian Empire by Zaradust-e Khuragen, a Zoroastrian mobad who was a contemporary of Mani (d. 274). However, it is named after its most prominent advocate, Mazdak, who was a powerful and controversial figure during the reign of Emperor Kavad I ().

== Theology ==
Mazdakism was a dualistic religion that appeared to be influenced by Manichaeism. It taught that there were two principles, light and dark (good and evil) that merged at a primordial time creating the universe. The Mazdakites worshipped the God of Light.

== Ethics ==
Mazdakism strongly promoted simple and pacifist living. Acts such as murder and killing animals for food or sport were forbidden, as was eating meat. Followers were to treat all people, even their enemies kindly. The movement also believed in the holding of all things in common to reduce greed.

<doc id="952068" wikidata="Q1372219" url="?curid=952068" title="Euclides (crater)">
<text>Euclides is a small lunar impact crater located near the eastern edge of Oceanus Procellarum, about 30 kilometers to the west of the Montes Riphaeus mountains. The mare in the vicinity is devoid of significant craters, but to the west is an area of low rises. The crater is named after the Greek mathematician Euclid.

Euclides is a bowl-shaped formation with a circular rim. It is surrounded by streaks of ejecta that have a higher albedo than the nearby maria. This nebulous skirt of light-hued material makes this feature very prominent under a high Sun, and it is one of the brightest sites on the Moon.

== Euclides D ==

Euclides D is a small lunar impact crater in the Mare Cognitum. It has a diameter of 6 kilometers and a depth of 1.3 kilometers. It lies to the southeast of Euclides, beyond the Montes Riphaeus mountains.

In 1976, Euclides D was renamed &quot;Eppinger&quot; by the IAU to honor Hans Eppinger, a professor of pathological anatomy at Graz. However, in 2002, after Eppinger&#x27;s association with Nazi prison camps had been brought to the attention of the IAU&#x27;s &quot;Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature&quot;, the name was reverted to Euclides D.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Euclides.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Euclides B — &quot;See&quot; Norman.

<text>Rose Park is a neighborhood located in the northwest area of Salt Lake City, Utah, and is among the most ethnically diverse areas in Utah. Its name comes from the area&#x27;s original developer, who arranged part of the area&#x27;s streets in the shape of several roses, with one of its main streets, American Beauty Drive, acting as a long rose stem. This area&#x27;s original roof shingles were red or green and its street names all feature rose varieties. Rose Park residents enjoy a very short commute (less than 5 minutes) to downtown, high bikeability, and many recreational amenities.

==History==
In the 1940s and 50s, Rose Park was marketed as a reasonably-priced subdivision with larger plots than older Salt Lake City neighborhoods, such as The Avenues. Developer Alan E. Brockbank intended to create affordable brick homes for GI&#x27;s returning from World War II. The declaration of subdivision for Rose Park, typical of American residential developments of the period, included a racial covenant, stating: &quot;No person of any race or nationality other than the White or Caucasian Race, shall use or occupy any building plot or lot or any portion thereof, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestics of a different race employed by the owner or tenant.&quot;After World War II, population and growth in the area increased as vacant plots were bought up and homes built. Like the early residents of Murray, many were non-Mormon, blue-collar workers, although Rose Park&#x27;s residents often worked for major railroad companies, such as Union Pacific, Southern Pacific, and the Los Angeles-Salt Lake Railroad companies, rather than smelters, common in Murray. More recently, one can find accountants, electricians, business managers, engineers, real estate agents and brokers, architects, and police officers among Rose Park residents.

Many homes are being renovated by young families who have moved into the area. The homes are small by today&#x27;s standards (averaging 1,600 to 1,800 square feet) and are generally constructed of brick though some early stick framed homes are present in the area. Trees (including many varieties of fruit trees) were planted in the neighborhood by young, World War II-era families. Rose Park now includes some of the city&#x27;s largest and most densely spaced trees.

On September 8, 2020, a windstorm with category three hurricane-force winds swept through the area. The winds toppled many of Rose Park&#x27;s oldest and largest trees, causing property damage and widespread power outages.

===Super Fund site===
In the early 1980s a hazardous site existed near Rose Park near Rosewood Park and east of the Rose Park Golf Course. The state of Utah petitioned the United States Environmental Protection Agency to add it to their list of Superfund cleanup sites. The agency agreed and in 1982 it was added to the Superfund list as &quot;Rose Park Sludge Pit.&quot;

Local refineries dumped waste products in the sludge pit from 1930 until 1957. The acidic sludge contained carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and sulfur dioxide posing a threat to groundwater and surrounding organisms. This was particularly unnerving because much of the municipal water in Rose Park comes from scattered wells. Though no contaminants were ever detected, the threat of contamination was enough cause for action.

Amoco oil company was potentially liable for the site and agreed to clean it up in 1985. The solution entailed the construction of a slurry wall around and under the sludge pit to avoid groundwater contamination. A clay cap was also placed on top of the sludge pit and topped with grass.

Since these improvements, the contamination site has passed all of its five-year reviews with the solution deemed &quot;protective of human health and the environment.&quot; No additional threats have been identified.

==Boundaries==

Rose Park is defined as west of I-15, north of 600 North, and east of Redwood Road. The neighborhood&#x27;s boundaries extend north to the city limits and the shared county line of Salt Lake and Davis Counties. Four original stone markers define Rose Park&#x27;s major streets, as the original boundaries of the historic Rose Park development were between 900 West to the East, the Jordan River to the West and between 600 North and 1000 North. The area is also identifiable by its generally Post-war or Mid-century modern style architecture.

Rose Park lies north of the Fairpark and Glendale neighborhoods and west of the northwest slope of Capitol Hill. The neighborhood is often thought of as encompassing the entire urban area north and west of interstates 15 and 80, though its actual boundaries are relatively small.

The entire neighborhood falls within the boundary of West High School, the state&#x27;s oldest and among its largest high schools.

==Education==
The Rose Park neighborhood lies within the Salt Lake City School District and contains four elementary schools: Rose Park Elementary, Escalante Elementary, Backman Elementary, and Newman Elementary. The Salt Lake Center for Science Education, a charter school within the Salt Lake City School District, occupies the building and grounds of the former Northwest Middle School which moved to a new, larger location outside of the neighborhood in 2006.

The Guadelupe School is also based in Rose Park, which is a nonprofit charter organization consisting of five main academic programs for various age groups.

==Crime==
For the last several decades, Rose Park has suffered from a negative reputation. Rose Park is often confused with Glendale, Poplar Grove, Fairpark, and other west-side communities of Salt Lake City.

Crime reports are published monthly by the Salt Lake City Police Department. These reports show that Rose Park has a rising crime rate for Salt Lake City. Similar to any other community of Salt Lake City, crime is being aggressively targeted by the police department. Rose Park is claimed by multiple gangs such as Rose Park Norteños, Rose Park Taliban/Iraqi Mafia Gang (bloods) and Rose Park Family (crips).

==Culture==
Rose Park is a culturally, religiously and ethnically diverse area, with a majority of its population being of Hispanic/Latino descent. The neighborhood is also home to several community-based groups such as The Lions Club, The Rose Park Revival Group, and The Rose Park Community Center and Gardens. Soccer is a popular and unifying sport throughout Rose Park, with residents from all parts of the neighborhood often coming together for matches.

Rose Park also holds a strong leftist political presence, and is home to pro-Chicano civil and human rights group, the Rose Park Brown Berets. The group has advocated for increased police accountability after the controversial shooting of Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal by officers from the Salt Lake Police Department, as well as economic, social, and racial equality. The Rose Park Brown Berets are also vocally opposed to gentrification, an increasingly frequent issue in many west-side Salt Lake City neighborhoods.

In recent years, Rose Park has received a new influx of young, upper-middle class, white residents, primarily drawn to the neighborhood&#x27;s affordability and proximity to downtown Salt Lake City. A similar trend was observed in the nearby Sugarhouse in the late 1990s. This is an ongoing conflict throughout the Rose Park, Glendale, Fairpark, and Guadelupe areas, with longtime residents rallying against new development and the negative effects of gentrification.

==Community==
Rose Park benefits from an active community council. The Rose Park Community Council is composed of an elected body of volunteers who serve the interests of Rose Park and the community. The purpose of this council is to provide community input and information to various city departments. Community councils are encouraged to make recommendations to the city on all matters affecting the city or each organization&#x27;s particular community or neighborhood. The council holds a monthly meeting, to which the public is encouraged to attend, the first Wednesday of each month, at 6:30pm, in the Day Riverside Library (located at 1575 W. 1000 North).

Rose Park is a moderately walkable neighborhood with shortcuts allowing easy access to the parks, churches and other amenities in the area. Rose Park includes:
* A public golf course
* Two parks including part of the Jordan River Parkway, tennis courts, soccer and baseball fields, pavilions, and several playgrounds. One of which hosts an annual Turkey Bowl: 
* A public library and eco-garden
* Several small, family-owned restaurants and stores.
* Easy access to I-15, I-215, and the Legacy Parkway.

Rose Park holds an annual community festival each spring. Information about this festival can be found at www.roseparkfestival.org. Rose Park also made City Weekly&#x27;s best of 2010 in a favorable review detailing the walkable neighborhood, nearby golf course, locally owned ethnic food, and quality of life enjoyed by residents.

<text>Sevdalinka (), also known as Sevdah music, is a traditional genre of folk music originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sevdalinka is an integral part of the Bosniak culture, but is also spread across the ex-Yugoslav region, including Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. The actual composers of many Sevdalinka songs are unknown because these are traditional folk songs. In 2024, sevdalinka was included on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 

Sevdalinka songs are characterised by their slow or moderate tempo, elaborate structure, and intense, emotionally potent melodies. The singer will often impose a rhythm and tempo into the song, both of which can vary throughout the piece. Traditionally, Sevdalinkas are considered &quot;women&#x27;s songs&quot;, often addressing issues of longing and love, often unfulfilled and unrequited, some exploring women&#x27;s physical desires for their loved ones, and some even having a range of comedic elements. However, there are Sevdah songs written and sung by men as well. Traditionally, they were performed without any instruments, hence their elaborate melodies. As with most old folk styles, what the sounds of the original melodies would have been like rests on conjecture, as their interpretations are now closely aligned, in part due to the historically increasing role of accompanying instruments, with the Western chromatic system (which stands in contrast to Oriental modes, which often use intervals smaller than a semitone). Modern interpretations of Sevdalinka songs are usually accompanied by a small orchestra featuring the accordion (as the most prominent instrument), the violin, the nylon-string guitar and/or other string instruments, such as the upright bass, the saz or šargija and occasionally the flute or clarinet, and the snare drum. In modern interpretations, an accordion or violin solo can almost always be heard between the verses.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Sevdalinka&quot; comes from the Turkish &quot;sevda&quot; which, in turn, derives from the Ottoman Turkish &quot;sevda&quot; and refers to the state of being in love, and more specifically to the intense and forlorn longing associated with love-sickness and unfulfilled and unrequited love. This is related also to the Persian word (), meaning both &quot;melancholic&quot; and &quot;enamoured&quot;. It was these associations that arrived with the word when it was brought to Bosnia through the activities of the Ottoman Empire. Today, it is a richly evocative Bosnian word, denoting &quot;to pine&quot; or &quot;to long&quot;, whether for a loved one, a place or a time, with a sense of joy and pain, both being at the emotional core of Sevdalinka lyrics.

The people of Bosnia employ the words &quot;sevdalinka&quot; and &quot;sevdah&quot; interchangeably as a name for this sort of music, although the shared Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian loanword &quot;&quot; can also be used in other contexts. Saudade, a central term in Portuguese Fado, is of the same origin, emerging from Arabic medical discourses and used for centuries in both Al-Andalus and the Ottoman empire. In turn, the term &quot;melancholy&quot; or &quot;melancholia&quot; is of similar medical origin, arising from the ancient Greek term for black bile&quot; or &quot;melan kholé&quot;.

==Origins and history==
The origins of Sevdalinka are not known for certain, although it is known to date at least as far back as to the arrival of the Ottomans in the medieval Balkans. Their melodies and the venerable lyrical figure of &quot;Aman, aman&quot; hint at a Sephardic and Andalusian influence, which can be explained by the arrivals of Sephardic refugees into Ottoman Bosnia, or more likely attributed to an Ottoman Turkish signification which translates into &quot;have mercy&quot;.

The first historic appearance of Sevdalinka is considered to be &quot;Bolest Muje Carevića&quot; (&quot;The Illness of Mujo Carević&quot;), which is believed to have been written around the year 1475. Another early written document that refers to the Sevdalinka is the work of an Italian man passing through the Bosnian city of Visoko in the year 1574, who has heard what he described as &quot;sad songs sung by the locals&quot; that made him feel melancholic. In the early 16th century, a duke from Split also mentioned what was probably a Sevdalinka song about the forbidden love of a Christian girl named Mara Vornić and a Muslim boy named Fadil or Adel/Adil (accounts vary).

The earliest known female Sevdalinka poet was Umihana Čuvidina, who wrote mainly about her deceased husband.

==Performers==
A couple of significant singers of the Sevdalinka in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were Rešad Bešlagić and Vuka Šeherović. Towards the end of World War II, Radio Sarajevo was founded and signed some of the most prominent &quot;Sevdalije&quot; (or Sevdalinka performers), among them Zaim Imamović in 1945, Himzo Polovina in 1953, Beba Selimović in 1954, Safet Isović in 1955, and Zehra Deović in 1960. Nada Mamula was signed to Radio Beograd in 1946. Others, such as Silvana Armenulić, Emina Zečaj, Nedžad Salković, Hanka Paldum and Meho Puzić, were signed to record for such production companies as Jugoton, Diskoton or other Yugoslav labels.

Although sung predominantly by traditional Bosniak singers, the Sevdalinka made its way to many &quot;mainstream&quot; musicians. Sevdalinkas have as such been covered by Josipa Lisac, Željko Bebek, Ibrica Jusić, Jadranka Stojaković, Toše Proeski and Zdravko Čolić, among others.

In the 1990s, the band Mostar Sevdah Reunion was assembled in Mostar, and in the early 2000s rose to prominence on the &quot;world music&quot; scene, receiving prominent awards for their lively interpretations of Sevdalinkas (which fused Sevdalinka with contemporary musical styles such as jazz, funk and rock) and introducing many people outside of Bosnia to the genre of the Sevdalinka. Equally popular today are songwriters/performers Damir Imamović, Božo Vrećo and Amira Medunjanin, the latter dubbed by the music journalist and author Garth Wainwright as &quot;Bosnia&#x27;s Billie Holiday&quot;.
