<text>Freiherr Hans Guido von Bülow (; 8 January 1830 – 12 February 1894) was a German conductor, pianist, and composer of the Romantic era. As one of the most distinguished conductors of the 19th century, his activity was critical for establishing the successes of several major composers of the time, especially Richard Wagner and Johannes Brahms. Alongside Carl Tausig, Bülow was perhaps the most prominent of the early students of the Hungarian composer, pianist and conductor Franz Liszt; he gave the first public performance of Liszt&#x27;s Sonata in B minor in 1857. He became acquainted with, fell in love with and eventually married Liszt&#x27;s daughter Cosima, who later left him for Wagner. Noted for his interpretation of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, he was one of the earliest European musicians to tour the United States.

==Life and career==

Bülow was born in Dresden into the old and prominent House of Bülow. He was the son of novelist (1803–1853) and his wife, Franziska Elisabeth Stoll von Berneck (1800–1888). From the age of nine, he was a student of Professor Friedrich Wieck (the father of Clara Schumann). However, his parents insisted that he study law instead of music, and they sent him to Leipzig. There he met Franz Liszt, and on hearing some music of Richard Wagner—specifically, the premiere of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in 1850—he decided to ignore the dictates of his parents and make himself a career in music instead. He studied the piano in Leipzig with the famous pedagogue Louis Plaidy. He obtained his first conducting job in Zürich, on Wagner&#x27;s recommendation, in 1850.

Bülow had a strongly acerbic personality and a sharp tongue; this alienated many musicians whom he worked with. He was dismissed from his Zurich job for this reason, but at the same time he was beginning to win renown for his ability to conduct new and complex works without a score. In 1851, he became a student of Liszt, marrying his daughter Cosima in 1857. They had two daughters: Daniela, born in 1860, and Blandina, born in 1863. During the 1850s and early 1860s he was active as a pianist, conductor, and writer, and became well known throughout Germany as well as Russia. In 1857, he premiered Liszt&#x27;s Piano Sonata in B minor in Berlin.

In 1864 he became the Hofkapellmeister in Munich, and it was at this post he achieved his principal renown. He conducted the premieres of two Wagner operas, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, in 1865 and 1868 respectively; both were immensely successful. Meanwhile, however, Cosima had been carrying on an affair with Richard Wagner and gave birth to their daughter Isolde in 1865. Two years later, they had another daughter, Eva. Although Cosima and Wagner&#x27;s affair was now open knowledge, Bülow still refused to grant his wife a divorce. It was only when she gave birth to a third child, Siegfried, that the conductor at last relented. Their divorce was finalized in 1870, after which Cosima and Wagner married. Bülow never spoke to Wagner again, and he did not see his former wife for 11 years afterwards. However, he apparently continued to respect the composer on a professional level, as he still conducted his works and mourned Wagner&#x27;s death in 1883. In July 1882 he married the actress Marie Schanzer.
In 1867 Bülow became director of the newly reopened Königliche Musikschule in Munich. He taught piano there in the manner of Liszt. He remained as director of the Conservatory until 1869. Bülow&#x27;s students in Berlin included Asger Hamerik and Joseph Pache.

In addition to championing the music of Wagner, Bülow was a supporter of the music of Brahms and Tchaikovsky. He was the soloist in the world premiere of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor in Boston in 1875. He was also a devotee of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s music; he came up with epithets for all of Chopin&#x27;s Opus 28 Preludes, but these have generally fallen into disuse. Only the D-flat major Prelude No. 15 is widely known by his title, the &quot;Raindrop&quot;.

He was the first to perform (from memory) the complete cycle of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas, and with Sigmund Lebert, he co-produced an edition of the sonatas.

For the winter season of 1877–1878, he was appointed as conductor of the orchestral subscription concerts presented at the newly opened St Andrew&#x27;s Hall in Glasgow by Glasgow Choral Union, touring with their orchestra to repeat these programmes in other Scottish cities. Among the works he conducted there was the recently revised version of Brahms Symphony No 1.

From 1878 to 1880, he was Hofkapellmeister in Hanover but was forced to leave after fighting with a tenor singing the &quot;Knight of the Swan [&quot;Schwan&quot;]&quot; role in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;; Bülow had called him the &quot;Knight of the Swine [&quot;Schwein&quot;]&quot;. In 1880 he moved to Meiningen where he took the equivalent post, and where he built the Meiningen Court Orchestra into one of the finest in Germany; among his other demands, he insisted that the musicians learn to play all their parts from memory.

It was during his five years in Meiningen that he met Richard Strauss (though the meeting actually took place in Berlin). His first opinion of the young composer was not favorable, but he changed his mind when he was confronted with a sample of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Serenade&quot;. Later on, he used his influence to give Strauss his first regular employment as a conductor. Like Strauss, Bülow was attracted to the ideas of Max Stirner, whom he reputedly had known personally. In April 1892 Bülow closed his final performance with the Berlin Philharmonic, where he had been serving as Principal Conductor since 1887, with a speech &quot;exalting&quot; the ideas of Stirner. Together with John Henry Mackay, Stirner&#x27;s biographer, he placed a memorial plaque at Stirner&#x27;s last residence in Berlin.

Some of his orchestral innovations included the addition of the five-string double bass and the pedal timpani; the pedal timpani have since become standard instruments in the symphony orchestra. His accurate, sensitive, and profoundly musical interpretations established him as the prototype of the virtuoso conductors who flourished at a later date. He was also an astute and witty musical journalist.

In the late 1880s he settled in Hamburg, but continued to tour, both conducting and performing on the piano.

Bülow suffered from chronic neuralgiform headaches, which were caused by a tumor of the cervical radicular nerves. After about 1890 his mental and physical health began to fail, and he sought a warmer, drier climate for recovery; he died in a hotel in Cairo, Egypt, at the age of 64, ten months after his final concert performance.

<text>Horatio Bridge (April 8, 1806 – March 18, 1893) was an officer of the United States Navy who, as Chief of the Bureau of Provisions, served for many years as head of the Navy&#x27;s supply organization. Appointed by his former college mate, President Franklin Pierce, Bridge held this post under various administrations, including the whole period of the Civil War.

He also had the distinction of being the first man in the Navy to employ the idea of comprehensive fleet supply. Under his direction, the systematic supply of Navy vessels on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts during the Civil War was established and carried out with conspicuous success.

==Early life and education==
The son of a judge, Bridge was born at Augusta, Maine. He received his early education in private schools and at Hallowell Academy. Bridge was graduated from Bowdoin College in the class of 1825, which included among its members Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. According to a newspaper item of 1893, it was Horatio Bridge&#x27;s appreciation of Hawthorne&#x27;s early writings, and his faith in this man of genius, that, to use Hawthorne&#x27;s own words, &quot;was responsible for my being an author&quot;. One of his later books, &quot;The Snow-Image, and Other Twice-Told Tales&quot;, was dedicated to his friend and benefactor, Horatio Bridge.

The Commodore himself wielded a graceful pen, and besides contributions to periodicals was the author of &quot;The Journal of an African Cruiser&quot;, which was edited by Hawthorne, and &quot;Personal Recollections of Nathaniel Hawthorne&quot;.

==Legal and naval careers==
After graduation from Bowdoin College, he studied law at Northampton Law School; was admitted to the bar, and practiced his profession at Augusta and Skowhegan (then Milburn), Maine. After ten years of practice, he found law distasteful to him and entered the U.S. Navy as a purser in 1838. After several long cruises in African, European, and Pacific waters, he was called to Washington and appointed Chief of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Provisions and Clothing.

He handled with great skill the responsible duties of this office. Of the skill and ability which he showed in its management, Senator James Grimes testified in a debate in 1865: &quot;No Bureau of this government has been more admirably and accurately managed then the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing.&quot; To this, Senator John P. Hale, added; &quot;I think a great reason, and a very important one, is because there is at the head of that Bureau an honest, vigilant, and faithful man&quot;.

During Bridge&#x27;s tenure as head of the Bureau, he made many significant innovations in the Navy&#x27;s supply system. Some of the more important ones were:

* Advertising for competitive bids became mandatory except for personal services, and except in the case of emergency.
* Preserved meats, pickles, butter, cheese, and desiccated vegetables could be bought without formal advertising and sealed bids.
* A requirement was written into the statutes which specified that &quot;the Chief of the Bureau, also known as the Paymaster General, be appointed from the list of Paymasters of the Navy of not less than ten years standing&quot;. This meant that for the first time it was legally impossible for the Paymaster General to be a civilian.
* In 1862, the agitation against the rum ration became so pronounced that on September 1 of that year, it was finally eliminated and as a compensation, men&#x27;s pay was raised five cents a day. It has been said that the Act was responsible for the origin of the old Navy song: &quot;They raised our pay five cents a day, and took away our grog forever&quot;.

According to a Navy press notice, Bridge resigned his position as Chief of the Bureau in 1869. However, shortly thereafter he accepted the position as the first Chief Inspector of Clothing, which he held until the passage of the law debarring all Navy officers from active duty after reaching the age of sixty-two. He was detached from duty after serving afloat and ashore for fifty-five years.

==Family life==
Commodore Bridge was married to Charlotte Marshall of Boston when he was forty years old. They had one daughter who died at the age of five. To appease his sorrow, his friend Hawthorne wrote him: &quot;... I trust you will be able to feel that though it is good to have a dear child on earth, it is likewise good to have one safe in heaven. She will await you there and it will seem like home to you now. Affectionately, Nath&quot;. While he seldom visited his home town, he kept the affection and respect of his townspeople to a most unusual degree. His friends there remembered him as a remarkable old man, whose clear mind and strong memory would have done credit to a man in the prime of life. He was also noted for his military bearing and elastic step. Concerning his fine character, the &quot;Kennebec Journal&quot; said: &quot;Commodore Bridge was a man of sterling principles and rugged honesty, with a strong mind and a warm heart; a gentleman of the old school in all that means, of broad culture and with a genial polished manner&quot;.

==Last years and legacy==
Upon final retirement, on March 1, 1871, he went to his country home, &quot;The Moorings&quot;, at Athens, Pennsylvania, where he spent the rest of his life. Here, according to &quot;The Athens News&quot;, he was an exemplary Christian and for many years had been an earnest and devout member of the Episcopal Church. Following Bridge&#x27;s death in March 1893, he was buried in Athens.

Two US Navy ships have been named in his honor: USS &quot;Bridge&quot; (AF-1) and USS &quot;Bridge&quot; (AOE-10).

<text>The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Bahamas, usually simply called U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas, is an official position and title appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate by majority vote. The ambassador oversees diplomatic relations and foreign policy between the United States and the Bahamas. The ambassador lives in Nassau, the nation&#x27;s capital.

Due to political disputes, the United States Senate has not confirmed an ambassador to the Bahamas since November 2011, with the post either remaining vacant or held by interim appointees who are not ambassadors. Cassandra Butts, nominated for the post by President Barack Obama in 2013, died of leukemia in 2016, having spent more than two years awaiting a vote on her appointment. President Donald Trump nominated Doug Manchester in 2017 but the nomination stalled and he eventually withdrew. In May 2020, President Trump nominated William A. Douglass for the position; his nomination was eventually withdrawn by President Joe Biden in February 2021. In May 2022, President Biden nominated Calvin Smyre for the position. As of December 2024, Smyre&#x27;s nomination remained pending before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On December 18, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he had nominated Herschel Walker to serve in the role.

<text>Evans Island is an island in the Prince William Sound of southern Alaska. It lies just east of Bainbridge Island across the Prince of Wales Passage. Elrington Island lies to its south, Latouche Island to its southeast, and Knight Island to its northeast. Although Evans Island had been inhabited up to the time of the Russian exploration of Alaska, the island had no modern-day inhabitants until 1984, when a group of residents and former residents of the original Alutiq village of Chenega, on Chenega Island, decided to build the village of Chenega Bay on Crab Bay on Evans Island. Old Chenega had been destroyed and one-third of its residents had been killed by the tsunami from the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The new community of Chenega is coextensive with Evans Island, which has a land area of 74.605 km2 (28.805 sq mi) and a population of 86 persons as of the 2000 census.

Evans Island and the ocean around it was polluted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.

Evans Island was called &quot;Hoodoo Island&quot; before 1912. The name frightened some sailors. The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey renamed the island in honor of United States Navy Admiral Robley Evans (1846–1912), who had been a maritime policeman in the area early in his career.

==Early life==
Giedroyc was born on 5 June 1968 in Epsom, Surrey, and grew up in Leatherhead. Her father, Michal, an aircraft designer, civil engineer and family historian, of Polish-Lithuanian descent from the aristocratic Giedroyć family, had moved to Britain in 1947; he died in December 2017. 

Her mother, Rosemary &quot;Rosy&quot; Cumpston (1937–2024), was of English origin. Her older sister is film and television director Coky Giedroyc. After moving to Oxford as a teenager Giedroyc attended the independent Oxford High School and later attended Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a lower second degree in French and Italian.

==Career==
===Television===
Giedroyc met Sue Perkins while they were students at the University of Cambridge and members of the Footlights comedy club. Mel and Sue were short-listed for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; Best Newcomers Award at the Edinburgh Festival in 1993. Their first presenting roles saw them host a lunchtime show on Channel 4 called &quot;Light Lunch&quot; (and the early evening version, &quot;Late Lunch&quot;). In 1996, she appeared with Perkins in four episodes of the BBC One sketch comedy series &quot;French and Saunders&quot;.

Reviewing the programme, in &quot;The Psychologist&quot;, Petrina Cox described it as &quot;an engaging and valuable education for the general public about the nature of anxiety disorders such as specific phobias. It is sure to reduce stigma, inspire hope and encourage people to seek evidence-based treatments... &quot;

On 12 November 2014, Giedroyc guest hosted an episode of &quot;The One Show&quot; with Alex Jones.

On 13 May 2023 Giedroyc was UK co-commentator at the Eurovision Song Contest final, alongside Graham Norton. In a reference to the 2014 Polish Eurovision entry &quot;My Słowianie&quot; and to Giedroyc&#x27;s own Polish heritage, she appeared as a Polish milkmaid, suggestively churning butter behind host Hannah Waddingham, as Waddingham introduced Armenia&#x27;s performance after the intermission.

<text>Florence May Chadwick (November 9, 1918 – March 15, 1995) was an American swimmer known for long-distance open water swimming. She was the first woman to swim across the English Channel in both directions, setting a time record each time. She was also the first woman to swim the Catalina Channel, the Straits of Gibraltar, the Bosporus (one way), and the Dardanelles (round trip).

== Biography ==

Florence May Chadwick was born in San Diego on November 8, 1918. Her parents were Richard Chadwick, a police officer, and Mary Lacko, a homemaker who later operated a San Diego restaurant. Chadwick grew up in the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego and graduated from Point Loma Junior-Senior High School in 1936. She attended San Diego State College and studied at several law schools and a business college. She was married and divorced twice, and had no children.

===Early swimming and instruction===
Chadwick entered swimming competitions from a young age, scoring her first win at the age of ten, but she realized she preferred ocean events rather than pool swims. Chadwick first began instruction and competition with 1924 Olympian Florence Chambers, and the Florence Chambers Swim Club in San Diego at the age of 9, around 1927, and continued to swim with the Chambers Club through around 1932, when she switched to the Los Angeles Athletic Club.

At the age of 10, she became the youngest person to swim across the mouth of San Diego Bay. Starting at age eleven, she competed in rough water swims, winning an annual 2.5-mile race in the ocean off La Jolla, North of San Diego, 10 times in 18 years.

====Early pool and open water wins====
Highly accomplished as a young competitive swimmer, Chadwick won the 100-yard backstroke event at the Junior AAU National Championship at age 14 in May 1933 with a time of 1:17, and the following August won the junior 500-meter freestyle event at the 1933 Southern Pacific National AAU Swimming and Diving Championships in Los Angeles. Chadwick&#x27;s early instructor Florence Chambers won the 500-meter freestyle in the Women&#x27;s adult division at the 1933 AAU Nationals, the same event Chadwick won as a junior competitor.

When Chadwick won the two-mile Los Angeles Hermosa Beach Roughwater Swim with a time of 54:23 while swimming for the San Diego Athletic Club on July 2, 1933, her early instructor Florence Chambers, placed fifth. On July 4, 1933, Chadwick handily won the 600-yard Venice Roughwater Swim for Women with a time of 15 minutes flat. Chadwick swam in Southern California ocean races as an amateur for several decades, but had her heart set to swim across the English Channel.

===First English Channel swims===
In 1950 Chadwick attempted to enter a 1950 Channel-swimming contest sponsored by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; but was refused for lack of a significant reputation. Determined to complete the swim at her own expense, she failed in July after 14 hours in the water.
On August 8, 1950, at the age of 32, she crossed the English Channel from France to England in 13 hours and 23 minutes, breaking the then-current women&#x27;s record held by American swimmer Gertrude Ederle. One year later, Chadwick crossed the channel again, from England to France this time, in 16 hours and 22 minutes, thus making her the first woman to swim across the channel in both directions, and setting a record for the England-France journey. She ultimately swam the Channel four times.

===Catalina Island===
In 1952, Florence attempted to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and were prepared to help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who was in one of the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.

===Distance swim highlights===
During the summer of 1953, she successfully swam the Channel again (setting a new women&#x27;s record), as well as the Strait of Gibraltar (setting an all-time record of 5:06), the Bosporus, and the Dardanelles. In 1955 she swam the Channel again, breaking her own record time. In August 1957 she swam the Bristol Channel from Weston-super-Mare to Penarth Head, 11 miles in a record-breaking 6 hours 7 mins.

Not all of her long-distance swim attempts were successful. In 1954, she tried to become the first person to swim across Lake Ontario but gave up after becoming ill a few hours into her swim. Other unsuccessful attempts included the Strait of Juan de Fuca and two tries at the Irish Sea (her last major swim attempt in 1960).

===Other employment===
She gave product endorsements and served for many years as the spokesperson for Catalina Swimwear. She taught swimming at a number of venues and worked with Esther Williams to design movie swimming sequences. She also worked as a credit counselor and stockbroker, and was an executive at San Diego&#x27;s First Wall Street Corporation.

She died at San Diego&#x27;s Mercy Hospital of leukemia on March 15, 1995. After cremation, her ashes were scattered into the ocean off San Diego&#x27;s Point Loma, not too distant from where she grew up, went to High School, and completed many of her earliest open water swims in La Jolla and San Diego Harbor.

== Recognition and honors ==
In December 1951, Chadwick appeared as herself in &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot; musical series on CBS television. The program highlighted Chadwick&#x27;s hometown of San Diego.

On October 30, 1955, she appeared as a guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

In 1962, Chadwick was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into its Breitbard Hall of Fame.

In 1970, as a career highlight, she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

<text>In music, quartal harmony is the building of harmonic structures built from the intervals of the perfect fourth, the augmented fourth and the diminished fourth. For instance, a three-note quartal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fourths, C–F–B. 

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 4/4 &lt;c f bes&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;

Quintal harmony is harmonic structure preferring the perfect fifth, the augmented fifth and the diminished fifth. For instance, a three-note quintal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fifths, C–G–D. 

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 4/4 &lt;c g&#x27; d&#x27;&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;

== Properties ==

The terms &quot;quartal&quot; and &quot;quintal&quot; imply a contrast, either compositional or perceptual, with traditional harmonic constructions based on thirds: listeners familiar with music of the common practice period are guided by tonalities constructed with familiar elements: the chords that make up major and minor scales, all in turn built from major and minor thirds.

Regarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer Vincent Persichetti writes that:
&quot;Quintal harmony&quot; (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the inversion or complement of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from &quot;quartal harmony&quot;. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.

Like tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different voicings, some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C–F–B, can be written as
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 4/4 &lt;c f bes&gt;1 &lt;f bes c&gt; &lt;bes c f&gt; &lt;f bes c f&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==History==
In the Middle Ages, simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance. During the common practice period (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a dissonance (when appearing as a suspension requiring resolution in the voice leading) or as a consonance (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord). In the later 19th century, during the breakdown of tonality in classical music, all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed. Quartal harmony was developed in the early 20th century as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.

===Precursors===
The Tristan chord is made up of the notes F, B, D and G and is the first chord heard in Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.

 »
&lt;/score&gt;

The bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant. The chord had been found in earlier works, notably Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 18, but Wagner&#x27;s use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional tonal harmony and even towards atonality, and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its function, a notion which was soon after to be explored by Debussy and others. 

Despite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as &quot;quartal harmony&quot; or even as &quot;proto-quartal harmony&quot;, since Wagner&#x27;s musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary dominant seventh chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F–B–D–G). Wagner&#x27;s unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.

At the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. Scriabin used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his Mystic chord (shown below) in his Piano Sonata No. 6. 

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 4/4 &lt;c fis bes e a d&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;

Scriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional tertian passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C–F–B–E–A–D) into a seven-note chord (C–F–B–E–A–D–G). Scriabin&#x27;s sketches for his unfinished work &quot;Mysterium&quot; show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the chromatic scale.

In France, Erik Satie experimented with planing in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for &quot;Le Fils des étoiles&quot;. Paul Dukas&#x27;s &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to &quot;rise and rise&quot;.

===20th- and 21st-century classical music===
Composers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include Claude Debussy, Francis Poulenc, Alexander Scriabin, Alban Berg, Leonard Bernstein, Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Joe Hisaishi and Anton Webern.

==== Schoenberg ====
Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony Op. 9 (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measure and a half construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes (highlighted in red in the illustration) A–D–F–B–E–A distributed over the five stringed instruments (the viola must tune down the lowest string by a minor third, and read in the unfamiliar tenor clef).

The composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).

Schoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his &quot;Theory of Harmony&quot; (&quot;Harmonielehre&quot;) of 1911, he wrote:
For Anton Webern, the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote &quot;You must write something like that, too!&quot;

==== Others ====
In his &quot;Theory of Harmony&quot;: &quot;Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and Alban Berg have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian Béla Bartók or the Viennese Franz Schreker, who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also Puccini, are not far off.&quot;
French composer Maurice Ravel used quartal chords in Sonatine (1906) and &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; (1910), while American Charles Ives used quartal chords in his song &quot;The Cage&quot; (1906).

Hindemith constructed large parts of his symphonic work &quot;&quot; by means of fourth and fifth intervals. These steps are a restructuring of fourth chords (C–D–G becomes the fourth chord D–G–C), or other mixtures of fourths and fifths (D–A–D–G–C in measure 3 of the example).

Hindemith was, however, not a proponent of an explicit quartal harmony. In his 1937 writing &quot;Unterweisung im Tonsatz&quot; (&quot;The Craft of Musical Composition&quot;,) he wrote that &quot;notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,&quot; so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition &quot;...the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.&quot; He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. &quot;The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its Combination tones.&quot;
The works of the Filipino composer (1915–1984) are characterised by quartal and quintal harmonies, as well as by dissonant counterpoint and polychords.

As a transition to the history of jazz, George Gershwin may be mentioned. In the first movement of his Concerto in F altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.

===Jazz===

Jazz is often understood as a synthesis of the European common practice harmonic vocabulary with textural paradigms from West African folk music—but it would be an oversimplification to describe jazz as sharing the same fundamental theory of harmony as European music. Important influences come from opera as well as from the instrumental work of Classical- and Romantic-era composers, and even that of the Impressionists. From the beginning, jazz musicians expressed a particular interest in rich harmonic colours, for which non-tertiary harmony was a means of exploration, as used by pianists and arrangers like Jelly Roll Morton, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, Bill Evans, Milt Buckner, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and especially McCoy Tyner.


The hard bop of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz. Quintet writing in which two melodic instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony. This style of writing, in contrast with that of the previous decade, preferred a moderate tempo. Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined polyphony such as is found in cool jazz.

On his watershed record &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, Miles Davis with pianist Bill Evans used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition &quot;So What&quot;. This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a So What chord, and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom.

From the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist McCoy Tyner&#x27;s work with saxophonist John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;classic quartet&quot;, was influential throughout this epoch. Oliver Nelson was also known for his use of fourth chord voicings. Tom Floyd claims that the &quot;foundation of &#x27;modern quartal harmony&#x27;&quot; began in the era when the Charlie Parker–influenced John Coltrane added classically trained pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner to his ensemble.

Jazz guitarists cited as using chord voicings using quartal harmony include Johnny Smith, Tal Farlow, Chuck Wayne, Barney Kessel, Joe Pass, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery—however, all in a traditional manner, as major 9th, 13th and minor 11th chords (an octave and fourth equals an 11th). Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include Jim Hall (especially Sonny Rollins&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge&quot;), George Benson (&quot;Sky Dive&quot;), Pat Martino, Jack Wilkins (&quot;Windows&quot;), Joe Diorio, Howard Roberts, Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, Henry Johnson, Russell Malone, Jimmy Bruno, Howard Alden, Bill Frisell, Paul Bollenback, Mark Whitfield, and Rodney Jones.

Quartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental scale models as they were &quot;discovered&quot; by jazz. Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called church modes of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists Herbie Hancock, and Chick Corea are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as free jazz also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use, owing to the wandering nature of its harmony.

In jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called voicing, and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.

Thus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to &quot;blend into one overall sound&quot; sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus.

===Rock music===

Quartal and quintal harmony have been used by Robert Fripp, guitarist of King Crimson. Fripp dislikes minor thirds and especially major thirds in equal temperament tuning, which is used by non-experimental guitars. The perfect fourths and fifths of just intonation are well approximated in equal temperament tuning, and perfect fifths and octaves are highly consonant intervals. Fripp builds chords using perfect fifths, fourths, and octaves in his new standard tuning (NST), a regular tuning having perfect fifths between its successive open strings.

The 1971 album &quot;Tarkus&quot; by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer depends on quartal harmony throughout, including a recurrent elaboration on the classical Alberti bass pattern, in this case consisting of three broken quartal three-note chords, the first two of which are also a perfect fourth apart, and the third a semitone higher than the first. Keith Emerson uses programmatic quintal harmony in several places for extended rapid obbligato passages where human fingering would be impracticable, the first on Hammond organ and the second on Modular Moog, in a similar manner to the mutation stops on pipe organs, such as the &quot;Twelfth&quot; at 2 2/3&#x27; pitch played against a 4&#x27; &quot;Principal&quot; (which plays the eighth note). In the second instance, the triad is both quartal and quintal, being 1+4+5.

Ray Manzarek of The Doors was another keyboard player and composer who put classical and jazz elements, including quartal harmonies, into the service of rock music. The keyboard solo of &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, for instance, has several passages where the melody line is doubled at an interval of a perfect fourth, and extensive use of (E dorian) minor chord voicings featuring the seven and three, spaced by that same interval, as the prominent notes.

<doc id="945138" wikidata="Q3273225" url="?curid=945138" title="Ford MT75 transmission">
<text>The MT75 is a rear wheel drive or four wheel drive gearbox, depending on the variant, made by the Ford Motor Company. The MT75 replaced the Ford Type 9 transmission.

The MT75 has an all alloy casing and comes with an integrated bellhousing. In 4x4 versions, the planetary gear center differential with viscous-type limited slip is integrated in to the rear half of the gearbox. The 4x4 system is of full-time type with a static torque split of 34% front, 66% rear (similarly to Type 9 4x4 models).

The MT75 has five speeds and reverse. This was the first Ford production gearbox to have a synchromesh on reverse (so reverse can be selected whilst in slight forward motion).
The internal gear assembly in order from front to back as installed on the mainshaft is as follows: 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, Reverse with 5th gear situated at the rear towards the output (propshaft flange), all gears are of a helical cut. Refined over time with slight improvement made to the synchros, phasing out single part synchromeshes on 1st &amp; 2nd gear in favour of three part syncro&#x27;s.

The designation breaks down as, &quot;M&quot; for manual, &quot;T&quot; for transmission, and &quot;75&quot; for the distance in millimetres between the main and layshaft centers.

Common failures include:
* Mainshafts wear through the hardening (1st to 3rd roller) on the journals resulting in noise
* Front and or rear bearing failure
* Brass Selector forks wear out (jumps out of gear) although this can also be caused by worn dogs &amp; windows on hubs (less common)
* Nose cone / Guide tube becomes loose, loss of oil &amp; burnt out gearbox
* Laygear bearings wear out
* Spigot wear / first motion 4th gear separation / loss of drive

Used in the Sierra, Granada, and Scorpio II, it came in various flavours for each engine and was used in two wheel drive and four wheel drive (MT75 4x4) versions (four wheel drive in the 4x4 Sapphire Cosworth, Escort Cosworth and XR4x4). This transmission, like the Type 9, is already used in uprated classic cars and hot rods, especially if a Ford Pinto engine, a multi valve 4-cylinder or Rover V8 engine is used.

It should not be confused with the MTX-75 which is a completely different gearbox for front wheel drive models such as the Mondeo, Ford Escort (Europe) also latterly adapted for use in Jaguars &amp; Transit connect vans.</text><links>

<doc id="945143" wikidata="Q1509410" url="?curid=945143" title="Naval Base Kitsap">
<text>Naval Base Kitsap is a U.S. Navy base located on the Kitsap Peninsula in Washington state, created in 2004 by merging the former Naval Station Bremerton with Naval Submarine Base Bangor. It is the home base for the Navy’s fleet throughout West Puget Sound, provides base operating services, support for both surface ships and fleet ballistic missile and other nuclear submarines as one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s four nuclear shipyards, one of two strategic nuclear weapons facilities, and the only West Coast dry dock capable of handling a &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier and the Navy&#x27;s largest fuel depot. Naval Base Kitsap is the third-largest Navy base in the U.S. The base has a workforce of 15,601 active duty personnel.

It also provides service, programs, and facilities for their hosted combat commands, tenant activities, ships&#x27; crews, and civilian employees. It is the largest naval organization in Navy Region Northwest, and composed of installations at Bremerton, Bangor, Indian Island, Manchester, and Keyport, Washington. It received the 2005 and 2017 Commander in Chief&#x27;s Award for Installation Excellence - the Best Base in the U.S. Navy.

==History==

===Bangor===

Serving the U.S. Pacific Fleet, this base is one of only two such Trident submarine bases operated by the U.S. Navy: the base at Kings Bay, Georgia, used by the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, is the other. Nearby is Strategic Weapons Facility Pacific (SWFPAC), where submarine-launched ballistic missiles are stored and maintained.

===Bremerton ===
This installation is home to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility. In addition to performing drydock and overhaul services for active naval vessels, it is also home to an inactive ship facility for several decommissioned warships, including aircraft carriers.

Naval Base Kitsap is also home to Naval Hospital Bremerton.

===Protest===
In November 2009, five protesters, including 82-year-old priest William J. Bichsel, S.J., cut through two fences to reach an area near where nuclear warheads are stored in bunkers. The protesters put up banners, sprinkled blood on the ground, scattered sunflower seeds and prayed until they were arrested; all faced prison sentences. Bichsel was released from federal prison on February 9, 2012.

==Environment==
In 2010, after purchasing the base&#x27;s first hybrid bus on April 29, 2010, Naval Base Kitsap purchased two additional hybrid buses, with five others to be delivered by the end of July. The diesel-electric vehicles are the Navy&#x27;s first hybrids and were funded through the GSA American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Replacement/Exchange Program and are overseen by NAVFAC, the Navy&#x27;s non-tactical vehicle program manager.

In March 2020, private water wells of homes surrounding Bangor have been found to be contaminated with PFAS; one was found to have more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS.

<doc id="945145" wikidata="Q143233" url="?curid=945145" title="Mauritania at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Mauritania competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. The country&#x27;s participation at Athens marked its sixth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two track and field athletes, Youba Hmeida and Aminata Kamissoko, who were both selected by wildcards after both failed to meet either the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; qualifying standards. Hmeida was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Neither of the Mauritanians progressed beyond the heats.

==Background==
Mauritania participated in six Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The Mauritania National Olympic Committee (NOC) selected two athletes via wildcards. Usually, an NOC would be able to enter up to 3 qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the &quot;A&quot; standard, or 1 athlete per event if they met the &quot;B&quot; standard. However, since Mauritania had no athletes that met either standard, they were allowed to select two athletes, one of each gender, as wildcards. The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Athens games were Youba Hmeida in the Men&#x27;s 400 meters and Aminata Kamissoko in the Women&#x27;s 100 meters. Hmeida was flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

==Athletics==

Making his Summer Olympics debut, Youba Hmeida was notable for carrying the Mauritania flag at the opening ceremony. He qualified for the Summer Olympics via a wildcard place, as his best time, 47.87 seconds at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics 400 meters, was 1.92 seconds slower than the &quot;B&quot; standard required. He competed on 20 August in Heat 3 against seven other athletes. He ran a time of 49.18 seconds, finishing seventh after Russia&#x27;s Anton Galkin was disqualified. El Salvador&#x27;s Takeshi Fujiwara placed ahead of him (46.70 seconds), in a heat led by Cuba&#x27;s Yeimer López (45.44 seconds). Out of 63 athletes, Hmeida ranked 57 and was 3.30 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-finals. Therefore, that was the end of his competition.
Competing at her first Summer Olympics, Aminata Kamissoko qualified after being granted a wildcard as her best time, 13.70 seconds in the 2003 World Championships in Athletics 100 meters, was 2.30 seconds slower than the &quot;B&quot; qualifying standard. She competed on August 20 in Heat 3 against seven other athletes, finishing last with a time of 13.49 seconds. Palau&#x27;s Ngerak Florencio ranked ahead of her (12.76 seconds), in a heat led by United States&#x27; Lauryn Williams. Overall, Kamissoko was 2.06 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed, therefore not advancing to the quarter-finals.

== Early life ==
Shin Hae-chul was born on May 6, 1968. He enrolled in Sogang University in 1987, where he studied philosophy until he dropped out to focus on his music career.

==Career==

=== Debut ===
Shin formed the band Muhangwedo () in 1988 when he was a sophomore at Sogang University. The band received national attention when it appeared on the televised 1988 MBC Campus Music Festival, a singing competition for amateurs. Muhangwedo won first place for the song &quot;To You&quot; () which was written by Shin. The band released one album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;When Our Lives Are Almost Over&quot; ().

=== Early solo career ===
Shin released his first solo album in 1990, which included a song that had an English rap, which was unconventional in the Korean music scene at the time. The album was a huge hit, leading to Shin rising to the top of Korean pop music charts and receiving multiple Korean pop music awards. His second solo album, Myself, was released in 1991, which was first album in Korea to have used midi. He also started a gig as a radio DJ on MBC FM.

=== The N.EX.T years ===
In 1992, Shin formed the band N.EX.T — moving from pop music to rock. Their first album, &quot;Home&quot;, was a concept album. While his previous songs were mainly about love or heartache, here Shin started to write more about social issues, such as criticizing the fast lifestyle of urbanites in &quot;City People&quot;. The group&#x27;s second album was released in 1994 titled &quot;The Return of N.EX.T Part 1: The Being&quot; where Shin introduced more philosophical lyrics, such as questioning the meaning of life in the song &quot;The Ocean: About Immortality&quot;. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Return of N.EX.T Part 2: World&quot;. Some of the band members changed over time, with Shin being the constant lead singer/songwriter.

During this time he also did a one-time collaboration with singer Yoon Sang to form Nodance, wrote the original sound track for the Korean movie &quot;Jungle Story&quot;, and was the DJ for the MBC FM radio program &quot;FM Music City&quot; from 1996 to 1997. In 1996, he created his own label, Big Bang Music.

In 1997 N.EX.T released a rock ballad single, &quot;Here, I Stand for You&quot; which sold 500,000 copies in South Korea. (The lyrics of this song are engraved on his tombstone). The band went on to release their fourth album &quot;Lazenca: A Space Rock Opera&quot; in November 1997, which was also the original sound track for the television animation series &quot;Lazenca&quot;. The band split up after this- Shin went on to study music producing in London.

=== Crom ===

In London, Shin re-named himself Crom (inspired by Cromwell) and released a techno album &quot;Crom&#x27;s Techno Works&quot; in 1998. The following year, he formed a project group Monocrom with guitarist Chris Tsangarides and released the eponymous project album &quot;Monocrom&quot;. The music in the album was experimental, combining heavy metal with Korean folk music, rap, and lyrical rock ballads. Most of the songs in this album were in English, which he collaborated with lyricist D. Yvette Wohn. After the release of &quot;Monocrom&quot;, Shin went to New York where he worked on producing his live album and some Korean movie soundtracks. In 2000, he created a three-man band Wittgenstein to produce a home studio album of the same name. He also wrote the song &quot;Zergs are Coming&quot; for the StarCraft music album.

=== Return of N.EX.T ===

Shin returned to Korea in 2002 and worked on various projects, mainly writing songs for other artists or for movie soundtracks. In 2004, he re-formed the group N.EX.T although the members were different, and released a double album &quot;The Return of N.EX.T Part 3: 개한민국&quot;. He also started DJing for a late night radio show &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; that became extremely popular. In 2007, N.EX.T released a jazz album &quot;The Songs for the One&quot; inspired by his newborn daughter. In 2008, the band released the album &quot;666 Trilogy&quot;. After a long break, the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Reboot Myself&quot; was released in 2014.

=== Producer ===
Shin participated in special project in 2004, with the best musicians of Korea, the album named as
&quot;Tribute to Park Nohae&#x27;s Collection of poems &quot;The Dawn of Labor&quot; 20th anniversary&quot;. It is the first attempted project which the recordings dedicated to poetry in the history of Korean music. And he sang &quot;Heaven&quot; () with Psy on this album.

=== Radio DJ ===

Throughout his career Shin hosted several radio programs, including &quot;Music City with Shin Hae Chul&quot; and &quot;GhostStation with Shin Hae Chul&quot; After supporting and campaigning for the president Roh Moo-hyun in 2002 election, Mr. Shin hosts the popular &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; on MBC, a late-night radio program since 2003. His fans call him &quot;Mawang&quot; (마왕 &#x27;the Demon Lord&#x27;).

On September 16, 2007, Shin ended &quot;Ghost Nation&quot;. But he also announced that the broadcasting will be continuously served through the web, but no more broadcasting through MBC.

==Personal life==
He married Yoon Won-hee () on September 29, 2002, just before the 2002 election. He released his first jazz album &quot;The Songs for the One&quot; in 2007, dedicated to his wife and daughter.

Shin was found to be suffering from prosopagnosia, on a TV show (MBC Goldfish) in which he made a guest appearance. After that, he hosted a brand-new TV comedy debate program &quot;100-second Debate&quot; (since May 2007), with a similar format of the MBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Minute Debate&quot;. On July 29, 2007, he appeared as a victim (guest) of Lee Kyung-kyu&#x27;s &quot;Hidden Camera&quot;.

=== Death ===
Shin was treated for gastrointestinal problems by Dr. Kang Se Hoon at Sky Hospital on October 17, 2014. Kang carried out stomach reduction surgery without consent from Shin. During surgery, Kang punctured Shin&#x27;s upper small intestine and pericardium, which later resulted in peritonitis. After developing a fever, which he was told was normal after surgery, Shin suffered a heart attack on October 22, and died on October 27 from peritonitis, pericarditis, sepsis, and brain damage due to lack of oxygen. At the urging of friends, Shin&#x27;s family stopped his cremation at short notice and requested an autopsy. In March 2015, Songpa police found that Shin Hae-chul died from medical malpractice. Kang was struck off the medical register, fined and sentenced to one year in jail. The death of Shin through malpractice led to a revision of the law in South Korea to allow a state-run agency to help in malpractice cases. The law is referred to as the &quot;Shin Hae-chul Law.&quot;

===Tributes===
Psy&#x27;s song &quot;Dream&quot; was released in 2015 as a tribute to Shin. The lyrics were based on &quot;talks with him about philosophy and death while drinking with him&quot; which he answered &quot;maybe all our lives might be a dream&quot;. Thus the profits from the particular song were planned to be donated to his bereaved family.

<doc id="945157" wikidata="Q833195" url="?curid=945157" title="Bloomberg Businessweek">
<text>Bloomberg Businessweek, previously known as BusinessWeek (and before that Business Week and The Business Week), is an American monthly business magazine published 12 times a year. The magazine debuted in New York City in September 1929. Since 2009, the magazine has been owned by Bloomberg L.P. and became a monthly in June 2024.

==History==

=== 1929–2008: &quot;Businessweek&quot; ===
&quot;The Business Week&quot; was first published based in New York City in September 1929, weeks before the stock market crash of 1929. The magazine provided information and opinions on what was happening in the business world at the time. Early sections of the magazine included marketing, labor, finance, management and Washington Outlook, which made &quot;The Business Week&quot; one of the first publications to cover national political issues that directly impacted the business world. The name of the magazine was shortened to &quot;Business Week&quot; in 1934.

Originally published as a resource for business managers, in the 1970s, the magazine shifted its strategy and added consumers outside the business world. , the magazine was carrying more advertising pages annually than any other magazine in the United States. In 1976 and 1977, the magazine&#x27;s name&#x27;s form was changed from &quot;Business Week&quot; to &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;.

Stephen B. Shepard served as editor-in-chief from 1984 until 2005 when he was chosen to be the founding dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Under Shepard, &quot;Businessweek&quot;″s readership grew to more than six million in the late 1980s. He was succeeded by Stephen J. Adler of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

&quot;Businessweek&quot; began publishing its annual rankings of United States business school MBA programs in 1988. In 2006, &quot;Businessweek&quot; started publishing annual rankings of undergraduate business programs in addition to its MBA program listing.

=== 2009–present: &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; ===
&quot;Businessweek&quot; suffered a decline in circulation during the late-2000s recession as advertising revenues fell one-third by the start of 2009 and the magazine&#x27;s circulation fell to 936,000. In July 2009, it was reported that McGraw-Hill was trying to sell &quot;Businessweek&quot; and had hired Evercore Partners to conduct the sale. Because of the magazine&#x27;s liabilities, it was suggested that it might change hands for the nominal price of $1 to an investor who was willing to incur losses turning the magazine around.

In late 2009, Bloomberg L.P. bought the magazine—reportedly for between $2million to $5million plus assumption of liabilities—and renamed it &quot;Bloomberg BusinessWeek&quot;. 
News reports published in 2019 suggest McGraw-Hill received the high end of the speculated price, at $5million, along with the assumption of debt.

In early 2010, the magazine title was restyled &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; (with a lowercase &quot;w&quot;) as part of a redesign. During the following years, the bold, eclectic, playful, and memetic face of &quot;Businessweek&quot; was cultivated largely by &quot;Businessweek&quot; Creative director, Richard Turley then Rob Vargas (from 2014), and Deputy Creative director Tracy Ma (from 2011 through 2016). During her time at &quot;Businessweek&quot;, Ma worked on over 200 issues.

, the magazine was losing $30million per year, about half of the $60million it was reported losing in 2009. Adler resigned as editor-in-chief and was replaced by Josh Tyrangiel, who had been deputy managing editor of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 2016, Bloomberg announced changes to &quot;Businessweek&quot;, which was losing between $20 and $30 million. Nearly 30 Bloomberg News journalists were let go across the U.S., Europe and Asia and it was announced that a new version of &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; would launch the following year. In addition, editor in chief Ellen Pollock stepped down from her position and Washington Bureau Chief Megan Murphy was named as the next editor in chief. Megan Murphy served as editor from November 2016; until she stepped down from the role in January 2018 and Joel Weber was appointed by the editorial board in her place.

Brad Stone was appointed editor of the magazine in January 2024, when the magazine switched to publishing bi-weekly. In June of the same year, the magazine became a monthly.

== Controversy ==

=== &quot;The Big Hack&quot; ===
On October 4, 2018, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; published &quot;The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies&quot;, an article by Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley which claimed that China had hacked dozens of technology corporations including Amazon and Apple by placing an extra integrated circuit on a Supermicro server motherboard during manufacturing.

Pingwest, a media company founded in Silicon Valley and based in Beijing, identified the chip mentioned in the article as a balun. Pingwest pointed out that its size made it impossible to implement any form of attack; it did not have the storage space required to store commands that would allow a hacker to infiltrate the hardware. They suggested that &quot;Businessweek&quot; had underestimated security standards employed by Amazon and Apple.

The claims by Bloomberg have been heavily questioned. By 2 p.m. on the day of publication, Apple, Amazon, and Supermicro issued blanket denials, which Bloomberg reported. Within the week, the United States Department of Homeland Security stated that it saw no reason to question those refutations. The National Security Agency and Government Communications Headquarters and NCSC also denied the article&#x27;s claims.

In 2021, Bloomberg published a follow-up article standing by its allegations.

==Additional versions==
International editions of &quot;Businessweek&quot; were available on newsstands in Europe and Asia until 2005 when publication of regional editions was suspended to help increase foreign readership of customized European and Asian versions of &quot;Businessweek&quot; website. However, the same year the Russian edition was launched in collaboration with Rodionov Publishing House.

At the same time, &quot;Businessweek&quot; partnered with InfoPro Management, a publishing and market research company based in Beirut, Lebanon, to produce the Arabic version of the magazine in 22 Arab countries.

In 2011, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; continued the magazine&#x27;s international expansion and announced plans to introduce a Polish-language edition called &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek Polska&quot;, as well as a Chinese edition which was relaunched in November 2011.

&quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; launched an iPad version of the magazine using Apple&#x27;s subscription billing service in 2011. The iPad edition was the first to use this subscription method, which allows one to subscribe via an iTunes account. There are over 100,000 subscribers to the iPad edition of &quot;Businessweek&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
In the year 2011, &quot;Adweek &quot; named &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; as the top business magazine in the country. In 2012, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; won the general excellence award for general-interest magazines at the National Magazine Awards. Also in 2012, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; editor Josh Tyrangiel was named magazine editor of the year by &quot;Ad Age&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; won a Society of American Business Editors and Writers Best in Business award for magazines, general excellence.

In 2016, the Online Journalism Awards highlighted &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;&#x27;s explanatory reporting work on “What Is Code?”

<text>Fire police are fire department members who, based upon their jurisdictional authority, receive sworn police powers, special training, and support firefighting efforts at emergency incidents. In addition to securing firefighting equipment, incident and fire scenes, and the station itself, fire police perform traffic and crowd control. In some jurisdictions, fire police are exterior firefighters and may be called upon at fire scenes to perform any of the duties of an interior firefighter except those that require a self-contained breathing apparatus. On occasion, fire police also assist regular police: they perform road closures, traffic control, crowd control at public events, missing persons searches, parade details, salvage, security, and other miscellaneous tasks as requested.

==Duties==

Fire police are a fire department resource and answer to the officer in charge (OIC) of the fire brigade in attendance. However, special fire police officers in Pennsylvania, USA, are under the direction of the state or local police. Where no other fire brigade resources are present, fire police will usually assist police under the direction of the police&#x27;s OIC or, depending on local regulations, act autonomously.

While the exact role of fire police may vary between brigades and between countries, the general themes are constant throughout:

=== Traffic control at emergency scenes ===
Traffic control consists of managing the flow of vehicles around or through the immediate vicinity of an emergency. This may entail road closures, diversions, full &#x27;points&#x27; control at intersections, or &#x27;1-way-shunts&#x27;, in which the road is reduced to one lane and its direction is alternated in a controlled fashion.

=== Scene safety ===
Fire police assist in ensuring that the scene of an incident remains safe for firefighters, emergency service workers, and members of the public working in its vicinity.

=== Crowd control and liaison ===
Residents, owners, occupants, relatives, transients, spectators, and the media are among those who may approach the scene of an incident, and fire police prevent them from being harmed or hampering the work of emergency services personnel working at the scene. Since fire police are often the public&#x27;s first point of contact with the fire department, they must be skilled in public relations.

=== Scene security ===
Fire police may be asked to provide a scene guard in order to prevent looting or theft and monitor unattended fire brigade equipment.

=== Police assistance ===
Fire police are often called upon by police and other law enforcement agencies to provide additional manpower. Many of the tasks listed above also fall within the area of responsibility of the police, but fire police when on the scene may allow the police to concentrate on other more specific areas of expertise.

=== Logistics ===
Fire police may provide a logistics resource - vehicle movements, communications or similar. This would particularly be the case at a scene controlled by the fire brigade but they may be called upon by other services.

==Fire police around the world==
===Brazil===

In Brazil, the Military Firefighters Corps () are military public security forces, responsible for civil defense, firefighting and search and rescue inside the federative units. Since 1915, it has been a military reserve force and an auxiliary force of the Brazilian Army, also composing the Single System of Public Security (). Members of the Military Firefighters Corps, such as the members of the Military Police, are designated as being part of the military of the Federative Units by the Federal Constitution.

=== China ===
Prior to the 2018 formation of China Fire and Rescue, the People&#x27;s Armed Police was responsible for wildfire suppression.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, fire police formerly existed by virtue of Section 33 of the Fire Service Act 1975. The Fire Service Act allowed for the formation of volunteer fire police units (based on the approval of the district chief of police) and bestowed upon them the legal powers of a police constable. Several fire police units existed around New Zealand, some attached to volunteer fire brigades, and others acting as individual units and/or brigades in their own right.

Fire police in New Zealand engaged in all of the above listed roles. In areas where fire police did not exist, &quot;operational support&quot; members of the fire service carried out the same tasks (using the powers of a firefighter gained through Section 28 of the Fire Service Act). Firefighters (including operational support members) gained all the powers required to conduct their operations through Section 28; fire police wielded both these and the powers of a constable gained through Section 33. Operationally, fire police units and operational support units were generally considered to be equivalent, and were well valued by both the operational firefighters and the New Zealand Police.

====Future prospects====
A review of the Fire Service Act was announced in the late 2000s but a change of government placed this on hold. However, in the aftermath of the review of the Policing Act 2008 the NZ Fire Service announced its intention to have Section 33 of the Fire Service Act (allowing for fire police) repealed. With this in mind, fire police units across New Zealand have become operational support units, with a largely unchanged role, but without the powers of police. The powers of a constable are considered unnecessary, as all the functions of fire police were able to be legally carried out under Section 28 of the Act (powers of a chief fire officer) under delegation, except for the power of arrest.

==== Dissolution of Fire Police ====
In 2017, the Fire Services Act 1975 was repealed, and replaced with the Fire And Emergency New Zealand Act 2017. Under this new Act, Fire Police in New Zealand no longer exist in law.

=== India ===
The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Home Guard have fire wings.

=== Ancient Rome ===
The Vigiles had dual firefighting and policing duties.

===United States===
Fire police exist in thirteen states of the United States including Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Maine, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. They must take an oath of office and be sworn in by a municipal clerk or official, mayor, magistrate, judge, sheriff or justice of the peace - depending upon jurisdiction and local authorizing laws. At fire service incidents, fire police assume either the full or necessary powers of a police constable.

Some texts list Burlington County, New Jersey as forming one of the first fire police units. Laws in New Jersey State code as early as the 1850s supported fire police in their duties.

====Connecticut====
Unlike many other fire police departments, those in Connecticut do not necessarily have police powers or acts as sworn agents of a body of government. Instead, their authority flows directly from the fire chief of their parent fire department; however, this authority relates only to fire drills, emergencies within the fire district, and mutual aid situations. Nevertheless, the mayor or first selectman of some towns may give fire police constable status despite this worldwide custom.

The state of Connecticut requires that fire police officers are officially appointed by the fire chief, and it provides them with, among other things, distinctive badges of office, headgear, reflective equipment.

All Connecticut fire police are certified by the Connecticut Fire Police Association under the standards of the Connecticut Fire Academy, and many fire departments have specialized or modified their apparatus for traffic control. For instance, the Hebron volunteer fire company (Hebron, CT) has Service 310, a modified retired ambulance. Colchester Hayward volunteer fire company has Service 328, a utility pick-up truck that it has modified specifically for traffic control by equipping it to hold many cones and signs.

This is spelled out in Connecticut statute under Chapter 104, Section 7-313a.

====Maine====
Although Maine fire police are not peace officers and do not have any police powers, they may be sworn in as special police in some towns, albeit rarely. Special police are police officers appointed for one-year terms and given very limited authority by their township to carry out specified duties. For example, under Maine law, only a police officer may actually shut down a roadway, while fire police cannot.

However, in 2005, emergency workers in Maine received the authority to &quot;redirect traffic&quot; at emergency scenes as public safety traffic flaggers (PSTF&#x27;s). This new authority improved upon the previous custom of fire police doing so by citing the state law that allows them to use reasonable force to protect a fire scene. Moreover, the law requires anyone acting as a PSTF to be properly trained and wear appropriate safety gear. Furthermore, while PSTF duties are generally carried out by fire police, other department members with proper PSTF training may be pressed into duty at busy scenes.

See Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, Chapter 2091 - &quot;Control of vehicular traffic at emergency scenes&quot;.

====New York====
Under New York State law, Fire Police must complete a Fire Police certification course outlined by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice (NYS DCJS). After which, each fire police member is required to take an oath of office by either the AHJ (Chief/Assistant Chief) of the supporting fire company or the town, county or city clerks office and a copy of which must be kept on file in the town, county, city clerk&#x27;s office in the municipality in which they serve. The training coordinator must fill out and submit all paperwork concerning the course study and attendance to DCJS for each individual fire company. At that time, each individual person is now registered and certified as a Peace Officer by the State of New York. Fire police in New York State are peace officers as per Article 2.10 Subsection 41 of the states Criminal Procedure Law. When acting pursuant to their special duties and allowed by the fire agency, fire police have the powers of peace officers which are listed in Article 2.20 of the states Criminal Procedure Law. Peace officer status does grant fire police arrest powers however, they may not carry a firearm without additional licensing 

These duties are granted under Section 209 (c) of the General Municipal Law. As New York State peace officers, they are required to take an oath, a copy of which must be kept on file in the town clerk&#x27;s office in the municipality in which they serve. As mandated by Executive Law, Section 845 (Chapter 482, Laws of 1979 and Chapter 843 Laws of 1980), they are also listed with the Central Registry of Police and Peace Officers at the New York State, Division of Criminal Justice Services, Office of Public Safety in Albany, NY.

Their duties are as follows:

*To regulate traffic at emergency scenes. - In order to protect firefighters from outside interference, each New York State fire police detachment regulates traffic at the scene of any emergency to which its respective department has been called until relieved by the arrival of a fire chief or the regular police agency. 
*To protect the general public at the scene of a fire. - Residents, owners, occupants, relatives, transients, spectators, and even the news media may hamper firefighting operations; therefore, New York State fire police use tact and courtesy to prevent them from being harmed or obstructing firefighting operations.
*To keep fire areas clear for fire fighting purpose. - New York State fire police provide room for apparatus, emergency vehicles, service vehicles, and firefighters&#x27; vehicles to, among other things, park, operate, turn around, perform tanker operations, and lay hose lines for firefighters. 
*To protect the equipment of a fire company. - New York State fire police keep all non-firefighters away from (and especially off) department vehicles and equipment in order to prevent damage and looting.
*To enforce the laws of New York State relating to firematic activities and firefighting techniques. - The reckless disregard for safe driving within an emergency area, driving over fire hoses, spectators&#x27; disrespect for fire lines, and non-emergency vehicles intrusions, comprise just some of the situations that New York fire police must prevent.
*To cooperate with all regular police agencies. - Owing to their common causes of protection, safety, and order, New York fire police cooperate with regular police agencies. 
*To protect the property at the scene of a fire until the chief releases the fire police from duty and turns the responsibility over to other police agencies or to the owner.
*To preserve the crime scene until the proper authority arrives on the scene. - Although New York fire police prevent unauthorized entry into the scene, they remain alert to the fact that bystanders may possess critical information. In addition, they protect the scene&#x27;s evidence and report unusual events or happenings.
*To carry out the orders of the chief who is in supreme command at all fires and emergencies.

====North Carolina====
Uniformed regular and volunteer firemen and uniformed regular and volunteer members of a rescue squad in North Carolina may direct traffic and enforce traffic laws and ordinances at the scene of or in connection with fires, accidents, or other hazards in connection with their duties as firemen or rescue squad members. These members are not, however, considered law enforcement officers.

====Pennsylvania====
Fire police in Pennsylvania are volunteer fire company members and are sworn in by the mayor, borough council president, township supervisor, or the local district justice of the peace. While they are usually under the direct control of the local police, they are under the Pennsylvania State Police if no local department is available. The first fire police officers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were appointed in Meadville, Crawford County in 1896 and until the passage of Title 35 in 1941, had no greater authority than that which could be provided by their respective fire company and municipality.

However, the passage of the aforementioned bill granted Pennsylvania&#x27;s special fire police officers the police power to provide protection. In addition, fire police were legally created to assist their fire department during emergency situations. Moreover, Title 35 was amended in 1949, 1959, and again in 1980 (Act 74, 388, 209, 122) to broaden the scope of authority of the fire police. In 1949, the law was amended (Act 388) to give fire police the power to act without fire company involvement if requested to do so by their municipality. In 1959, (Act 209) the law was again amended to allow fire police to use their police powers in any non-emergency public function conducted by or under the auspices of any volunteer fire company and the requirement of the request of the municipality was later removed from the law.

Furthermore, the provision that allows fire police to use their police power in non-emergency events was later amended to authorize these officers to provide police services for organizations other than volunteer fire companies if requested to do so by their respective municipality. In 1980 (Act 122 - current law), the Fire Police Act was amended to, among other things, make it clear that the act does not (in and of itself) grant fire police officers the right or power to use firearms or other weapons. Conversely, nothing in the law prohibits Pennsylvania Fire Police, with a permit to carry a weapon, from carrying such while performing their duties.

In conclusion, these amendments widened the scope of authority of fire police in Pennsylvania to have limited police powers, and although they have no authority to make arrests, they do have the right to detain someone within reason.

Fire police may control the flow of traffic to ensure emergency vehicles have a quick, safe entrance and egress to an incident. They may halt traffic or detour traffic because of the situation and the dangers involved. They take orders from the police authority in charge. 
All fire police officers are sworn officers of the law and when on duty shall display a badge of authority and shall be subject to control of the chief of police of the city, borough, town or township in which they are serving, or if none, of a member of the Pennsylvania state police. Disobeying a fire police officer is the same as disobeying a police officer, sheriff&#x27;s deputy, state constable or state trooper and assaulting one is a felony.

Current Pennsylvania fire police law is found in Title 35, Chapter 74, subchapters 7431 to 7437.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, Vietnam Fire and Rescue Police Department (FRPD) is under command of Ministry of Public Security.

=== Germany ===
During the Third Reich the &quot;Feuerschutzpolizei&quot; (lit. &#x27;Fire Protection Police&#x27;) was a national firefighter unit formed by former municipal career fire departments and a part of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;. Every career firefighter was a police officer. In 1945 the fire departments came under municipal administration again, strictly separated from police jurisdictions.

<text>The European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal was a military award of the United States Armed Forces which was first created on November 6, 1942, by issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The medal was intended to recognize those military service members who had performed military duty in the European Theater (to include North Africa and the Middle East) during the years of the Second World War.

==History==
The EAME Campaign Medal was initially established by Executive Order 9265, dated 6 November 1942, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and announced in War Department Bulletin 56, 1942. The European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal was awarded as a service ribbon throughout the entire Second World War due to the ribbon design being approved by the Secretary of War in December 1942.

The medal design was submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts on 17 September 1946 and the first sample was completed in July 1947. The first recipient of the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal was General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower on 24 July 1947 in recognition of his service as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II.

The criteria were initially announced in Department of the Army (DA) Circular 84, dated 25 March 1948, and subsequently published in Army Regulation 600–65, dated 22 September 1948.
The Pacific Theater counterpart to the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal was the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal.

==Criteria==
Originally known as the &quot;EAME Ribbon&quot;, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal is awarded for any service performed between December 7, 1941, and March 2, 1946, inclusive, provided such service was performed in the following geographical theater areas: West boundary. -- From the North Pole, south along the 75th meridian west longitude to the 77th parallel north latitude, thence southeast through Davis Strait to the intersection of the 40th parallel north latitude and the 35th meridian west longitude, thence south along that meridian to the 10th parallel north latitude, thence southeast to the intersection of the equator and the 20th meridian west longitude, thence along the 20th meridian west longitude to the South Pole. East boundary—From the North Pole, south along the 60th meridian east longitude to its intersection with the eastern border of Iran, thence south along that border to the Gulf of Oman and the intersection of the 60th meridian east longitude, thence south along the 60th meridian east longitude to the South Pole.

==Appearance==

The medal&#x27;s obverse was designed by Mr. Thomas Hudson Jones based on General Eisenhower&#x27;s request that the medal include an invasion scene. The reverse side was designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman and is the same design as used on the reverse of the Asiatic–Pacific and American Campaign Medals.

The Bronze medal is in diameter. On the obverse is a LST landing craft and troops landing under fire with an airplane in the background below the words &quot;EUROPEAN AFRICAN MIDDLE EASTERN CAMPAIGN&quot;. On the reverse, an American bald eagle close between the dates &quot;1941 - 1945&quot; and the words &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot;.

The ribbon is wide and consists of the following stripes:
* Brown 67136 which represents the sands of Africa;
* each of Irish Green 67189, White 67101 and Scarlet 67111, representing Italy;
* Irish Green represents the green fields of Europe;
* each of Old Glory Blue 67178, White and Scarlet, taken from the American Defense Service Medal ribbon and refers to the continuance of American Defense after Pearl Harbor;
* Irish Green, again representing the green fields of Europe;
* each White, Black 67138, and White representing Germany; and lastly
* Brown, again representing the sands of Africa.

==Devices==
For those service members who participated in one or more designated military campaigns, campaign stars are authorized to be worn on the medal. The Arrowhead device is also authorized to be worn on the medal for those who participated in airborne or amphibious assault landings.

For those service members who saw combat but did not participate in a designated campaign, the following &quot;blanket campaigns&quot; are authorized to the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, denoted by campaign stars.

* Antisubmarine 7 Dec 41 - 8 May 1945
* Ground Combat 7 Dec 41 - 8 May 1945
* Air Combat: 7 Dec 41 - 8 May 1945

<doc id="945169" wikidata="Q604202" url="?curid=945169" title="Galactica 1980">
<text>Galactica 1980 is an American science fiction television series and a spin-off from the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; television series. It was first broadcast on ABC in the United States from January 27 to May 4, 1980, lasting for 10 episodes.

==Overview==
==Development==

A massive write-in campaign began upon the cancellation of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Because letter writing campaigns in favor of restoring cancelled television programs were uncommon in 1979, it prompted ABC to re-think their reasons for canceling the show. After some deliberation, they contacted Glen A. Larson to see about reviving the series, albeit in some modified and less expensive format.

Both Larson and the network felt the show needed some major change of focus to relaunch it as a spin-off, and Larson and Donald P. Bellisario decided to set the new series five years after &quot;The Hand of God&quot;, the final episode of the original series. This would allow them to weed out many supporting characters who were now considered superfluous, including Colonel Tigh and Cassiopeia, which would bring down production costs. The only major characters to return from the original series would be Commander Adama, Colonel Boomer (replacing Tigh), Apollo, Starbuck and Lord Baltar. Baltar was to have made atonement for betraying the Colonies to the Cylons, and was now the President of the Council of Twelve.

Upon discovering a &quot;present-day&quot; Earth completely unable to defend itself from the Cylons, Adama decided to just head off into deep space to lead the Cylons away from the planet, but Baltar suggested using time travel technology to alter Earth&#x27;s history so its technology would develop more rapidly up to a Colonial level. The Council votes this suggestion down, so Baltar steals a ship capable of time-travel and heads into Earth&#x27;s past to carry out his plan anyway. After some deliberation, Starbuck and Apollo are sent after him to bring him back or at least undo his changes to history. Episodes would feature a new &quot;Time Mission&quot; every week, generally with Apollo at some different time in the past, and Starbuck flying back and forth between &quot;Now&quot; and &quot;Then&quot; to give information and support to Apollo. ABC approved this pitch, and gave the approval to develop a pilot for the series.

However, Dirk Benedict (Starbuck in the original series) was unavailable at the time of filming. Richard Hatch (Apollo in the original series) was sent a script for &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;, but turned it down since he wasn&#x27;t sure what his part in the series would be now that all the characters had changed. It was then decided the series would take place thirty years after the end of the original series, and that Boxey would be renamed Troy and take Apollo&#x27;s role, while a character named Lt. Dillon would take over the Starbuck part. President Baltar was written out entirely, and Commander Xavier or Doctor Xavier was created to take up his role as the villain. The premise of setting the series thirty years after the original series created a plot hole in that the original series ended with a video transmission being picked up by the &quot;Galactica&quot; from the Apollo Moon landing, meaning that the original series would have to have taken place sometime after 1969 by Earth&#x27;s calendar. A thirty-year journey would mean that the Colonial Fleet could not have possibly reached Earth until the turn of the 21st Century rather than in 1980.

After the pilot was completed, the network was unhappy with the time travel aspects of the story, which was intended to be an ongoing premise in each episode as the Colonials chased Xavier through different periods in Earth&#x27;s history. They agreed to pick up the series only if the time-travel element was dropped. Larson and Bellisario reluctantly agreed, and the series instead became focused on Troy&#x27;s and Dillon&#x27;s attempts to protect some Colonial children on Earth.

==Synopsis==
Set during the year 1980, and a generation after the original series, the &quot;Galactica&quot; and its fleet of 220 civilian ships have finally discovered Earth, only to find that its people are not as scientifically advanced and that the planet can neither defend itself against the Cylons nor help the &quot;Galactica&quot; as originally hoped. Therefore, teams of Colonial warriors are covertly sent to the planet to work incognito with various members of the scientific community, hoping to advance Earth&#x27;s technology.

Commander Adama on the advice of Doctor Zee, a teenage prodigy serving as Adama&#x27;s counsellor, sends Captain Troy, who is the adopted son of Adama&#x27;s own son Apollo, and Lieutenant Dillon to North America, where they become entangled with TV journalist Jamie Hamilton. After an initial time travel adventure to Nazi Germany in the 1940s (to stop rebel Galactican Commander Xavier, trying to change the future to improve Earth&#x27;s technology level), the three friends devise ways to help Earth&#x27;s scientists and outwit the Cylons in the present day. Meanwhile, Adama sends a group of children from the &quot;Galactica&quot; fleet (the &quot;Super Scouts&quot;) to Earth in order to begin the process of integrating with the population. However, due to differences in gravity and physiology, the children must deal with the fact they have nearly super-human powers on Earth.

The tenth and final episode, &quot;The Return of Starbuck,&quot; uses the 1980 setting as a framing device for a story regarding Starbuck on a deserted planet.

The fates of several characters from the original series are explained during the course of the series. Apollo is apparently dead (or retired), the cause of his seeming disappearance not addressed. Starbuck was marooned on a desert planet, although the script for an unfilmed episode &quot;The Wheel of Fire&quot; indicated that Starbuck was eventually rescued from the planet by the inhabitants of the &quot;Ships of Light&quot; and became one of their inhabitants. Captain Troy is revealed to be Boxey, and Lt. Boomer has risen to the rank of Colonel and has become Adama&#x27;s second in command. The fates of several other characters, including Adama&#x27;s daughter Lieutenant Athena, Colonel Tigh, Lieutenant Sheba, Starbuck&#x27;s girlfriend Cassiopeia, and Muffit the daggit (robot dog) are not revealed. These characters are absent from the second series, however several &quot;other&quot; daggits are seen playing with children on one of the Colonial ships during the opening scenes of the series&#x27; first episode.

==Recurring cast==
* Lorne Greene as Commander Adama
* Herb Jefferson Jr. as Colonel Boomer
* Kent McCord as Captain Troy (known as Boxey in original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series)
* Barry Van Dyke as Lieutenant Dillon
* Robyn Douglass as Jamie Hamilton
* Jeremy Brett and Richard Lynch as Commander Xaviar
* Allan Miller as Colonel Jack Sydell
* Robbie Rist and James Patrick Stuart as Dr. Zee

==Cancellation==

The program was poorly received during its run, both due to plot elements as well as the series time slot. Within the plot, Commander Adama is now shown as a very weak leader, often at a loss as to how to proceed and frequently turning to Dr. Zee for advice. Zee in turn, who is a young teen boy, at times even gives Adama direct orders and appears to actually be the one in charge. The casting for Dillon and Troy was also a detriment to the show, since the characters were clearly intended to be &quot;look-alikes&quot; to Starbuck and Apollo, with many of the scripts even written for these original characters. This use of look-alike characters was similar to the casting of Coy and Vance Duke in the series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, which caused problems for that show as well.

The series also suffered low ratings because the show was aired at a time slot otherwise reserved for either child-friendly-based, informational, educational, or news-related programming (Sunday, 7:00 PM/6:00 PM Central), and was cancelled after ten episodes, many of which were multi-part stories. The final episode shown was &quot;The Return of Starbuck&quot;, which featured a guest appearance by Dirk Benedict from the original series. Larson even began to develop a sequel to this episode, but the series was cancelled during production of episode 11, &quot;The Day They Kidnapped Cleopatra&quot;, which remained unfinished.

==Syndication and beyond==

The ten &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; episodes were rolled into the television syndication package for &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and were given the same title as its parent program.

Following the program&#x27;s cancellation, a feature film titled &quot;Conquest of the Earth&quot; was stitched together from sections of the three &quot;Galactica Discovers Earth&quot; episodes and the two &quot;The Night the Cylons Landed&quot; episodes. A scene of John Colicos as Baltar was also spliced into this release. The latter footage was actually taken from an episode of the original series (Baltar makes no appearances in any &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; episodes) and is partially dubbed, so as to make the speech sound relevant to the &quot;Galactica&#x27;s&quot; new situation. Several early scenes involving Adama and Dr. Zee are also partially dubbed, to add more explanatory detail and to explain why two actors appear playing the role of Dr. Zee. The feature was released in cinemas in Europe, New Zealand and Australia and on home video elsewhere.

==Home media==
On December 23, 2007, Universal released all of the &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; episodes on DVD in a 2-disc set. This release is touted as &quot;The Original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;″s Final Season&quot;.

== Comic series ==

In August 2009, Dynamite Entertainment released a &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; comic series. It was written by Marc Guggenheim and is a re-imagining of the original series.

<doc id="945177" wikidata="Q2822254" url="?curid=945177" title="Michigan Military Academy">
<text>The Michigan Military Academy, also known as M.M.A., was an all-boys military prep school in Orchard Lake Village, Oakland County, Michigan. It was founded in 1877 by J. Sumner Rogers and closed in 1908 due to bankruptcy. Some journalists have referred to the school as the &quot;Second West Point.&quot; The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as the Orchard Lake Schools Historic District.

==Early history and establishment==
In 1858, Joseph Tarr Copeland, a U.S. Army general who would later serve in the American Civil War, purchased several acres of land and began to build his retirement home on the shores of Orchard Lake. Most of the 90 acres (364,000 m2) he owned were used for agricultural purposes, and he was slowly selling tracts of land for development. The area was popular with tourists, so in 1871 Copeland converted his residence, a large, castle-like home on the shores of Orchard Lake, into the Orchard Lake Hotel. Business was good for a few years but development in the area forced many vacationers to seek seclusion farther north and the Panic of 1873 forced Copeland to find profit elsewhere. In 1877 Copeland sought to sell his home and the land around it. J. Sumner Rogers, who was a professor of Military Science and Tactics at Detroit High School, had wanted to establish a creditable military prep school in the Detroit area for some time. Seeing the opportunity at hand, Rogers bought the land with the help of some wealthy Detroiters, and later that year he established the Michigan Military Academy. He modeled the academy after West Point and its success was immediate.

==Peak years==
Over the course of its 30-year history, Michigan Military Academy had 2,558 enrollments and 458 graduates. The graduating class of 1893 played a prominent role in the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and many of the classes won National Drill Competitions.

On June 19, 1879, William Tecumseh Sherman, General in Chief of the U.S. Army, delivered a variant of his famous &quot;War Is Hell&quot; speech to the graduating class. A total of 10,000 people arrived to listen to Sherman&#x27;s speech, and the press reported that it was the largest number of people ever to gather within the township&#x27;s boundaries (at that time the village of Orchard Lake was part of West Bloomfield Township). Some claim that he said: &quot;There is many a boy here today who looks upon war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell&quot;; however, the published text of Sherman&#x27;s address does not contain that line.

Future City of Detroit Mayor, Cadet John C. Lodge, recorded his memories of the Sherman speech, &quot;At one of our graduation exercises the speaker was General William T. Sherman. He was not eloquent, and he didn&#x27;t have a very pleasant voice; it was somewhat shrill.&quot;

==Student life==
With a tuition of $500 per year in the 1800s (about $16,000 in 2022), M.M.A. attracted mostly sons of wealthy upper class businessmen. There were three levels of training at the school: Infantry, Artillery, and Cavalry. The cadets wore gray and white uniforms, modeled after those that were worn at West Point. Students with musical abilities were encouraged to join the marching band. All cadets were taught to use a .45 caliber Springfield rifle, and the academy had an 8-inch siege mortar and Gatling guns at its disposal for military drills. There were a few accidents; in 1884, a cadet drowned during a training exercise in the lake. In 1889, another cadet drowned during a midnight swim.

The cadets had a busy schedule, even on weekends. Rogers and his staff allowed for holiday parties and arranged dances with nearby all-girls schools. Discipline was harsh and there were many athletic and extracurricular activities and the students were encouraged to participate. There were several hundred dropouts throughout the academy&#x27;s history.

==Campus==
There were a total of 19 buildings on the campus. The oldest building on the campus is Copeland&#x27;s &quot;castle&quot;, built in 1858, and it is still in use. The Academic Building (pictured above) was completed in 1890 and it was the center of academic life on campus. Additional buildings, include a Riding Hall (1881), Cadets Barracks (1884), Engine House (1889), Gymnasium (1896). There were also several barns, and these and many other buildings were demolished, replaced, or destroyed by fire throughout the academy&#x27;s short history.

As Rogers extended the campus, he dug a network of tunnels to connect most of the buildings. In the event of an attack, the tunnels would provide easy access across campus. The tunnels also led to a large bomb shelter under the Engine House. The tunnels are now used for plumbing, electricity, ethernet, and other utilities.

==Bankruptcy and post-peak years==
In 1900, Rogers undertook a massive building project, with a total of nine buildings planned at a cost of $350,000 (about $13 million in 2022). In December of that year, students and teachers protested against mistreatment and unsatisfactory meals. Rogers, who was terminally ill at the time, quickly fired several teachers whom he blamed for instigating the complaints. Rogers died in September 1901 and management of the school was left to Rogers&#x27; widowed wife and his friend Gen. Charles King. Enrollment declined sharply, and the academy sank into debt and then bankruptcy before being closed in 1908.

The seminary has stayed there to this day. It is now called SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary. The campus is also home to St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory, and Madonna University of Livonia, Michigan holds some classes on the campus.

<text>Mariusz Zbigniew Pudzianowski (; born 7 February 1977), also known as &quot;Pudzian&quot; and &quot;Dominator&quot;, is a Polish mixed martial artist and former strongman competitor. With 43 international victories at a record 70% winning percentage and over 20 world records in his strongman career, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest strength athletes of all time.

During his career as a strongman, Pudzianowski won five World&#x27;s Strongest Man titles, the most in history. He also won two runner-up titles in 2006 and 2009 and made 9 out of 9 appearances into the World&#x27;s Strongest Man final (a feat replicated only by Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson since then). He also won the Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man a record 6 times.

In 2009, Pudzianowski started his career as a mixed martial artist.

==Early years==
Mariusz Pudzianowski was born in Biała Rawska, Poland. His father, Wojciech, was a weightlifter. Pudzianowski quickly became interested in sports. Since the age of 11, he has been training the Kyokushin style of karate. His current grade is 4th kyu green belt. He began strength training at the age of thirteen. When he was fifteen, Pudzianowski also started training boxing, quitting after seven years. Pudzianowski debuted in professional sports at the age of sixteen, taking part in Polish Weightlifting Championship, in the bench press event.

===Imprisonment===
In 2000 and 2001, Pudzianowski spent 19 months in Łowicz prison for assault. In an interview, he said he wanted to stop a &quot;local mafia boss&quot;, and he got accused of assault and stealing his golden chain. Pudzianowski was incarcerated in prison in Łowicz. Several years later he arranged a resocialization meeting for the prisoners at the same penal institution.

==Strongman career==

On 1 May 1999 Pudzianowski entered his first Strongman competition, held in Płock, Poland. He achieved his first major success at the international level at the 2000 World&#x27;s Strongest Man contest where he finished fourth in his first WSM competition. Due to his prison sentence, he did not return for the 2001 competition.

Pudzianowski returned at the 2002 World&#x27;s Strongest Man and won his first title. He retained his title at the 2003 World&#x27;s Strongest Man with an event to spare, winning by the largest margin ever achieved in the competition; across the seven disciplines in the final, he scored a remarkable four first place finishes, two second place finishes and one third place finish, resulting in the points margin between first and second (20) being greater than the margin between second and ninth (18). British strongman Laurence Shahlaei has since called this performance the most dominant victory ever seen at a World&#x27;s Strongest Man event. In March 2004, he also became the Strongman Super Series World Champion.

He initially finished third in the 2004 World&#x27;s Strongest Man but was later disqualified for breaching the governing body&#x27;s Strongman Health Policy. He was forced to return his prize money, stripped of the International Federation of Strength Athletes points from the event, and received a one-year ban from competition. Pudzianowski did not dispute his banned substance violation and waived his right to have his stool sample verified.

In 2005, he made his return to World&#x27;s Strongest Man event. After a slow start in the final&#x27;s first two events, after which he found himself 7 points behind the leader in seventh place, he proceeded to dominate the rest of the event with five first place finishes in a row in the final five disciplines, winning the title with an event to spare.

In the 2006 World&#x27;s Strongest Man contest, despite starting the final well, he eventually came second to Phil Pfister after the American won the final five events in a row. Pudzianowski regained his title in 2007, winning the final with one event to spare for a record-breaking third time. In so doing, he joined Jon Pall Sigmarsson and Magnus Ver Magnusson as the only men to win the competition four times. During the 2007 competition, however, Pudzianowski said that his target was to become the only person to win the event five times, and he returned to the 2008 World&#x27;s Strongest Man the following year to try to achieve his goal.

Despite a serious calf injury suffered in the Polish Strongman Championship Cup of 2008 and further exacerbated during the WSM qualifying rounds, Pudzianowski still managed to win his heat and qualify for the final. However, it was clear his dominance of previous years was no longer in effect, as he only won one of the first five events in the final, and finished in fifth in two others. Trailing leader Derek Poundstone with two events to go, Pudzianowski managed to win the Plane Pull despite his injured calf to cut the deficit to just 1 point going into the final event. Matched up against Poundstone in the Atlas Stones in a &#x27;winner-take-all&#x27; scenario, Pudzianowski managed to beat his American rival by the narrowest of margins to become the first and still only man to win five World&#x27;s Strongest Man titles.

He competed in the 2009 World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition the following year in Malta, trying to win a remarkable sixth title in 8 years. He eventually placed second after Žydrūnas Savickas returned to the competition to win the title for the first time. Following the competition, Pudzianowski said in an interview that he would not continue participating in strongman events, because of his career in Mixed Martial Arts, which required totally different training to strongman.

==Mixed martial arts==
In 2009, Pudzianowski signed a contract with Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki – a Polish mixed martial arts organization – to take part in four fights.

He debuted as a mixed martial arts fighter on 11 December 2009, during the KSW 12 event in Warsaw, Poland, winning against Marcin Najman. Pudzianowski started throwing low kicks soon after the fight began. After several hits, Najman fell to the mat and Pudzianowski started delivering punches (a tactic known as ground-and-pound). Najman was forced to tap the mat, indicating he wanted to end the fight, which lasted for only 43 seconds. Pudzianowski collected 200,000 zlotys (US$70,000) for the fight.

On 7 May 2010, during the KSW 13 event, Pudzianowski won his second fight, against Yusuke Kawaguchi. The fight lasted two full rounds, with Pudzianowski winning by judges&#x27; decision. The fight was described as a &quot;sloppy brawl&quot;. It was noted Pudzianowski had control over most of the fight, but was &quot;neutralized&quot; by Kawaguchi, and that, by the second round, he was looking &quot;to be out of energy and breathing heavily&quot;.

On 21 May 2010, Pudzianowski went on to participate in the &quot;Moosin: God of Martial Arts&quot; event, where he fought former two time UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia. Pudzianowski fractured his metatarsus during the first round and then went on to deplete his stamina during the rest of the fight, which ultimately led to Sylvia defeating him via submission at 1:43 of round 2.

Following his loss to Sylvia in May, Pudzianowski signed to face former heavyweight boxer and kickboxer Eric Esch, better known as &#x27;Butterbean&#x27;, at KSW 14 on 18 September. After several brief standup exchanges, Pudzianowski secured a takedown early in the fight and was then able to dominate Esch with ground and pound. Esch, unable to get back to his feet during the attack, tapped out to the strikes, making Pudzianowski the winner by submission at 1:15 of the first round. He came into the fight notably slimmer, having lost around 20 lbs from his previous fight. Many believe his large muscle mass to have caused his stamina problems in his earlier fights.

On 21 May 2011 Pudzianowski fought James Thompson at KSW 16, losing by arm triangle.

In September 2011 Mariusz Pudzianowski started professional training in the well known MMA camp in the USA – American Top Team.

Pudzianowski fought on the KSW 17 event, which was held on 26 November 2011. He faced James Thompson in a rematch. He won the fight via majority decision. This decision caused controversy as Thompson had virtually full control in both rounds, and after the fight Thompson, who was clearly angered by the decision, took the microphone from the announcer and launched a verbal assault directed at the promotion in which he ranted: &quot;F...g joke. Give Mariusz a big round of applause. Come on. What a f...g joke. I thought KSW was really trying to be serious. If you can watch that back and call that serious, then (looking at the promoter) you&#x27;re f...d, and KSW is going down the f...g toilet.&quot; Two days later the promotion changed the result to a No Contest. During a conference held on 28 November, the ruling was deemed to be a &quot;judge&#x27;s error&quot; and the fight result was changed.

Mariusz&#x27;s next opponent was Bob Sapp in a fight took place in Łódź, Poland on KSW 19 on 12 May 2012. Mariusz won via a TKO in the first round, battering Sapp with a barrage of punching and securing a takedown followed with more punches to win just 39 seconds into the fight.

Mariusz then faced Christos Piliafas on 15 September in the main event of KSW 20. Mariusz won via TKO in the first round, after dominating Piliafas on his feet, he then secured a takedown followed by posturing up and raining down some ground and pound to win at 3:48 seconds into the fight.

On 8 June 2013, Pudzianowski fought Sean McCorkle at KSW 23, losing the bout in the first round by kimura submission. Pudzianowski fought McCorkle again in a rematch on 28 September at KSW 24, avenging his loss via unanimous decision. After the second fight, Sean McCorkle expressed interest in a third fight.

On 17 May 2014 at KSW 27, Pudzianowski defeated Oli Thompson via a 2nd round unanimous decision. During the fight, Pudzianowski was able to gain points by controlling the entire fight through landing punches and securing multiple takedowns in both rounds eventually leading to his victory. At the end, Thompson requested a rematch, to which Pudzianowski agreed.

On 6 December 2014, Pudzianowski defeated the olympic veteran Paweł Nastula via unanimous decision on KSW 29&#x27;s co-main event. It was his third win in a row.

Pudzianowski next fought Rolles Gracie Jr. in KSW 31, on 23 May 2015 in Gdańsk, Poland. He defeated Gracie Jr. via knockout in the 1st round, winning the &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; bonus award with the performance.

At KSW 32 on 31 October 2015, Pudzianowski lost to Peter Graham via TKO in the second round.

Then on 27 May 2016 at KSW 35 against Marcin Różalski, he lost also in the second round this time by guillotine choke.

In his next fight in KSW 37 on 3 December 2016 Pudzianowski defeated Paweł Mikołajuw with TKO in the first round.

On 27 May 2017 at KSW 39 Pudzianowski defeated Tyberiusz Kowalczyk via submission to elbow strike in the second round.

Pudzianowski was expected to face James McSweeney at KSW 40 on 22 October 2017. However, after McSweeney was medically cleared, he eventually faced Jay Silva and won by majority decision.

Mariusz faced Karol Bedorf on 9 June 2018 at KSW 44: The Game. He lost the bout via first round kimura.

Mariusz faced Szymon Kołecki in a heavyweight bout at KSW 47 on 23 March 2019. Pudzianowski lost the fight after suffering a leg injury in the first round.

=== Winning streak ===
Next, Pudzian faced former bodybuilder Erko Jun on 9 November 2019 at KSW 51: Croatia. He won the bout via second round TKO.

Pudzianowski was then scheduled to headline KSW 53 against Quentin Domingos on 21 March 2020 before the bout was scrapped due to Pudzianowski&#x27;s injury.

Pudzianowski was set to return after a fifteen month layoff against the undefeated Senegalese heavyweight Serigne Ousmane at KSW 59: Fight Code on 20 March 2021. However, on the day of the fight, Ousmane Dia suffered an acute appendicitis attack and had to be hospitalized. Stepping in on just a few hours notice was Serbia&#x27;s Nikola Milanovic. Pudzianowski won the bout via TKO in the first round.

Pudzianowski faced KSW 1 tournament winner Łukasz Jurkowski on 5 June 2021 at KSW 63: Crime of The Century. Pudzianowski won the fight via TKO in the 3rd round.

The fight with Serigne Ousmane Dia was then rebooked and took place at KSW 64: Przybysz vs. Santos on 23 October 2021. Pudzianowski won the fight via knockout 18 seconds into round one.

Pudzianowski faced former KSW Middleweight champion Michał Materla at KSW 70: Pudzianowski vs. Materla on 28 May 2022. He won the bout in the first round, knocking out Materla with an uppercut. He was awarded the &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; bonus with the win.

Pudzianowski faced former two-division champion Mamed Khalidov at KSW 77: Khalidov vs. Pudzianowski on 17 December 2022. Pudzian&#x27;s 6-win streak was ended after he tapped to ground and pound in the first round.

==Outside professional sports==
===Education===
On 27 May 2008 Pudzianowski graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in international relations. His thesis was: &quot;Organizational culture in sports marketing in the world&quot;.

===Business===
In an interview in 2009 Mariusz said that he treats the sport as a hobby. He is not doing it for money, as the money is relatively low in Strongman and MMA (he said that the winner of World&#x27;s Strongest Man can get US$60,000, and the winner of Grand Prix in the US can get anywhere from US$100,000 to $150,000). He owns a school for bodyguards as well as real estate. Those are his main sources of money. Pudzianowski also owns a truck cargo company named Pudzianowski Transport.

===Musical career===
Pudzianowski often appears as a guest singer in the musical group Pudzian Band, formed by his brother Krystian. Their first single &quot;Zdobyć świat&quot;, was released in 2006. In 2009, the group released an album, &quot;Dawaj na ring&quot; (&quot;Go, hit the ring&quot;).

===Celebrity status===
In 2008, Pudzianowski took part in the 7th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in his native Poland. He advanced to the final episode, but ultimately finished second, losing to actress Magdalena Walach. Pudzianowski was a contestant in the 1st season of the singing reality show &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; in Poland. He was coupled with former Ich Troje singer Anna Wiśniewska.

===Rugby===

Pudzianowski is also a keen amateur rugby union player, and plays with Blachy Pruszyński Budowlani Łódź.

===Strongman diet===

Pudzianowski is liberal with his diet and is often seen eating chocolate, ice cream or burgers. On one of the World Strongman events shown on TV, and an interview for MTV, when asked about his diet he said: &quot;I eat everything. I do not follow any particular diet. I eat anything I want, anytime I want&quot;.

He said for MTV that he prefers Polish cuisine. When he has some time he often cooks himself, as he does not particularly fancy meals from restaurants. He often eats bigos, Polish soups, Polish sausages and typical Polish dinners with cooked potatoes, 200–300 g of meat and some salads (usually cucumber salad).

In an interview at the beginning of his world strongman career he said that his supplements, training, massages, etc. costs him approximately 6000 złoty (c. U.S. $2,000) per month.

==Commercials==
* &quot;Dominator&quot; – an energy drink using Pudzianowski&#x27;s profile is being distributed in Poland.
* Mariusz appeared in a Met-rx commercial which aired during the U.S. broadcast of the 2007 World&#x27;s Strongest Man contest.

<doc id="945201" wikidata="Q141929" url="?curid=945201" title="Vanuatu at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Vanuatu competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, which was held from 13 to 29 August 2004. The nation&#x27;s appearance at the 2004 Athens Games marked its fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Two track and field athletes, Moses Kamut and Katura Marae, were selected to represent the nation via wildcards, as the nation had no athletes that met either the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; qualifying standards. Kamut was selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Marae was notable for being the youngest competitor in Athletics for this Summer Olympics, and for being the youngest ever athlete to represent Vanuatu at the Olympics, aged 14 years and 261 days. The latter is a record which still stands today.

Neither of the two athletes progressed beyond the heats, both of whom finishing last in their heats, therefore meaning that Vanuatu won no medals in this Summer Olympics. Despite this, Kamut and Marae both achieved seasonal best times for their events, the 400 meters and the 100 meters respectively.

==Background==
Vanuatu participated in five Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Vanuatu would participate in the Summer Olympics from 13 to 29 August 2004. No Vanuatu athlete had ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics before the 2004 Athens Games.

The Vanuatu National Olympic Committee (NOC) selected two athletes via wildcards. Usually a NOC would be able to select up to three athletes per event providing that each athlete passed the &quot;A&quot; standard time for that event. If no athletes met the &quot;A&quot; standard, then the NOC would be able to select one athlete for the event, providing that they pass the &quot;B&quot; standard time for the event in question. However, since Vanuatu had no athletes that met either standard for any event, they were allowed to select their best two athletes, one of each gender, to represent the nation at the Games. This was to make sure that every nation had a minimum of two representatives in the Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Athens games were Moses Kamut in the Men&#x27;s 400 meters and Katura Marae in the Women&#x27;s 100 meters.
Along with the two athletes, the Vanuatu Olympic team consisted of Chef De Mission Michel Mainguy, VASANOC President Joe Bomal Carlo, and VASANOC Secretary General, Seru Korikalo. Ancel Nalau, who represented Vanuatu at the 1992 Summer Olympics in the Men&#x27;s 1500 meters, coached Kamut and Marae for the Athens Games. Kamut was selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

==Athletics ==

Making his Summer Olympics debut, Moses Kamut was notable for carrying the Vanuatu flag at the opening ceremony. He qualified for the Athens Games via a wildcard place as his best time, 48.36 seconds at the 2004 Oceania Athletics Championships Men&#x27;s 400 meters, was 2.41 seconds slower than the &quot;B&quot; qualifying standard required. He competed on 20 August in Heat 7 against seven other athletes. He ran a time of 48.14 seconds, finishing last despite achieving a seasonal best time. Pakistan&#x27;s Sajid Muhammad ranked ahead of him (47.45 seconds) in a heat led by Jamaica&#x27;s Michael Blackwood (45.23 seconds). Overall, Kamut placed 52 out of 63 athletes competing and was 2.26 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-finals. Therefore, that was the end of his competition. 
Competing at her first Summer Olympics, Katura Marae was the youngest athlete in the 2004 Athens Games athletics and the youngest ever athlete to represent the nation aged 14 years and 261 days, the latter a record that still stands today. She qualified for the Athens Games after being granted a wildcard place, without competing in any notable sporting event. She competed on 20 August in the Women&#x27;s 100 meters in Heat 1. She posted a time of 13.49 seconds, achieving a seasonal best time, but still finishing last of the 8 athletes that competed in the heat. Cambodia&#x27;s Tit Linda Sou placed ahead of her (13.47 seconds) in a heat led by Jamaica&#x27;s Aleen Bailey (11.20 seconds). Overall, Marae was 2.06 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed, therefore not advancing to the quarter-finals.

<text>The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions (subtitled The Official Story of the Abbey Road Years 1962–1970) is a 1988 reference book on the English rock band the Beatles written by Mark Lewisohn. It was published by Hamlyn in the UK and by Harmony Books in the US.

The book is written in the form of a diary, documenting each day from 1962 through 1970 that the Beatles spent in a recording session or producers and engineers spent mixing and editing their music. The book has been widely described as an &quot;essential&quot; reference book for study of the band.

== Background ==
In the early 1980s, John Barrett, a balance engineer employed by EMI, found himself unoccupied while undergoing chemotherapy. Ken Townsend, the General Manager of Abbey Road Studios, later recalled suggesting Barrett keep his mind engaged by listening to the Beatles&#x27; session tapes and write down information pertaining to them. Author Stephen Matteo alternatively suggests Barrett&#x27;s work was intended to gather interesting unreleased material for &quot;The Beatles at Abbey Road&quot;, a 1983 multimedia presentation at Abbey Road Studios. Barrett produced a colour-coded catalogue, which Townsend later said displayed an &quot;incredible&quot; attention to detail. In 1982, while attending Liverpool&#x27;s annual Beatles convention, Townsend, Barrett and author Brian Southall used Barrett&#x27;s work during a Q&amp;A session. Attendees were enthusiastic about the new information and suggested the catalogue be published, but Barrett&#x27;s death in 1984 precluded it. The project was nearly abandoned until Abbey Road employee Kathryn Varley pushed for its completion.

Mark Lewisohn began formally researching the Beatles in the late 1970s, working as a research assistant for Philip Norman&#x27;s book &quot;Shout!&quot; (1981). In 1986, Lewisohn published his first reference book, &quot;The Beatles Live!&quot;, a chronological guide of the group&#x27;s live performances. The book took years to research and compiles over 1,000 primary sources to provide an exhaustive guide.

Because of his work compiling &quot;The Beatles Live!&quot;, EMI commissioned Lewisohn in 1987 to continue Barrett&#x27;s work and write a book detailing the Beatles&#x27; recording sessions. Besides Abbey Road Studios staffers and the Beatles, Lewisohn was the first person granted access to listen to all of the Beatles&#x27; working tapes, a privilege not extended again until 1995 for writer Mark Hertsgaard. Working from 1987 through 1988, the book took two years to research and write. Lewisohn consulted the studio&#x27;s recording paperwork, reproducing some of it in the book, and interviewed eighty people who were present at the sessions, including the Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin, publicist Derek Taylor and engineer Geoff Emerick. Besides Barrett&#x27;s previous research, the collection of Beatles recordings stored at Abbey Road Studios had never been properly archived. Listening to over four hundred hours of tapes, Lewisohn&#x27;s working process served the dual purpose of both researching the book as well as organising the collection, cataloguing its various mixes, submixes, mastertakes and outtakes.

== Publication and content ==

Hamlyn published &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot; in the UK in September1988. A book launch was held on 26September at Abbey Road Studios, with wax figures of the Beatles temporarily moved to the studio from London&#x27;s Madame Tussauds wax museum for the event. Harmony Books published it in the US the following month, re-titled as &quot;The Beatles Recording Sessions&quot;.

Spanning 204 pages, most of &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Session&quot; is written in the form of a diary detailing each day either the Beatles spent in a recording session or producers and engineers spent mixing and editing their music. The diary begins with the band&#x27;s first recording session at EMI Recording Studios on 6 June 1962, while drummer Pete Best was still in the band, and finishes on 8 May 1970 with the release of the album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. The book includes a one-page preface by Ken Townsend and a ten-page interview between Lewisohn and Paul McCartney.

Each entry first notes the date; the studio location, usually EMI or Apple Studios; the session time; the songs recorded or mixed, including the number of takes; and the names of the producer and engineers involved. Lewisohn then writes about the details of the particular session, such as overdubbing, false starts and studio chatter, as well as information about session musicians, orchestration and any other related information. He discusses the fate of various session tapes, the differences between mono and stereo mixes and the technical advancements first pioneered on the Beatles&#x27; recordings. UK release dates of singles, albums and EPs are also mentioned, discussing their chart success and sales numbers.

Following the diary entries, the book includes a complete discography of all the Beatles&#x27; UK and US releases, including singles, EPs and albums. It concludes with a glossary of recording industry terms and a note from Townsend on the recording technology used by the band.
== Impact and legacy ==

The book has been widely described as an &quot;essential&quot; Beatles reference book and required reading for anyone attempting a serious study of the band. In Michael Brocken and Melissa Davis&#x27;s guide to Beatles literature, &quot;The Beatles Bibliography&quot;, they describe it as &quot;one of the cornerstones of Beatles scholarship&quot;, and the authors Stuart Shea and Robert Rodriguez characterise it as &quot;[p]ossibly the most important Beatles book ever published&quot;, writing it was a &quot;landmark&quot; by providing the general public with so much previously unknown information.

Later writers have relied heavily on the book&#x27;s research. The critic Tim Riley writes the book is &quot;indispensable for close listening&quot;, and the authors Ian MacDonald and Mark Hertsgaard each described it as being indispensable for the research of their own books, &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot; (1994) and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; (1995), respectively. Hertsgaard writes it is &quot;superb, but superb in the way an encyclopedia is superb&quot;, contending that it provides much more than the typical reader would expect, leaving a book that &quot;focuses more on the trees than on the forest&quot;.

The authors Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Chris Ingham and Colin Fleming each praise the book as engrossing in its narrative of each particular recording session, though Fleming finds some of Lewisohn&#x27;s descriptions of songs lacking. Riley similarly criticises Lewisohn for writing more like a fan than a critic, with his descriptions reliant on adjectives like &quot;brilliant&quot; rather than evaluating a recording&#x27;s &quot;color, texture and mood&quot;. Writing in 2009 for &quot;The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles&quot;, John Kimsey wrote that the definitive″ [account]&quot; of the band&#x27;s recording history and studio practices has since been &quot;supplanted&quot; by Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;Recording the Beatles&quot;.

&quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot; was one of the first books to document a band or artist through their recording sessions. Similar works covering Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix were written following its release. In the introduction to his 1995 book on Dylan&#x27;s recording sessions, Clinton Heylin acknowledges that Lewisohn&#x27;s book remains &quot;perhaps the best-known &#x27;sessionography. David Hunter of the University of Texas at Austin describes the book as a &quot;bio-discography&quot; – a portmanteau of biography and discography – illustrating the Beatles&#x27; progression and story through study of their recorded music. He writes that it serves as &quot;the standard by which all bio-discographies will be measured&quot;. Lewisohn&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;The Complete Beatles Chronicle&quot;, combines the work of &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot; with &quot;The Beatles Live!&quot; to provide an exhaustive day-by-day account of the group.

<doc id="945203" wikidata="Q1920336" url="?curid=945203" title="Mendenhall Glacier">
<text>Mendenhall Glacier () is a glacier about long located in Mendenhall Valley, about from downtown Juneau in the southeast area of the U.S. state of Alaska. The glacier and surrounding landscape is protected as part of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area, a federally designated unit of the Tongass National Forest.

The Juneau Icefield Research Program has monitored the outlet glaciers of the Juneau Icefield since 1942, including Mendenhall Glacier. The glacier has also retreated since 1929, when Mendenhall Lake was created, and over since 1500. The end of the glacier currently has a negative glacier mass balance and will continue to retreat in the foreseeable future.

Given that average yearly temperatures are currently increasing, and the outlook is for this trend to continue, it is actually possible that the glacier might experience a period of stabilization or slight advance during its retreating march. This is because increasing amounts of warm, moist air will be carried up to the head of the icefield, where colder ambient temperatures will cause it to precipitate as snow. The increased amount of snow will feed the icefield, possibly enough to offset the continually increasing melting experienced at the glacier&#x27;s terminus. However, this interesting phenomenon will fade away if temperatures continue to climb, since the head of the glacier will no longer have cold enough ambient temperatures to cause snow to precipitate.

==Name==
It was originally known as Sitaantaago (&quot;the Glacier Behind the Town&quot;) or Aak&#x27;wtaaksit (&quot;the Glacier Behind the Little Lake&quot;), also Latinized as Aakwtaaksit, by the Tlingit. The glacier was named Auke (Auk) Glacier by naturalist John Muir for the Tlingit Auk Kwaan (or Aak&#x27;w Kwaan) band in 1879. In 1891 it was renamed in honor of Thomas Corwin Mendenhall. It extends from the Juneau Icefield, its source, to Mendenhall Lake.

==Flooding==
Since 2011, periodic glacial floods have occurred from the Suicide Basin into the lake and downstream Mendenhall River. A major release in 2023 destroyed two buildings.

==Retreat==

===Causes===
The glacier is retreating due to a generally warming climate in Southeast Alaska, linked to global warming driven by climate change. The US Forest Service, which manages the Mendenhall Glacier, says &quot;because glaciers are a product of climate, they respond to climate change.&quot; The Mendenhall Glacier has retreated approximately 2.5 miles since its most recent maxima during the Little Ice Age in the mid-1700s. In a joint article for the Juneau Empire Geologist Cathy Connor and Geophysicist Roman Motyka, both professors of the University of Alaska said &quot;climatic warming coupled with ice loss through iceberg calving are the reasons the Mendenhall Glacier is retreating and shrinking.&quot; It is expected the glacier face will soon pull out of the lake.

===Negative effects===

The retreat of the Mendenhall Glacier and other glaciers in the area is believed by some to be a result of broader retreat and breakup of the Juneau Icefield. The Juneau Icefield is the fifth largest icefield in North America. Many populations near glacial areas rely on the glaciers for fresh drinking water. Once these glaciers are gone these people will need another source. For example, Anchorage, the most populated city in Alaska and many people there rely on the Eklutna glacier for their freshwater. If the recession of this glacier continues they will be out of their main source of water.

===Benefits===

Although there are many negative effects of the recession of the Mendenhall Glacier and glaciers in general, there are also a few positive outcomes. With the retreat of the Mendenhall Glacier, the Mendenhall Lake has formed. The lake is a result of the run-off from the glacier and is increasing in size as the glacier continues to retreat. The lake began to form in 1929 and has continued to grow. The lake has a unique ecosystem and is a nursery for a variety of fish including several type of salmon, Dolly Varden, char, and cutthroat trout.

===Ancient forest uncovered===
In 2012, tree stumps and logs with attached roots and bark appeared under the retreating glacier. They are in their original growth position, preserved under what was believed to be a protective gravel layer. By uncovering them, scientists learn about the ecosystem from before the glacier formed. They can determine trees&#x27; ages when they died by looking at their preserved remains. One of the scientists, Cathy Conner, was reported as finding &quot;The most recent stumps emerging from the Mendenhall are between 1,400 and 1,200 years old. The oldest are around 2,350 years old. Some have dated around 1,870 to 2,000 years old.&quot;

==Visitor center==
The United States Forest Service operates the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center as part of the Tongass National Forest, offering interpretive programs throughout the year for children and adults. The Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center and surrounding area offer views of a lake-terminating, calving glacier.

This was the first U.S. Forest Service visitor center built in the nation; it was designed by Linn A. Forrest and dedicated in 1962. The building was expanded, renovated and rededicated in 1999.

The two small parking lots have access to several trails in the area. Photo Point Trail and the Steep Creek Trail are easy and accessible trails. Elevated boardwalks above Steep Creek provide salmon and bear viewing opportunities. Visitors can hike via the East Glacier Loop to an overlook within of the glacier. Two routes traverse a series of wooden steps and a gradual elevation gain of on this trail. The Trail of Time, which connects to East Glacier Loop, includes historical signs and handicapped accessibility. The Nugget Falls Trail leads visitors to Nugget Falls, closer to the face of the glacier. Access to the outside area and trails is free. The West Glacier trail offers access to the glacier itself and the chance to view ice caves beneath it. This trail is located across the lake from the Visitor Center.

In addition to the busy summer season, the center hosts the Fireside Lecture series on Friday evenings, January through March. Programs cover ecological and cultural history, and events in Southeast Alaska.

==Romeo the wolf==

Romeo was a wolf who lived around Mendenhall Glacier between 2003 and 2009 until he was killed by out-of-state poachers. The Visitor Center has an exhibit and taxidermy of Romeo&#x27;s pelt to commemorate him and the town&#x27;s love for him. Nick Jans&#x27; book, &quot;A Wolf Called Romeo&quot;, brings Romeo&#x27;s life to a broader audience.

<doc id="945206" wikidata="Q423842" url="?curid=945206" title="Methylsulfonylmethane">
<text>Dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH3)2SO2. It is also known by several other names including methyl sulfone and (especially in alternative medicine) methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). This colorless solid features the sulfonyl functional group and is the simplest of the sulfones. It is relatively inert chemically and is able to resist decomposition at elevated temperatures. It occurs naturally in some primitive plants, is present in small amounts in many foods and beverages, and is marketed (under the MSM name) as a dietary supplement. It is sometimes used as a cutting agent for illicitly manufactured methamphetamine. It is also commonly found in the atmosphere above marine areas, where it is used as a carbon source by the airborne bacteria &quot;Afipia&quot;. Oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide produces the sulfone, both under laboratory conditions and metabolically.

==Use as a solvent==
Because of its polarity and thermal stability, molten DMSO2 has been used industrially as a high-temperature solvent. For example, displacement of aryl chlorides by potassium fluoride has been conducted in the liquid.

With a pKa of 31, the sulfone can be deprotonated with sodium amide. The conjugate base has been used as a nucleophile.

==Medical and dietary use==
Methylsulfonylmethane is marketed as a dietary supplement with medical claims ranging from anti-inflammatory effects for pain management, skin condition and aging treatments, and immune system modulation. No medical uses for MSM have been approved and there is limited evidence to support most of the claims. Small studies of MSM have suggested some benefit for treatment of oxidative stress and osteoarthritis, but evidence for other uses is lacking.

=== Osteoarthritis ===
Methylsulfonylmethane may or may not be useful for osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain relief. Methodological issues with the clinical trials prevent firm conclusions, and the review authors stated: &quot;No definitive conclusion can currently be drawn&quot; and there is &quot;no definitive evidence that MSM is superior to placebo in the treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee.&quot;

=== Oxidative stress and inflammation ===
Multiple human and animal trials indicate MSM may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. 

== Contraindications and safety ==
In July 2007 a manufacturer of MSM submitted a notification to the U.S. FDA claiming generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status. GRAS status is for safety, and has no evaluation of efficacy. The FDA responded in February 2008 with a letter of non-objection, functionally designating OptiMSM, the branded form of MSM, as GRAS. The designation allows MSM to be added to processed foods.

The of MSM is greater than 17.5 grams per kilogram of body weight. Extensive research in animal models indicates MSM has a very low toxicity when administered both orally and topically. MSM is considered &#x27;Possibly Safe&#x27; at therapeutic doses.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacology and toxicity ===
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have demonstrated that oral doses of MSM are absorbed into the blood and cross the blood/brain barrier. An NMR study has also found detectable levels of MSM normally present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that it derives from dietary sources, intestinal bacterial metabolism, and the body&#x27;s endogenous methanethiol metabolism.

=== Mechanism of action ===
The mechanism of action underlying MSM&#x27;s medical claims is not clear. Some promoters suggest that most people do not consume enough sulfur. There is no Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) or Daily Value established for sulfur, but it is present in significant amounts in foods such as cruciferous vegetables, garlic, onions, asafoetida, legumes, nuts, seeds, plant milk, animal milk and eggs (both whites and yolks). The claims for the need for sulfur supplementation originate with Robert Herschler, a biochemist who filed a patent for using MSM as a dietary supplement in 1982.

Moreover, in cases involving topical therapeutics, the role of MSM as an active agent, per se, versus its having a role in promoting skin permeation (in manner, akin to its solvent relative DMSO) must be characterized/controlled.

The biochemical effects of supplemental methylsulfonylmethane are poorly understood. Some researchers have suggested that MSM has anti-inflammatory effects. 

The spectrum of biological effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MSM differ, but those of DMSO may be mediated, at least in part, by MSM.

== Research ==

=== Skin, hair, nails ===
The first scientific investigation of MSM for skin health was published in 2015. The RCT used a 3g per day dose and included only 20 women. Results showed significant improvements in the number and severity of facial wrinkles, firmness, tone and texture. Another study evaluated doses of 1g and 3g and showed improvements in wrinkles, firmness, and hydration at both dose levels in 20 persons. The same author published a study on MSM for hair and nails from the same clinical trial. The results showed improvements in hair shine, volume, and appearance, and nail shine and appearance. An Italian study evaluated the effects of a nutraceutical composed of MSM, hyaluronic acid, and L-carnosine. The results from RCT showed broad improvements in facial skin hydration and elasticity, as well as decreased sebaceous secretions.

=== Oxidative stress and inflammatory response ===
In one small human trial, MSM has been shown to protect muscles from damage by reducing the amount of oxidative stress damage incurred through exercise. In a second small trial the total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased after taking MSM. Studies in animals indicate a hepatoprotective effect of MSM against several toxins including acetaminophen, paraquat, and carbon tetrachloride. Animal models of experimental colitis and pulmonary hypertension indicate a protective effect as well.

=== Allergies and immunity ===
Two studies have evaluated the effects of MSM on allergic rhinitis. A 2004 multi-centered, open-label clinical trial found that MSM reduced both upper and lower respiratory symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), and increased energy levels. It found no significant changes in IgE levels, although the duration of the study was not likely long enough to see changes. An RCT evaluated three doses of MSM and found that a 3g daily dose was most effective compared to 1g or 6g per day. Daily use at 3g decreased allergy-associated symptoms, including itchy eyes, itchy nose, watery eyes, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction. The 3g dose also improved peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) indicating improved breathing. The study also evaluated an acute 12g dose and found significant improvements in all symptoms except itching eyes and sneezing, but not for PNIF.

MSM has been shown to improve immune function markers. RCT found that in blood samples taken after bouts of exhaustive exercise, there was a reduced response to an infectious stimulus in the placebo group, but the MSM group maintained a robust response, indicating that MSM protected against stress-induced immunosuppression. The authors postulate that MSM’s anti-inflammatory properties reduce the overstimulation of inflammatory cells during exercise, thus conserving their ability to respond to infections threats. This is supported by &quot;in vitro&quot; research showing MSM inhibits over-activation of white blood cells and has an anti-apoptotic effect.

<text>Maatia Toafa (born 1 May 1954) is a Tuvaluan politician, representing Nanumea, who served two non-consecutive terms as Prime Minister of Tuvalu. He first served as prime minister, and foreign minister, from 2004 to 2006, from the resignation of his predecessor, Saufatu Sopoanga, until the defeat of his Cabinet in the 2006 general election. From 2004 to 2006 he also held the role of foreign minister.

He was re-elected to parliament in the 2010 general election; and regained the premiership on 29 September 2010; however he lost the support of the parliament following a motion of confidence on 21 December of the same year. On 5 August 2013 Toafa became the Minister of Finance and Economic Development in the government of Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga. He was appointed as deputy prime minister following the 2015 Tuvaluan general election. He was not re-elected in the 2019 general election.

Prior to entering domestic Tuvaluan politics, Toafa worked for the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in Suva, Fiji.

==Prime Minister of Tuvalu (2004–06)==
Prime Minister Saufatu Sopoanga resigned from Parliament on 27 August 2004, after his government was deposed in a no confidence vote. Toafa, who was deputy prime minister at the time, became acting prime minister as a result of Sopoanga&#x27;s resignation from office. 
The 2004 Nukufetau by-election was held on 7 October; Sopoanga was reelected to parliament and parliament reconvened to elect a new prime minister. Toafa was confirmed as prime minister on 11 October 2004 with a vote of 8:7, Toafa also became Minister of Foreign Affairs.

During his term as prime minister Toafa undertook a review of the Constitution of Tuvalu and pledged to hold a referendum on whether the British monarch should be replaced as the Head of State of Tuvalu. The 2008 Tuvaluan constitutional referendum, held during the term of Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia, resulted in a majority vote against establishing a republic.

On Friday 16 September 2005, Toafa represented Tuvalu at the UN &#x27;2005 World Summit&#x27; discussing the problems faced by Small Island Developing States (SIDS), citing a lack of financial and technical access, Environmental security and infrastructural capacity. Toafa argued for the presence of permanent United Nations, activity in &#x27;isolated&#x27; SIDS countries such as Tuvalu. Maatia Toafa emphasized the impact of climate change as a &quot;broader security issue which relates to environmental security. Living in a very fragile island environment, our long-term security and sustainable development is closely linked to issues of climate change, preserving biodiversity, managing our limited forests and water

==Succession and subsequent career==

Toafa was reelected to Parliament during the 2006 general election, but all of the members of his Cabinet were defeated. On 14 August 2006 he was succeeded as prime minister by Apisai Ielemia. Toafa continued to serve as a member of the Parliament of Tuvalu as the Leader of the Opposition from 2006 until 2010.

==Prime Minister of Tuvalu (2010)==

Toafa was re-elected to Parliament from his Nanumea constituency in the 2010 Tuvaluan general election.

A secret ballot was held on 29 September 2010, approximately one and a half weeks after the general election, to determine the country&#x27;s next prime minister. Incumbent Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia, who had succeeded Toafa for the office in 2006, was not returned to second term. Toafa won the ballot with eight votes to become Tuvalu&#x27;s next prime minister. Toafa narrowly defeated Kausea Natano, who received the votes of seven MPs in the ballot. The election results were announced by Governor-General Iakoba Italeli and Toafa took office the same day.

On 5 October 2010 a week after his appointment as prime minister, Toafa was interviewed on Radio Australia by presenter Geraldine Coutts. Asked if the 15 member parliament had become more stable, after the election of five new MP&#x27;S Toafa replied (in reference to his new 8 member cabinet including 5 new MPS) &#x27;Yeah, I think the idea is to get the number right, meaning turn five because 15 altogether. Yeah, once I get the number right, then things can be more stabilised&#x27;. He also talked of the challenges the country faced due to the effects of climate change citing coral bleaching, changing weather patterns, water degradation and the effects of increased water salinity upon agriculture as evidence.
Upon taking office, he told Tuvalu News that his government would &quot;work for human security ensuring the basic human needs&quot; of the inhabitants of all nine islands and atolls, in particular by rapidly &quot;build[ing] up the[ir] economic infrastructure&quot;. This would require partnerships with donor countries, which he would seek to expand. He would also &quot;work aggressively on the world society to protect small countries&quot; from the effects of climate change.

On 21 December 2010, Toafa and his government were toppled by a parliamentary motion of confidence, by eight votes to seven. His Minister of Home Affairs, Willy Telavi, crossed the floor and enabled the Opposition to bring down the government. The motion was reportedly initiated due to MPs&#x27; concerns over certain aspects of the budget, in particular the prospect that the government may no longer fully fund patients&#x27; medical costs abroad. With a new prime minister due to be chosen on 24 December, Toafa announced that he would not be standing for the job, but that he hoped his deputy and Foreign Affairs and Environment Minister, Enele Sopoaga, would be chosen by Parliament in his place.

===Historical note===

In the history of independent Tuvalu, Bikenibeu Paeniu has been the only other prime minister apart from Maatia Toafa to have served a second period in that office.

==Honours==
Toafa was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours list &quot;for public and community service&quot;.

<doc id="945225" wikidata="Q3707726" url="?curid=945225" title="Isoperimetric dimension">
<text>In mathematics, the isoperimetric dimension of a manifold is a notion of dimension that tries to capture how the &quot;large-scale behavior&quot; of the manifold resembles that of a Euclidean space (unlike the topological dimension or the Hausdorff dimension which compare different &quot;local behaviors&quot; against those of the Euclidean space).

In the Euclidean space, the isoperimetric inequality says that of all bodies with the same volume, the ball has the smallest surface area. In other manifolds it is usually very difficult to find the precise body minimizing the surface area, and this is not what the isoperimetric dimension is about. The question we will ask is, what is &quot;approximately&quot; the minimal surface area, whatever the body realizing it might be.

==Formal definition==

We say about a differentiable manifold &quot;M&quot; that it satisfies a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional isoperimetric inequality if for any open set &quot;D&quot; in &quot;M&quot; with a smooth boundary one has

:formula_1

The notations vol and area refer to the regular notions of volume and surface area on the manifold, or more precisely, if the manifold has &quot;n&quot; topological dimensions then vol refers to &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume and area refers to (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional volume. &quot;C&quot; here refers to some constant, which does not depend on &quot;D&quot; (it may depend on the manifold and on &quot;d&quot;).

The isoperimetric dimension of &quot;M&quot; is the supremum of all values of &quot;d&quot; such that &quot;M&quot; satisfies a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional isoperimetric inequality.

==Examples==

A &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space has isoperimetric dimension &quot;d&quot;. This is the well known isoperimetric problem — as discussed above, for the Euclidean space the constant &quot;C&quot; is known precisely since the minimum is achieved for the ball. 

An infinite cylinder (i.e. a product of the circle and the line) has topological dimension 2 but isoperimetric dimension 1. Indeed, multiplying any manifold with a compact manifold does not change the isoperimetric dimension (it only changes the value of the constant &quot;C&quot;). Any compact manifold has isoperimetric dimension 0.

It is also possible for the isoperimetric dimension to be larger than the topological dimension. The simplest example is the infinite jungle gym, which has topological dimension 2 and isoperimetric dimension 3. See for pictures and Mathematica code.

The hyperbolic plane has topological dimension 2 and isoperimetric dimension infinity. In fact the hyperbolic plane has positive Cheeger constant. This means that it satisfies the inequality

:formula_2

which obviously implies infinite isoperimetric dimension.

==Consequences of isoperimetry==

A simple integration over &quot;r&quot; (or sum in the case of graphs) shows that a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional isoperimetric inequality implies a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional volume growth, namely

:formula_3

where &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) denotes the ball of radius &quot;r&quot; around the point &quot;x&quot; in the Riemannian distance or in the graph distance. In general, the opposite is not true, i.e. even uniformly exponential volume growth does not imply any kind of isoperimetric inequality. A simple example can be had by taking the graph Z (i.e. all the integers with edges between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot; + 1) and connecting to the vertex &quot;n&quot; a complete binary tree of height |&quot;n&quot;|. Both properties (exponential growth and 0 isoperimetric dimension) are easy to verify.

An interesting exception is the case of groups. It turns out that a group with polynomial growth of order &quot;d&quot; has isoperimetric dimension &quot;d&quot;. This holds both for the case of Lie groups and for the Cayley graph of a finitely generated group.

A theorem of Varopoulos connects the isoperimetric dimension of a graph to the rate of escape of random walk on the graph. The result states

&quot;Varopoulos&#x27; theorem: If G is a graph satisfying a d-dimensional isoperimetric inequality then&quot;

:formula_4

&quot;where&quot; formula_5 &quot;is the probability that a random walk on&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;starting from&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;will be in&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;after&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;steps, and&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;is some constant.&quot;

<doc id="945226" wikidata="Q213553" url="?curid=945226" title="Raul Hilberg">
<text>Raul Hilberg (June 2, 1926 – August 4, 2007) was a Jewish Austrian-born American political scientist and historian. He was widely considered to be the preeminent scholar on the Holocaust. Christopher R. Browning has called him the founding father of Holocaust studies and his three-volume, 1,273-page &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot;, is regarded as seminal for research into the Nazi Final Solution.

== Life and career ==
Hilberg was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Polish-speaking Jewish family. His father, a small-goods salesman, was born in a Galician village, moved to Vienna in his teens, was decorated for bravery on the Russian front in World War I, and married Hilberg&#x27;s mother who was from Buczacz, now in Ukraine.

The young Hilberg was a loner, pursuing solitary hobbies such as geography, music and train spotting. Though his parents attended synagogue on occasion, he personally found the irrationality of religion repellent and developed an aversion to it. He did however attend a Zionist school in Vienna, which inculcated in him the necessity of defending against, rather than surrendering to, the rising menace of Nazism. Following the March 1938 German annexation of Austria, his family was evicted from their home at gunpoint and his father was arrested by the Nazis; he was later released because of his service record as a combatant during World War I. One year later on April 1, 1939, at age 13, Hilberg fled Austria with his family; after reaching France, they embarked on a ship bound for Cuba. Following a four-month stay in Cuba, his family arrived in Miami, Florida, on September 1, 1939, the day the Second World War broke out in Europe. During the ensuing war in Europe, 26 members of Hilberg&#x27;s family were murdered in the Holocaust.

The Hilbergs settled in Brooklyn, New York, where Raul attended Abraham Lincoln High School and Brooklyn College. He intended to make a career in chemistry but found that it did not suit him, and he left his studies to work in a factory. He served in the United States Army from 1944 to 1946. As early as 1942, Hilberg, after reading scattered reports of what would later become known as the Nazi genocide, went so far as to ring Stephen Samuel Wise and ask him what he planned to do with regard to &quot;the complete annihilation of European Jewry&quot;. According to Hilberg, Wise hung up.

Hilberg served first in the 45th Infantry Division during World War II, but, given his native fluency in German and academic interests, he was soon attached to the War Documentation Department, charged with examining archives throughout Europe. While quartered in the Braunes Haus, he stumbled upon Hitler&#x27;s crated private library in Munich. This discovery, together with learning that 26 close members of his family had been exterminated, prompted Hilberg&#x27;s research into the Holocaust, a term which he personally disliked, though in later years he himself used it.

=== Academic career ===
After returning to civilian life, Hilberg chose to study political science, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree at Brooklyn College in 1948. He was deeply impressed by the importance of elites and bureaucracies while attending Hans Rosenberg&#x27;s lectures on the Prussian civil service. In 1947, at one particular point in Rosenberg&#x27;s course, Hilberg was taken aback when his teacher remarked: &quot;The most wicked atrocities perpetrated on a civilian population in modern times occurred during the Napoleonic occupation of Spain.&quot; The young Hilberg interrupted the lecture to ask why the recent murder of 6 million Jews did not figure in Rosenberg&#x27;s assessment. Rosenberg replied that it was a complicated matter, but that the lectures dealt only with history down to 1930, adding, &quot;History doesn&#x27;t reach down into the present age.&quot; Hilberg was amazed by this highly educated, German-Jewish emigrant passing over the genocide of European Jews in order to expound on Napoleon and the occupation of Spain. Hilberg recalled, it was an almost taboo topic in the Jewish community, and he pursued his research as a kind of &quot;protest against silence&quot;.

Hilberg went on to first complete a Master of Arts degree (1950) and then a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree (1955) at Columbia University, where he entered the graduate program in public law and government. In 1951, he obtained a temporary appointment to work on the War Documentation Project under the direction of Fritz T. Epstein. Hilberg was undecided under whom he should carry out his doctoral research. Having attended a course on international law, he was also attracted to the lectures of Salo Baron, the leading authority on Jewish historiography at the time, with particular expertise in the field of laws pertaining to the Jewish people. According to Hilberg, to attend Baron&#x27;s lectures was to enjoy the rare opportunity of observing &quot;a walking library, a monument of incredible erudition&quot;, active before his classroom of students. Baron asked Hilberg whether he was interested in working under him on the annihilation of Europe&#x27;s Jewish population. Hilberg demurred on the grounds that his interest lay in the &quot;perpetrators&quot;, and thus he would not begin with the Jews who were their victims, but rather with what was done to them.

Hilberg decided to write the greater part of his PhD under the supervision of Franz Neumann, the author of an influential wartime analysis of the German totalitarian state. Neumann was initially reluctant to take Hilberg on as his doctoral student. He had already read Hilberg&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis, and found, as both a deeply patriotic German and a Jew, that certain themes sketched there were unbearably painful. In particular he had asked that the section on Jewish cooperation be removed, to no avail. Neumann nonetheless relented, warning his student, however, that such a dissertation was professionally imprudent and might well prove to be his academic funeral. Undeterred by the prospect, Hilberg pressed on without regard for the possible consequences. Neumann himself contacted Nuremberg prosecutor Telford Taylor directly, to facilitate Hilberg&#x27;s access to the appropriate archives. After Neumann&#x27;s death in a traffic accident in 1954, Hilberg completed his doctoral requirement under the supervision of William T. R. Fox. His dissertation won him the university&#x27;s prestigious Clark F. Ansley Award in 1955, which carried with it the right to have his thesis published by his alma mater. He taught the first college-level course in the United States dedicated to the Holocaust, when the subject was finally introduced into his university&#x27;s curriculum in 1974.

Hilberg obtained his first academic position at the University of Vermont in 1955, and took up residence there in January 1956. Most of his teaching career was spent there, where he was a member of the Department of Political Science. He was appointed emeritus professor upon his retirement in 1991. In 2006, the university established the Raul Hilberg Distinguished Professorship of Holocaust Studies. Each year the University of Vermont&#x27;s Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies hosts the Raul Hilberg Memorial Lecture. Hilberg was appointed to the President&#x27;s Commission on the Holocaust by Jimmy Carter in 1979. He later served for many years on its successor, the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which is the governing body for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Following his death, the Museum established the Raul Hilberg Fellowship, intended to support the development of new generations of Holocaust scholars. For his seminal and profound services to the historiography of the Holocaust, he was honored with Germany&#x27;s Order of Merit, the highest recognition that can be paid to a non-German. In 2002, he was awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for &quot;Die Quellen des Holocaust&quot; (Sources of the Holocaust). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005 .

== &quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot; ==
Hilberg is best known for his influential study of the Holocaust, &quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot;. His approach assumed that the event of the Shoah was not &quot;unique&quot;. He said in a late interview:For me the Holocaust was a vast, single event, but I am never going to use the word &quot;unique&quot;, because I recognize that when one starts breaking it into pieces, which is my trade, one finds completely recognizable, ordinary ingredients.His final doctoral supervisor, Professor Fox, worried that the original study was far too long. Hilberg therefore suggested submitting a mere quarter of the research he had written up, and his proposal was accepted. His PhD dissertation was awarded the prestigious Clark F. Ansley prize, which entitled it to be published by Columbia University Press in a print run of 850 copies. However, Hilberg was firm in desiring that the whole work be published, not just the doctoral version. To obtain this, two opinions in favor of full publication were required. Yad Vashem as early as 1958, declined to participate in its projected publication, fearing that it would encounter &quot;hostile criticism&quot;. The work was duly submitted to two additional academic authorities in the field, but both judgments were negative, viewing Hilberg&#x27;s work as polemical: one rejected it as anti-German, the other rejected it as anti-Jewish.

=== Struggle for publication ===
Hilberg, unwilling to compromise, submitted the complete manuscript to several major publishing houses over the following six years, without luck. Princeton University Press turned down the manuscript, on Hannah Arendt&#x27;s advice, after quickly vetting it in a mere two weeks. After successive rejections from five prominent publishers, it finally went to press in 1961 under a minor imprint, the Chicago-based publisher, Quadrangle Books. Yad Vashem also reneged on an initial agreement to publish the manuscript, since it treated as marginal the armed Jewish resistance central to the Zionist narrative. By good fortune, a wealthy patron, Frank Petschek, a German-Czech Jew whose family coal business had suffered from the Nazi Aryanization program, laid out $15,000, a substantial sum at the time, to cover the costs of a print run of 5,500 volumes, of which some 1,300 copies were set aside for distribution to libraries.

Resistance to Hilberg&#x27;s work, the difficulties he encountered in finding a US editor, and subsequent delays with the German edition, owed much to the Cold War atmosphere of the times, according to Norman Finkelstein. Finkelstein observed in a 2007 article for &quot;CounterPunch&quot;:
It is hard now to remember that the Nazi holocaust was once a taboo subject. During the early years of the Cold War, mention of the Nazi holocaust was seen as undermining the critical U.S.–West German alliance. It was airing the dirty laundry of the barely de-Nazified West German elites and thereby playing into the hands of the Soviet Union, which didn&#x27;t tire of remembering the crimes of the West German &quot;revanchists.&quot;

The German rights to the book were acquired by the German publishing firm Droemer Knaur in 1963. Droemer Knaur, however, after dithering over it for two years, decided against publication, due to the work&#x27;s documentation of certain episodes of cooperation by Jewish authorities with the executors of the Holocaustmaterial which the editors said would only play into the hands of the antisemitic right wing in Germany. Hilberg dismissed this fear as &quot;nonsense&quot;. Some two decades were to pass before it finally came out in a German edition in 1982, under the imprint of a Berlin publishing house. Hilberg – a lifelong Republican voter, according to both Norman Finkelstein and Michael Neumann – seemed to be somewhat bemused by the prospect of being published under such an imprint, and asked its director, Ulf Wolter, what on earth his massive treatise on the Holocaust had in common with some of the firm&#x27;s staple themes, socialism and women&#x27;s rights. Wolter replied succinctly: &quot;Injustice!&quot;. In a letter of July 14, 1982, Hilberg had written to director Ulf Wolter the partner of
Werner Olle in the firm &quot;Olle &amp; Wolter&quot;, &quot;Everything you said to me during this brief visit has impressed me very much and has given me a good feeling about our joint venture. I am glad that you are my publisher in Germany.&quot; He spoke about a &quot;second edition&quot; of his work, &quot;solid enough for the next century&quot;.

=== Approach and structure of book ===
&quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot; provided &quot;the first clear description of (the) incredibly complicated machinery of destruction&quot; (Hannah Arendt) set up under Nazism. For Hilberg there was deep irony in the judgement since Arendt, asked to give an opinion of his manuscript in 1959, had advised against publication. Her judgement influenced the rejection slip he received from Princeton University Press following its submission, thus denying him a mainstream academic publishing house.

With a terse lucidity that ranged, with unsparing meticulousness, over the huge archives of Nazism, Hilberg delineated the history of the mechanisms, political, legal, administrative and organizational, whereby the Holocaust was perpetrated, as it was seen through German eyes, often by the anonymous clerks whose unquestioning dedication to their duties was central to the efficacy of the industrial project of genocide. Hilberg refrained from laying emphasis on the suffering of the victims of the Holocaust or their lives in concentration camps. The Nazi program entailed the destruction of all peoples whose existence was deemed incompatible with the world-historical destiny of a pure master raceand to accomplish this project, they had to develop techniques, muster resources, make bureaucratic decisions, organize fields and camps of extermination and recruit cadres capable of executing the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. It was enough to find each intricate strand of communication over how to conduct the operation efficiently through the enormous archival paper trail to show how this took place. Thus his discourse probed the bureaucratic means for implementing genocide, to let the implicit horror of the process speak for itself.

In this he differed radically from those who had focused on final responsibilities, as for example in the case of his predecessor Gerald Reitlinger&#x27;s groundbreaking history of the subject. Because of this layered, departmentalized structure of the bureaucracy overseeing the intricate policies of classifying, mustering and deporting victims, individual functionaries saw their roles as distinct from the actual &quot;perpetration&quot; of the Holocaust. Thus, for these reasons, an administrator, clerk or uniformed guard never referred to himself as a &quot;perpetrator&quot;. Hilberg made it clear that such functionaries were quite aware of their involvement in what was a process of destruction. Hilberg&#x27;s minute documentation constructed a functional analysis of the machinery of genocide, while leaving unaddressed any questions of historical antisemitism, and possible structural elements in Germany&#x27;s historical-social tradition which might have conduced to the unparalleled industrialization of the European Jewish catastrophe by that country.

Yehuda Bauer, a lifelong adversary and friend of Hilberg,he had assisted him in finally getting access to Yad Vashem&#x27;s archiveswho often clashed polemically with the man he considered &quot;without fault&quot; over what Bauer saw as the latter&#x27;s failure to deal with the complex dilemmas of Jews caught up in this machinery, recalls often prodding Hilberg on his exclusive focus on the &quot;how&quot; of the Holocaust rather than the &quot;why&quot;. According to Bauer, Hilberg &quot;did not ask the big questions for fear that the answers would be too little&quot; or, as Hilberg says in Claude Lanzmann&#x27;s film &quot;Shoah&quot;, &quot;I have never begun by asking the big questions, because I was always afraid that I would come up with small answers&quot;.

Hilberg&#x27;s empirical, descriptive approach to the Holocaust, though it exercised a not fully acknowledged but pervasive influence on the far better-known work of Hannah Arendt, &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;, in turn aroused considerable controversy, not least because of its details concerning the cooperation of Jewish councils in the procedures of evacuation to the camps. Hilberg responded graciously to Isaiah Trunk&#x27;s pathfinding research on the &quot;Judenräte&quot;, which was critical of Hilberg&#x27;s assessment of the issue.

=== Critical reception ===
Hilberg&#x27;s study was praised by scholars and the American press. His findings that all of German society was involved in the &quot;destruction process&quot; drew attention. Some scholars argued that Hilberg overlooked Nazi ideology and the nature of the regime. Hilberg&#x27;s claim that Jews abetted their own persecutors sparked a debate among Jewish scholars and in Jewish press. According to a 2021 study, &quot;the reception of Hilberg&#x27;s work marks a crucial step in the formation of the Holocaust as part of historical consciousness.&quot;

At the time, most historians of the phenomenon subscribed to what would today be called the extreme intentionalist position, where sometime early in his career, Hitler developed a master plan for the genocide of the Jewish people and that everything that happened was the unfolding of the plan. This clashed with the lesson Hilberg had absorbed under Neumann, whose &quot;&quot; (1942/1944) described the Nazi regime as a virtually stateless political order characterized by chronic bureaucratic infighting and turf disputes. The task Hilberg set for himself was to analyze the way the overall policies of genocide were engineered within the otherwise conflicting politics of Nazi factions. It helped that the Americans classifying the huge amount of Nazi documents used, precisely, the categories his future mentor Neumann had employed in his &quot;Behemoth&quot; study.

Hilberg came to be considered as the foremost representative of what a later generation has called the functionalist school of Holocaust historiography, of which Christopher Browning, whose life was changed by reading Hilberg&#x27;s book, is a prominent member. The debate is that Intentionalists see &quot;the Holocaust as Hitler&#x27;s determined and premeditated plan, which he implemented as the opportunity arose&quot;, while functionalists see &quot;the Final Solution as an evolution that occurred when other plans proved untenable&quot;. Intentionalists argue that the initiative for the Holocaust came from above, while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy.

It has often been observed that Hilberg&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; begins with an intentionalist thesis but gradually shifts towards a functionalist position. At the time, this approach raised a few eyebrows but only later did it actually attract pointed academic discussion. A further move towards a functionalist interpretation occurred in the revised 1985 edition, in which Hitler is portrayed as a remote figure hardly involved in the machinery of destruction. The terms &quot;functionalist&quot; and &quot;intentionalist&quot; were coined in 1981 by Timothy Mason but the debate goes back to 1969 with the publication of Martin Broszat&#x27;s &quot;The Hitler State&quot; in 1969 and Karl Schleunes&#x27;s &quot;The Twisted Road to Auschwitz&quot; in 1970. Since most of the early functionalist historians were West German, it was often enough for intentionalist historians, especially for those outside Germany, to note that men such as Broszat and Hans Mommsen had spent their adolescence in the Hitler Youth and then to say that their work was an apologia for National Socialism. Hilberg was Jewish and an Austrian who had fled to the United States to escape the Nazis and had no Nazi sympathies, which helps to explain the vehemence of the attacks by intentionalist historians that greeted the revised edition of &quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot; in 1985.

Hilberg&#x27;s understanding of the relationship between the leadership of Nazi Germany and the implementers of the genocide evolved from an interpretation based on orders to the RSHA originating with Adolf Hitler and proclaimed by Hermann Göring, to a thesis consistent with Christopher Browning&#x27;s &quot;The Origins of the Final Solution&quot;, an account in which initiatives were undertaken by mid-level officials in response to general orders from senior ones. Such initiatives were broadened by mandates from senior officials and propagated by increasingly informal channels. The experience gained in fulfilling the initiatives fed an understanding in the bureaucracy that radical goals were attainable, progressively reducing the need for direction. As Hilberg put it,

As the Nazi regime developed over the years, the whole structure of decision-making was changed. At first there were laws. Then there were decrees implementing laws. Then a law was made saying, &quot;There shall be no laws.&quot; Then there were orders and directives that were written down, but still published in ministerial gazettes. Then there was government by announcement; orders appeared in newspapers. Then there were the quiet orders, the orders that were not published, that were within the bureaucracy, that were oral. Finally, there were no orders at all. Everybody knew what he had to do.

In earlier editions of &quot;Destruction&quot;, in fact, Hilberg discussed an &quot;order&quot; given by Hitler to have Jews killed, while more recent editions do not refer to a direct command. In a 1999 interview with D.D. Guttenplan, Hilberg commented that he &quot;made this change in the interest of precision about the evidence ...&quot;. Notwithstanding Hilberg&#x27;s focus on bureaucratic momentum as an indispensable force behind the Holocaust, he maintained that extermination of Jews was one of Hitler&#x27;s aims: &quot;The primary notion in Germany is that Hitler did it. As it happens, this is also my notion, but I&#x27;m not wedded to it&quot; (qtd. in —).

This contradicts the thesis advanced by Daniel Goldhagen that the ferocity of German anti-Semitism is sufficient as an explanation for the Holocaust; Hilberg noted that anti-Semitism was more vicious in Eastern Europe than in Nazi Germany. Hilberg criticized Goldhagen&#x27;s scholarship, which he called poor (&quot;his scholarly standard is at the level of 1946&quot;) and he was even harsher concerning the lack of primary sources or secondary literature competence at Harvard by those who oversaw the research for Goldhagen&#x27;s book. Hilberg said, &quot;This is the only reason why Goldhagen could obtain a PhD in political science at Harvard. There was nobody on the faculty who could have checked his work.&quot; This remark has been echoed by Yehuda Bauer.

What is most contentious about Hilberg&#x27;s work, the controversial implications of which influenced the decision by Israeli authorities to deny him access to the Yad Vashem&#x27;s archives, was his assessment that elements of Jewish society, such as the &quot;Judenräte&quot; (Jewish Councils), were complicit in the genocide. and that this was partly rooted in long-standing attitudes of European Jews, rather than attempts at survival or exploitation. In his own words:

I had to examine the Jewish tradition of trusting God, princes, laws and contracts ... Ultimately I had to ponder the Jewish calculation that the persecutor would not destroy what he could economically exploit. It was precisely this Jewish strategy that dictated accommodation and precluded resistance.

This part of his work was criticized harshly by many Jews as impious, and a defamation of the dead. His master&#x27;s thesis sponsor persuaded him to remove this idea from his thesis, though he was determined to restore it. Even his father, on reading his manuscript, was disconcerted.

The result of his approach, and the sharp criticism it aroused in certain quarters, was such, as he records in the same book, that:

It has taken me some time to absorb what I should always have known, that in my whole approach to the study of the destruction of the Jews I was pitting myself against the main current of Jewish thought, that in my research and writing I was pursuing not merely another direction but one which was the exact opposite of a signal that pulsated endlessly through the Jewish community... The philistines in my field are everywhere. I am surrounded by the commonplace, platitudes, and clichés.

==Public role==
Hilberg was the only scholar interviewed for Claude Lanzmann&#x27;s &quot;Shoah&quot; that actually made it into the film (interviews of other scholars, such as theologian Richard L. Rubenstein, remained as outtakes; they can be viewed at the U.S. Holocaust Museum). According to Guy Austin Hilberg was &quot;a key influence on Lanzmann&quot; in depicting the logistics of the genocide.

He was a strong supporter of the research of Norman Finkelstein during the latter&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to secure tenure; of Finkelstein&#x27;s book &quot;The Holocaust Industry&quot;, which Hilberg endorsed &quot;with specific regard&quot; to his demonstration that the money claimed to be owed by Swiss banks to Holocaust survivors was greatly exaggerated; and of his critique of Daniel Goldhagen&#x27;s &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot;. Hilberg also made a posthumous appearance in the 2009 film, &quot;American Radical: The Trials of Norman Finkelstein&quot;.

In regard to claims that a New anti-Semitism was emerging, Hilberg, speaking in 2007, was dismissive. Comparing incidents in recent times with the socially entrenched structural anti-Semitism of the past was like &quot;picking up a few pebbles from the past and throwing them at windows.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Hilberg had two children, David and Deborah, by his first wife, Christine Hemenway. After his divorce, in 1980 he married Gwendolyn Montgomery. Deborah moved to Israel when she was 18, acquired dual citizenship, and became a specialist teacher of children with learning disabilities. She has written memorably of her father&#x27;s approach to rearing in an article composed on the occasion of the publication of the Hebrew translation of &quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot;, in 2012.

Hilberg was not religious, and he considered himself an atheist. In his autobiographical reflections he stated, &quot;The fact is that I have had no God.&quot; In a 2001 interview that addressed the issue of Holocaust denial, he said, &quot;I am an atheist. But there is ultimately, if you don&#x27;t want to surrender to nihilism entirely, the matter of a [historical] record.&quot; After his second wife&#x27;s autonomous decision, 12 years into their marriage, to convert from Episcopalianism to Judaism, in 1993, Hilberg began quietly to attend services at Ohavi Zedek, a Conservative synagogue in Burlington. What he most esteemed, and identified with in his own tradition, was the ideal of the Jew as &quot;pariah&quot;. As he put it in a 1965 essay, &quot;Jews are iconoclasts. They will not worship idols... The Jews are the conscience of the world. They are the father figures, stern, critical, and forbidding.&quot;

Though a non-smoker, Hilberg died following a recurrence of lung cancer on August 4, 2007, aged 81, in Williston, Vermont.

<doc id="945241" wikidata="Q3303164" url="?curid=945241" title="RAF Linton-on-Ouse">
<text>Royal Air Force Linton-on-Ouse or more simply RAF Linton-on-Ouse is a former Royal Air Force station at Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire, England, north-west of York. It had satellite stations at RAF Topcliffe and Dishforth Airfield (British Army).

The station opened in 1937. With the transfer of pilot training to RAF Valley on Anglesey in 2019, the station closed in 2020. In February 2021, the MOD confirmed that no alternative military use had been identified for the site and that it would therefore be sold. 

== History ==
RAF Linton-on-Ouse opened on 13 May 1937 as a bomber airfield and was the home of No. 4 Group RAF until 1940. The base&#x27;s first commander was Wing Commander A. D. Pryor.

When the Second World War began, bombers were launched from Linton to drop propaganda leaflets over Germany and the base was eventually used to launch bombing raids on Norway, The Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Linton was one of 11 stations allocated to No. 6 Group, Royal Canadian Air Force during the war.

In May 1941 the station was bombed by the Luftwaffe resulting in the death of 13 airmen including the station commander, Group Captain Garroway. A &quot;York Press&quot; article refers to the &#x27;mystery&#x27; of how Garroway was killed – the station&#x27;s record books state he was directing firefighting when he met his death, not taking shelter. His son, who was also in the RAF, was later killed in action.

At the end of the war the station was involved with transporting passengers and freight back to the UK. After which it became a Fighter Command station operating the Gloster Meteor, Canadair Sabre and Hawker Hunter until it was closed and put under care and maintenance in 1957.

On 9 September 1957, the base was reopened as the home of No. 1 Flying Training School (FTS) and was responsible for training pilots for both the RAF and the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm.

In October 1975 Headquarters No. 23 Group RAF disbanded at the station.

Between March 1979 and March 1980 the BBC filmed episodes 4, 5 and 6 of the Fighter Pilot series at the base. The series aired in 1981.

In 1985, engineering and supply services were contracted out to private firms. The contract for this was held by Babcock International.

Between 1992 and 1994 the Chief Flying Instructor was Wing Commander Paul McDonald (later Group Captain), author of several books including his memoirs, &#x27;Winged Warriors - The Cold War from the Cockpit&#x27; in which he describes his tour at RAF Linton-on-Ouse. Following his retirement from regular service, Paul McDonald returned to the station as a Tucano simulator instructor.

No. 1 Flying Training School was the last RAF Unit to operate the BAC Jet Provost T3A and T5A which were replaced in 1993 by the Short Tucano T1.

In 1999 the entire NCO married quarter site at Linton Woods were purchased by The Welbeck Estate Group and underwent a major upgrade.

No. 72(R) Squadron provided Basic Fast Jet Training (BFJT) at Linton-on-Ouse on the Short Tucano T1 before the Squadron&#x27;s move to RAF Valley in November 2019.

The Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron relocated to RAF Linton-on-Ouse from RAF Church Fenton in 2014. YUAS operated the Grob Tutor T1 aircraft.

The station also housed a memorial room (limited public opening) which recounts the history of the base and the units which have been associated with it.
=== Drawdown and closure ===
In October 2014, it was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) that basic fast-jet training would move from Linton-on-Ouse to RAF Valley in Anglesey in 2019. The move was part of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) which saw the Beechcraft Texan T1 replace the Tucano T1 in the basic fast-jet training role. At that time, the MOD did not confirm what future role Linton-on-Ouse would have, but in July 2018, it was stated that the RAF would vacate the base by 2020 and it would be disposed of completely. However, in March 2019, the MOD indicated it was considering options for other defence uses for the site, before a final decision was made.

Flying training ceased in October 2019, when the final student pilots graduated and training fully relocated to Valley. The final flying unit to depart was the Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron, which relocated to RAF Leeming on 1 December 2020. The MOD notified the Civil Aviation Authority that the aerodrome would close on 18 December 2020. In February 2021, the MOD confirmed that no alternative military use had been identified for the site and that it would therefore be made available for sale by the end of 2023.

In August 2021, the station was used to support COVID-19 countermeasures for personnel returning from Afghanistan on Operation Pitting.

=== Proposed processing centre for asylum seekers ===

In April 2022, the government announced its intention to convert the camp into a reception, accommodation and processing centre for asylum seekers, as a way of defraying the £4.7 million per day cost of hotels being used. The plan was met by resistance from local residents who claim that asylum seekers will outnumber existing residents. The press has used the moniker &quot;Guantánamo-on-Ouse&quot; to describe the proposal, in reference to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. However, on 9 August 2022, the government backtracked on this policy, with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace stating this plan would now not go ahead.

== Motorsport ==
In the summers of 1960 and 1961, the perimeter track and parts of two runways were used to form the 1.7 mile, Linton-on-Ouse circuit, on what was still an operational RAF base, with the racing organised by the Northern branch of the British Racing and Sports Car Club. The 1960 meeting was held in torrential rain and Tony Hodgetts recalls blue sparks coming off his fingers as he cranked the field telephone which was used by the marshals to communicate with race control. The meeting was dominated by Jimmy Blumer in his Cooper Monaco T49. The final meeting in 1961 was marred by a fatal accident to a flag marshal. The driver of the Formula Junior car involved was a serving RAF officer and, following the inquest into the death of the marshal, the venue was no longer available. After this sad incident and a near fatality to another flag marshal at Full Sutton Circuit, Tony Hodgetts and Garth Nicholls started a campaign which resulted in flag marshals working face to face instead of back to back, a system which is still in use and is considerably safer.

==Units==

The following squadrons were here at some point:

;Units
==November 2008 incident==
In early November 2008 Wing Commander Paul Gerrard, who was based at the station, was involved in an unusual mid-air rescue. Sixty-five-year-old Jim O&#x27;Neill was flying a four-seater Cessna 182 from Scotland to Essex after a family holiday, when he had a stroke which caused temporary blindness. Gerrard was on a training flight, and after being alerted to the situation, located O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s aircraft and over a 45-minute period, guided O&#x27;Neill to a safe landing at Linton.

<doc id="945251" wikidata="Q638551" url="?curid=945251" title="Ardara, County Donegal">
<text>Ardara ( ; ) is a small town in County Donegal, Ireland. It is located on the N56 and R261 roads. The population as of the 2022 census was 785. The population of 731 at the 2011 Census represented an increase of about 30% since 2006. In 2012, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; named it the best village in which to live in Ireland.

Ardara, one of Donegal’s five designated heritage towns, is located in the southwest of the county. The town is near the Owenea River, known for salmon and trout fishing. Just beyond Ardara lies the Glengesh Pass, a scenic route leading to Glencolumbkille.

==History==
The Donegal County Directory for 1862 shows the administrative positions that were held in the county in that year, including several in Ardara. There is a photograph of Brendan Behan in Ardara with a glass of tomato juice while visiting Gildea&#x27;s (now the Beehive) in 1960.

The town&#x27;s name derives from an ancient earthen ring-fort that sits atop a hill northeast of the town. Christianity was introduced to Ardara in the 6th century by Saint Conall Caol, a direct descendant of Saint Colmcille. From the mid-17th to the late 19th century, the Nesbitt family of Woodhill played a significant role in Ardara&#x27;s commercial development.

Ardara has a long-standing association with the tweed and knitwear industries. Since the 1870s, this trade has been a cottage industry, with locals producing hand-spun and hand-dyed woollen and tweed garments. The Ardara Heritage Centre, formerly the town&#x27;s courthouse, provides insights into the evolution of the tweed industry. Today, several shops in Ardara continue to sell local tweed and knitwear.

Stained-glass artist Evie Hone&#x27;s Rose Window can be seen in Ardara&#x27;s Holy Family Church.

==Outdoor activities==
The Owenea River has salmon and trout fishing. There is pony trekking and surfing on local beaches. The nearby Narin and Portnoo links offers golfing.

==Festivals==
Ardara&#x27;s numerous festivals include the Cupan Tae Festival, Johnny Doherty Festival, Bluegrass Festival, Matchmaking Festival, Wild Atlantic Festival, Country &amp; Western Festival, Walking Festival, Ardara Show Day and Melting Pot Festival.

<doc id="945259" wikidata="Q7364958" url="?curid=945259" title="Ronald I. Spiers">
<text>Ronald Ian &quot;Ron&quot; Spiers (July 9, 1925 – June 24, 2021) was an American diplomat who served as an Ambassador to several countries during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life and military career==
Spiers was born in Orange, New Jersey in July 1925 but grew up in Peru, London, Paris and Brussels. During World War II, he served as an Ensign in the United States Navy in the war&#x27;s Pacific theater. He later became the commanding officer of an amphibious landing craft.

Spiers graduated from Madison (NJ) High School in 1943, then attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1948 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He also attended the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, earning his Master of Public Affairs degree in 1950.

==Government service==
After graduating from Princeton, Spiers became a foreign affairs specialist with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, serving until 1955, when he began his career with the U.S. Foreign Service, in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs. During his AEC career he conceived the proposal for what became the International Atomic Energy Agency.

During his career with the State Department, Spiers worked in a variety of assignments, often involving arms control. He served at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations (in Geneva), as a negotiator for the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and also was a U.S. negotiator in a series of arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, including the Partial Test Ban Treaty, Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, First Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

In 1964 Spiers became director of NATO Affairs, serving until 1966, when he was appointed the Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy to the United Kingdom. In 1969 he was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs by President Nixon, serving until 1973 when he was chosen by President Nixon to be the first U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. In 1974 he returned to London as Charge d&#x27;affaires and Deputy Chief of Mission, holding this post until 1977 when he was appointed by President Carter as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey. In January 1980 he was selected to be Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research by President Carter. He was selected by President Reagan to be Ambassador to Pakistan in 1981.

On August 4, 1983, President Ronald Reagan nominated Spiers to be Under Secretary of State for Management. He served through the Reagan Administration as Undersecretary of State. Toward the end of the Reagan Administration George Shultz attempted to place Spiers as U.S. Ambassador to Canada. Congresswoman Olympia Snowe of Maine wrote to Reagan, pointed out that Maine had a deep interest in US-Canadian relations, and argued that Spiers was not suitable for such a key job. Shultz then offered Spiers for the job of UN Undersecretary for Political Affairs. In the UN&#x27;s patronage system, that job was given to the candidate chosen by the State Department. In this position Spiers became the highest-ranking American citizen in the United Nations Secretariat.

Spiers retired in March 1992 with two Presidential Distinguished Executive Service Awards and the rank of Career Ambassador, an honorary rank he was accorded by the President and the US Senate in 1984. Equivalent to &quot;four star&quot; military rank it is reserved for a small number of career Foreign Service officers who have served with distinction in the highest positions of the Foreign Service.

==Life after government service==
In 2004 Spiers again returned to the public eye when he joined Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change, a group of former diplomats, ambassadors, and military leaders criticizing the foreign policy of President George W. Bush and supporting the election of John Kerry in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Spiers died in Exeter, New Hampshire in June 2021, at the age of 95.

<doc id="945265" wikidata="Q1650406" url="?curid=945265" title="Abbeyleix">
<text>Abbeyleix (; ) is a town in County Laois, Ireland, located around south of the county town of Portlaoise. Abbelyleix is in a civil parish of the same name.

Abbeyleix was formerly located on the N8, the main road from Dublin to Cork. At one point, up to 15,000 vehicles passed along the town&#x27;s main street every day. Since May 2010, however, the town has been bypassed by the M8 motorway, with the former N8 consequently downgraded to the N77 national secondary road, and R639 regional road.

Abbeyleix was named Ireland&#x27;s Tidiest Town in 2023.

== History ==
There was a settlement at Abbeyleix as early as 1183, that grew up near the River Nore, around the Cistercian monastery - which gives the town its name.

The monastery, known as &quot;Clonkyne Leix&quot; or &quot;De Lege Dei&quot;, was reputedly founded about the year 600 AD, but of which there is limited account until 1183, when it was refounded and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin by Conogher or Corcheger O&#x27;More (Conor Cucoigcriche). O&#x27;More placed in it monks of the Cistercian order from Baltinglass, County Wicklow.

The lordship of &quot;Feranamanagh&quot; (i.e. the Monk&#x27;s land), consisting of the parish of Abbeyleix, is shown on a map of the territories of Leix and Offaly from 1561.

Modern Abbeyleix is one of the oldest planned estate towns in Ireland. It was largely built in the 18th century by Viscount de Vesci. The regular flooding of the River Nore made the town an unhealthy place to live. Around 1790, John Vesey determined that the location of the town was not suitable for his tenants, and began to design a new one. The old town was levelled, and the residents moved to the new one. A memorial to the 2nd Viscount de Vesci, paid for by subscriptions, is in the town center. It features a water trough for horses.

Today, there are many historical structures standing in and around the town - ancient ring forts, burial grounds, churches and estate houses. The town once had a carpet factory, established in 1904 by Yvo de Vesci, the 5th Viscount – notably producing some of the carpets used on the RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; and RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
The N8 road to Cork passed through Abbeyleix prior to the opening of the M8 motorway in 2010. With the opening of the M8 the N77 road was extended along the route of the former N8 from Durrow to Portlaoise. Access to the M8 from Abbeyleix is also provided via the R433 road.

=== Rail ===
Abbeyleix railway station, on the line from Portlaoise to Kilkenny, opened on 1 March 1865 and closed on 1 January 1963.

=== Bus ===
Both Bus Éireann&#x27;s Expressway service and the Aircoach service, between Dublin and Cork, ceased to serve Abbeyleix in 2012. As an interim measure, until August 2012, Bus Éireann operated a shuttle service (route 128) to connect with Expressway services at Portlaoise. Slieve Bloom Coaches also have a route from Borris-in-Ossory to Portlaoise which serves the town.

The TFI Local Link 828 and 858 bus services connect Abbeyleix to Portlaoise and Cashel and Thurles.

== Amenities ==

There is a district hospital in the town, and a number of shops and pubs. Father Breen Park has fields for soccer and other sports, while the adjacent CYMS hall is home to a number of clubs.

The &quot;Lords Walk Loop&quot; is a 2.4 kilometer loop that traces an old walking route taken by the De Vesci Family to reach the local church and railway station.

Killamuck Bog is managed by the Abbeyleix Bog Project which has constructed two looped walks through the bog. The entrance to the bog is located by the Abbeyleix Manor Hotel. The two loops have raised wooden broad walks that traverse through the bog, as well as paths and tracks.

The Abbeyleix Heritage House is a local heritage centre, with visitor information and an exhibition on the county&#x27;s history and local attractions. Original antique carpets and vintage costumes are on display alongside archaeological and historical artefacts. Heritage House also provides guided tours of the museum and runs workshops throughout the year.

== Buildings of note ==

Abbeyleix House and the de Vesci estate (Abbeyleix Estate) is located on the Ballacolla road. As of 2019, the estate was being marketed for sale, with an asking price of €20 million. The house and 1050 acre estate was sold in 2021 for €20 to Irish entrepreneur John Collinson. Millbrook House which is located beside the de Vesci estate was also purchased by Collinson in 2022.

Within the town, Abbeyleix Market House is a five-bay, four storey building which was previously used as a fire station and library. It has been renovated as a library and exhibition centre. Heritage House is a visitor centre which houses a local history museum. This 19th-century building was once the North Boys School. Both the Market House and Heritage House are listed on the Record of Protected Structures for County Laois.

== Sport ==
Abbeyleix GAA club is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Abbeyleix Golf Club and Abbeyleix Lawn Tennis Club were established in 1895 and 1909 respectively. Other sports clubs in the area include a hockey club and soccer (association football) club.

<text>Sir David Clive Crosbie Trench (; 2 June 1915 – 4 December 1988) was a British Army officer and colonial governor who served as the Governor of Hong Kong from April 15, 1964 to October 19, 1971 and was High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.

==Early life==
Trench was educated at Tonbridge School, Tonbridge, Kent and graduated from Jesus College, Cambridge with the degree of Master of Arts (M.A.).

==War service==
In 1938, Trench entered the Colonial Service as a cadet in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate and was seconded to the Western Pacific High Commission in 1941. He was also commissioned into the Royal Artillery (Supplementary Reserve). From 1939 to 1945, he fought in the Second World War and served in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force from 1942 to 1946. For this, Trench was awarded the decoration of the Military Cross and the US Legion of Merit in 1944. That year he was posted to the island of Malaita, with the task of repressing the Maasina Rule, an uprising aimed at securing independence for Malaita. In August 1947, he was appointed Secretary for Development and Native Affairs, and his crackdown on the Maasina Rule continued.

Trench attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1947 and studied at the Joint Services Command and Staff College in Swindon, Wiltshire in 1949.

==Colonial administration career==
Trench served as Governor of the Solomon Islands and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific from 1961 to 1964. In 1950, Trench became Assistant Secretary to the Deputy Defence Secretary for Hong Kong. He eventually held the office of Deputy Financial Secretary in 1956 and Commissioner of Labour and Mines in 1957. In 1958, Trench studied at the Imperial Defence College in London.

Trench served as Deputy Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong between 1959 and 1960. He left Hong Kong to take up the office of High Commissioner for the British Western Pacific Territories between 1961 and 1964, but returned to Hong Kong as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Hong Kong between 1964 and 1971.

His governorship in Hong Kong inherited from his predecessor an increasingly prosperous city, along with numerous social issues that came with it: water shortages, refugees from mainland China, and an alarming rise in corruption. After major riots in 1966 and 1967, his administration belatedly introduced some social reforms, including the establishment of City District Offices in 1968 as links between the government and the public; the legislation of an eight-hour work day, six-day work week in 1971; and the introduction of a six-year compulsory primary school education, also in 1971.

==Personal life==
Trench married Margaret Gould on 18 August 1944. The couple had one daughter, Katherine Elizabeth (1956–2017). Trench was also a distant kinsman of the Barons Ashtown, and one of his distant relatives, Nigel Clive Cosby Trench, also worked in the Foreign Service and succeeded to the Barony of Ashtown in 1990.

Trench died on 4 December 1988, aged 73.

<doc id="945273" wikidata="Q64029" url="?curid=945273" title="Canon EOS 20D">
<text>The [[Canon EOS]] 20D is an 8.2-megapixel semi-professional digital single-lens reflex camera, initially announced on 19 August 2004 at a recommended retail price of US$1,499. It is the successor of the EOS 10D, and was succeeded by the EOS 30D in August 2006. It accepts EF and EF-S lenses and uses an APS-C sized image sensor.

==Improvements==
The 20D features a new sensor and a greater megapixel count (8.2 megapixels instead of 6.3) and retains the Canon 1.6x crop factor. The 20D supports USB 2.0. The 20D has a larger buffer and can shoot more frames per second. It also uses the E-TTL II flash metering system and uses the DIGIC II image processor.

The EOS 20D (with appropriate firmware updates) can also accept the Canon Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E1/E1A for fast file transfer to a remote file server, either through an ethernet cable or a Wi-Fi network.

==Resolution==
The Canon EOS 20D has several resolution settings:
* Large/Fine (3504 x 2336 JPEG Fine)
* Large/Normal (3504 x 2336 JPEG Normal)
* Medium/Fine (2544 x 1696 JPEG Fine)
* Medium/Normal (2544 x 1696 JPEG Normal)
* Small/Fine – (1728 x 1152 JPEG Fine)
* Small/Normal (1728 x 1152 JPEG Normal)
* RAW + Large/Fine (3504 RAW + 3504 JPEG Fine)
* RAW + Large/Normal (3504 RAW + 3504 JPEG Normal)
* RAW + Medium/Fine (3504 RAW + 2544 JPEG Fine)
* RAW + Medium / Normal (3504 RAW + 2544 JPEG Normal)
* RAW + Small/Fine (3504 RAW + 1152 JPEG Fine)
* RAW + Small/Normal – (3504 RAW + 1152 JPEG Normal)
* RAW (3504 x 2336 RAW)

==Features==
The 20D is the first Canon camera to use the EF-S lens mount; the first Canon EOS camera to use the mount was the 300D (the Digital Rebel in North America).

===Creative Zone===
* &quot;A-DEP&quot;: The camera automatically selects the aperture and shutter speed to keep most of the image in focus. (Only recommended in high light conditions as the camera tends to choose smaller f/stops)
* &quot;M&quot; (Manual): The camera lets you choose manually the aperture and shutter speed.
* &quot;Av&quot; (Aperture priority): The camera lets the user choose the aperture (f/) value and then automatically adjusts the shutter speed for correct exposure.
* &quot;Tv&quot; (Shutter speed priority): The camera lets the user set the shutter speed and automatically sets the aperture for correct exposure.
* &quot;P&quot; (Program AE): The camera automatically chooses an aperture and shutter combination for correct exposure and the user can change between one of these combinations.

===Basic Zone===
* &quot;Auto&quot; (represented with a green rectangle): Completely automatic shooting.
* &quot;Portrait&quot;: The camera attempts to create a more shallow depth of field to create more striking portraits.
* &quot;Landscape&quot;: For shooting landscapes and sunsets.
* &quot;Close-Up&quot;: For shooting small objects near to the camera.
* &quot;Sports&quot;: For capturing fast moving objects.
* &quot;Night Scene&quot;: Shoots with flash and with slow shutter so that the subject is illuminated by the flash and the background (e.g. a city) is also captured naturally in the night.
* &quot;No Flash&quot;: All automatic with no flash.

==EOS 20Da==
Canon released the EOS 20Da on 14 February 2005 in Japan. It is a variant of the 20D designed for astrophotography. On 1 June 2005 Canon announced that the 20Da would be made available worldwide.

The main differences between the 20Da and 20D are the replacement of the &quot;hot mirror&quot; infra-red (IR) filter which covers the CMOS sensor on the 20D and live view mode.

In conventional photography, the IR filter is used to make the spectral response of the CMOS sensor more like that of the human eye. In this way, the pictures gathered by the sensor more closely resemble the world as we see it. In astro-photography, many objects of interest emit strongly in the red H-α line, which is heavily attenuated by the IR filter on the 20D. The IR filter of the 20Da passes 2.5 times more light at around this 656 nm wavelength as the filter of the 20D, allowing more fine detail to be revealed in long exposures of emission nebulae. As a side effect, the color balance is slightly altered in normal daylight photography.

It is extremely difficult to focus an extremely dim image with a reflex viewfinder; locking the mirror up and opening the shutter (live view) was introduced in the 20Da to address this issue. When used the camera provides a live image of the center of the field of view to allow focusing on a bright star. Live view for this application requires a lens which supports fully mechanical focus in manual mode, and is not suitable for normal daytime use.

Reviews report that image noise in the 20Da is lower than in the 20D, and equivalent to that of the 5D MkII.

The EOS 20Da was discontinued when the 30D was introduced in 2006. Canon produced no similar model for astrophotography for years, resulting in many astrophotographers making similar aftermarket modifications to later Canon models.

In April 2012, Canon announced the EOS 60Da which is the successor to the EOS 20Da.

==Firmware==
The latest firmware available for the 20D (and believed to be the final update) is version 2.0.3, made available 23 August 2005, which improves the communication reliability with some CF cards and other minor changes.

<doc id="945280" wikidata="Q840681" url="?curid=945280" title="Kinsale">
<text>Kinsale ( ; ) is a historic port and fishing town in County Cork, Ireland. Located approximately south of Cork City on the southeast coast near the Old Head of Kinsale, it sits at the mouth of the River Bandon, and has a population of 5,991 (as of the 2022 census) which increases in the summer when tourism peaks. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

Kinsale is a holiday destination for both Irish and overseas tourists. The town is known for its restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Bastion restaurant, and holds a number of annual gourmet food festivals.

As a historically strategic port town, Kinsale&#x27;s notable buildings include Desmond Castle (associated with the Earls of Desmond and also known as the French Prison) of , the 17th-century pentagonal bastion fort of James Fort on Castlepark peninsula, and Charles Fort, a partly restored star fort of 1677 in nearby Summercove. Other historic buildings include the Church of St Multose (Church of Ireland) of 1190, St John the Baptist (Catholic) of 1839, and the Market House of . Kinsale is in the Cork South-West (Dáil Éireann) constituency, which has three seats.

==History==

In January 1334, under a charter granted by King Edward III of England, the Corporation of Kinsale was established to undertake local government in the town.

The corporation existed for over 500 years until the passing of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, when local government in Kinsale was transferred to the town commissioners who had been elected in the town since 1828. These Town Commissioners became the Kinsale Council under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and the Kinsale Town Council existed until 2014 when this layer of local government was abolished in Ireland as part of measures to reduce the budget deficit following the financial crisis of 2008–2010 (see Post-2008 Irish economic downturn). It returned two members to the Irish House of Commons prior to its abolition in 1800.

In its history, Kinsale has also important occasional links with Spain. In 1518 Archduke Ferdinand, later Emperor Ferdinand I, paid an unscheduled visit to the town, during which one of his staff wrote a remarkable account of its inhabitants.
In 1601, a Spanish military expedition to Ireland – the last of the Armadas launched against the Kingdom of England – landed in Kinsale in order to link with Irish rebel forces and attack England through Ireland. As a result, the battle of Kinsale took place at the end of the Nine Years War in which English forces, led by Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, defeated the rebel Irish force, led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone and Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, two Gaelic princes from Ulster. The Irish forces were allied with the forces of King Felipe III of Spain, who was also King of Portugal and the Algarves.

In September 1607, a few years after this battle, the Flight of the Earls took place from Rathmullan in County Donegal in West Ulster in which a number of the native Irish aristocrats, including both Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone and Rory O&#x27;Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, abandoned their lands and fled to Continental Europe. Shortly after the battle, James&#x27;s Fort was built to protect the harbour. Completed by 1607, the central structure was a half-bastioned four-sided stone fortification, surrounded by pentagonal earthworks to a bastion fort or star-shaped fort design.

In 1649, Prince Rupert of the Rhine declared Charles II as King of England, Scotland and Ireland at St Multose&#x27;s Church in Kinsale upon hearing of the execution of Charles I in London by Parliamentarian forces during the English Civil War. The Virginia trading fleet made this harbour the safest destination during their wartime voyages.

Charles Fort, located at Summer Cove and dating from 1677 in the reign of Charles II, is a bastion-fort that guards the entrance to Kinsale Harbour. It was built to protect the area and specifically the harbour from the use by the French and Spanish in the event of a landing in Ireland. James&#x27;s Fort, which dates from the reign of King James VI and I, is located on the other side of the cove, on the Castlepark peninsula. An underwater chain used to be strung between the two forts across the harbour mouth during times of war to scuttle enemy shipping by ripping the bottoms out of incoming vessels.

James II landed at Kinsale in March 1689 with a force of 2,500 men, raised with the support of King Louis XIV, as part of his campaign to regain power in England, Scotland and Ireland. In 1690, James II and VII returned to exile in France from Kinsale, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne by William III of England (also &quot;Stadtholder&quot; William III of the House of Orange-Nassau) after the &#x27;Glorious Revolution&#x27; (or Revolution of 1688) in England against the background of wars involving France under King Louis XIV.

From 1694, Kinsale served as a supply base for Royal Navy vessels in southern Ireland, and a number of storehouses were built; it was limited to smaller vessels, however, due to the sandbar at the mouth of the river.

English navigator and privateer Captain Woodes Roger mentions Kinsale in the memoir of his 1708 expedition from Cork; in particular, he mentions a pair of rocks known as &#x27;the Sovereigne&#x27;s Bollacks&#x27; on which his ship almost ran aground. Kinsale&#x27;s naval significance declined after the Royal Navy moved its victualling centre from Kinsale to Cork harbour in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars in the period of France&#x27;s First Empire.

When the ocean liner RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sunk by a U-boat of the German Empire on 7 May 1915 on a voyage from New York City to Liverpool during the First World War, some of the bodies and survivors were brought to Kinsale and the subsequent inquest on the bodies recovered was held in the town&#x27;s courthouse. A statue in the harbour commemorates the effort. The Lusitania memorial is at Casement Square in Cobh, to the east of Cork city.

Kinsale was linked by a branch line via Farrangalway and Ballymartle to the Irish railway system of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway and its successors from 1863 until 1931, when the branch was closed by the Great Southern Railways during a low point in Kinsale&#x27;s economic fortunes. The station, inconveniently located for the town and harbour, was on Barrack Hill and the line ran to a junction at Crossbarry on the Cork (Albert Quay) to Bandon line.

In 2005, Kinsale became Ireland&#x27;s second Fair Trade Town, with Clonakilty being the first. Kinsale, with its &quot;electrifyingly bright streets&quot;, was rated as among the &quot;20 most beautiful villages in the UK and Ireland&quot; by &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; in 2020.

==Transport==
Bus Éireann provides Kinsale&#x27;s primary means of public transport. Buses regularly operate from Kinsale to Cork City, with most of these stopping at Cork Airport on the way. Kinsale and Bandon are linked by public transport with a bus service provided by East Cork Rural Transport.

The Archdeacon Duggan Bridge, on the R600 road to the south-west of the town, was opened in March 1977 and named after Father Tom Duggan MC OBE, a chaplain in both WWI and WWII, and later a missionary priest in Peru. This bridge replaced an older cast iron structure of the early 1880s which was located approximately upstream on the River Bandon, near Tisaxon More (&quot;Tigh Sacsan Mór&quot;).

==Education==
There are a number of primary and secondary-level schools in the area. The town&#x27;s community school was awarded &quot;Best School in the Republic of Ireland&quot; twice, as well as receiving awards at the BT Young Scientist Exhibition in 2014.

Kinsale College offers a number of further education courses, and the town also has a school of English.

==Community and sports groups==
Kinsale Yacht Club (KYC) began in 1950 and today is a sailing club that runs events for all ages of sailors and social activities throughout the year. Junior sailing includes Optimists, Lasers and 420&#x27;s. The yacht classes include Squib (keelboat), International Dragon (keelboat) and A-Class Catamaran as well as three Cruiser Classes (Class I, II and III).

Founded in 1982, the grounds of Kinsale Rugby Football Club are used for the annual Kinsale Sevens event, which attracts international teams and thousands of spectators annually.

The Kinsale GAA club plays in the Carrigdhoun division of Cork GAA. They won the Cork Football Intermediate County Championship in 2011, the first time since 1915.

Kinsale Badminton club which is affiliated with Badminton Ireland is based in St Multose Hall Kinsale. It caters to both adult and juvenile players and enters teams in Cork county Leagues and Cups.

The Kinsale Branch of the Irish Red Cross has been in existence since 1939 and is staffed by volunteers, who are present at local events and activities – including the annual Kinsale Sevens rugby event. The Kinsale Red Cross has 2 ambulances which are housed in a purpose-built building in Church Lane and crewed by trained volunteers.

Kinsale competes in the Irish Tidy Towns Competition and was the overall winner in 1986.

Kinsale is the first &#x27;Transition Town&#x27; in Ireland, and the Transition Town community organisation, supported by Kinsale town council, holds meetings locally. It has taken some guidance from the Kinsale Energy Descent Action Plan 2021, which has spawned further Transition Towns worldwide.

==Entertainment and culture==

Kinsale hosts an annual jazz festival, which takes place during the last weekend of October. Pubs and hotels in the town host concerts by jazz and blues groups throughout the weekend, including on the last Monday of October (which is a bank holiday in Ireland).

The monumental steel, originally unpainted, sculpture &quot;The Great Wall of Kinsale&quot;, by Eilis O&#x27;Connell and installed in 1988 to celebrate Kinsale&#x27;s achievements in the Tidy Towns competition, stands by Pier Road and Town Park.

Bastion, a restaurant on Market/Main streets, received a Michelin Star in 2020. Chef Keith Floyd was previously a resident of Kinsale.

==Government and politics==

The town forms part of the Bandon-Kinsale electoral district on Cork County Council and is part of the Cork South-West constituency for Dáil Éireann elections.

==Twin towns – Sister cities==
Kinsale is twinned with:
* Newport, Rhode Island, United States
* Mumbles, Wales
* Portofino, Italy

==Development==
Residential developments in the 21st century include the Convent Garden scheme near the historic centre. This development involves the conversion of the former St Josephs Convent of the Sisters of Mercy on Ramparts Lane into 79 apartments and the building of 94 houses in the grounds. After several years of inactivity, construction and sales activity recommenced in 2015 and 2016.

A further residential development, Abbey Fort, includes 260 units at the north end of Kinsale. Initial phases were completed in 2007–2012. Part of the 22-acre site at Abbey Fort was sold by the National Asset Management Agency in December 2015.

<text>Panama competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourteenth appearance at the Olympics since its debut in 1920. This team consisted of two people, a man and a woman. Panama did not compete on four occasions, including the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its partial support of the United States boycott.

Comité Olímpico de Panamá sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. A total of four athletes, three men and one woman, competed only in athletics and swimming. Freestyle swimmer, Pan American Games medalist, and three-time Olympian Eileen Coparropa reprised her role to carry the Panamanian flag in the opening ceremony for the third consecutive time since her debut, as a fifteen-year-old, in 1996.

Panama has yet to claim its first Olympic medal after the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Track star Bayano Kamani narrowly missed out on the medal podium after earning a highest result for the Panamanian team in the men&#x27;s 400 m hurdles with an astonishing fifth-place finish. 

==Athletics==

Panamanian athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

<text>Belize sent a delegation to compete at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the Central American country&#x27;s ninth appearance at a Summer Olympic Games. The delegation consisted of two track and field athletes: Michael Aguilar and Emma Wade; neither advanced beyond the first round of their events.

==Background==
The Belize Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1968. The nation made its debut in Olympic competition later that year at the 1968 Summer Olympics, and except for the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics have appeared in every Summer Olympiad since. This made Athens their ninth appearance at a Summer Olympic Games, although they have yet to appear at any Winter Olympic Games. The 2004 Summer Olympics were held from 13 to 29 August 2004; a total of 10,625 athletes participated, representing 201 National Olympic Committees. Belize sent two track and field athletes to Athens: Michael Aguilar and Emma Wade. For the opening ceremony, Wade was selected as flag-bearer.

==Athletics==
Emma Wade was 23 years old at the time of the Athens Olympics and had previously represented Belize at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. On 23 August, she participated in the first round heats of the women&#x27;s 200 meters and was drawn into heat five. She finished her heat in 23.43 seconds, fifth out of six athletes in that heat. However, only the top four in each heat plus the next four fastest from all heats could advance, and Wade was eliminated. The gold medal was eventually won in 22.05 seconds by Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica, the silver by the United States&#x27; Allyson Felix, and the bronze by Bahamian Debbie Ferguson.

Michael Aguilar was 24 years old at the time of these Olympics and was making his only Olympic appearance. On 23 August, he took part in the first round heats of the men&#x27;s 400 meter hurdles and was drawn into heat three. He finished the race in 51.21 seconds, finishing seventh and last in his heat, and he was eliminated. The gold medal was eventually won in 47.63 seconds by Félix Sánchez of the Dominican Republic, the silver medal was earned by Jamaican Danny McFarlane, and the bronze was won by Frenchman Naman Keïta.

<doc id="945299" wikidata="Q3039895" url="?curid=945299" title="Figure painting (hobby)">
<text>Figure painting, or miniature painting, is the hobby of painting miniature figures and/or model figures, either as a standalone activity or as a part of another activity that uses models, such as role-playing games, wargames, or military modeling.

In addition to the painting of models, the creation of scenic basing for the model to be affixed to is also an important part of the hobby (although not all figure painters are concerned about the basing of their models). These can range from very simple applications of textured pastes, grit, and static grass for gaming bases, to larger scenic bases for display models, and even full dioramas depicting a scene of a single model or a group of models together in tableau to create a story in one moment. It can also include aspects of sculpting, for the purpose of creating additional details for models and bases, as a means of customizing the model to make them more unique, or to create entirely scratch built models for painting. Many figure painters also paint scale busts as part of the hobby, often in bigger scales than figures with a higher level of detail, and display bases and backdrops for them.

As figure painting has grown in size and popularity as a hobby independent of miniature gaming the techniques and methods involved have been developed to advanced standards. Many online forums and online galleries have been created as places for figure painters to share their display and competition pieces for others to view and vote on, such as CoolMiniOrNot and Putty&amp;Paint, as well as figure painting conventions or figure painting events at larger tabletop gaming conventions.

==Models==

The models used for figure painting can vary greatly in materials, genres, subject matter, and style. These differences often relate to the production intention, whether the models are made purely with gaming in mind (&quot;gaming models&quot;), purely with painting and display in mind (&quot;display models&quot;), or gaming models made with consideration for painters.

===Materials===
Originally, all scale models produced were made of metal. Early models, produced for miniature wargames such as H. G. Wells &quot;Little Wars&quot;, were hollow cast and made from lead. These were not made with painting as a consideration, although could be painted to help distinguish forces and armies at a glance. Models continued to be made from metal for many decades, with the models produced by Jack Scruby, credited for the rebirth of the miniature wargaming hobby in the 1950s, being made from type metal. These would be hand sculpted in clays then cast into a mold to be used to produce copies.

Models continued to be made from lead-based white metal alloys until the early 90s. In 1993 the New York legislature banned the use of lead in miniatures following health concerns, so many model manufacturers began casting in lead-free white metal alloys as there was a widespread concern that other states would introduce similar regulations, often at higher prices. Although the legislation was eventually changed to exempt miniatures, many manufacturers continued to use the lead-free metals. As this became more widespread more manufacturers began moving away from lead metals, with lead being rarely used anymore.

Models produced in metal had limitations. The price and density of metal made producing larger models both cost and weight prohibitive. For the production of larger models sometimes parts would be cast in injection molded plastic, such as the wings of a large dragon, so that the model could stand without the need for support or risk of breaking under their own weight.

Once plastic had been introduced to miniature production, it started to become more widespread. Manufacturers began to produce models entirely in plastics as a cheaper alternative to metal. Early plastic models often lacked well defined details as the softer plastics used, such as soft PVC, held details less easily and the casting processes were less successful than the established metal casting process. For this reason metal models were, for a long time, considered superior to early plastic models.

As the casting process was refined and newer plastics were introduced the details that could be cast in plastic improved. Plastic models started to become much more common, being produced to high levels of details and sold as equivalent quality or superior quality premium product compared to metal. Many companies now produce all or the majority of their models in high quality plastics, often polystyrene. With the increase in production of plastic models the models produced could be made increasingly larger and with more details. Whilst hand sculpting a master to then cast a mold is still a common practice, it is becoming increasingly common for models to be digitally sculpted and a master 3D printed to then cast the molds from. This has greatly increased the quality of details that can be sculpted, as finer details can be included. For these higher levels of detail, plastic models have become more popular for higher standards of painting, as well as plastic models being less susceptible to flashing or casting imperfections and requiring less preparations before painting. Plastic models also allow for more options in the pose of the models as they are often sold on the sprue in pieces to be assembled, rather than a single piece of cast material. This allows for the kit to include multiple parts, as plastic is significantly cheaper than metal, that can fit together to allow multiple different variations of the model to be built, for example a kit might provide multiple different weapon options.

Despite this, metal models are still widely and commonly available as plastic casting is more cost prohibitive for smaller manufacturers. The plastic casting process is cheaper for mass production, but expensive on a small scale as the steel molds are expensive to produce and maintain, so whilst many larger manufacturers have moved from metal to plastic, many smaller manufacturers continue to use metal.

Models are also sometimes cast in polyurethane resins. Resin shares some of the advantages as plastics over metals. They are lighter, so can make larger models, can cast higher levels of details, and will often require less preparation before painting than metals. This makes resin a common choice for smaller manufacturers of larger scale models with high levels of details intended for display or competition painting, where resin casts can match the details of plastic models whilst still being affordable for smaller production lines. However, resins are often more brittle than plastics, with small details likely to break so, whilst smaller scale resin models are still produced where the productions are small, plastics are still favored by most manufacturers for smaller and mass-produced models.

===Genre, subject and style===
Models are produced in almost every genre. Due to the prominent links of production to miniature wargames the most common genres that models are made in are fantasy, sci-fi, and historical/military. The connection to wargames also means that a majority of models available are single characters (sold individually or in unit sets) in offensive or defensive poses. Within the broad genres, there is still large variation in the models produced by different manufacturers or even by the same manufacturer in different lines. For example, Games Workshop produces models for &quot;Age of Sigmar&quot; and &quot;Middle Earth SBG&quot;, both of which are fantasy settings, however the style and aesthetic of the dark fantasy Age of Sigmar is very visually distinct from the high fantasy Middle Earth SBG.

Models produced for gaming can either be generic figures or specific variations on common tropes unique to a manufacturer, for example a generic goblin figure or a licensed model sculpted to fit the unique Pathfinder goblin design. Manufacturers also often have a specific house style or aesthetic for models they produce across all lines as part of their visual identity, so models are easily recognized.

Outside of gaming models, models can vary even further. Often models are sculpted with similar subject matter, many being produced depicting sci-fi, fantasy, or historical characters in combat stances, however the restriction of models needing to fit a game&#x27;s style, setting, or scale do not exist for non-gaming models. As such, the range of genres and subjects is wider, including models of prominent non-military historical figures, figures of contemporary individuals, licensed figures of media characters, or original characters in different settings and scenarios. It is also common for display models to be sculpted as depicting a snapshot moment to tell a narrative story in tableau. As such, display models are often sculpted with a more realistic style.

It is also common for models not to depict human or humanoid characters. Many gaming systems include rules for using vehicles, such as aircraft or tanks, or mechs so there are many available gaming figures to represent these in gameplay. There are also companies that make scale kits of vehicles such as aircraft or tanks as standalone models rather than gaming pieces, such as Airfix models, however there is often a distinction made between those who paint such kits (scale modellers) and figure painters. It is also common for both gaming models and display models to depict mundane animals and fantasy creatures, either as single models or as part of a diorama set.

Some companies also produce detailed scale busts for display and competition painting. As a subset of display models, these can vary just as widely in subject and setting.

==Model sizes==
Models come in a variety of different scales. The size of full body figures is commonly given in millimeters, although the stated size of the models is not always accurate due to scale-creep, where over time models have become larger whilst still being called the same scale. For example, Games Workshop models are still stated as being 28mm scale, however over years of production the size has crept up and they&#x27;re now closer to 32mm scale. The size of busts is almost exclusively given as a ratio scale rather than in millimeters.

The most commonly found full model scale is 28mm scale as this is the most common scale used by gaming companies in recent years, although these models can be closer to 32mm scale or even 35mm scale due to scale-creep. Additional to scale-creep, often models that are sold and marketed as being a 28mm scale have anatomical features such as hands and heads that are out of proportion with the rest of the model. Originally a result of limitations fine details in metal, this is commonly done as a stylistic choice to create a more imposing or impressive looking character, referred to as &quot;heroic&quot; scale. Models made to be exactly in scale are referred to as &quot;true&quot; scale. Heroic scale and scale-creep are more common in sci-fi and fantasy models than historical or military war game models, although true scale models can still sometimes suffer from heroic proportions.

Other common scales for models are 54mm and 72mm. These are less common as few games use models this big. Companies that make models in these sizes are often independent producers of models intended to be display models. As these models do not often get used for games they do not often suffer from scale creep. The larger scale offers more opportunity for higher levels of detail that would otherwise be impossible to cast in smaller scales, as well as the larger size offering more physical space to include such details. Due to their larger size and higher levels of detail these are often the scales of choice for competition painters, where size restrictions allow them.

For busts, the most common scales are 1:12 scale and 1:10 scale. These provide enough size to allow for sufficient detail, without being so large that the cast shadow of the sculpt onto itself interferes with the painting, as would happen with larger scales. As there is less prevalence of scale-creep in busts, and the larger size would make a heroic scale obvious and unnatural looking, many bust manufacturers have begun to include the upper torso and arms, as well as any held objects such as weapons, or even the whole torso from the waist up, as opposed to a more traditional bust of just the shoulders up. This is to increase the size of the models for additional visual interest and the physical surface area for additional details, and is most common with companies that produce busts specifically as display models or as competition pieces.

==Paints==
Many different types of paints can be used for figure painting to achieve different effects and finishes. Originally, enamel paints, such as Testors and Humbrol, were almost exclusively used for figure painting as these were all that was widely available. These provided strong colors, were able to adhere well to the metal models of the time, as well as later plastic models, and the long drying time of 12–24 hours meant they were able to self level to a smooth finish. However, enamel paints also has some properties that many figure painters find undesirable. These include the need for specialist thinners for thinning and brush cleaning, limitations on techniques that can be used compared to other paint types, the long drying time making painting highlights and shadows a longer process, and the requirement to paint outside or in well ventilated areas due to toxic fumes that the paints give off.
 Whilst still popular in scale modelling communities, the disadvantages of enamel paints compared to other paint types has caused them to become less popular among figure painters, especially those who paint to advanced standards.
As acrylic paints began to become more widely available, companies began making acrylic paints that were formulated specifically for figure painting, characterized by being thinner than artist acrylic paints, with more flow, and having higher pigment density and more finely ground pigment than cheaper craft acrylics. These include companies that only make paints and paint related products, such as Acrylicos Vallejo&#x27;s &quot;Model Color&quot; and &quot;Game Color&quot; lines, companies that make paints to supplement gaming model lines, such as Games Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Citadel Colour&quot; paints, and companies that make paints to supplement display model lines, such as Scale75&#x27;s &quot;Scalecolor&quot; paints. Thin medium acrylic paints are most common, however some companies also make gel consistency medium based acrylic paints, such as &quot;Warcolour&quot; paints. The major benefits of acrylic paints over enamel paints are the faster drying time, that acrylics can be thinned with water, that various mediums and additives (e.g. retarders, surfactants, etc.) can be mixed in to assist in painting, that multiple thinned and semi-transparent layers of paint can be used to create blending and effects, and being non-toxic. For all of their advantages, acrylic paints are the most popular choice among figure painters, with the majority of painters, particularly display and competition painters, using exclusively acrylic or mostly acrylic with some other paint types used for achieving specific effects, although some figure painters still use enamels out of personal preference or nostalgia. As well as acrylic paints formulated for figure painting, it is possible to use regular &quot;heavy body&quot; acrylics to achieve highly detailed results, provided they are of a high artist grade quality.

Oil paints can also be used for figure painting. The slow drying time allows for painting wet-on-wet, commonly called wetblending by figure painters, to produce smooth blends of color and value. When using oil paints for figure painting it is usual to first apply a coat of acrylic paint to provide a starting color foundation, followed by a coat of a gloss or matte varnish to avoid the risk of oil thinners stripping the acrylic. Using oil paints in this way to paint entire models is much less common than acrylic paints, although is popular among display painters who specialize in historical models, and is often considered a more advanced method compared to acrylic paints. A more common use for oil paints in figure painting is to paint the model with acrylics then use thinned down oil paint to apply oil washes for shading.

Other paint types can be used, but are much less common. Lacquer paints can be used for applying fast drying and very hard wearing, chip and scratch resistant coats of paint through an airbrush, but are even more toxic than enamels so are not widely used. Watercolors can be used for weathering effects as they can create dust or dirt effects quickly and can be reactivated with water to remove excess, such as for pinwashing, although these cannot be easily used to paint the full model and require sealing with a varnish after application.

==Tools==
===Preparation===
It is common for models to require some preparation before they can be painted and a variety of tools can be used for this. Plastic and resin models will often need to be removed from the sprue. This can be done with a hobby knife or a pair of small scissors, although many companies make specialized &quot;hobby clippers&quot; to make cutting easier and more flush to model pieces. It may also be necessary to remove flash on model parts, which can be done with a hobby knife or &quot;mold line removers&quot; that some companies make. Once the model pieces are cleaned they are glued together with cyanoacrylate super-glues or, for plastic models, plastic cement. Pinning may also be necessary. Once assembled it may be necessary to remove excess glue or smooth the model&#x27;s surface with small files or fine grit sandpaper and any gaps from where the pieces do not fit flush together filled with an epoxy putty, such as &quot;Milliput&quot;. Once the model is fully prepared primer can be applied if needed.

===Painting===
Brushes used for figure painting vary by the type of paint used and techniques employed. For paints that require specific chemical thinners, such as enamels, lacquers, and oils, synthetic fiber brushes are often recommended for longer life as the thinners can cause natural fibers to deteriorate over time, although natural bristle brushes are often used for finer details. For acrylic paints that can be thinned with water there is less concern about bristle deterioration. Many acrylic painters consider kolinsky sable watercolor brushes to be the best quality brushes for painting, as they offer a great deal of control over the flow of paint and a sharp, precise tip for painting fine details. Brush sizes can vary depending on the task. Some painters use extremely small brushes for painting the very fine details of a model. When working with slow drying paints such as enamels this can be true as the smaller brush sizes can produce finer lines more easily. However, when working with fast drying acrylics the small amounts of paint in a small size brush can dry quickly in the bristles, damaging the brush and making painting difficult, so many highly skilled display and competition painters advise against small brushes, instead recommending using larger brushes that have very finely pointed tips, such as kolinsky sable brushes, for precise and detailed painting.

Airbrushes are also a commonly used tool for figure painting. An airbrush can be used to apply primer, either single color or zenithally, basecoats, and varnish quickly across large areas, as well as finer detail work such as creating color or value gradients and applying tints or glazes to large areas. For fine detail work smaller needle sizes are preferred, although larger needle sizes are preferred to speed up less detailed applications. Gravity-feed airbrushes are preferred over side- or bottom-feed as there is less paint wastage, and dual-action is often preferred over single-action as it provides greater spray control.

A palette is used to thin and mix paints. Thinning paints when figure painting is essential as the small details can easily become clogged up with thickly applied paint. Any non-porous material, such as a ceramic tile, can be used as a palette and many hobbying companies sell wet palettes and palette paper pads. Many figure painters who work in acrylic use wet palettes to keep their paints from drying out too quickly during a painting session. These are often homemade from household supplies, however some use commercial ones made by art supply manufacturers or wet palettes made by hobby companies specially for figure painting.

==Competition==

Many competitions for figure painting exist for painters to take part in at a variety of levels.

Many miniature hobbying stores and gaming stores host small scale competitions where local patrons can compete, either for simply the title of winning or prizes, such as products or store vouchers, either held as a regular standalone event or as part of a larger special event. These can be judged by popular vote of attendees or judged by the store employees or other external judges, such as a highly regarded painter local to the area. Such competitions can vary widely in quality standard depending on the standard of local painters. It is common for these competitions to have a small number of categories, such a single model and unit, or to have a single theme, such as &quot;large monster&quot; or &quot;Paint Your Hero&quot;, and often with a distinction between adult and youth entries.

There are also many large scale competitions held internationally for painters of an advanced skill level, either held as standalone events or as part of larger gaming conventions. These are often either sponsored or organized by gaming companies or miniature companies, such as the &quot;Resin Beast&quot; competition hosted by Creature Caster at AdeptiCon or the &quot;Golden Demon&quot; competition organized by Games Workshop at their annual Warhammer Fest event, although they are also sometimes independently organized by the conventions themselves. Competitions often have multiple categories to enter in. Some common categories seen at many competitions include Single Figure, Diorama, Unit, and Vehicle, often further subcategorized by genre, such as fantasy, sci-fi, and historical, and an &quot;anything goes&quot; Open category without size, subject matter, or entrant restrictions is also common. These events often attract painters from around the world who wish to compete at the highest level. Competitions can be judged as either a &quot;traditional&quot; style judging system or an &quot;open&quot; style scoring system. In traditional judging systems entries are given a first cut to finalists with a surface observation by judges, then the finalist entries are inspected more closely to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in each category, often with commended entries being given out to entries that were close to placing. In the open system of judging entries are scored in a number of different areas, such as technical skill or composition, and the total score for each entry determines what award it is given, often titled Bronze, Silver, and Gold. In such a competition there is no restriction on how many entries can be given each award – hypothetically an award might have no entries given out for it or all entries might achieve Gold if all entries are of an extremely high level. Many competitions also give an award for the piece judged Best in Show, such as the Slayer Sword prize in Golden Demon. Another style of judging is a combined system, where entries are ranked by popular online vote and in person judging. Large scale painting competitions offer a variety of prizes, such as products produced by the sponsor company, a cash prize, or simply a title and trophy or other object, such as the winner of the Slayer Sword at Golden Demon being awarded a physical sword in place of a trophy.

There are also a number of online only competitions, where painters submit photos of their painted models into different categories which are then voted on by popular vote. Sometimes the popular vote informs a final cut, which is then judged by a professional judging panel, such as with Games Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Everchosen&quot; competition where each Games Workshop store and some independent hobby stores hosted small local competitions, where the winners for each store were uploaded to the Everchosen webpage for public vote with the top 100 being then reviewed by a professional judging panel to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd winners.

<doc id="945302" wikidata="Q1131411" url="?curid=945302" title="James Taylor (album)">
<text>James Taylor is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor. Released on December 6, 1968, it was the first recording by a non-British artist released by Apple Records, and would also be Taylor&#x27;s only release on that label. The album was released under the title First Album on the South African market.

==Background==
The album was produced by Peter Asher, who was A&amp;R head for The Beatles&#x27; newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor recorded the album from July to October 1968 at Trident Studios, at the same time as the Beatles were recording the White Album. Trident was the most technologically advanced studio in England at the time and was in high demand; some session time booked by The Beatles was used instead to record Taylor&#x27;s album. Paul McCartney and Peter Asher brought in arranger Richard Hewson to add orchestrations to several of the songs and unusual &quot;link&quot; passages in between them; these would receive a mixed reception at best.

==Songs==
Notable songs include &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot;, &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day Man&quot;. McCartney and an uncredited George Harrison guested on bass and backing vocals respectively on &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot;, the lyric of which, &quot;holy host of others standing around me&quot;, made reference to The Beatles, while the title phrase of Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot; provided the starting point for Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Something&quot;. (Coincidentally, Taylor has said he had meant for the song to be called &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; – after a dominant line in the chorus – but the title had already been taken by a Beatles song.) Taylor also recorded a very early version of &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, which would be his breakthrough hit on his second album, but Asher did not choose it for the album release.

==Release and reception==
The album was released by Apple Records On December 6, 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the US. Critical reaction was generally good, including a very positive Jon Landau review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot; that said &quot;this album is the coolest breath of fresh air I&#x27;ve inhaled in a good long while. It knocks me out.&quot; The record&#x27;s commercial potential suffered from Taylor&#x27;s inability to promote it due to his hospitalization for drug addiction and it sold poorly. &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; b/w &quot;Something&#x27;s Wrong&quot; was released as a single in the UK (APPLE 32) in February 1969, but failed to chart. It was released as a single in the US (Apple 1805) in March 1969, but reached only number 118. &quot;Knocking &#x27;Round the Zoo&quot; was issued as a single in France (APF 506) backed with &quot;Something&#x27;s Wrong&quot;.

Because of difficulties in obtaining licensing rights from Apple during the 1970s, &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot; and &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; were re-recorded in 1976 for Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.

&quot;Rainy Day Man&quot; was re-recorded in 1979 for Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Flag&quot; album.

<text>Since the beginning of liberalism in Portugal in the 19th century, several parties have, by gaining representation in parliament, continued the liberal ideology in contemporary Portuguese politics. But after the initial fervor of the Liberal Revolution of 1820 and the outcome of the Liberal Wars (1828–1834) during the 19th century, liberalism was relegated to a secondary role in Portuguese politics and government and even outlawed for periods of time. The first fully-fledged liberal party (a political party professing classical liberalism including pro-market, business-friendly economic liberalism, small government and individual freedom as core tenets of its ideology) founded as such to have a seat in the Portuguese Parliament since the end of the First Portuguese Republic (1910–1926), was the Liberal Initiative, in 2019.

==History==
===1826 to 1926===

====From Democratic Group to New Progressive Party====
*1826: Supporters of the liberal revolution of 1820 establish the Democratic Group (&quot;Grupo Democrata&quot;)
*1840: The party is reorganized into the Progress Party (&quot;Partido do Progresso&quot;), founded by João de Saldanha
*1849: The New Progressive Party merges with the conservative Regenerator Party (&quot;Partido Regenerador&quot;)
*1851: A faction leaves the party and founds the Progressive Historical Party/Party of Historical Progressives (Partido Progressista Histórico/Partido dos Progressistas Históricos)
*1862: The Progressive Historical Party is split into the Reformist Party and the Historical Party (&quot;Partido Histórico&quot;)
*1876: Both parties reunite and merge into the New Progressive Party (&quot;Novo Partido Progressista&quot;), which eventually develops into a Conservative party
*1910: The New Progressive Party dissolves.

====Portuguese Republican Party====
*1872: Revolutionary and radical liberals establish the Portuguese Republican Party (&quot;Partido Republicano Português&quot;)
*1891: The Portuguese Republican Party is banned.
*1906: It is reestablished.
*1910: The newly radicalized party stages a revolution and its leader Joaquim Teófilo Braga becomes Prime Minister of Portugal.
*1911: Liberal and moderate factions of the Portuguese Republican Party (Partido Republicano Português) form the Republican National Union (União Nacional Republicano) which secedes.
*1912: The Republican National Union is split and liberals establish the Evolutionist Republican Party (Partido Republicano Evolucionista), led by António José de Almeida. The conservative wing in the split continues as the Republican Union. The radical remains of the Portuguese Republican Party rebranded themselves as Democratic Party (Partido Democrático).
*1919: The Republican Union and the Evolutionist Republican Party merged into the conservative Republican Liberal Party(&quot;Partido Republicano Liberal&quot;) and the liberals form the Popular Portuguese Party (Partido Português Popular)
*1920: The National Reconstituted Republican Party secedes, leaving the Portuguese Republican Party as an intransigent radical, such as the Jacobine party which is banned in 1926. Liberal elements from the Portuguese Republican Party form the National Reconstituted Republican Party (&quot;Partido Republicano Reconstituente Nacional&quot;)
*1922: The Portuguese Republic Party is renamed Radical Party (Partido Radical)
*1923: The Republican Action Party was merged into the conservative Nationalist Republican Party (&quot;Partido Republicano Nacionalista&quot;), but later that year it is refounded as the Republican Action (&quot;Acção Republicana&quot;) 
*1925: Left-wing dissidents of the Republican Party/Democratic Party formed the Democratic Leftwing Republican Party (Partido Republicano Esquerdista Democrático) and the Reformist Party.
*1926: The Republic Action Party is banned.

===1985 onwards===
====Social Democratic Party====

Francisco Sá Carneiro became a member of the Portuguese National Assembly in 1969 under the Estado Novo dictatorial regime (1933-1974) and, in turn, one of the leaders of the &quot;Liberal Wing&quot; (&quot;Ala Liberal&quot;) of the National Assembly (the Portuguese legislature during the Estado Novo regime) which attempted to work for the gradual transformation of António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s dictatorship into a Western European liberal democracy. In May 1974, a month after the Carnation Revolution, Sá Carneiro and others founded the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) the original name of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). The Social Democratic Party was a full right member of the Liberal International, from 1985 until 1996. The party leaned towards economic liberalism since Aníbal Cavaco Silva served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1985 to 1995 (a period marked by high economic growth in the country) and later as President of Portugal from 2006 to 2016. From June 2011 to November 2015, after a IMF-European Union orchestrated bailout to the insolvent Portuguese Republic has been requested by the incumbent Prime Minister José Sócrates of the Socialist Party on 6 April 2011, Pedro Passos Coelho of the Social Democratic Party served as Prime Minister and his policies and proposals, in accordance with the recommendations made by the European troika to the Portuguese Republic, were regarded by the left as aligned with economic liberalism after decades of left-leaning, labor movement-inspired policies enacted by Portuguese socialist politicians and their political allies before the ultimate signals of financial collapse of the Republic arose in 2010. However, many of Pedro Passos Coelho cabinet&#x27;s proposals from 2011 to 2015 didn&#x27;t pass due to the anti-liberal, labor movement-inspired Portuguese law.

====Social Liberal Movement====
* 2005: The Social Liberal Movement (Movimento Liberal Social, MLS) is founded as a movement (not a political party). The current president is Miguel Duarte.

====Liberal Initiative====

* 2017: The Liberal Initiative, a classical liberal party, is founded and becomes a full member of the ALDE European Party. In 2019, its debut year at the Portuguese legislative elections, the party won one seat in the Portuguese Parliament. The party supported its first government coalition, at regional level, after the 2020 Azorean regional election. IL is, similarly to most alike European liberal parties, closest to the right-wing libertarianism and centre-right British notion of classical liberalism, following a reverse notion of that same base-ideology of left-wing liberalism in North America. The party won 30 seats in municipal councils in its first ever local elections. In the 2022 legislative election, the party added seven new seats in the Portuguese Parliament for a total of eight MPs.

==== Democracia 21 ====

* 2018: Democracia 21 (D21) was founded. Sofia Afonso Ferreira became its leader.

<doc id="945305" wikidata="Q770965" url="?curid=945305" title="Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (film)">
<text>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a 2002 American biographical spy film depicting the fictional life of game show host and producer Chuck Barris. The film was George Clooney&#x27;s directorial debut, was written by Charlie Kaufman and starred Sam Rockwell as Barris, as well as Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, and Clooney. It is based on Barris&#x27;s 1984 &quot;unauthorized autobiography&quot; of the same name, in which he claimed to have been an assassin for the CIA in addition to his show business career. These allegations have been denied by the CIA, while Barris throughout his life generally refused to say whether the claim was true or not.

The film had a long development process. Columbia Pictures briefly planned to produce a film adaptation in the late 1980s, to be directed by Jim McBride. The film rights were purchased in 1997 by producer Andrew Lazar, who hired Kaufman to write a screenplay; the project then quickly attracted a string of well-known directors, including David Fincher, Brian De Palma and Bryan Singer, and lead actors, including Mike Myers, Ben Stiller and Johnny Depp. When Clooney was hired to direct, he brought on Barris to consult on the project in order to provide additional authenticity. This in turn led to (uncredited) rewrites on the script, which Kaufman was unhappy with, including the removal of a drug addiction subplot. Clooney also championed the casting of Rockwell, who at that point was mostly unknown. To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Barrymore and Roberts to lower their salaries.

The film was released to favorable reviews from critics but performed poorly at the box office. Rockwell, in particular, was praised for his acting and won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival.

==Plot==
Tired of being rejected by the beautiful women he lusts after, Chuck Barris moves to Manhattan to become an NBC page with dreams of becoming famous in television but is eventually fired. He moves back to Philadelphia and becomes Dick Clark&#x27;s personal assistant on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in 1961. He writes the successful song &quot;Palisades Park&quot; and becomes romantically involved with a woman named Penny Pacino. Chuck is given permission to pitch the concept for &quot;The Dating Game&quot; at ABC. He is given $7,500 to create a television pilot, but ABC abandons the idea in favor of &quot;Hootenanny&quot;.

One night after Barris is kicked out of a bar for fighting, he is approached by CIA agent Jim Byrd, who recruits him as an assassin. Returning from a mission in Mexico, Barris finds that Penny has become a hippie. Meanwhile, ABC green-lights &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, and by 1967 the show is a phenomenon.

On a CIA mission in Helsinki, Finland, he meets female operative Patricia Watson. He finds more success back home when &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; goes on air. He and Penny decide to move to Los Angeles, but Barris is cautious of marriage, much to Penny&#x27;s dismay. In 1970, Byrd convinces Barris to go on a mission to West Berlin to assassinate Hans Colbert. Barris is introduced to German-American agent Keeler, whom he helps to kill Colbert. However, he is captured by the KGB and, after some weeks, freed during a west–east spy exchange.

In 1976, Barris creates &quot;The Gong Show,&quot; becoming famous as its host. Keeler is murdered and Byrd warns Barris of a mole in the agency. His TV shows are canceled due to poor ratings, and Penny threatens to leave after catching him cheating. One night, Barris finds Byrd sitting atop the diving board of his backyard pool. Byrd reveals why he was chosen by the CIA to become an assassin: he is the son of a serial killer and had been raised as a girl by his mother, so he &quot;fit the profile&quot;. Barris threatens Byrd and, moments later, Byrd is revealed to have died while still sitting on the diving board.

Faced with the unpleasant truth about himself, Barris begins to spiral out of control. After almost having a nervous breakdown on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, Barris shuts himself away in a New York City hotel. Penny finds him and tries in vain to convince him to return to California to get married.

Barris finally leaves his room to meet Patricia in Boston. After a cup of coffee, Barris collapses, seemingly poisoned. Patricia reveals that she is the mole. Barris has tricked Patricia into drinking from the poisoned cup, and she falls dead. After her death, he returns home and begins writing his autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;. He finally decides to marry Penny. At the end of the ceremony, Barris sees some of the people he killed in the crowd. Distraught, he confesses to Penny his double life as a CIA assassin, but she merely laughs, assuming he is joking, and Barris decides not to correct Penny.

==Cast==
Barris, Dick Clark, Jim Lange, Murray Langston, Jaye P. Morgan, and Gene Patton are featured in interviews central to the storyline.

==Production==
===Development===

Chuck Barris first sold the film rights of his &quot;unauthorized autobiography&quot; to Columbia Pictures in the late 1980s. Columbia president Dawn Steel greenlighted &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; with Jim McBride directing. McBride offered the lead role to Richard Dreyfuss, who refused to read the script because he believed Barris&#x27;s morbid humor was distasteful. The project was abandoned at Columbia when Steel was fired in 1989. Producer Andrew Lazar optioned the film rights from Columbia in 1997 and set &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; at Warner Bros. Pictures that same year. Charlie Kaufman entered discussions to write a new screenplay in June 1997 and finished his first draft later that year. Barris gave positive feedback to Kaufman&#x27;s script and Curtis Hanson instantly agreed to direct with Sean Penn in the lead role and George Clooney and Drew Barrymore attached to co-star.

Hanson eventually dropped out, but with the financial success of &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), P. J. Hogan entered discussions with Warner Bros. to direct in January 1998. Mike Myers signed on to replace Sean Penn, who vacated the lead role. However, negotiations with Hogan fell through; Sam Mendes, David Fincher and Darren Aronofsky all became interested in taking over the director&#x27;s position. Fincher and Myers were ing production for &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; in April 2000 but Fincher dropped out and, by that October, Brian De Palma was attached to direct with Renaissance Pictures co-financing. Later that month, Warner Bros. put the project in turnaround, and Myers lost interest. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Edward Norton had also been attached to the film in the early development stages.

In December 2000, Ben Stiller was in discussions to star as Chuck Barris, with Bryan Singer directing and Clooney still aboard. However, Stiller was forced to vacate &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001). Although Singer was interested in Sam Rockwell in the lead role, the director cast Johnny Depp to replace Stiller and commenced pre-production in January 2001 on a planned $35 million budget. Renaissance Pictures was holding international distribution rights, but the filmmakers still needed more financing as well as a studio to cover distribution duties in the United States.

Grosvenor Park was interested in co-financing with Renaissance, but the next month (February 2001), &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was once again stalled in development. Miramax Films had been negotiating for domestic rights, but difficulties arose when Miramax also wanted to cover international rights. Renaissance was also unable to close the financing in time to accommodate both the &quot;production insurance&quot; deadline and the 65-day shooting schedule, which was set to primarily take place in Montreal and British Columbia, Canada. Artisan Entertainment then became interested in covering North American distribution rights but dropped out after the bid went over $8 million. Johnny Depp eventually went to work on other films.

===Director===
With Singer busy preparing &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was rejuvenated with Clooney taking over as director. Miramax Films agreed to cover distribution duties and co-finance the film. In the end, funding for &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; came from Miramax, Clooney&#x27;s own Section Eight Productions, Village Roadshow Pictures, producer Andrew Lazar&#x27;s Mad Chance, Allied Filmmakers, and The Kushner-Locke Company. Clooney explained, &quot;I thought if I came on board as a director, for scale, and was able to bring everybody else on inexpensively, if I could get the film back down to $30 million, then I was going to be able to get the film made. That was a big part of my pitch to Harvey Weinstein at Miramax.&quot;

Because &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was his directing debut, Clooney took inspiration from friends Steven Soderbergh and the Coen brothers for his filmmaking style. Writer Charlie Kaufman said he was dissatisfied with the way Clooney treated the screenplay. &quot;I spent a lot of time working on the script,&quot; he explained, &quot;but I don&#x27;t think he was interested in the things I was interested in. I&#x27;ve moved on and I don&#x27;t have any animosity towards Clooney, but it&#x27;s a movie I don&#x27;t really relate to.&quot; Clooney acknowledged that Kaufman&#x27;s original script contained &quot;really funky scenes that would never reach the green light of being a studio film.&quot; A drug addiction subplot was removed based on Barris&#x27;s request for historical authenticity.

Clooney was adamant that Barris become heavily involved during production in an attempt to portray the film from his point of view. Barris was so enthusiastic with Clooney&#x27;s work on the film that he began writing &quot;Bad Grass Never Dies&quot; (), the sequel to &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;; Miramax also owns the film rights to &quot;Bad Grass&quot;. Barris filmed cameo appearances of himself during the shoot in Canada and taped a voice-over in Clooney&#x27;s house.

When asked about Barris&#x27;s claim of being a CIA assassin, Clooney commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how much I believed it. I didn&#x27;t want to officially ask him, because I didn&#x27;t want him to say, &#x27;I made it up.&#x27; I wanted to tell the story and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that&#x27;s what we wanted to do with the film.&quot; (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, &quot;3&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. &quot;My father had a game show when I was growing up called &quot;The Money Maze&quot;. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them,&quot; the director reflected, &quot;and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it.&quot;

===Casting===
Casting the lead role of Barris was a long, difficult process. &quot;After two months of screen tests and everything I still wasn&#x27;t able to get Sam Rockwell,&quot; Clooney reflected. Rockwell had always been Clooney&#x27;s first choice ever since they worked together on &quot;Welcome to Collinwood&quot; (2002). Both Clooney and Barris also believed Rockwell shared an uncanny resemblance to Barris. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want someone too famous to play the role,&quot; the director reasoned. &quot;In my opinion, you cannot have famous people playing famous people. It doesn&#x27;t work. Sam was the guy for the part, ready to break and hadn&#x27;t yet.&quot;

Prior to his audition, Rockwell &quot;immersed&quot; himself in the role by watching episodes of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; in an attempt to impress the filmmakers. &quot;I went to LA [and] did an old-fashioned screen test, like a real Scarlett O&#x27;Hara-type screen test, which you know they don&#x27;t really do anymore,&quot; the actor remembered. For research, Rockwell spent two and a half months with Barris. &quot;We went to coffee shops and dinner and movies, took walks, went to the zoo; I even filmed him,&quot; Rockwell explained. &quot;I had him tape my lines in a tape recorder, and I listened to that to get his voice down.&quot;

Clooney cast Julia Roberts as the mysterious CIA agent Patricia Watson due to their positive working relationship in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001). Her role was originally set for Nicole Kidman, who dropped out over scheduling conflicts with &quot;The Hours&quot;. After Rockwell&#x27;s casting, &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was once again briefly postponed; Miramax did not greenlight the film until Roberts signed on. Clooney commented, &quot;Julia really helped me. Her doing the part made it possible for me to cast Sam Rockwell. He can&#x27;t drive a $28 million film, but Julia certainly can.&quot; Renée Zellweger and Gwyneth Paltrow were considered for the Penny Pacino role, which eventually went to Drew Barrymore.

Miramax was unsure of Clooney&#x27;s decision to cast Rockwell over other famous actors such as Robert Downey Jr., and Ben Stiller. Clooney convinced the studio into giving him the right of final cut privilege and casting Rockwell in exchange for first-look deals on &quot;Full Frontal&quot; (2002) and other low-budget films from Clooney&#x27;s Section Eight Productions. Clooney also agreed to cameo in Miramax&#x27;s &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot; (2003) so Rockwell could be cast. To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Roberts and Barrymore to lower their asking prices.

===Filming===
Under Clooney&#x27;s direction, filming was initially set to begin in September 2001, but principal photography did not start until January 14, 2002. From January to March 2002, production for &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; took place primarily in California and Montreal. The Playboy Mansion scene was shot in early April at Los Angeles, California; the remaining two weeks of production took place around the Mexico – United States border. Filming for &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; ended in late April 2002.

Clooney and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel used various techniques when portraying the different decades of Barris&#x27;s life. &quot;We thought in order to go back in time, most people remember things through film,&quot; Clooney reasoned. &quot;I don&#x27;t remember the 1950s – I wasn&#x27;t around for them – I know the 50s through Technicolor. Not Technicolor as it was shot, but Technicolor as it has faded now.&quot; The filmmakers studied various films and magazine issues of that decade for inspiration on the color palette. Racking focuses were highly stylized for scenes set in the 1960s, similar to the Spaghetti Westerns of that era. Hand-held cameras were used for scenes set in the 1970s, an homage to the films of Sidney Lumet, Mike Nichols and Alan J. Pakula, primarily &quot;Klute&quot; (1971), &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974). Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;All That Jazz&quot; also influenced Clooney&#x27;s direction.

Clooney commented that post-production for &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was stressful because he was simultaneously acting in &quot;Solaris&quot; (2002).

==Reception==
===Release===
To tie in with the release of the film, Miramax Books republished Barris&#x27;s 1984 book. The film premiered out-of-competition at the May 2002 Cannes Film Festival before Miramax Films gave it a limited release in the United States on December 31, 2002; the wide release came on January 24, 2003. The film only barely recouped its production costs, grossing only $33.01 million, of which $16 million was domestic revenue and $17.01 million came from foreign markets. It was released on VHS and DVD in September 2003. The DVD includes over 20 minutes of deleted scenes, Rockwell&#x27;s three screen tests, a short documentary titled &quot;The Real Chuck Barris&quot;, Clooney&#x27;s audio commentary, and a making-of featurette.

===Critical response===
The film received positive responses from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Rockwell is spot-on as Barris, and Clooney directs with entertaining style and flair.&quot; On &quot;Metacritic&quot;, the film has a weighted average score of 67/100, based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 10, 2003. Sam Rockwell won the Silver Bear for Best Actor and George Clooney was nominated the Golden Bear but lost to Michael Winterbottom of &quot;In This World&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; a positive review, awarding it 3 out of 4 stars. &quot;George Clooney&#x27;s directorial debut is not only intriguing as a story but great to look at,&quot; Ebert said, &quot;a marriage of bright pop images from the 1960s and 1970s and dark, cold spyscapes that seem to have wandered in from John le Carré.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote that the film carried a perfect balance of dark humor and psychological drama. &quot;Clooney tackles a far-reaching absurdist fantasy with Barris as a paradigm of paranoia,&quot; Travers reviewed. &quot;He wisely hooks up with talent he worked with as an actor: cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, from &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), and editor Stephen Mirrione from &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001).&quot;

Mick LaSalle from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;there may be more entertaining and less problematic movies, but &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; has something about it that hangs in there, working on the mind like a dog gnawing on a table leg. The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I&#x27;m not sure &quot;Confessions&quot; is a good movie, but I am sure I like it.&quot; Owen Gleiberman, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, observed that &quot;Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn&#x27;t really have the look, or aura, of a movie star,&quot; Glieberman stated. &quot;He&#x27;s more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he&#x27;s been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave a negative review. He disliked the characterization of Chuck Barris and commented that &quot;with its multiplicity of over-stylized looks and slick gimmicks, &quot;Dangerous Mind&quot; was doubtless more stimulating to direct than it will be for audiences to experience.&quot; Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote a mixed critique. &quot;George Clooney is eager to show how much he has learned at the hands of the A-list filmmakers he has toiled under. So we get a style that is about 50% Steven Soderbergh and 50% Coen brothers. Sometimes it works, but mostly it comes across as too artsy, with all sorts of bizarre angles and unusual shots.&quot;

==Series adaptation==
In April 2021, a drama series adaptation was reported to be in development at Apple TV+, who won the auction for the script. David Hollander and Jon Worley are signed on as showrunners and executive producers, while Justin Timberlake is attached to play Chuck Barris. Miramax and Paramount Television Studios (now CBS Studios) will produce the series.

<doc id="945316" wikidata="Q3776188" url="?curid=945316" title="Greatest Hits (James Taylor album)">
<text>Greatest Hits is the first greatest hits album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor, released in November 1976 by Warner Bros. records. It remains Taylor&#x27;s best-selling album, with over 11 million units being sold in the United States, making it among the best-selling albums of the 1970&#x27;s.

The album took place in the context of Taylor&#x27;s end of his recording contract with Warner Records. It features redone versions of &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; and &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot;, both of which had been previously included on Taylor&#x27;s self-titled debut album in 1968. It also includes a previously unavailable live version of &quot;Steamroller&quot;.

The album did not rise higher than number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart on its original release. However it became a steady seller for many years, and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; has sold over 11 million copies, certifying it as an 11× Platinum album

In August 2012, the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, at number 15, which gave the album a new peak.

==Reception==
Music critic William Ruhlmann gave the album a positive review, writing for AllMusic that it constitutes a &quot;reasonable collection for an artist who wasn&#x27;t particularly well-defined by his singles&quot;. While cautioning that the release did not quite show the &quot;evolution&quot; of Taylor&#x27;s songwriting, he stated that it remains &quot;a good sampler&quot; of the artist&#x27;s early work.

<doc id="945319" wikidata="Q722913" url="?curid=945319" title="Polans (eastern)">
<text>The Polans or Polians (; ; ; ), also known as Polanians, Polianians, and Eastern Polans, were an East Slavic tribe between the 6th and the 9th century, which inhabited both sides of the Dnieper river from Liubech to Rodnia and also down the lower streams of the rivers Ros&#x27;, Sula, Stuhna, Teteriv, Irpin&#x27;, Desna and Pripyat.

The distinct western Polans of the Early Middle Ages were a West Slavic tribe, ancestors of the Poles.
==History==
The name derives from the Old East Slavic word &quot;поле&quot; &quot;(romanized: pole)&quot;, which means &quot;field&quot;, because, according to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; they lived in the fields (). At one stage the Polanians were subjugated by the Khazars.

The land of the Polans was at the crossroads of important trade and territories inhabited by different Eastern Slavic tribes (such as the Drevlians, Radimichs, Drehovians and Severians) and connected them all with water arteries. An important trade route, the Road from the Varangians to the Greeks, passed along the Dnieper through the land of the Polans and connected Northern Europe with the Black Sea and the Byzantine Empire. Geographic location of the Polans allowed them to play an organisational role in consolidation of the East Slavic tribes. In the 9th and 10th centuries the Polans conducted well-developed arable land farming, cattle-breeding, hunting, fishing, wild-hive beekeeping and various handicrafts such as blacksmithing, casting, pottery, goldsmithing, etc. Thousands of (pre-Polan) kurgans, found by archaeologists in the Polan region, indicate that that land could support a relatively high population density. The Polans lived in small families in semi dug-outs (&quot;earth-houses&quot;) and wore homespun clothes and modest jewellery. Before converting to Christianity, the inhabitants used to burn their dead and to erect kurgan-like embankments over them.

In the 860s, the Varangians (Vikings) arrived and organized a few successful military campaigns against the Byzantine Empire, which eventually defeated them and made peace with them, the Pechenegs and the Polochans. From 9th century Polans began to be known as Rus&#x27;, and the region they inhabited as Rus&#x27; land, a name they presumably adopted from Varangians.

The chronicles repeatedly note that socio-economic relations in the Polan communities were highly developed compared to the neighboring tribes. According to the Primary Chronicle, the Polan tribe was headed by three brothers - Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, who laid the foundation of Kyiv, which will become a tribal centre. Two Varangians Askold and Dir are considered to be the first rulers of Kiev. In the 880s Oleg the Wise conquered the land of the Polans, from this point the territory they inhabited becomes the political, cultural and economic centre of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

According to chronicalized legends, the largest cities of the eastern Polans were Kyiv, Pereiaslav, Rodnia, Vyshhorod, Bilhorod Kyivskyi (now Bilohorodka village at the Irpin river) and Kaniv. In the 10th century, the term &quot;Polans&quot; was virtually out of use, replaced by the name &quot;Rus&quot;, with eastern Polans as a tribe being last mentioned in a chronicle of 944.

<doc id="945321" wikidata="Q9237041" url="?curid=945321" title="In the Pocket (James Taylor album)">
<text>In the Pocket is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor and his last to be released under Warner Bros. Records before signing with Columbia. Released in June 1976, the album found Taylor recording in the studio with many colleagues and friends, mainly Art Garfunkel (who duetted with him on &quot;A Junkie&#x27;s Lament&quot; and also contributed vocals on &quot;Captain Jim&#x27;s Drunken Dream&quot;), Carly Simon (Taylor&#x27;s wife, who harmonised with him on &quot;Shower the People&quot;), Stevie Wonder (who wrote with Taylor the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Sad &#x27;Cause Your Sun Is Down&quot;, a song on which he also played the harmonica) and David Crosby, Linda Ronstadt, and Bonnie Raitt, among others.

The result of the sessions, which took place between late 1975 and early &#x27;76, was a very melodic album and one of his most diverse and polished, highlighted with the single &quot;Shower the People&quot;, which through the years became a Taylor standard and concert favorite. Released as a single, the track peaked at #22 on the Billboard charts on September 18, 1976, and reached the summit of the Adult Contemporary charts in the US. Despite its success, &quot;In the Pocket&quot; didn&#x27;t match the success of Taylor&#x27;s previous album &quot;Gorilla&quot;, reaching only #16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts (it was Taylor&#x27;s lowest chart position during the 1970s and also the lowest since his debut album). Nevertheless, it managed to eventually get a Gold certification by the RIAA and became a fan favorite.

In 2008, the album was reissued on Rhino&#x27;s budget Flashback label.

<doc id="945322" wikidata="Q5341222" url="?curid=945322" title="Education on the Isle of Wight">
<text>Education on the Isle of Wight is provided by local education authority-maintained schools on the Isle of Wight, and independent schools. As a rural community, many of these schools are small, with average numbers of pupils lower than in many urban areas. It was decided on 19 March 2008, in a Whole Council Meeting, that the three-tier system would change into a two tier system. A report into the report on the re-organisation with proposals as to which schools would close was published in May 2008. There is also a college on the Isle of Wight and other less formal educational venues.

==School system==
The Isle of Wight now conforms to the general pattern of education in the United Kingdom in which pupils at state schools change schools at the age of eleven (see Education in England). Pupils at both of the island&#x27;s independent schools also change school at the age of eleven. State schools on the island now uses a two-tier system.

==Types of school==

The following types of school now exist:

===State schools===
*&quot;Primary Schools&quot; – There are 41 primary schools on the island, taking pupils from age four plus to eleven[the reception year to year 6]. Nineteen of these primary schools are Church of England or Catholic aided or controlled. Most primary schools have pre-school facilities.
*&quot;Secondary Schools&quot; – There are six secondary schools, taking pupils from age 11 to 18 (compulsory years 7 to 11 and &quot;sixth form&quot; years 12 and 13). Additionally there is one studio school taking pupils from age 13 to 18 (compulsory years 9 to 11 and &quot;sixth form&quot; years 12 and 13).
**Carisbrooke College, (near Newport) – Sports Specialist
**Cowes Enterprise College – Science Specialist
**Isle of Wight Studio School - Studio school
**Medina College – Performance Arts Specialist
**Ryde Academy – Language and Arts College
**Sandown Bay Academy – Sports Specialist
**Christ the King College – Maths &amp; ICT Specialist

===Independent schools===
There are two independent schools on the Isle of Wight, which educate pupils from the early years to the age of 18:
**Priory School, (Whippingham)
**Junior School for pupils aged 4 to 11 years
**Senior School for pupils aged 11 to 16 years
**Sixth Form for pupils aged 16 to 18 years
**Ryde School with Upper Chine, (Ryde)
**Fiveways (pre-prep) for pupils aged 3 to 7 years
**Prep School for pupils aged 7 to 11 years
**Senior School for pupils aged 11 to 16 years
**Sixth Form for pupils aged 16 to 18 years

==Timeline of the debate leading to the new arrangements==
In 2006, the regional Learning and Skills Council proposed to replace the state school sixth forms with central provision at the Isle of Wight College. In January 2007, the authority rejected this proposal, and instead offered its own, which included a reduced number of secondary schools, and the retention of Year 9 pupils in Middle schools, extending their range to form 9–14 schools – a unique arrangement in the United Kingdom – and 14–19 provision at High Schools.

In January 2008, more reforms were put forward, which could see the closure of at least half of the Island&#x27;s primary schools. On 14 January 2008 it was announced that at least 23 primary schools and 1 middle school (likely to be Nodehill Middle School) would be closed by whichever education pathway was chosen in March.

Option 1:

Primary/juniorhigh/learning centres, which would leave the Island with 32 primary schools, 10 Junior High Schools and 3 Learning Centres.

Option 2:

Two-tier primary/secondary set-up, which would leave the Island with 24 primary schools, 4 secondary schools and 1 faith college.

Option 3:

A similar two-tier set-up, which would leave the Island with 33 primary schools, 5 secondary schools and 1 faith college.

The schools would be spread out across the Island in Cowes, East Cowes, Ryde, East Wight, South East Wight, South Wight, West Wight and Newport. Trinity CE Middle School and ABK RC Middle School would join to form the faith college, Christ The King College, which will serve students from 11 – 19 once the transition phase is over, which would be based on the current Carisbrooke High School site.

Under all the options currently on offer, all the island schools close, however some will re-open on the existing site, while others will be moved to new sites. The Isle of Wight Council says it could save up to £2 million a year in money that would be spent on small primary schools, that under the new system, wouldn&#x27;t be needed. The changes will begin to be introduced from September 2010, although some could happen earlier.

There were also calls for a fourth option of extending middle schools to year 9. This would save primary schools across the Island in rural locations and enable middle and high schools to almost continue to function as they are, although this fourth option is unlikely to go ahead.

The &#x27;biggest protest the Island has ever seen&#x27; occurred outside County Hall in Newport on Saturday 26 January at 10:00am lasting an hour until 11:00am, led by Isle of Wight Radio DJ Alex Dyke as a result of the Council&#x27;s plans for education reforms. Between 1,000 and 1,250 took part in the protest, including parents, teachers and students. The Island MP Andrew Turner, with two other councillors also attended the protest, disagreeing with the plans.

More protests later occurred at Sandown, Shanklin and Ryde, with another at Newport. On 19 March 2008, a two-tier system was voted for by Isle of Wight councillors, bringing the island&#x27;s school system into line with the rest of the country.

It was finally announced in the Isle of Wight County Press on 23 May 2008 which schools would be closed.

The first of these reforms took place in September 2008, from the start of the new academic year. Archbishop King and Trinity Middle schools merged creating Christ the King College, with the old ABK site taking years 7 and 8, and the Trinity site taking years 5 and 6. Kitbridge Middle School also merged with Downside Middle school, creating two separate campuses. In September 2009, Christ the King College took another step towards becoming a secondary school, with its year 9 being retained rather than transitioning to high school.

==Adult education==
The Isle of Wight College provides a selection of courses, mostly offered on its campus in Newport. However, there are many other providers of adult education on the Isle of Wight including libraries, museums, Leisure Centres, West Wight Training Centre, Learning Links, Ventnor Community Projects, Quay Arts, Platform One and the Isle of Wight Council.

The local Council provides a wide range of adult and community learning opportunities. For example, the Council offers family learning opportunities, where parents and children learn together in schools. The Council also has developed community learning programmes which are delivered in communities to overcome difficulties in accessing learning such as time, transport and affordability.

==GCSE results 2012==
The first results after the 2012 Reorganisation were announced in October 2012. The Isle of Wight came 150th from 151 local authorities.

<doc id="945323" wikidata="Q3882517" url="?curid=945323" title="One Man Dog">
<text>One Man Dog is the fourth studio album by singer-songwriter James Taylor. Released on November 1, 1972, it features the hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight&quot;, which peaked at number 14 on the Billboard charts on January 13, 1973. The follow-up single, &quot;One Man Parade&quot;, also charted but less successfully, peaking at number 67 in the US and reaching number 55 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart. The basic tracks were primarily recorded in Taylor&#x27;s home studio.

The album is made up of 18 short pieces strung together. It climbed to number 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. There was also a Quadraphonic mix of the album that included alternate vocal takes and elongated versions of some songs.

Upon the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Berwyn Life&quot; critic Steve Sparacio said that it &quot;is certainly James Taylor&#x27;s best album.&quot; Sparacio noted that &quot;Upon first listening, no song on &quot;One Man Dog&quot; stands out. But as an entity the album holds together extremely well. It may be paradoxical but only after you&#x27;re able to view &quot;One Man Dog&quot; as a whole entity do you realize that some of the songs individually are very good.&quot; Sparacio identified the theme of the album to be an &quot;affirmation&quot; of Taylor&#x27;s life at the time, being newly married to Carly Simon and off drugs, and a realization that if he was going to cope with his life he needed to turn inward.

On the other hand, Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann considered the album to be a &quot;letdown&quot;, saying that &quot;a lot of it was sketchy and seemingly unfinished, and none of it had the impact of the best songs on the last two albums.&quot; &quot;Forest Park Review&quot; critic John Griffin praised the short songs for avoiding the monotony of similar slow melodies that he felt marred Taylor&#x27;s previous album &quot;Mud Slide Slim&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said it &quot;contains some interesting departures from his earlier work.&quot;

&quot;Calgary Herald&quot; critic Jim Rennie felt that the best song on the album was the traditional folk song &quot;One Morning in May,&quot; saying that &quot;Taylor joins forces vocally with luscious Linda Ronstadt, and the result is so good I think the combination is worth an album of its own.&quot;

<doc id="945326" wikidata="Q943151" url="?curid=945326" title="Gorilla (James Taylor album)">
<text>Gorilla is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor. Released in May 1975, it was more successful than &quot;Walking Man&quot;, his previous release. Two album tracks released as singles, &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;, rose to the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. This would be Taylor&#x27;s second-to-last album of new material for Warner Bros. Records, his last being &quot;In the Pocket&quot;. In many ways, &quot;Gorilla&quot; showcased Taylor&#x27;s electric, lighter side that became evident on &quot;Walking Man&quot;. The song &quot;Sarah Maria&quot; is about his daughter Sally (born Sarah Maria Taylor on January 7, 1974). His then-wife Carly Simon was featured on &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;, originally recorded by Marvin Gaye. Jimmy Buffett recorded &quot;Mexico&quot; on his 1995 album &quot;Barometer Soup&quot; and performed &quot;Lighthouse&quot; during his Salty Piece of Land tour of 2005.

<doc id="945327" wikidata="Q4017813" url="?curid=945327" title="Walking Man">
<text>Walking Man is the fifth studio album by singer-songwriter James Taylor. Released in June 1974, it was not as successful as his previous efforts, reaching only No. 13 on the Billboard Album Chart and selling 300,000 copies in the United States. Until 2008&#x27;s &quot;Covers&quot;, it was Taylor&#x27;s only studio album not to receive a gold or platinum certification from the RIAA.

The title track reached number 26 on the Easy Listening chart in October 1974.

&quot;Record World&quot; called the title track a &quot;tall, proud mansong&quot; that could be Taylor&#x27;s biggest hit since &quot;Fire and Rain.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the single &quot;Let It All Fall Down&quot; that it&#x27;s a &quot;tender, highly lyrical tune, very reminiscent of the artist&#x27;s powerful beginning..&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;nihilistic hymn of anarchy [that] gets the hauntingly up musical treatment.&quot;

&quot;Hello Old Friend&quot; was used in the intro for ABC&#x27;s Game 3 coverage of the 1989 World Series, just before the pre-game broadcast was interrupted by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake.

<doc id="945330" wikidata="Q570927" url="?curid=945330" title="Donald McKay">
<text>Donald McKay (September 4, 1810 – September 20, 1880) was a Nova Scotian-born American designer and builder of sailing ships, famed for his record-setting extreme clippers.

== Early life ==
McKay was born in Jordan Falls, Shelburne County, on Nova Scotia&#x27;s South Shore, the oldest son and one of eighteen children of Hugh McKay, a fisherman and a farmer, and Ann McPherson McKay. Both of his parents were of Scottish descent. He was named after his grandfather, Captain Donald McKay, a British officer, who after the Revolutionary war moved to Nova Scotia from the Scottish Highlands.

== Early years as a shipbuilder ==
In 1826 McKay moved to New York, where he served his apprenticeship under Isaac Webb in the Webb &amp; Allen shipyard from 1827 to 1831. He then returned briefly to Nova Scotia and built a boat with his uncle, but after they were swindled from the proceeds he returned to New York and took a job in the Brown &amp; Bell shipyard, working for Jacob Bell. In 1840, following a recommendation from Bell, he was taken on as a supervisor at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but stayed only briefly because of the anti-immigrant sentiment towards him (as a Canadian) from the men he was supervising. Bell came to the rescue and found him an assignment to work on a packet ship in a shipyard in Wiscasset, Maine. Returning south when that assignment was complete, he stopped in Newburyport and took a job as a foreman in the yard of John Currier, Jr., where he supervised the construction of the 427-ton &quot;Delia Walker.&quot; Currier was very impressed with McKay and offered him a five-year contract, which McKay refused driven by desire to own his own business.

In 1841, William Currier (no relation to John) offered McKay the chance to become a partner in what would become the Currier &amp; McKay shipyard in Newburyport. Two years later, with McKay now designing ships on his own, he and Currier parted ways and McKay went into business with a man named William Picket, building the packet ships &quot;St. George&quot; and &quot;John R. Skiddy&quot;. The partnership with Picket was &quot;pleasant and profitable&quot;, but after McKay built the &quot;Joshua Bates&quot; for Enoch Train&#x27;s new packet line to Liverpool in 1844, Train persuaded him to move to East Boston and start his own shipyard there. Train not only provided the financing for McKay to do this but then became his biggest customer, commissioning seven more packet ships and four clipper ships between 1845 and 1853—including the legendary extreme clipper &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;.

=== Ships built before 1845===
Sources:

* 1840 &quot;Delia Walker&quot;, 427 tons, McKay finished her for John Currier, Jr.
* 1841 &quot;Mary Broughton&quot;, 323 tons, barque, built by Currier &amp; McKay.
* 1842 &quot;Ashburton&quot;, 449 tons, ship, build by Currier &amp; McKay.
* 1842 Rio Trader &quot;Courier&quot;, early clipper trading ship, 380 tons OM was the first ship fully designed and built by Donald McKay himself, as a partner in the firm of Currier &amp; McKay, on a commission from Andrew Foster &amp; Son, New York. She was built at Newburyport, Massachusetts. At the time it was rather unusual for a such advanced vessel to be built outside of New York or Baltimore. She was employed in the Rio coffee trade and made a big deal of money to her owners, but most importantly brought a much needed fame to McKay.
* 1843 &quot;St. George&quot;, 845 tons, pioneer packet of Red Cross Line, built by McKay &amp; Picket.
* 1844 &quot;John R. Skiddy&quot;, 930 tons, packet, built by McKay &amp; Picket.
* 1844 &quot;Joshua Bates&quot;, 620 tons, pioneer packet of Enoch Train&#x27;s White Diamond Line. The White Diamond Line was one of the most important Atlantic emigrant routes from Europe to North America at the time. Built by McKay &amp; Pickett.

== East Boston shipyard ==
In 1845 McKay, as a sole owner, established his own shipyard on Border Street, East Boston, where he built some of the finest American ships over a career of almost 25 years.

One of his first large orders was building five large packet ships for Enoch Train&#x27;s White Diamond line between 1845 and 1850: &quot;Washington Irving&quot;, &quot;Anglo Saxon&quot;, &quot;Anglo American&quot;, &quot;Daniel Webster&quot;, and &quot;Ocean Monarch&quot;. The &quot;Ocean Monarch&quot; was lost to fire on August 28, 1848, soon after leaving Liverpool and within sight of Wales; over 170 of the passengers and crew perished. The &quot;Washington Irving&quot; carried Patrick Kennedy, grandfather of Kennedy family patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., to Boston in 1849.

In the summer of 1851, McKay visited Liverpool and secured a contract to build four large ships for James Baines &amp; Co.&#x27;s Australian trade: &quot;Lightning&quot; (1854), &quot;Champion of the Seas&quot; (1854), &quot;James Baines&quot; (1854), and &quot;Donald McKay (1855). &quot;

*&quot;Bald Eagle&quot; set the record of 78 days 22 hours for a fully laden ship from San Francisco to New York.

==Late life==
In 1869, under financial pressure from previous losses, McKay sold his shipyard and worked for some time in other shipyards. He retired to his farm near Hamilton, Massachusetts, spending the rest of his life there. He died in 1880 in relative poverty and was buried in Newburyport.

==Design practices==
McKay&#x27;s designs were characterized by a long fine bow with increasing hollow and waterlines. He was perhaps influenced by the writings of John W. Griffiths, designer of the China clipper &quot;Rainbow&quot; in 1845. The long hollow bow helped to penetrate rather than ride over the wave produced by the hull at high speeds, reducing resistance as hull speed is approached. Hull speed is the natural speed of a wave the same length as the ship, in knots, formula_1, where LWL = Length of Water Line in feet. His hulls had a shorter afterbody, putting the center of buoyancy farther aft than was typical of the period, as well as a full midsection with rather flat bottom. These characteristics led to lower drag at high speed compared to other ships of similar length, as well as great stability which translated into the ability to carry sail in high winds (more power in extreme conditions). His fishing schooner design was even more radical than his clippers, being a huge flat-bottomed dinghy similar in form to 20th century planing boats. These design changes were not favorable for light wind conditions such as were expected on the China trade, but were profitable in the California and Australian trades.

== Legacy and honors ==
Pan Am named one of their Boeing 747s &quot;Clipper Donald McKay&quot; in his honor.

There is a monument to McKay in South Boston, near Fort Independence, overlooking the channel, that lists all his ships. There were more than thirty ships listed.

His house in East Boston was designated a Boston Landmark in 1977 and is also on the National Register of Historic Places.

A memorial pavilion to McKay, including a painting of his famous &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;, can be found at Piers Park in East Boston.

McKay was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame on November 9, 2019.

<doc id="945336" wikidata="Q1132323" url="?curid=945336" title="JT (album)">
<text>JT is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor. It was released on June 22, 1977, via Columbia Records, making it his first album released for the label. Recording session took place from March 15 to April 24, 1977, at The Sound Factory in Los Angeles with Val Garay. Production was handled by Peter Asher.

The album peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart in the United States and was Taylor&#x27;s highest-charting album since &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot;. By January 31, 1997, it was certified 3 times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. At the 20th Annual Grammy Awards, it was also nominated for Grammy Award for Album of the Year, but lost to &quot;Rumours&quot; by Fleetwood Mac. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;JT&quot; finished at No. 23. It would be the first and only time James Taylor would place an album in the poll&#x27;s top 30 during its entire existence.

The album spawned three singles: &quot;Handy Man&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s final top 10 hit), &quot;Your Smiling Face&quot; and &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t Leave L.A.&quot; &quot;Handy Man&quot;, a Jimmy Jones cover, peaked at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the Adult Contemporary and won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. &quot;Your Smiling Face&quot;, the other big hit, peaked at #20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #6 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The record also contains other Taylor classics such as &quot;Secret O&#x27; Life&quot; and &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, with the participation of Taylor&#x27;s then-wife Carly Simon.

==Critical reception==
Robert Christgau, who had been skeptical of Taylor&#x27;s previous work, expressed surprise when the album exceeded his expectations, writing that &quot;James sounds both awake and in touch...&#x27;Handy Man&#x27; is a transcendent sex ballad, while &#x27;I Was Only Telling a Lie&#x27; and &#x27;Secret &#x27;o Life&#x27; evoke comparisons with betters on the order of the Stones and Randy Newman, so that the wimpy stuff — which still predominates — sounds merely laid-back in contrast. Best since &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;...some of this is so wry and lively and committed his real fans may find it obtrusive.&quot;

Peter Herbst in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;JT&quot; is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That&#x27;s not meant to criticize Taylor&#x27;s earlier efforts...but it&#x27;s nice to hear him sounding so healthy.&quot;

John Rockwell in &quot;The New York Times&quot; complimented &quot;JT&quot; as &quot;one of [Taylor&#x27;s] stronger efforts in recent years&quot; writing that Taylor &quot;is at his most overtly effective on the single, &#x27;Handy Man.&#x27; This old Otis Blackwell song was probably not designed for Mr. Taylor&#x27;s sexily intimate way of singing it, but the decision to do it that way was an inspired one, and the arrangement is really quite wonderful. Nothing else on the record seems quite so good, but the level is pleasingly high.&quot; Rockwell also argues that Taylor &quot;has never quite recaptured the inspiration of his early &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; album, and &quot;JT&quot; doesn&#x27;t do it, either. Perhaps the most obvious way that the new songs don&#x27;t equal the old is their relative lack of memorable melody. Mr. Taylor&#x27;s songs sound more like conversational recitations than tunes. They&#x27;re still interesting, though, and some of the accompaniments are really delightful.&quot;

<doc id="945337" wikidata="Q518574" url="?curid=945337" title="Karen McCarthy">
<text>Karen McCarthy (March 18, 1947 – October 5, 2010) was an American educator and politician. She served as the U.S. representative for the fifth district of Missouri from 1995 to 2005.

==Early life==
McCarthy was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts and grew up in Leawood, Kansas, and graduated from Shawnee Mission East High School. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and English from the University of Kansas in 1969 and a Master of Arts in English Education from the University of Missouri–Kansas City in 1976. McCarthy later earned an M.B.A. at the University of Kansas. Prior to running for public office, McCarthy taught English at Shawnee Mission South High School and the Sunset Hill School.

==Missouri state politics==
First elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1976 as a Democrat, McCarthy was re-elected eight times, generally with little opposition. She became a ranking party member in the state House, serving on numerous committees including chairman of Ways and Means (1983-1995), and a member of the Appropriations and Energy committees. McCarthy also served as the first female president of the National Conference of State Legislatures in 1994.

==House career==
In 1994, Congressman Alan Wheat ran for the U.S. Senate, leaving an open seat. McCarthy won a crowded six-way primary, and then defeated Republican Ron Freeman with 56 percent of the vote. She was easily reelected four more times. McCarthy served on the Energy and Commerce committee (subcommittees: Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, Energy and Air Quality, Telecommunications and Internet and Environment and Hazardous Materials) and the Select Committee on Homeland Security as the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence and Counterterrorism subcommittee.

McCarthy announced in 2003 that she would not run for a sixth term in 2004 after revealing that she suffered from alcoholism. A widely reported incident in which an intoxicated McCarthy fell down inside a House office building forced her to admit her problem and seek treatment.

Selected honors include the Missouri Citizens for the Arts 2005 Advocacy Award and the Business and Professional Women of the USA&#x27;s Woman of the Year award.

==Global climate change activities==
McCarthy served as co-chair of the Missouri Commission of Global Climate Change, an extensive two-year (1989–1991) study of scientific data to develop environmental and economic policy options for state action. She was also a congressional representative to the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change and a Harvard fellow at the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government &quot;The Politics of Alternative Energies&quot;, in the fall of 1982.

==Post-congressional activities and death==
In December 2003, McCarthy announced that she would not seek another term in the House. She was succeeded by Emanuel Cleaver, a fellow Democrat. McCarthy returned to Kansas City, Missouri, where she sat on a number of boards and was an active fundraiser and sponsor for a variety of cultural and political activities.

In June 2009, her family revealed that McCarthy was suffering from an advanced form of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and was residing in a nursing home. Their statement said her difficulties were compounded by a bipolar disorder that apparently went undiagnosed for at least a decade. A non-injury car accident involving McCarthy at her home in April prompted her friends to seek medical help, which revealed her illnesses.

McCarthy died on October 5, 2010, at age 63.

==Electoral history==
Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, Reform candidate Dennis M. Carriger received 974 votes.

<doc id="945339" wikidata="Q3700757" url="?curid=945339" title="Dad Loves His Work">
<text>Dad Loves His Work is the tenth studio album by James Taylor, released in 1981. The album includes the duet with JD Souther titled &quot;Her Town Too&quot;, which peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. The album was certified Platinum in the United States. It was his first album without any covers.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s title was a response by Taylor to then-wife Carly Simon, who had issued an ultimatum to Taylor regarding his constant touring, leaving her home with their two children, Benjamin and Sally. Simon informed Taylor in 1980 that unless he curtailed his schedule to be home more with his family, that she would divorce him. Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, the pair separated, officially dissolving their 11-year marriage in 1983. Taylor, who was still struggling with a lengthy history of drug abuse, later admitted that he was ill-equipped to be a family man at that time in his life and put his career before his family.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;the tunes are simple and memorable—you can sing along with most of them after two listens.&quot;

<doc id="945341" wikidata="Q3746323" url="?curid=945341" title="Flag (James Taylor album)">
<text>Flag is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor released on May 1, 1979. The album included songs (&quot;Millworker&quot;, &quot;Brother Trucker&quot;) from Taylor&#x27;s music score to Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s Broadway musical, &quot;Working&quot;, based on the book by Studs Terkel.

The album was not well received, but it did provide a hit in Taylor&#x27;s cover version of the Gerry Goffin–Carole King composition &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s most recent top 40 hit as a solo artist).

&quot;Rainy Day Man&quot;, which first appeared on Taylor&#x27;s self-titled debut album, was re-recorded.

The signal flag that makes up the cover of the album is &quot;O (Oscar)&quot;, standing for man overboard.

On the May 12, 1979, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Taylor was the musical guest, and performed three songs from the album, &quot;Up on the Roof&quot;, &quot;Millworker&quot;, and &quot;Johnnie Comes Back&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Taylor&#x27;s &quot;vulnerable tenor and the glossy production Peter Asher gives his record conspire to court blandness.&quot;

<doc id="945346" wikidata="Q1363742" url="?curid=945346" title="That's Why I'm Here">
<text>That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here is the eleventh studio album by singer-songwriter James Taylor released in 1985, four years after his previous effort, &quot;Dad Loves His Work&quot;. The album contains a version of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Everyday&quot;, as well as the participation of several singers, including Don Henley, Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash and Deniece Williams. &quot;My Romance&quot; was not on the LP or cassette version. &quot;Only One&quot; peaked at number 6 on the US Adult Contemporary chart and at number 3 in Canada.

==Reception==
In regard to &quot;Only One,&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; remarked, &quot;Taylor breaks no new ground with this single, but his pure voice and beautiful sense of melody and harmony will be welcome,&quot; and said the album&#x27;s title track is &quot;a happy celebration of the artist&#x27;s years as public property.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s review stated, &quot;Taylor&#x27;s calm manner and breezy, light rock melody belie some fairly complex conclusions in this autobiographical statement.&quot;

==History==
This riding was originally created in 1914 from Winnipeg and Selkirk ridings.

In 1997, it was renamed &quot;Winnipeg North—St. Paul&quot;.

In 2003, Winnipeg North—St. Paul was abolished with parts transferred to Winnipeg North, Winnipeg Centre and Kildonan—St. Paul ridings. Winnipeg North was re-created from parts of Winnipeg North—St. Paul and Winnipeg North Centre.

Historically a safe seat for the New Democratic Party, in 2011 Winnipeg North was narrowly retained by Liberal incumbent Kevin Lamoureux in an otherwise dismal performance by the party nationwide. It also holds the distinction of being the only seat flipped by the Liberals in 2011, compared to 2008, when the seat was held by the New Democratic Party. Along with Wascana around Regina, Saskatchewan, Winnipeg North was one of only two seats won by the Liberals in the Prairie Provinces.

This riding gained territory from Kildonan—St. Paul during the 2012 Canadian federal electoral redistribution.

Kevin Lamoureux was re-elected to represent Winnipeg North in the 2015 Canadian federal election, as the Liberals formed a majority government. In 2015, he was the only incumbent MP from Winnipeg to be re-elected. He was re-elected as the Liberals won minority governments in 2019 and 2021.

<doc id="945348" wikidata="Q3875117" url="?curid=945348" title="Never Die Young">
<text>Never Die Young is the twelfth studio album by singer-songwriter James Taylor released in 1988, three years after his previous effort, &quot;That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here&quot;. The album reached No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually was certified Platinum by the RIAA. It features the title track, which peaked at No. 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the only charting single from the album.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the title track that the &quot;lyrics are, as always, a dazzling string of pearls that mesmerize your heart while the musical feel covers you like a warm breeze.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of &quot;Baby Boom Baby&quot; that &quot;Taylor again defines the agonizingly beautiful attainment of everything and really nothing at all, life&#x27;s passage and passing.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of &quot;Sweet Potato Pie&quot; that it contains &quot;smooth yet deceptively deep material.&quot;

Fairport Convention covered &quot;The Frozen Man&quot; on their album &quot;Old New Borrowed Blue&quot;.

<text>The piaffe () is a dressage movement where the horse is in a highly collected and cadenced trot, in place or nearly in place. The center of gravity of the horse should be more towards the hind end, with the hindquarters slightly lowered and great bending of the joints in the hind legs. The front end of the horse is highly mobile, free, and light, with great flexion in the joints of the front legs, and the horse remains light in the hand. The horse should retain a clear and even rhythm, show great impulsion, and ideally should have a moment of suspension between the foot falls. As in all dressage, the horse should perform in a calm manner and remain on the bit with a round back.

The piaffe was originally used in battle to keep the horse focused, warm, and moving, ready to move forward into battle. In modern times, the piaffe is mostly taught as an upper level movement in Classical dressage and as a Grand Prix level movement. Additionally, it is needed to develop the levade and from that, the airs above the ground.

== Correct piaffe work ==
The following are elements of the correct piaffe:
* The piaffe is straight and comes from the rider containing the horse&#x27;s desire to go forward. The legs do not move out to the side or cross.
* The horse lowers his hindquarters, collects, and raises the shoulders by taking weight onto the hindquarters, rather than hollowing the back and piaffing with the hindquarters trailing out behind.
* Bending of the joints is not always a good indication of true collection (and therefore a correct piaffe). It is possible to perform a piaffe-like movement with good bend in the legs while the horse remains hollow and on the forehand. This can especially be seen in horses trained to trot in place by holding them back while asking the hindlegs to bend by applying the whip on the hocks. The horse will bend the hocks, but will not lower the hindquarters.
* The horse is not to raise the hind legs higher than the front, which comes when the horse is on the forehand, nor show exaggerated bending of the front legs without true collection.
* The horse remains relaxed and supple. An incorrect piaffe has short, jerky steps.
* The horse does not move his fore legs backward toward his hind legs, so that they are more under his body, but rather keep them perpendicular to the ground.
* The horse remains at or in front of the vertical, with his poll as the highest point.
* The horse maintains the rhythm and tempo of the trot.

<doc id="945357" wikidata="Q3786994" url="?curid=945357" title="Hourglass (James Taylor album)">
<text>Hourglass is the fourteenth studio album by singer-songwriter James Taylor released in 1997. It was his first studio album in six years since 1991&#x27;s &quot;New Moon Shine&quot;. It was a huge commercial success, reaching No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, his first Top 10 album in sixteen years and also provided a big adult contemporary hit, &quot;Little More Time With You&quot;. 

The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since &quot;JT&quot;, when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998. The album also won producer/engineer Frank Filipetti a Grammy that year for Best Engineered Album. The majority of the album was recorded using a Yamaha O2R mixer and three Tascam DA-88 multitrack recorders, which were early digital devices not typically used by top level artists, as most major label records were still being recorded to analog tape at that time.

The album was dedicated to Don Grolnick who was a frequent collaborator with Taylor and who died during the Hourglass sessions in 1996 due to Non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

==Background==
&quot;Hourglass&quot; was an introspective album with lyrics that focused largely on Taylor&#x27;s troubled past and family. &quot;Jump Up Behind Me&quot; paid tribute to his father&#x27;s rescue of him after the Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill. &quot;Enough to Be On Your Way&quot; was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade. The themes were also inspired by Taylor&#x27;s divorce from actress Kathryn Walker, which took place in 1996. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found that &quot;one of the themes of this record is disbelief&quot;, while Taylor told the magazine that it was &quot;spirituals for agnostics.&quot;

<doc id="945362" wikidata="Q1798287" url="?curid=945362" title="Trot">
<text>The trot is a two-beat diagonal horse gait where the diagonal pairs of legs move forward at the same time with a moment of suspension between each beat. It has a wide variation in possible speeds, but averages about . A very slow trot is sometimes referred to as a jog. An extremely fast trot has no special name, but in harness racing, the trot of a Standardbred is faster than the gallop of the average non-racehorse, and has been clocked at over .

On June 29, 2014, at Pocono Downs in Pennsylvania the Swedish standardbred Sebastian K trotted a mile in 1 minute, 49 seconds (quarters were passed at 26:2, 55:3 and 1,21:4). This is equivalent to a 1000-pace in 1.07,7 or 53.14 kilometers per hour or 33 miles per hour.

From the standpoint of the balance of the horse, the trot is a very stable gait and does not require the horse to make major balancing motions with its head and neck. Due to its many variations, the trot is a common gait that the horse is worked in for dressage.

Eadweard Muybridge was the first to prove, by photography, in 1872 that there is a &quot;moment of suspension&quot; or &quot;unsupported transit&quot; during the trot gait.

==Types==



Depending on the amount of engagement and collection of the horse, the trot can generally be classified as &quot;working&quot;, &quot;collected&quot;, or &quot;extended&quot;. By the rhythm, one may distinguish a true, two-beat square trot when each diagonal pair of hoofs hits the ground at the same moment from a four-beat intermediate ambling gait, such as the fox trot or the &quot;trocha&quot; sometimes seen in the Paso Fino.

Different speeds and types of trots are described by the following terms:

* Jog trot, as seen in western horses, is a slow, relaxed trot lacking the suspension of a working trot and with shorter strides. It is easy to ride because there is less &quot;bounce&quot;. The head of the horse is carried low while the hindquarters are engaged and underneath the horse, and there is less impulsion than in a dressage-style collected trot.
* Collected trot: A very engaged trot where most of the horse&#x27;s weight is carried toward the hindquarters. The frame is compressed and the stride length is shorter than any of the other trots with the horse taking higher steps. The horse is lighter and more mobile in the collected trot.
* Slow trot (harness) or Road gait (roadster): Is slower than a working trot, but faster than a jog trot. This gait is one of the gaits used in harness classes at horse shows.
* Working trot or Trot: The stride length (note: some breeds have naturally varied strides) is &quot;normal&quot; for the horse and is the natural trot of the horse when under saddle. It is a gait between the collected trot and medium trot. 
* Medium trot: A trot that is more engaged and rounder than the working trot with moderately extended strides and good, solid impulsion. The medium trot lies between the working and the extended trot. 
* Park trot: Sometimes simply called a Trot in a given class and seen in saddle seat and fine harness classes for Saddlebreds, Arabians and Morgans. It is a showy, flashy trot with extreme elevation of the knees (forearm is horizontal or higher and the hind legs are extremely flexed). The head is held high and at times a horse may hollow its back and lose cadence in an attempt to achieve high action in front. The hindquarters must be engaged for it to be properly performed. 
* Lengthened trot: A trot with lengthened strides. It differs from the more advanced extended trot in that it does not require the horse to bring its weight as far back on its hindquarters. 
* Road trot or Show at Speed: As seen in roadster classes, is a gait similar to a racing trot, but much slower (suitable for an arena setting). The horse&#x27;s head is collected, the stride is at maximum length, and the step is high and animated.
* Extended trot: An engaged trot with long strides where the horse stretches its frame and lengthens its strides to the greatest degree possible. The horse has a great amount of suspension. The back is round and the horse&#x27;s head just in front and vertical. 
* Racing trot: As seen in harness racing horses that race at a trot, such as Standardbred. The stride is at its maximum length with a great deal of suspension. The hind leg in a diagonal pair may begin to hit the ground before the front. Unlike the extended trot, the neck is not round but is extended out. , the North American speed record for a racing trot under saddle at one mile is 1:59, or 

===Haute Ecole variations on the trot===

Two variations of the trot are specially trained in advanced dressage horses: the Piaffe and the Passage. The Piaffe is essentially created by asking the horse to trot in place, with very little forward motion. The Passage (rhymes with &quot;massage&quot;) is an exaggerated slow motion trot. Both require tremendous collection, careful training and considerable physical conditioning for a horse to perform.

==Riding technique==
Depending on the horse and its speed, a trot can be difficult for a rider to sit because the body of the horse actually drops slightly between beats and bounces up again when the next set of legs strike the ground. Each time another diagonal pair of legs hits the ground, the rider can be jolted upwards out of the saddle and meet the horse with some force on the way back down. Therefore, at most speeds above a jog, especially in English riding disciplines, most riders &quot;post&quot; to the trot, rising up and down in rhythm with the horse to avoid being jolted. Posting is easy on the horse&#x27;s back, and once mastered is also easy on the rider.

To not be jostled out of the saddle and to not harm the horse by bouncing on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.

Because the trot is such a safe and efficient gait for a horse, learning to ride the trot correctly is an important component in almost all equestrian disciplines, particularly for equitation riders. &quot;Gaited&quot; or &quot;ambling&quot; horses, which have smooth 4-beat intermediate gaits that replace or supplement the trot, are popular with riders who prefer for various reasons not to have to ride at a trot.

There are three ways the trot may be ridden:

*Sitting: The rider&#x27;s seat remains in the saddle the whole time while following the motion of the horse and without bouncing. This is required for show ring western riding and preferred in dressage, especially at the upper levels. Sitting the trot gives the rider optimum control, because he or she can use the seat and weight to ask the horse to make upward or downward transitions, turns, and/or to decrease or increase impulsion. It is also a test of equitation by proving that the rider can quietly move with the horse. The jog, which is the preferred gait of western horses, is generally smoother and less-bouncy than the working and extended trot of the English-style horse. Sitting can be very tiring for the rider, especially if performed by riders who have not built up their stomach and back muscles, or if riders are on an extremely powerful mount with a big trot. To sit the trot, there is a slight forward and back movement of the lower back and stomach as the rider&#x27;s hips follow both the up and down and side-to-side motion of the horse. To absorb the impact of the trot, the rider relaxes through the hips and the stomach and lower back, as well as the legs. The rider&#x27;s upper body remains upright and quiet. The rider&#x27;s hands remain steady. The lower legs remain relaxed and only come into play when the rider gives a leg aid. If a rider cannot sit the trot and is bounced around, the rising trot is preferable, because not only is the rider uncomfortable, the constant slamming of the rider onto the horse is uncomfortable for the horse. As a result, it will hollow its back and stiffen its movement.
*Rising or Posting: The rider makes an up-and-down movement each stride, rising out of the saddle for one beat and lowering (sits) for the second beat. When the rising trot is performed correctly, it is comfortable for the rider and easy on the horse. This is preferred for show jumping, hunt seat, eventing (the jumping phases), saddle seat, lower-level dressage, and most other English-type riding as well as endurance riding. Although this does not provide as much control as sitting, it frees the horse&#x27;s back. In the rising trot, the rider allows the horse&#x27;s movement to throw his or her seat a bit out of the saddle. When coming back down, the seat touches down lightly rather than slamming down on the horse&#x27;s back. Except in saddle seat riding, rider&#x27;s shoulders maintain a slight forward incline throughout the rising trot, instead of the upright, vertical position seen in sitting trot. The shoulders and lower legs remain in relatively the same position when the rider is both rising and sitting and the hands also stay in the same position as the rider rises and sits.

*Half-seat or Two-point: Also called a jumping position. Sometimes used synonymously, the half-seat variation involves the rider getting the seat bones off the saddle and keeping soft contact with the pelvis, and two-point variation involves the rider raising the seat and pelvic bones. In both cases, the rider remains off the saddle and does not sit or post. This provides a great deal of freedom for the horse&#x27;s back. It also offers the least amount of control for the rider. These positions are rarely used at the trot; although, both are common at the canter for jumping riders. Two-point position also requires a good amount of strength in the rider&#x27;s legs.

===Diagonals===
A rider posts to one &quot;diagonal&quot; or the other at the trot; when the rider is on the correct diagonal, the rider sits as the horse&#x27;s inside hind leg and outside foreleg are on the ground and rises as the outside hind leg and inside foreleg are on the ground. Diagonals are used in the posting trot help to keep the horse balanced, and are also useful for timing certain riding aids, such as those for the canter. A rider can learn to recognize diagonals by feel. However, less-experienced riders can check for the correct diagonal by a quick glance at the horse&#x27;s shoulder, sitting when the outside foreleg is on the ground and the shoulder is back.

<doc id="945364" wikidata="Q5569581" url="?curid=945364" title="Glider Badge">
<text>The Glider Badge was a special skills badge of the United States Army. According to the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry, the badge was awarded to personnel who had &quot;been assigned or attached to a glider or airborne unit or to the Airborne Department of the Infantry School; satisfactorily completed a course of instruction, or participated in at least one combat glider mission into enemy-held territory.

==History==
The badge was authorized on 2 June 1944 and discontinued on 3 May 1961 but may continue to be worn on U.S. Army uniforms.

Following the close of the Second World War, the Glider Badge was authorized to any service member who had completed glider unit training at the Airborne School.

In the post-World War II years, the US Army converted its remaining glider units to parachute. For example, the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 82d Airborne Division was reorganized and redesignated on 15 December 1947 as the 325th Infantry Regiment (no longer glider infantry), and then reorganized and redesignated again on 15 December 1948 as the 325th Airborne Infantry. Likewise, the 319th Glider Field Artillery Battalion, also part of the 82d Airborne Division, was reorganized and redesignated on 15 December 1947 as the 319th Field Artillery Battalion, and then reorganized and redesignated on 15 December 1948 as the 319th Airborne Field Artillery Battalion. Although glider units had ceased to exist, the badge was not formally rescinded until 3 May 1961; however, it remained authorized for wear by those who earned it.

Glider training was included in the United States Army&#x27;s basic Airborne course until 1949, which at that time lasted five weeks. The first week of the course covered air transportability training, which included glider training. During late summer of that year, a glider crashed, killing many of those on board, and glider training came to an end.

==Garrison cap insignia==

A cloth circular Airborne (Glider) Insignia, similar to the Airborne (Parachute) Insignia, was worn on the garrison cap of active glider units until the Army combined the parachute and glider insignias into one Airborne Insignia worn by all airborne and glider-born units.
Glider-borne soldiers wore a background trimming (a.k.a. a cloth oval) behind their Glider Badge to signify assignment to glider units.

The color pattern of the background trimming varied depending upon the unit.

In 1944 the separate parachute and glider insignias with infantry blue or artillery red background were merged into a combined parachute and glider on a blue base with a red circle. (Note: During World War II the term &quot;Airborne&quot; included parachute, glider, and air-landing units. With the elimination of glider and air-landing units from the force structure in the post-war years, Airborne became synonymous with parachute units only.)

==Glider Operations during World War II==

U.S. Army glider units participated in eight glider-airborne operations during World War II:
* Invasion of Sicily (Operation HUSKY) July 9–13, 1943
* 1st Air Commando Group in Burma (Operation THURSDAY) March–May 1944
* Invasion of Normandy (Operation NEPTUNE, airborne phase of Operation OVERLORD) June 6–8, 1944
* Invasion of southern France (Operation DRAGOON) August 15, 1944
* Invasion of Netherlands (Operation MARKET, airborne phase of Operation MARKET GARDEN) September 17–23, 1944
* Re-supply of Bastogne (a flight on December 25, 1944 and Operation REPULSE) December 26–27, 1944
* Rhine River crossing at Wesel (Operation VARSITY) March 24, 1945
* Aparri, Luzon, PI (Operation GYPSY) June 23, 1945

<text>Niko Klaus Petteri Kapanen (born 29 April 1978) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey centre, who last played for HPK of the Finnish Liiga.

==Playing career==
Kapanen was drafted by the Dallas Stars in the 6th round as the 173rd overall pick in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. During the 2005–06 season, Kapanen recorded a career high in goals (14) and points (35). He scored his first career hat-trick on February 9, 2006, against the Phoenix Coyotes in a 5–1 victory.

On June 24, 2006, Kapanen was traded by the Stars to the Atlanta Thrashers, along with 7th round draft pick in 2006, for defenceman Jaroslav Modrý and centerman Patrik Štefan. During his first season with the Thrashers, Kapanen was picked up off the waiver list by the Phoenix Coyotes.

On June 9, 2008, Kapanen left the NHL and signed for Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League.

After five seasons with Ak Bars, Kapanen left as a free agent to sign a multi-year contract with Czech club HC Lev Praha of the KHL on August 11, 2013. Hampered by injury, Kapanen had a less than successful regular 2013–14 season with Praha, but redeemed himself in playoffs to post 11 points in 21 games as Lev reached the Gagarin Cup finals.

Kapanen association with Lev was ended after one-year upon the club announcing financial bankruptcy. On July 10, 2014, Kapanen signed a one-year contract with new Finnish KHL entrant, Jokerit.

==International play==





Kapanen had a highly decorated international career with Finland in collecting a medal at every level played. He made his debut as a junior in the 1997 World Junior Championships, claiming a gold medal at the following junior Championships in 1998. At the senior men&#x27;s level Kapanen competed in 9 World Championships in capturing 5 medals, including a gold at the 2011 World Championships. He twice represented Finland at the Winter Olympics claiming a Silver and Bronze at the 2006 and 2010 tournaments respectively.

<text>José Enrique Serrano (born October 24, 1943) is an American politician who was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1990 until his retirement in 2021. Serrano, a Democrat from New York, represented a district that is one of the smallest in the country geographically, consisting of a few square miles of the heavily populated South Bronx in New York City. His district was also one of the most densely populated and one of the few majority Hispanic districts in the country. The district was numbered the from 1990 to 1993 and the from 1993 to 2013, and the from 2013 to 2021. He was the longest-serving Hispanic-American in the House. He did not run for re-election in 2020 due to a diagnosis of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Ritchie Torres was elected to succeed him.

==Early life, education, and military service==

Serrano was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. At the age of seven, Serrano was taken by his family to The Bronx, where he was raised in the Millbrook Houses. Serrano went to Grace Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx and briefly attended Lehman College in 1961. He served as a private in the 172nd Support Battalion of the United States Army Medical Corps from 1964 to 1966. Serrano was employed by Manufacturers Hanover Bank from 1961 to 1969, except for his military service, and served on New York City&#x27;s District 7 School Board from 1969 to 1974. He was also chairman of the South Bronx Community Corporation and a delegate to the 1976 Democratic National Convention.

==New York Assembly==

Serrano was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1990, sitting in the 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th and 188th New York State Legislatures. His district was numbered the 75th until 1982, and the 73rd from 1983 on. He was Chairman of the Committee on Consumer Affairs (1979-1983), and the Committee on Education (1983-1990).

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1990, Serrano won a special election for the seat vacated by resigning U.S. Congressman Robert García with 92% of the vote. He never won re-election with less than 92% of the vote in what is considered one of the safest seats in Congress.

In 2004, Serrano faced an electoral challenge from Jose Serrano, an unemployed former loading dockworker with the same name who eventually dropped out of the race in July.

===Tenure===


A member of the Progressive Caucus, Serrano was widely regarded as one of the most progressive members of Congress. He was questioned about his pork barrel spending by some fiscally conservative members of Congress. Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake once said of Serrano&#x27;s $150,000 earmark to repair the roof at the city-owned Arthur Avenue Market (a historic indoor produce and prepared food market in the Bronx&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot;), &quot;I would argue this is one cannoli the taxpayer doesn&#x27;t want to take a bite of.&quot; Serrano replied to Flake, &quot;The more you get up on these, sir, the more I realize that you do not know what you are talking about. I make no excuses about the fact that I earmark dollars to go in the poorest congressional district in the nation, which is situated in the richest city on earth.&quot;

On November 18, 2005, Serrano was one of three members of the House of Representatives to vote in favor of immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. The other two votes were from Cynthia McKinney of Georgia and Robert Wexler of Florida.

In 1997 [HJR 19], 1999 [HJR 17], 2001 [HJR 4], 2003 [HJR 11], 2005 [HJR 9], 2007 [HJR 8], 2009 [HJR 5], 2011 [HJR 17], and 2013 [HJR 15], Serrano introduced a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to repeal the 22nd Amendment, thereby removing presidential term limits. Each resolution died without ever getting past the committee.

Serrano paid attention to local environmental issues in New York, with a particular focus on constructing greenways, acquiring parklands, and cleaning up the Bronx River, which ran through his district. Recently a beaver was discovered swimming in the river for the first time in 200 years, something seen as a testament to his efforts. In 2007, he engineered the purchase of the last privately owned island in New York harbor—South Brother Island—for preservation in perpetuity by the City of New York as a wildlife refuge for rare shorebirds.

Serrano was one of three New York-area congressmen on the House Appropriations Committee, the others being Nita Lowey of the 18th district and Grace Meng of the 6th district. At the end of his tenure, he was the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services, having previously served as the chair. As chairman, he successfully engineered the inclusion of language in the 2007 omnibus spending bill that guaranteed the extension of the 50 State Quarters program to include the minting of six additional quarters to honor the District of Columbia and the five United States territories, including Serrano&#x27;s native Puerto Rico.

Serrano advocated for Puerto Ricans under FBI prosecution. In May 2000, he brokered an agreement with then-FBI Director Louis Freeh, then-Puerto Rican Independence Party Electoral Commissioner Manuel Rodríguez Orellana and then-Puerto Rico Senate Federal Affairs Committee chairman (and future Puerto Rico Senate President and Secretary of State) Kenneth McClintock that resulted in the release of nearly 100,000 pages of previously secret FBI files on Puerto Rican political activists.

Serrano was a critic of the Bush administration&#x27;s approach to handling President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. In 2005, while the Venezuelan President was in New York City speaking before the United Nations, the congressman invited him to his district to speak to his constituency. After Chávez&#x27; death, Serrano published condolences via &quot;Twitter&quot;, describing him as a leader who &quot;understood the needs of the poor&quot; and was &quot;committed to empowering the powerless&quot;. Serrano&#x27;s tweet prompted a response from the Republican National Committee, which asserted that it was &quot;simply insulting that a Democrat Congressman would praise the authoritarian ruler Hugo Chávez&quot;.

Serrano criticized Brazil&#x27;s president Jair Bolsonaro. In March 2019, he and 29 other Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that read in part, &quot;Since the election of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro as president, we have been particularly alarmed by the threat Bolsonaro’s agenda poses to the LGBTQ+ community and other minority communities, women, labor activists, and political dissidents in Brazil&quot;.

In March 2019, Serrano announced that he would not seek re-election in 2020 because he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>The Polans (Polish: &quot;Polanie&quot;; Latin: &quot;Polani&quot;, &quot;Polanos&quot;), also known as Polanians or Western Polans (Polish: &quot;Polanie Zachodni&quot;; Latin: &quot;Polani Occidentis&quot;), were a West Slavic and Lechitic tribe, inhabiting the Warta River basin of the contemporary Greater Poland region starting in the 6th century. They were one of the main tribes in Central Europe and were closely related to the Vistulans, Masovians, Czechs and Slovaks. According to Zygmunt Gloger, their name was derived from the word &quot;pole&quot; meaning &quot;field&quot;, thus denoting them as &quot;men of the fields&quot;. 

==History==
In the 9th century, the Polans united several West Slavic (Lechitic) groups to the north of Great Moravia. The union led by the Piast dynasty developed into the Duchy of Poland, whose name derives from that of the Polans.

The earliest Polan rulers mentioned by name are the legendary figures of Piast the Wheelwright and Popiel (8th–9th centuries). The first historical ruler was Mieszko I (960–992), who enlarged the territory later named Poland by incorporating Masovia and conquering Silesia and the Vistulan lands of Lesser Poland.

The Dagome iudex document refers to Poland during Mieszko&#x27;s reign as Civitas Schinesghe (The Gniezno State). The document describes the country as stretching between the Oder and Rus and between Lesser Poland (&quot;Craccoa&quot;/&quot;Alemure&quot;) and the Baltic Sea. For more information, see Poland in the Early Middle Ages and History of Poland during the Piast dynasty.

Archeological findings reveal four major strongholds or gords (Polish &quot;gród&quot;) in the early Polans&#x27; state:
* Giecz – the place from where the Piasts gained control over other groups of Polans.
* Poznań – the largest and probably the main stronghold in the state.
* Gniezno – probably the religious centre of the state, although archeological findings proving this have not been excavated so far.
* Ostrów Lednicki – smaller stronghold halfway between Poznań and Gniezno.

The Western Polans were first mentioned around the year AD 1000. Eastern Polans, a similarly named Eastern Slavic tribe which lived near modern-day Kyiv were last documented in AD 944.

<doc id="945404" wikidata="Q191337" url="?curid=945404" title="Ferenc Gyurcsány">
<text>Ferenc Gyurcsány (; born 4 June 1961) is a Hungarian entrepreneur and politician who served as Prime Minister of Hungary from 2004 to 2009. Prior to that, he held the position of Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports between 2003 and 2004.

He was nominated as prime minister by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) on 25 August 2004, after Péter Medgyessy resigned due to a conflict with the Socialist Party&#x27;s coalition partner. Gyurcsány was elected prime minister on 29 September 2004 in a parliamentary vote (197 yes votes, 12 no votes, with most of the opposition in Parliament not voting). He led his coalition to victory in the 2006 parliamentary election, securing another term as prime minister.

On 24 February 2007, he was elected as the leader of the MSZP, winning 89% of the vote. On 21 March 2009, Gyurcsány announced his intention to resign as prime minister. President László Sólyom stated that instead of a short-term government ruling only until the 2010 elections, early elections should be held. On 28 March 2009 Gyurcsány resigned from his position as party chairman. A minister under Gyurcsány, Gordon Bajnai, became the nominee of MSZP for the post of prime minister in March 2009 and he became prime minister on 14 April.

In October 2011, Gyurcsány and other party members quit the MSZP to establish the Democratic Coalition (DK) under his leadership.

==Early years==
Gyurcsány was born in Pápa, Hungary, into an impoverished middle-class family as the only son of Ferenc Gyurcsány Sr. and Katalin Varga.

He has an elder sister, Éva. According to contemporary police documents, Gyurcsány&#x27;s father was convicted on charges of minor crimes (low value thefts and fraud) multiple times. 

Gyurcsány attended Apáczai Csere János High School in Budapest for two years; he then returned to Pápa, Hungary and continued his studies there, at a local grammar school.

In 1979, he was admitted to the University of Pécs, where he studied as a teacher and obtained his B.Sc. in 1984, then he studied economics at the same institution, getting his degree in 1990.

In 1981, he assumed function in the KISZ, the Organisation of Young Communists, where he mostly handled organizing student programs at the beginning. Between 1984 and 1988, he was the vice president of the organisation&#x27;s committee in Pécs. Then between 1988 and 1989, he was the president of the central KISZ committee of universities and colleges. After the political change in 1989, he became vice-president of the organisation&#x27;s short-lived quasi successor, the Hungarian Democratic Youth Association (DEMISZ).

From 1990 onwards, he transferred from the public to the private sector. Gyurcsány then took the position of CEO at Altus Ltd., a holding company of which he was owner, from 1992 to 2002 and thereafter as chairman of the board. By 2002, he was listed as the fiftieth-richest person in Hungary.

==Return to politics==
Gyurcsány returned to politics in 2002 as the head strategic advisor of Péter Medgyessy, the previous prime minister of Hungary. From May 2003 until September 2004 Gyurcsány was a minister responsible for sports, youth and children.

He became the president of the MSZP in Győr-Moson-Sopron county in January 2004, serving until September 2004. In the summer of that same year it seemed that there were larger problems in his relationship with Prime Minister Péter Medgyessy, so he resigned as minister. In a week, problems in the coalition led to the resignation of Medgyessy, and MSZP voted Gyurcsány to become prime minister as he was acceptable for the coalition partner, Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ).

==Prime minister== 

Gyurcsány was reappointed as prime minister after the 2006 parliamentary elections, with his coalition taking 210 of the available 386 parliamentary seats, and making him the first Hungarian prime minister to keep the office after a general election since 1990.

On 24 February 2007, he also became the leader of his party (being the only candidate for the post), gaining 89% of the votes.

However, soon after the election victory serious financial problems arose. His government was forced to implement austerity measures to somehow manage the budget deficit, which was much higher than expected and had grown to an almost 10% of the GDP by the end of 2006. These measures were heavily criticized by both the opposition, led by Fidesz, as being too harsh on the people, and by liberal economists, for not reducing spending enough on social benefits, including pensions.

=== The Őszöd Speech and the resulting protests===
On 17 September 2006, an audio recording surfaced, allegedly from a closed-door meeting of the Prime Minister&#x27;s party MSZP, held on 26 May 2006, shortly after MSZP won the election. On the recording, Gyurcsány admitted &quot;we have obviously been lying for the last one and a half to two years.&quot; (&quot;&quot;Nyilvánvalóan végighazudtuk az utolsó másfél-két évet&quot;.&quot;). Despite public outrage, the Prime Minister refused to resign, and a series of demonstrations started near the Hungarian Parliament, swelling from 2,000 to about 8,000 demonstrators calling for the resignation of Gyurcsány and his government for several weeks. The Prime Minister admitted the authenticity of the recording.
On 1 October, the governing party suffered a landslide defeat in the local municipal elections. On the eve of the elections, before the results were known, President László Sólyom gave a speech in which he said that the solution to the situation is in the hands of the majority in Parliament.

===Vote of confidence===
As Prime Minister, Gyurcsány was a strong advocate of the South Stream pipeline project, which aimed to supply Russian gas directly to the European Union (EU), bypassing transit countries such as Ukraine. He signed the contract in Moscow just a week before the popular election in Hungary, which showed around 80% of the votes were against the government reforms.

On 6 October 2006, Gyurcsány won a vote of confidence in Parliament, 207–165, with no coalition MP voting against him. The vote was public.

===Resignation===
On 21 March 2009, Gyurcsány announced his intention to resign as prime minister. He stated that he was a hindrance to further economic and social reforms. Gyurcsány asked his party to find a new candidate for prime minister in two weeks. President László Sólyom stated that instead of a short-term transactional government ruling only until the 2010 elections, early elections should be held. In the search for a new prime minister, György Surányi became the frontrunner candidate for the post; however, on 26 March he pulled out of the race. On 28 March, Gyurcsány resigned from his position as party chairman.

==Career after premiership==
In the 2010 parliamentary elections he was elected into the Parliament still as a member of MSZP, but he became more and more critical of the party&#x27;s politics. Since his attempts at reforming the party failed, he left MSZP and founded a new party, the Democratic Coalition &quot;(Demokratikus Koalíció, DK)&quot; in October 2011. As a leader of DK, he announced that his party would support Gordon Bajnai as a candidate for prime minister in 2014.

In September 2012, the ruling Fidesz proposed a voter-registration plan, which, according to the opposition, &quot;would have restricted the right to vote&quot;. Gyurcsány and three other members of his party participated in a week-long hunger strike against the proposal. Later, in January 2013, the Constitutional Court of Hungary struck down the new electoral law as unconstitutional; after that decision, Fidesz caucus dropped the law. Gyurcsány referred to that act as his party&#x27;s success.

On 14 January 2014, the Democratic Coalition and four other groups founded Unity, a political alliance with the aim of defeating Fidesz at the elections in the spring. The alliance made it into the Parliament, but only as opposition. DK won only four seats, which meant that since they were below the minimum requirements of forming a parliamentary group (five seats), its MPs (including Gyurcsány) officially count as independent politicians.

On 8 April 2018, the Democratic Coalition won nine seats, creating now a political group in the National Assembly.

In the 2019 European elections, his party got 16% of the vote and became the largest opposition party.

==Personal life==

Gyurcsány is currently married to his third wife. He has two sons (Péter and Bálint) from his second marriage with Edina Bognár, and three children (Anna, Tamás and Márton) from his third marriage. His spouse is Klára Dobrev, whose maternal grandfather Antal Apró was Hungary&#x27;s Minister of Industry in the 1950s–60s.

He got his nickname &quot;Fletó&quot; from his elementary school Russian language teacher. 

==Criticism==
===Wealth===
The origin of Gyurcsány&#x27;s wealth was regularly questioned by the media and the Fidesz opposition at the time. In 2006 the weekly paper &quot;HVG&quot; wrote about a biography of Gyurcsány: &quot;[it] concludes that talent played a greater role than corruption in Gyurcsány&#x27;s success. We have to question this claim. Not just because former functionaries are massively overrepresented among Gyurcsány&#x27;s business partners, but also because, despite his enormous talent for business, Gyurcsány would never have got where he is today without making use of the contacts and support base of the former state party.&quot; József Debreczeni, the biographer in question, originally reached the conclusion &quot;regarding party connections and performance, the latter has been more important&quot;.

In 1999, MP Péter Szijjártó (of Fidesz, an opposition party at that time), as the head of a committee set up to investigate the origins of Gyurcsány&#x27;s wealth, stated in his report that one of Gyurcsány&#x27;s companies leased the former vacation site of the Hungarian government in Balatonőszöd and rented the site back to a state-owned company so that the rent paid by the government covered exactly the leasing fee during the first two and a half years of the ten-year lease term (1994–2004).

A person named &quot;Gyurcsányi&quot; was mentioned by Attila Kulcsár, the main defendant in a high-profile &quot;K&amp;H Equities&quot; money laundering scandal in Hungary. The prime minister denied he had any connections with the case.

===Plagiarism controversy===

In an article published on 2 April 2012, &quot;Pécsi Újság&quot; called into question whether Gyurcsány submitted a diploma thesis. István Geresdi, Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Pécs told &quot;Pécsi Újság&quot; that they were unable to find Gyurcsány&#x27;s diploma thesis. He further added that Gyurcsány&#x27;s thesis was the only missing work from that time period. On 3 April Gyurcsány published a page from his course record book that stated that he submitted and defended a college thesis. He also stated that he did not know where his own copy of his thesis was, but he would make efforts to locate and publish it. After two weeks, on 13 April he announced that he failed to find his copy of the thesis. On 27 April &quot;Hír TV&quot;, a government-leaning television channel announced that they have found evidence that Szabolcs Rozs, who was Gyurcsány&#x27;s brother-in-law in 1984, submitted a college thesis at the same college and department as Gyurcsány, with a title identical to Gyurcsány&#x27;s work, in 1980. Three days later, on 30 April &quot;Hír Tv&quot; announced that they have located and compared the reviews of both Rozs&#x27;s and Gyurcsány&#x27;s work, and found that based on the common errors and omissions, the two texts are likely to be identical, supporting the allegations of plagiarism.

===Other===

On 2 September 2004, he said in the Hungarian national television: &quot;Who has a two-room-apartment, would in general deserve three; who has three, four; who has four, a house. Who has an eld..., olderly, elderly?... olderly &quot;[struggling with an unintended portmanteau]&quot; wife, a younger one; who has a badly behaved kid, a well-behaved. Of course, he would deserve.&quot; This triggered outrage from feminist organisations, women in general, and the opposition.

On 2 February 2005, at the birthday party of the Hungarian Socialist Party, for the sake of a joke, Gyurcsány referred to the players of the Saudi national football team as terrorists. Later he apologized, but the kingdom recalled its ambassador from Hungary for a time.

During the 2006 general election campaign, a video appeared where Gyurcsány danced as Hugh Grant in &quot;Love Actually&quot;. According to government officials, the spokesperson of the government asked Gyurcsány to dance, as they re-made most parts of the film as a special gift for the wedding of spokesman András Batiz. Opposition claimed that the video was made public on purpose, as part of the election campaign, to gain popularity for the PM among young adults.

After his return to politics, Gyurcsány was at first tight-lipped on his religious affiliation, leading many to assume that he is an atheist. In an interview aired on TV2 during the 2006 parliamentary election campaign, Gyurcsány said that as a teenager, he &quot;took part in confirmation for about two years&quot; and even considered becoming a priest. Since confirmation can only be taken once, some regarded this claim as a giveaway that he was not telling the truth, while others such as Catholic bishop Endre Gyulay supposed he meant he took part in preparations for a confirmation.

In connection with the unrest fuelled by his speech, he has been criticised in &quot;The Economist&quot; for &quot;turning a blind eye to police brutality&quot;.

On 13 January 2009, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, travelled to Budapest to ask Gyurcsány about their agreement made in October, regarding the stabilization of Hungarian government spending.

His legitimacy was often questioned by opposition parties based on his withholding of information about the actual budget deficit in his 2006 re-election campaign.

===Russia Pipeline===
As a prime minister, Gyurcsány was said to be an advocate of the South Stream pipeline project, which is aimed to supply Russian gas directly to the EU, bypassing transit countries such as Ukraine. He signed the contract in Moscow just week before a referendum in Hungary, which showed around 80% of the votes were against the government reforms. However, the questions of the referendum (two concerning health care and one concerning education) had no relation to the issue of possible pipelines built in the country. Gyurcsány stated that it is an unlucky situation for a country to have only one supplier (Russia) of any resource, which in this particular case is natural gas. He said the South Stream pipeline only diversifies routes from the same source country. He also advocated the Nabucco Pipeline which was planned to transfer gas from the Middle-East, as he considered this as a pipeline which diversifies the source of natural gas also.

<doc id="945405" wikidata="Q42120" url="?curid=945405" title="Anyang, Gyeonggi">
<text>Anyang (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. With a population of approximately 600,000, it is the 20th largest city in South Korea. It is a satellite city of Seoul and located approximately south of Seoul, and north of Suwon. It is connected to Seoul via the Seoul Subway Line 1 and Line 4. The City motto of Anyang is &quot;Livable city, Proud citizens&quot;. City symbols are a grape mascot named &#x27;Podong-i&#x27;, Forsythia (flower), Ginkgo (tree), and eagles.

==Geography==
Anyang is divided into two-halves for administrative purposes: the Manan District to the west and Dongan District to the east. The Manan District is an old and original downtown area centered on Anyang Station. It is dominated by a shopping area with outdoor markets, known as &quot;ilbeonga&quot; (first street). The Dongan District is a new, wealthy suburb of Pyeongchon. The tallest building in Anyang is the Acro Tower, which was completed in April 2007. It is a twin-tower office building in the Dongan District, across the street from Anyang City Hall. Anyang is a convenient transportation center between Seoul and other major cities across the country.

Anyang spans . Forest and fields constitute , urban development constitutes , dry fields constitute , rice paddies constitutes , and other land use constitutes . Anyang is surrounded by mountains on all four sides. These mountains are Gwanak Mountain and Samsung Mountain to the north, Suri Mountain to the southwest, and Cheongye Mountain and Morak Mountain to the other sides. There are eight streams and rivers in Anyang, with a length of .

The main river is Anyang River (one of the four main tributaries of the Han River in Seoul), which is long. It has a basin area of , fed by 21 tributaries. The center of the overall elliptical basin topography is low and flat. The river runs through the center of Anyang and is a common place for people to walk, jog, or ride bikes. The river flows through seven cities in Gyeonggi Province. This, however, has caused major issues with pollution. River banks are often covered with parking lots or athletic fields, combined with poor sewerage systems in the upper reaches of the river. As a result, the Anyang Stream Watershed Management Committee for Water Quality Improvement had been established to address some of these issues.

Between 1974 and 1977, Samduck paper and Samyoung hardboard factories poured industrial waste into the Suam and Samseong Rivers (two of the tributaries of Anyang River), causing the rivers to become toxic. This pollution was serious, and local residents dug pools to collect the industrial waste, producing a large, damp paper slab at the base of the pools. Local elder women citizens cut out the paper slabs into blocks that were sold back to Samduck; the remaining residues from the drying process were kept and used as fire fuel by the residents during winter. The &quot;owner of Samduck recently donated his factory ground to the city as a gesture of compensation to the citizens of Anyang&quot;. In November 2008, the site reopened as a city park.

===Climate===
Anyang has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm. Anyang has very cold and dry in winter and hot and humid in summer. However, Anyang is cooler than Seoul in summer. The average annual temperature is 12.3 °C, while the average rainfall is 1,344 mm. Around two-thirds of Anyang&#x27;s rainfall occurs during monsoon season between June and August.


==History==
The name Anyang originates from Anyang mall which was established by Wang Geon, the first king of Goryeo. In the fourth year of Hyōgong, king of Silla (900), Wang Geon, a general of Gung Ye, was passing through Samsung Mountain to quell the rebellion in the Gumju (Siheung) and Gwaju (Gwacheon) areas. During their travels, the troops met an old Buddhist priest named Neungjung, and while listening to the priest, Wang Geon had the idea of building a temple at the location. Anyang itself is a Buddhist term signifying a heavenly land where unimaginable joy and freedom overflow.

As with most towns and cities in South Korea, Anyang has experienced tremendous urban growth during the past few decades. Anyang was severely battered by warfare during the Korean War. Ten years after it ended, the area&#x27;s population was still largely rural and its landscape agricultural. It was well known for its grape growing. Anyang was given city status in 1973 and has grown to become the 15th most populated city in the country. It is also becoming a commuter city for many workers in Seoul because of its close proximity.

===Modern history===
*1963: A ferry sank near Seoul drowning 37 children and 12 adults, the majority of whom were school children from Anyang who were returning from a picnic.
*1964: Three people were killed and 100 injured in an explosion of artillery duds in an Anyang workshop.
*1973: Anyang is granted city status.
*1977: A flood devastates the Seoul region killing 335, including 148 in Anyang and adjacent areas. Anyang Technical College opens.
*1988: On March 25, 22 female workers died after a fire broke out at the Green Hill Textile Company.
*1991: Police forced their way into Anyang Prison Hospital to retrieve the body of Labour Leader Park Chang-soo who they believed had committed suicide by leaping from a window. It took nine hours to get past the 1,500 protesters who were protecting the body in the belief that he had been murdered and that the police were trying to consist a cover-up.
*1995: Former South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan was placed in Anyang Prison as he was to be indicted on charges stemming from a 1979 mutiny.
*1997: Chun Doo-hwan is freed from Anyang Prison.
*2001: Anyang officials tell Komachi Japan they will not accept seventeen Komachi exchange students due to distorted content of Japanese text books on the Korean War.
*2007: In September, 23 Korean hostages, held captive by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan, are freed and upon their arrival are taken to Sam Anyang Hospital. Hye-jin Lee, 11, and her friend Ye-seul Woo, 8, went missing on Christmas Day in Anyang. Lee&#x27;s body was found on a mountain in Suwon 77 days after the children went missing.
*2013: The 12th Anyang Citizens Festival was held in Pyeongchon Central Park. This festival celebrated Anyang&#x27;s 40th anniversary as a city.

==Demographics==

===City plans===
In early 2010, previous Anyang mayor, Phil-woon Lee announced plans to build a 100-storey city hall. It was thought that it could house a hotel, cinemas, shopping complexes and other facilities. However, the plans garnered negative responses from both central government and local residents, as several other local governments recently built new city hall at great tax payer expense.

Other recent major redevelopment plans have taken down several buildings in Anyang, particularly the Manan Gu area&#x27;s run down apartment buildings on highly valued land within walking distance of Anyang Station.

===Jobs and industry===
Many workers from Seoul are residents in Anyang, commuting daily between Anyang and Seoul. There are 1,194 companies based in Anyang.

An area encompassing a 3 km section from Myunghak Station to Indeogwon Station to Kwanak-ro was appointed as &#x27;Anyang Venture Valley&#x27; in November 2001 as a part of an effort to support venture companies. There are currently 6,300 people working in 238 company and venture company facilities including Anyang K-Center and Manan Venture Center, Pyongchon IT Venture Center, Kumkang Venturetel and Delta Venture Center.

==Arts==
Anyang City Hall has a project named &#x27;Anyang Art City 21 Project&#x27; which aims to create &quot;a beautiful city, an art city and a well-being city by adding virtuosity to the exterior of city buildings and harmonizing the city sight with natural environment&quot;.

Anyang also has the country&#x27;s only Singing Road, which is made from grooves cut into the ground, which driven over causes a tactile vibration and audible rumbling transmitted through the wheels into the car body. Drivers can hear the tune of &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;, and the road is intended to help motorists stay alert and awake.

==Attractions and tourism==
There are many museums, parks and ancient remains in Anyang, although due to its location and relatively low profile Anyang does not attract many international tourists. The majority of visitors to Anyang&#x27;s attractions are either domestic travelers or local residents. The main hotels in Anyang are Samwon Plaza Tourist Hotel, Sogno Hotel, Koam Tourist Hotel, the Anyang Blue Monte Resort &amp; Youth Hostel all located in Manan Gu, and Central Tourist Hotel in Dongan District.

The Anyang History Museum is located in Galsan-dong, Dongan District, with the major theme of the museum being the displaying of the history and culture of the Anyang area. A site featuring the banner poles from a Joongcho temple is located in Manan Gu. They are the only banner poles in Korea from the period 827AD, and are so unique that they are designated national treasure no. 4. Anyang also hosts the collected writings of Toegye Lee Hwang (1501–1570), which were written to teach his follower Kwon Ho-Mun how to write (national treasure no. 548). Anyang also possesses dozens of nationally recognised &#x27;tangible assets&#x27; including Manan Bridge, and the Maaejong rock engraving of a bell from the end of the Silla period. In addition, Anyang contains the tombstone of Park Suh, a civil servant in the middle Joseon period, as well as dolmens in Pyeongchon, a stone chambered grave in Bisan dong, and a letter engraved in stone by Ji Woon Yong at Sammak Temple.

===City festival===
Anyang hosts four festivals to coincide with the four seasons. The Spring festival begins at the end of May and is focussed around Anyang River. It is made up of a series of performances and &quot;ecological experiences&quot; alongside the river. The Summer festival takes place at the end of August at Pyeongchon Central Park and Byeongmokan Citizen Park. It involves a festival of wind instruments with contests, invitation performances and a parade. The Fall festival is at the beginning of October and takes place at Pyeongchon Central Park.

===Parks===

As of 2007 there were 97 listed parks in Anyang covering an area of 1,347 square metres.

The main parks in Anyang are Anyang Art Park, Anyang Central Park, Jayu Park (Freedom Park) which is south of Hagwon-ga and contains tennis courts and statues of important figures in the Korean independence movement, the Pyeongchon Art Hall, the Children&#x27;s Traffic Park, Hakwoon Park, Hogye Park, Byongmokan Civic Park, Seoksu Sports Park, Chunghun Park, and the Changbakgol water reservoir sports park.

During the weekend the street dividing the park is closed for a flea market.

==Crime==
In 2007 there were 16,311 reported cases of crime in Anyang. There were 13,771 arrests made during the same year. In 2008, there were 20,854 crimes. The following year, there were 16,990 crimes. However, the recent installation of new CCTV has led to the crime rate decreasing.

==Pollution==
In 2013, Anyang (along with Busan) was listed as one of the most polluted cities (in terms of air pollution) in the world&#x27;s largest economies, with nearly 70 micrograms of particulate matter of less than 10 micron size per cubic meter.

From 2016 to now, the construction of GS cogeneration system lead to many conflicts between GS and the residents living near Pyeongchon-Dong. Many people believe that the power plant increases air pollution, which is already a heavy issue in Korea.

==Facilities==

===Housing===
A huge redevelopment is proposed for the Manan Gu area, beginning in late 2010, with the focus on urban renewal. The proposal would see the building of approximately 24,000 apartment units built over an area of 1,776,000 m2 and see the destruction and redevelopment of the area around Anyang Station. The Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University, in conjunction with the Anyang Public Art Project 2010, has had its students working on concept plans and designs for the redevelopment of the Hogye Apartments in Dongan Gu.

===Hospitals===
Anyang has many medical facilities, including four general hospitals (Metro Hospital, Sam Anyang Hospital, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital and Hansung Hospital), five hospitals, 331 clinics, 191 dental clinics, 141 oriental medical hospitals, two health centres and two long-term care hospitals.

==Transportation==
Anyang is well served by bus, subway and rail services. The intercity bus terminal is located directly opposite Anyang Station which was first opened in January 1905. It was rebuilt into a large, modern building, which reopened in December 2001 and is adjacent to Lotte Department Store. It takes approximately 40 minutes on line one from Anyang to Seoul Station. There are six other stations in Anyang: Myeonghak, Gwanak and Seoksu, and Beomgye, Pyeongchon and Indeogwon, the first three on line one and the latter three on line four.

===Railroad===

While technically not in Anyang itself, the Gwangmyeong Station is located less than 10 minutes drive to the northwest of Anyang Station and essentially exists to service Anyang and other nearby cities. Thus, when using KTX, Gwangmyeong Station or Suwon Station is useful.

===Road and automobiles===
In 2007 there were 188,423 vehicles registered in Anyang. During the same year there were 1,351 recorded automobile accidents resulting in 32 deaths, and 2,150 injuries. There were also 59,185 traffic offences recorded in 2007, the majority of which were committed by passenger vehicles (39,773).

<text>Superman – Ride of Steel is a steel roller coaster based on the DC Comics character Superman at two Six Flags theme parks in the United States. Both hypercoasters were manufactured by Intamin and feature identical layouts, opening one year apart; Six Flags Darien Lake in 1999 and Six Flags America in 2000. The roller coaster at Six Flags Darien Lake, was renamed in 2007, to Ride of Steel, dropping the character theme, when the company sold the park. (Six Flags Darien Lake was brought back to Six Flags, and has yet added any theme to the coaster.)

Both roller coasters are tall, feature a drop length of , and reach a maximum speed of .

==Installations==
==VR experience==
On March 3, 2016, Six Flags announced that the ride would be one of several rides at various Six Flags parks to feature a VR system. Riders have the option of wearing a Samsung Gear VR headset, powered by Oculus to create a 360-degree, 3D experience while riding. It is themed to Superman saving a city from Lex Luthor&#x27;s Lex Bots who are causing chaos with an anti-gravity ray. This theming was also added to at Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Superman The Ride at Six Flags New England.

==Ride layout==
Once the train has been dispatched from the station it makes a winding, 180-degree turn. The train ascends up the lift hill and then drops at an angle of 68 degrees. The train reaches the maximum speed of before entering a sharp turn and the first airtime hill. A 540-degree helix follows, in addition to another smaller airtime hill. The finale involves a 500-degree helix and several more airtime hills before reaching the brake run and returning to the station.

===Elements===
* 5 airtime hills (4 airtime hills and a twisted airtime hill)
* 2 helixes (540 degree and 500 degree)

==Rankings==


==Incidents==
* On May 16, 1999, a passenger was thrown from the train at the Darien Lake installment on one of the final hills and suffered minor injuries.
* On July 8, 2011, a disabled Iraq War veteran who lost both legs during his deployment in Iraq died after being ejected from the front seat of the Darien Lake coaster. The state&#x27;s Department of Labor cited &quot;operator error&quot; as the cause of the accident and issued two violations, in which the park responded by retraining staff and updating ride safety signage before reopening the ride. A final report from the local sheriff&#x27;s office detailed the negligence by employees, who should have been aware that the restraints required passengers to have both legs. Witnesses reported seeing the disabled vet reaching for his hat that flew off before he was ejected, and evidence suggested that the rider died instantly from blunt force trauma to the head when he came in contact with the front of a train car.

<doc id="945415" wikidata="Q749645" url="?curid=945415" title="Joseph-Édouard Cauchon">
<text>Joseph-Édouard Cauchon, (; December 31, 1816 – February 23, 1885) was a prominent Quebec politician in the middle years of the nineteenth-century. Although he held a variety of portfolios at the federal, provincial and municipal levels, he never achieved his goal of becoming the Premier of Quebec.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Quebec City to a well-established family of seigneurs, Joseph-Édouard&#x27;s parents were Joseh Cauchon, a joiner, and Marguerite Vallée.

Cauchon received a classical education at the Petit Séminaire of Quebec from 1830 to 1839, and subsequently studied law.

== Early career ==
He was called to the Quebec bar in 1843, but never practised. Instead he turned to journalism, working for &quot;Le Canadien&quot; from 1841 to 1842, and launching his own &quot;Le Journal de Québec&quot; in December of the latter year. This paper was known for its sharp political wit and generally supported Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine&#x27;s French Canadian Reformers during its early years.

In 1841, he published an elementary treatise of physics entitled &quot;Notions élémentaires de physique, avec planches à l&#x27;usage des maisons d&#x27;éducation&quot;.

== Political career ==
Cauchon himself entered political life in 1844, winning election for the riding of Montmorency in the Province of Canada&#x27;s legislature. He defeated a Mr. Taschereau by 475 votes to 147, and sat with Lafontaine&#x27;s French Canadian group on the opposition benches for the next three years.

Lafontaine&#x27;s party won a major victory in 1847, and Cauchon was re-elected by acclamation. He did not, however, join the cabinet of Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin.

Cauchon supported the union of Canada East and Canada West as a guarantor of rights for both regions and sought to have the bilingual Augustin-Norbert Morin elected as speaker of the provincial legislature. When Francis Hincks replaced Lafontaine as Premier in 1851, Cauchon&#x27;s position was one of ambivalence. He opposed Hincks&#x27;s alliance with the Clear Grit faction (which he described as &quot;socialist and anticatholic&quot;), and turned down Hincks&#x27;s offer to become assistant Provincial Secretary. While he did not abandon the Reform cause entirely, his newspapers&#x27;s criticisms of the Hincks government weakened the ministry&#x27;s position in Quebec.

Cauchon was himself re-elected in 1851 and 1854, defeating one Mr. Glackemeyer by 883 votes to 529 on the latter occasion. His political position in 1854 was ambiguous, and he held some hopes of replacing Hincks as a coalitionist Premier when the overall results proved inconclusive. He abandoned this plan, however, to support the alliance of Allan Napier McNab&#x27;s Conservatives with the French Canadian bloc (then led by Morin) and a part of Hincks&#x27;s Reform group. In the year that followed, Cauchon supported the government&#x27;s decisions to eliminate the seigneurial system (over Louis-Joseph Papineau&#x27;s objections) and secularize the clergy reserves. In 1855, he introduced a bill to make the Legislative Council elective; this was passed into law, and came into effect the following year.

Later in 1855, Cauchon was appointed to the McNab–Étienne-Paschal Taché cabinet as Commissioner of Crown Lands. He resigned in April 1857, when his government refused to allocate funds for a railway on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River. Cauchon remained a member of the Parti bleu, however, and was re-elected in the general election of 1857.

Cauchon voted against his party on some occasions in 1858, and spoke out against its early support of Canadian Confederation. Nevertheless, he was appointed in 1861 as Minister of Public Works in the George-Étienne Cartier-Macdonald cabinet, and held this position until the Cartier-Macdonald government was defeated in the house the following year. Cauchon was returned by acclamation in the general election of 1861, and defeated a Mr. Tourangeau by 526 votes to 367 in 1863.

When the Conservatives returned to power in March 1864, Cauchon was again chosen as Public Works minister. He was forced to resign this position after the creation of a &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; ministry in August, though he continued to support the government from the back benches. Despite his previous opposition, he also emerged as a leading supporter of the confederation plan. In 1865, he published (in French and English) a work entitled &quot;The union of the provinces of British North America&quot;, which rejected his earlier opposition to the plan.

While retaining his seat in parliament, Cauchon also served as mayor of Quebec City from 1865 to 1867. It is difficult to determine what he accomplished, as he never published a report during this period.

After Confederation was achieved in July 1867, Cauchon was called upon to become the first Premier of Quebec. He was unable to accomplish this task, however, as his plans to include an anglophone in cabinet broke down on the issue of educational funding for the province&#x27;s Protestant minority. Cauchon opposed the creation of a Protestant Superintendency for the province, while all of his potential anglophone ministers supported it. Accordingly, Cauchon stood aside, and Pierre Chauveau became the province&#x27;s first Premier instead. Despite this setback, Cauchon was re-elected for Montmorency to both the federal and provincial parliaments later in the year.
Rejected in his bid to become Quebec Premier, Cauchon still sought higher office. In October 1867, he demanded that the Conservative government appoint him to the Senate of Canada, and allow him to be chosen as its first speaker. Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau was accordingly convinced to resign his Senate seat, and Cauchon took his place on November 2, 1867, becoming speaker three days later. His appointment was extremely unpopular with senators from both parties, and Cauchon subsequently identified himself as an &quot;Independent Conservative&quot;. The affair may have contributed to Cauchon&#x27;s defeat at the hands of John Lemesurier in a bid for re-election as Quebec City&#x27;s Mayor one month later. Despite the unpopularity of his appointment, Cauchon remained Speaker of the Senate until June 30, 1872 (though he stepped down on a temporary basis on two occasions, for eleven days in total). While in Ottawa he lived in Stadacona Hall in Sandy Hill.

Cauchon was re-elected by acclamation to the Quebec assembly in 1871 and resigned his Senate seat in 1872 to run for the House of Commons again. This time running in Quebec Centre, he was opposed by an Anglophone Protestant named James Gibb Ross. The resulting election was divided on sectarian lines, and was extremely violent. Cauchon won by 964 votes to 694; he returned to parliament as an Independent Conservative and was not specifically aligned with either party.

In 1873, Cauchon wanted to replace N. F. Belleau as lieutenant governor of Quebec, but was rejected by the Macdonald government due to his large number of enemies. He also wanted to become Quebec leader of the federal Conservative party after Cartier&#x27;s death, but was too unpopular within the party. Following these rejections, he began to align himself with the opposition Liberals, joining the party when the Pacific Scandal brought down Macdonald&#x27;s government later in the year. Cauchon resigned his seat in the Quebec legislature in February 1874 when his &quot;dual mandate&quot; became illegal, and thereafter focused his attentions on federal advancement.

Cauchon&#x27;s presence in the Liberal Party was a matter of convenience for both sides. Cauchon provided the Liberals with a link to various Catholic concerns in Quebec, and helped the party rebuild a provincial network. In return, Cauchon was appointed to cabinet as President of the Privy Council on December 7, 1875. Liberal Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie subsequently wanted to promote him to Minister of Justice, but was unable to do so because of divisions in the party. Cauchon was, however, promoted to Minister of Inland Revenue on June 8, 1877.

As before, Cauchon was a leading source of division in his party. Wilfrid Laurier emerged as a leading opponent of Cauchon among the Quebec Liberals, and was successful in having him removed from cabinet in October 1877. As compensation, Cauchon was appointed the third Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, replacing the retiring Alexander Morris.

Cauchon&#x27;s appointment was met with apprehension among Manitoba&#x27;s anglophone residents. The province&#x27;s population was divided on ethnic, linguistic and religious lines at the time, and there was often strong antagonism between members of different communities. Many within Manitoba&#x27;s majority anglophone population believed that Cauchon would refuse to uphold their legal rights. This supposition proved false, but Cauchon still reserved approval of an 1878 bill that eliminated the printing of government legislation in French.

While the previous lieutenant governors of Manitoba had been interventionist figures, Cauchon was generally content to assume a more ceremonial role. This was a reflection of the province&#x27;s political maturity and its ability to govern without direction from its formal executive.

Cauchon&#x27;s term ended on December 1, 1882, although he remained in Manitoba after this time. Already wealthy from his business activities in Quebec, he had made a further fortune on railway speculation in the western province (estimates of his earnings range from half a million to a million dollars). He was caught in a market downturn just as his term in office came an end, however, and was forced to sell his luxurious Winnipeg mansion in 1884. He then moved to the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley (in modern Saskatchewan), and lived in somewhat reduced circumstances until his death the following year.
