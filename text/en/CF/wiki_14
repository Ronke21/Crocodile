<text>MC Skat Kat is an animated cat character who appeared with Paula Abdul in the video for her song &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; in 1989.

==History==
MC Skat Kat was created by Michael Patterson and performed by the Wild Pair duo of Bruce DeShazer and Marv Gunn on &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;. MC Skat Kat&#x27;s rap was written and performed by Derrick Stevens, although Romany Malco, who did the majority of the writing for the M.C. Skat Kat &amp; the Stray Mob album, is often mistakenly credited for being the voice of the rap on Opposites Attract, a story perpetuated by Abdul herself. Derrick Stevens also provided vocals for the character in the MC Skat Kat solo album.

Patterson got the idea for Skat Kat from the Gene Kelly movie &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, in which Kelly&#x27;s character dances with Jerry, the mouse from the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; franchise. Patterson would originally play small gigs dressed in full cat attire, though soon after become a studio musician with the character becoming fully animated by members of the Disney and Warner Bros. animation team, working outside the studios between major projects, under the direction of Chris Bailey.

The character released the album &quot;The Adventures of MC Skat Kat and the Stray Mob&quot; in 1991 on Kings Records. Paula Abdul made an appearance in the music video of the only single &quot;Skat Strut&quot;. The single peaked at No. 80 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in late October 1991, and stayed on the chart for four weeks. &quot;Skat Strut&quot; reached No. 11 on the New Zealand Pop Singles chart, No. 9 on the Norwegian Pop Singles chart, No. 28 on the Dutch Pop Singles chart, No. 31 on the Swedish Pop Singles chart and No. 64 on the UK Singles Chart.

MC Skat Kat also featured in &quot;Yakety Yak, Take It Back&quot;, an all-star public service music video produced by Warner Bros. in 1991 for the Take It Back Foundation. The music video featured appearances by numerous celebrities, along with Bugs Bunny, Melba Moore as both herself and the voice of a butterfly character, and Dr. John as himself and the voice of Yakety Yak, for a new version of the song &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; with a message about recycling.

MC Skat Kat later appeared in &quot;American Dad!&quot; season 11&#x27;s sixth episode &quot;Kiss Kiss Cam Cam&quot;, on February 29, 2016. In said episode, Stan hires Kat to mimic a scene in the Opposites Attract video, with Stan taking Paula’s place to make a point to Klaus about how he and Francine stay with each other in spite of their differences. Klaus interrupts them a little after they started.

MC Skat Kat makes a cameo appearance alongside Abdul in the 2022 film &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;. In the 2023 TV series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, Abdul is seen wearing an MC Skat Kat t-shirt.

==&quot;The Adventures of MC Skat Kat and the Stray Mob&quot;==
The Adventures of MC Skat Kat and the Stray Mob is a 1991 album from MC Skat Kat. The album came about as the result of Paula Abdul&#x27;s successful &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; video of 1990, which was directed by Michael Patterson and Candace Reckinger. The Stray Mob consists of cartoon characters Fatz, Taboo, Micetro, Leo, Katleen, and Silk, the first three of whom appeared in the &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; music video. Two music videos for the album were directed by Patterson and Reckinger, only one of which was released.

The only single from the album, &quot;Skat Strut&quot;, samples Earth Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s 1981 hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Groove&quot;, with Abdul making a brief appearance in the video. Unlike the &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; video, the animation on the &quot;Skat Strut&quot; music video used digital ink and paint. It only reached number 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but fared better overseas, peaking at numbers 9 and 31 on the Norwegian and Swedish charts, respectively. The vocal style and length in the music video differed from those from the album version.

===Reception===

The album was poorly received and it failed to chart. In 1999, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; deemed it the &quot;least essential&quot; album of the 1990s, calling it &quot;a product of clueless committee thinking and Milli Vanilli-style studio hackwork at its most cynical&quot;, and concluding that &quot;never has a mass-produced album been demanded by so few.&quot;

<doc id="941989" wikidata="Q5081057" url="?curid=941989" title="Charles Moore, Baron Moore of Etchingham">
<text>Charles Hilary Moore, Baron Moore of Etchingham (born 31 October 1956) is an English journalist and the chairman of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He is a former editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;; he still writes for all three. He is known for his authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher, published in three volumes (2013, 2016 and 2019). Under the government of Boris Johnson, Moore was given a peerage in July 2020, thus becoming a member of the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Hastings, East Sussex. He is from a Liberal family. His mother Ann (née Miles) was a county councillor for the Liberal Party in Sussex and his father Richard was a leader writer on the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, who unsuccessfully stood for the party at several general elections.

While at Eton in 1974 Moore wrote about his membership of the Liberals in the &quot;Eton Chronicle&quot; and also about his taste for real ale. During this period he was already a friend of Oliver Letwin. Moore remained a Liberal into his early twenties.

Moore went to Trinity College, Cambridge, at the same time as Letwin. At Eton he had also known Nicholas Coleridge, who was also at Trinity. He read English (2.1) and History (2.1) and graduated BA in 1979. By now an advocate of architectural conservation, he became an admirer of the work in this field of Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman.

==Early career==
In 1979, Moore joined &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a political correspondent, and, after a short period on the &#x27;Peterborough&#x27; gossip column, was writing leaders within two years, by the age of 24. In 1982 Moore wrote a pamphlet for the Salisbury Group, titled &quot;The Old People of Lambeth&quot; (1982). In the aftermath of the 1981 Brixton riot (which Moore blamed on &quot;poorly planned mass immigration&quot;) Moore interviewed elderly white residents of Lambeth on their experience of crime, the police, immigration and politics. Moore wrote: &quot;The native population of Lambeth feels little natural sympathy with the West Indian arrivals. Without having any arrogant or dogmatic theory of racial superiority, the old people of Lambeth can see with their own eyes that they are surrounded by people more primitive than they, who lack their respect for law and privacy&quot;. In the final paragraph, Moore wrote of the old people&#x27;s loyalty to the Royal Family, their memories of the two world wars, their work ethic and their readiness to obey the law: &quot;As one old man said simply, &#x27;It&#x27;s our country and our Queen. Why should we be afraid to go out?&#x27;&quot;

In 1992 in an article questioning the success of the welfare policies intended to combat historical social problems, Moore supportively claimed there was a perception in America that some groups might be more able than others, which he then went on to support: &quot;The Korean sets up the grocery store which the black then robs, that is the caricature that America recognises&quot;, and that there was a prejudice often voiced in conversation but hardly ever put into print &quot;that there really is something different about blacks, or at least about young black men&quot; and &quot;If it is true, as it surely is that some races – the Jews are the obvious example – are highly enterprising and talented, it may also be true that some are the opposite.&quot;

In September 2003, Moore launched a new column, Beebwatch, that he claimed would &quot;delve into the unconscious bias&quot; of the corporation. &quot;The BBC&#x27;s mental assumptions are those of the fairly soft left, that American power is a bad thing, whereas the UN is good, that the Palestinians are in the right and Israel isn&#x27;t, that the war in Iraq was wrong, that the European Union is a good thing and that people who criticise it are xenophobic,&quot; Moore said.

==As editor==
===&quot;The Spectator&quot;===
Two years after joining &quot;The Spectator&quot; as a political columnist, Moore became the magazine&#x27;s editor in 1984, remaining there until 1990.

Moore employed a young journalist Boris Johnson at &quot;The Spectator,&quot; who went onto succeed Moore as Editor of the Spectator and then became Mayor of London, Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

Moore co-edited &quot;A Tory Seer: The Selected Journalism of T. E. Utley&quot;, which was published in 1989.

===Editor of the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;===
Following &quot;The Spectator&quot;, he edited &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; from 1992 to 1995. Near the start of this period, around the time of the publication of the Andrew Morton book &quot;Diana: Her True Story&quot;, he appeared on &quot;Newsnight&quot; to discuss the marital difficulties of the Prince and Princess of Wales. To the astonishment of the presenter, Jeremy Paxman, Moore said that because he wished to protect the monarchy: &quot;I believe in the importance of concealment in these matters and, if you like, hypocrisy.&quot;

===Editor of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;===
Moore became editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1995. In 2001, his signed editorial &quot;A Free Country&quot; gained some notice elsewhere in the media. In this article, he argued in favour of hunting, pornography, the right to employ whom we choose, and the right to trial by jury, and advocated the legalisation of cannabis. He blamed a decline in &quot;freedom&quot; on the controls imposed during the Second World War and on Margaret Thatcher: &quot;If you&#x27;ve been in office for a long time you always start to believe in having more power, and she undoubtedly got that disease.&quot;

====False allegations against George Galloway====
Owing to falling circulation, there had been speculation by 2003 about Moore&#x27;s future prior to his resignation in the autumn of that year. Moore had been editor when stories about George Galloway, which led to a successful libel action from the politician, were published. The newspaper had falsely written that Galloway received payments from Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime.

==Later career==
Since leaving the editorship of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2003, to spend more time writing Thatcher&#x27;s authorised biography, Moore has penned regular columns at &quot;The Spectator&quot; and at the &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; and was named in 2023 by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as the fortieth most influential right-wing figure in the UK.

===Chairman of Policy Exchange (?-2011)===
Moore was for a number of years chairman of Policy Exchange, a London-based think-tank, before he stepped down in June 2011. In December 2007 he entered the debate over &quot;The Hijacking of British Islam&quot;, a Policy Exchange report which the BBC had found to rely on evidence that was clearly fabricated. On 17 December 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; issued an apology to Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari of the East London Mosque in connection with its coverage of the report originally defended by Moore.

Policy Exchange did not bring its threatened legal action against the BBC but in September 2008, the Finsbury Park Mosque issued a writ in the High Court over the report&#x27;s allegations. In March 2009, the report appeared to have been removed from the Policy Exchange website, and a correction notice was published. The case came to the High Court in December 2009 but was struck out by the Judge on the basis that the Mosque could not sue for defamation as it was not a corporate entity or legal person.

==Peerage==
On 31 July 2020, Moore was given a life peerage alongside other prominent Brexiters Claire Fox, Kate Hoey, Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Ian Botham. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 17 September 2020, and sits as a non-affiliated member. He made his maiden speech on 23 February 2022.

==Publications==
===Biographer of Margaret Thatcher===
Following the death of Margaret Thatcher on 8 April 2013, during his appearance on the &quot;Question Time&quot; programme three days later, Moore criticised the BBC for giving too much publicity to the Thatcher critics who were celebrating her death. Menzies Campbell accused Moore of suffering from &quot;a persecution complex&quot;. On 17 April, the day of Thatcher&#x27;s funeral, Moore said that parts of the country showing enmity were considered &quot;relatively less important&quot;.

Moore left his post as editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2003 to spend more time writing Thatcher&#x27;s authorised biography. Always intended to be published after her death, the first volume, titled &quot;Not For Turning&quot;, was published in 2013 shortly after her funeral. (The US edition of this initial volume was retitled &quot;Margaret Thatcher, The Authorized Biography: From Grantham to the Falklands.&quot;) Moore does not know exactly why he was chosen to write the biography, but believes it was probably because of his age, and because he was familiar with all the main characters of Thatcher&#x27;s time in government, without being especially strongly linked to any one of them. He was selected by Thatcher, without his prior knowledge, out of a list of names which were presented to her.

The first volume of Moore&#x27;s three-volume work received the £5,000 Elizabeth Longford Prize in 2014.

==Personal life==
Moore married Caroline Baxter (whom he had met at university) in 1981 in Tunbridge Wells. The couple have two children.

Moore converted to Roman Catholicism following the Church of England&#x27;s decision to allow the ordination of women as priests in 1992. His wife, a former English don at Peterhouse, Cambridge, chose not to make such a move, and remains an Anglican.

Moore is the founder-chairman of The Rectory Society, which is dedicated to preserving past and present parsonages. Moore is also a patron of the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales.

==Views==
Moore is a monarchist, and says the monarchy &quot;reaches parts politics cannot reach&quot;. He supported Brexit, and has criticised the BBC&#x27;s Brexit and climate change coverage. In &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 2018 he wrote that &quot;religious freedom is central to all freedoms&quot;. In September 2020, Moore referred to Black Lives Matter as a &quot;Marxist movement whose doctrines about white people are explicitly racist&quot;.

===Critic of the BBC===
Moore is a critic of the BBC, which he believes has a left-wing bias. Moore was fined £262 for not possessing a TV licence in May 2010, eighteen months after announcing that he would donate the amount payable as a television licence to Help the Aged because the BBC had failed to sack Jonathan Ross for his &quot;Sachsgate&quot; prank with Russell Brand. He saw the episode as part of an ongoing &quot;pathology&quot; at the BBC, rather than being an isolated incident.

In December 2019, Moore was a guest editor on the BBC flagship news programme, &quot;Today&quot;, where he invited fellow Global Warming Policy Foundation affiliates Matt Ridley and Michael Kelly to be interviewed in back-to-back editions of the programme also featuring climate activist Greta Thunberg and climate scientist Kevin Anderson. Moore said the BBC was biased against climate change deniers. &quot;Today&quot; host, Nick Robinson, said that the corporation&#x27;s coverage was governed by &quot;Ofcom regulations and the law&quot; and that it reported the &quot;global consensus&quot; on climate science, denying it preached a certain position.

Sir David Clementi, the outgoing chairman of the BBC, warned the government that lining up Moore as his successor would &quot;put off&quot; candidates. Moore was reported to have been the Prime Minister&#x27;s preferred choice for chairman before the position had been advertised. However, since then, Moore has said he decided against applying for personal reasons, although Moore&#x27;s demand for a pay rise over the current salary and discomfort over his previous comments were also reported.

===Criticism of David Cameron===
Moore was a critic of David Cameron&#x27;s Conservative Party modernisation strategy, that he stated embraced &quot;subjects which they had previously ceded to the Left, like health, welfare, the environment and schools&quot;, which he believed had supported the interests of government organisations rather than that of the consumer. In particular, Moore has been critical of the National Health Service, which he considers &quot;a terrible organisation&quot;.

In December 2009, regarding the &quot;Beano&quot; character Lord Snooty, the nickname &quot;Private Eye&quot; uses for Moore, Moore wrote that &quot;he is the ideal role model for David Cameron.&quot; In 2011, after the News International phone hacking scandal became public knowledge, he wondered if the Left had been right all along, not only in their objection to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s power, but also whether &quot;&#x27;the free market&#x27; is actually a set-up.&quot;

==== On the English Defence League ====
In June 2013, Moore said that following the murder of Lee Rigby by Islamic terrorists, the BBC and organisations which monitor attacks against Muslims and anti-Muslim prejudice, such as Tell MAMA, had set a trap &quot;inviting those of us who reject such statements&quot; (i.e. that anti-Muslim prejudice had increased following the attacks) &quot;to defend the [English Defence League]. I do not.&quot; He described the EDL as a &quot;reactive organisation&quot; which &quot;does not – officially at least – support violence&quot;. Moore also said &quot;If we attack the EDL for being racist, fascist and pro-violence, we can do so with impunity, although we are not being strictly accurate&quot; and that &quot;the only serious violence was against a British soldier&quot;. Sadiq Khan said in his response to Moore that &quot;Al-Rahma Islamic Centre had been burnt to the ground, or to the 182 staff and pupils evacuated from the Darul Uloom School in Chiselhurst, traumatised by an arson attack in the middle of the night&quot;.

====On gay rights====
Moore has expressed his view that civil partnerships achieved a &quot;balance&quot; for heterosexual and homosexual couples. In July 2013, Moore wrote that he opposed changing the definition of marriage, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;: &quot;I wonder if the law will eventually be changed to allow one to marry one&#x27;s dog.&quot; In 2015, Moore wrote that a &quot;gay rights sharia&quot; was dictating what the LGBT+ community should believe following Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s openly gay founders criticising gay adoptions. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme had featured Patrick Strudwick, the LGBT editor of Buzzfeed, as a guest. According to Moore, &quot;Strudwick was made furiously righteous by the fact that Dolce himself is gay.&quot; Moore wrote that &quot;If you are gay, Mr Strudwick seemed to assert, there are certain things you must believe. Nothing else is permitted under the gay rights sharia.&quot;

In 2013, he wrote that &quot;Respectable people are truly terrified of being thought anti-homosexual. In a way, they are right to be, because attacking people for their personal preferences can be a nasty thing.&quot; In 2017, Moore opposed banning the pseudoscientific practice of conversion therapy, asking: &quot;Why should they not be entitled to seek escape [from homosexual feelings]?&quot; A partial ban on conversion therapy for England and Wales was later announced in the 2021 Queen&#x27;s Speech.

====On Islam, terrorism and immigration====
In the wake of the June 2015 Sousse attacks, in which 38 Westerners were murdered by an Islamist who had apparently been seduced by an associate of Abu Qatada, Moore wrote an essay the thesis of which was that ISIS and its fellow-travellers truly believe only it can defeat the conspiracy that runs the world and that there is no possible common ground. He concluded that &quot;It is not paranoid to say that there is a deadly enemy within [the UK] and not intolerant to want to defeat it.&quot;

Moore wrote in September 2015 that Muslim immigration meant &quot;more political disturbance, more communal tension, more intolerance of other faiths and more terrorism&quot;.

In January 2017 Moore defended Donald Trump after the President attempted to ban citizens of several Muslim nations entering the US. Moore described the criticisms of Trump as &quot;foaming&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; in an editorial for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

====Alleged sexism====
In August 2015, Moore received media attention and criticism after he wrote an article for &quot;The Spectator&quot; about the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, titled &quot;Have Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall got the looks for a leadership contest?&quot;, in which he wrote &quot;there is an understanding that no leader—especially, despite the age of equality, a woman—can look grotesque on television and win a general election&quot; and discussed the looks of the two female candidates in detail. The article was condemned by Liz Kendall, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and Tessa Jowell, candidate for the Labour nomination for Mayor of London and former Minister and MP, along with several journalists and MPs from various parties.

In August 2019 he was criticised for suggesting that Olivia Colman had a &quot;distinctly leftwing face&quot; which cast a doubt in his mind on her ability to play the role of the Queen in the then-upcoming season of &quot;The Crown&quot;.

===Climate change===
In 2015, Moore was made a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, sanctioned by the Charity Commission, described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as the UK&#x27;s most prominent climate science denial campaign group. Bob Ward the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science has said that the Global Warming Policy Foundation does not disclose its funding and that Moore or his allies at the Foundation do &quot;not declare their affiliation to the Foundation when promoting climate change denial&quot; and that &quot;Moore&#x27;s many articles for &#x27;The Daily Telegraph&#x27; about climate change do not mention his connection&quot;.

In April 2017, he authored an article for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which advocated &quot;a bonfire of green regulations&quot; and a return to fossil fuels to improve the British economy after Brexit.

According to Bob Ward, director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, Moore incorrectly claimed in 2018 that the United States had successfully reduced its CO2 emissions globally and their emissions had hit a 25-year low last year. Ward also claimed that Moore incorrectly claimed that Germany and Japan are increasing their carbon footprint because they have &quot;run away from nuclear&quot;.

<text>Kate McGarrigle (February 6, 1946 – January 18, 2010) was a Canadian folk music singer-songwriter, who wrote and performed as a duo with her sister Anna McGarrigle.

She is the mother of singers Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright from her marriage to American singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, which ended in divorce.

==Early life==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, to Irish pianist Francis McGarrigle and French Canadian mother Gabrielle Latrémouille, the three McGarrigle sisters (Jane, Anna, and Kate, the youngest) grew up in the village of Saint-Sauveur-des-Monts, north of Montreal. Their family was a musical one on both sides, often gathering around the piano and singing, allowing Kate and her sisters to absorb influences as varied as Gershwin, French Canadian folk songs, Stephen Foster, and composer-singers such as Wade Hemsworth and Edith Piaf. The sisters were formally introduced to music by taking piano lessons from the village nuns.

==Career==
In the 1960s Kate and Anna established themselves in Montreal&#x27;s burgeoning folk scene while they attended school. From 1963 to 1967, they teamed up with Jack Nissenson and Peter Weldon to form the folk group, the Mountain City Four.

Anna, who is 14 months older than Kate, studied painting at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal (now part of the Université du Québec à Montréal) in Montreal; McGarrigle studied engineering at McGill University. It was at this time that they began writing songs. Although she sang mostly in English, according to Juan Rodriguez, she and Anna &quot;put Québécois folk music...on the global music map in 1980 with &quot;Complainte pour Ste. Catherine&quot;, &quot;Entre la jeunesse et la sagesse&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;French Record&quot;) and 2003&#x27;s &quot;La vache qui pleure&quot;.&quot;

The McGarrigle sisters&#x27; life has been chronicled in a book by Anna&#x27;s husband, Dane Lanken, titled &quot;Kate and Anna McGarrigle: Songs and Stories&quot;.

Place Kate-McGarrigle was inaugurated on August 7, 2013 in Montreal&#x27;s Outremont borough. It contains a sculpture by Robert Wilson in the form of a double chair. McGarriglea Montreal nativelived nearby before her death.

Her son, Rufus, says he discussed with McGarrigle the offer of his childhood friend, Lorca Cohen, for Rufus to father her child. He says that McGarrigle strongly encouraged him to accept Cohen&#x27;s offer, and that he regrets she didn&#x27;t live long enough to see his daughter Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen&#x27;s birth.

==Awards==
Kate and Anna&#x27;s 1976 self-titled debut album was chosen by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as Best Record of the Year. Their albums &quot;Matapedia&quot; (1996) and &quot;The McGarrigle Hour&quot; (1998) won Juno Awards. In 1999 Kate and Anna received Women of Originality awards. In 1993 she was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

In 2006 Kate and Anna McGarrigle were the recipients of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards.

==Death==
McGarrigle was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and established the Kate McGarrigle Fund at the McGill University Health Centre, which she set up in 2008 to raise awareness of sarcomas, a rare form of cancer that most often affects soft tissues.

She died of a sub-type of sarcoma called clear-cell sarcoma on January 18, 2010, at age 63, at her home in Montreal. Her sister Anna wrote on their website:
:&quot;Sadly our sweet Kate had to leave us last night. She departed in a haze of song and love surrounded by family and good friends. She is irreplaceable and we are broken-hearted. Til we meet again dear sister.&quot;

She made her last public appearance, with Rufus and Martha Wainwright, at the Royal Albert Hall in London, just six weeks before her death. The show raised $55,000 for the Kate McGarrigle Fund.

On June 12, 2010, the Meltdown Festival staged a tribute concert in her honour, organised by Richard Thompson. The concert included performances by her daughter Martha Wainwright, son Rufus Wainwright, sister Anna McGarrigle, ex-husband Loudon Wainwright III, Neil Tennant, Nick Cave, Emmylou Harris, Richard and Linda Thompson, and longtime friends and musical collaborators Chaim Tannenbaum and Joel Zifkin. Her close friend Emmylou Harris wrote the song &quot;Darlin&#x27; Kate&quot; in her memory, which appears on her album &quot;Hard Bargain&quot;.

A &quot;Celebration of Kate McGarrigle&quot; was held on May 12 and 13, 2011, at New York City&#x27;s Town Hall. Among the participating artists honoring her at these concerts were Martha Wainwright, Rufus Wainwright, Anna McGarrigle, Emmylou Harris, Lisa Hannigan, Norah Jones, Antony Hegarty, Jimmy Fallon, Krystle Warren, Justin Vivian Bond, Teddy Thompson, Jenni Muldaur, writer Michael Ondaatje and longtime friends and McGarrigle sidemen Chaim Tannenbaum and Joel Zifkin. The celebration was curated by Joe Boyd and filmed by Lian Lunson. &quot;Sing Me the Songs That Say I Love You: A Concert for Kate McGarrigle&quot; was released in June 2013; &quot;Sing Me the Songs: Celebrating the Works of Kate McGarrigle&quot; served as the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

<text>Anna McGarrigle, CM (born December 4, 1944) is a Canadian folk music singer and songwriter who recorded and performed with her late sister Kate McGarrigle.

==Early life==
Anna McGarrigle studied at the École des beaux-arts de Montréal (1964-1968).

==Music career==
In the 1960s, Montreal natives Kate and Anna McGarrigle established themselves in Montreal&#x27;s burgeoning folk scene while they attended school. From 1963 to 1967, they teamed up with Jack Nissenson and Peter Weldon to form the folk group Mountain City Four. The sisters wrote, recorded and performed music into the twenty-first century with assorted accompanying musicians, including Chaim Tannenbaum and Joel Zifkin.

McGarrigle was also a songwriter; her song &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot; was the title track of Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s 1974 album, and her song &quot;Cool River&quot; was recorded by Maria Muldaur.

In 2016 Anna and her older sister Jane (1941-2025) wrote a book together, &quot;Mountain City Girls&quot;.

==Personal life==
McGarrigle married journalist Dane Lanken on August 25, 1977, in Hawkesbury, Ontario. She and Lanken have two children, Sylvan (b. 1977) and Lily (b. 1979).

==Awards==
Kate and Anna&#x27;s 1976 debut album &quot;Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle&quot; was chosen by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as Best Record of the Year. In 1993 she was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

The duo&#x27;s albums &quot;Matapedia&quot; (1996) and &quot;The McGarrigle Hour&quot; (1998) won Juno Awards. In 1999 Kate and Anna received Women of Originality awards and in 2006 SOCAN Lifetime Achievement awards.

In 2017 she was presented with a Quebec Arts and Letters Award.

<doc id="942048" wikidata="Q483921" url="?curid=942048" title="Adaptation">
<text>In biology, adaptation has three related meanings. Firstly, it is the dynamic evolutionary process of natural selection that fits organisms to their environment, enhancing their evolutionary fitness. Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process. Thirdly, it is a phenotypic trait or adaptive trait, with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has evolved through natural selection. 

Historically, adaptation has been described from the time of the ancient Greek philosophers such as Empedocles and Aristotle. In 18th and 19th-century natural theology, adaptation was taken as evidence for the existence of a deity. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace proposed instead that it was explained by natural selection.

Adaptation is related to biological fitness, which governs the rate of evolution as measured by changes in allele frequencies. Often, two or more species co-adapt and co-evolve as they develop adaptations that interlock with those of the other species, such as with flowering plants and pollinating insects. In mimicry, species evolve to resemble other species; in mimicry this is a mutually beneficial co-evolution as each of a group of strongly defended species (such as wasps able to sting) come to advertise their defences in the same way. Features evolved for one purpose may be co-opted for a different one, as when the insulating feathers of dinosaurs were co-opted for bird flight.

Adaptation is a major topic in the philosophy of biology, as it concerns function and purpose (teleology). Some biologists try to avoid terms which imply purpose in adaptation, not least because they suggest a deity&#x27;s intentions, but others note that adaptation is necessarily purposeful.

==History ==
Adaptation is an observable fact of life accepted by philosophers and natural historians from ancient times, independently of their views on evolution, but their explanations differed. Empedocles did not believe that adaptation required a final cause (a purpose), but thought that it &quot;came about naturally, since such things survived.&quot; Aristotle did believe in final causes, but assumed that species were fixed.

In natural theology, adaptation was interpreted as the work of a deity and as evidence for the existence of God. William Paley believed that organisms were perfectly adapted to the lives they led, an argument that shadowed Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who had argued that God had brought about &quot;the best of all possible worlds.&quot; Voltaire&#x27;s satire Dr. Pangloss is a parody of this optimistic idea, and David Hume also argued against design. Charles Darwin broke with the tradition by emphasising the flaws and limitations which occurred in the animal and plant worlds.

Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed a tendency for organisms to become more complex, moving up a ladder of progress, plus &quot;the influence of circumstances&quot;, usually expressed as &quot;use and disuse&quot;. This second, subsidiary element of his theory is what is now called Lamarckism, a proto-evolutionary hypothesis of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, intended to explain adaptations by natural means.

Other natural historians, such as Buffon, accepted adaptation, and some also accepted evolution, without voicing their opinions as to the mechanism. This illustrates the real merit of Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, and secondary figures such as Henry Walter Bates, for putting forward a mechanism whose significance had only been glimpsed previously. A century later, experimental field studies and breeding experiments by people such as E. B. Ford and Theodosius Dobzhansky produced evidence that natural selection was not only the &#x27;engine&#x27; behind adaptation, but was a much stronger force than had previously been thought.

==General principles ==

===What adaptation is===

Adaptation is primarily a process rather than a physical form or part of a body. An internal parasite (such as a liver fluke) can illustrate the distinction: such a parasite may have a very simple bodily structure, but nevertheless the organism is highly adapted to its specific environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex. However, as a practical term, &quot;adaptation&quot; often refers to a &quot;product&quot;: those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function remains in doubt. By using the term &quot;adaptation&quot; for the evolutionary &quot;process&quot;, and &quot;adaptive trait&quot; for the bodily part or function (the product), one may distinguish the two different senses of the word.

Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the observed diversity of species, such as the different species of Darwin&#x27;s finches. The other process is speciation, in which new species arise, typically through reproductive isolation. An example widely used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes, where the question of reproductive isolation is complex.

Adaptation is not always a simple matter where the ideal phenotype evolves for a given environment. An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places &quot;constraints&quot; on the evolution of development, behaviour, and structure of organisms. The main constraint, over which there has been much debate, is the requirement that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. However, it is not clear what &quot;relatively small&quot; should mean, for example polyploidy in plants is a reasonably common large genetic change. The origin of eukaryotic endosymbiosis is a more dramatic example.

All adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches. The adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism, such as shape, body covering, armament, and internal organization. Behavioural adaptations are inherited systems of behaviour, whether inherited in detail as instincts, or as a neuropsychological capacity for learning. Examples include searching for food, mating, and vocalizations. Physiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions such as making venom, secreting slime, and phototropism, but also involve more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation affects all aspects of the life of an organism.

The following definitions are given by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky:
:1. &quot;Adaptation&quot; is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats.
:2. &quot;Adaptedness&quot; is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.
:3. An &quot;adaptive trait&quot; is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.

===What adaptation is not===
Adaptation differs from flexibility, acclimatization, and learning, all of which are changes during life which are not inherited. Flexibility deals with the relative capacity of an organism to maintain itself in different habitats: its degree of specialization. Acclimatization describes automatic physiological adjustments during life; learning means alteration in behavioural performance during life.

Flexibility stems from phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism with a given genotype (genetic type) to change its phenotype (observable characteristics) in response to changes in its habitat, or to move to a different habitat. The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme examples are koalas which depend on &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, and giant pandas which require bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many carnivores. The &quot;tendency&quot; to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited—it is an adaptation. Rather different is developmental flexibility: &quot;An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised in or transferred to new conditions, it changes in structure so that it is better fitted to survive in the new environment,&quot; writes the evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith.

If humans move to a higher altitude, respiration and physical exertion become a problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing more red blood cells. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the acclimatization itself is not. The reproductive rate declines, but deaths from some tropical diseases also go down. Over a longer period of time, some people are better able to reproduce at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals have had time to acclimatize.

===Adaptedness and fitness ===
There is a relationship between adaptedness and the concept of fitness used in population genetics. Differences in fitness between genotypes predict the rate of evolution by natural selection. Natural selection changes the relative frequencies of alternative phenotypes, insofar as they are heritable. However, a phenotype with high adaptedness may not have high fitness. Dobzhansky mentioned the example of the Californian redwood, which is highly adapted, but a relict species in danger of extinction. Elliott Sober commented that adaptation was a retrospective concept since it implied something about the history of a trait, whereas fitness predicts a trait&#x27;s future.

:1. Relative fitness. The average contribution to the next generation by a genotype or a class of genotypes, relative to the contributions of other genotypes in the population. This is also known as &quot;Darwinian fitness&quot;, &quot;selection coefficient&quot;, and other terms.
:2. Absolute fitness. The absolute contribution to the next generation by a genotype or a class of genotypes. Also known as the Malthusian parameter when applied to the population as a whole.
:3. Adaptedness. The extent to which a phenotype fits its local ecological niche. Researchers can sometimes test this through a reciprocal transplant.

Sewall Wright proposed that populations occupy &quot;adaptive peaks&quot; on a fitness landscape. To evolve to another, higher peak, a population would first have to pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages, and might be &quot;trapped&quot; on a peak that is not optimally adapted.

==Types==

===Changes in habitat ===

Before Darwin, adaptation was seen as a fixed relationship between an organism and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the climate changed, so did the habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the biota. Also, habitats are subject to changes in their biota: for example, invasions of species from other areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are always changing. Change is the rule, though much depends on the speed and degree of the change.
When the habitat changes, three main things may happen to a resident population: habitat tracking, genetic change or extinction. In fact, all three things may occur in sequence. Of these three effects only genetic change brings about adaptation.
When a habitat changes, the resident population typically moves to more suitable places; this is the typical response of flying insects or oceanic organisms, which have wide (though not unlimited) opportunity for movement. This common response is called &quot;habitat tracking&quot;. It is one explanation put forward for the periods of apparent stasis in the fossil record (the punctuated equilibrium theory).

=== Genetic change ===

Without mutation, the ultimate source of all genetic variation, there would be no genetic changes and no subsequent adaptation through evolution by natural selection. Genetic change occurs in a population when mutation increases or decreases in its initial frequency followed by random genetic drift, migration, recombination or natural selection act on this genetic variation. One example is that the first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism at the very origin of life on Earth may have been co-opted components of the already-existing purine nucleotide metabolism, a metabolic pathway that evolved in an ancient RNA world. The co-option requires new mutations and through natural selection, the population then adapts genetically to its present circumstances. Genetic changes may result in entirely new or gradual change to visible structures, or they may adjust physiological activity in a way that suits the habitat. The varying shapes of the beaks of Darwin&#x27;s finches, for example, are driven by adaptive mutations in the ALX1 gene. The coat color of different wild mouse species matches their environments, whether black lava or light sand, owing to adaptive mutations in the melanocortin 1 receptor and other melanin pathway genes. Physiological resistance to the heart poisons (cardiac glycosides) that monarch butterflies store in their bodies to protect themselves from predators are driven by adaptive mutations in the target of the poison, the sodium pump, resulting in target site insensitivity. These same adaptive mutations and similar changes at the same amino acid sites were found to evolve in a parallel manner in distantly related insects that feed on the same plants, and even in a bird that feeds on monarchs through convergent evolution, a hallmark of adaptation. Convergence at the gene-level across distantly related species can arise because of evolutionary constraint.

Habitats and biota do frequently change over time and space. Therefore, it follows that the process of adaptation is never fully complete. Over time, it may happen that the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better, resulting in stabilizing selection. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur suddenly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. The only way for it to climb back up that fitness peak is via the introduction of new genetic variation for natural selection to act upon. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic &quot;tracking process&quot;, which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back from the brink of extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. Adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem.

Leigh Van Valen thought that even in a stable environment, because of antagonistic species interactions and limited resources, a species must constantly had to adapt to maintain its relative standing. This became known as the Red Queen hypothesis, as seen in host-parasite interactions.

Existing genetic variation and mutation were the traditional sources of material on which natural selection could act. In addition, horizontal gene transfer is possible between organisms in different species, using mechanisms as varied as gene cassettes, plasmids, transposons and viruses such as bacteriophages.

=== Co-adaptation ===


In coevolution, where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of another species, new or &#x27;improved&#x27; adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding features in the other species. In other words, each species triggers reciprocal natural selection in the other. These co-adaptational relationships are intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a trajectory for millions of years, as has occurred in the relationship between flowering plants and pollinating insects.

=== Mimicry ===

Bates&#x27; work on Amazonian butterflies led him to develop the first scientific account of mimicry, especially the kind of mimicry which bears his name: Batesian mimicry. This is the mimicry by a palatable species of an unpalatable or noxious species (the model), gaining a selective advantage as predators avoid the model and therefore also the mimic. Mimicry is thus an anti-predator adaptation. A common example seen in temperate gardens is the hoverfly (Syrphidae), many of which—though bearing no sting—mimic the warning coloration of aculeate Hymenoptera (wasps and bees). Such mimicry does not need to be perfect to improve the survival of the palatable species.

Bates, Wallace and Fritz Müller believed that Batesian and Müllerian mimicry provided evidence for the action of natural selection, a view which is now standard amongst biologists.

=== Trade-offs ===

All adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but they cannot scratch their backs; mammals&#x27; hair helps temperature, but offers a niche for ectoparasites; the only flying penguins do is under water. Adaptations serving different functions may be mutually destructive. Compromise and makeshift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise.

==== Examples ====
Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resources. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.

Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range.

The peacock&#x27;s ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources. Darwin&#x27;s explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection: &quot;This depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in exclusive relation to reproduction.&quot; The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called &#x27;mate choice,&#x27; with an implication that the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value. The recognition of sexual selection was for a long time in abeyance, but has been rehabilitated.

The conflict between the size of the human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400 cm3, else it will not get through the mother&#x27;s pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400 cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.

As another example, the long neck of a giraffe brings benefits but at a cost. The neck of a giraffe can be up to in length. The benefits are that it can be used for inter-species competition or for foraging on tall trees where shorter herbivores cannot reach. The cost is that a long neck is heavy and adds to the animal&#x27;s body mass, requiring additional energy to build the neck and to carry its weight around.

==Shifts in function ==
===Pre-adaptation===

Pre-adaptation occurs when a population has characteristics which by chance are suited for a set of conditions not previously experienced. For example, the polyploid cordgrass &quot;Spartina townsendii&quot; is better adapted than either of its parent species to their own habitat of saline marsh and mud-flats. Among domestic animals, the White Leghorn chicken is markedly more resistant to vitamin B1 deficiency than other breeds; on a plentiful diet this makes no difference, but on a restricted diet this preadaptation could be decisive.

Pre-adaptation may arise because a natural population carries a huge quantity of genetic variability. In diploid eukaryotes, this is a consequence of the system of sexual reproduction, where mutant alleles get partially shielded, for example, by genetic dominance. Microorganisms, with their huge populations, also carry a great deal of genetic variability. The first experimental evidence of the pre-adaptive nature of genetic variants in microorganisms was provided by Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück who developed the Fluctuation Test, a method to show the random fluctuation of pre-existing genetic changes that conferred resistance to bacteriophages in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. The word is controversial because it is teleological and the entire concept of natural selection depends on the presence of genetic variation, regardless of the population size of a species in question.

===Co-option of existing traits: exaptation ===

Features that now appear as adaptations sometimes arose by co-option of existing traits, evolved for some other purpose. The classic example is the ear ossicles of mammals, which we know from paleontological and embryological evidence originated in the upper and lower jaws and the hyoid bone of their synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the gill arches of early fish. The word &quot;exaptation&quot; was coined to cover these common evolutionary shifts in function. The flight feathers of birds evolved from the much earlier feathers of dinosaurs, which might have been used for insulation or for display.

== Niche construction ==

Animals including earthworms, beavers and humans use some of their adaptations to modify their surroundings, so as to maximize their chances of surviving and reproducing. Beavers create dams and lodges, changing the ecosystems of the valleys around them. Earthworms, as Darwin noted, improve the topsoil in which they live by incorporating organic matter. Humans have constructed extensive civilizations with cities in environments as varied as the Arctic and hot deserts.
In all three cases, the construction and maintenance of ecological niches helps drive the continued selection of the genes of these animals, in an environment that the animals have modified.

==Non-adaptive traits ==
Some traits do not appear to be adaptive as they have a neutral or deleterious effect on fitness in the current environment. Because genes often have pleiotropic effects, not all traits may be functional: they may be what Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin called spandrels, features brought about by neighbouring adaptations, on the analogy with the often highly decorated triangular areas between pairs of arches in architecture, which began as functionless features.

Another possibility is that a trait may have been adaptive at some point in an organism&#x27;s evolutionary history, but a change in habitats caused what used to be an adaptation to become unnecessary or even maladapted. Such adaptations are termed vestigial. Many organisms have vestigial organs, which are the remnants of fully functional structures in their ancestors. As a result of changes in lifestyle the organs became redundant, and are either not functional or reduced in functionality. Since any structure represents some kind of cost to the general economy of the body, an advantage may accrue from their elimination once they are not functional. Examples: wisdom teeth in humans; the loss of pigment and functional eyes in cave fauna; the loss of structure in endoparasites.

==Extinction and coextinction ==
If a population cannot move or change sufficiently to preserve its long-term viability, then it will become extinct, at least in that locale. The species may or may not survive in other locales. Species extinction occurs when the death rate over the entire species exceeds the birth rate for a long enough period for the species to disappear. It was an observation of Van Valen that groups of species tend to have a characteristic and fairly regular rate of extinction.

Just as there is co-adaptation, there is also coextinction, the loss of a species due to the extinction of another with which it is coadapted, as with the extinction of a parasitic insect following the loss of its host, or when a flowering plant loses its pollinator, or when a food chain is disrupted.

==Origin of adaptive capacities==

The first stage in the evolution of life on earth is often hypothesized to be the RNA world in which short self-replicating RNA molecules proliferated before the evolution of DNA and proteins. By this hypothesis, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: heritability, variation of type, and competition for resources. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely have been a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities may have been: (1) replication with moderate fidelity, giving rise to heritability while allowing variation of type, (2) resistance to decay, and (3) acquisition of resources. These adaptive capacities would have been determined by the folded configurations of the RNA replicators resulting from their nucleotide sequences.

==Philosophical issues==


Adaptation raises philosophical issues concerning how biologists speak of function and purpose, as this carries implications of evolutionary history – that a feature evolved by natural selection for a specific reason – and potentially of supernatural intervention – that features and organisms exist because of a deity&#x27;s conscious intentions. In his biology, Aristotle introduced teleology to describe the adaptedness of organisms, but without accepting the supernatural intention built into Plato&#x27;s thinking, which Aristotle rejected. Modern biologists continue to face the same difficulty. On the one hand, adaptation is purposeful: natural selection chooses what works and eliminates what does not. On the other hand, biologists by and large reject conscious purpose in evolution. The dilemma gave rise to a famous joke by the evolutionary biologist Haldane: &quot;Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he&#x27;s unwilling to be seen with her in public.&#x27;&quot; David Hull commented that Haldane&#x27;s mistress &quot;has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt it.&quot; Ernst Mayr stated that &quot;adaptedness... is an a posteriori result rather than an a priori goal-seeking&quot;, meaning that the question of whether something is an adaptation can only be determined after the event.

==History==
The Yilan Plain in which the city is located has historically been referred to as Kapalan (), Kapsulan (; also 甲子蘭), Komalan (), etc. These names, as well as that of Yilan itself, were given to the sites by the Kavalan tribe of Taiwanese aborigines.

===Qing dynasty===
In 1810 under Qing dynasty rule, a formal administration office was established at Wuwei (五圍) and &quot;Komalan Subprefecture&quot; () was at the present day location of Yilan City. Construction of the city wall was completed a year later. After a few years once the basic infrastructure was ready, the city assumed the political, economical, cultural and educational center for the Lanyang Plain. In 1878, Komalan was a large rice production area commonly called &quot;Kapsulan&quot;, and became a district called &quot;Gilan Hsien&quot;. It was one of the three new districts that constituted the new Taipeh Prefecture.

The duo wrote, produced, and played instruments on the tracks, while Heap also provided lead vocals. In 2004, they recorded a cover of &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot; by Bonnie Tyler, which was used in the credits of the 2004 film &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. Frou Frou amicably disbanded later that year.

In 2017, Heap and Sigsworth reunited as Frou Frou for Heap&#x27;s &quot;Mycelia&quot; Tour. They released an EP of unreleased Frou Frou demos for &quot;Details&quot;&#x27; 20th anniversary in 2022.

== History ==

=== 1997–2002: Introductions ===
Heap and Sigsworth met in 1996 when Heap was 17 years old after Sigsworth was given a demo recorded by Heap and asked to meet with her. The two first collaborated when Heap contributed guest vocals to Sigsworth&#x27;s band Acacia. Sigsworth later wrote two songs for Heap&#x27;s 1998 debut studio album, &quot;I Megaphone&quot;, including her debut single, &quot;Getting Scared&quot;. As Heap went on tour throughout North America and Europe to promote the album, Sigsworth continued to write and produce for other artists, including Madonna and Björk. As Heap&#x27;s record label Almo Sounds lost funding, they asked Heap for a second album, and dropped her soon after being acquired by Universal, while Acacia was disbanded.

Sigsworth began work on an album in 2001, which he initially envisioned as a solo album consisting of songs written and produced by Sigsworth with features from various singers, poets, and rappers. After working with Heap on a song, Sigsworth instead decided to form Frou Frou with her, and the two began working on an album together.

=== 2002–2003: &quot;Details&quot; ===
In 2002, Frou Frou signed a record deal with Universal Records on the Island Records imprint in the UK and Europe, and MCA Records in the USA. They released their first and only album, &quot;Details&quot; in June 2002. An album of electronic music with elements of trip hop, pop and rock, the eclectic, intricately produced tracks use a wide range of traditional instruments including cellos, autoharps, guitars, keyboards, and Indian drums, with layered vocals from Heap.

The album received critical acclaim, but this did not translate into mass sales the duo had hoped for. &quot;Breathe In&quot; was released as the first single internationally. It reached number two on the Italian radio airplay charts, and debuted in the Top 50 in the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up singles &quot;Must Be Dreaming&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Good To Be in Love&quot; were shelved from commercial release in the UK, however, through lack of radio and TV interest. &quot;Breathe In&quot; and &quot;Must Be Dreaming&quot; did become minor hits in Asia, particularly in Indonesia, where both singles made Top 10, peaking at number 7 and 5 respectively on the Indonesian Airplay Chart. 

A video was made for a fourth single from the album, the closer &quot;The Dumbing Down of Love&quot;, directed by Joel Peissig (who later directed Heap&#x27;s solo video &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;). After touring the record extensively across the United States, where the duo had established a cult fan base, Frou Frou amicably disbanded in 2004.

Sigsworth was contacted in 2004 by music supervisor Chris Douridas, an early fan of Frou Frou, who asked him to record a cover version of Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot; for the &quot;Shrek 2&quot; soundtrack. Although Frou Frou was no longer active, Sigsworth reached out to Heap to record vocals for the cover, and the duo was briefly reformed. Frou Frou also gained popularity in the United States in 2004 after Zach Braff used &quot;Let Go&quot; on the soundtrack for his film, &quot;Garden State&quot;.

The duo also worked together in 2003 on a track for Britney Spears&#x27;s fourth album &quot;In The Zone&quot;, entitled &quot;Over To You Now&quot;. The track was written by Sigsworth, Swedish pop star Robyn and her long-term songwriting companion, and Sigsworth asked Heap to come in and make the song more suitable for Spears, adding backing vocals and making the track more electronic music-infused. Despite not being used on &quot;In The Zone&quot;, the track was released in late 2005 on the Japan CD single of Spears&#x27; single, &quot;Someday (I Will Understand)&quot; and on the UK and Japan bonus CDs of the DVD release of her reality TV show, &quot;Britney and Kevin: Chaotic&quot;.

=== 2017present: Live reunion, &quot;Off Cuts&quot; ===

In November 2017, it was announced that Heap and Sigsworth would be reuniting as Frou Frou during Imogen Heap&#x27;s Mycelia Tour throughout 2018 and 2019. In April 2019, Frou Frou released a live recording of &quot;Guitar Song&quot;, their first single in 15 years and one of two singles not released at the time of the band&#x27;s initial break-up, through We Are Hear.

In late March 2022, Imogen Heap partnered with Symphonic Distribution to re-release previous material, including a handful of Frou Frou demos, which have been compiled into the &quot;Off Cuts&quot; EP, released on 3 June 2022, just shy of &quot;Details&quot;&#x27; 20th anniversary. The first single &quot;A New Kind of Love (Demo)&quot; was released 8 April. A studio version of the &quot;Guitar Song&quot; demo released as the second single on 6 May.

On February 25, 2025, Imogen Heap re-released the song &quot;Aeroplane&quot; as a single on Spotify, with two versions from previously recorded material.

== Genre ==
Frou Frou&#x27;s music has been described as electronic, electropop, synth-pop, and alternative pop.

<text>Gnetum is a genus of gymnosperms, the sole genus in the family Gnetaceae within the Gnetophyta. They are tropical evergreen trees, shrubs and lianas. Unlike other gymnosperms, they possess vessel elements in the xylem. Some species have been proposed to have been the first plants to be insect-pollinated as their fossils occur in association with extinct pollinating scorpionflies. Molecular phylogenies based on nuclear and plastid sequences from most of the species indicate hybridization among some of the Southeast Asian species. Fossil-calibrated molecular-clocks suggest that the &quot;Gnetum&quot; lineages now found in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia are the result of ancient long-distance dispersal across seawater.

Their leaves are rich in phytochemicals such as flavonoids and stilbenes. Of the species studied so far, &quot;Gnetum&quot; have photosynthetic and transpiration capacities which are considerably lower than those of other seed plants, due to the absence of multiple chloroplast genes essential for photosynthesis, a trait they seem to share with the other living members of Gnetophyta, &quot;Ephedra&quot; and &quot;Welwitschia&quot;, as well as conifers. There are over 50 different species of &quot;Gnetum&quot;.

==Species==

==Uses==
Many &quot;Gnetum&quot; species are edible, with the seeds being roasted, and the foliage used as a leaf vegetable. The plant is harvested and yields a useful fiber. There is no sense of danger in consuming the fruit or the seeds.

There is also a study done on the plant to see if it has any medicinal properties, finding some anti-coagulation effects due to its stilbenoid content. The family Gnetaceae is well known as a rich source of plant-derived stilbenoids as well as Cyperaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, and Vitaceae.

== Conservation ==
Some species of &quot;Gnetum&quot; are in danger of dying out. The habitats are being removed with the trees being cut down to create industry. The tropical rainforest are being destroyed so many of the species are going extinct such as &quot;Gnetum oxycarpum&quot;. The rainforests are being torn down and being turned into farmland. &quot;Gnetum&quot; live in only a small part of the rainforest.

<text>Birka Cruises (formerly Birka Line) was an Ålandian shipping company that operated a cruise ship on the Baltic Sea with Stockholm as the starting point under the name Birka Cruises. Birka Line has a cargo-shipping subsidiary, Birka Cargo. During the 1970s the company was often marketed as Ålandslinjen. Since May 2007 Birka Line has been a daughter company of Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö.

In July 2020 Eckerö Line announced that it was shutting down its Birka Cruises subsidiary after 49 years of operation.

==History==
Birka Line was founded in 1971, they bought MS &quot;Prinsessen&quot; from DFDS and renamed her MS &quot;Prinsessan&quot;. On November 21, she made her first voyage between Stockholm and Mariehamn. In 1972, &quot;Prinsessan&quot;″s sister ship MS &quot;Olav&quot; was bought and renamed MS &quot;Baronessan&quot;. In 1973 Birka started traffic on the routes Stockholm–Helsinki with MS &quot;Freeport&quot; and Stockholm–Helsinki–Leningrad with MS &quot;Drottningen&quot;. However, due to rising fuel costs and the high fuel consumption of the &quot;Freeport&quot;, both lines were terminated in late 1973. The &quot;Freeport&quot; was sold to Rederi AB Svea and the &quot;Drottningen&quot; returned to her owners SJ. The company continued operating with the &quot;Prinsessan&quot; and &quot;Baronessan&quot; until 1978. The first &quot;Prinsessan&quot; was renamed &quot;Prinsen&quot; to free the name for a newer ship, MS &quot;Finnhansa&quot; that was purchased from Finnlines in January 1978 and renamed MS &quot;Prinsessan&quot;. In 1980 the &quot;Baronessan&quot; was sold to Panamian interests.

On 22 April 1986 Birka&#x27;s first newbuilding MS &quot;Birka Princess&quot; was delivered from the Valmet Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki. With the delivery of the new ship, the company became marketed as &quot;Birka Cruises&quot;, as an attempt to show its focus on cruises. The following year the &quot;Prinsessan&quot; was sold to Louis Cruise Lines, becoming their &quot;Princesa Marissa&quot;. In 1990 Birka Line purchased the majority of United Shipping.

In the late 1980s the company placed an order for a second cruise ship, to operate alongside the &quot;Birka Princess&quot;, from Wärtsilä Turku shipyard. The ship was to be named MS &quot;Birka Queen&quot;, but during construction the shipyard went bankrupt, radically raising the cost of the ship. Birka did not accept delivery of the ship with such a high price, and the ship was instead completed for Majesty Cruise Line as &quot;Royal Majesty&quot;. In place of the &quot;Birka Queen&quot; Birka Line purchased MS &quot;Sunward&quot; from Norwegian Cruise Line in May 1992, and renamed her MS &quot;Birka Queen&quot; for cruising from Stockholm to Riga and St. Petersburg. In October the same year, the ship was chartered back to NCL. Although she remained under Birka Line ownership until 1997, the second &quot;Birka Queen&quot; never sailed for Birka Line again.

In 1999 the &quot;Birka Princess&quot; was rebuilt with additional cabins and more streamlined superstructure. In January 2002 Birka Line purchased the entirety of United Shipping which was renamed Birka Cargo. In November of the same year the company placed an order for a new cruise ship with Aker Finnyards, Rauma. The ship was completed as MS &quot;Birka Paradise&quot; in 2004. The ship was delivered in a time when there was a very strong competition for cruise and ferry passengers on the northern Baltic Sea. Due to lack of passengers and because of financial problems, the &quot;Birka Princess&quot; was sold to Louis Cruise Lines in early 2006. On 8 March 2007 it was reported that the fellow Ålandian shipping company Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö was looking to purchase Birka Line in its entirety (Eckerö already owned 42% of Birka Line). On 24 May 2007 it was reported that a public offer made by Eckerö had increased their ownership in Birka Line to 57.9%. On 28 May Birka Line officially became a daughter company of Eckerö Line.

<doc id="942152" wikidata="Q2743121" url="?curid=942152" title="Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle">
<text>[[Kate McGarrigle]] (February 6, 1946 – January 18, 2010) and [[Anna McGarrigle]] (born December 4, 1944) were a duo of folk rock and country folk Canadian singer-songwriters (and sisters) from Quebec, who performed together until Kate&#x27;s death in 2010.

==Music career==
In the 1960s, in Montreal, while Kate was studying chemical engineering at McGill University and Anna art at the École des beaux-arts de Montréal, they began performing in public and writing their own songs. From 1963 to 1967 they teamed up with Jack Nissenson and Peter Weldon to form the folk group Mountain City Four.

Their songs have been covered by a variety of artists including Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris, Judy Collins, and others. These covers led to the McGarrigles getting their first recording contract in 1974. They released their eponymous debut album in 1976, and created nine more albums through 2008.

Although associated with Quebec&#x27;s anglophone community, they also recorded and performed many songs in French. Two of their albums, &quot;Entre la jeunesse et la sagesse&quot; and &quot;La vache qui pleure&quot;, are entirely in French.

Their version of Wade Hemsworth&#x27;s song, &quot;The Log Driver&#x27;s Waltz&quot; grew famous as the soundtrack for a 1979 animated film directed by John Weldon at Canada&#x27;s National Film Board. They provided backing vocals on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;No More Shall We Part&quot;.

They continued to write, record and perform music into the 21st century, with assorted accompanying artists including Gerry Conway, Pat Donaldson, Ken Pearson, Michel Pépin, Chaim Tannenbaum and Joel Zifkin.

==Personal lives==
Anna and Kate McGarrigle were born in Montreal of mixed Irish- and French-Canadian background. They grew up in Saint-Sauveur, where they learned piano from nuns. In 1971 Kate married the singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III. Their children, Rufus and Martha, are also both singers. The two divorced in 1976. Kate McGarrigle died in 2010, aged 63, of sarcoma, a rare form of cancer.

Anna McGarrigle was married to Canadian journalist and author Dane Lanken until his death on March 3, 2023. The couple had two children, Lily Lanken and Sylvan Lanken, and lived in North Glengarry, Ontario, just west of the Quebec border. Dane appeared as a vocalist on several of the sisters&#x27; albums and in 2007 wrote their career biography. Another sister, Jane McGarrigle (1941–2025), was a film and television composer who acted as business manager for Kate and Anna, and also wrote and performed several songs with the duo.

==Honours and awards==
They were appointed Members of the Order of Canada in 1993 and received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award in 2004. On November 22, 2006, they received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2006 SOCAN Awards in Toronto.

They received the 2010 Mojo Roots Award, which was presented by Emmylou Harris. The award was accepted by Anna together with Kate&#x27;s children Rufus and Martha Wainwright, as Kate had died early that year on January 18.

<doc id="942255" wikidata="Q7068153" url="?curid=942255" title="Nuclear navy">
<text>A nuclear navy, or nuclear-powered navy, refers to the portion of a navy consisting of naval ships powered by nuclear marine propulsion. The concept was revolutionary for naval warfare when first proposed. Prior to nuclear power, submarines were powered by diesel engines and could only submerge through the use of batteries. In order for these submarines to run their diesel engines and charge their batteries they would have to surface or snorkel. The use of nuclear power allowed these submarines to become true submersibles and unlike their conventional counterparts, they became limited only by crew endurance and supplies.

==Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers==
Currently, only the United States and France possess nuclear-powered aircraft-carriers.

The United States Navy has by far the most nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, with ten carriers and one carrier in service. The last conventionally-powered aircraft carrier left the U.S. fleet as of 12 May 2009, when the USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was deactivated. France&#x27;s latest aircraft carrier, the , is nuclear-powered. The United Kingdom rejected nuclear power early in the development of its s on cost grounds, as even several decades of fuel use costs less than a nuclear reactor. Since 1949 the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been one of the lead laboratories in the development of the nuclear navy. The planned indigenous Chinese carriers also feature nuclear propulsion.

==Nuclear-powered submarines==

The United States Navy operates the largest fleet of nuclear submarines. Only the United States Navy, the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, and France&#x27;s &quot;Marine Nationale&quot; field an all-nuclear submarine force. By 1989, there were over 400 nuclear-powered submarines operational or being built. Some 250 of these submarines have now been scrapped and some on order cancelled, due to weapons reduction programs. Russia and the United States had over one hundred each, with the United Kingdom and France fewer than twenty each and China six. The Indian Navy launched their first indigenous nuclear-powered submarines on 26 July 2009. India is also operating one nuclear attack submarine with talks of leasing one more nuclear submarine from Russia. India plans to build six nuclear attack submarines and follow on to the Arihant class of ballistic missile submarines.

==Nuclear-powered cruisers==

The US had several nuclear cruisers. The cruisers were the USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot;, USS &quot;California&quot;, USS &quot;Long Beach&quot;, USS &quot;Truxtun&quot;, USS &quot;South Carolina&quot;, USS &quot;Virginia&quot;, USS &quot;Texas&quot;, USS &quot;Mississippi&quot;, and USS &quot;Arkansas&quot;. The &quot;Long Beach&quot; was deemed too expensive and was decommissioned in 1995 instead of receiving its third nuclear refueling and proposed upgrade. It was sold for scrap in 2012 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Currently the United States does not have any nuclear cruisers.

Russia has four s, though only one is active, the other three being laid up. The command ship &quot;SSV-33 Ural&quot;, based on the &quot;Kirov&quot; class, is also laid up. Seven civilian nuclear icebreakers remain in service: four of six s, the two &quot;Taymyr&quot;-class icebreakers &quot;Taymyr&quot; and &quot;Vaygach&quot;, and the LASH carrier and container ship .

== United States Navy ==
By 2003 the U.S. Navy had accumulated over 5,400 &quot;reactor years&quot; of accident-free experience, and operated more than 80 nuclear-powered ships.

=== Admiral Hyman G. Rickover ===
Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, (1900–1986), of the United States Navy, known as &quot;father of the nuclear navy&quot;
was an electrical engineer by training, and was the primary architect who implemented this daring concept, and believed that it was the natural next phase for the way military vessels could be propelled and powered. The challenge was to reduce the size of a nuclear reactor to fit on board a ship or submarine, as well as to encase it sufficiently so that radiation hazards would not be a safety concern.

Soon after World War II, Rickover was assigned to the Bureau of Ships in September 1947 and received training in nuclear power at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In February 1949 he received an assignment to the Division of Reactor Development, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and then assumed control of the United States Navy&#x27;s effort as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch in the Bureau of Ships. This dual role allowed him to lead the efforts to develop the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, , which was launched in 1954. As Vice Admiral, from 1958, for three decades Rickover exercised tight control over the ships, technology, and personnel of the nuclear navy, even interviewing every prospective officer for new nuclear-powered navy vessels.

=== Philip Abelson ===
Leading nuclear physicist Philip Abelson (1913–2004) turned his attention under the guidance of Ross Gunn to applying nuclear power to naval propulsion. Their early efforts at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) provided an early glimpse at what was to become the nuclear Navy.

=== United States Naval reactors ===
At the present time, many important vessels in the United States Navy are powered by nuclear reactors. All submarines and aircraft carriers are nuclear-powered. Several cruisers were nuclear-powered but these have all been retired.

United States naval reactors are given three-character designations consisting of a letter representing the ship type the reactor is designed for, a consecutive generation number, and a letter indicating the reactor&#x27;s designer. The ship types are &quot;A&quot; for aircraft carrier, &quot;C&quot; for cruiser, &quot;D&quot; for destroyer, and &quot;S&quot; for submarine. The designers are &quot;W&quot; for Westinghouse, &quot;G&quot; for General Electric, &quot;C&quot; for Combustion Engineering, and &quot;B&quot; for Bechtel. Examples are S5W, D1G, A4W, and D2W.

Information concerning United States naval reactors may or may not be classified (see Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information).

==Accidents involving naval nuclear-powered vessels==
===United States===

* (1963; &quot;Thresher&quot;/&quot;Permit&quot;-class; sank, 129 killed)
* (1968; &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class; sank, 99 killed)
:Both sank for reasons unrelated to their reactor plants and still lie on the Atlantic sea floor.

===Russian or Soviet===

*K-8 (1960; November-class submarine; loss of coolant)
*K-19 (1961; Hotel-class submarine; two loss of coolant accidents, 27 killed due to one accident)
*K-11 (1965; November-class submarine; two refueling criticalities)
*K-159 (1965; November-class submarine; radioactive discharge)
*&quot;Lenin&quot; (1965; &quot;Lenin&quot;-class icebreaker; loss of coolant)
*&quot;Lenin&quot; (1967; &quot;Lenin&quot;-class icebreaker; loss of coolant)
*K-140 (1968; Yankee-class submarine; power excursion)
*K-8 (loss of coolant) (1970; November-class submarine; sank after fire, 52 killed)
*K-320 (1970; Charlie I-class submarine; uncontrolled startup)
*K-116 (1979; Echo II-class submarine; reactor accident)
*K-122 (1980; Echo I-class submarine; fire, 14 killed)
*K-222 (1980; Papa-class submarine; uncontrolled startup)
*K-27 (1982; Modified November-class submarine; scuttled)
*K-123 (1982; Alfa-class submarine; loss of coolant)
*K-429 (1983; Charlie I-class submarine; sank due to improper work at shipyard, 16 killed)
*K-431 (1985; Echo II-class submarine; refueling criticality, 10 killed)
*K-429 (1985; Charlie I-class submarine; sank at moorings)
*K-219 (1986; Yankee I-class submarine; sank, 6 killed)
*K-278 &quot;Komsomolets&quot; (1989; Mike-class submarine; sank, 42 killed)
*K-192 (1989; Echo II-class submarine; loss of coolant)
*K-141 &quot;Kursk (2000; Oscar II-class submarine; sank, 118 killed)
*K-159 (2003; November-class submarine; sank under tow, 9 killed)

:While not all of these were reactor accidents, they have a major impact on nuclear marine propulsion and the global politics because they happened to nuclear vessels. Only four Soviet nuclear submarines accidentally sank with nuclear weapons on board and remain on the sea floor to this day.

<text>The Committee on Evil Literature was a committee set up by the Irish Free State&#x27;s Department of Justice in 1926 to look into censorship of printed matter.

After independence in 1922, the authorities of the Irish Free State came under increasing pressure to ban materials considered obscene or liable to corrupt public morals. In October 1925, the Minister for Justice, Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, told &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; that existing obscenity laws were sufficient and the government had no right to further interfere with people&#x27;s personal freedom. He received heavy criticism for these remarks and mounting public pressure persuaded him, on 12 February 1926, to appoint a departmental committee, the Committee on Evil Literature, to consider and report &quot;whether it is necessary or advisable in the interest of the public morality to extend the existing powers of the State to prohibit or restrict the sale and circulation of printed matter&quot;.

==1926 committee==

The committee of three laymen and two clergymen, one Roman Catholic and one Church of Ireland, met at 24 Kildare Street, Dublin, between February and December 1926 to hear and consider submissions from a variety of sources, including the Garda, secular and religious organisations and members of the public, and reported to O&#x27;Higgins on 28 December. Its findings were that existing laws were inadequate to deal with obscene material and that the state had a duty to enforce controls on the production and distribution of obscene and &quot;morally corrupting&quot; literature. It also recommended the establishment of a censorship board.

The opinions of the committee, and those who submitted evidence to it on what should be banned, ranged very widely. Publications that the Roman Catholic Church considered to be obscene included the newspapers &quot;News of the World&quot;, &quot;The People&quot;, &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and the magazines &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Illustrated Police News&quot; and most girls&#x27; picture papers. The objection to the more populist newspapers appears to have been that their detailed reporting of murders and other violent crimes depraved the readers. All birth control literature was also considered to be obscene. Other examples of obscene literature submitted to the committee ranged from photographs of dancers to advertisements for depilatory cream.

The Committee on Evil Literature ceased to exist once its report was completed and presented to the Minister for Justice on 28 December 1926.

==1929 Censorship of Publications Board==

The Censorship of Publications Board was established under the Censorship of Publications Act 1929, and the scope of its work was expanded by two further acts in 1946 and 1967.

<text>Philippe Tatartcheff (born in Geneva, Switzerland) is a Canadian poet and songwriter. He is best known as the lyricist who wrote French language songs recorded by folk duo Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle.

==Origins and early life==
Tatartcheff&#x27;s family was originally from the Swiss Cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuchatel and Fribourg. After moving to Montreal in the early 1950s, they eventually settled in Timmins, Ontario, where his father, Dr. Michael Tatartcheff, was a physician and surgeon, and the town doctor. His grandfather, Dr. Assen Tatartcheff, was a member of the Macedonian Liberation Front IMRE.

Tatartcheff attended a French &quot;collège classique&quot; in Timmins, then McGill University before leaving for Paris in early 1969, to study for a master&#x27;s in French literature at the Sorbonne, where he presented a thesis on the subject of Jules Vallès. While at McGill, he met Anna McGarrigle, who was studying at Beaux-Arts at the time (1964-1968).

==Career==

In 1974, after Tatartcheff&#x27;s return to Montreal, Anna McGarrigle asked him to help her write a song, which became &quot;Complainte pour Ste. Catherine&quot;, featured on the sisters&#x27; debut album, &quot;Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle&quot; As McGarrigle recalled many years later: 
Tatartcheff would go on to contribute a total of twenty-four songs recorded by the McGarrigle sisters, most of them in French.

At some stage, he also became a farmer in Dunham, Quebec, according to the sleeve notes of the album &quot;The McGarrigle Hour&quot;.

<text>This is a chronological list of revolts organized by peasants.

== Background ==

The history of peasant wars spans over two thousand years. A variety of factors fueled the emergence of the peasant revolt phenomenon, including:

* Tax resistance 
* Social inequality 
* Religious war 
* National liberation 
* Resistance against serfdom 
* Land reform
* External factors such as plague and famine

Later peasant revolts such as the Telangana Rebellion were also influenced by agrarian socialist ideologies such as Maoism.

The majority of peasant rebellions ended prematurely and were unsuccessful. Peasants suffered from limited funding and lacked the training and organisational capabilities of professional armies.

<doc id="942358" wikidata="Q1440385" url="?curid=942358" title="Splash screen">
<text>A splash screen is a graphical control element consisting of a window containing an image, a logo, and the current version of the software. A splash screen can appear while a game or program is launching. A splash page is an introduction page on a website. A splash screen may cover the entire screen or web page; or may simply be a rectangle near the center of the screen or page. The splash screens of operating systems and some applications that expect to be run in full screen usually cover the entire screen.

== Purpose ==
Splash screens are typically used by particularly large applications to notify the user that the program is in the process of loading. They provide feedback that a lengthy process is underway. Occasionally, a progress bar within the splash screen indicates the loading progress. A splash screen disappears when the application&#x27;s main window appears. Splash screens may be added for a period of time and then replaced anew.

Splash screens typically serve to enhance the look and feel of an application or web site, hence they are often visually appealing. They may also have animations, graphics, and sound.

On the Web, a splash screen is a page of a web site that acts as a front page prior to displaying the home page. Designers may use splash pages:

* To direct users to the appropriate website for their country or language preference.
* To direct users to a low-bandwidth site or one more accessible to disabled users.
* As an additional form of advertising.
* to restrict access to content such as pornography, alcohol advertising or sales, or gambling.
* As an aesthetic complement to the main page.
* To grab someone&#x27;s attention to take them to a page with more details usually for a product that they are selling.
An early use of the splash screen on a Flash website was to enable the site developer to launch the site in a JavaScript-controlled new window without browser elements such as scroll-bars or an address bar, and in the exact size of the Flash movie. This has gone out of style with the predominance of pop-up blockers. Instead, many Flash web pages now allow their audience to choose to go to full screen viewing.

Since splash screens often increase the wait for the desired content and may take a long time to load, they are not liked by all users. Web splash screens are especially inconvenient for users with slow internet connections as the first page may take longer to load. Moreover, if the user has turned off rich content, such as images, Flash, or Shockwave, the splash page may not load at all. Splash pages and any associated main pages created in Flash often cannot be accessed by search engines or handled by text readers for the blind.

==Software support==

The Java programming language has a specific class for creating splash screens, called codice_1 that handles standard splash screen functions, e.g. display an image centered on screen that disappears when the first program window opens.

Splash screens can also be created in HTML and CSS if they are designed for a purpose other than as a loading screen. Instead, they are used for other purposes such as giving the option to pick the language.

The Android operating system (starting with Android 12) automatically generates a splash screen for every installed app, which can be customised by app developers. The Core Splashscreen Jetpack library backports this functionality for older Android versions.

<doc id="942366" wikidata="Q7934609" url="?curid=942366" title="Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets">
<text>The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets (VTCC) is the military component of the student body at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Cadets live together in residence halls, attend morning formation, wear a distinctive uniform, and receive an intensive military and leadership educational experience similar to those at the United States service academies. The Corps of Cadets has existed from the founding of the university as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1872 to the present-day institution of Virginia Tech, which is designated a senior military college by federal law. As of August 2024, about 1,300 cadets are currently enrolled in the program.

== Overview ==
The Corps provides leadership training for all of its cadets through two tracks: a Military-Leader Track for cadets enrolled in one of the three Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs, and the Citizen-Leader Track for cadets wishing to pursue civilian sector careers. Students in the Military-Leader track can pursue a commission in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Space Force. 

All cadets have the opportunity to receive an academic minor in Leadership through the Rice Center for Leader Development which is in the Virginia Tech Pamplin College of Business. To earn the minor, cadets must complete 22 academic credits and have three successful leadership positions within the Corps and or ROTC.

Around 80% of the cadets choose the Military-Leader Track. If a student is enrolled in an ROTC program at Virginia Tech, they must also be enrolled in the Corps of Cadets. However, a student does not have to be enrolled in an ROTC program in order to participate in the Corps. There are a few exceptions made for active duty enlisted students participating in programs such as the Army&#x27;s Green to Gold program. However, ROTC cadets may compete for four-, three-, and two-year ROTC scholarship opportunities that typically pay tuition, fees, an amount towards books, and a monthly stipend that ranges from $250 per month to $500 per month.

The remaining cadets choose the Citizen-Leader Track to pursue civilian careers or officer training or officer candidate training programs after graduation, or attend professional or graduate schools. Eighty-three percent of the Citizen-Leader Track cadets had a job or graduate school offer in hand upon graduation in May 2016. Recently, Northrop Grumman funded six scholarships for Citizen-Leader Track cadets or Military-Leader Track cadets not on scholarship which included an opportunity to intern with Northrop Grumman as well. Citizen-Leader Track cadets participate in an exercise called Job-Ex, where the junior and senior cadets learn to write a job description, freshman and sophomore cadets apply to those jobs, the upperclass cadets review them, and then they conduct panel interviews with the underclass cadets, so they can learn from their peers what is successful in an job interview. The upperclass cadets learn what interviewers expect, so they can improve their interviewing skills as well. The Rice Center Board of Advisors, made up from executives from organizations such as Northrop Grumman, Union Pacific, Dell, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, advise the Corps staff on curriculum and skill sets cadets need to develop to be more employable after graduation.

Women entered the VTCC in the fall of 1973 and created a single unit called L Squadron. By 1979, women were integrated into the line companies, though they still lived separately from the males in their units. In 1981, the residence halls became co-ed and women began to live in the same unit area as their male counterparts. In 1987, the first female Regimental Commanding Officer (CO) was appointed. To date, the Corps has had 12 female Regimental Commanding Officers. Today the Corps is at least 20% female and women hold leadership positions throughout the Corps.

==History==
===Early years of the Corps===
On October 1, 1872, Virginia Tech opened as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC). All students were cadets organized into a battalion of two companies with an enrollment of 132. The Commandant of Cadets was General James H. Lane, formerly the youngest general in the Army of Northern Virginia, who was wounded three times in combat. Based on his experience in the Civil War, as a student and teacher at VMI and UVA, and as a teacher at Florida State Seminary and North Carolina Military Institute, he wrote the first cadet regulations.

In 1878, VAMC President Charles Minor wanted to do away with the strict military requirements. Lane opposed him and their disagreement became so heated that a faculty meeting ended with a fistfight between the two. Both left campus in the ensuing scandal, but the Corps remained.

The VAMC cadets made their first Corps trip in 1875 to Richmond to the dedication of the Lee Monument. Over the years, the Corps has made many trips. These trips were more frequent in the early years including the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in 1901 and the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in 1904. In 1880, political mismanagement from Richmond contributed to enrollment dropping to just 78 cadets. But in the ensuing years, enrollment and educational opportunities were expanded. E Battery, manning four Civil War artillery pieces with upper classmen, existed between 1883 and 1907.
In 1896, VAMC, through an act of the Virginia Legislature, changed its name to the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. The name was quickly abbreviated in common usage to VPI. Also that same year, a tradition began that lasted nearly three-quarters of a century, the VPI-VMI annual football game in Roanoke. Known as the Military Classic of the South, the annual Corps trips and associated parades ended in 1970.

The first cadet barracks was opened in 1888. Known as Barracks No. 1, it would become the heart of the Corps and what would become the Upper Quad. It housed 130 students and had revolutionized campus amenities by having bathrooms containing hot and cold running water. In 1894 and 1900 respectively, Barracks No. 2 and Barracks No. 3 were constructed to add more dormitory space as the Corps outgrew the first barracks. Barracks No. 2 was later renamed to Rasche Hall while Barracks No. 3 became Brodie Hall. In honor of General Lane, Barracks No. 1 was renamed to Lane Hall in the 1950s. 

===Spanish–American War service===
In 1898, with the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, the VPI Corps of Cadets formally volunteered to the governor for combat service. This request was declined, but most of the VPI Cadet band and their director enlisted as the Band of the 2nd Virginia Infantry Regiment. Many alumni served in the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War. One alumnus (A.M. Gaujot. Class of 1901) was awarded the Medal of Honor during the Philippine–American War and another cited for gallantry at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. The Gaujot brothers remain the only two brothers in American history to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in two separate wars.

The VPI Cadet Band had first been organized in 1892. Prior to that, as early as 1883, music was provided by the &quot;Glade Cornet Band,&quot; an organization made up of people from the town of Blacksburg. The summer of 1902 saw the VPI Cadet Band serve as part of the 70th Virginia Infantry during large-scale national military maneuvers held in Manassas, Virginia. The VPI Cadet Band has been referred to as the Highty-Tighties since 1921.

===World War I===
Before U.S. entry into World War I, the ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) was established at Virginia Tech. The Infantry unit was established 21 December 1916. During the war, Virginia Tech essentially became an army post. Cadets were inducted and became enlisted men of the Student Army Training Corps and its Navy detachment. They wore Army and Navy uniforms during this period. Two Army training detachments of between 226 and 308 men each operated on campus.

Captain J. W. G. Stephens (class of 1915), of the 26th Infantry, led the first American forces &quot;over on top&quot; in combat near Montdidier, France. Many alumni served with distinction with the 1st, 2nd, 29th, and 80th Divisions, all of which saw heavy combat. Note must be made of Major Lloyd W. Williams (class of 1907), US Marine Corps. One of the famous quotes of the war, used for years as a Marine standard, was attributed to him. &quot;Retreat, Hell No!&quot; was his reply to the French orders to retreat his company. His company held its ground, but he was killed in the action and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. In the air, alumni, even as World War I foreshadowed VPI&#x27;s contribution to the Air Force, CPL Robert G. Eoff (class of 1918), French Foreign Legion, attached to the 157 French Fighter Squadron shot down the first of 6 enemy aircraft credited to Techmen. LT John R. Castleman (class of 1919) was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) for heroism in completing an aerial reconnaissance in spite of the attack of 12 enemy aircraft, two of which he shot down.

VPI&#x27;s contribution to the war effort during World War I included 2,297 men in uniform. These included 2,155 in the Army, 125 in the Navy, 19 in the Marine Corps, 6 in the Coast Guard, 1 in the British Army and 1 in the French Foreign Legion. One alumnus (Earle D. Gregory, Class of 1921) was awarded the Medal of Honor, seven the Distinguished Service Cross (United States), and one the Navy Cross. At least eight were awarded the Silver Star. Twenty-six died in service and another twenty-six were wounded. Based on this, VPI was designated as one of twelve &#x27;Distinguished Colleges&#x27; by the War Department.

Coast Artillery and Engineer ROTC units were established on the campus 29 December 1919. After World War I, veterans affected the Corps and VPI at large, both as new and returning cadets. In 1921, women were admitted to VPI as civilian students and attended classes as day students. The next year the Corps was reorganized into a regiment of two battalions. Two years later (1923) military service as a cadet was reduced from four years to two; however, after two years of the camaraderie of Corps life very few cadets chose to convert to civilian student status. During the national rail strike of 1923 the corps again volunteered to the Virginia Governor for active military service. They were not called upon. A Third Battalion was added to the regiment by 1927. Rapid growth followed as Virginia Tech&#x27;s reputation as both an outstanding academic and military institution grew. In 1939, a Fourth Battalion was added.

Following the war, the class of 1919 erected a memorial to &quot;Our Dead Heroes Over There,&quot; honoring the eleven cadets who died during World War I. Known as &quot;The Rock&quot;, it is a stone memorial with a bronze plaque and was placed between Brodie and Rasche Hall next to the flagpole on the Upper Quad. Since that time, it has grown to symbolize all graduates who have died in the line of duty. In honor of those cadets, all cadets in uniform salute the rock while cadets in civilian attire put their hand over their heart and look at it for six paces (as if performing an eyes-right movement).

===World War II===
During World War II, academic sessions and the Corps operated on a twelve-month cycle. The Corps had grown to a brigade of 2,650 cadets consisting of two regiments with a total of five battalions. The First Battalion was primarily Infantry ROTC. The Second Battalion was Engineer ROTC and the Third, Fourth and Fifth consisted of Cadet Batteries taking Coast Artillery ROTC. Because of the war, seniors were graduated and commissioned early. Juniors were on an accelerated schedule and brought on active duty. Finally, sophomores and freshmen over 18 were largely inducted into military service. The Corps soon numbered under 300 and was organized into a single battalion.

During the war, the Commandant of Cadets, in addition to the cadet battalion, supervised a unit of the Army Specialized Training Program and Army Specialized Training Reserve Program (ASTRP) (soldiers under 18 years of age) and a Navy pre-flight-training unit. These units included many former cadets, and adopted many of the traditions of the Corps, including the Honor Code and saluting the Rock. The young men of the ASRTP were actually uniformed in cadet gray. Once again VPI was largely an active duty military installation.Edward H. &quot;Buddy&quot; Dance, of Roanoke, was the President of the Corps of Cadets in the graduating class of 1942. He was, along with other seniors, graduated early. Dance was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps, but quickly rose to the rank of Major in the Air Force. He flew many missions and then taught others how to fly and fight in the air.

During World War II, 7,285 alumni served in uniform. The army had 5,941 men, the navy 1,095, 110 in the Marine Corps, 29 in the Merchant Marine, 23 in the Coast Guard, and one in the Royal Air Force. These included ten Brigadier Generals, five Major Generals, and one Rear Admiral. Three hundred twenty-three died, five were recipients of the Medal of Honor, seven the Distinguished Service Cross, two the Navy Cross, at least 73 the Silver Star, and 94 the Distinguished Flying Cross.

Following World War II, returning veterans were not required to serve in the Corps and the great influx of veterans swelled the number of civilian students. Civilian students out-numbered cadets for the first time in 1946. That same year Air Force ROTC was introduced to Virginia Tech. Initially civilian-cadet relations were not good as most veterans were attending Virginia Tech for the first time. Thanks to the regimental commander, Cadet Robertson (class of 1949), a World War II Coast Guard veteran, greater understanding was promoted among his fellow veterans and the Corps continued to grow and flourish.

During the following years the Corps would expand again back to a regiment and eventually organize into four battalion-size units. The Cadet 1st Battalion was housed at Radford Army Arsenal for two years at &quot;Rad-Tech.&quot; There, in World War II Army barracks, the cadets lived and took many of their classes. For unavailable classes, a fleet of buses brought them back to the main campus. As new dorms were completed the battalion returned to campus.

===Korean War===
During the Korean War, 1,867 corps alumni served, of whom 30 died in service. During the war, First Lieutenant Richard Thomas Shea Jr. (Class of 1949) received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions at Pork Chop Hill as a company commander. In 1952, the university employed a retired general (Major General John M. Devine) as the Commandant of Cadets. This was a departure from policy that had existed since 1884, in which the senior active duty military instructor functioned as commandant.

===1950s, 1960s, and 1970s===
In 1958, Virginia Tech became the first traditionally white southern college to graduate an African American, with the graduation of Cadet Charles Yates (class of 1958).

In a move to expand educational opportunities at Virginia Tech, the board of visitors made participation in the Corps completely voluntary starting in 1964. However, participation in ROTC continued to also require Corps membership. The Vietnam War period saw unrest on campus outside the Corps ranks. In 1970 demonstrations were conducted with the aim of halting Corps drill. Cowgill and Williams Hall were occupied and over 100 students were arrested. Other incidents occurred including the suspected arson of an on-campus building. Civilian-cadet relations were at an all-time low. Throughout all of this, the Corps maintained discipline and high esprit.

The post-Vietnam years saw the Corps numbers decline and reorganization to a two-battalion sized regiment. In 1973, Virginia Tech was among the first Corps of Cadets in the nation to enroll women, assigning them to L Squadron. In 1975, the first female cadet was assigned to Band Company. In 1979, L Squadron was disbanded and female cadets were integrated into the line companies. In 1991, the Cadet dormitories became co-ed.

===1980s and beyond===
The freshman &quot;Rat System&quot; converted to the &quot;New Cadet System&quot; in the fall of 1981. Naval ROTC was established in 1983. The cadet regiment expanded to a three-battalion structure in 1998, which grew to four in 2022. 

Early in his tenure as Commandant, Major General Randal D. Fullhart led a sweeping initiative to upgrade and consolidate Corps infrastructure on the Upper Quad precinct of campus. During his tenure, three new barracks were constructed: Pearson Hall East (2015), Pearson Hall West (2017), and Upper Quad Hall North (2023), collectively capable of housing over 1400 cadets within the Upper Quad. The Corps Leadership and Military Science Building was completed in 2023 to provide office space and classrooms for Corps and ROTC staff. In connection with these upgrades, Rasche, Brodie, Monteith, Femoyer, and Thomas Halls were demolished to create space for the new buildings. 

Today the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is one of six senior military colleges outside the five United States service academies. Virginia Tech is one of only three universities in the nation that maintains a full-time military environment within a larger civilian university; the others are Texas A&amp;M and University of North Georgia.

Since the Spanish–American War, the Corps has provided officers to the U.S. military. Corps alumni who have been decorated for valor include seven Medal of Honor recipients and eighteen recipients of the nation&#x27;s second highest award for valor, the Distinguished Service Cross or Navy Cross.

==Structure and operations==

The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is a cadet-run organization, consisting of over 1,200 members (as of fall 2021), and is modeled on an Army infantry regiment structure. The Corps is supervised by a senior leadership staff who establish cadet regulations and enforce baseline guidance for the running of the Corps. The day-to-day corps activities, however, are run primarily by the cadets themselves.

===Current structure===

All companies are co-ed and integrated with members of all tracks offered within the Corps. When a cadet first joins the Corps, they are assigned to a smaller training company attached to its larger parent company. Following their freshman year, cadets are shuffled into a different company in which they will remain until they graduate from the Corps of Cadets. In most cases, a cadet&#x27;s permanent company is in a different battalion than that of their freshman training company. 

In some companies, the freshmen section are often given their own nicknames such as TC 1-1 for Alpha Company freshmen, DEUCE DEUCE for Foxtrot freshman, Six-pack for Kilo freshmen, and colloquially mini golf and little Mike for freshmen in those companies. It is customary for graduates of the Corps to refer to themselves by the letter of their permanent company as well as their graduating year (e.g. N-25, A-86, etc.). 

Companies also have nicknames, such as the Foxtrot Panthers, however since the VTCC is currently a single regiment, no companies have the same letter destination and thus the nicknames are seldom used compared to company nicknames at West Point or Texas A&amp;M. Some companies have two mascots, where each platoon is named after one of the mascots.




Due to changing company ROTC affiliations between US Army Infantry/Engineers, Coast Artillery, and Air Corps (later US Air Force) ROTCs, units were designated as Companies, Batteries, and Squadrons respectively.

Between the Spring and Fall semesters of 1971, due to dwindling numbers, the number of units was cut in half, to avoid favoring units at the front of the line, all Companies, Batteries, and Squadrons were divided into pairs, with each pair constituting a new company. This updated lineage carries on to this day, even as units were “reactivated” beginning with India in the reconstituted 3rd Battalion, which was fully restored with the activation of Mike company in 2021. The Fourth battalion was reactivated in 2022, along with N and O Companies. 

It is important to note that when the companies I through O were reactivated, the reorganization of 1971 was not undone, essentially meaning that two units in the regiments (One company and one platoon) can claim the legacy of the letters I, K, L, M, N, and O (and R &amp; S if those companies were ever reactivated). For example, N and O Squadrons were combined into the &#x27;new&#x27; Golf Squadron meaning that Golf 1st Platoon, and November Company can both claim the legacy of the original N-Squadron. 

===Senior leadership===
The senior leadership is provided by the Commandant of Cadets, who is appointed by Virginia Tech and is a paid faculty member. Since 1952, the Commandant has been a retired general officer (most often a major general) from either the Army or Air Force. Of note, the Corps has never had a Commandant from the Navy or the Marine Corps (until Spring of 2025). The Commandant of Cadets is assisted by an executive officer in administrative matters and coordination with a number of university constituencies.

Other Corps leadership staff are the four Deputy Commandants who, along with four Senior Enlisted Advisors, oversee the cadet battalions along with one Deputy Commandant and an Assistant Deputy Commandant for the Citizen-Leader Track. There is also a Director of Alumni Development with an administrative assistant, and an Assistant Deputy Commandant for Recruiting. A Director of Communications coordinates communication efforts amongst the Corps&#x27; many audiences, and two Residential Life Coordinators are also assigned to the Corps in order to liaison between the Office of Housing and Residence Life and the Corps. The Director of the Rice Center for Leadership Studies oversees the leadership minor and curriculum for the cadets. The Director of the Regimental Band, the Highty Tighties, is also a member of the Commandant&#x27;s Staff. Also assigned are a Museum Curator, an athletic trainer (provided by Carilion), and two office and one scholarship manager. The Commandant of Cadets also oversees operation of the university&#x27;s Tailor Shop.

====Commandants of Cadets====
===Cadet leadership===
The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is organized in a way that is comparable to that of an army regiment. Each organizational level within the Corps has numerous additional staff billets. These can range from that of the regiment&#x27;s inspector general to fire team leaders who report to their respective platoons and companies.

===Rank structure===

&quot;New Cadet&quot; is the standard rank for all freshman upon entrance into the cadet corps. After the first six weeks, freshmen are promoted to the rank &quot;Cadet.&quot; Historically, some second semester freshmen were selected for the rank of Cadet Private, but they still wore a white cloth belt in contrast to Cadet Privates of other classes, who wear a black belt as an upperclassman but were sanctioned for various reasons. Selection of freshmen for the rank of Cadet Private last took place in the spring of 2018. A rank of &quot;Cadet Private First Class&quot; has occasionally existed for Cadet Privates with a high grade point average. In the early 2000s, the &quot;Cadet Private First Class&quot; rank was also issued to second semester freshman, who then technically outranked upperclassmen Cadet Privates, this practice was discontinued throughout the 2010s. In the spring of 2022, Second Battalion chose to revive the rank, designating it to members of the freshmen members of each company&#x27;s Eager Squad.

Cadets who do not hold a position associated with specific ranks are put at a default rank depending on their class year. Sophomores receive Cadet Corporal, juniors receive Cadet Sergeant, and seniors receive Cadet Second Lieutenant unless otherwise directed by sanctions or special circumstances. All seniors, regardless of billet, are designated as officers within the corps and likewise hold privileges associated with the status. This primarily includes parts of their uniforms such as having distinctive gold chinstraps, sabres, and single cross-belts. Fifth year seniors are referred to as &quot;Skipper Cadets&quot; or &quot;Skippers&quot; and wear a silver chin strap. A cadet of any class year who commits a serious infraction may be reduced in rank, often to Cadet Private.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;


==Cadet life==

Cadets at Virginia Tech are integrated within a larger civilian institution, much like that of Texas A&amp;M. This means that, excluding corps-specific classes and events, cadets interact with other students in classes, dining halls, clubs, Greek life, and most other aspects of college life. Weekend leisure time afforded to cadets is heavily dependent on one&#x27;s ROTC track, the football season schedule, and pre-planned regimental activities such as pass in review. 
Cadets are required to live in corps barracks primarily within the campus&#x27; Upper Quad. Due to enrollment growth, recent classes of cadets have also lived in other parts of campus while new residence halls are being constructed. Cadets live on a strictly regimented schedule during the week. This typically involves waking up early for physical training and morning formation. Room and uniform inspections can also be expected, with the frequency of them determined by one&#x27;s class. Freshman and sophomore cadets are given a curfew on weekdays in the form of evening call to quarters (ECQ). The presence of a military environment is intended to create a high degree of personal responsibility and discipline within every cadet. Cadets with more experience receive more personal freedom as well as increased responsibilities. 

===Freshman training system===

Freshmen in the Corps of Cadets (also known as First-Year Cadets, New Cadets, 4/C Cadets, or &quot;Rats&quot;) undergo a strenuous process of adapting to the military environment embodied by the Corps. This usually takes place over the course of a cadet&#x27;s first academic year, though transfers from both in and outside of the university also undergo this training system regardless of their academic status. Transfer students typically join their true academic class during subsequent years. Occasionally, a transfer cadet with only 4 remaining semesters may forego the second semester of their first year training in a process known as &quot;early turning.&quot; 

The life of a first-year cadet consists of many class-based restrictions. Most notably, these cadets are expected to both “drag” (briskly march on the right side of all halls and walkways) and sound off to all upperclassmen on the Upper Quad until they officially turn. Other “privileges” may be assigned based on the performance of an individual unit, which may be positive or negative in nature. These often include minor corrective actions like losing the right to use abbreviations, pockets, or particular facing movements when dragging.

====Before classes====
Prospective first-year cadets are required to arrive one week before the start of classes for training, also known as New Cadet Week. During this week, the new cadets are trained in drill with and without a weapon and also receive physical training to help prepare them for the rigors of leadership and the upcoming stresses of the academic year. The week ends with the New Cadet Parade, where the new cadets march under arms for their families and university staff, as well as a crowd of friends and fellow Virginia Tech students moving on to campus. The parade is intended to display the change in the new cadets and their acquisition of military knowledge and discipline . After this event, new cadets are given approximately 30 hours of pass so they can stay overnight off-campus with their families. However, beginning with the freshman class of 2026, New Cadets will be attending university and college information and academic sessions to prepare them for the start of the semester as part of Virginia Tech&#x27;s “Weeks of Welcome” programming. Following New Cadet Week, the returning upperclass who were not cadre, cadre training assistants, Color Guardsmen, Highty-Tighties, Commanders and their Staffs, Obstacle Course Team, Rappel Tower Committee, Skipper Crew, and Medical Staff move into their rooms.

====Red Phase====
The cadet training system at Virginia Tech has evolved throughout the decades, with each iteration seeking to improve the quality of leader produced by the program. Beginning with the class of 2004, the current cadet training system was implemented. The new cadets officially begin Red Phase upon returning from pass at 1830 (6:30 pm) for their first study hours Sunday evening. A freshman cadet typically has eight-and-a-half hours of unstructured time during a weekday in which to attend classes, study, run errands, and workout. Red Phase, like the color red, is the most intense phase, and the new cadets continue to be trained by their cadre (juniors and seniors who were specifically trained to train the freshmen). They will be expected to learn topics from &quot;The Guidon&quot;, the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets book of knowledge and will be quizzed on topics from the Guidon during &quot;Freshmen Online&quot;, more commonly referred to as &quot;onlines&quot;. Onlines are conducted Monday through Friday and last for one-half hour, However, as of the fall 2020 semester, freshmen training on weekdays has ceased with the exception of ROTC instruction. Onlines typically went away at the end of Red Phase. In addition to onlines, freshmen will begin having pass (also known as U-pass or Unity pass) every weekend night, where the cadre will conduct rigorous training reminiscent of New Cadet Week. Common activities during weekend pass include Guidon quizzes, physical training with and without rifles, dragging with and without rifles, and changing into uniforms or remaking beds under time constraints.

The Caldwell March I is named after Addison Caldwell, who walked to enroll as the first student at Virginia Agriculture and Mechanical College (V.A.M.C.) (Virginia Tech). The march commemorates Addison&#x27;s historic journey and is broken into two hikes. The fall hike begins at the Caldwell Homestead in Craig County and loosely follows the original hike along parts of the Appalachian Trail, before ending at a park named after the Caldwell brothers, &quot;Caldwell fields&quot;. Homer Hickam, a former cadet, and co-creator of Skipper sometimes joins the cadets on this momentous hike. The successful completion of the fall hike marks the end of the red phase for the first year cadets.

It is the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors&#x27; policy, that any freshman or transfer cadet who leaves the Corps before the end of Red Phase (which is usually defined by the university&#x27;s last day to withdraw without penalty in the fall semester), must leave the university and begin again in the spring semester (they do not have to re-apply to the university for admission).

====White Phase====
White Phase begins after the Caldwell March in October and lasts until the conclusion of Military Weekend in February. During White Phase, freshman cadets attend Cadet Leader School taught by the Commandant&#x27;s Staff and upperclassman cadets. During the Thursday afternoon period reserved normally for the Corps of Cadets lab, freshmen are educated in leadership responsibilities and role play scenarios to learn solutions to different situations. White Phase normally terminates at the annual Military Ball during Military Weekend (typically in the middle of February). During White Phase, weekend passes are still conducted by the cadre, however based on the previous week&#x27;s performance pass may be something enjoyable such as a group trip to a movie theater.

====Blue Phase====
At the beginning of Blue Phase, freshmen cadets are awarded new privileges and continue in their transition from follower-ship to leadership. Freshman cadets are evaluated during this time for their competence as Fire Team Leaders. Marking the end of freshmen cadet training year is the second half of the Caldwell March. After successful completion of the march, the freshman cadets are &quot;turned&quot; to upperclassman status for the remainder of the year. During this period, the freshman cadets will be partially integrated into their future companies, providing them with valuable acclimation time in order to prepare themselves for their sophomore challenges.

The Caldwell March II is the final march freshmen cadets will do before they turn and become upperclassmen. At the end of the march, all cadets will be at the VT to congratulate the completion of the freshmen cadets&#x27; march.

====Gold Phase====
In the Fall of 2024, cadet leadership has announced Gold Phase starting Spring of 2025.

===Organizations===

In addition to being involved in all other clubs the university has to offer, the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets sanctions over 30 additional organizations. The privilege to be a part of these activities is typically afforded to cadets in their second semester of their freshman year. Some of these organizations include:

*Air Force Flyers (Air Force ROTC)
*Armed Forces Special Operations Prep Team [AFSOPT] (Primarily Air Force ROTC but anyone can join)

==Uniforms and awards==

===Uniforms===
Cadets at Virginia Tech are required to wear the prescribed Uniform of the Day (UOD) from 0700 to 1700 Monday through Thursday and 0700–1400 on Friday. This is designated by the regimental staff and senior leadership of the Corps. Proper uniform wear and maintenance is a fundamental part of maintaining the military discipline essential to the Corps of Cadets. The ability to change out of uniforms at the end of the duty day and in particular portions of the Upper Quad is considered a privilege and likewise must be earned by a class. For first-year cadets, this typically comes late in the academic year.

While participating in a cadet&#x27;s individual ROTC&#x27;s activities and labs, they may change out of the Corps Uniform of the Day into the appropriate branch uniform after 1400 on Tuesdays during the fall semester. During the spring semester, ROTC uniforms may be assigned as the Uniform of the Day. Physical training uniforms for individual ROTC programs can be utilized in the mornings during which a cadet has PT.

====Dress uniforms====
Uniforms of this type are worn for more formal events. Ribbons, pins, and cords are authorized for wear.
*Dress A
: Consists of a blue blouse, white cross-belts, and black low-quarter shoes. Trousers and service covers are dependent on the season.
:: Summer - White trousers, service cover and white gloves.
:: Winter - Gray trousers, blue service color and black gloves.
: Seniors in this uniform can wear additional dress items such as sashes and sabres.
*Dress B
: Consists of a blue blouse and black low-quarter shoes. Trousers and service covers are dependent on the season.
:: Summer - White trousers and service cover.
:: Winter - Gray trousers and blue service color.
: Unlike that of Dress A, additional decorative garments and cross-belts aren&#x27;t worn in Dress B.
*Paletot Mess Dress
: Consists of a white blouse, white trousers, and black low-quarter shoes. Females have the option of wearing a white skirt and black pumps as an alternative.
: Designated as the formal mess uniform for all cadets, this is the most formal attire worn by the Corps and is usually reserved for banquets, balls, and ceremonies.

====Service uniforms====
These uniforms are the typical duty day uniforms of cadets and are worn at many different functions, usually without the expectation of strenuous physical activity which may tarnish them. Ribbons and pins are authorized for wear.
* Summer Service (&quot;White Shirt&quot;)
: Consists of a white shirt, gray trousers, black low-quarter shoes, black belt (white for freshmen), and blue service cover. Alternatively, garrison covers may be prescribed, though this is a rare occurrence and is seldom issued.
* Winter Service (&quot;Gray Bag&quot;)
: Consists of a gray shirt, gray trousers, black low-quarter shoes, black tie, black belt (white for freshmen), and blue service cover. Like in &quot;White Shirt,&quot; garrison covers may be worn.

====Other uniforms====
* Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCPs)
: Consists of a OCP blouse, cover, and trousers as well as tan boots and a sand undershirt. Some organizations within the Corps of Cadets are authorized berets in place of traditional OCP Patrol covers.
: This uniform can be worn to all functions at which a service uniform can be assigned, in addition to duties which require physical activity. As a result, it is considered one of the most versatile uniforms.
* &quot;Hokie Bag&quot;
: Consists of a maroon polo shirt, khaki trousers, and either a black belt and low quarters or a brown belt and brown shoes.
* Physical Training Uniform
: Consists of a black t-shirt, black shorts, and running shoes. In the winter, additional garments such as gloves, a long-sleaved maroon t-shirt, sweatshirts, and sweatpants are issued.

====Class distinguishing features====
Most notably, first-year cadets in the Corps of Cadets wear a white cloth belt in their service uniforms. This belt is known as the &quot;rat belt,&quot; after the nickname assigned to these cadets. On the last day of classes, the tradition of &quot;My Last Damn Rat Belt&quot; occurs when freshman cadets decorate each-others belts with signatures, slogans, and memories. This tradition is meant to signify the communal hardship shared by cadets in their first year. First-year cadets have no insignia on their covers while in OCPs. Similarly, freshmen do not have rank insignias on their uniforms (as expected of Cadet Privates) and can be distinguished by said absence. The trim of their garrison covers is black.

Typically ranking NCOs within the Corps of Cadets, sophomore and junior cadets have similar uniform appearances. In OCPs, the covers of these cadets display the Corps Crest. One can best distinguish these classes based on the sleeves of a cadet&#x27;s dress uniform, as the cuffs will have gold stripes which reflect the number of years a cadet has completed. Garrison covers have a red trim for sophomores and silver trim for juniors.

Senior cadets are the officers of the Corps. Likewise, they have numerous distinguishing features which come with their uniforms. In the Dress A uniform, seniors may adorn red sashes (known as OD and OG wraps), sabres, and capes depending on the occasion. On the collar of both dress uniforms, an underclassmen typically has two circular devices known as &quot;headlights&quot; which designate a particular cadet&#x27;s ROTC track. For seniors, these are replaced with larger gold insignias. Said insignias are also worn with a senior&#x27;s service uniforms. In the Winter Service uniform (&quot;Gray Bag&quot;), seniors have their ties fully extended while underclassmen tuck theirs between the second and third buttons. The service cover of seniors has a gold chinstrap, which contrasts with the black chinstraps of underclassmen. Fifth-year seniors (&quot;Skippers&quot;) have silver chinstraps. While in OCPs, senior cadets wear a gold VPI device on their covers. The trim of their garrison covers is gold.

===Awards===

====Beverly S. Parrish Jr. Memorial Award (&quot;Gold Cord&quot;)====
The Beverly S. Parrish Jr. Memorial Award is the award presented to the company with the highest number of points at the end of any given academic year. This award is graded based on various criteria such as academic performance, recruiting efforts, cadet retention, discipline, room and uniform inspections, and drill performance. The cadets of the winning company are given a gold cord, which may be worn with dress uniforms and is the sake of its nickname. The company itself is granted a plaque and a gold steamer to be hung atop the company&#x27;s guidon. The Gold Cord is the most anticipated and highly competitive award offered by the Corps, as it is the ultimate representation of all-around unit excellence within the Corps of Cadets.

====Ribbons and cords====
Ribbons and cords are given to cadets for a variety of achievements. This typically includes academic excellence, leadership performance, and membership in Corps organizations. Many of these awards overlap and have both a ribbon and cord associated with them. 

Ribbons and wreath devices are distributed to cadets based on one&#x27;s individual grade point average (GPA). It is often the first ribbon that a first-year cadet may wear on their uniforms.
* Gold Level: 3.75 - 4.0
* Orange Level: 3.4 - 3.74
* Maroon Level: 3.0 - 3.39

==Controversy==
In the fall of 2019, upperclassmen of Bravo Company organized a traditional sophomore integration, in which cadets engaged in physical exercise and were asked if they wished to partake in blood pinning. All but one sophomore chose to partake in the event. Later, the cadet who chose not to attend reported the event. While the school brought the incident to the authorities, no charges were filed in connection to the incident on the basis that it did not fulfill the legal definition of hazing. In 2020, cadet Darrien Brown was suspended for his role in the incident and subsequently filed suit over a lack of due process. Later that year, the school settled. While information was initially sealed, the school broke their non-disclosure within the month.

==Notes==
:1.From the day of its founding to the present Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University has had a commandant of cadets. The session of 1880-1882 is unique however. The Board of Visitors failed to appoint either a commandant or a president. Acting President Hart there upon appointed a senior cadet as acting commandant and permitted this individual to select other seniors as acting assistant commandants. With this one exception all commandants have been appointed by the Board of Visitors.&quot;

<text>Edwin LeMar &quot;Buddy&quot; Cole (December 15, 1916 – November 5, 1964) was a jazz pianist, organist, orchestra leader, and composer. He played behind a number of pop singers, including Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby.

==Biography==
Cole was born in Irving, Illinois, on December 15, 1916 and the family moved to California when he was two. One of his two sisters - Bertie - played for silent movies and Buddy would watch as a little boy. At the age of ten, he debuted on the theater piano, filling in for someone who had not turned up. He started his musical career in the theater playing between movies and his first keyboard job was as theater organist at Los Angeles&#x27; Figueroa Theater. He was recruited to be part of Gil Evans&#x27;s band at the age of 19. In Hollywood in the second half of the 1930s Cole played in dance bands, including those led by Alvino Rey and Frankie Trumbauer. He married Yvonne King, member of The King Sisters, in 1940 and they had two daughters, Christine and Cathleen. They divorced in 1953. He married Regina Woodruff (known as Clare) on November 12, 1955 in Las Vegas but they separated on July 6, 1956 prior to a divorce on September 20 the same year. As soon as the divorce became final, Cole and Clare remarried in Los Angeles on November 12, 1957. From the 1940s, his main work was as a studio musician, utilizing piano, electric organ, celeste, harpsichord and Novachord.

In 1947, Cole joined the John Scott Trotter Orchestra working for Bing Crosby on his radio shows and he remained with Trotter until 1954. Crosby then dispensed with the services of a large orchestra and instead employed Cole and his trio to support him on his radio programs such as &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot; and &quot;The Bing Crosby – Rosemary Clooney Show&quot;. Cole performed on Bing Crosby&#x27;s hits &quot;In a Little Spanish Town&quot; and &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, and on the albums &quot;Some Fine Old Chestnuts&quot; and &quot;New Tricks&quot;. Cole also played on Rosemary Clooney&#x27;s radio program; some recordings from the show were released on the album &quot;Swing Around Rosie&quot;.

In his capacity as a studio musician, Cole worked with Henry Mancini, who used his Hammond organ sound for the soundtrack to the TV series &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;. Cole also recorded several organ albums for Warner Brothers, Columbia, Alshire and Doric.

Cole played most of the piano parts in the 1951 film &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot;, subbing for Hoagy Carmichael, who appeared on screen. Cole also wrote the music for the television game show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;. He died in Hollywood on November 5, 1964.

<text>Nonpoint is an American heavy metal band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The band currently consists of vocalist Elias Soriano, drummer Robb Rivera, rhythm guitarist Rasheed Thomas, bassist Adam Woloszyn, and lead guitarist Jaysin Zeilstra.

Nonpoint was formed in 1997 by Rivera and Soriano. They released two independent demo albums in the 1990s, followed by their major label debut album, &quot;Statement&quot;, in 2000. Over the years, Nonpoint released numerous albums, with their most recent, &quot;X&quot;, released in 2018. The band has toured extensively and has had their music featured in various video games, movies, and soundtracks. In April 2021, Nonpoint announced the creation of their independent record label, 361 Degrees Records.

==History==

===Early years (1997–2004)===
During the early 1990s, drummer Robb Rivera formed a band named Nonpoint Factor. The band released various demos and its lineup changed numerous times, with Rivera as the only constant member. By 1997, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to simply &quot;Nonpoint&quot;, and the lineup was restructured with Rivera on drums, Elias Soriano on vocals, Ken MacMillan on bass, and Andrew Goldman on guitar. The name Nonpoint came from a Believer song named &quot;Nonpoint&quot;. Soriano recalls: &quot;I dug the name so I started using it around that time. It has no real meaning to us. It has something to do with pollution, but to us it just sounded cool.&quot; The band self-released their first independent album, &quot;Separate Yourself&quot;, in late 1997. Another independent album, &quot;Struggle&quot;, was released on May 18, 1999, on the now-defunct Jugular Records.

The band released their debut major label album &quot;Statement&quot; on October 10, 2000, via MCA Records. To promote the album, as well as the band on a nationwide scale, Nonpoint toured with such artists as Hed PE, Mudvayne, Fuel, Taproot, and Drowning Pool, with their main tour appearing on the United States leg of the 2001 Ozzfest tour. A year after its release, the album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, where it peaked at No. 166. The first single from the album, &quot;What a Day&quot;, peaked at No. 24 on the Mainstream Rock charts.

Nonpoint&#x27;s second album &quot;Development&quot; was released on June 25, 2002. The album entered the Billboard charts at No. 52, with the first single released from the album, &quot;Your Signs&quot;, peaking at No. 36 on the Mainstream Rock charts. Nonpoint completed a successful second appearance at Ozzfest, during the Donington Park leg of the European tour. Other tours included Sevendust on the first Locobazooka tour, dates with Filter, Sunset Black, and Papa Roach. A second single, &quot;Circles&quot;, was featured in NASCAR Thunder 2003, as well as the soundtrack for Hot Wheels AcceleRacers.

Two years after the release of &quot;Development&quot;, Nonpoint released their third major album &quot;Recoil&quot; on August 3, 2004, via their new label Lava Records. The album entered the Billboard charts at No. 115. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Truth&quot;, peaked at No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock charts. Another single, &quot;Rabia&quot; was later released.

=== Middle years (2005–2009) ===
After departing from Lava Records, Nonpoint signed with independent label Bieler Bros. Records. The label&#x27;s co-owner, Jason Bieler, produced the band&#x27;s previous three albums. Nonpoint re-emerged with their fourth major album &quot;To the Pain&quot; on November 8, 2005. The album entered the Billboard charts at No. 147, with approximately 9,000 copies sold during its first week of release. The single, &quot;Bullet with a Name&quot;, peaked at No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock charts and was featured on the game &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot; and 2007 film &quot;The Condemned&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, peaked at No. 25. The song was also featured on the game &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot;. &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, which was previously featured on the &quot;Recoil&quot; album, was the theme song for the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; movie. It made a belated appearance on the Mainstream Rock charts, peaking at No. 34. Beginning in late 2005, Nonpoint toured extensively with Sevendust for three months, later concluding the tour in New Hampshire. Nonpoint toured on the third annual Music as a Weapon Tour with Disturbed, Stone Sour and Flyleaf. The band also did tours with Sevendust and Buckcherry.

Nonpoint released a CD and DVD set, &quot;Live and Kicking&quot;, on November 7, 2006. The live album was recorded at the band&#x27;s April 29, 2006, show in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The album sold 3,475 copies during its first week of release.

As of 2019, &quot;To the Pain&quot; has sold over 130,000 copies in the United States.

On November 6, 2007, Nonpoint released their fifth major album, &quot;Vengeance&quot;, under Bieler Bros. Records. The album sold 8,400 copies in the first week. Vengeance peaked at 129th on the Billboard charts. The first single, &quot;March of War&quot;, was released early on the band&#x27;s Myspace page, as well as a sample of the lead track &quot;Wake Up World&quot;. For the second year in a row one of their songs was featured in the franchise of &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;. The song was a remix of &quot;Everybody Down&quot; from the album.

They went on the first ever Great American Rampage Tour. Nonpoint headlined the What Does Not Kill You tour with 12 Stones and Anew Revolution. The band announced that in February 2009 they would embark on a tour with Mudvayne and In This Moment.

On January 20, 2009, drummer Robb Rivera announced that the band had parted ways with Bieler Bros. and were seeking a new label and management. Nonpoint later signed on with Split Media LLC.

Nonpoint recorded demos in Phoenix in May 2009. Nonpoint released a new acoustic EP digitally through their own label, 954 Records, on December 8. Dubbed, &quot;Cut The Cord&quot;, the outing features acoustic renditions of &quot;What a Day&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Rabia&quot;, &quot;Victim&quot;, and &quot;Your Signs&quot;.

Nonpoint streamed a cover of Pantera&#x27;s &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot; on their MySpace. The track is a bonus track for the &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine tribute to &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott which was made available on December 16. The Pantera cover was later featured on their sixth studio album, &quot;Miracle&quot;.

=== Recent years (2010–present) ===
The band started work on their sixth studio album in late 2009, with plans to release it early to mid-2010. In February 2010, they released the first single and title track off the new album, &quot;Miracle&quot;, along with a release date of April 27. About a month later, the release was pushed back a week to May 4.

At the time of its release, &quot;Miracle&quot; was No. 59 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, the second highest debut of the band&#x27;s career, also reaching No. 5 on the Rock Albums chart in the week following the release. The second single, &quot;Frontlines&quot;, was released in August, and was inspired by the military and their daily risk-taking to protect the United States.

During late February and early March, the band performed at Soundwave in Australia. This marked the first time the band had played there in their career. They also released a free download of their cover of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.

The &quot;Icon&quot; compilation—part of a series released by the label with other artists—spanned the band&#x27;s earlier major label work and included a number of rarities, including an acoustic version of their song &quot;What a Day&quot;, plus the rare songs &quot;Across The Line&quot; and &quot;Pickle&quot;. The set surfaced through UMG on April 5. The song &quot;Across the Line&quot; made its appearance in NASCAR Thunder 2004 before appearing in the greatest hits album.

The band stated that they had been writing new music and that they planned to start recording a new album at the end of the year through Razor &amp; Tie. They released a free advanced mix of a song off the album titled &quot;I Said It&quot;. Another track, &quot;Left for You&quot;, was later released.
It was confirmed through Nonpoint&#x27;s Facebook page that they would be recording for a DVD when they play their show in their hometown on May 8.

Nonpoint completed the recording process for their self-titled seventh studio album with producer Johnny K. The band released the song &quot;I Said It&quot;, and made plans to tour with Call Me No One.

The band later announced that the album would be released on September 18, 2012. It was pushed to October 9, 2012. Nonpoint released a music video for Left For You on October 1, 2012.

In early January 2014, Nonpoint announced on Facebook that they were working on a new album: &quot;Update. We are writing a new album. Really blown away with what we have done so far. If you liked the last album then you will dig this new stuff. From what I can hear we are digging deeper into our influences. Really exciting.&quot;

Nonpoint signed with Metal Blade Records for areas outside of North America. They remain signed to Razor &amp; Tie for North American releases.

The band&#x27;s new album titled &quot;The Return&quot; was released on September 30, 2014. Also Nonpoint released the song &quot;Breaking Skin&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single on August 12, 2014. Not long after the album&#x27;s release, BC Kochmit (Eye Empire, Switched) took over Dave Lizzio&#x27;s role as Nonpoint&#x27;s lead guitarist.

While playing a show at Amos Southend in Charlotte, North Carolina on the Crack the Sky tour with 10 Years, the band revealed they had begun work on their ninth studio album and that they would enter begin recording in February 2016. It was announced on October 15, 2015, that the band had signed with Spinefarm Records. In early May the band announced the 14-track album and the first song, &quot;Generation Idiot&quot; via their official Facebook page. &quot;The Poison Red&quot; was released on July 8, 2016. Nonpoint revealed plans to take a hiatus from touring in 2018.

The band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;X&quot;, was released on August 24, 2018. The band released a lyric video for the song &quot;Dodge Your Destiny&quot; on June 22 while simultaneously releasing &quot;Chaos and Earthquakes&quot; as the first radio single, with an official video for the latter premiering on the band&#x27;s YouTube channel on August 16.

In April 2021, Nonpoint announced that they had created their own independent record label called 361 Degrees Records.

== Musical style and influences ==
Nonpoint have been described as nu metal, alternative metal, hard rock, groove metal, and rap metal. Vocalist Elias Soriano views Nonpoint both as a metal band and a rock band, elaborating, &quot;We don&#x27;t try to pigeonhole ourselves.&quot;

Originally playing an aggressive style, Nonpoint moved to more melodic sounds with their 2002 album &quot;Development&quot;, due to pressure from their record label MCA. The 2004 album &quot;Recoil&quot; marked a return to the band&#x27;s heavier roots. In a 2000 interview, Soriano reflected on the band&#x27;s musical influences, stating &quot;We all have a lot of separate influences. My drummer comes from a more metal/hardcore background. My bass player is from the straight edge hardcore, Earth Crisis, Hatebreed, stuff like that. My guitar player is really into Stevie Ray Vaughan and blues and a lot of industrial stuff like Nine Inch Nails. Me personally, I grew up on a lot of R&amp;B, a lot of rap. I&#x27;m into that smooth, soulful sound.&quot; The band&#x27;s self-titled album &quot;[added] a dash of post-grunge to the mix,&quot; according to AllMusic.

Nonpoint frequently use frog symbolism (specifically that of the coquí, a group of several species native to Puerto Rico) on their album covers, as well as in vocal samples in &quot;Development&quot;.

<text>Joan Marjorie Dingley (14 May 1916 – 1 January 2008) was one of the pioneer women of New Zealand science. She worked for the DSIR Plant Diseases Division from 1941 to 1976, becoming the head of mycology. She was a major research scientist in New Zealand for both laboratory and field-based plant pathology, and for taxonomic mycology.

== Early life ==
Dingley was born in Parnell, Auckland on the 14 May 1916 to Harriet Griffiths and Captain Thomas Dingley. She was the second-youngest child in the family, who re-located to the Auckland suburb of Remuera in the early 1920s, where Dingley would live for the rest of her life. Her father died in 1925, when she was nine.

Dingley&#x27;s mother was an enthusiastic gardener and encouraged her daughter&#x27;s interest in plants. This interest was also encouraged by Dingley&#x27;s schools, including the Ladies&#x27; College of Remuera and Auckland Diocesan School for Girls.

She studied science at Auckland University College, majoring in zoology and biology. She graduated in 1941 with an MSc.

== Life and career ==
Her research interests lay with the taxonomy of ascomycetes, especially the Hypocreales. She rapidly became a world authority on these fungi. About 30 species of fungi have &quot;dingleyae&quot; as their species name, and the genus &quot;Dingleya&quot; was also named after her.

She wrote a major, comprehensive list of New Zealand plant diseases, &quot;Records of plant diseases in New Zealand,&quot; published in 1969.

Dingley developed the New Zealand Fungal Herbarium, building specimen numbers from 4,000 to 35,000 by the time she retired.

Dingley also had a love for horticulture and gardening. She was a prime mover in the establishment of the Auckland Regional Botanic Gardens, and became an honorary life member of the ‘Friends’ of the gardens.

== Honours and awards ==
Dingley was awarded an honorary DSc by Massey University in 1994. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services to botany. In 2004, Landcare Research named one of its Auckland laboratories the JM Dingley Microbiology Laboratory in her honour. She attended the naming ceremony.

In 2017, Dingley was selected as one of the Royal Society Te Apārangi&#x27;s &quot;150 women in 150 words&quot;, celebrating the contributions of women to knowledge in New Zealand.

<text>A viral plaque is a visible structure formed after introducing a viral sample to a cell culture grown on some nutrient medium. The virus will replicate and spread, generating regions of cell destruction known as plaques. For example, Vero cell or other tissue cultures may be used to investigate an influenza virus or coronavirus, while various bacterial cultures would be used for bacteriophages.

Counting the number of plaques can be used as a method of virus quantification. These plaques can sometimes be detected visually using colony counters, in much the same way as bacterial colonies are counted; however, they are not always visible to the naked eye, and sometimes can only be seen through a microscope, or using techniques such as staining (e.g. neutral red for eukaryotes or giemsa for bacteria) or immunofluorescence. Special computer systems have been designed with the ability to scan samples in batches.

The appearance of the plaque depends on the host strain, virus and the conditions. Highly virulent or lytic strains create plaques that look clear (due to total cell destruction), while strains that only kill a fraction of their hosts (due to partial resistance/lysogeny), or only reduce the rate of cell growth, give turbid plaques. Some partially lysogenic phages give bull&#x27;s-eye plaques with spots or rings of growth in the middle of clear regions of complete lysis.

<text>PZL Mielec (&quot;Polskie Zakłady Lotnicze&quot; - Polish Aviation Works), formerly WSK-Mielec (&quot;Wytwórnia Sprzętu Komunikacyjnego&quot;) and WSK &quot;PZL-Mielec&quot; is a Polish aerospace manufacturer based in Mielec. It is the largest aerospace manufacturer in postwar Poland. In 2007, it was acquired by Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, which retained the brand name. Between 1948 and 2014, the company manufactured approximately 15,600 aircraft.

==History==

===Before 1945===
In 1938-1939, &quot;Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze&quot; (&quot;State Aviation Works&quot;; PZL), Poland&#x27;s largest aviation company, built a factory in Mielec, designated PZL WP-2 (&quot;Wytwórnia Płatowców 2&quot;; &quot;Airframe Factory no. 2&quot;). Production there began just before the outbreak of World War II. In March 1939, the plant began manufacturing its first aircraft — PZL.37 Łoś bombers, assembled from components delivered from the PZL WP-1 factory in Warsaw. There were 700 workers at that time.




During World War II, Mielec was occupied by Nazi Germany, starting 13 September 1939. During the occupation, the factory became a part of Heinkel, among others producing tailfins of Heinkel He 111 bombers, and repairing Junkers Ju 52 aircraft. There were 5,500 workers in 1944. In July 1944, the withdrawing Germans took away all the machines and equipment. Mielec was seized by the Soviet Army on 6 August 1944. At first, the factory was used by the Soviets as a repair works. On 22 July 1945, it was handed back to Polish control.

===1945 to present===
The factory in Mielec was renamed to &quot;Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze (PZL) - Zakład nr 1&quot; (&quot;State Aviation Works, No.1 plant&quot;), and turned into a state-owned factory. At first, it undertook aircraft repair works, and produced mostly non-aviation items, such as bus bodies, scales, etc. The first aircraft constructed in Mielec was a simple trainer PZL S-1, flown on 15 November 1945, of which only one unit was built (this was the second aircraft built in Poland after the war).

The factory in Mielec produced aircraft mostly under license, or designed in other Polish bureaus. In 1948, the factory built a small series of 10 utility aircraft LWD Szpak-4T, designed in the LWD (it was the first Polish post-war series-built aircraft). In the same year, the company started producing licensed Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes under the designation CSS-13, and 180 were built by 1950 (they were also produced by PZL Warszawa-Okęcie). In 1950, also a small series of pre-war Polish Salamandra gliders was built.

In 1949, the factory was renamed, like all Polish aerospace industry at that time, as &quot;Wytwórnia Sprzętu Komunikacyjnego – zakład nr 1&quot; (&quot;Communication Equipment Factory, No. 1 plant&quot;), in short WSK-1 Mielec or just WSK-Mielec. For a short time in 1970-1975, it bore a name WSK Delta-Mielec. In 1975, it returned to a traditional name &quot;Wytwórnia Sprzętu Komunikacyjnego &quot;PZL-Mielec&quot;&quot; (WSK &quot;PZL-Mielec&quot;), in an honor of the PZL brand. In the 1950s, there were 2600 workers; at its peak the number was 18,000.

From 1950, the factory developed significantly, and became the largest Polish aircraft producer. It was a licensed producer of the Soviet-designed jet fighters MiG-15 (produced as Lim-1), MiG-15bis (Lim-2), MiG-17 (Lim-5), and their Polish-developed variants (the SBLim-1 and SBLim-2 trainers and the Lim-6 attack aircraft). The first Lim-1s were manufactured from Soviet parts in 1952, and full-scale production started in 1953. About 1500 Lims were built by 1964. In 1957-1960, there were also produced 250 Polish-designed TS-8 Bies piston-engined trainers. From 1963, there was produced Polish-designed jet trainer TS-11 Iskra, being a basic trainer in Polish military aviation. Its successor, designed with a part of PZL Mielec, the PZL I-22 Iryda, appeared to be a failure for different reasons, mostly due to a lack of proper funding, and as such only a small series was built.

The most numerous aircraft built in Mielec was the licensed Soviet Antonov An-2 utility biplane, produced from 1960 in different variants. 11,954 of these aircraft were manufactured by 2002, mostly for the Soviets, but also used in Poland, and exported to other countries. Among them there were 7880 agricultural An-2R, 1640 transport-passenger An-2TP, 1344 transport An-2T, 816 passenger An-2P, 154 An-2M floatplanes, 52 An-2TD military paratroop transports, 44 executive An-2P Lux. From 1984, PZL Mielec became an exclusive producer of the Soviet Antonov An-28 STOL transport aircraft, of which 180 were built. It was subsequently developed in Mielec, and in a modernized variant PZL M-28 Skytruck/Bryza, with western avionics, was offered for the Polish Army, Polish Navy and services abroad, with some success, also as a maritime patrol aircraft.

Apart from license production, several aircraft were designed at Mielec in the 1950s and 1960s, but they did not enter production (e.g PZL S-4 Kania, PZL M-2, PZL M-4 Tarpan). More profitable was cooperation in design work. In 1973, with Soviet aid, Mielec designed the only jet agricultural aircraft in the world, the WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor, which was built between 1976 and 1981 for the Soviets. On the other hand, the factory started cooperation with American firms, and the result was the very successful agricultural aircraft M-18 Dromader, first flown in 1976, and produced and developed until now (as of 2012). Over 759 were produced, most exported to Western countries. WSK-Mielec also started production of the PZL M-20 Mewa utility aircraft (licensed Piper PA-34 Seneca), but a small number was built only. Partly based on the M-20, the factory developed a successful light trainer PZL M-26 Iskierka of 1988; however, only seven were built.

===Non-aviation production===
The factory produced also non-aviation items, like fire engines (1948), refrigerators (1954–1966), Mikrus MR-300 microcar (1956–1960, 1728 built), refrigerator car bodies (1962–1974), TV broadcast cars (from 1965), fuel injection equipment (from 1964), Leyland-licence diesel engines (from 1967), Melex electric utility vehicles and golf carts (from 1970, mostly for export to the USA, later separated as own brand). In 1993, a division &quot;Wytwórnia Aparatury Wtryskowej &quot;PZL Mielec&quot;&quot; (&quot;Fuel Injection Equipment Factory &quot;PZL–Mielec&quot;&quot;) was separated as a limited liability company.

===Present and future===
On 19 October 1998, a state-owned factory WSK &quot;PZL-Mielec&quot; was converted into a state-owned company &quot;Polskie Zakłady Lotnicze&quot; Mielec Sp. z o.o. (&quot;Polish Aviation Works&quot;), in short: PZL Mielec (not to be confused with pre-war PZL - &quot;Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze&quot;). In May 1999, it was certified according to JAR-21. After a fall of export to Eastern Bloc countries, production volume decreased, and there remained 1200-1400 workers.

On 16 March 2007, PZL Mielec was acquired by the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, then a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX), now a unit of Lockheed Martin. From 2009, it manufactures fuselage sections of the parent firm&#x27;s UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter, and from 2010 it serves as an additional final assembly line for S-70i Black Hawk helicopters.

The circumstances of this transaction and its aftermath were heavily criticized by the Polish military press, suggesting that the price was very low (56.1 million PLN), due to pro-American lobbying. It was also pointed out that the Polish military agreed in December 2008 to purchase 12 unnecessary M-28B aircraft from the new factory owners, for a price two or three times higher than their real value and export price.

<text>The Slovene peasant revolt (, ), also known as the All-Slovene Peasant Uprising (), took place in 1515 and was the largest peasant revolt in the Slovene Lands. It engulfed most of what is now Slovenia as well as a significant portion of the province of Carinthia, which today is a part of Austria. There were about 80,000 rebels who demanded the reintroduction of the original feudal obligations and trade rights (the so-called &quot;old rights&quot;; ) and a right to decide about the taxes. The spark which started this uprising was when the ethnic German peasants of the Gottschee region killed their lord Jorg von Thurn. They attacked the castles within the region, except in the territory of the County of Görz, where conflicts were solved through negotiations. The revolt was put down by the mercenaries of the Holy Roman Empire, with the deciding battle fought at Celje. The words &quot;stara pravda&quot; were printed in 1515 in Vienna in a poem of the German mercenaries and were the first printed Slovene words.

<doc id="942468" wikidata="Q4184716" url="?curid=942468" title="Rain Rain Go Away">
<text>&quot;Rain, Rain, Go Away&quot; is a popular English language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19096 and many different variations of it have been recorded.

==Lyrics==
There are several versions and variations of this rhyming couplet. The most common modern version is generally

but sometimes with different conclusions recorded.

Similar rhymes can be found in many societies, including ancient Greece and ancient Rome. The modern English language rhyme can be dated at least to the 17th century, when James Howell in his 1659 collection of proverbs noted &quot;Raine, raine, goe to Spain: faire weather come againe&quot;. At the same period John Aubrey noted that &quot;little children have a custom when it raines to sing or charme away the Raine; thus they all joine in a chorus and sing &quot;Raine, raine, goe away, Come againe a Saterday&quot;&quot;, while a book of prognostications for 1829 provides &quot;come again tomorrow day&quot;. 

A wide variety of other alternatives has been recorded for when the rain may return, including: &quot;Midsummer day&quot;, &quot;washing day&quot;, &quot;Christmas Day&quot; and &quot;on Martha&#x27;s wedding day&quot;, while in the mid-19th century James Orchard Halliwell collected the version:

 At much the same time, a parallel charm against the rain was noted as
Still other regional variations were collected during the 19th century and later. In Scotland the rain was bidden &quot;Rain, rain, gang to Spain, And never come back again&quot;, while elsewhere various bribes were offered to make it go away. In Northumberland, for example, &quot;When I brew, and when I bake, I&#x27;ll gie you a little cake&quot;; in Cornwall this was further specified as &quot;You shall have a figgy cake, And a glass of brandy&quot;. In Yorkshire, after it has been told to go away, it is further exhorted, &quot;Rain, rain, come down and pour, Then you&#x27;ll only last an hour&quot;; in Norfolk this changes to &quot;Go to France and go to Spain, And mind you don’t come back again&quot;.

The song is also known in the U. S. where, in North and South Carolina, the rain is informed that

<text>&quot;Misirlou&quot; ( &lt; &#x27;Egyptian&#x27; &lt; &quot;Miṣr&quot; &#x27;Egypt&#x27;) is a folk song from the Eastern Mediterranean region. The song&#x27;s original author is unknown, but Arabic, Greek, and Jewish musicians were playing it by the 1920s. The earliest known recording of the song is a 1927 Greek rebetiko/tsifteteli composition. There are also Arabic belly dancing, Albanian, Armenian, Serbian, Persian, Indian and Turkish versions of the song. This song was popular from the 1920s onwards in the Arab American, Armenian American and Greek American communities who settled in the United States.

The song was a hit in 1946 for Jan August, an American pianist and xylophonist nicknamed &quot;the one-man piano duet&quot;. It gained worldwide popularity through Dick Dale&#x27;s 1962 American surf rock version, originally titled &quot;Miserlou&quot;, which popularized the song in Western popular culture; Dale&#x27;s version was influenced by an earlier Arabic folk version played with an oud. Various versions have since been recorded, mostly based on Dale&#x27;s version, including other surf and rock versions by bands such as the Beach Boys, the Ventures, and the Trashmen, as well as international orchestral easy listening (exotica) versions by musicians such as Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman. Dale&#x27;s surf rock version was heard in the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.

== History ==
=== Name ===
Misirlou (Μισιρλού), due to the suffix &quot;ou&quot;, is the feminine form (in Greek) of Misirlis (Μισιρλής- a surname) which comes from the Turkish word Mısırlı, which is formed by combining Mısır (&quot;Egypt&quot; in Turkish, borrowed from Arabic Miṣr) with the Turkish -lı suffix, literally meaning &quot;Egyptian&quot;. Therefore, the song is about an Egyptian woman. The original Turkish word &quot;Mısırlı&quot; is, however, genderless.

=== Composition ===
The folk song has origins in the Eastern Mediterranean region of the Ottoman Empire, but the original author of the song is not known. There is evidence that the folk song was known to Arabic musicians, Greek rebetiko musicians and Jewish klezmer musicians by the 1920s. The claim in some sources that the tune derives from the song &quot;Bint Misr&quot; (&quot;Egyptian Girl&quot;) written by Egyptian musician Sayed Darwish is thought to be incorrect.

The earliest known recording of the song was by the rebetiko musician Theodotos (&quot;Tetos&quot;) Demetriades () in 1927. Demetriades, an Ottoman Greek, was born in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, in 1897, and he resided there until he moved to the United States in 1921, during a period when most of the Greek speaking population fled the emerging Turkish state. It is likely that he was familiar with the song as a folk song before he moved to the United States. As with almost all early rebetika songs (a style that originated with the Greek refugees from Asia Minor in Turkey), the song&#x27;s actual composer has never been identified, and its ownership rested with the band leader. Demetriades named the song &quot;Misirlou&quot; in his original 1927 Columbia recording, which is a Greek assimilated borrowing of the regional pronunciation of &quot;Egyptian&quot; in Turkish (&quot;Mısırlı&quot;), as opposed to the corresponding word for &quot;Egyptian&quot; (female) in Greek, which is (&quot;Aigyptia&quot;).

The rebetiko version of the song was intended for a Greek tsifteteli dance, at a slower tempo and a different key than the Oriental performances that most are familiar with today. This was the style of recording by Michalis Patrinos in Greece, circa 1930, which was circulated in the United States by the Orthophonic label; another recording was made by Patrinos in New York City in 1931 as well.

The song&#x27;s Oriental melody has been so popular for so long that many people, from Morocco to Iraq, claim it to be a folk song from their own country. In the realm of Middle Eastern music, the song is a very simple one, since it is little more than going up and down the &quot;Hijaz Kar&quot; or double harmonic scale (E–F–G♯–A–B–C–D♯). It still remains a well known Greek, Klezmer and Arab folk song.

=== Later versions ===
In 1941, Nick Roubanis, a Greek-American music instructor, released a jazz instrumental arrangement of the song, crediting himself as the composer. Since his claim was never legally challenged, he is still officially credited as the composer today worldwide, except in Greece where credit is given to either Roubanis or Patrinos. Subsequently, Chaim Tauber, Fred Wise and Milton Leeds wrote English lyrics to the song. Roubanis is also credited with fine-tuning the key and the melody, giving it the Oriental sound that it is associated with today. The song soon became an &quot;exotica&quot; standard among the light swing (lounge) bands of the day.

Harry James recorded and released &quot;&#x27;Misirlou&quot; in 1941 on Columbia 36390, and the song peaked at No. 22 on the U.S. chart.

In 1946, pianist Jan August recorded a version of the song on Diamond Records (Diamond 2009), which reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jockey charts in the U.S.

In 1951, Turkish-Jewish polyglot singer Darío Moreno recorded a version with lyrics sung in French. 
In 1962, Dick Dale rearranged the song as a solo instrumental rock guitar piece. During a performance, Dale was bet by a young fan that he could not play a song on only one string of his guitar. Dale&#x27;s father James Monsour and uncles were Lebanese-American musicians, and Dale remembered seeing his uncle play &quot;Misirlou&quot; on one string of the oud. He vastly increased the song&#x27;s tempo to make it into rock and roll. It was Dale&#x27;s surf version that introduced &quot;Misirlou&quot; to a wider audience in the U.S.

Jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi recorded a live version with his quartet at the Trident Jazz Club in Sausalito, California in December 1962. It was released the following year on &quot;Vince Guaraldi in Person&quot;, and received critical accolades from &quot;Why It Matters&quot; blogger James Stafford stating &quot;for sheer plaster-a-smile-on-your-face delight, nothing beats his take on the Mediterranean traditional song&quot;.

The Beach Boys recorded a Dale-inspired &quot;Misirlou&quot; for the 1963 album &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, solidifying &quot;Misirlou&quot; as a staple of American pop culture.

In 1972, Serbian folk singer Staniša Stošić recorded his version of the song, called &quot;Lela Vranjanka&quot; (&quot;Lela from Vranje&quot;).

=== Dance ===
In 1945, a Pittsburgh women&#x27;s musical organization asked Professor Brunhilde E. Dorsch to organize an international dance group at Duquesne University to honor America&#x27;s World War II allies. She contacted Mercine Nesotas, who taught several Greek dances, including Syrtos Haniotikos (from Crete), which she called Kritikos, but for which they had no music. Because Pittsburgh&#x27;s Greek-American community did not know Cretan music, Pat Mandros Kazalas, a music student, suggested the tune &quot;Misirlou&quot;, although slower, might fit the dance.

The dance was first performed at a program to honor America&#x27;s allies of World War II at Stephen Foster Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh on March 6, 1945. Thereafter, this new dance, which had been created by putting the Syrtos Kritikos to the slower &quot;Misirlou&quot; music, was known as Misirlou and spread among the Greek-American community, as well as among non-Greek U.S. folk-dance enthusiasts.

It has been a staple for decades of dances held at Serbian Orthodox churches across the U.S., performed as a kolo, a circle dance. The dance is also performed to instrumental versions of &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; by Manos Hadjidakis – though in the Serbian-American community, &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; was popularly enjoyed as a couple&#x27;s dance and actually sung in English. &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; was often one of only two songs performed in English at these dances, the other song being &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; (formerly &quot;Moon Over Naples&quot;) also internationally popular in its time.

The Misirlou dance also found its way into the Armenian-American community who, like the Greeks, were fond of circle dances, and occasionally adopted Greek dances. The first Armenian version of &quot;Misirlou&quot; was recorded by Reuben Sarkisian in Fresno the early 1950s. Sarkisian wrote the Armenian lyrics to &quot;Misirlou&quot; which are still sung today, however he wrote the song as &quot;Akh, Anoushes&quot; (&quot;Ah, My Sweet&quot;) while later Armenian singers would change it to &quot;Ah Anoush Yar&quot; (&quot;Ah, Sweet Lover&quot;; Yar meaning sweetheart or lover, from Turkish).

=== Legacy ===
In 1994, Dick Dale&#x27;s version of &quot;Misirlou&quot; was used on the soundtrack of the 1994 motion picture &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, prominently featured over the opening titles. 

The song was selected by the Athens 2004 Olympics Organizing Committee as one of the most influential Greek songs of all time, and was heard in venues and at the closing ceremony – performed by Anna Vissi.

In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed Dale&#x27;s version at number 89 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.

The Black Eyed Peas heavily incorporates Dale&#x27;s version of &quot;Misirlou&quot; in their 2006 single &quot;Pump It&quot; from their album &quot;Monkey Business&quot;.

The U.S. version of Kitchen Nightmares uses a version of &quot;Misirlou&quot; in its intro.

<text>Francis John Newhook (16 November 1918 – 1 December 1999) was the head of the School of Plant Pathology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. He was the first plant pathologist at the university, from 1966 (sponsored by New Zealand Forest Products) as an Associate Professor, and from 1969 a personal chair. Previously he was a scientist at the DSIR.

Newhook was born in Auckland on 16 November 1918. He was educated at Auckland Grammar School and the University of Auckland. He married (1) Agnes Marjorie Anderson (three children) and (2) pianist Janetta McStay. In World War II he was a Major in the 2nd NZEF in the Middle East and Italy.

Newhook published extensively on fungal pathogens, especially &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, and wrote over 90 scientific papers and other publications.

==Recognition==
Newhook was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of London c.1982, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1984 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. As the collector of the holotype collection, the fungus &quot;Dichomitus newhookii&quot; is named after him.

In 2004, Landcare Research named one of its Auckland laboratories the FJ Newhook Microbiology Laboratory in his honour.

<text>International Institute for Management Development (IMD) is an independent academic institute with campuses in Lausanne, Switzerland and Singapore. IMD is well known for its MBA program, which is taught in English and consistently ranked among the best in the world. In 2024, it named David Bach as its new president.

==History and mission==
IMD was formed in January 1990 through the merger of independent management education centers International Management Institute (Geneva) (IMI), established in 1946 by Alcan, and Institut pour l&#x27;Etude des Methodes de Direction de l&#x27;Entreprise (IMEDE) Lausanne established in 1957 by Nestlé. The new organization, the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), settled in Lausanne. The history of IMEDE and its merger with IMI is documented in Jean-Pierre Jeannet and Hein Schreuder (2015, chapters 2 and 4). Its industrial heritage is unusual for business schools, which are usually university-affiliated.

IMD business school solely provides executive education; it is a Swiss university institute accredited by the Swiss Accreditation Council and it consists of one integrated multidisciplinary faculty. The faculty consists of more than 50 full-time members, made up of 21 different nationalities. The current president is David Bach, who follows Jean-Francois Manzoni, Dominique Turpin, John R. Wells, Peter Lorange, and Juan Rada.

IMD focuses on training and developing general management and leadership skills.

==Education==
IMD has two main educational offerings:

* Degree programs: the MBA and the EMBA
* Executive education: open enrollment and company custom programs
* The degree programs have triple accreditation by AACSB, AMBA, and EFMD(EQUIS).

===MBA program===
The school&#x27;s MBA program is a one-year full-time program. The program runs from January through December without any break (summer is dedicated to a Company Engagement Project). Each class includes 90 participants from various countries.

Students will benefit from close contact with executives on-site given IMD has been recognized as the best business school for an open program in executive education from 2012 to 2017. Moreover, students will also enjoy several trips to further expand their knowledge and activate their network: one discovery expedition (one week in a developed country and one week in a developing country), a Europe trip and a trip to reflect on the dilemma. Finally, each student will have to participate in the International Consulting Project during the fall, where he or she will be part of a team and work as a consultant on a project designed by various companies. Starting in 2018, the MBA curriculum includes electives dedicated to practical experience in digital marketing, machine learning, and big data.

Admission to the MBA program requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent from an accredited institution, GMAT, and a minimum of three years of full-time work experience, as well as a strong command of written and spoken English and one language in addition to English. Applicants who are deemed successful in the first written stage of the application process are invited to the second stage, and an interview process called the IMD Assessment Day. The Assessment Day is a full-day event held either in IMD&#x27;s campus in Lausanne, Switzerland, or in Singapore, or in other locations. It involves a personal interview, a short presentation, a business case discussion, and an MBA class observation. The final admissions decision is communicated within 2 weeks of the Assessment Day.

Forbes has ranked IMD&#x27;s MBA #1 among one-year international MBA programs in its 2019 ranking. IMD has held top spots in the ranking since 2001. IMD has also been ranked #1 in 2017, 2013, 2011, 2007, and 2001.

===EMBA program===
The curriculum of the EMBA is different from the MBA because it targets experienced managers with at least 10 years of experience who seek to strengthen their careers without leaving their jobs. The average class size is around 55 participants of more than 40 nationalities. The program has three components: the foundations for business leadership, the advanced management concepts, and the mastery stage. Altogether the program takes over one year. It has a strong focus on leadership skills, integrated business themes, and the immediate practical application of the subject matter. The 55 selected students have an average age of 40. Supporting their growth as a leader, faculty share their knowledge, resources and contacts in discovery modules around the globe. Participants also travel to global destinations to build critical skills in entrepreneurship, innovation, impact investing, and much more, experiencing environments that will have the biggest impact on their learning and development. 

===Executive education===
Executive education is a fundamental part of the school activities.

==Ranking==
IMD&#x27;s full-time MBA has been ranked by Bloomberg and Forbes as one of the best one-year programs in Europe and internationally.

In 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 IMD was ranked first in open programs worldwide by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. The FT also places IMD at second in Custom Programs, with the school jumping up two places from fourth in 2016. IMD remained in second place in the combined custom and open program rankings, maintaining its spot from last year.

<text>The Executive Council of Manitoba (), more commonly known as the Cabinet of Manitoba, is the cabinet of the Canadian province of Manitoba. As of 2023, the current cabinet are members of the New Democratic Party, and have been since 2023.

Almost always made up of members of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, the Cabinet is similar in structure and role to the Cabinet of Canada while being smaller in size. As federal and provincial responsibilities differ, there are a number of different portfolios between the federal and provincial governments.

The Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, as representative of the King in Right of Manitoba, heads the council, and is referred to as the Governor-in-Council. Other members of the Cabinet, who advise (or minister) the vice-regal, are selected by the Premier of Manitoba and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a ministry, but this is not always the case.

<text>Douglas Winton Dye (12 July 1921 – 18 December 2005) was a New Zealand microbiologist.

==Biography==
Dye graduated with a Bachelor of Agricultural Science from Massey Agricultural College in 1944. He began work with the DSIR in 1946 and for the first 10 years of his career, worked as a pathologist on the pathogenic bacteria of crops in New Zealand. From 1956 until 1958, he studied in Edinburgh for his PhD, the subject of which was the taxonomy of &quot;Xanthomonas&quot;. It was this meticulous work, showing the absence of phenotypic diversity between specific pathogens in this genus, that led to the development of pathovar nomenclature, applied internationally to plant pathogenic bacteria today.

Subsequently, he clarified the relationships within the major bacterial groups represented by &quot;Erwinia&quot; and &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;. Dye worked on several committees connected with bacterial taxonomy, most notably the International Committee on the Systematics of Bacteria, participating in the complete revision of bacterial names contained in the Approved Lists of Names of Bacteria, and the Committee on Taxonomy of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria of the International Society for Plant Pathology, which developed the International Standards for Naming Pathovars.

From the late 1960s, as head of an expanding Bacteriology Section in Plant Diseases Division of DSIR, he maintained a day-to-day interest in wide-ranging studies of his staff. Dye&#x27;s personal culture collection, begun in 1951, evolved into today&#x27;s ICMP culture collection held at Landcare Research, Tamaki.

He retired in December 1983, and was made an Honorary Member of the New Zealand Microbiological Society the following year. The bacterial genus &quot;Dyella&quot; was named after him. The collection and bacteriology laboratory suite at Landcare in Tamaki was named after him in 2004. He attended the naming ceremony.

<doc id="942599" wikidata="Q6411334" url="?curid=942599" title="King Cobb Steelie">
<text>King Cobb Steelie is a Canadian indie rock band formed in 1991 from Guelph, Ontario, and later based in Toronto. The band&#x27;s most successful single was 1997&#x27;s &quot;Rational&quot;, from the album &quot;Junior Relaxer&quot;. Their music fuses elements of punk, grunge, funk, jazz and dance. The core of the band is singer/songwriter Kevan Byrne and bassist Kevin Lynn. A variety of other collaborators, including Sam Cino, Al Okada, Gary Dutch, Geoff Walton, Steve Clarkson, Mike Armstrong, Nathan Lawr, Don Pyle and Michelle McAdorey, have contributed to individual albums.

==History==

In 1993 the band, named for a special kind of toy marble, released its self-titled album, which fused progressive rock with dubstep sampling. In 1994 the band was signed to the EMI label, and released the followup album &quot;Project Twinkle&quot;. The album received a Juno Award nomination for Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1995.

Following &quot;Project Twinkle&quot;, the band also performed a number of improvisational shows under the pseudonym Junior Relaxer, which would become the title of their third album in 1997. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Rational&quot;, was the band&#x27;s biggest hit, and garnered the band a MuchMusic Video Award nomination for Best Video at the 1997 MMVAs.

In 1999, as Junior Relaxer, the band gave a number of performances at Rancho Relaxo in Toronto.

Percussionist Robin Easton participated as drummer 14 in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on July 7, 2007 at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York. That year King Cobb Steelie released an album, &quot;Destroy All Codes&quot;.

After several years of only occasional activity, the band played a 20th anniversary benefit show at Lee&#x27;s Palace in Toronto, Ontario on April 16, 2011 with proceeds going towards Ontario Hands &amp; Voices, an organisation dedicated to supporting families with children who are deaf or hard of hearing. In the fall of 2012, the band re-released &quot;Project Twinkle&quot; on Pheromone Recordings and performed the album live in its entirety at the Horseshoe Tavern and at Van Gogh&#x27;s Ear in Guelph as part of the Stay Out Of The Mall XI festival.

On December 12, 2013 King Cobb Steelie released &quot;Goodbye Arcadia&quot;, a four-track EP. This was their first new material in nine years. That year they performed a concert in Toronto as part of the Long Winter concert series.

In April 2022, member Mike Armstrong passed away from a cardiac event.

<doc id="942637" wikidata="Q382550" url="?curid=942637" title="Thomas Keller">
<text>Thomas Aloysius Keller (born October 14, 1955) is an American chef, restaurateur and cookbook author. He and his landmark Napa Valley restaurant, the French Laundry in Yountville, California, have won multiple awards from the James Beard Foundation, including Best California Chef in 1996 and Best Chef in America in 1997. The restaurant was a perennial winner in the annual &quot;Restaurant&quot; list of the Top 50 Restaurants of the World; the voting process has since been changed to disallow previous winners from being considered.

In 2005, he was awarded the three-star rating in the inaugural Michelin Guide for New York City for his restaurant Per Se, and in 2006, he was awarded three stars in the inaugural Michelin Guide to the San Francisco Bay Area for The French Laundry. He is the only American chef to have been awarded simultaneous three-star Michelin ratings for two different restaurants. His restaurants currently hold seven Michelin stars in total: three at Per Se, three at the French Laundry, and one at the Surf Club Restaurant.

==Early life and career==
Keller&#x27;s mother was a restaurateur who employed Thomas as help when her cook got sick. Four years after his parents divorced, the family moved east and settled in Palm Beach, Florida. In his teenage summers, he worked at the Palm Beach Yacht Club starting as a dishwasher and quickly moving up to cook, where he discovered his passion for cooking and perfection of the hollandaise sauce.

During summers, he worked as a cook in Rhode Island. One summer, he was discovered by French-born Master Chef Roland Henin and was tasked to cook staff meals at The Dunes Club. Under Henin&#x27;s study, Keller learned the fundamentals of classical French cooking. After The Dunes Club, Keller worked various cooking positions in Florida and soon became the cook at a small French restaurant called La Rive in the Hudson River valley in Catskill, New York. Thomas worked alone with the couple&#x27;s grandmother as prep cook. Given free rein, he built a smokehouse to cure meats, developed relationships with local livestock purveyors and learned to cook entrails and offal under his old mentor, Roland Henin, who would drop by on occasional weekends. After three years at La Rive, unable to buy it from the owners, he left and moved to New York and then Paris, apprenticing at various Michelin-starred restaurants.

After returning to America in 1984, he was hired as chef de cuisine at La Reserve in New York, before leaving to open Rakel in early 1987. Rakel&#x27;s refined French cuisine catered to the expensive tastes of Wall Street executives and received a two-star review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1987/03/13/restaurants&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity waned as the stock market bottomed out and at the end of the 1980s, Keller left, unwilling to compromise his style of cooking to simple bistro fare.

==The French Laundry==

Following the split with his partner at Rakel, Keller took various consultant and chef positions in New York and Los Angeles. In the spring of 1992 he came upon a restaurant in Yountville, California, founded by Sally Schmitt, in a space formerly occupied by an old French steam&lt;ref name=&quot;forbestravelguide/laundry&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; laundry.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr-A/laundries&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband Don purchased the building in 1978 and converted it into a restaurant. Keller spent nineteen months raising $1.2 million from acquaintances and investors to purchase the restaurant, then re-opened it in 1994. Over the next few years the restaurant earned numerous awards, including from the James Beard Foundation, gourmet magazines, the Mobil Guide (five stars), and the Michelin Guide (three stars).

In April 2009, Keller became engaged to longtime girlfriend and former general manager at the French Laundry, Laura Cunningham.

==Other restaurants and pursuits==
===Food and dining===
After the success of the French Laundry, Thomas and his brother, Joseph Keller (currently owner/chef of Josef&#x27;s in Las Vegas), opened Bouchon in 1998. Located down the street from the French Laundry, it serves moderately priced French bistro fare, with Bouchon Bakery opening next door a few years later (in 2006 Keller opened a branch of the bakery in the Time Warner Center in Manhattan). Keller has joked in the past that the motivation for Bouchon&#x27;s opening was to give him somewhere to eat after work at the French Laundry. On January 26, 2004, Keller opened his restaurant Bouchon in Las Vegas. On February 16, 2004, Keller&#x27;s much-anticipated Per Se restaurant opened in the Time Warner Center complex in New York under the helm of Keller&#x27;s Chef de Cuisine, Jonathan Benno. Per Se, which was designed from scratch and custom-built as part of the overall construction process, was an immediate hit on the New York restaurant scene, with reservations booked months in advance and publications including &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; giving rave reviews. The latest restaurant, &quot;ad hoc&quot;, opened in September 2006 in Yountville with a different fixed price comfort food dinner served family style every night. Originally intended to be a temporary project while Keller planned his lifelong dream restaurant for the location, serving hamburgers and wine, he decided to make ad hoc permanent and find a new location for the hamburger restaurant due to its popularity.

Prior to the opening of the French Laundry, Thomas Keller started a small olive oil company called EVO, Inc. in 1992, with his girlfriend of the time, to distribute Provençal-style olive oil and red wine vinegar. Recently, Keller started marketing a line of signature white Limoges porcelain dinnerware by Raynaud called &quot;Hommage Point&quot; (in homage to French chef and restaurateur, Fernand Point) that he helped and a collection of silver hollow ware by Christofle. He has also attached his name to a set of signature knives manufactured by MAC.

Keller is the president of the Bocuse d&#x27;Or U.S. team and was responsible for recruiting and training the 2009 candidates. The former French Laundry Chef de Cuisine Timothy Hollingsworth won the Bocuse d&#x27;Or USA semi-finals in 2008, and represented the U.S. in the world finals in January 2009 under Keller&#x27;s supervision where he placed 6th. On describing his reasons for accepting the Bocuse d&#x27;Or Team USA presidency, Keller stated, &quot;When Chef [Paul] Bocuse calls you on the phone and says he’d like you to be president of the American team, you say, ‘Oui, chef’. He&#x27;s the role model, the icon&quot;.

In 2012 he announced he was at the point of his career when it was time to step away from the kitchen. The important thing, he said, is to make sure to give to young chefs the right things, the right mentoring because &quot;if we&#x27;re not truly working to raise the standards of our profession, then we&#x27;re not really doing our job.&quot; He permanently closed his restaurant TAK Room, located in Hudson Yards, during the coronavirus pandemic. The throwback restaurant had been opened in March 2019, and had been his first New York restaurant in 15 years.

===Publishing and film===
In 1999, Thomas Keller published &quot;The French Laundry Cookbook&quot;, which he considers his definitive book on cuisine. That year it won three International Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP) awards for Cookbook of the Year, Julia Child &quot;First Cookbook&quot; Award, and Design Award. In 2004 he published &quot;The Bouchon Cookbook,&quot; although he gives most of the credit to Bouchon chef Jeffrey Cerciello. Other cookbooks that he has written or contributed are &quot;The Food Lover&#x27;s Companion to the Napa Valley&quot;, &quot;Under Pressure: Cooking Sous Vide&quot;, &quot;Ad Hoc at Home&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bouchon Bakery&quot; (2012). He provided an introduction or foreword to &quot;The Vineyard Kitchen: Menus Inspired by the Seasons&quot; by Maria Helm Sinskey, &quot;Happy in the Kitchen&quot; by Michel Richard, &quot;Indulge: 100 Perfect Desserts&quot; by Claire Clark (head pastry chef at the French Laundry), the new publication of &quot;Ma Gastronomie&quot; by Fernand Point, &quot;Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing&quot; by Micheal Ruhlman and Brian Polcyn. He is also featured in &quot;My Last Supper&quot; by Melanie Dunea.

Working on the film &quot;Spanglish&quot;, Keller designed and taught star Adam Sandler to cook what is often called &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest sandwich&quot;, as a plausible example of what a talented bachelor gourmet might cook for himself. The sandwich resembles a typical BLT, with the addition of a fried egg. In an interview with &quot;Vogue Man Arabia&quot; he described the BLT as &quot;the perfect sandwich&quot;. Keller served as a consultant for the 2007 Pixar animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, allowing the producer to intern in the French Laundry kitchen and designing a fancy layered version of ratatouille, &quot;confit byaldi&quot;, for the characters to cook. In the American version he makes a cameo appearance as a restaurant patron (the part is played by one of Keller&#x27;s mentors Guy Savoy in the French version, and Ferran Adrià in the Spanish one). Keller is frequently referenced in the restaurant workplace comedy-drama &quot;The Bear&quot;, with Keller making a special guest appearance as himself in the Season 3 episode &quot;Forever&quot;. A different character in the series portrayed by Joel McHale is very loosely based on Keller, although with exaggerated negative character traits.

Keller currently has three online cooking classes at Masterclass.com.

<doc id="942643" wikidata="Q5643" url="?curid=942643" title="Water taxi">
<text>A water taxi or a water bus is a boat used to provide public or private transport, usually, but not always, in an urban environment. Service may be scheduled with multiple stops, operating in a similar manner to a bus, or on demand to many locations, operating in a similar manner to a taxi. A boat service shuttling between two points would normally be described as a ferry rather than a water bus or taxi.

The term &quot;water taxi&quot; is usually confined to a boat operating on demand, and &quot;water bus&quot; to a boat operating on a schedule. In North American usage, the terms are roughly synonymous.

The earliest water taxi service was recorded as operating around the area that became Manchester, England.

==Locations==
Cities and other places operating water buses and/or taxis include:
On demand water taxis are also commonly found in marinas, harbours and cottage areas, providing access to boats and waterfront properties that are not directly accessible by land.

==Incidents==
On March 6, 2004, a water taxi on the Seaport Taxi service operated by the Living Classrooms Foundation capsized during a storm on the Patapsco River, near Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor. A total of five passengers died in the accident, which the National Transportation Safety Board determined was caused by insufficient stability when the small pontoon-style vessel encountered strong winds and waves. The company no longer operates water taxi vessels in Baltimore harbor.

<text>Gordon Herriot Cunningham, CBE, FRS (27 August 1892 – 18 July 1962) was the first New Zealand–based mycologist and plant pathologist. In 1936 he was appointed the first director of the DSIR Plant Diseases Division. Cunningham established the New Zealand Fungal Herbarium, and he published extensively on taxonomy of many fungal groups. He is regarded as the &#x27;Father&#x27; of New Zealand mycology.

==Biography==
In his life, he was a boxer, motorcyclist, gold prospector, farmer, horticulturist, forestry worker, and Gallipoli veteran. Following this colourful early life, &#x27;G.H. Cunn.&#x27; joined the Biological Laboratory staff at the Department of Agriculture in 1919 as a mycologist, and began a systematic survey of plant diseases in New Zealand. He also began his work classifying fungi. In 1925, he published the first New Zealand work on plant diseases, &quot;Fungus Diseases of Fruit Trees in New Zealand&quot;. When the Biological Laboratory was moved from Wellington to Palmerston North in 1928 to become the Plant Research Station, Cunningham became the head of a mycology laboratory. The Plant Research Station disbanded in 1936, and Cunningham become the director of the DSIR Plant Diseases Division.

Cunningham produced definitive monographs of New Zealand Gasteromycetes (puffballs), Polyporaceae (pore fungi), Thelephoraceae (crust fungi), and Uredinales (rust fungi).

He made major contributions to plant pathology in New Zealand, especially with therapeutics and naming of pathogens. In the 1949 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Cunningham was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services in the field of plant research and plant diseases.

In 2004, Landcare Research named the rooms hosting the New Zealand Fungal Herbarium at its Auckland site the GH Cunningham Mycology Suite in his honour.

<doc id="942677" wikidata="Q3182815" url="?curid=942677" title="John Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst">
<text>John de Vere Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst, (5 February 1895 – 30 October 1970) was a British Army officer, politician and colonial administrator. After serving in the army, the Foreign Office, and as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons, Wakehurst was appointed as the last British Governor of New South Wales, which he held from 1937 to 1946. Upon returning to Britain he was appointed Governor of Northern Ireland from 1952 to 1964. He was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1962 and died in 1970.

==Early years==
Loder was born in London in February 1895, the only son of Conservative MP Gerald Loder, the fourth son of Sir Robert Loder, 1st Baronet and member of a prominent Sussex family, and Lady Louise de Vere Beauclerk, the daughter of the 10th Duke of St Albans and personal friend of Queen Victoria, who permitted Loder to be christened in the Chapel Royal of St. James&#x27;s Palace.

Through his mother&#x27;s family, he was descended from an illegitimate royal line of King Charles II. Loder was educated at Eton College, where he excelled in history and languages, with a particular interest in drama. Although originally intending to go to Trinity College, Cambridge, with the outbreak of the First World War, Loder was instead commissioned into the 4th Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment, and later joined the Intelligence Corps, seeing service throughout the war in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine. For his services, he was Mentioned in Despatches, and left the British Army in 1919 with the rank of captain.

Loder worked as a clerk in the Foreign Office from 1919 to 1922 and then for two years at the League of Nations in Geneva. On 3 June 1920, he married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Tennant, the daughter of prominent Liberal politician and businessman, Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet. Together they had four children: three sons, Christopher, David and Robert, and a daughter, Henrietta. Indulging in his interest in Egyptology, Loder wrote his first book: &quot;The Truth about Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine.&quot; (1923).

John and Peggy Loder travelled on a world tour in 1924, including a visit to Australia. Although initially unimpressed, describing Sydney as &quot;afflicted with so much Victorian architecture of the worst kind&quot;, by the end he had warmed to the country, writing that Australia was &quot;a splendid country with splendid people&quot; possessing a &quot;democratic spirit&quot;. Returning to England, Loder was narrowly elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Leicester East in 1924, a seat he held until being defeated in the 1929 General Election. Loder then made several visits to Bolshevik Russia, writing another book entitled: &quot;Bolshevism in Perspective&quot; (1931). In 1931 he returned to the House of Commons as member for Lewes, and represented this constituency until succeeding his father on his death as the second Baron Wakehurst in 1936, who had been raised to peerage in 1934. Loder then entered the House of Lords.

==Governor of New South Wales==
The following year, Wakehurst was appointed as Governor of New South Wales to succeed Sir David Anderson, who had died in office. He was recommended by the Dominions Secretary, Malcolm MacDonald, to the Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, who promptly accepted. King George VI then formally approved and Wakehurst&#x27;s appointment was officially announced on 7 January 1937. 

Before he left, Wakehurst was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) and later a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (KStJ) in June 1937. He was to be the last non-Australian governor of the State. The Wakehursts, accompanied by their three sons (Henrietta, at school at the time, would join them three months later), arrived in Sydney, New South Wales on 8 April 1937 and the six-foot, red-haired Wakehurst was sworn in at Government House on the same day.

Wakehurst, aware of any potential criticism over his British Conservative background, arranged for their children to be schooled in Australia: Christopher Loder who attended Tudor House School, then left to attend a year at Eton College before returning to attend The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta; David Loder to Tudor House before attending Geelong Grammar School; Robert Loder attended Cranbrook School, and Henrietta Loder returned to obtain a Diploma in Social Studies at the University of Sydney.

Early on in their term, the Wakehursts engaged themselves in the typical Vice-regal duties, becoming involved in various sporting and community organisations, touring the state and fulfilling the social responsibilities required of the Vice-Regal Couple. They officiated at the celebrations for the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and at the Sesquicentenary of Australian settlement celebrations in January 1938.

In August 1939, he handled a major political crisis brought about when the former Deputy Leader of the governing United Australia Party, Eric Spooner brought down Premier Stevens in a motion of no confidence. Wakehurst successfully asked the Treasurer, Alexander Mair, to form a government. While Wakehurst was well within his rights to exercise his discretion, the Leader of the Opposition, Jack Lang, criticised him for being biased towards the government. However, on 5 September Lang was deposed by his party and replaced by the more moderate William McKell, who became Premier at the May 1941 election and got on well with Wakehurst, extending his term past 1942.

In January 1940 the Wakehursts helped fight bushfires near Moss Vale and heavily involved themselves towards the war effort following Australia&#x27;s entry into the Second World War, giving regular speeches and rallying people to contribute towards the war effort.

In 1945, the Wakehursts accompanied General Sir Thomas Blamey and his wife on a visit to troops in the South-West Pacific Area. Wakehurst&#x27;s extended appointment ended on 8 January 1946, then the longest term for a New South Wales Governor, and returned to England, marking the end of 158 years of British Governors in New South Wales.

His portrait, commissioned by the Sydney City Council and painted by Sir William Dobell in 1944, was presented to Wakehurst by the Lord Mayor of Sydney Alderman Reg Bartley and is held in Government House, Sydney.

==Later life and legacy==

Upon returning to Britain, Lord and Lady Wakehurst worked with community organisations including the Order of St John of Jerusalem, of which Wakehurst was Lord Prior from 1948 to 1969, subsequently also a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order (GCStJ), and for the English-Speaking Union. An avid theatre-lover Wakehurst was a trustee of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and a governor of the Royal Ballet. Lady Wakehurst also served on the executive committee of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. Lord Wakehurst succeeded Earl Granville as the Governor of Northern Ireland on 3 December 1952.

Wakehurst was a keen amateur filmmaker and dozens of reels of his films survive in the National Film Archive including his colour recordings of the Coronation in 1953.

In May 1962, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Wakehurst as a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG). Reappointed for a second term in 1958, Wakehurst retired from office in 1964 and died on 30 October 1970 at his home at Chelsea, London.

To commemorate their service as Viceroys of NSW, the trustees of the Royal National Park named a major road through the park as &quot;Lady Wakehurst Drive&quot;, which was dedicated by Lord Wakehurst and then Minister for Works, Joseph Cahill, at a ceremony on 14 May 1945.

On 22 March 1946, to commemorate his service as Governor a major new road through Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches was named as the &quot;Wakehurst Parkway&quot; by Premier McKell. This led to many other local locations being named for Wakehurst including the local soccer club in 1968, the Golf Club and the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Electoral district of Wakehurst. 

In January 1952 the new section of the Crown Street Women&#x27;s Hospital was named the &quot;Lady Wakehurst Annexe&quot; in their honour, which lasted until the hospital was closed in 1983. In July 1966, Belrose South Public School in Belrose on the Northern Beaches was renamed in his honour as Wakehurst Public School. In 1974, the Public Transport Commission named a ferry &quot;Lady Wakehurst&quot;.

==Family==
Lord Wakehurst married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Tennant (4 November 189919 August 1994), the daughter of prominent Liberal politician and businessman, Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet and Marguerite Agaranthe Miles, on 3 June 1920. Her great grandfather was the Scottish chemist and industrialist, Charles Tennant and her half-sister was Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith, the English socialite and wife of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. They had four children:

* Hon. Henrietta Marguerite Jean Loder (Mrs John Reader-Harris) (5 February 1922 – 16 December 1995)
* John Christopher Loder, 3rd Baron Wakehurst (23 September 1925 - 29 July 2022)
* Hon. James David Gerald Loder (24 March 1928 – 19 July 2001)
* Hon. Robert Beauclerk Loder (24 April 1934 – 22 July 2017)

Lady Wakehurst was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1965. She was also a Dame of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (DStJ) from 1960 and received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast (1957). Survived by their daughter and three sons, she died on 19 August 1994, aged 94. Their youngest son Robert became a patron of the arts, particularly in Africa.

<doc id="942680" wikidata="Q1749025" url="?curid=942680" title="Long Black Veil">
<text>&quot;Long Black Veil&quot; is a 1959 country ballad, written by Danny Dill and Marijohn Wilkin and originally recorded by Lefty Frizzell.

It is told from the point of view of a man falsely accused of murder and executed. He refuses to provide an alibi, since on the night of the murder he was having an extramarital affair with his best friend&#x27;s wife, and would rather die and take their secret to his grave than admit the truth. The chorus describes the woman&#x27;s mourning visits to his gravesite, wearing a long black veil and enduring a wailing wind.

In 2019, Frizzell&#x27;s version of &quot;Long Black Veil&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
The writers later stated that they drew on three sources for their inspiration: Red Foley&#x27;s recording of &quot;God Walks these Hills with Me&quot;, a contemporary newspaper report about the unsolved murder of a priest, and the legend of a mysterious veiled woman who regularly visited Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s grave. Dill himself called it an &quot;instant folksong&quot;.

Wilkin played piano on the original recording by Frizzell. The song was a departure from Frizzell&#x27;s previous honky tonk style and was a deliberate move toward the then-current popularity of folk-styled material and the burgeoning Nashville sound.

==Success==
Recorded in Nashville in 1959 by Lefty Frizzell and produced by Don Law, the single reached #6 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot C&amp;W Sides chart. In the process, the song became Frizzell&#x27;s best-performing single in five years.

===Cover versions===
&quot;Long Black Veil&quot; has become a standard and has been covered by a variety of artists in country, folk and rock styles. The highest charting cover version was a #26 country hit by Sammi Smith in 1974.

Johnny Cash performed the song on the first episode of &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; in 1969, duetting with Joni Mitchell. The song has also appeared on landmark albums by Johnny Cash and The Band in 1968 (see list below), and charted again in 1999 with the Dave Matthews Band, who performed the song live with Emmylou Harris at a Johnny Cash tribute concert. Early in her career, Joan Baez incorporated the song into her live repertoire, and recorded it twice (see list below).

The Band performed the song at the 1969 Woodstock Festival, and it appears on their first studio album, &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot;.

Bob Dylan performed a version of the song in 1970, as an outtake to the &quot;Self Portrait&quot;/&quot;New Morning&quot; sessions. This version was finally officially released on the &quot;Bob Dylan 1970&quot; compilation in 2020, 50 years after the recording. Dylan also played the song in a live performance in 1997.

The song appears on David Allan Coe&#x27;s 1984 compilation &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot; and on Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s &quot;Rich Kid Blues&quot;, recorded in 1971 but shelved until 1985.

Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds recorded a version for the 1986 covers album &quot;Kicking Against the Pricks&quot;.

Bruce Springsteen performed the song on his 2006 Seeger Sessions Band Tour.

The chorus is frequently sung by Bruce Hornsby during live performances of his song &quot;White Wheeled Limousine&quot;, including the version on the retrospective box set &quot;Intersections (1985-2005)&quot;.

In 1992 the British band Diesel Park West covered the song (along with other cover versions) on their series of ‘God Only Knows’ EPs that were released on the EMI/Food record label.

Mick Jagger recorded a version with The Chieftains for that group&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot;.

Mike Ness, principal songwriter and guitarist of punk rock band Social Distortion, covered the song on his 1999 debut solo album &quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot;.

Jerry Garcia, David Grisman and Tony Rice covered the song on the 2000 &quot;Pizza Tapes&quot; recordings.

It has been covered by Harry Manx, including a version on the compilation &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Blues: A Tribute to Johnny Cash&quot;, and in October 2009, by Rosanne Cash on her album &quot;The List&quot;. A version by Scottish rock band Nazareth was never released on an album, but is played at live concerts.

On the 2011 album &quot;Rancho Alto&quot; by Jason Boland &amp; the Stragglers, the song &quot;False Accuser&#x27;s Lament&quot; is a follow-up to &quot;Long Black Veil&quot;, describing a witness&#x27;s view of the events and the role that he played.

Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead performed the song several times, with a variety of musicians, in his rotating line-ups of Phil Lesh and Friends at his venue Terrapin Crossroads. Jamey Johnson has covered the song on tour. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club occasionally perform the song during their live shows. The Black Crowes have covered the song, for instance during their December 17, 2010, performance at The Fillmore in San Francisco.

Richard Hawley covered the song as a B-side to &quot;Just Like the Rain&quot;.

The Proclaimers&#x27; version is included as a bonus track on the 2001 release of their 1988 album &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;.

MJ Lenderman&#x27;s live album &quot;And the Wind (Live and Loose!)&quot; closes with his rendition of the song, which he performed with the experimental folk band Styrofoam Winos during an afterparty for Pitchfork Music Festival held at the Lincoln Hall in Chicago.

The YouTuber Edmond Sheydel published a non-commercial version described as a gothic dark romantic cover of the song, with re-imagined lyrics.

<text>Royal City was a Canadian indie rock band from Guelph.

==History==
Royal City were formed in 1999 at Jim Guthrie&#x27;s house in downtown Guelph, Ontario. The band was fronted by Aaron Riches, known in the local all ages punk scene for having booked and opening up for Fugazi, his releases on DROG Records, and for being the subject of a Robert Munsch book as a child. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;At Rush Hour the Cars&quot;, was released in 2000.

Originally called The Royal City All Stars, the band moved to Toronto after signing with Three Gut Records. At Three Gut, Royal City joined label mates Cuff the Duke and The Constantines in Toronto&#x27;s early 2000s music scene. While working with many collaborators, the core of Royal City consisted of Aaron Riches, Lonnie James, Simon Osborne and Jim Guthrie. James replaced original drummer Nathan Lawr in 2002.

During their time as a band, Royal City toured across Canada, playing in Whitehorse, Yukon, and opening for Sarah Harmer. They performed at the 2002 South by South West festival. In 2002, a then-unknown Arcade Fire opened for the band on a series of tour dates, and in 2003 the band played in Sufjan Stevens&#x27; living room as their first show in New York City.

The band was also host to a number of notable collaborations, including Leslie Feist, Sufjan Stevens, Final Fantasy, Gentleman Reg and Bob Wiseman.

After disbanding in 2004, Aaron Riches went on to study radical orthodoxy under John Milbank at the University of Nottingham. Nathan Lawr continues to release music as a solo artist and with his band the Minotaurs. Jim Guthrie has achieved considerable success scoring the video game &quot;&quot;. and the film Indie Game: The Movie. He&#x27;s also been a member of Human Highway, and has toured as part of Islands. Lonnie James went on to release two critically acclaimed solo records on Teenage USA records ( This Land is your Land, Dee-o).

In early 2009, Sufjan Stevens&#x27; Asthmatic Kitty records released &quot;Royal City&quot;, a collection of outtakes and b-sides.

<doc id="942755" wikidata="Q910264" url="?curid=942755" title="Febreze">
<text>Febreze is an American brand of household odor eliminators manufactured by Procter &amp; Gamble. It is sold in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

First introduced in test markets in March 1996, the fabric refresher product has been sold in the United States since June 1998, and the line has since branched out to include air fresheners (Air Effects), plug-in oil (Noticeables), scented disks (Scentstories), odor-eliminating candles, and automotive air fresheners.

The name &quot;Febreze&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;fabric&quot; and &quot;breeze&quot;. In many non-English speaking countries, the products are sold as Ambi Pur.

== Ingredients ==

The active ingredient in several Febreze products is hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD). The molecule traps and binds volatilized hydrocarbons within its structural ring, retaining malodorous molecules, which reduces their volatility and thus the perception of their scent. The active ingredient is produced from corn cobs. The use of cyclodextrin as a sprayable odor absorber was patented by Procter &amp; Gamble.

The products include additional ingredients such as emulsifiers, preservatives, and perfumes. Benzisothiazolinone is a preservative included in some of the products.

== Lines ==

There are many types of Febreze branded products. For example, the main Febreze products are air freshener sprays, which are claimed to have a disinfectant effect. There are specialized ones for odor from pets, for cars, and for fabric. Some are aromatic and others are odorless.

In other countries, there are Febreze products for house dust and toilet facilities.

==Marketing==
The product was initially marketed as a way to get rid of unpleasant smells. It sold poorly until P&amp;G realised that people become accustomed to smells in their own homes, and stop noticing them even when they are overpowering (like the smell of several cats in a single household). The marketing then switched to linking it to pleasant smells and good cleaning habits instead, which resulted in a massive increase in sales. Only after the product became well established in the marketplace did the marketing go back to emphasising odour elimination properties as well.

==Animal safety==
Febreze fabric freshener products are considered safe for use in households with pets. However, the package labeling indicates that the product is considered not safe around birds, and results from testing with other animals are not indicated.

<text>The Downtown Manhattan Heliport (Downtown Manhattan/Wall St. Heliport) is a helicopter landing platform at Pier 6, on the East River, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City.

The heliport was built by the Port of New York Authority in 1960 on a pier formerly used as a general cargo terminal and was reconstructed from 1983 to 1987. The Port Authority operated the facility until 2008, after which operation of the city-owned heliport was taken over by Saker Aviation. It was the first heliport in the United States to receive Federal Aviation Administration certification for scheduled passenger helicopter service, the first public heliport with a semi-automatic fire protection foam system, and the first heliport to use a barge for aircraft parking. It is currently the only heliport in New York City that accommodates sightseeing flights.

== History ==
=== Opening and early years ===
In the mid-1950s, the Port of New York Authority (PA) prepared a transportation master plan that proposed the development of six new heliports in the metropolitan area, including one at the southern tip of Manhattan near The Battery or Wall Street. The PA opened the West 30th Street Heliport in 1956 (one of the locations identified in the master plan) and New York Airways began operating helicopter shuttle service between that heliport and area airports, but passenger demand was much lower than projected and thought to be a result of competition by other forms of ground transportation. It was believed that a helicopter landing pad in Lower Manhattan would attract more passenger demand, which led to the PA to study the feasibility of a new heliport. The Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association also recommended the establishment of a heliport as part of the redevelopment of old piers on the East River and the New York City Marine and Aviation Department allocated space along the waterfront to the development of a heliport by the PA.

Plans for the new heliport and a 37-year lease of the site to the PA were approved by the New York City Board of Estimate on May 27, 1960. Built by the PA at a cost of $230,000, the original facility included a helicopter landing pad, a parking and loading area for helicopters, a one-story terminal building, and parking lot for autos. The Downtown Manhattan Heliport opened on December 8, 1960.

The same day the new heliport opened, New York Airways began operating flights to LaGuardia Airport (LGA), Newark Airport (EWR) and New York International Airport (JFK). Scheduled service to the airports was temporarily suspended in December 1969 due to the high costs of operating Boeing Vertol 107s and resumed in May 1971 with the introduction of Sikorsky S-61s to the airline&#x27;s fleet; service to Morristown Airport in New Jersey was also added at this time. New York Airways&#x27; helicopter service at the Wall Street Heliport was suspended in February 1977 with the reopening of the heliport on the roof of the Pan Am Building. The airline stopped operating in Manhattan after an accident atop the Pan Am Building in May 1977 resulted in five deaths. The airline did not return to the Wall Street Heliport because the vertical takeoffs required by the landing pad&#x27;s configuration reduced the loads that could be carried by helicopters and they could not carry enough passengers to break even. When the airline resumed operations in Lower Manhattan in April 1978, it did so at a temporary heliport built on landfill in Battery Park City.

In April 1971, Island Helicopters, Inc. began providing scheduled commuter service between the Wall Street Heliport and Roosevelt Field Industrial Park on Long Island. The flights operated for three years until service was suspended in April 1974.

The original heliport was constructed on a wooden pier originally built in 1888 as a general cargo terminal, and by the late 1970s and early 1980s deterioration of the piles supporting the structure led to segments of the pier being forced out and portions of the helicopter parking area to be closed off. A visit by United States president Jimmy Carter in November 1978 was diverted from the Wall Street Heliport to the West 30th Street Heliport due to safety concerns by the Secret Service. The Wall Street Heliport was eventually closed due to structural issues on September 16, 1983 and flights were diverted to a temporary heliport that had been used by the PA on landfill in Battery Park City.

=== Reconstruction ===
The cost of reconstructing the heliport was estimated to be nearly $7 million. Coincidentally, in 1983 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched its &quot;National Prototype Heliport Demonstration and Development Program&quot;, a project to illustrate the usefulness and viability of developing full-service heliports in the United States for eventual all-weather operations. The Wall Street Heliport, which was renamed the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, was one of four heliports selected by the FAA to be part of the program. The old pier was demolished and replaced by a new concrete structure. Although the PA&#x27;s lease with the city covered an area of approximately and allowed for significant expansion of the heliport&#x27;s operational area, the replacement pier was built to the same dimensions as the old pier and a barge was added to provide parking for helicopters (considered to be an anchored floating structure), which avoided the need for the preparation of a lengthy environmental assessment.

As part of the project, tests were made using a Microwave Landing System (MLS) at the Battery Park City Heliport and at a pier near Wall Street. Plans to install a permanent MLS were abandoned when the site in Red Hook, Brooklyn on which the transmitter was to be located was put up for sale by the PA. A semi-automatic fire protection foam system was installed that provided full coverage of the pier and could be remotely operated from the terminal; it was the first public heliport to include such a system. The PA entered into a new 20-year lease with the city for the heliport site on March 1, 1986. The diversion of flights to the Battery Park City Heliport concluded in September 1987 and the reconstructed Downtown Manhattan Heliport was dedicated on October 27, 1987. The overall cost of the reconstruction project was $13 million, of which $6 million was paid for by the federal government as part of the FAA&#x27;s &quot;National Prototype Heliport Demonstration and Development Program&quot; and $3 million was spent by the PA to ensure that the new heliport would be completed in time before the lease of the temporary heliport at Battery Park City ran out.

After the new facility opened, the PA experienced a problem with seagulls dropping clams onto the heliport to break open the shells and feared that the birds could get caught in helicopter rotors and bring aircraft down or the contents of the clam shells on surfaces could cause helicopters&#x27; landing gear to skid or passengers to slip and fall. To address the issue, the PA employed a technique that had been successfully used by the United States Coast Guard at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, using stencils to paint patterns of flying seagulls on the surface to keep the birds away.

From December 1989 to March 1990, Trump Air provided scheduled service to LGA using Sikorsky S-61s to provide connections for passengers on Trump Shuttle flights. In 1990, the Downtown Manhattan Heliport became the first heliport in the United States to receive FAA certification under Federal Aviation Regulations Part 139 for scheduled passenger helicopter service.

National Helicopter Corp. started operating sightseeing flights at the heliport in 1997 after the company had been evicted from the city-owned East 34th Street Heliport over unpaid rent. This move was estimated to add about 50 daily takeoffs and landings on weekdays to the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. The PA was unable to restrict National Helicopter Corp. from using the facility since federal funds had been used to build the heliport and for this same reason sightseeing flights could not be banned until 2008.
In March 2006, US Helicopter resumed scheduled passenger service to airports with hourly flights to JFK. Service to EWR was added in December 2006. With the addition of a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint, passengers checked baggage and underwent security screening at the heliport and disembarked at the airside zone of the terminals of partner airlines, bypassing the need to check luggage or go through security at the airport if their flight was departing from the same terminal. The Downtown Manhattan Heliport was the first heliport in the United States to be &quot;federalized&quot; by the TSA. The flights operated until September 2009 when US Helicopter ceased all service due to financial difficulties.

=== Change to private operator ===
The PA&#x27;s lease on the heliport site expired in August 2007 and was not renewed. The agency continued to operate the facility while the city sought out a new operator for the facility. Prior to the selection of a new fixed-base operator for the heliport, the city performed noise studies to determine how much new traffic the facility could handle, accommodating flights diverted from the West 30th Street Heliport. The new operator was also required to implement a refueling system available for helicopters using the facility; previously the heliport did not have any fuel services.

City officials selected FirstFlight to take over operations at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport and the company began operating the facility on November 1, 2008. The change in the heliport&#x27;s operator resulted in a five-month suspension of US Helicopter&#x27;s scheduled flights from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport to EWR and JFK because FirstFlight did obtain approval from TSA for a passenger security screening plan and then demanded higher rent from US Helicopter after a security plan was approved. US Helicopter service resumed in March 2009 after city officials helped to negotiate an agreement between FirstFlight and US Helicopter. FirstFlight subsequently changed its name to Saker Aviation.
When sightseeing flights were banned from the West 30th Street Heliport on April 1, 2010, the Downtown Manhattan Heliport was left as the only heliport in New York City that could accommodate sightseeing flights. In 2010, the downtown heliport handled at total of 43,386 flights, of which 41,540 were sightseeing-related. Sightseeing flights that had been operating from the West 30th Street Heliport shifted to the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, which prompted complaints about the noise and pollution generated by tourist flights from residents in Manhattan and Brooklyn, visitors to the Brooklyn Bridge Park, and students attending school on Governors Island, with some groups calling for a complete ban on all tourist flights. Traffic at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport increased to 58,021 total flights in 2014; the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) estimated that over 56,000 of these were sightseeing trips.

In February 2016, an agreement between the city and helicopter tour operators was reached to cut the number of sightseeing flights in half by January 1, 2017 (compared to 2015 baseline levels), restrict sightseeing flights to a maximum of 300 a day on Saturdays, and eliminate all sightseeing flights on Sundays. As a result of the agreement, the Downtown Manhattan Heliport is now capped at accommodating a maximum of 29,651 tourist flights per year.

To protect Lower Manhattan from future flooding associated with coastal storms and projected sea level rise, NYCEDC and the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Climate Resiliency commissioned the preparation of a master plan for climate resilience in the Financial District and Seaport areas. The plan was released in 2021 and included strategies to rebuild the East River waterfront from The Battery to the Brooklyn Bridge such as the addition of a floodwall. The master plan projected that the existing deck of the Downtown Manhattan Heliport would be flooded on a monthly basis by the 2050s and proposed for a replacement heliport to be built at a higher elevation near its existing site with access the pier for emergency and service vehicles provided via a flood gate. 

In November 2023, the Downtown Manhattan Heliport was the site of the first piloted demonstration flights of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft from an urban heliport, which were operated by Joby Aviation and Volocopter. That same month, NYCEDC issued a request for proposal (RFP) seeking a heliport operator which would be encouraged to incentivize the use of eVTOLs after FAA certification of this type of aircraft and develop a plan to install the infrastructure needed to accommodate eVTOLs. The RFP also included a requirement to support the development of a marine micro-distribution facility at the site, which would receive waterborne freight deliveries and facilitate last-mile deliveries by greener forms of transportation, such as cargo bikes. In November 2024, NYCEDC announced that Downtown Skyport LLC, a joint venture between Skyports Infrastructure (operator of the London Heliport) and Groupe ADP, was the winner of the RFP. The new contract is anticipated to take effect in February 2025.

==Operations==

Much of the heliport&#x27;s traffic is generated by Wall Street and the lower Manhattan financial district; top business executives and time-sensitive document deliveries often use the heliport. The heliport is the normal landing spot for the President of the United States on visits to New York. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg frequently used the heliport to fly between Bloomberg L.P. headquarters and Johns Hopkins University when he was chairman of both institutions.

The Downtown Manhattan Heliport is a public heliport operated by NYCEDC with charter service to Newark Liberty International Airport, Teterboro Airport, Morristown Municipal Airport, and other New York–area airports. Public sightseeing and VIP flights are also common.

In the year ending December 30, 2003, the airport had 10,002 aircraft operations, an average of 27 per day: 90% general aviation and 10% military.

==Facilities==

The heliport covers at an elevation of . It has one helipad, H1, concrete that can accommodate aircraft weighing up to .

The heliport&#x27;s facilities are located on a concrete pier and a barge, the &quot;Alice G. Neumann&quot;, which is anchored perpendicularly to the north side of the pier. The helipad is located at the far end of the pier, which also contains a parking lot for autos and a , two-story soundproof concrete terminal building that includes a waiting room and pilot&#x27;s lounge, with administrative offices and a flight observation deck located on the second floor.

A total of 13 helicopter parking spaces are currently provided at the heliport, 10 of which are located on the barge and 3 of which are located on the pier. While the helipad at the end of the pier serves as the designated Touch-down and Lift-off (TLOF) area, the 13 spaces on the barge and pier are also used as hybrid takeoff/landing and parking spots. The spots on the pier can accommodate a maximum helicopter rotor blade diameter of and the spots on the barge can accommodate a maximum rotor blade diameter of , except for one spot that is designed for a maximum rotor blade diameter of . The Downtown Manhattan Heliport was the first heliport to use a barge for aircraft parking.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On June 14, 2005, a Bell 206 Long Ranger on a sightseeing flight crashed into the East River shortly after takeoff. The pilot and six passengers, one of which was critically injured, were rescued by police boats. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of the accident was a result of &quot;the pilot&#x27;s inadequate preflight planning, which resulted in an attempted takeoff with an overweight helicopter.&quot;
* On December 13, 2021, a Bell 429 operated by the New York Police Department experienced ground resonance while landing and the pilot slammed the aircraft into the ground to avoid hitting other people and another helicopter in the vicinity of the landing pad. The helicopter was substantially damaged and the co-pilot was injured.

<text>Chermside is a suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The suburb is situated by road north of the Brisbane CBD. It is home to a large Westfield shopping centre. In the , Chermside had a population of 11,426 people.

== Geography ==
Chermside is a key destination along Queensland Transport&#x27;s future Northern Busway, and home to Westfield Chermside, the second largest Westfield shopping centre in Australia, with a three-storey Myer and a 16 screen cinema complex.

== History ==
The Chermside area was first settled by Europeans in the late 19th century. The first plot of land was sold on 23 May 1866, and the population has progressively increased since with a significant increase with the post-war residential development.

When the Gympie goldrush started in 1867, many travellers heading north would run into trouble at a creek in present-day Chermside. Because of this waterway, Chermside was first known as Downfall Creek.

In November 1868, Cobb &amp; Co. stagecoaches began to travel through the area on the way to the goldfields at Gympie.
A United Methodist Free church opened on Sunday 11 August 1878 on the corner of Gympie Road and Banfield Street, (then Church Street, approx ). In 1926 a more central site was purchased on the south-east corner of Gympie Road and Hamilton Road and the church building was relocated to the new site and renovated. It was replaced by a brick church which opened on 30 September 1950. It became part of the Uniting Church in 1977. This brick church was demolished in 2004, probably because the current Chermside-Kedron Community Church (a Uniting Church) in Chermside on the north-western corner of Gympie Road and Rode Road had opened on 23 September 2001.

Downfall Creek State School opened on 9 July 1900. In 1903, it was renamed Chermside State School. It closed in December 1996. It was on the north-western corner of the intersection of Gympie Road and Rode Road ().

In 1904, the district&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Chermside&quot; after the Governor of Queensland, Sir Herbert Chermside.

Regular Anglican services commenced circa 1906 in the public hall (School of Arts) on the corner of Gympie Road and Hall Street. In January 1913 land was purchased in Hamilton Road to build an Anglican church. A stump-capping ceremony was held on St James&#x27; Day 25 July 1914. The first service was held on 11 October 1914. The official dedication of All Saints Anglican Church by Archbishop St Clair Donaldson was held on 15 November 1914. The foundation stone of the present church building was laid by Archbishop Reginald Halse on Sunday 11 December 1960. The church was extended in 1996.

Chermside has had a library since 1909. Since 1951 it has been a branch of the Brisbane City Council Library service and had a major refurbishment in 2017.

In December 1925, &quot;Rainey&#x27;s Hill Top Park&quot; made up of 99 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by Thonton&#x27;s &amp; Pearce, Auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states that this estate is &quot;close to tram, motor bus, water and electric light&quot;.

&quot;The Dawn&quot; picture theatre first opened on 3 November 1928 (showing &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;). It closed on 9 August 2005 (with &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;). It was at 708 Gympie Road (), now the site of the North Brisbane Eye Centre. It was the last single screen cinema in Brisbane.

The Sanctuary in the Wheller Gardens retirement village, named for Harold M. Wheller, was dedicated on 5 March 1940 by Reverend Wilfred Leonard Slater, the President of the Methodist Conference.

During World War II, a diverse range of volunteers, soldiers, and camps were at Chermside, such as U.S. Army units, including a number of African American soldiers. A Kitty Hawk airplane on a training flight crashed there in 1943, killing the pilot and instructor.

Brisbane&#x27;s tramway network finally reached the suburb on 29 March 1947, and Chermside remained the northernmost point on the system until the line to Chermside was closed on 2 December 1968. The tram line along Gympie Road was separated from other traffic (this is commonly called &quot;reserved track&quot;), which resulted in fast travel times along this portion of the route. Another feature of the Chermside tram line were the rose gardens which bordered the reserved track portion of the line.
Westfield Chermside first opened on 30 May 1957 as &quot;The Chermside Drive-in Shopping Centre&quot; with an &quot;Allan &amp; Stark&#x27;s&quot; department store and a small arcade of a dozen shops, before becoming a Myer department store. It was the first drive-in shopping centre in Australia. It was the first drive-in shopping centre in Australia. It is now the largest single level shopping centre in Australia, with a 3-storey Myer, as well as a 16-screen Birch, Carrol and Coyle megaplex. It is also home to Brisbane&#x27;s first Apple Store.

St Thomas&#x27; Anglican Church in Chermside East (now Wavell Heights) was dedicated on 13 October 1957 by Archbishhop Reginald Halse. Its closure on 21 December 1990 was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning. It was deconsecrated was authorised by Archbishop Peter Hollingworth.

The Prince Charles Hospital (a public hospital) was opened in 1959.

The Brisbane Chest Hospital was opened in 1954 for the treatment of tuberculosis. As tuberculosis declined, it was renamed The Chermside Hospital in 1961 to reflect its more general healthcare role. Prince Charles visited Brisbane in 1974 and the hospital was renamed The Prince Charles Hospital in his honour.

St Laurence&#x27;s Anglican Church in Chermside West was dedicated on 26 February 1966 by Archbishop Phillip Strong. It has since closed.

The early 1970s saw the opening of Queensland&#x27;s first Kmart store in Chermside, which was situated next to a Coles supermarket. Both of these stores closed in the mid-1990s and have been replaced with a Woolworths supermarket and specialty stores. Both Kmart and Coles have been relocated in Westfield Chermside.

Craigslea State School opened 24 January 1972 and the neighbouring Craigslea State High School opened on 28 January 1975. Both are now within Chermside West.

In 1975 the area known as Chermside West was established as a separate suburb.

Prince Charles Hospital Special School closed on 30 December 1983.

The Burnie Brae Centre (also known as Chermside Senior Citizens Centre) opened in 1984, from funds raised by the Rotary Club of Chermside. It was named for the Burnie Brae Homestead that had originally occupied the site.

Holy Spirit Northside Private Hospital opened 30 July 2001; it was operated by the Sisters of Charity and the Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters. In September 2019 it was renamed St Vincent&#x27;s Private Hospital Northside.

<doc id="942827" wikidata="Q5526600" url="?curid=942827" title="Gasparilla Pirate Festival">
<text>The Gasparilla Pirate Festival (often simply referred to as Gasparilla ) is a large parade and a host of related community events held in Tampa, Florida, United States, most years since 1904. The centerpiece of the festivities is the Parade of Pirates, which is framed as a friendly invasion by the crew of the mythical pirate José Gaspar (also known as Gasparilla), a popular figure in Florida folklore. The Parade of Pirates is often referred to as &quot;the&quot; Gasparilla Parade by locals, and the date of the event is known as Gasparilla Day.

The Parade of Pirates and some related events are organized by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla (YMKG), a local club modeled after the krewes of Mardi Gras in New Orleans. On Gasparilla Day, members of YMKG play the parts of Gaspar and his crew by donning pirate regalia and sailing across Tampa Bay aboard the &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot;, a replica pirate ship which is actually a steel barge converted to look like a large West Indiaman. Accompanied by hundreds of private boats and firing a continuous barrage of loud mini-cannons, Gaspar&#x27;s motley band make their way to the Tampa Convention Center, where they meet the mayor and demand the key to the city in a playful ceremony. YMKG then stages a victory parade down Bayshore Boulevard featuring over 100 floats, marching bands and other live entertainers, and dozens of additional krewes and community organizations. Participants on floats and on foot throw beads, coins, and other trinkets to a crowd of spectators that usually numbers about 300,000, making the Parade of Pirates one of the largest annual parades in the United States.

Gasparilla began as a surprise land-based pirate &quot;invasion&quot; by a few civic leaders during the city&#x27;s May Day festival in 1904. Over the next decade, a pirate-themed parade and festival was sometimes staged as an add-on to other community events, with the highlight of the early period being the first seaborne invasion in 1911. The Gasparilla Festival became a stand-alone event in 1913, and with the exception of hiatuses during world wars, it has been celebrated almost every year since. The parade has been scheduled for late January or early February for much of its existence, and since 2005, it has taken place on the last Saturday in January. The route of the Gasparilla Parade has traditionally wound along the waterfront into downtown Tampa, and since 2011, it has ended along the Tampa Riverwalk, where festivities continue into the nighttime hours.

Over time, the formerly one-day event has evolved into a Gasparilla season which runs from approximately the beginning of the year until mid-March. Two other major parades during this time are the Gasparilla Children&#x27;s Parade, which runs a shorter route on Bayshore Boulevard one week before the main parade, and the Sant&#x27; Yago Illuminated Knight Parade, which is organized by the Krewe of the Knights of Sant&#x27; Yago in the historic neighborhood of Ybor City two weeks after the main parade. Besides the three large parades, the city hosts many other community events during this time including the Gasparilla Film Festival, the Gasparilla Festival of the Arts, the Gasparilla Distance Classic, the Gasparilla Music Festival, the Gasparilla Bowl college football game, and a broad slate of other events that varies from year to year. Most of these events are not organized or officially sanctioned by the city or YMKG, which have only limited legal control of the Gasparilla name. Taken together, the events of Tampa&#x27;s Gasparilla Season have an estimated local economic impact of over $40 million.

==Description==
=== Parade of Pirates ===

The theme and focal point of Gasparilla is a theatrical invasion by mythical pirate José Gaspar and his crew, who are portrayed by members of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla (YMKG), an organization created for this purpose in 1904. Around noon on Gasparilla Day, members of YMKG set sail across Tampa Bay from the Tampa Yacht Club near Ballast Point Park on the &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot;, a replica pirate ship built from a flat-bottomed steel barge. Firing a near-continuous barrage of loud mini-cannons and accompanied by hundreds of private boats, the ship makes its way between Davis Island and Harbour Island to the Garrison Channel, where it moors along the Riverwalk behind the Tampa Convention Center. The krewe disembarks into a crowd of revelers and the pirate captain demands that the mayor hand over the key to the city in a playful ceremony which has had different outcomes in different years. Whether or not the mayor actually &quot;surrenders&quot;, the pirates stage a victory parade along Bayshore Boulevard.

During the parade, members of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla along with about fifty other krewes throw beads, coins, and various souvenirs to the throngs from over 100 floats, most of them pirate-themed. In addition to the krewes, high school and university marching bands and drill teams often participate, and many local businesses and organizations build and enter their own elaborate floats from which they also throw trinkets to the crowd. The parade has been broadcast live on local television for decades: WFLA-TV has provided coverage since 1955, and WTVT-TV also covered the parade from 1955 to 1980.

==== Krewes ====
Many of the events of Tampa&#x27;s Gasparilla season are organized by social and charitable organizations known as krewes, which were originally modeled on the Mardi Gras krewes of New Orleans. Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla came together informally in 1904 to stage a mock invasion during a community festival. The organization has continued to stage the Gasparilla Parade ever since and has evolved into an exclusive social club and registered non-profit. As the festivities have become larger and more complicated over the years, YMKG has accepted corporate sponsorships to defray costs and has employed local firm EventFest to plan the parade with the city. Each year, YMKG members elect a King and Queen of Gasparilla to preside over various club galas and events during the season. Besides the Gasparilla parades and holding its own private events, YMKG raises money for various charitable causes and annually endows several college scholarships through its community fund.

The Krewe of Gasparilla was Tampa&#x27;s only officially recognized Gasparilla krewe until the co-ed Krewe of Venus was organized in 1965. This was followed by the Ybor City–based Krewe of the Knights of Sant&#x27; Yago in 1972 and the Tampa Rough Riders in 1978. The first all-female Ye Loyal Krewe of Grace O&#x27;Malley joined in 1992. More krewes were established after YMKG opened up participation in the parade in the 1990s. Krewes are centered around various ethnic, cultural, and historical themes or favorite charity causes, and much like the krewes of Mardi Gras, members often spend a great deal of money on elaborate costumes, beads, and floats.

Currently, over fifty krewes march in the Gasparilla Parade of Pirates, with smaller krewes participating on a rotating basis due to the limited number of available slots. Many of the same krewes—large and small—also participate in the Gasparilla Children&#x27;s Parade and the Sant&#x27; Yago Knight Parade.

==== Floats ====

Parade floats have long been a part of Gasparilla festivities. The earliest examples were decorated wagons or flatbeds pulled by horses or trucks, or simply a decorated truck by itself. More involved designs became more common after World War I, and by the 1950s, several multi-segmented floats with elaborate decorations rolled down Bayshore Boulevard on Gasparilla Day.

As of 2024, 115 floats participated in the Parade of Pirates; 14 used by YMKG and the rest by other krewes, local businesses, civic organizations, and sports teams. Some remain relatively simple in design, but a trend in recent years has been to build more elaborate floats with lights, moving animatronic elements, water or smoke effects, and hidden wet bars and bathrooms for riders, with some costing as much as $100,000 to design and construct. Outside of Gasparilla season, YMKG&#x27;s active and retired floats along with the floats of several other krewes and organizations are stored in the &quot;float barn&quot;, a warehouse procured by YMKG for that purpose.

==== Throws and cannons====
Parade participants on floats and on foot have traditionally tossed souvenirs as they make their way along the route, but the specific items have changed over time. Plastic beads like those at New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities are by far the most prevalent item, with varieties ranging from simple single-color necklaces to intricate and expensive designs, most of which are purchased by krewe members themselves. So many beads are thrown that in recent years, the city has organized post-parade volunteer cleanup efforts which annually collect thousands of pounds of plastic from the parade route and nearby Tampa Bay.

Though very popular now, beads were rarely seen at Gasparilla Parades before the mid-1980s. The two most common throws before that were plastic or metal commemorative coins produced annually by various krewes and spent gun cartridges. For decades, many members of YMKG walked the parade route armed with six-shooters or other handguns loaded with blanks which they frequently fired in the air. The empty shells were tossed aside as the pirate reloaded, sending children scrambling for the unique souvenirs. This tradition was restricted in the interest of safety in 1992 and ended entirely several years later. While pirates on foot are no longer allowed to use firearms during the parade, trained members of YMKG still fire loud mini-cannons from several specialized floats and during the cross-bay voyage of the &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot;.

=== Prelude and departure ===
Several semi-theatrical events take place before and after the Gasparilla Day pirate invasion:
*About two weeks before the Parade of Pirates, a U.S. Navy ship volunteers to be attacked by several small boats of the &quot;Ybor City Navy&quot; armed with stale loaves of Cuban bread and water hoses. The U.S. Navy returns fire with their water hoses and (on occasion) rotten vegetables, but they are eventually forced to surrender to the Alcalde of Ybor City, who, as the story goes, has been hired by José Gaspar to help clear resistance to his impending pirate attack. The event was staged on an annual basis beginning in the early 1950s but was discontinued after the September 11, 2001 attacks. It has taken place intermittently since then, with the museum ship SS &quot;American Victory&quot; standing in for the U.S. Navy.
*A few days before the Parade of Pirates, members of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla in full pirate regalia &quot;kidnap&quot; the mayor from city hall and transport them to a downtown park before assembled local media and onlookers to demand the city&#x27;s surrender. The mayor playfully refuses, and the pirates warn that José Gaspar will arrive with an invasion force on the following Saturday to steal the key to the city. 
*The Outbound Voyage is the culminating event of the Gasparilla season which was revived in 2008 after being discontinued in 1964. During this ceremony, the pirates return the key of the city to the mayor, climb aboard the &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot;, and retrace their route from Gasparilla Day by sailing away across Tampa Bay while festivities continue along the Tampa Riverwalk. The Outbound Voyage usually takes place on the first Saturday in March.

=== Children&#x27;s Parade ===
The Children&#x27;s Gasparilla Extravaganza is held on the Saturday prior to the main parade, currently the second-to-last Saturday in January. It is billed as a family-friendly event, as unlike the Parade of Pirates, alcohol is not allowed along the parade route, which runs along Bayshore Boulevard and is about half as long as the main Gasparilla Parade. The Children&#x27;s Parade was first held in 1947 and was a simple affair that mostly featured schools and children&#x27;s organizations pulling homemade floats for a few blocks in downtown Tampa, though it slowly increased in complexity and popularity over the decades. It moved to its current route in 2002 and usually draws about 100,000 attendees.

The Children&#x27;s Parade now features many of the same krewes and several of the same professional floats featured in the main parade. Children of krewe members don costumes and ride on the floats tossing beads and trinkets to the crowd, and local youth organizations such as sports and dance teams also participate, usually performing along the route. Various activities and events for children are held in and around downtown Tampa in the hours before the Children&#x27;s Parade, including the Preschooler&#x27;s Stroll, which is a short, informal parade of small children riding pirate-themed wagons, strollers, bicycles, and scooters reminiscent of the earliest versions of the children&#x27;s parade. To add noise to the festivities, the pirate ship &quot;Jose Gasparilla&quot; usually sails nearby firing its mini-cannons during the parade, and the day ends with a fireworks display over Tampa Bay.

=== Sant&#x27; Yago Illuminated Knight Parade ===

The Sant&#x27; Yago Illuminated Knight Parade (sometimes referred to as the Gasparilla night parade) has been organized since 1974 by the Krewe of the Knights of Sant&#x27; Yago. It is held in the historical neighborhood of Ybor City on a Saturday night, usually two weeks after the Parade of Pirates in early to mid-February. The Knight Parade features a similar mix of participants as the Parade of Pirates with the twist that most of the floats are brightly illuminated since the event begins after dark. Though it once had the reputation of being the most adult-oriented parade of Tampa&#x27;s Gasparilla season, the city has tried to reduce public drunkenness and other unruly behavior in recent years and has promoted the parade as a family-friendly event, with some success.

=== Additional events of Gasparilla Season ===
Besides the three main parades and the many galas, parties, and fundraisers hosted by individual krewes, Tampa has long hosted a variety of other Gasparilla-related events from approximately January through March. Large-scale events during Gasparilla Season include the Gasparilla Festival of the Arts (established 1970), the Tampa Rough Rider&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade (first held in 1977), the Gasparilla Distance Classic road race (established 1978), the Gasparilla Film Festival (established 2006), the Gasparilla Music Festival (established 2013), and the Gasparilla Bowl college football game (renamed in 2018) along with a variety of other events that change from year to year.

One of the first related events was the Gasparilla Open, a PGA Tour stop sponsored by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla from 1932 to 1935. The 1935 edition had the largest prize purse on that year&#x27;s PGA Tour ($4000), but with the deepening of the Great Depression, the tournament was discontinued thereafter. It returned in 1956 as the Gasparilla Invitational Tournament, an amateur competition which has been held annually ever since.

==== Use of the name &quot;Gasparilla&quot; ====

A wide variety of local businesses, organizations, and smaller events ranging from restaurants to beauty pageants to classic car shows and food festivals use the names &quot;Gaspar&quot; or &quot;Gasparilla&quot;; according to the Florida Department of State, over 100 entities have registered related names. Other local organizations have taken on the Gasparilla / pirate theme, most prominently the National Football League&#x27;s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who first took the field in 1976 and installed a replica pirate ship in the stands of their home field at Raymond James Stadium.

Most of the organizations, events, and businesses who use &quot;Gaspar&quot; or &quot;Gasparilla&quot; are not affiliated with Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla or the City of Tampa, neither of which owns the monikers. While some feel that the widespread use of the name constitutes a co-branding which promotes all similarly named organizations and Tampa in general, others believe that overuse could dilute the meaning and significance of the festival, and that the potential failures or missteps of one event or organization might reflect poorly on all the others. In 2019, YMKG began an effort to legally trademark the name Gasparilla to &quot;protect&quot; it for use by &quot;appropriate community events&quot;, drawing complaints and counterclaims from others who have used the name or own the trademark for other, more narrow uses. In 2020, the issue was considered by the United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.

=== Economic impact ===
Crowd size for the Parade of Pirates is typically about 300,000, making it one of the largest annual parades in the United States. Most of the expense is paid by YMKG through memberships dues, vendor fees, tickets for premium seating areas, and corporate sponsorships, with the city redeploying police and other staff and resources to limit its financial contribution.

According to a 2004 study, the main parade alone had a local economic impact of $22 million and the combined events brought in over $40 million, with officials estimating that the impact has increased in the years since. To promote the area&#x27;s many springtime events, Visit Tampa Bay, the local tourist bureau, has run multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns across the United States, Canada, and Europe encouraging visitors to experience &quot;Gasparilla Season&quot;.

== History ==
=== Legend of José Gaspar ===

The theme of Gasparilla was inspired by the legend of the pirate José Gaspar, who supposedly operated off the west coast of Spanish Florida from the 1780s through the 1820s. Different versions of the story say that he was either a Spanish nobleman and advisor to King Charles III of Spain, who was exiled after a romantic scandal in court, a traitorous admiral of the Spanish Royal Navy, who stole a ship and fled when his treachery was revealed, or an ambitious young officer in the Spanish navy who was driven to mutiny by a tyrannically cruel captain. Whatever his origins, the legends agree that Gaspar fled to the virtually uninhabited southwestern coast of Spanish Florida in the 1780s and established his &quot;pirate kingdom&quot; on Gasparilla Island in Charlotte Harbor, south of Tampa Bay. Gaspar is said to have taken many ships and held many female hostages for ransom while preying on ships in the Gulf of Mexico from Louisiana to the Spanish main aboard his flagship, the &quot;Floriblanca&quot;. His exploits came to a sudden end in 1821 when, to avoid being captured by the U.S. Navy pirate hunting schooner the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, he wrapped himself in anchor chains and threw himself overboard while shouting, &quot;Gasparilla dies by his own hand, not the enemy&#x27;s!&quot;

Despite this colorful history, there is no evidence that a pirate named &quot;Gaspar&quot; or &quot;Gasparilla&quot; ever roamed the Florida coast. Archives in Spain make no mention of Gaspar as a member of the Spanish court or an officer in the Spanish navy; the U.S. Navy has no documentation indicating that any of its vessels ever encountered a pirate named Gaspar or a ship named &quot;Floriblanca&quot;, and neither Gaspar nor anyone claiming to be a member of his crew are mentioned in the records of hundreds of piracy trials from the era, which was well after the Golden Age of Piracy. Also, despite the fact that the supposed location of Gaspar&#x27;s &quot;regal base&quot; at Gasparilla Island has been developed into the resort town of Boca Grande, no artifacts or other physical evidence of the hideout, his ship, or his lost treasure has ever been found in southwest Florida despite years of searching by amateur and professional treasure-seekers.

The first written account of José Gaspar appeared in the early 1900s as part of an advertising brochure for the Gasparilla Inn in the newly established town of Boca Grande on Gasparilla Island. The brochure was produced and widely distributed by the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway, which built the resort at the end of its rail line. Besides promotional material and contact information for the Gasparilla Inn, the brochure prominently featured the &quot;Story of Jose Gasparilla&quot;, the &quot;last of the Buccaneers&quot; who it said had terrorized the Gulf of Mexico for almost 40 years. Among its many dubious claims, the short biography said that the nickname &quot;Gasparilla&quot; means &quot;Gaspar the outlaw&quot; in Spanish when it is actually a diminutive form meaning &quot;little Gaspar&quot;; it claimed that Gasparilla Island was named for the pirate when the name actually appears on Spanish and English maps from well before his supposed arrival; and it claimed that the &quot;bleached bones&quot; of Gaspar&#x27;s victims along with many old coins had been discovered in local &quot;Indian mounds&quot; when no such find has ever been documented. The brochure also claimed that the bulk of Gaspar&#x27;s vast treasure cache &quot;still lies unmoved&quot; somewhere in the vicinity of Boca Grande.

The brochure was penned by publicist Pat Lemoyne, who combined and embellished regional tall tales attributed to well-known and recently deceased local fishing guide &quot;Panther John&quot; Gomez to create the legend of the pirate Gaspar. Years later, Lemoyne gave a local history lecture in which he admitted that he had written the Gasparilla story &quot;in a style that tourists like to hear&quot; but that it was &quot;without a true fact in it.&quot;

In 1923, author Francis Bradlee obtained a copy of the Gasparilla Inn brochure and, assuming it was factual, included Gaspar in a book he was writing about piracy in the West Indies. This error led to José Gaspar being mentioned in several additional non-fiction books about piracy and Florida history, causing ongoing confusion as to the authenticity of the legend. However, though many versions of Gaspar&#x27;s adventures have been told in various forms over the years—including pulp adventure novels, tourist guides, and the official history of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla—all have their basis in the fictional tale first printed in an advertisement for the Gasparilla Inn.

=== Parade origins ===

The first Gasparilla parade was held in May 1904, after &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; society editor Louise Frances Dodge and Tampa&#x27;s director of customs George Hardee decided to combine elements of New Orleans Mardi Gras with the legend of the local pirate to promote and enliven Tampa&#x27;s May Day celebration. The first occurrence consisted of several dozen local businessmen disguising themselves as pirates, riding horses through town to simulate a surprise pirate invasion, and encouraging startled observers to follow them to the May Day festival. The second Gasparilla the following year was not a surprise, as every automobile owner in town was invited to join the mounted pirates in the parade. The pirate-themed festival was not held again until 1910, when it was revived as part of a community celebration marking the opening of the Panama Canal. In 1913, a Gasparilla Carnival that included a pirate parade and weekend festival was organized as an independent event, as it has remained ever since.

==== Pirate ship ====

The first several mock pirate invasions were land-based, with the backstory depicting the pirate ship &quot;Octopus&quot; anchored offshore. The first shipborne invasion came in 1911, when a merchant vessel was borrowed, decorated, and temporarily rechristened the &quot;Jose Gaspar&quot; for the day. A series of borrowed ships were used until the 1930s, when Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla bought an old merchant sloop and repurposed it as the &quot;Jose Gasparilla&quot;, which they used for about twenty years. The old wooden ship was in serious need of repairs and renovation by the early 1950s, so with financial assistance from the city of Tampa and the local chamber of commerce, YMKG commissioned a $100,000 replacement. The &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot; debuted during Gasparilla&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration in 1954 and has been used ever since.

Though designed to resemble an 18th-century West Indiaman, the &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot; is actually a , steel barge to which tall masts, a bowsprit, and other decorative elements have been added. Unlike earlier Gasparilla ships, the current pirate vessel has neither operable sails nor an engine, so on Gasparilla Day, it is guided through the flotilla of hundreds of private boats and watercraft by three tugboats under the direction of experienced harbor pilots. The &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot; has crossed Tampa Bay to lead every invasion since its launching except in 1971, when bad weather and rough seas canceled the flotilla, though not the parade.

For over half a century, various Gasparilla pirate ships would sail about half a mile up the Hillsborough River to Plant Park on the grounds of the University of Tampa, where members of YMKG would disembark for the parade. The construction of the Tampa Crosstown Expressway in 1976 ended that tradition, as the masts of the &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot; do not fit under the highway where it bridges the river near its mouth. Since 1992, the ship has made its way into Garrison Channel on Gasparilla Day to dock along the Tampa Riverwalk behind the Tampa Convention Center, where the pirate crew disembarks among thousands of revelers. Outside of Gasparilla season, the &quot;Jose Gasparilla II&quot; can usually be found moored near the northern end of Bayshore Boulevard within sight of downtown.

=== Location and dates ===
==== Parade route ====

At least a portion of the Gasparilla Parade of Pirates has traversed Bayshore Boulevard near downtown almost since its inception. For several decades, the parade route ended at Plant Field where the Florida State Fair was taking place, drawing more attendees to the simultaneous events. The fair moved to much larger grounds east of Tampa in 1976, but the parade route has usually remained the same, traveling north up Bayshore Boulevard and ending in or near downtown, approximately in total. Since 2011, the parade route has concluded at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park along the Tampa Riverwalk, where festivities continue into the evening.

Though their exact route varies slightly from year to year, the route of the Gasparilla Children&#x27;s Parade is about half the length of the main parade route and runs along Bayshore Boulevard, while the main leg of the Krewe of San&#x27;Yago Illuminated Knight Parade runs down 7th Avenue in Ybor City.

==== Schedule ====

The Gasparilla parade was held in conjunction with various other events in its early years, so its timing varied when it took place at all. The first mock invasion was held on May 4, 1904, and pirate-themed community festivities were held on dates ranging from February to November prior to World War I. The parade and related events were canceled during the involvement of the United States in the war, and when the festivities resumed in 1920, they were regularly scheduled for mid-February to coincide with the Florida State Fair. The Parade of Pirates went on another hiatus from 1942 through 1946 during World War II. When it returned in 1947, it was set for a Monday in mid-February, a tradition which lasted for almost four decades. Gasparilla Day became an official holiday in Hillsborough County during that period, with local schools and government offices closed for the festivities. In 1988, the Parade of Pirates was moved to the first Saturday in February so that out-of-towners could more easily take part. Since 2005, the parade has been held on the last Saturday in January except in 2021, when all major events of the Gasparilla Season were canceled due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the scheduling of the Parade of Pirates shifted over the years, the dates of the other two large parades of the season have generally shifted as well, with the Children&#x27;s Parade held one week before and the Krewe of San&#x27;Yago Illuminated Knight Parade held two weeks after the main Gasparilla Parade.

=== YMKG integration / Super Bowl controversy ===

====Background====
The Parade of Pirates and related festivities have faced various criticisms over their long history, from complaints about unruly crowds and public drunkenness to observations that the tradition of local elites pretending to be a rapacious pirate crew plundering the city could be seen as problematic. Other criticism had its roots in the earliest iterations of the parade and the original organization behind the festival, and these critiques led to a controversy which gained national attention in the early 1990s.

Though Tampa was home to one of the largest and most prosperous Hispanic communities in the American South in the early 20th century, it was strictly racially segregated like the rest of the Deep South. Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla was established by Tampa&#x27;s business and civic elite during the depths of the Jim Crow era, and the private and somewhat secretive organization remained exclusively white and male even after most public segregation had been rolled back during the Civil Rights era.

The parade itself made small steps towards inclusion over the years. Female relatives of YMKG members formed the Krewe of Venus in 1966 and were allowed to participate in the Gasparilla Parade the following year. Leading members of Tampa&#x27;s Latin community formed the Krewe of the Knights of Sant&#x27; Yago in 1972 and organized their own parade in Ybor City beginning in 1974. However, though they could participate as spectators, African-Americans and others among Tampa&#x27;s diverse population remained excluded from YMKG and direct participation.

By the 1980s, local minority organizations were publicly pointing out that exclusion from YMKG symbolized their continued exclusion from Tampa&#x27;s top social and economic circles, as membership largely overlapped that other local organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and key yacht and country clubs. An invitation to join YMKG did not only allow the invitee to dress like a pirate for the parade; it was a sign that they had &quot;arrived in the community&quot;. As former Tampa mayor Bob Buckhorn later reflected, &quot;You had this huge... public debate about the role of the Krewe of Gasparilla, but the larger issue was making sure that everyone had a seat at the table, particularly African Americans.&quot;

====1991 cancelation &amp; replacement====
This simmering issue grew into a heated controversy in 1990. Tampa and YMKG had agreed to stage the 1991 Parade of Pirates a week earlier than usual to coincide with Super Bowl XXV, which was to be played in Tampa Stadium in January. As planning commenced in 1990, local chapters of the NAACP and the Urban League made use of the media&#x27;s focus on the internationally broadcast event to highlight YMKG&#x27;s segregated membership, and the city and the National Football League pressured the Krewe to admit its first African-American members.

While claiming that it was not a racist organization and was open to accepting Black members, YMKG argued in September 1990 that it was &quot;too late&quot; to expand its membership before the 1991 parade and canceled Parade of Pirates instead. The city of Tampa hastily put together a replacement parade called &quot;Bamboleo&quot;, which was billed as a &quot;multicultural festival&quot; and did not have a pirate theme. Rainy weather helped to dampen the crowds for the event, which some observers considered a &quot;flop&quot; whiile others hailed it as a step toward a more inclusive local community.

Later in 1991, YMKG admitted two Black members and agreed to allow additional krewes to join the parade, and the Parade of Pirates returned in 1992 with an expanded participant list that better reflected the community&#x27;s population.

====2001 &quot;Supersized&quot; Gasparilla====
When Tampa hosted Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, the parade moved to the Saturday before the game as planned a decade before, and an integrated Krewe of Gasparilla was joined by over thirty other krewes before a record crowd of 750,000. Though &quot;Supersized Gasparilla&quot; was well received and was seen as a sign of the community&#x27;s social progress, the city has opted not to repeat the schedule change when hosting subsequent Super Bowls due to the serious challenges posed by large crowds and snarled traffic across downtown and South Tampa.

====Later developments====
The number of krewes and other participating civic organizations has continued to grow in recent years, dampening controversies over inclusion. Due to practical concerns, participation in the Parade of Pirates is limited to fifty krewes per year, with smaller krewes taking turns on a rotating basis.

<text>Trudeauism refers to the liberal political ideology associated with former Liberal Party of Canada leader and Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeauism involves social liberal/liberal-socialist, economic nationalist, Canadian nationalist, and centralist policies. Social justice is also an important principle of Trudeauism, with the ideology envisioning a just society.

It is concerned with historical disenfranchisement for cultural and linguistic minorities in Canada, such as Francophones, and advocates of bilingualism and multiculturalism in Canada, though it opposes distinct society status for Quebec as advocated by some Canadian federalists. However, Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s policies on First Nations affairs included the White Paper that controversially advocated the end of economic and political autonomy of First Nations within Canada that had been granted for centuries. The initiative failed and was later removed from the Trudeau government&#x27;s agenda.

==Contrast with Laurier liberalism==
Trudeauism, in contrast with the liberalism advocated by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, places higher emphasis on equality and social justice, while Laurier liberalism emphasizes individualism and classical liberalism. Trudeauism also involves a more centralized federal government, resulting in policies like the National Energy Program. On the other hand, Laurier liberalism involves a more decentralized form of federalism.

<text>Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) was an American multinational corporation that provided information technology (IT) services and professional services. On April 3, 2017, it merged with the Enterprise Services line of business of HP Enterprise (formerly Electronic Data Systems) to create DXC Technology.

==History==
CSC was founded in April 1959 in Los Angeles, California, by Roy Nutt and Fletcher Jones. CSC initially provided programming tools such as assembler and compiler software.

In the 1960s, CSC provided software programming services to major computer manufacturers like IBM and Honeywell and secured their first contracts for the U.S. public sector with NASA (among others).

By 1963, CSC became the largest software company in the United States and the first software company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange. By the end of 1968, CSC was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and had operations in Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and the Netherlands.

In 1967, CSC set up Computicket Corp. to compete in the fledgling electronic ticket market competing with Ticketron but lost $13 million and discontinued the service in 1970.

In the 1970s and 1980s, CSC expanded globally winning large contracts for the finance and defense industries and through acquisitions in Europe and Australia.

In 2000, CSC founded a joint-venture called Innovative Banking Solutions AG in Wiesbaden, Germany, to market their newly developed SAP solution for mortgage companies.

Since its beginnings in 1959, company headquarters had been in California. On March 29, 2008, the corporate headquarters of the company were relocated from El Segundo, California, to Falls Church, Virginia.
CSC had been a Fortune 500 Company since 1995, coming in at 162 in the 2012 rankings.

In fiscal 2013, CSC acquired ServiceMesh (cloud management) for $282M, Infochimps (a big data platform) for $27M, 42Six (analytics for national intelligence) for $35 million, iSOFT (application solutions) for cash and debt, and AppLabs (application testing) for $171M.

In May 2015, CSC announced plans to split the public sector business from its commercial and international business. In August, it was announced that CSC&#x27;s Government Service business would merge with SRA International to form a new company — CSRA—at the end of November 2015.

In July 2015, CSC and HCL Technologies announced the signing of a joint venture agreement to form a banking software and services company, Celeriti FinTech.

In September 2015, CSC closed the acquisition of Fixnetix, a provider of front-office managed trading solutions in capital markets. CSC also acquired Fruition Partners, a provider of technology-enabled solutions for the service-management sector during the month.

In November 2015, CSC agreed to acquire the shares of UXC, an IT services company based in Australia in a deal valued at ().

In December 2015, business technology and services provider, Xchanging, agreed to be purchased by CSC.

In February 2016, CSC announced it was moving its headquarters to Tysons in Fairfax County, Virginia.

On April 3, 2017, it merged with HPE Enterprise Services to create DXC Technology.

==Business==
CSC once ranked among the leading IT service providers in the world. Geographically, CSC had major operations throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

The company operated in three broad service lines or sectors until the 2015 divestment of NPS, its public sector:

* North American Public Sector (NPS): Since 1961, CSC had been one of the major IT service providers for the U.S. federal government. CSC provided services to the United States Department of Defense, law enforcement and intelligence agencies (FBI, CIA, Homeland Security), aeronautics and aerospace agencies (NASA). In 2012, U.S. federal contracts accounted for 36% of CSC total revenue. 
* Managed Services 
* Business Solutions and Services

The company made several acquisitions, including DynCorp in 2003 and Covansys Corporation in 2007.

==Awards and recognition==
* In September 2012, CSC was ranked 8th in &quot;Software Magazine&quot;’s Software 500 ranking of the world’s largest software and service providers.

==Criticism==
* In June 2013, Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a Select committee of the British House of Commons, described CSC as a &quot;rotten company providing a hopeless system&quot; with reference to their multibillion-pound contract to deliver the National Programme for IT Lorenzo contract. 
* In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized CSC for spending on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–10, instead getting in tax rebates, despite making a profit of .
* In February 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a fraud investigation into CSC&#x27;s accounting practices in Denmark and Australian business. CSC&#x27;s CFO Mike Mancuso confirmed that accounting errors and intentional misconduct by certain personnel in Australia prompted SEC regulators to turn their gaze to Australia. Mancuso also stated that the alleged misconduct includes in both intentional accounting irregularities and unintentional accounting errors. The SEC accused the former CEO Mike Laphen of fraud and clawed back $4,35 million 
* The company was accused of breaching human rights by arranging several illegal rendition flights for the CIA between 2003 and 2006, which also led to criticism of shareholders of the company, including the governments of Norway and Britain.
* The company engaged in a number of activities that resulted in legal actions against it. These are:
*# Its so-called &quot;WorldBridge Service&quot; (Visa Services), which processed and issued millions of visa applications to enter Britain, did not involve British authorities.
*# In 1998, CSC was the prime contractor hired by the Internal Revenue Service to modernize its tax-filing system. They told the IRS it would meet a January 2006 deadline, but failed to do so, leaving the IRS with no system capable of detecting fraud. Its failure to meet the delivery deadline for developing an automated refund fraud detection system cost the IRS between and .

== Geography ==

Bald Hills is a largely residential suburb. It is mostly surrounded by bushland, but in the last few years some of the bush areas have been cleared to make way for new residential areas. It also borders onto the Bald Hills Flats – a large flood plain on the western side of the suburb that is used for cattle grazing. The South Pine River flows through the flood plain and forms the western border of the suburb. The South Pine River converges with the North Pine River and the combined flow, Pine River, forms the northern border. Along the banks of Pine River within Bald Hills is a large environmental park called the Tinchi Tamba Wetlands Reserve. The Pine River empties into Bramble Bay, between Redcliffe and Brighton.

The Bruce Highway goes between Bald Hills to Woree in Cairns and is long.The most prominent structure is the Bald Hills Radiator, the ABC&#x27;s 198 metre tall AM radio transmission tower located on the eastern side of the suburb.

== History ==

The suburb is named after the two small hills in the South Pine River Valley floor.

The first land sales in the area occurred in 1857. Land sales around the Bald Hills railway station were advertised in April 1886. At the time the journey from Brisbane was described as &quot;after travelling across the Downfall and Cabbage Tree Creeks, the traveller arrives at a long stretch of road, at the extremity of which rises a lofty knoll, round the brow of which the road winds, when the Bald Hills are reached&quot;.

In 1888, the &quot;Bald Hills Railway Station Estate&quot; made up of 500 allotments was advertised to be auctioned by Arthur Martin &amp; Co., auctioneers. A map advertising the auction indicates that the land is situated near Bald Hills railway station and special trains will be provided on the day of the sale.

<doc id="942926" wikidata="Q6469941" url="?curid=942926" title="Lady Annabel Goldsmith">
<text>Lady Annabel Goldsmith (&#x27;Vane-Tempest-Stewart, formerlyBirley; born 11 June 1934) is an English socialite and the eponym for a London nightclub of the late 20th century, Annabel&#x27;s. She was first married for two decades to entrepreneur Mark Birley, the creator of Annabel&#x27;s. Annabel&#x27;s was her husband&#x27;s inaugural members-only Mayfair club.

A London society hostess, during the 1960s and the 1970s, she gained notoriety in gossip columns for her extramarital affair with Anglo-French financier James Goldsmith, member of the wealthy banking Goldschmidt family, who later became her second husband. A descendant and heiress of the Marquess of Londonderry, her primary occupation has been as a mother of six children whose births span 25 years. She is also an author, and the founder of the Democracy Movement, a Eurosceptic political advocacy group. Among her children are the journalist and film producer Jemima Goldsmith and Zac Goldsmith, the former Conservative MP for Richmond Park.

== Background and image ==
The second of three children, Lady Annabel was born in London into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family with its roots in Ulster and County Durham. Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart was born the daughter of Robin, Viscount Castlereagh, who later became The 8th Marquess of Londonderry, and Romaine Combe, who was the daughter of Major Boyce Combe, from Surrey.

She became Lady Annabel as a young girl in February 1949, when her father became marquess on the death of his father, the controversial Ulster Unionist politician The 7th Marquess of Londonderry. Her mother died of cancer in 1951, but the illness was kept a secret by her parents. She later said, &quot;Cancer was such a taboo then – Mummy didn&#x27;t even tell her sisters.&quot; Subsequently, her father became a chronic alcoholic and died from liver failure at the age of 52 on 17 October 1955. &quot;My father was a really wonderful man but after my mother died, we couldn&#x27;t talk to him as we had done before. He couldn&#x27;t face life without her and he turned into Jekyll and Hyde almost overnight&quot;, she explained.

She was named after her mother&#x27;s favourite song, &quot;Miss Annabel Lee&quot;, and grew up as a country child at her family&#x27;s former estates of Mount Stewart, Wynyard Park, and Londonderry House. She was educated at Southover Manor School in Sussex and Cuffy&#x27;s Tutorial College in Oxford. Awkward and shy in her youth, she was an avid reader, equestrian, and a Girl Guide for the Bullfinch Patrol. She transformed from an unconfident and self-described &quot;skinny, gauche young girl&quot; into a socialite during the 1950s and 1960s. Queen Elizabeth II attended her coming-out ball in 1952. As part of the London social circle, she is known for her sense of humour, down-to-earth personality, and love of children and dogs. She was never a drinker. She chain-smoked until the age of 40.

== Family ==
Lady Annabel is the mother of Rupert, Robin and India Jane Birley and Jemima, Zac and Ben Goldsmith. She has referred to herself as &quot;an incredible mother, rather a good mistress, but not a very good wife&quot;. With six children and five miscarriages, her primary vocation was motherhood, which prompted her to say: &quot;I&#x27;m not judgmental about women who work, but I was so besotted with my children I never wanted them out of my sight.&quot; She was also considered a mother figure by her nieces, Ladies Cosima and Sophia Vane-Tempest-Stewart, and Diana, Princess of Wales. As the wife and ex-wife of two unfaithful men, she explained her marriage philosophy to the &quot;Times&quot; in 1987: &quot;I can never understand the wives who really mind, the wives who set such store by fidelity. How extraordinary, and how mad they are. Because, surely, if the man goes out and he comes back, it&#x27;s not actually doing any harm.&quot;

=== Annabel&#x27;s and the Birleys ===
On 10 March 1954, at the age of 19, she married businessman Mark Birley at the Caxton Hall register office in London. Birley famously paid tribute to her by naming in her honour his renowned nightclub, Annabel&#x27;s, which opened on 4 June 1963 and was run by Birley for more than forty years. During the 1960s, Lady Annabel was a constant presence at Annabel&#x27;s, known as one of the grandest nightclubs of the sixties and seventies, where she entertained guests ranging from Ted and Robert F. Kennedy to Frank Sinatra, Prince Charles, Richard Nixon, and Muhammad Ali. &quot;I used to be there every night, even when I had three small children to take to school the next day. It was like a second home to me&quot;, she recalled.

She raised her three children with Birley at Pelham cottage. Her eldest son Rupert, who was born on 20 August 1955, studied at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1986, he disappeared off the coast of Togo in West Africa, where he was presumed drowned. &quot;There really is nothing worse than losing a child – and there is something special about your first-born&quot;, she said, adding that, &quot;Because I was so young when Rupert was born ... we were more like good friends than mother and son.&quot; Her second son Robin (b. 19 February 1958) is a businessman, whose face was disfigured as a child when he was mauled by a tigress at John Aspinall&#x27;s private zoo. Having let him go near the pregnant tigress, Lady Annabel said, &quot;It was my own fault. I was, am, angry with myself.&quot; Her first daughter India Jane (born 14 January 1961), the granddaughter of society portrait painter Sir Oswald Birley, is an artist.

The Birleys separated in 1972 and later divorced in 1975 after the birth of her second child with James Goldsmith. &quot;Our breakup was because of Mark&#x27;s infidelities, not because I fell in love with Jimmy&quot;, she told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writer Maureen Orth after Birley&#x27;s death. Revealing that Birley had numerous other girlfriends from the beginning of their relationship, she added: &quot;I think he was absolutely incapable of being faithful. He was a serial adulterer. Like a butterfly, he had to seduce every woman.&quot;

Despite their divorce, the two remained best friends and soulmates, talking to each other every day and holidaying together until Birley&#x27;s death in August 2007. Birley said they were &quot;the true loves of each other&#x27;s lives&quot;.

=== Goldsmith affair and remarriage ===
In 1964, she embarked on a decade-long extramarital affair with Sir James Goldsmith, a member of the Goldsmith family. Though both she and Goldsmith, who was then married to his second wife Ginette Lery, believed that the affair would be a passing fling, it soon gained her notoriety in London&#x27;s gossip columns as a modern mistress. She was eventually coaxed into having his children by their friend John Aspinall, who was also a former friend of Mark Birley who introduced her to Goldsmith.

While still legally married to Birley, she gave birth to Jemima (b. 30 January 1974) and Zac (b. 20 January 1975). Her last child Ben Goldsmith was born on 28 October 1980 at 46, after two consecutive miscarriages. The children were raised in Ormeley Lodge in Ham, London. The half-Jewish and half-Catholic Goldsmith was an occasional presence in their lives as he divided time between three families. In 1978, Goldsmith and Lady Annabel married solely to legitimise their children.

Goldsmith moved to New York with his new mistress Laure Boulay de la Meurthe, daughter of Alfred, Comte Boulay de la Meurthe, in 1981 and spent the last years of his life mostly in France and Mexico. He became known for quoting Sacha Guitry&#x27;s words, &quot;If you marry your mistress you create a job vacancy.&quot; Often wrongly credited with the quote, Goldsmith admitted, &quot;I quoted him at dinner, and it was pinned on me. I don&#x27;t mind. ... I just don&#x27;t want to claim what&#x27;s not mine.&quot; In 1997, she and her youngest three children inherited a portion of Goldsmith&#x27;s wealth, estimated varyingly at £1.6 and $1.7–$2.4 billion.

=== Present ===
She resides in Ormeley Lodge, a Georgian mansion on the edge of Richmond Park, with two Grand Basset Griffon Vendéens, Daisy and Lily, and three Norfolk terriers, Barney, Boris and Bindy. In 2003, she remarked on her children&#x27;s varied marital patterns by observing, &quot;All my children with James marry young and breed, and my children with Mark do the opposite.&quot;

Lady Annabel has fourteen grandchildren. She spends part of each year at her organic farm in the hills above Benahavís and has a 1930s holiday home by the seaside in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. Asked about her regrets in life, in 2004, she confessed wishing that she had, instead of marrying twice, been &quot;a one-man woman&quot;.

== Activism and philanthropy ==
Lady Annabel is president of the Richmond Park branch of the Royal Society of St George, a patriotic outreach society aimed to motivate youth. She is a donor to and supporter of the Countryside Alliance, an environmental charity called The Soil Association, and African Solutions to African Problems (ASAP), which works to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on orphans and vulnerable children in South Africa. As an animal lover, she is also one of the patrons of the Dogs Trust and a supporter of the Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home, along with being vice-president of the British Show Pony Society.
She had early interest in journalism but declined a low-level position at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; at age 19 to get married instead. She has since contributed opinion editorials to national newspapers &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, among others.

Inspired by Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy&#x27;s radio address during the Hungarian Revolution, in November 1956, she and Mark Birley volunteered with the Save the Children organisation in Vienna. She organised charitable donations and travelled daily to look after refugees who crossed the Austrian border into the frontier town of Andau. In May 1997, she campaigned with her second husband in Putney, the constituency unsuccessfully contested by Goldsmith for his Referendum Party. She continued to support her husband&#x27;s ideas, like the single currency referendum, after his death as part of the Referendum Movement, which was headed by Paul Sykes and Lord McAlpine of West Green and of which she became honorary president.

In January 1999, she launched the Democracy Movement, of which she was president and her son Robin was chairman until 2004. Starting from 12 January 2001, the organisation launched a £500,000 advertising and leafleting campaign to expose the parliamentary votes of pro-Brussels candidates in 120 &quot;target&quot; seats before the May general elections. The Democracy Movement released two million pamphlets carrying gloom-ridden headlines about a European state and published full page local newspaper advertisements in the constituencies of 70 Labour MPs, 35 Liberal Democrats, six Conservatives and three Scottish National Party candidates. Describing the campaign as an effort &quot;in memory of Jimmy&quot;, she said:
On 17 December 2007, she testified at the inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, where she denied the perception that the princess was in love with and/or pregnant by Dodi Fayed. &quot;She was in love with Hasnat Khan. I felt she was still on the rebound from Hasnat Khan... She might have been having a wonderful time with him, I&#x27;m sure, but I thought her remark that she needed marriage like a rash meant that she was not serious about it&quot;, Lady Annabel told the jury.

== Books ==
In March 2004, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson published her memoirs &quot;Annabel: An Unconventional Life&quot;, which recounted her life from a pre-World War II aristocratic childhood and her glamorous social circle of the 1960s to her current status as an active grandmother. The book was serialised in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. On the promotion tour, she gave numerous interviews and participated in a discussion with historian Andrew Roberts at the annual Cheltenham Festival of Literature in April 2004. A &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; profile observed that, &quot;What seems to have kept Annabel afloat is her almost naive ability to let bygones be bygones&quot;. Claudia FitzHerbert&#x27;s review in the same newspaper denounced the autobiography as &quot;woodenly hilarious&quot; and &quot;disappointingly vague&quot;.

David Chapman, reviewing the book for the Newsquest Media Group Newspapers, concluded, &quot;This is a decidedly funny memoir that includes the scrapes and japes of nob culture.&quot; Lorne Jackson of the &quot;Sunday Mercury&quot; was totally dismissive of what he called &quot;a dull memoir&quot;, stating: &quot;This could have all been explained in one page, possibly two if the type was particularly large.&quot; &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; commented that, &quot;Annabel comes across as a decent woman ... but her writing is flat, with a few too many clumsy constructions, and her story lacks drama, even when terrible things happen to her.&quot; Biographer Selina Hastings called it &quot;a well-ordered, decently written book,&quot; while the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; wrote, &quot;Goldsmith herself comes across as fun and warm, a good sport, if sometimes strangely submissive and a little overfond of her own breasts.&quot; &quot;Annabel&quot; became a No.1 London best-seller for non-fiction. Nationally, the memoirs reached the top ten non-fiction best-sellers in England, fluctuating from No. 7 to No. 4 and then No. 6.

She followed her autobiography, two years later in September 2006, by ghost-writing her pet dog Copper&#x27;s autobiography in the name of &quot;Copper: A Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;. Her daughter India Jane illustrated the book. Copper was originally bought by the Goldsmiths as a reward to their daughter Jemima for passing her Common Entrance Examination, but he remained in Lady Annabel&#x27;s care for most of his life and had an adventurous time in Richmond. &quot;Amid tough competition, he was probably the greatest character I ever knew&quot;, she told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. The mongrel, who died in 1998, was famed for travelling by bus, chasing joggers and visiting a Richmond pub, the Dysart Arms.

Her literary efforts originated after the experience, according to her, of a life-defining moment on 29 December 2000. She, her son Benjamin, daughter Jemima and her two sons, plus her niece Lady Cosima Somerset and her two children were travelling to Kenya, when a passenger on their British Airways plane stormed into the cockpit and tried to seize the controls. The autopilot on the flight to Nairobi became temporarily disengaged and the jumbo was knocked off course, abruptly diving and plunging below. &quot;Nobody on that plane thought, &#x27;am I going to die?&#x27;&quot; she later recalled. &quot;They all thought, &#x27;we are going to die&#x27;. It was horrible, horrible.&quot; This near-death incident has been credited by Lady Annabel as the catalyst for her writings. &quot;I had always thought that I would write a book&quot;, she claimed, &quot;but writing my memoirs didn&#x27;t really come into my head until after that flight.&quot; In the introduction to &quot;Annabel&quot;, she wrote:
 Her third book, &quot;No Invitation Required: The Pelham Cottage Years&quot;, was released in November 2009. The book is composed of &quot;intimate and perceptive essays [and] pen-portraits of some of the extraordinary figures that entered the Birley and Goldsmith circles – among them, Lord Lambton, Patrick Plunket, John Aspinall, Geoffrey Keating, Lord Lucan, Dominic Elwes and Claus von Bülow.&quot;

<text>Alta Moda was a Canadian funk rock band formed in 1979 in Toronto. It originally consisted of singer Molly Johnson and guitarist Norman Orenstein. Drummer Steven Gelineau and bassist Etric Lyons were added in 1982 and 1983 respectively.

After performing for several years in Toronto and releasing the promotional single &quot;Train&quot; in 1986, the band signed to CBS Records and released their debut album, &quot;Alta Moda&quot;, in 1987. 

The album received mixed reviews, with some critics saying it sounded too much like funk or disco; the band even faced some assertions that they were &quot;too black&quot; for the Canadian market. The album spawned the single &quot;Julian&quot;, but the song was only a modest hit, peaking at #53 in the &quot;RPM&quot; Hot 100 chart the week of January 30, 1988. The album&#x27;s other singles, &quot;Notown (In Particular)&quot; and &quot;Cool Love&quot;, did not chart. 

Alta Moda contributed a non-album track, &quot;American Chaser&quot;, to the soundtrack of the 1986 television film &quot;Popeye Doyle&quot;.

The band declined a Juno Award nomination in the R&amp;B category for &quot;Julian&quot;, because they felt it was a miscategorization of the song.

Although Alta Moda had originally signed a six-album deal with CBS, they were dropped from the label after the album&#x27;s poor sales. The band continued to perform live, on the lookout for another deal. Orenstein wrote and produced material for other artists, and Johnson performed jazz and blues with a backing band which later became Big Sugar.

Johnson and Orenstein signed a new deal with IRS Records in 1990, but changed the band&#x27;s name to Infidels by the time of their 1991 album.

<text>The Faded Sun trilogy is a series of science fiction novels by American writer C.J. Cherryh and set in her Alliance–Union universe. The series comprises the three novels &quot;The Faded Sun: Kesrith&quot; (1978), &quot;The Faded Sun: Shon&#x27;jir&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Faded Sun: Kutath&quot; (1979), published by DAW Books. They were republished as an omnibus edition in the UK in 1987 and in the U.S. in 2000.
==Overview==
The series consists of some of the earliest of Cherryh&#x27;s novels, featuring world-building and a number of alien species. &quot;The Faded Sun: Kesrith&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award in 1978 and the Hugo Award in 1979 and was shortlisted for the Locus Awards in 1979. In addition, the other two books in the trilogy were independently longlisted for the Locus Award.

==Plot summary==

The Faded Sun trilogy can be considered a Bildungsroman, since one of the major themes is the coming of age of Niun, the mri protagonist. At the same time, it is a story of acculturation, as the human protagonist, Sten Duncan, lives among the mri to the point of becoming one of them.

The Faded Sun trilogy is the principal account of the Mri Wars era of Cherryh&#x27;s Alliance-Union universe. At the beginning of the first volume, the regul have just concluded a forty-year war with humanity. As part of the peace, they are ceding the desert world of Kesrith to humanity. However, they have neglected to inform its inhabitants, the mri, who have served them as mercenaries for over two thousand years.

The Mri have been nearly exterminated in these wars, and young Niun is one of the few remaining warriors. When the regul seek to double-cross his people, he and his sister Melein, the last of the priestly Sen caste, form an uneasy alliance with the human Sten Duncan to rescue a holy relic that may hold the key to the Mri&#x27;s survival.

The second volume opens with Niun and Melein captives of the human occupation force, kept alive by the human medicine they would refuse if they were not sedated. But the human command has a plan that may thwart the regul&#x27;s attempted genocide of the Mri. They produce a navigation tape from the data in the holy relic that legend holds leads the way to the Mri homeworld and set Niun and Melein aboard the ship. Duncan comes with them to keep the ship running.

Soon after they have left Kesrith, Melein lays down a mandate that nothing that is not mri can make the return to the ancient mri homeworld. As a result, Duncan must become Mri or die. With Niun as his teacher, Duncan learns the stern rules of the Mri warrior caste, the Kel. Retracing the voyages of the Mri takes years, jump after jump, giving Duncan time to become Mri. With each jump, they find evidence of previous Mri civilizations, each one destroyed, further and further back in time. Eventually, they realize that this is not the first time that the Mri have been almost exterminated; in fact, the entire Mri history has been made up of the Mri fighting as mercenaries for other races, then being turned upon once their usefulness has ended, as the race(s) employing the Mri did not wish the possibility that the Mri might go and work for their enemies and be used against their former employers.

When the ship lands on Kutath, the ancient homeworld of the mri, the three find other mri, the tribes who remained. They also discover that humans and Regul have followed their ship, and the Regul have not forgotten their determination to commit genocide. After an unprovoked attack, Duncan goes back to the human ship and slays the Regul Elder.

When the third volume begins, the regul are in a state of disarray as a result of the assassination. Duncan returns to the mri and joins them in seeking assistance from the Elee, the other surviving race of ancient Kutath. After a new Elder has risen among the regul, they renew their attack on the Mri. This time humanity acts to halt the genocide, breaking the cycle, and forming a new partnership with the Mri.

<text>The Mikoyan MiG-29M (; NATO reporting name: Fulcrum-E) is a Russian multirole fighter that first flew in 2005. The unified platform that is the MiG-29 is now comprised by the MiG-29M and a naval carrier variant, the MiG-29K. A direct predecessor of the MiG-29M, sometimes known informally as the &quot;MiG-33&quot;, was developed by the Mikoyan design bureau in the mid-1980s.

==Development==
In the mid-1980s, a development of the original MiG-29 was proposed to meet the Soviet western frontline requirement. It was required to be a multirole fighter for the frontline defensive air force to gain offensive strike ability. This development resulted in a single-seat and a two-seat variant. The proposal was then grounded as a result of shifts in military strategy. The model was named &quot;MiG-33&quot; and later received the MiG-29ME designation for the export market in the mid-1990s. A two-seat model of the standard, commonly known as the MiG-29MRCA, was the MAPO-MiG&#x27;s primary contender for many international fighter aircraft bids, later evolved into the Mikoyan MiG-35. Six of these models were built before 1990. They were constantly upgraded with various components and one received experimental vector thrust engines which eventually became the MiG-29OVT.

Current model with designation MiG-29M is developed as land variant of MiG-29K with whom it shares avionic and other components and now belongs to the &quot;new unified family&quot; instead of the &quot;MiG-29 fighters family&quot; which comprise the older variants. MiG-29M2 represents two–seat variant of MiG-29M.

===&quot;MiG-33&quot;===
During the early 1990s, it became briefly popular for Sukhoi and Mikoyan to assign new designations for upgraded models to make them appear &quot;new and improved&quot; instead of just &quot;improved&quot;. The VVS did not accept these marketing designations and most were soon dropped. Following Sukhoi&#x27;s initiative in this approach, Mikoyan&#x27;s first such offering was the &quot;MiG-29ME&quot;, which first publicly appeared as the &quot;MiG-33&quot; at the 1994 Farnborough Airshow. The MiG-29ME was the export version of the &quot;MiG-29M&quot; (Product 9.15) &quot;Super Fulcrum&quot;, a comprehensively upgraded, fully multirole version of the MiG-29.

Although the MiG-33 designation was soon dropped, the MiG-29M may have merited a new designation in that it is in many ways a thoroughly redesigned version of the MiG-29. While external differences are few, the MiG-29M was a fully &quot;multifunctional&quot; fighter capable of performing air-to-ground combat with precision-guided munitions (PGMs), along with air-to-air roles of earlier MiG-29 versions. Pilot-aircraft interfaces in the cockpit were also improved and a wide range of new-generation equipment installed. The aircraft&#x27;s internal fuel capacity was also increased to add combat range.

===Procurement===
In November 2013, it was reported that Egypt and Russia were negotiating an order of 24 MiG-29M/M2s for the Egyptian Air Force. In April 2015, Egypt became the first export customer when it signed a $2 billion contract for the purchase of 46 MiG-29M/M2 multi-role fighters On 26 October it was reported that Algeria become second country outside Russia to procure the MiG-29M. In March 2021 there were talks between Argentina and Russia regarding the purchase of MiG-29M and MiG-35.

==Design==

The MiG-29M/M2 aircraft is a revision of the basic MiG-29. It achieved a more multi-role capability with enhanced use of air-to-air and air-to-ground high-precision weapons. It also featured a considerably increased combat range, owing to an increase in its internal fuel capacity.

A few changes took place during the aircraft&#x27;s development. The redesigned airframe was constructed from a lightweight Aluminium-lithium alloy to increase the thrust-to-weight ratio. The air intake ramps&#x27; geometry was revised, the upper intake louvers were removed to make way for more fuel in the LERXs, mesh screens introduced to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) and inlet dimensions were enlarged for higher airflow.

The aircraft is built with an inflight-refueling (IFR) probe and is able to carry three fuel drop tanks. The redesigned airframe also significantly increased internal fuel capacity in the dorsal spine and LERXs fuel tanks. These give the single-seat aircraft an operational range of 2,000 km with internal fuel, 3,200 km with three fuel drop tanks, and 6,000 km with three drop tanks and inflight refueling.

===Powerplant===
The RD-33MK, the latest revision of the RD-33, has 7% more power in comparison to the baseline model due to the use of modern materials on the cooled blades, and provides a thrust of 9,000 kgf. In response to longtime criticism, the new engines are smokeless and contain improvements that reduce its infrared visibility. Thrust vectoring nozzles are now offered upon customer&#x27;s request. Dry weight is 1,145 kilograms (2,520 lb) compared to the baseline model through modern materials used on the cooled blades, although it retains the same length and maximum diameter. Incorporated is an infrared and optical signature visibility reduction system. Service life has been increased to 4,000 hours.

===Sensors===
Main upgrades consist of the Zhuk-ME pulse-Doppler airborne radar, along with revised IRST systems, a helmet-mounted target designation system and electronic countermeasures. According to PHAZOTRON&#x27;s product brochure, new radar is capable of detecting air targets at ranges up to 80 km, track-while-scan of ten targets, track four targets and attack two targets at a time.

==Operational history==
===Egypt===
Egypt signed a contract for 46 MiG-29M/M2 in April 2015, with deliveries to be completed by 2020. The Egyptian variant is designated as the MiG-29M (9.41SM) for the single seater, and MiG-29M2 (9.47SM) for the two seater. They are in many aspects similar to the MiG-35, which was first displayed in Lukhovitsy in January 2017.

The Egyptian MiG&#x27;s include the upgraded RD-33MK smokeless engines, Zhuk-ME pulse-doppler radar, latest OLS-UE electro-optical targeting station, which feeds both TV and IR imagery to the cockpit display and includes a laser rangefinder, unlike previous IRSTs installed on MiG-29s that only featured IR imagery, and the T220/e targeting pod, allowing the utilization of precision-guided munitions, as well as unguided bombs with a low circular error probability. For electronic warfare purposes, the aircraft will be supplied with the MSP-418K active jammer pod which uses DRFM technology to spoof radar-guided missiles. The pod was previously displayed at MAKS air shows and is yet to enter service with the Russian Air Force.

The country received its first batch of MiG-29M/M2s in April 2017, and by the end of the year had 15 aircraft in its inventory. A proposed modernization is intended to follow in 2020, providing refinements to the airborne radar, software and other avionics. The Egyptian Air Force is expected to keep its MiG-29Ms in service until 2060.

On 3 November 2018, an Egyptian Air Force MiG-29Ms crashed due to a technical malfunction when on a routine training flight. Pilot ejected safely.

Five of the MiG-29s were at Merowe Air Base at the start of the 2023 Sudan clashes where they were captured by the Rapid Support Forces. By 17 April 2023, satellite imagary appeared to show at least one had been destroyed and two damaged.

===Syria===
A first contract for 12 of the new fighters was signed in 2007, making the Syrian Air Force the very first client, with deliveries set to be completed by 2012. Syria reportedly agreed to buy 12 additional MiG-29M/M2s in 2012. In July 2012 at the Farnborough Air Show, Russia announced it would not deliver weapons, including combat aircraft, to Syria due to the ongoing Syria Civil War. On 31 May 2013, RSK MiG&#x27;s director general, Sergei Korotkov, stated that the company plans to sign a contract with Syria to deliver &quot;more than 10&quot; MiG-29 M/M2 and that a Syrian delegation was in Moscow to discuss terms and deadlines of a new contract supplying fighter jets to Syria. At the end of May 2020, a batch of 12 MiG-29SMTs has been delivered.

===Serbia===
The Serbian Air Force intended to buy several MIG-29M/M2s to replace its aging MiG-21 fleet. In 2013, media reports indicated that Serbia planned to purchase six MiG-29M/M2 fighters. Instead of buying MiG-29M in October 2017, Russia donated six used MiG-29 fighters to the Serbian Air Force, with Serbia paying to upgrade them.

===Algeria===
Algeria procured 14 MiG-29M/M2 according to a contract signed in 2019 during the international military fair MAKS. Deliveries started in October 2020.

==Variants==
;MiG-29M / MiG-33 (Product 9.15)

<text>Infidels were a Canadian funk rock band in the 1990s. The band won a Juno Award as Most Promising Group in 1992.

==History==

The band formed in 1990 when Molly Johnson reunited with Norman Orenstein, her partner in the short-lived 1980s band Alta Moda. The duo originally wrote a number of songs that they planned to offer to Candi and the Backbeat, and sent them to the Canadian division of IRS Records, Candi&#x27;s label. IRS president Paul Orescan, who had heard their work as Alta Moda, offered instead to sign them to record a new album. Considering Alta Moda to be a finished project, Johnson chose the new name as a tribute to the Bob Dylan album &quot;Infidels&quot;. They added Washington Savage, Jeff Jones and Owen Tennyson to the lineup, and released a self-titled album in 1991.

The single &quot;100 Watt Bulb&quot; peaked at #25 in the &quot;RPM&quot; charts the week of November 23, 1991, &quot;Celebrate&quot; peaked at #12 the week of February 22, 1992, &quot;Without Love&quot; peaked at #30 in the RPM charts the week of June 6, 1992 and &quot;Shaking&quot; peaked at #68 in the RPM charts the week of September 12, 1992. Despite the chart success of &quot;100 Watt Bulb&quot; and &quot;Celebrate&quot;, however, the album was only a modest seller, peaking at #74 in &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s albums chart the week of February 29, 1992.

The band won the award for Most Promising Group of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1992. Later the same year, Johnson and Orenstein collaborated with Meryn Cadell on the non-album single &quot;Courage&quot;, a song about the environment. Written for the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, the song was released on a split single with The Razorbacks&#x27; &quot;Land for Dreams&quot; and its video was filmed at the Canadian Museum of Civilization.

The band recorded a second album in 1995, but were faced with label difficulties. The label wanted them to change their name because there was another band of the same name from Youngstown, Ohio, but Johnson and Orenstein resisted, since they were already well-associated with that name in Canada. As well, the label was going through financial difficulties at the time. As a result, Johnson decided to dissolve the band, and the 1995 album has never been released.

Johnson now performs as a jazz singer. Savage went on to form the band Blaxäm with Tuku and Saidah Talibah Matthews.

<doc id="943049" wikidata="Q318297" url="?curid=943049" title="Ross Macdonald">
<text>Ross Macdonald was the main pseudonym used by the American-Canadian writer of crime fiction Kenneth Millar (; December 13, 1915 – July 11, 1983). He is best known for his series of hardboiled novels set in Southern California and featuring private detective Lew Archer. Since the 1970s, Macdonald&#x27;s works (particularly the Archer novels) have received attention in academic circles for their psychological depth, sense of place, use of language, sophisticated imagery and integration of philosophy into genre fiction. Brought up in the province of Ontario, Canada, Macdonald eventually settled in the state of California, where he died in 1983.

The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that:... it is the sheer beauty of Macdonald’s laconic style—with its seductive rhythms and elegant plainness—that holds us spellbound. &quot;Hard-boiled,&quot; &quot;noir,&quot; &quot;mystery,&quot; it doesn’t matter what you call it. Macdonald, with insolent grace, blows past the barrier constructed by Dorothy Sayers between &quot;the literature of escape&quot; and &quot;the literature of expression.&quot; These novels, triumphs of his literary alchemy, dare to be both.

==Life==
Millar was born in Los Gatos, California, and raised in his Canadian parents&#x27; native Kitchener, Ontario. &quot;Millar&quot; was a Scots spelling of the surname Miller, and the author pronounced his name &quot;Miller&quot; rather than &quot;Millar&quot;. When his father abandoned the family unexpectedly when Millar was four years old, he and his mother lived with various relatives, and he had moved several times by his 16th year. Back in Canada as a young adult, he returned to Kitchener, where he studied, and subsequently graduated from the University of Western Ontario with an Honors degree in History and English. He found work as a high school teacher. Some years later, he attended the University of Michigan and received a PhD in 1952. He married Margaret Sturm in 1938, though they&#x27;d known each other earlier in high school. They had a daughter in 1939, Linda, who died in 1970. The family moved from Kitchener to Santa Barbara in 1946.

Millar began his career writing stories for pulp magazines and used his real name for his first four novels. Of these he completed the first, &quot;The Dark Tunnel&quot;, in 1944. After serving at sea as a naval communications officer from 1944 to 1946, Millar returned to Michigan, where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in literature. For his doctorate, Millar studied under poet W. H. Auden, who (unusually for a prominent literary intellectual of the era) held mystery or detective fiction could rise to the level of literature and encouraged Millar&#x27;s interest in the genre.

For his fifth novel, in 1949, he wrote under the name John Macdonald (his father&#x27;s first and middle names) in order to avoid confusion with his wife, who was achieving her own success writing as Margaret Millar. He then changed his pen name briefly to John Ross Macdonald, before settling on Ross Macdonald (Ross borrowed from a favorite cousin) in order to avoid being confused with fellow mystery writer John D. MacDonald, who was writing under his real name. Millar would use the pseudonym Ross Macdonald on all his fiction from the mid &#x27;50s forward.

Most of his books were set primarily in and around his adopted hometown of Santa Barbara. In these works, the city where Lew Archer is based goes under the fictional name of Santa Teresa.

In 1983 Macdonald died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Work==
Macdonald first introduced the tough but humane private eye Lew Archer in the 1946 short story &quot;Find the Woman&quot; (credited then to &quot;Ken Millar&quot;). A novel featuring him, &quot;The Moving Target&quot;, (1949) was the first in a series of eighteen. Macdonald mentions in the foreword to the &quot;Archer in Hollywood&quot; omnibus that his detective derives his name from Sam Spade&#x27;s partner, Miles Archer, and from Lewis Wallace, author of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, though the character was patterned on Philip Marlowe. Macdonald also said the surname &quot;Archer&quot; was inspired by his own astrological sign of Sagittarius the archer.

The novels were hailed by genre fans and literary critics alike. He has been called the primary heir to Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler as the master of American hardboiled mysteries.

Macdonald&#x27;s writing built on the pithy style of his predecessors by adding psychological depth and insights into the motivations of his characters. His plots, described as of &quot;baroque splendor&quot;, were complicated and often turned on Archer&#x27;s unearthing family secrets of upwardly mobile clients, sometimes going back over several generations. Lost or wayward sons and daughters were a theme common to many of the novels. Critics have commented favorably on Macdonald&#x27;s deft combination of the two sides of the mystery genre, the &quot;whodunit&quot; and the psychological thriller. Even his regular readers seldom saw a Macdonald denouement coming.

Tom Nolan, Macdonald&#x27;s biographer, wrote, &quot;By any standard he was remarkable. His first books, patterned on Hammett and Chandler, were at once vivid chronicles of a postwar California and elaborate retellings of Greek and other classic myths. Gradually he swapped the hard-boiled trappings for more subjective themes: personal identity, the family secret, the family scapegoat, the childhood trauma; how men and women need and battle each other, how the buried past rises like a skeleton to confront the present. He brought the tragic drama of Freud and the psychology of Sophocles to detective stories, and his prose flashed with poetic imagery.&quot;

==Recognition==

The Lew Archer novels are recognized as some of the most significant American mystery books of the mid 20th century, bringing a literary sophistication to the genre. Literary critic John Leonard declared that Macdonald had surpassed the limits of crime fiction to become &quot;a major American novelist&quot;. William Goldman, who adapted Macdonald&#x27;s &quot;The Moving Target&quot; to film as &quot;Harper&quot; in 1966, called his works &quot;the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American&quot;. A later film adaptation was &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot; (1975), also starring Paul Newman as the detective Lew Harper. In addition, &quot;The Underground Man&quot; was adapted as a TV movie in 1974.

Over his career, Macdonald was presented with several awards. In 1964, the Mystery Writers of America awarded him the Silver Dagger award for &quot;The Chill&quot;. Ten years later, he received the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America, and in 1982 he received &quot;The Eye,&quot; the Lifetime Achievement Shamus Award from the Private Eye Writers of America. In 1982, he was awarded the Robert Kirsch Award by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; for &quot;an outstanding body of work by an author from the West or featuring the West.&quot;

<doc id="943078" wikidata="Q486416" url="?curid=943078" title="Paik Sun-yup">
<text>Paik Sun-yup (; November 23, 1920 – July 10, 2020) was a Republic of Korea Army four-star general who became the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1959 to 1960. Paik is best known for his service during the Korean War, becoming the first four-star general in the history of the South Korean military, and for his service as a diplomat and statesman for South Korea.

==Early life and education==
Paik was born in Tokhung in Kangso County, South Pyeongan Province (called Heian&#x27;nan-dō - the Japanese transliteration of the Sino-Korean name Pyeongan-namdo, i.e. south Pyeongan province - during Japanese occupation), Korea, Empire of Japan on November 23, 1920. He was the second of three siblings, with an older sister and younger brother, being raised by a widowed mother. In 1925 the Paik family moved to Pyongyang (called Heijō during Japanese occupation), where they lived under deplorable conditions in a single, rented room. Unable to feed her family, Paik&#x27;s mother attempted to commit family-suicide with her children by jumping from the Taedong River Bridge (at the time the Daidō River Bridge) but was dissuaded from doing so by her eldest daughter.

Paik&#x27;s mother and sister soon took jobs at a rubber factory. this in addition with the help of a greatly reduced tuition allowed Paik to attend Mansu Primary School for four years before transferring to Yaksong Primary School. After which, he spent five years in Pyongyang Normal School, studying to be a teacher. However, in 1939, instead of becoming a teacher, he entered the Mukden Military Academy of Manchukuo.

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduation from the Mukden Military Academy of Manchukuo, Paik became a second lieutenant in the Manchukuo Imperial Army and was assigned to the Gando Special Force, engaging in guerrilla suppression work in Jiandao (eastern Manchuria, Gando in Korean) as part of the Japanese campaign in northern China against the 8th Route Army of Communist China for ten months from 1944 to 1945 until its defeat by the Red Army. 
After the end of World War II, he returned to Pyongyang and started working as an assistant to Kim Ku (a leader of the Korean independence movement against the Empire of Japan). In December 1945, he fled south due to the rising communist&#x27;s presence. After safely reaching South Korea, he enlisted in the Constabulary, the predecessor of the ROK Army, as a first lieutenant. In this role, he was tasked with suppressing communist guerrillas (the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion). While undertaking this responsibility, he helped Park Chung Hee, who was at the time being tried as a communist, by persuading President Syngman Rhee to commute his sentence and have him released. Paik eventually had him reinstated into the army during the Korean War.
Before the outbreak of the Korean War, Paik was promoted to Colonel, from which he received the command of the 5th Infantry Division on July 30, 1949. Then on April 23, 1950, had his command transferred to the 1st Infantry Division.

===Korean War===
When the fighting broke out at 4:00 am on June 25, 1950, he was stationed in Seoul for officer training at the Infantry School. At 7:00 am, Paik was alerted to the invasion by the 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s Chief of Staff.
Upon receiving the alert, Paik reassumed command of the 1st Infantry Division, which was involved in heavy fighting near Kaesong and Munsan. After resisting the onslaught for three days, Paik received orders to stand his ground and fight to the last man. This was because the 1st Infantry Division was the only remaining obstacle between the North Korean People&#x27;s Army and Seoul. However, after the fall of Seoul and due to the overwhelming offensive by North Korean armored units, he was forced into a fighting withdrawal. This is significant due to the fact that the 1st Division withdrew while maintaining its order of battle while fighting a delaying action. This led to Paik being promoted to Brigadier General on July 25, 1950.
Paik then pulled back to the Nakdong River along the Pusan Perimeter, the last-ditch defense of the allied forces, on the southern tip of Korea. Here he commanded the RoK 1st Div., which was responsible for the holding of a 55-mile front on the northern boundary of the Pusan Perimeter. During which he was heavily supported by American units. Furthermore, it was during this desperate battle that he successfully commanded the first joint operation between Korean and American Forces. Though his lines were stretched thin during this battle, the RoK 1st Div. successfully held off against successive assaults by the Koreans People&#x27;s Army&#x27;s 2nd, 3rd, and 15th divisions. During this time, the RoK 1 Div. received adequate anti-tank weaponry, which allowed them to form ‘hunter-killer teams’ and destroy the North Korean&#x27;s dreaded T-34-85 tanks.
In August 1950, Paik along with Col. Michaelis, commander of the US 27th regiment, led the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter northward. The battle of Dabu-dong is seen as one of the major turning points of the Korean War.
The offensive northward was both rapid and brutal. However, it was during this phase of the war that Paik was honored with the recapture of both his birthplace and the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang, on October 19, 1950. After spending several days securing the city, he was ordered further northward toward the Yalu River, on the Chinese border. It was Paik who was one of the first commanders of the Allied nations to realize The People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s intervention into the conflict. Paik, being fluent in Chinese, was personally able to interrogate the first Chinese prisoners of war who were captured; however, his warnings of the intervention went unheeded by the overall theater command, who did not believe that the PRC had entered the conflict. 
Later, once the threat of the Chinese was fully realized Paik would go on to assume command of the defense of northwestern Korea but was continuously pushed back both by the superior numbers and ferocity of the Chinese Second Phase Offensive. It was during this stage of the war that Paik was again promoted to the command of the ROK 1st Corp, which was tasked with the securing of eastern Korea. After he arrived to assume his new command, he found the ROK 1st Corp to be made up of green recruits and conscripts who had neither sufficient training nor battle experience; because of this, he would spend much of his early time at this post intensively training his men and fortifying the battle line.

====Armistice Negotiations====
Armistice talks between the United Nations and the North Koreans and Chinese began in July 1951. Paik was selected as the South Korean representative. Paik was fundamentally opposed to the peace negotiations, fearing that it would lead to the abandonment of a unified Korea.

By August, Paik was told to report back to the ROK I Corps where he oversaw the heavy fighting around the 38th parallel at the Punchbowl, a large crater surrounded by hills, and Heartbreak Ridge. His troops were now fighting a war of attrition, with both the United Nations and the Communist digging in and ever more fortifying their positions. Just as with the trench warfare of the First World War, the casualties were atrocious and there was little to show for the loss of life. In May 1952, Paik expressed to President Eisenhower the strong opposition of the Korean people to an armistice. However, due to the stagnation of the war, the armistice was signed with Korea remaining divided.

During the war, Paik did not make major mistakes, such as the disintegration of formations that plagued other commanders. He also maintained a smooth relationship with the U.S. military officers. His actions and successes greatly contributed to the U.S. military&#x27;s positive assessment of the ROK military. This in turn, motivated the U.S. military command to recognize the ROK military as a useful ally in the then still developing Cold War.

==Later career==
===1952 to 1986===
In 1952 and 1957 he was twice appointed as the Chief of Staff. Afterwards, in 1959 he was appointed as the Joint Chief of Staff of the Republic of Korea Army. After retiring from the military, he was appointed ambassador to the Republic of China in July 1960.
In July 1961, he served as the Republic of Korea ambassador to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg. On July 16, 1961, while serving as ambassador to France, he traveled to Senegal as a representative of the Korea-Senegalese Friendship Mission. There he met with Senegalese Prime Minister Dudu Thiam. In 1961, he served as ambassador to Gabon, Togo, Senegal, Chad, The Congo, Madagascar, Central African Republic, Niger, Ivory Coast, Benin, Republic of the Congo, Upper Volta and Mauritania. On August 27, 1963, while serving as the South Korean ambassador to Cameroon, Paik (then adjunct ambassador to France), established relations with President Amadou Ahizo.
In July 1965, Paik served as the first Korean Ambassador to Canada, after which he was appointed the Minister of Transportation of Korea in October 1969. Paik directed the construction of Seoul&#x27;s public transportation infrastructure, which included the subway system. 
In 1971, he was appointed president of Chungju Fertilizer Co., and served as president of Korea Integrated Chemical Inc. After which, he was appointed as the director of the National Economic Association. Then in 1972, he completed a CEO course at Yonsei University business school and in 1973 was presented a certificate by the chief executive officer of Korea University business school.
He was appointed president of Korea Chemical Industries in April 1973, where he directed the construction of the largest fertilizing manufactory plant in Southeast Asia at the time. He was later appointed president of adjunct Korea Chemical Pulp in 1974 and became president of the Fertilizer Industry Association in 1975. from 1976 to 1981, he served as director of the Korea Chemical Research Institute. In 1976, he completed a CEO course at Seoul National University business school.
In March 1981, he resigned from his position as President of Korea Chemicals. In March 1980, after resigning from the presidency of Korea Chemical Industries he was appointed as an adviser to Fujitsu Korea. Later he was appointed the chairman of the Korea Chemical Research Institute, director of the Korea Chemical Research Institute, and National Chairperson of the International Chamber of Commerce and Industry and was appointed to the permanent Advisory Office of the National Unification Agency in 1986, which included conducting security and lecture activities.

===1998 to 2020===
In 1998, he was appointed chairman of the Commemorative Projects Committee on the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. From 1999 to 2001 he was selected to be the Advisory Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the No Gun Ri Incident Countermeasures Group.
In 2013, the U.S. military in Korea appointed him as an &quot;Honorary U.S. 8th Army Commander&quot; and as whom he would represent the U.S. 8th Army in Korea during various official events. In South Korea, President Lee Myung-Bak attempted to promote Paik Sun-yup to the position of the First Head of the ROK Armed Forces, but this was ultimately denied. 
Then in 2008, in the Pro-Japanese Personalities and People&#x27;s Exhibition published by the Institute for National Affairs included Paik in the military section of prospective chinilpa candidates, due to his prior service in the Manchukuo Imperial Army. Furthermore, in 2009, the Roh Moo-hyun administration&#x27;s National Behavior Commission included Paik Sun-yup in the highly controversial list of 705 chinilpas.
In May 2008, he was appointed as an advisor to the Committee to Promote the 60th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of Korea. On March 23, 2009, it was reported that the South Korean government planned to honor Paik as an honorary field marshal in honor of the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. If implemented, Paik would have become South Korea&#x27;s first field marshal, this however would not come to fruition.

On January 30, 2019, a group in consisting of retired South Korean generals of which Paik served as an advisor, released a statement criticizing the administration of South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the Comprehensive Military Agreement which was signed with North Korea at the September 2018 inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang.

He died on July 10, 2020, at the age of 99, four months short of his 100th birthday and was buried in Daejeon National Cemetery. Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs claimed the reason Paik was buried in Daejeon National Cemetery was because the designated area for generals in Seoul National Cemetery was full.

<text>The Slovene-Croatian Peasant Revolt (, ), Gubec&#x27;s Rebellion () or Gubec&#x27;s peasant uprising of 1573 was a large peasant revolt on territory forming modern-day northwestern Croatia and southeastern Slovenia. The revolt, sparked by cruel treatment of serfs by Baron Ferenc Tahy, ended after 12 days with the defeat of the rebels and bloody retribution by the nobility.

==Background==

In the late 16th century, the threat of Ottoman incursions strained the economy of the southern flanks of the Holy Roman Empire, and feudal lords continually increased their demands on the peasantry. In Croatian Zagorje, this was compounded by cruel treatment of peasants by Baron Ferenc Tahy and his disputes with neighbouring barons over land, dating back to 1564, which escalated into armed conflicts. When multiple complaints to the emperor went unheard, the peasants conspired to rebel with their peers in the neighbouring provinces of Styria and Carniola and with the lower classes of townspeople.

==Revolt==
The rebellion broke out simultaneously in large parts of Carniola, Styria, and Croatia on 28 January 1573. The rebels&#x27; political program was to replace the nobility with peasant officials answerable directly to the emperor, and to abolish all feudal holdings and obligations to the Roman Catholic Church. A peasant government was formed with Matija Gubec, Ivan Pasanec, and Ivan Mogaić as members. Far-reaching plans were drawn up, including abolition of provincial borders, opening of highways for trade, and self-rule by the peasants.

The captain of the rebels, Ilija Gregorić, planned an extensive military operation to secure victory for the revolt. Each peasant household provided one man for his army, which met with some initial success; their revolutionary goals alarmed the nobility, however, which raised armies in response. The rebels used a network of informers who relayed the information on movements of the opposing units; in turn, spies among the peasants themselves passed the information on the spread of the rebellion to the nobility.

==Backlash==

On 5 February, Uskok captain and baron Jobst Joseph von Thurn () led an army of 500 Uskoks from Kostanjevica and some German soldiers that defeated a rebel detachment of Nikola Kupinič at Krško (in Lower Styria), which was the first larger rebel defeat. This rapidly weakened the rebellion in Carniola and Styria.

The next day, another rebel force was defeated near Samobor. On 9 February, the decisive Battle of Stubičko polje was fought. Gubec and his 10,000 men resisted fiercely, but after a bloody four-hour battle the baronial army defeated and captured Gubec. The revolt failed.

Retribution was brutal: in addition to the 3,000 peasants who died in the battle, many captives were hanged or maimed. Matija Gubec was publicly tortured and executed on 15 February. Officers Petar Ljubojević, Vuk Suković, and Dane Bolčeta (who were Orthodox), and Juraj Martijanović and Tomo Tortić (Catholics) were all sentenced to life in prison and lost all their property. Mogaić was killed in the final battle, and Pasanec was most probably killed in one of the skirmishes in early February. Gregorić managed to escape, but was captured within weeks, brought to Vienna for interrogation, and executed in Zagreb in 1574.

==Legacy==
The revolt and torture of Gubec acquired legendary status in Croatia and Slovenia. It has inspired many writers and artists, including the writers Miroslav Krleža and August Šenoa, the poet Anton Aškerc and the sculptors Antun Augustinčić and Stojan Batič. Leading Croatian film director Vatroslav Mimica produced the film about uprising, entitled &quot;Anno Domini 1573&quot;, in 1975, as well as television series in four parts. &quot;Gubec-beg&quot;, the first Croatian rock opera (1975), was also inspired by the events. The painter Krsto Hegedušić made in 1969 the stage curtain for the Hrvatsko Narodno Kazalište in Zagreb, titled &quot;A.D. 1573&quot;.
A museum near Oršić Castle in Gornja Stubica and one in Krško (Slovenia) are dedicated to the revolt.

A reenactment of the Battle of Stubičko polje, held every year since 2008, has since become one of the most popular historical reenactments in Croatia.

<doc id="943115" wikidata="Q6515708" url="?curid=943115" title="Lee v. Weisman">
<text>Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court decision regarding school prayer. It was the first major school prayer case decided by the Rehnquist Court. It held that schools may not sponsor clerics to conduct even non-denominational prayer. The Court followed a broad interpretation of the Establishment Clause that had been standard for decades at the nation&#x27;s highest court, a reaffirmation of the principles of such landmark cases as &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; and &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot;.

==Background==
Robert E. Lee was the principal of Nathan Bishop Middle School in Providence, Rhode Island. He invited a rabbi to deliver a prayer at the 1989 graduation ceremony, but the day before the ceremony, the parents of student Deborah Weisman filed a motion in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island for a temporary restraining order to bar the rabbi from delivering the invocation, arguing that it would violate the Establishment Clause. Chief Judge Francis J. Boyle denied the Weismans&#x27; motion, &quot;essentially because the Court was not afforded adequate time to consider the important issues of the case&quot;. The family did attend the graduation ceremony, and the rabbi did deliver the benediction.

The Weismans continued their litigation after the graduation, and Chief Judge Boyle ultimately ruled in their favor, issuing an order &quot;permanently enjoining the School Committee of the City of Providence, its agents or employees from authorizing or encouraging the use of prayer in connection with school graduation or promotion exercises&quot;. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the District Court&#x27;s order, over the dissenting opinion of Judge Levin H. Campbell. The school district petitioned for a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; in the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the prayer was nonsectarian and was doubly voluntary: Deborah was free not to stand for the prayer and because participation in the ceremony itself was not required. Arguments were heard on November 6, 1991. Charles J. Cooper appeared for the petitioners, Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr argued as &quot;amicus curiae&quot; on behalf of the Bush administration in support of the school district, and Rhode Island attorney Sandra A. Blanding appeared on behalf of the Weismans. Justice Anthony Kennedy had been critical of the Court&#x27;s decisions on school prayer, and many court watchers thought that he would provide the crucial fifth vote to reverse the lower court&#x27;s ruling and deal a major blow to the twin separationist pillars of &quot;Engel&quot; and &quot;Abington&quot;.

==Decision==
The 5–4 decision was announced on June 24, 1992. It was somewhat surprising as a victory for the Weismans and a defeat for the school district. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which maintained previous Supreme Court precedents sharply limiting the place of religion within the nation&#x27;s public schools—far from joining those who favored curtailing restrictions on school prayers. The Blackmun papers reveal that Kennedy switched his vote during the deliberations, as he also did in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, saying that his draft majority opinion upholding the prayer exercise &quot;looked quite wrong.&quot; Instead, Kennedy wrote an opinion that repudiated the school district&#x27;s main arguments. He found fault with Principal Lee&#x27;s decision to give the rabbi who was planning to offer the graduation invocation a pamphlet on composing prayers for civic occasions:

:Through these means, the principal directed and controlled the content of the prayers. Even if the only sanction for ignoring the instructions were that the rabbi would not be invited back, we think no religious representative who valued his or her continued reputation and effectiveness in the community would incur the State&#x27;s displeasure in this regard. It is a cornerstone principle of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government, and that is what the school officials attempted to do.

Kennedy also noted that the nonsectarian nature of the prayer was no defense, as the Establishment Clause forbade coerced prayers in public schools, not just those representing a specific religious tradition. He addressed the State&#x27;s contention that attendance was voluntary at the graduation exercises:

:To say a teenage student has a real choice not to attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the extreme. True, Deborah could elect not to attend commencement without renouncing her diploma; but we shall not allow the case to turn on this point. Everyone knows that, in our society and in our culture, high school graduation is one of life&#x27;s most significant occasions. A school rule which excuses attendance is beside the point. Attendance may not be required by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student is not free to absent herself from the graduation exercise in any real sense of the term &quot;voluntary,&quot; for absence would require forfeiture of those intangible benefits which have motivated the student through youth and all her high school years.

Finally, Kennedy formulated what is now known as the coercion test in answering the argument that participation in the prayer was voluntary:

:The school district&#x27;s supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places subtle and indirect public and peer pressure on attending students to stand as a group or maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. A reasonable dissenter of high school age could believe that standing or remaining silent signified her own participation in, or approval of, the group exercise, rather than her respect for it. And the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a &quot;de minimis&quot; character, since that is an affront to the rabbi and those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors&#x27; rights.

:The principle that government may accommodate the free exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause. It is beyond dispute that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which &quot;establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.&quot;

:As we have observed before, there are heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public schools. Our decisions in [Engel] and [Abington] recognize, among other things, that prayer exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion. The concern may not be limited to the context of schools, but it is most pronounced there. What to most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request that the nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the State to enforce a religious orthodoxy.

===Concurring opinions===

Justice Blackmun&#x27;s concurrence stressed that &quot;our decisions have gone beyond prohibiting coercion, however, because the Court has recognized that &#x27;the fullest possible scope of religious liberty,&#x27; entails more than freedom from coercion.&quot; Blackmun emphasized that the government was without power to place its imprimatur on any religious activity, even if no one was compelled to participate in a state-sponsored religious exercise, directly or indirectly.

Justice Souter devoted his concurring opinion to a historical analysis, rebutting the contention that the government could endorse nonsectarian prayers. He cited the writings of James Madison and pointed to the changing versions of the First Amendment that the First Congress considered, as opposed to the version which was eventually adopted. Souter, too, took issue with the school district&#x27;s defense of non-coercive religious exercises, dismissing the position as without precedential authority.

===Dissenting opinion===
Justice Scalia&#x27;s dissent argued against the coercion test:

:In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits invocations and benedictions at public school graduation ceremonies, the Court - with nary a mention that it is doing so - lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school graduation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of an even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public celebrations generally. As its instrument of destruction, the bulldozer of its social engineering, the Court invents a boundless, and boundlessly manipulable, test of psychological coercion.

Scalia pointed to several historical examples of calling on divine guidance by American Presidents, including Washington&#x27;s proclamation of the Thanksgiving holiday in 1789 and the inaugural addresses of both Madison and Thomas Jefferson. He disputed the Court&#x27;s contention that attendance at high school graduation ceremonies was effectively required as part of social norms, and also the conclusion that students were subtly coerced to stand for the rabbi&#x27;s invocation. In Scalia&#x27;s view, only official penalties for refusing to support or adhere to a particular religion created an Establishment Clause violation.

==Subsequent developments==

The coercion test is now used to determine the constitutionality of certain government actions under the Establishment Clause, along with Justice O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;endorsement or disapproval&quot; test. The test &quot;seeks to determine whether the state has applied coercive pressure on an individual to support or participate in religion.&quot;

A broad reading of the Establishment Clause won out, but it seems to have its greatest current application in a public school context. The Court has ruled against the separationist position in several key funding cases since &quot;Lee&quot;, including the school voucher case &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot;. However, a majority of the Court continues to maintain a strict ban on most forms of state-sponsored religious exercises in schools themselves, as evidenced by the 6–3 ruling in &quot;Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe&quot;, which struck down student-led prayers before public school football games.

<text>Honor Oak is an inner suburban area principally of the London Borough of Lewisham, with part in the London Borough of Southwark. It is named after the oak tree on One Tree Hill that Elizabeth I is reputed to have picnicked under.

==Overview==
One Tree Hill is the central feature of Honor Oak&#x27;s landscape. It is at the northern end of a string of hills stretching from Croydon, previously part of the Great North Wood. A legend tells that on 1 May 1602, Elizabeth I picnicked with Sir Richard Bulkeley of Beaumaris in the Lewisham area by an oak tree at the summit of a hill. The tree came to be known as the Oak of Honor. The tree surrounded by railings is an oak, and was planted in 1905 as a successor to the historic one. In addition to its connection with Queen Elizabeth I, the hill is reputedly the site of the final defeat of Queen Boudica by the Romans in 61AD, while Dick Turpin allegedly used it as a lookout post.

A new development of exclusive houses was started in the 1780s on what is now Honor Oak Road. This gave rise to both Honor Oak and Forest Hill, London communities. These localities have drifted about a mile apart North and South respectively since, aided by the arrival of a canal and then railways.

Between 1809 and 1836, a canal ran through Honor Oak as part of its route from New Cross to Croydon. It also went via Forest Hill and Sydenham. The canal was replaced by a railway line after 1836, and this now forms part of the line between London Bridge and Croydon. Honor Oak Park railway station opened in 1886 on this line. Honor Oak railway station was opened in 1862 but closed in 1958 as part of the closure of the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway, originally built to take passengers to The Crystal Palace. The remains of the embankment of this line can still be seen, forming part of Brenchley Gardens.

The beacon at the summit of One Tree Hill was erected to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of King George V in 1935. It was subsequently used for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, her silver and golden jubilees and also at the Millennium. Beacons on the same site were used to give warning of invasion by the Spanish and later the French. The Hill was also the site of Watson&#x27;s General Telegraph, a relay system established in 1841 linking London with shipping in the English Channel 

Honor Oak &amp; Forest Hill Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1893. The club disappeared at the time of WW2. This area is now Camberwell New Cemetery.

In 1896, One Tree Hill was due to become part of a golf club, but there were riots and demonstrations by local people. This fell through, and later it was bought by Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell and made into a public open space by 1905.

During World War I a gun emplacement was erected on the hill to counter the threat of raids by Zeppelin airships.

One part of the open space eventually became a nine-hole golf course called the Aquarius Golf Club. It lies on top of the cavernous Honor Oak Reservoir, constructed between 1901 and 1909. When it was completed the reservoir was the largest brick built underground reservoir in the world and even today remains one of the largest in Europe. The reservoir now forms part of the Southern extension of the Thames Water Ring Main.

The southern road bridge, which crosses the railway by the station, has relief sculpture parapets which were one of the first commissions for William Mitchell.

In 2010 Honor Oak Park railway station became part of the London Overground extension, providing residents with direct links into Shoreditch and Highbury and Islington. As with neighbouring Forest Hill, Honor Oak is becoming increasingly desirable as a peaceful, leafy suburb with good transport links into the centre of town, and slightly lower-than-average property prices.

The Architect Walter Segal worked with Lewisham council in the 1980&#x27;s in 2 self build schemes in the area, phase 2 is Walters Way ( phase 1 Segal Close is a little further away towards Catford). Buildings are featured in this website Celebration of Walter Segal buildings.

==Amenities and entertainment==
Honor Oak enjoys a number of well regarded restaurants, cafes, and pubs. 

These include the Babur Gourmet Indian Restaurant, described as &quot;one of the best Indian restaurants in London&quot; by &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, the Sardinian restaurant, Le Querce, Amrutha, a vegan restaurant, and a sourdough pizza restaurant, Miss Margherita. 

The high street has two cafes, The Oak Cafe and Two Spoons, which also opens as a cocktail bar in the evening. Grounds and Grapes is an all day bar and restaurant.

Local public houses are The Chandos, The General Napier, The Honor Oak and The Brockley Jack.

On the eastern side of One Tree Hill is a large allotment site called &quot;One Tree Hill Allotment Society&quot;, with views over towards Lewisham and Bromley. The site having over 100 plots and fairly long waiting list. Popular Open Day in September and occasional other public events. 

==Notable residents==

<doc id="943164" wikidata="Q2313010" url="?curid=943164" title="Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle">
<text>is a side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Sega for the Genesis. It is the only 16-bit platform game starring Alex Kidd, and the fifth game in the &quot;Alex Kidd&quot; of video games.

&quot;Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle&quot; follows Alex as he fights his way through the fictional planet Paperock in search of his long-lost father, King Thor. Alex has access to several items and vehicles that help him complete his quest, including a motorbike, a pedicopter and a pogo stick, which each give him unique abilities. While traveling through eleven worlds, Alex must defeat several opponents in rock paper scissors matches before finally finding King Thor.

==Gameplay==

The player guides Alex through eleven stages by fighting and avoiding enemies and obstacles. Alex can jump, kick, crawl or punch enemies, causing them to explode into gold coins, called Baums. New items and vehicles are gained by playing Janken (rock paper scissors) in gambling houses, including the Sukopako Motorcycle, the pedicopter (a small pedal-powered helicopter), a pogo stick and wizard cane which allows Alex to float in the air for a few seconds. One hit from any enemy causes Alex to die instantly.
In the original Japanese version of the game, when Alex or his opponent lose a Rock Paper Scissors match, the loser&#x27;s clothes disappear, leaving them naked with a fig leaf covering their genitalia. In the Western versions, the loser is flattened by a heavy weight. Several levels were also renamed for the Western release.

==Plot==
The plot continues that of &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot; (1986). Alex lives on Planet Aries which is ruled by his brother, King Igul. After hearing a rumor that his long-lost father, King Thor, is still alive on Planet Paperock, Alex travels to the planet to search for him.
==Reception and legacy==

The game received mixed reviews upon release. Later retrospective sources have given it mixed-to-negative reviews, with a rating of 47.5% from GameRankings. Lucas M. Thomas, reviewing the game for &quot;IGN&quot;, gave the game a 4.5/10, criticising the game&#x27;s &quot;floaty play control&quot; and the Rock, Paper, Scissors boss battles, lamenting: &quot;It&#x27;s all very random, and it&#x27;s not fun at all&quot;. Thomas also commented that &quot;You&#x27;ll understand why SEGA dropped [Alex Kidd]&quot;. Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; had similar problems with the game, also criticising the controls and stating that &quot;Alex slides around like his feet are coated with oil&quot;. Provo additionally disapproved of the game&#x27;s level design, calling it &quot;unremarkable&quot; and that &quot;the game&#x27;s 11 stages are short left-to-right strips peppered with the same rocks, trees, breakable bricks and generic enemies.&quot; He gave &quot;Enchanted Castle&quot; 3.8/10. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Dan Whitehead gave the game a 4/10, disliking the game&#x27;s &quot;abominable collision detection&quot; and &quot;infantile effort&quot;. Like Thomas, he was dissatisfied with the game&#x27;s Rock, Paper, Scissors sections, observing that &quot;victory comes from blind luck, you&#x27;ll sit there ... hoping the law of averages means you&#x27;ll eventually choose the right option and escape from this &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; gaming hell&quot;. MegaTech gave a review score of 68% and commenting that the game&#x27;s graphics and sound are almost Master System standard and saying it&#x27;s fun to play it does not have the same addictive spark like its predecessors. They recommend the game for &quot;Alex Kidd&quot; fans. &quot;Console XS&quot; gave a score of 72%, writing: &quot;This platform adventure has loads of games and is packed with average selection of adversaries but the whole thing gets very boring.&quot;
&quot;Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle&quot; has been included in a variety of Mega Drive game compilations for newer platforms. The game is part of the &quot;Sega Mega Drive Collection&quot; (known in America as the &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot;) for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable and was also released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console on April 9, 2007, in North America and May 4, 2007, in Europe. The game later appeared in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection / Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game is also included in the second volume of &quot;Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection&quot; for PC, as well as in the box set of all volumes, &quot;Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection: Gold Edition.&quot; The game is also available as a standalone unit on the Arcade Legends Sega Genesis Volume 2 plug and play joypad, released by Radica, and the Sega Mega Drive Handheld, a portable game console containing twenty games. It has also been released for Microsoft Windows on Steam individually and as part of &quot;Sega Genesis Classics Pack 2&quot;, and included in the console releases of the same series, &quot;Sega Genesis Classics&quot;. It is also one of the 42 games pre-installed in the Sega Genesis Mini console.

<text>A kitten heel is a type of stiletto heel that is generally less than 5 cm (2 inches) in height, featuring a slight curve that sets the heel in from the back edge of the shoe. The design offers a more comfortable and practical alternative to traditional high heels while maintaining a feminine aesthetic. The style gained prominence in the 1960s, largely due to the influence of fashion icons like Audrey Hepburn, who helped popularize kitten heels as a fashionable yet functional choice.

Kitten heels experienced a resurgence in popularity in the early 2000s, thanks in part to high-profile wearers such as Theresa May, Michelle Obama, and Hillary Clinton, all of whom adopted the shoe for its blend of elegance and comfort. Their versatility allows them to be worn in professional settings or for more formal occasions by those who find traditional high heels uncomfortable but still want to achieve a sophisticated look.

Kitten heels are defined by their tapered heel, typically measuring between 2.5 and 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) in height. Unlike the taller stiletto heel, which can reach up to 12.5 centimeters (5 inches), kitten heels offer a lower and more stable alternative, while still maintaining the signature slender look of high-heeled footwear.

==History==

Kitten heels first appeared in the late 1950s, initially designed for young adolescent girls as a more modest option compared to the taller stiletto heels. At the time, high heels were considered inappropriate for young girls, but kitten heels offered a way for them to wear fashionable shoes without compromising on practicality or modesty. These shoes were often referred to as &quot;trainer heels&quot; in the United States, serving as an introduction to wearing high heels.

By the early 1960s, kitten heels had become a staple of women’s fashion, embraced by older teenagers and adult women alike. The style&#x27;s popularity faded in the late 1960s as stiletto heels became the dominant trend in footwear. However, the resurgence of interest in retro fashion in the 1980s, coupled with the rise of wedge heels, brought kitten heels back into the fashion spotlight.

In the 2000s, kitten heels made another comeback, largely driven by their appearance on the fashion runways and in popular culture. Their resurgence was fueled in part by the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, which celebrated a wide range of feminine footwear. By the 2010s, the style continued to evolve, with variations like the &quot;kit-flop,&quot; a hybrid of flip-flops and kitten heels, becoming trendy.

==Cultural Significance==
Kitten heels are often favored by women who require a professional yet stylish look. Despite their lower height, kitten heels are associated with femininity and elegance. Their adoption by prominent political figures, including Theresa May and Michelle Obama, underscores their enduring appeal in settings that demand both comfort and sophistication.

<text>Thames () () is a town at the southwestern end of the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located on the Firth of Thames close to the mouth of the Waihou River. The town is the seat of the Thames-Coromandel District Council. The Māori iwi are Ngāti Maru, who are descendants of Marutuahu&#x27;s son Te Ngako. Ngāti Maru is part of the Ngati Marutuahu confederation of tribes or better known as Hauraki Iwi.

Thames had an estimated population of 15,000 in 1870, but this declined to 4,500 in 1881, and it has increased modestly since. It is still the biggest town on the Coromandel Peninsula. Until 2016, a historical oak tree that was planted by Governor George Grey stood on the corner of Grey and Rolleston streets.

==History and culture==
=== Māori history ===

In the early 19th century the area was populated by Ngāti Maru and other members of the Marutūāhu collective. Ngāti Maru built a large fortified pā between the Kauaeranga River and Waihou River, known as Te Tōtara. In December 1821, this pā was attacked by a Te Tai Tokerau Māori taua (war party) during the Musket Wars. After a frontal assault was unsuccessful, the taua took the pā by stealth.

=== European settlement ===
Thames was formed from two historic towns, Grahamstown and Shortland, of which many original buildings still stand. Shortland was to the south of Thames and was founded on 27 July 1867 when James Mackay, civil commissioner for the Hauraki District, concluded an agreement with local Māori. The land was rented for mining purposes for the sum of £5,000 per year, a colossal sum in the mid 19th century. This agreement secured the rights to local mineral deposits leading to the proclamation of the Thames Goldfield on 1 August. The leasing of the land for such a huge income was a source of great envy by other Maori iwi and hapu.

Grahamstown was founded the following year at the northern end of present Thames, approximately one mile from Shortland. The two towns merged in 1874 after it emerged the heart of the Goldfield was in Grahamstown. Shortland waned in importance until the turn of the century when the Hauraki Plains were developed for farming and the Shortland railway station was opened.

=== Gold rush ===
The town was initially built during a gold rush, with the first major discovery of gold being made on 10 August 1867 by William Hunt, in the Kuranui Stream at the north end of Thames. The subsequent mine produced more than 102,353oz bullion and was known as the Shotover. The era from 1868 to 1871 were the bonanza years for the town with gold production topping one million pounds sterling at its peak. Official figures for production of the Thames Mines recorded a yield of 2,327,619oz bullion with the value at $845 million. The three richest fields were the Manukau / Golden Crown / Caledonian mines but many others yielded near equivalent amounts. Thames had an estimated population of 15,000 in 1870 which would make it one of the largest cities in New Zealand at the time, but the population had declined to 11,950 (not including Māori) in the 1871 census. The Māori population was 1,428 in 1859. After the gold began to diminish, so did Thames&#x27; population, dropping to 5,420 in 1878 and 4,563 in 1881. Thames also benefited from a period of extensive Kauri logging in the surrounding ranges around the same time.

The land involved in goldmining in Thames was Māori-owned; important parts of the goldfield were owned by the Ngāti Maru rangatira (chief) Rapana Maunganoa and the Taipari family. In 1878, when Wiremu Hōterene Taipari married a woman of the Ngāti Awa tribe of Whakatāne, Ngāti Awa carvers arrived at Thames and built a meeting house at Pārāwai. It is incorrectly said to have been a wedding gift for the couple when actually Wiremu&#x27;s father had paid money for another whare (meeting house), which was sold to the governor general at the time. When Wiremu&#x27;s father returned to collect the whare the Ngati Awa chief apologised and said he would have another one built which would signify the marriage between Wiremu Taipari and his daughter. The house, named Hotunui in honour of an important Ngāti Maru ancestor, now stands in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

=== Recent history ===
The Carters - Kopu sawmill, 9 km south of Thames, closed in 2008 with the loss of 145 jobs. In 2012, mayor of Thames-Coromandel called NZTA safety procedures into question when a sink hole on State Highway 25 north of Thames, opened above an old mine shaft.

===Marae===

The Mātai Whetū Marae is located in Kopu. It is a meeting ground for Ngāti Maru and features Te Rama o Hauraki meeting house.

===Treasury===
Operating since 2009, The Treasury is an archive and research centre located in the town. The book &quot;True Tales of Thames&quot; was launched at The Treasury by The Coromandel Heritage Trust.

=== Steampunk ===

Steampunk has been a community-supported festival in Thames since 2015.

==Local government==

The area was initially controlled by the Auckland Provincial Council. In late 1871, a public meeting in Grahamstown resolved:

That in the opinion of the meeting it is desirable that a Municipal Corporation should be established for the Thames.

This resulted in the forming of a Thames Municipality Committee in early 1872. The Borough of Thames was gazetted in November 1873. The first Borough Council was elected in March 1874. As was practice at the time, the councillors voted one from their midst to be the mayor. William Davies was the only person proposed and voted into the role unanimously in April 1874.

During the 1870s, Governor George Grey represented Thames in the New Zealand Parliament.

In total, there were 24 Mayors of Thames Borough. In 1975, Thames Borough amalgamated with Coromandel County, out of which Thames-Coromandel District arose. Hence, the role was succeeded by that of the Mayor of Thames-Coromandel.

==Economy==

Thames Hospital is the oldest still operating in New Zealand, having been built in the 1860s. The Māori owned land was donated by the Ngāti Maru rangatira Rapana Maunganoa. A new clinical centre and other improvements were completed in 2008, and a new maternity facility opened on 5 September 2011. The Thames Jockey Club was one of the earliest to be established in New Zealand.

The Thames Aerodrome is 3 km south of the town. Regular flights to Auckland are operated by Great Barrier Airlines. A major employer is the Toyota New Zealand plant, which assembled CKD cars until 1998, and now refurbishes imported used cars. Another is the precision engineering works and foundry of A &amp; G Price, established 1868, who built 123 steam locomotives for New Zealand Railways Department. The Brian Boru Hotel, built in 1868, is the oldest Irish pub in New Zealand. Most shops are located on Pollen Street. Goldfields Shopping Centre is a major shopping mall in Thames. Many residents work in tourism and locally owned businesses servicing the local farming community. Thames has also been used as a filming location for movies including &quot;Falling Inn Love&quot; and &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;.

== Transport ==

=== Port ===
Initially the main access to Thames was by sea, with goods and passengers landed on the beach. Shortland Wharf was built in 1868 and remains in use. Thames Harbour Board controlled the port from 1876 until it was merged with the Town Council in 1936. By then competition, following the opening of the railway in 1898 and then the Hauraki (now Kopu) Bridge in 1928, had reduced the profitability of the wharves and a commissioner had been appointed, as the town couldn&#x27;t meet its debts.

Ships which have served Thames have included SS Go Ahead and Northern Steamship Co&#x27;s Terranora (1898), Kapui (1911) and Waipu (1928).

=== Railway ===
The Thames branch railway connecting the town with Hamilton was opened in 1898 and was closed in 1991 and the tracks were taken up, though Thames railway station remains. The branch now provides part of the course for the Hauraki Rail Trail.

=== Road ===
Thames is on SH25.

==== Bus ====
Thames Connector buses run 5 times a day between Tararu and Parawai. Go Kiwi operate a shuttle bus from the east coast of Coromandel, via Thames, to Auckland. InterCity run twice a day between Auckland and Tauranga via Thames.

==Education==
Thames High School is a secondary (years 9–13) school with a decile rating of 5 and a roll of . The school was established in 1880 and is the second oldest secondary school in the Auckland Province.

<text>Springhill mining disaster may refer to any of three deadly Canadian mining disasters that occurred in 1891, 1956, and 1958 in different mines within the Springhill coalfield, near the town of Springhill in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. In the 1891 accident, 125 died; in 1956, 39 were killed; and in 1958, 75 miners were killed.

The mines in the Springhill coalfield were established in the 19th century, and by the early 1880s were being worked by the Cumberland Coal &amp; Railway Company Ltd. and the Springhill &amp; Parrsboro Coal &amp; Railway Company Ltd. These entities merged in 1884 to form the Cumberland Railway &amp; Coal Company Ltd., which its investors sold in 1910 to the industrial conglomerate Dominion Coal Company Ltd. (DOMCO). Following the third disaster in 1958, the operator Dominion Steel &amp; Coal Corporation Ltd. (DOSCO), then a subsidiary of the A.V. Roe Canada Company Ltd., shut its mining operations in Springhill, and they were never reopened. the mine properties, among the deepest works in the world, with the No. 2 mine reaching and now filled with water, are owned by the government of Nova Scotia, and provide Springhill&#x27;s industrial park with geothermal heating.

==1891 explosion==
Springhill&#x27;s first mining disaster, the 1891 explosion, killed 125 miners, some of them child laborers between 10 and 13 years old. It occurred at approximately 12:30 pm on February 21, 1891, in the Number 1 and Number 2 collieries, which were joined by a connecting tunnel at the level (below the surface). A fire caused by accumulated coal dust swept through both shafts.

Rescue efforts throughout that afternoon and evening were made easier by the lack of fire in No. 1 and No. 2, but the scale of the disaster was unprecedented in Nova Scotian or Canadian mining history, and the subsequent relief funds saw contributions come in from across the country and the British Empire, including Queen Victoria.

A subsequent inquiry determined that sufficient gas detectors in working order had been present in the two collieries; however, the ignition source of the explosion was never determined, despite investigators having pinpointed its general location.

The song &quot;La Mine&quot; (allegedly traditional) by the French Canadian folk group Le Vent du Nord on their 2009 album &quot;La part du feu &quot; relates to the 1891 explosion.

==1956 explosion==
The 1956 explosion occurred on November 1, and killed 39 coal miners, but 88 others underground were rescued because of improved equipment. Prior to the blast, a mine train was hauling a load of fine coal dust up to the surface of the Number 4 colliery for removal from the pithead, and encountered a heavy flow of ventilation air being forced down the shaft by surface fans. The flow of air disturbed the contents of the ascending train cars and spread fine (and highly flammable) dust throughout the air of the shafts of No. 4. Before the train reached the surface, several cars broke loose and ran back down the slope of No. 4, derailing along the way and hitting a power line, causing it to arc and igniting the coal dust at the level (below surface).

The resulting explosion blew coal dust up the slope to the surface where the additional oxygen created a huge blast, which leveled the bankhead on the surface – where the coal is hauled out from the mine in an angled shaft into a vertical building (the coal is then dropped into railway cars). Most of the devastation was sustained by the surface buildings, but many miners were trapped in the shaft along with the derailed train cars and fallen support timbers and other items damaged by the explosion.

Heroically, Drägermen (rescue miners with breathing equipment) and barefaced miners (without such protection) entered the No. 4 to aid their colleagues. International media coverage of the 1956 explosion was largely overshadowed by the Soviet invasion of Hungary and the Suez Crisis, which happened at about the same time. Nevertheless, Canadian and local media gave extensive coverage to the 1956 disaster. After the rescue effort, the connected No. 4 and No. 2 collieries were sealed for several months to deprive the fires of oxygen. In January 1957, the bodies of the remaining casualties were recovered from the pit, and No. 4 colliery closed forever. One of the rescuers, physician Arnold Burden, was also involved in the 1958 disaster.

==1958 bump==
=== The events ===
The 1958 bump killed 75 miners on October 23, 1958, out of 174 working at the No. 2 colliery. The accident was the most severe &quot;bump&quot; (underground seismic event) in North American mining history, injured Springhill residents, and devastated the town&#x27;s economy.

Springhill&#x27;s No. 2 colliery was one of the deepest coal mines in the world. Sloping shafts in length led to a vast labyrinth of galleries more than below the surface. Mining techniques there had been changed 20 years before the 1958 bump, from &quot;room and pillar&quot; to &quot;long wall retreating&quot; after reports had shown the increased danger of &quot;bump&quot; phenomena resulting from the former technique.

On October 23 a small bump occurred at 7:00 pm during the evening shift; it was ignored, as this was a somewhat common occurrence. However, just over an hour later, at 8:06 pm, an enormous bump &quot;severely impacted the middle of the three walls that were being mined and the ends of the four levels nearest the walls&quot;.

The bump spread as three distinct shock waves, resembling a small earthquake throughout the region, alerting residents on the surface over a wide area to the disaster. &quot;Dräger&quot; teams and teams of barefaced miners entered No. 2 colliery to begin the rescue effort. They encountered survivors at the level walking or limping toward the surface. Gas released by the bump was encountered in increasing concentrations at the level where the ceiling had collapsed, and rescuers were forced to work down shafts that were in a partial state of collapse or were blocked completely by debris.

Of the 174 miners in No. 2 colliery at the time of the bump, those who were not located either in side galleries, or some other shelter, were immediately crushed, the coal galleries and faces being completely destroyed. However, 75 survivors were on the surface by 4:00 am on October 24, 1958, and rescue teams continued working to find 24 others, but the number of rockfalls and the amount of debris slowed progress.

Meanwhile, the Canadian and international news media had made their way to Springhill. Arnie Patterson was the public relations spokesman for the Company, and relayed news of the progress of rescue (and later recovery) to the families of the miners and to reporters. The disaster became famous for being the first major international event to appear in live television broadcasts (on the CBC). As the world waited and those on the surface kept their vigil, rescuers continued to toil below ground trying to reach trapped survivors. Teams began to arrive from other coal mines in Cumberland County, on Cape Breton Island and in Pictou County.

After five and a half days (therefore around the morning of Wednesday, October 29, 1958), contact was established with a group of 12 survivors on the other side of a rockfall. A rescue tunnel was dug; it broke through to the trapped miners at 2:25 am on Thursday, October 30, 1958.

On Friday, October 31, 1958, the rescue site was visited by various dignitaries, including the Premier of Nova Scotia, Robert Stanfield, and His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh who had been at meetings in Ottawa.

On Saturday, November 1, 1958, another group of survivors was found. None were found thereafter. Instead, bodies of the dead were hauled out in airtight aluminum coffins, on account of the advanced stage of decomposition, accelerated by the Earth&#x27;s heat in the depths of No. 2 mine at below the mine entrance.

=== The aftermath ===

The 1958 bump had profound and long-lasting effects on the town and on the public imagination.

In the media crush at the pithead (the shaft entrance at the surface), reporters rushed to speak with survivors, particularly the two groups of miners who had been trapped until Thursday and Sunday respectively. When asked what he wanted most, survivor Douglas Jewkes replied, &quot;A 7 Up&quot;. Following this high-profile media event and unexpected &quot;plug&quot;, the 7 Up company hired him as a spokesman.

Several miners and their rescuers were invited onto &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. One miner, Maurice Ruddick, was chosen as Canada&#x27;s &quot;Citizen of the Year&quot;. Ruddick and the other &quot;miracle miners&quot; enjoyed public attention for a brief time after their rescue. For Ruddick, the only black man in the group, racism dimmed his moment in the spotlight. An aide to the Democratic Governor of the U.S. state of Georgia Marvin Griffin took advantage of the intense media coverage to promote tourism to that state by offering a group of survivors free vacations to Jekyll Island. However to the segregationist governor&#x27;s chagrin (he had been vacationing on a hunting trip in Manitoba at the time of the disaster), he learned of Ruddick&#x27;s racewhich resulted in a public relations nightmare. Upon learning that Ruddick was black, the governor said that Ruddick would have to be segregated. Ruddick agreed to the governor&#x27;s terms so that the other miners&#x27; vacations would not be ruined; but he and his family stayed in a trailer apart from his colleagues. Ruddick died in 1988. In 2003, U.S. author Melissa Fay Greene retold this aspect of the aftermath in her book &quot;Last Man Out&quot;.

The rescuers were awarded a Gold Medal by the Royal Canadian Humane Association for bravery in lifesaving, the first time the medal had been awarded to a group. In 1958, the town of Springhill was awarded the Carnegie Medal for Heroism recognizing the community involvement needed to save the surviving miners. , Springhill is the only community to have received that award, usually reserved for individual acts of heroism.

=== Representations in popular culture ===
; In music
* On November 7, 1958 (a week after the last survivors were rescued from The Bump), bluegrass musician Bill Clifton recorded &quot;Springhill Disaster&quot;, a song that he adapted from a poem written by the celebrated survivor, Maurice Ruddick.
* American folksinger Peggy Seeger and English folksinger Ewan MacColl composed the song &quot;The Ballad of Springhill&quot; about the 1958 disaster. It was originally performed by MacColl and Seeger as an &quot;a cappella&quot; duet in 1959. They sang the song at the 1960 Newport Folk Festival with guitar accompaniment. It was subsequently sung by popular folk revival group Peter, Paul and Mary. In 1987, Irish rock band U2 drew attention to the disaster when they included &quot;The Ballad of Springhill&quot; in the playlist for their Joshua Tree Tour. U2 performed the song at fifteen concerts, and were televised live in 1988. U2&#x27;s lyrics have sometimes been misheard, with people thinking that Bono sang &quot;late in the year of 88&quot;; when in fact he sang &quot;laid in the earth are 88&quot;, referring to the number of those who died (in fact: 75 died in the 1958 bump, but 88 were rescued after the 1956 explosion). On July 30, 2011, U2 performed the first verse of the song during the final show on their 360° Tour in Moncton, New Brunswick. In an interview after the 1987 performance on a 25th anniversary television tribute to the Irish band The Dubliners, Bono said that the first recording of &quot;The Ballad of Springhill&quot; he heard was that by Irish folk singer Luke Kelly, a member of The Dubliners. Peggy Seeger came to Springhill in 2008, where she sang the song on the 50th anniversary of the bump. Other recordings of the song include those by English folk musician Martin Carthy on his 1965 self-titled debut album as “Springhill Mine Disaster”; Irish musician Pauline Scanlon on her début album &quot;Red Colour Sun&quot;, featuring Damien Dempsey, as &quot;The Springhill Mining Disaster&quot;; and Canadian rapper/producer Socalled on his 2011 album &quot;Sleepover&quot;.
* Canadian folk group Tanglefoot refer to the 1958 bump in their song &quot;Hard Work&quot; on their 2006 album &quot;Dance Like Flames&quot;.
* In 2008, Brian Vardigans wrote a song entitled &quot;Springhill&quot; that was sung at the 50th anniversary ceremonies for the victims of the 1958 bump on October 23, 2008.
* In 2023, Adam Baldwin wrote a song entitled &quot;No. 2 Colliery&quot; as part of his album &quot;Concertos and Serenades&quot; which includes ballads about the working man’s trials and tribulations on the East Coast.

; In literature
* Leonard Lerner&#x27;s 1960 book &quot;Miracle at Springhill&quot; is about the 1958 bump.
* Richard Brautigan wrote a poem entitled &quot;The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster&quot;, published in 1968, about the 1958 bump.
* On the CBC Radio show &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;, host Stuart McLean tells one of his popular &quot;Dave and Morley&quot; fictitious stories from the perspective of Dave&#x27;s mother and the tale of how Dave&#x27;s uncle died in the 1958 disaster.
* Alistair MacLeod&#x27;s short story &quot;The Vastness of the Dark&quot; features the narrator passing through Springhill in 1960, and recalling the disasters and the efforts of his mining community to retrieve the survivors.
*In 2003 Melissa Fay Greene wrote &quot;Last Man Out: the Story of the Springhill Mine Disaster&quot;, a riveting biographical reconstruction based on survivor interviews.
* A 2014 book by Cheryl McKay, &quot;Spirit of Springhill: Miners, Wives, Widows, Rescuers and Their Children Tell True Stories of Springhill&#x27;s Coal Mining Disasters&quot;, relates to the 1956 explosion, to the 1957 Main Street fire, and to the 1958 bump.
* A 2014 fictionalized novel by Cheryl McKay, &quot;Song of Springhill – A Love Story: An Inspirational Romance Based on Historical Events&quot; relates to the 1958 bump. The character of Isaak Revere in the novel is based on Maurice Ruddick.

; In film
* The disaster is indirectly referenced in the Disney 1961 animated film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;. After the puppies are stolen, there is an image of a newspaper front page; under the headline &quot;15 puppies are dognapped from home&quot;, there is an account of the 1958 bump.

<text>Margaret Leslie &quot;Molly&quot; Johnson, OC is a Canadian singer of pop and jazz.

==Biography==
Johnson began as a child performer, receiving formal training from the National Ballet School and the Banff School of Fine Arts. Johnson&#x27;s brother Clark Johnson, an actor and director (&quot;&quot;, &quot;The Wire&quot;), and sister Taborah Johnson, an actor and singer, are also noted Canadian performers.

Raised in Toronto, Ontario, as the child of a white mother and a black father, Johnson started her career in the mid-1960s when, as a young grade schooler, she and her brother were tapped by Toronto producer Ed Mirvish to appear in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; at the Royal Alexandra Theatre. In time &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; was followed by &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and other musicals. The budding child star was soon enrolled the National Ballet School as she desired to become a choreographer. By the age of 17, Johnson was fronting a disco band named A Chocolate Affair. The group lasted just over a year.

She was lead vocalist for two rock bands, Alta Moda in the 1980s and Infidels in the 1990s. Both of her bands had notable singles in Canada (Alta Moda&#x27;s &quot;Julian&quot; and Infidels&#x27; &quot;100 Watt Bulb&quot; and &quot;Celebrate&quot;), but both bands broke up after just one album each.

Also in 1980s, she performed as a backing vocalist with Toronto group Breeding Ground, most notably on their singles &quot;Happy Now I Know&quot; and &quot;Ceremony of Love&quot;, both of which received consistent college radio airplay, and had rotation on MuchMusic. She also performed with them live whenever her commitments with Alta Moda weren&#x27;t in conflict. In 1989, she performed the song &quot;The Best We Both Can Be&quot; for the film &quot;&quot;, and also provided voice work for &quot;Babar and the Adventures of Badou&quot; in 2010.

Beginning in 1993, Johnson established an annual concert series, the Kumbaya Festival as a benefit for Canadian charities working around HIV and AIDS. She helped to raise over $1 million for people living with AIDS/HIV.

Although she has performed as a jazz singer throughout her career, beginning with Aaron Davis and David Piltch in the band Blue Monday and then with a band of backing musicians who would later become prominent in their own right as Big Sugar, she did not release a jazz album until her self-titled solo debut in 2000. She followed up with &quot;Another Day&quot; (2003). Both albums were well received at home and went on to be successful in France, where she continues to tour. In 2006 she released her third solo album &quot;Messin&#x27; Around&quot;.

Johnson became the first Canadian female vocalist in the Toronto Downtown Jazz Festival&#x27;s 17-year history to sell out a show on the mainstage. She has performed aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia before the Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and has performed for Nelson Mandela and Quincy Jones. She has been the subject of various media feature stories, including &quot;Adrienne Clarkson Presents&quot;, June Callwood&#x27;s &quot;National Treasures&quot;, and Bravo!&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Rehearsal Hall&quot;.

In 2007, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. On March 8, 2023, the French government bestowed upon her the Chevalier dans l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres on the occasion of International Women&#x27;s Day during a ceremony presided by French Ambassador to Canada, Michel Miraillet and hosted by Tudor Alexis, Consul General of France in Toronto. 

Johnson was the weekend host of CBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Radio 2 Morning&quot; from September 2008 until December 2013.

On November 11, 2008, Johnson released her fourth full-length album, a record of standards entitled &quot;Lucky&quot;, via Universal Music Canada and Universal Music France. In March 2009 &quot;Lucky&quot; took home the Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year.

She is currently working on The Black History Project: Canada - an initiative she has started to update Canadian history to include its impact and involvement with regards to Black Canadian history and the Underground Railroad.

<text>Génies en herbe (&quot;Budding Geniuses&quot;) was a Radio-Canada television program in which students representing their &quot;école secondaire&quot; (Quebec high schools) participated in trivia tournaments. Tournaments also took place in French-speaking communities outside Quebec, such as Saint Boniface, Manitoba. &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; is an English Canadian equivalent. It was the French Canadian equivalent to the US and international game show &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;.

After the end of the TV series, the tournaments continued under the aegis of several regional school organizations.

In January 2011, the show was started once more on Radio-Canada in a pan-Canadian format. This newer version was called &quot;Génies en herbe: l&#x27;aventure&quot; (&quot;Budding Geniuses: Adventure&quot;) in which four teams travel around Canada to discover seven different cities. The quiz was then heavily oriented on the culture and history of the cities visited in the current episode. The four teams are the Maritimes, Ontario, Quebec and Western Canada.

<doc id="943281" wikidata="Q4710558" url="?curid=943281" title="Albert Jacka">
<text>Albert Jacka, (10 January 1893 – 17 January 1932) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Jacka was the first Australian to be decorated with the VC during the First World War, receiving the medal for his actions during the Gallipoli Campaign. He later served on the Western Front and was twice more decorated for his bravery.

After the war, Jacka returned to Australia and entered business, establishing the electrical goods importing and exporting business &quot;Roxburgh, Jacka &amp; Co. Pty Ltd&quot;. He was later elected to the local council, becoming mayor of the City of St Kilda. Jacka never fully recovered from the wounds he sustained during his war service, and died aged 39.

==Early life==
Albert Jacka was born on a dairy farm near Winchelsea, Victoria, on 10 January 1893, the fourth of seven children to Nathaniel Jacka and his English-born wife Elizabeth (née Kettle). His family moved to Wedderburn, Victoria, when he was five years old, where he attended the local school before working with his father as a haulage contractor. He was working for the Victorian State Forests Department at Heathcote when the First World War broke out. His career over three years took him along the southern side of the Murray River to Wedderburn, Cohuna, Koondrook, Lake Charm and Heathcote. His work included fencing, fire break clearing and tree planting. Jacka is one of twenty employees shown on the Forests Department Roll of Honour.

==First World War==
===Enlistment and training===
Jacka enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 18 September 1914, with the rank of private. He was assigned to the 14th Battalion, 4th Brigade, 1st Division and finished his training at Broadmeadows Camp.

After Turkey became a German ally, the 1st Division was sent to Egypt to defend the Suez Canal. Jacka and his battalion arrived at Alexandria on 31 January 1915. During ten weeks of training south of Cairo the 4th Brigade was merged with two New Zealand brigades and merged with the 1st Light Horse Brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division (NZ&amp;A) under Major General Alexander Godley.

===Gallipoli===

Jacka fought in the Gallipoli campaign that started on 25 April 1915, when his new division landed at Anzac Cove on the 26th in the Dardanelles, fighting against Turkish defenders on a narrow beach and in the steep ravines and hills above. The position was held by New Zealanders and Australians by digging a series of trenches. The trenches held by the 14th Battalion on 19 May 1915 became known as Courtney&#x27;s Post, which was where Jacka won the Victoria Cross.

On 19 May 1915, the Turks launched an assault against the Anzac Line, capturing a section of the trench at Courtney&#x27;s Post; one end of which was guarded by Jacka. For several minutes he fired warning shots into the trench wall until reinforcements arrived, after which he attempted to enter the trench with three others; all but Jacka were either wounded or pinned. It was then decided that while a feint attack was made from the same end, Jacka would attack from the rear. The party then proceeded to engage the Turks with rifle fire, throwing in two bombs as Jacka skirted around to attack from the flank. He climbed out onto &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;, entering the trench via the parapet. In the resulting conflict, Jacka shot five Turkish soldiers and bayoneted two others, forcing the remainder to flee the trench; he then held the trench alone for the remainder of the night. Jacka&#x27;s platoon commander, Lieutenant Crabbe, informed him the following morning that he would be recommended for his bravery.

The full citation for the Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 23 July 1915:

Following his VC action, Jacka instantly became a national hero; he received the £500 and gold watch that the prominent Melbourne business and sporting identity, John Wren, had promised to the first Australian of the war to receive the VC, his image was used on recruiting posters and magazine covers, and he received rapid promotions; first to corporal on 28 August, to sergeant two weeks later on 12 September, and then to company sergeant major on 14 November. He became company sergeant major of C Company, and saw much fighting at Gallipoli where, during August at Chunuk Bair, Hill 971, and Hill 60, his battalion took part in an Allied offensive aimed at trying to break the deadlock around the beachhead. After nine months of fighting and 26,111 Australian casualties, the Allied forces began to evacuate the peninsula in December 1915, after which Jacka&#x27;s battalion was withdrawn to Egypt.

In Egypt, he passed through officer training school with high marks, and on 29 April 1916 was commissioned as a second lieutenant. During this time, the AIF expanded and was reorganised; the 14th Battalion was split and provided experienced soldiers for the 46th Battalion, and the 4th Brigade was combined with the 12th and 13th Brigades to form the 4th Australian Division.

===Western Front===
The division was sent to France, and the Western Front, in June 1916, where Jacka and his unit were assigned to the Allied trenches near Armentières, participating in several raids against the German trenches. Following the heavy casualties on the Somme, the 14th Battalion was transferred to the Pozières sector of the Somme offensive. Jacka&#x27;s division, on 23 July 1916, was involved in the attack of Pozières planned by Major General Harold Bridgwood Walker. The Australian division suffered 5,285 casualties after three days of fighting. The Australian force captured Pozières, but the fight was so bloody that the Australians could only identify their trenches by the bodies of their comrades showing their red-and-white shoulder patches.

On the morning of 7 August 1916, after a night of heavy shelling, the Germans began to overrun a portion of the line which included Jacka&#x27;s dug-out. Jacka had just completed a reconnaissance, and had gone to his dug-out when two Germans appeared at its entrance and rolled a bomb down the doorway, killing two of his men. Emerging from the dug-out, Jacka came upon a large number of Germans rounding up some forty Australians as prisoners. Only seven men from his platoon had recovered from the blast; rallying these few, he charged at the enemy. Heavy hand-to-hand fighting ensued, as the Australian prisoners turned on their captors. Every member of the platoon was wounded, including Jacka who was wounded seven times; including an injury from a bullet that passed through his body under his right shoulder, and two head wounds. Fifty Germans were captured and the line was retaken; Jacka was personally credited with killing between twelve and twenty Germans during the engagement.

Jacka was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his actions at Pozières, although he was originally recommended for the Distinguished Service Order. The citation for his MC reads as follows:

Many present at the time, as well as many historians since, have voiced the opinion that Jacka deserved a second VC for the Pozières action. One of only two bars (second award) to the VC awarded during the war was earned the following day by Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse of the Royal Army Medical Corps. Chavasse subsequently died of wounds sustained during this second VC action. The other bar to the VC was earned by Arthur Martin-Leake during the period 29 October to 8 November 1914 near Zonnebeke, Belgium, when, according to his award citation, Martin-Leake showed most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty in rescuing, while exposed to constant fire, a large number of the wounded who were lying close to the enemy&#x27;s trenches. Martin-Leake was the first of only three men to be awarded a bar to his VC.

Although traditionally the reason Jacka was not awarded a bar to his VC has been ascribed to British snobbery towards a &quot;rough colonial&quot;, this view has been challenged. Gordon Corrigan, in &quot;Blood Mud and Poppycock&quot;, points out that it was Jacka&#x27;s Australian superiors who chose not to recommend him for the award, and he argues that this may have been due to the fact that the Germans easily infiltrated Jacka&#x27;s platoon position in broad daylight without being challenged. The sentries were most likely asleep or absent and Jacka should have ensured that they were not; as such it may have been perceived that while Jacka should be commended for his robust action in responding to the situation, he also bore a responsibility for allowing it to happen in the first place.

After the incident, Jacka was evacuated to England, where he was promoted to lieutenant on 18 August 1916, but was falsely reported dead on 8 September. He attended an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle on 29 September; receiving his Victoria Cross from King George V, before rejoining his unit in November. Promoted to captain on 15 March 1917, he was appointed the 14th Battalion&#x27;s intelligence officer.

By early 1917, the Germans had retired to the Hindenburg Line, and on 8 April Jacka led a night reconnaissance party into &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;, near Bullecourt to inspect enemy defences before an Allied attack against the new German line. He penetrated the wire at two places, reported back, then went out again to supervise the laying of tapes to guide the assault parties; in the process he single-handedly captured a two-man German patrol. He was awarded a Bar to his MC for this action. The bar&#x27;s citation reads as follows:

Later, Jacka was given command of D Company, 14th Battalion, and in June led his men through the Battle for Messines Ridge. During their advance, the company overran several machine gun posts and captured a German field gun; Jacka&#x27;s actions went unrecognised. On 8 July, he was wounded by a sniper near Ploegsteert Wood, resulting in nearly two months hospitalisation. Returning to the front, he led the 14th Battalion on 26 September in an attack against German pill-boxes during the Battle of Polygon Wood. Jacka was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order a second time for this feat, but again it was not granted. In May 1918, Jacka was finally removed from the conflict when, outside the village of Villers-Bretonneux, he was badly gassed and a missile passed through his trachea. He was evacuated to No. 20 Casualty Clearing Station at Vignacourt, where it was thought that he would not recover. When he did, he was sent to Britain for two operations and a long recuperative period.

He returned to Australia on 6 September 1919 and his AIF appointment ended on 10 January 1920, when he returned to Melbourne to a hero&#x27;s welcome.

==Later life==

After the war, Jacka had a job waiting for him with the Forests Department, but together with R. O. Roxburgh and E. J. L. Edmonds, both former members of the 14th Battalion, he established the electrical goods importing and exporting business &quot;Roxburgh, Jacka &amp; Co. Pty Ltd&quot;. The business was heavily financed by John Wren, but collapsed with the Great Depression in 1931.

On 17 January 1921, at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, St Kilda, Jacka married Frances Veronica Carey, a typist from his office. The pair settled in St. Kilda, and later adopted a daughter, Betty. In September, 1929, he was elected to the Council of the City of St Kilda, becoming mayor the following year. Much of his civic work was characterised by his strong interest in assisting the unemployed, defending evictees and proposing public works for the &#x27;sussos&#x27;: &#x27;sustenance workers&#x27;, employed on public works by the Government as a relief measure.

On 14 December 1931, Jacka collapsed after a council meeting and was admitted to Caulfield Military Hospital. On 17 January 1932, one week after his 39th birthday, he died from chronic nephritis; he was buried at St Kilda Cemetery, with eight other Victoria Cross recipients acting as pallbearers and an estimated 6,000 witnesses to the burial as his body passed en route to the cemetery.

Albert Jacka&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and a commemorative service is held on the Sunday closest to the anniversary of his death, 17 January, in St. Kilda to honour Jacka; originally organised by former members of the 14th Battalion, it is now held by Port Phillip City Council. The regimental colour of the 14th Battalion is laid up in St Kilda Town Hall.

<doc id="943293" wikidata="Q2621297" url="?curid=943293" title="Alexander Morris (politician)">
<text>Alexander Morris (March 17, 1826 – October 28, 1889) was a Canadian politician. He served in the cabinet of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald (1869–1872), and was the second Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba (1872–1877). He also served as the founder and first Lieutenant Governor of the District of Keewatin.

==Biography==
Morris was born in Perth, Upper Canada (now Ontario), the son of William Morris, himself a prominent Canadian businessman and Conservative politician. From this privileged social position, Morris was educated in Canada and Scotland and worked for three years at the Montreal firm of Thorne and Heward. In 1847, he moved to Kingston, Ontario, and articled for a year under John A. Macdonald. In 1849, he became the first person to receive an arts degree from McGill University. He would subsequently receive other degrees from McGill, including a DCL in 1862. In 1851, he was admitted to the bar in both Canada East and Canada West; he subsequently built up a profitable legal practice.

Morris was also an author, and in 1855 published an essay entitled &quot;Canada and her resources&quot;, which called for the development of national industry. In 1858, he predicted a coming federation of the British North American colonies in a work entitled &quot;Nova Britannia&quot;, which sold 3,000 copies in its first ten days of publication. He also wrote on academic matters and developments in the Presbyterian church in Canada, of which he was a prominent member (becoming a ruling elder of its synod in the 1850s). Morris also wrote &quot;The Treaties of Canada With The Indians of Manitoba and The North-West Territories Including The Negotiations on Which They Were Based, and Other Information Relating Thereto&quot; in 1880, which is generally considered &quot;the primary source document for government&#x27;s interpretation of the treaty era in Canada.&quot;

Alexander Morris was raised for public life, and it was no surprise when he declared himself a candidate for the Province of Canada&#x27;s legislature in 1861. He ran as a Liberal-Conservative in the riding of Lanark South in Canada West, supporting the government of George-Étienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald. Morris received 1265 votes, against 828 for his opponent. The Cartier-Macdonald government came out of the 1861 election in a weakened position, and Liberal John Sandfield Macdonald was able to form a ministry in 1862. Morris, accordingly, went into the opposition. He was easily re-elected in 1863, and returned to the government side when the Étienne-Paschal Taché-John A. Macdonald ministry was formed in 1864.

Morris&#x27;s role in parliament was limited during these years, though he spoke frequently in support of confederation and played a role in negotiating the grand coalition ministry of 1864. He also expanded his business interests in this period, and was named to the board of the Commercial Bank of Canada in 1867. During his time in parliament, he was responsible for introducing a bill ending public executions in Canada. He also introduced a bill to encourage the future formation of free libraries.

Morris was re-elected by acclamation in the federal election of 1867, the first to be held following the royal proclamation of Confederation. He was appointed Minister of Inland Revenue on November 16, 1869, and served as a competent if not prominent member of the Macdonald ministry for the next three years. On the advice of his doctors, he did not seek re-election in 1872.

He was instead appointed as the first Chief Justice of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba, serving in this position from July to December 1872. He was also appointed as the acting Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories in October 1872, following the departure of Adams George Archibald. Morris maintained Archibald&#x27;s policy of conciliation among the various factions in Manitoba, and unsuccessfully attempted to establish a local police force to preserve law and order in the region. He was formally sworn in as the official Lieutenant Governor on December 2, and attempted to accelerate the settling of Métis land claims in the province.

Manitoba&#x27;s government was still in a developing state when Morris became Lieutenant Governor, and he continued Archibald&#x27;s practice of serving as the province&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; Premier. In 1873, he refused a request by Henry Joseph Clarke to be recognized as Premier of the province, and continued to exercise his own authority over the province&#x27;s legislative process.

After the defeat of the provincial ministry in July 1874, Morris asked Marc-Amable Girard to become the province&#x27;s first Premier, thereby instituting responsible government to the province. Even after this, he continued to exert considerable authority from behind the scenes.

Morris spoke for Manitoba on matters of federal–provincial relations, and helped to create the University of Manitoba in 1877. He was also actively involved in treaty negotiations with aboriginal groups, signing Treaties 3, 4, 5, and 6, and revising Treaties 1 and 2. Morris seems to have been more willing to support aboriginal land title than was his predecessor Archibald, and argued in favour of education and hunting/fishing rights for aboriginal groups. Despite some successes, however, he was unable to prevent the withdrawal of many Métis from the province (there were some suspicions about Morris&#x27;s own speculation in land previously owned by the Métis).

In 1874, with Manitoba&#x27;s finances in peril, the provincial government appealed to Ottawa for assistance. Ottawa agreed to provide aid, but demanded that the Legislative Council be eliminated in order to cut expenses. When the council twice rejected bills that would have resulted in its demise, Morris intervened by offering recalcitrant councillors lucrative government positions elsewhere. Due to Morris&#x27; mediation, Manitoba&#x27;s Legislative Council became the first provincial upper house to be abolished in 1876.

Morris stepped down as Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories in 1876, after it was made a separate jurisdiction. While losing this position, he also gained the Lieutenant Governorship of Keewatin District, a new territory which stretched up into the Arctic. He held this position until 1877, when he resigned as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and returned to Ontario.

Morris sought to return to the federal House of Commons in 1878. After losing the Conservative nomination in the Manitoba riding of Marquette, he decided to contest nearby Selkirk instead. He was defeated by Canadian Pacific Railway spokesman and Independent Conservative Donald A. Smith by 555 votes to 546, and subsequently returned to Ontario again.

Later in 1878, Ontario MLA Matthew Crooks Cameron was appointed as a judge, and the provincial seat of Toronto East became vacant. Morris contested the riding as a Conservative, and defeated his Liberal opponent J. Leys by 1891 votes to 1846. The Conservatives were in opposition to the Liberal government of Oliver Mowat in this period, and Morris served as the opposition house leader. In the general election of 1879, he personally defeated Mowat in Toronto East by 2132 votes to 2075 (though Mowat also contested Oxford North, which he won easily). Morris again defeated Leys by a narrow margin in 1883, but did not seek re-election in 1886, once more for medical reasons. The Conservatives were never able to form government in Ontario during Morris&#x27;s time in the provincial house.

Morris continued to serve as a prominent figure in the Presbyterian Church in Canada following his retirement. He died in 1889, at age 63.

<text>In abstract algebra, the term associator is used in different ways as a measure of the non-associativity of an algebraic structure. Associators are commonly studied as triple systems.

== Ring theory ==

For a non-associative ring or algebra &quot;R&quot;, the associator is the multilinear map formula_1 given by
: formula_2

Just as the commutator 
: formula_3
measures the degree of non-commutativity, the associator measures the degree of non-associativity of &quot;R&quot;.
For an associative ring or algebra the associator is identically zero.

The associator in any ring obeys the identity
: formula_4

The associator is alternating precisely when &quot;R&quot; is an alternative ring.

The associator is symmetric in its two rightmost arguments when &quot;R&quot; is a pre-Lie algebra.

The nucleus is the set of elements that associate with all others: that is, the &quot;n&quot; in &quot;R&quot; such that
: formula_5

The nucleus is an associative subring of &quot;R&quot;.

== Quasigroup theory ==

A quasigroup &quot;Q&quot; is a set with a binary operation formula_6 such that for each &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;,
the equations formula_7 and formula_8 have unique solutions &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;. In a quasigroup &quot;Q&quot;, the associator is the map formula_9 defined by the equation
: formula_10
for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;. As with its ring theory analog, the quasigroup associator is a measure of nonassociativity of &quot;Q&quot;.

== Higher-dimensional algebra ==

In higher-dimensional algebra, where there may be non-identity morphisms between algebraic expressions, an associator is an isomorphism
: formula_11

== Category theory ==

In category theory, the associator expresses the associative properties of the internal product functor in monoidal categories.

<doc id="943323" wikidata="Q360436" url="?curid=943323" title="Emilio de' Cavalieri">
<text>Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri (c. 155011 March 1602), or Emilio dei Cavalieri (the spellings &quot;del&quot; and &quot;Cavaliere&quot; are contemporary typographical errors), was an Italian composer, producer, organist, diplomat, choreographer and dancer at the end of the Renaissance era. His work, along with that of other composers active in Rome, Florence and Venice, was critical in defining the beginning of the musical Baroque era. A member of the Roman School of composers, he was an influential early composer of monody, and wrote what is usually considered to be the first oratorio.

==Life==
Cavalieri was born in Rome of an aristocratic and musical family. He was the son of Tommaso de&#x27; Cavalieri (c. 1509–1587), a close friend of Michelangelo. He probably received his early training there, and was working as an organist and music director in the period from 1578 to 1584. He spent much of his time in Rome as an organiser of Lenten oratorios. While in Rome he became associated with Cardinal Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici.

In 1587, Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici succeeded his brother as Grand Duke of Tuscany, and in 1588 he brought Cavalieri to Florence as an overseer of artists, craftsmen and musicians. Cavalieri was master of ceremonies for the extremely opulent &quot;intermedi&quot; that the Medici family required for events such as weddings. Count Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi, the founder and patron of the Florentine Camerata, also collaborated on these productions. In May 1589, the festivities for the marriage of Grand Duke Ferdinando to Christina of Lorraine included a performance of Girolamo Bargagli&#x27;s &quot;La pellegrina&quot;, with six especially elaborate &quot;intermedi.&quot; The 1st number of the final &quot;intermedio&quot; (6) was initially a piece by Bardi but was replaced in the actual &quot;intermedio&quot; by Cavalieri&#x27;s virtuosic number based on the &quot;Aria del Gran Duca&quot; which became popular all over Europe and occurs in many arrangements and variations such as that made by Peter Philips in Antwerp. Cavalieri may have gotten some of his ideas for monody directly from Bardi, since Cavalieri was not a member of the Camerata during its period of activity a few years earlier. He may have developed his rivalry with Giulio Caccini, another extremely important and influential early monodist during this period.

In the 1590s, while still in Florence, Cavalieri produced several pastorales (a semi-dramatic predecessor to opera, set in the country, with shepherds and shepherdesses as common characters). In addition to his musical activities, he was employed as a diplomat during this time, assisting in papal politics, including buying the votes of key cardinals for the elections of popes Innocent IX and Clement VIII who were expected to favour the Medici.

During the 1590s he made frequent diplomatic trips to Rome, remaining active in the musical life there, and was connected with the Congregation of the Oratory of St Philip Neri. He premiered his famous &quot;Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo...&quot; in February 1600; this piece is generally held to be the first oratorio. According to Roman records the piece was produced twice that year at the Oratorio de Filippini adjacent to Santa Maria in Vallicella, and was witnessed by thirty-five cardinals.

In 1600 Cavalieri produced &quot;Euridice&quot;, one of the first operas, by Jacopo Peri (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini); this was part of an elaborate set of festivities for the wedding of Henry IV of France and Maria de&#x27; Medici. Unfortunately for Cavalieri, he was not given control of the main event, the production of &quot;Il rapimento di Cefalo&quot;—his rival Giulio Caccini took over from him—and he left Florence in anger, never to return.

Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri died on 11 of March 1602 in Rome. He is buried in Cappella de&#x27; Cavalieri in Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri tomb disappeared during renovations in XVIII century. In March 2002 a replacement plaque commemorating his burial was placed in the chapel. The plaque states:
EMILIO DE&#x27; CAVALIERI
ROMAN GENTLEMAN,

INNOVATIVE AND TALENTED COMPOSER,

CREATOR OF THE FIRST OPERAS,

SUPERINTENDENT OF ALL THE MUSICIANS

AND ARTISTS AT THE COURT OF THE MEDICI,

CONSERVATOR OF THE ROMAN SENATE AND PEOPLE.

BURIED HERE 11 MARCH 1602

ON THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH 
==Works==
Cavalieri claimed to be the inventor of the &quot;stile rappresentativo&quot;, what is now usually known as monody, and he made the claim with considerable irritation: &quot;everyone knows I am the inventor of [this style],&quot; he said in a letter of 1600, &quot;and I said so myself in print.&quot; Caccini seems to have got more of the credit, perhaps deservedly so, because of his early association with Bardi and Vincenzo Galilei in the 1570s in Florence, where the style was first discussed and probably invented. Comparing himself to Caccini, he said of their two styles: &quot;[my] music moves people to pleasure and sadness, while theirs [i.e. Caccini&#x27;s and Peri&#x27;s] moves them to boredom and disgust.&quot;

Among Cavalieri&#x27;s secular compositions were madrigals, monodies, and pieces he wrote for &quot;intermedi&quot;; his sacred compositions included a setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and the &quot;Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo.&quot; This work, probably the most historically important composition of Cavalieri to survive, consists of alternating speech, strophic songs, recitative-like sections and madrigalian parts; subsequent oratorios often used it as a starting-point. It is the first work to be published with a figured bass. Most importantly, however, it was an attempt to demonstrate, at musically conservative Rome, that the modern monodic style was consistent with the aims of the Counter-Reformation and could be adapted to a religious as opposed to a secular purpose. The quick adoption of the modern musical style by other Roman composers attests to its effectiveness in this regard. Cavalieri was followed by other Roman School composers of the 17th century who included Domenico Mazzocchi, Giacomo Carissimi and Alessandro Scarlatti.

Most of his music is in the most advanced style of the time. His four-part vocal music usually has a highly ornamented and expressive melodic line; the differentiation of the melodic line from the others is one of the defining features of the early Baroque. Some historians believed that Cavalieri was the originator of the trill. Sometimes he experimented with the Enharmonic modulation, or enharmonic chromaticism which required equal temperament; apparently he built a special pipe organ in the 1590s for playing this kind of music.

<text>Edward Lloyd V (July 22, 1779June 2, 1834) was an American politician and slaveholder. He served as the 13th Governor of Maryland from 1809 to 1811, and as a United States Senator from Maryland between 1819 and 1826. He also served as a U.S. Congressman from the seventh district of Maryland from 1807 to 1809. Frederick Douglass described the life of the enslaved people forced to work on his plantation.

==Life and career==
Born in 1779 at &quot;Wye House&quot;, Talbot County, Maryland, he was a member of a prominent Eastern Shore family, &quot;the Lloyds of Wye,&quot; which had lived in Talbot County since the mid-17th century. His father Edward Lloyd IV was a member of the Continental Congress and his mother Elizabeth Tayloe was the daughter of John Tayloe II of Mount Airy. He received early education from private tutors.

Lloyd served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1800 to 1805. He was elected to the Ninth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Joseph H. Nicholson and was reelected to the Tenth Congress, serving from December 3, 1806, to March 3, 1809. In 1808, Lloyd was elected as Governor of Maryland, a position he served in from 1809 to 1811.

During this period Lloyd traded a Merino ram for &quot;Sailor,&quot; a male Newfoundland that had a reputation for spectacularly enthusiastic water dog retrieving of ducks. The dog was bred with other retrievers at Lloyd&#x27;s estate on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. Sailor is now considered the &quot;father&quot; of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever line.

Lloyd was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the Ninth Regiment of Maryland Militia and also served as a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1811 to 1815. He was elected as a Democratic Republican (later Crawford Republican, then Jacksonian) to the United States Senate in 1819, was reelected in 1825, and served from March 4, 1819, until his resignation on January 14, 1826. In the Senate, Lloyd served as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia (Eighteenth and Nineteenth Congresses).

Later in life, Lloyd served as member of the Maryland State Senate from 1826 to 1831, and as President of the Senate in 1826. He died in Annapolis, Maryland, and is interred in the family burying ground at Wye House near Easton, Maryland.

==Description by Frederick Douglass==

Lloyd was an important slaveholder and vocal defender of the institution of slavery throughout his political career. He owned 468 people in 1832.

The African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who had grown up as a slave on one of Lloyd&#x27;s plantations, discussed Lloyd in his 1845 autobiography &quot;The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot;. The book describes the acts of cruelty committed by Lloyd&#x27;s overseers, and dwells at length on Lloyd&#x27;s own despotic treatment, including whippings of two slaves caring for his horses:

To all these complaints no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never a word. Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave. When he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was literally the case. I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man between fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down upon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time.

<text>Amateur wrestling is a variant of wrestling practiced at Olympic, collegiate, scholastic, and other levels. There are two international wrestling styles performed at the Olympic Games, freestyle and Greco-Roman, both of which are governed by the United World Wrestling (UWW).

At the middle school and high school levels, wrestlers compete in scholastic wrestling. In collegiate wrestling, there are minor differences in some scholastic wrestling rules. 

The rapid rise in the popularity of the combat sport mixed martial arts (MMA) has increased interest in amateur wrestling due to its effectiveness within the sport and its consideration as a core discipline.

==Scoring==
Greco-Roman and freestyle differ in what holds are permitted; in Greco-Roman, the wrestlers are permitted to hold and attack only above the waist. In both Greco-Roman and freestyle, points can be scored in the following ways:
* Takedown: A wrestler gaining control over their opponent from a neutral position.
* Reversal: A wrestler gaining control over their opponent from a defensive position.
* Exposure or the Danger Position: A wrestler exposing their opponent&#x27;s back to the mat, also awarded if one&#x27;s back is to the mat but the wrestler is not pinned.
* Penalty: Various infractions (e.g. striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, using illegal holds, etc.). (Under the 2004–2005 changes to the international styles, a wrestler whose opponent takes an injury time-out receives one point unless the injured wrestler is bleeding). Any wrestler stepping out of bounds while standing in the neutral position during a match is penalized by giving their opponent a point.

===Scores only awarded in collegiate wrestling===
As in the international styles, collegiate wrestling awards points for takedowns and reversals. Penalty points are awarded in collegiate wrestling according to the current rules, which penalize moves that would impair the life or limb of the opponent. However, the manner how infractions are penalized and points awarded to the offended wrestler differ in some aspects from the international styles. Collegiate wrestling also awards points for:
* Near Fall: This is similar to the exposure (or danger position) points given in Greco-Roman and freestyle. A wrestler scores points for holding their opponent&#x27;s shoulders or scapulae to the mat for several seconds while their opponent is still not pinned.
* Time Advantage or Riding Time: On the college level, the wrestler who controlled their opponent on the mat for the most time is awarded a point; provided that the difference between the two wrestlers&#x27; time advantage is at least one minute.
* Escape: A wrestler getting from a defensive position to a neutral position. This is no longer a way to score in freestyle or Greco-Roman.

==Period format==

In the international styles, the format is now two three-minute periods. A wrestler wins the match when they were able to get more points than their opponent or 10 points lead in two rounds. For example, if one competitor gets a 10–0 lead in first the period, they will win by the superiority of points. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in period termination.

This format replaced the old format of three two-minute periods played best two out of three. One side effect of the old format was that the losing wrestler could outscore the winner. For example, periods may be scored 3–2, 0–4, 1–0, leading to a total score of 4–6 but a win for the wrestler scoring fewer points.

In collegiate wrestling, the period structure is different. A college match consists of one three-minute period, followed by two two-minute periods, with an overtime round if necessary. A high school match typically consists of three two-minute periods, with an overtime round if necessary. Under the standard rules for collegiate wrestling, draws are not possible; this rule is sometimes modified for young wrestlers.

==Victory conditions in the international styles==

A match can be won in the following ways:
* Fall: A fall, also known as a pin, occurs when one wrestler holds both of their opponent&#x27;s shoulders on the mat simultaneously.
* Technical superiority: A form of mercy rule where the match is declared over when a point differential is achieved. In American folkstyle wrestling, the point difference is 15 points, in freestyle, it is 10 points, and in Greco-Roman, it is 8 points. Folkstyle terms this a technical fall and freestyle and Greco-Roman refer to it as a technical superiority.
* Decision
* Default: If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason or fails to show up on the mat after their name is called three times before the match begins, their opponent is declared the winner of the match by default, forfeit, or withdrawal.
* Injury: If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a medical forfeit or injury default. The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. If a wrestler is injured by their opponent&#x27;s illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified.
* Disqualification: Normally, if a wrestler is assessed three Cautions for breaking the rules, they are disqualified. Under other circumstances, such as flagrant brutality, the match may be ended immediately and the wrestler disqualified and removed from the tournament.

==Victory conditions in collegiate wrestling==

While having similar victory conditions with Greco-Roman and freestyle, such as wins by fall, decision, injury, and disqualification, victory conditions in collegiate wrestling differ on some points from the international styles:
* Fall: A fall, also known as a pin, occurs when one wrestler holds any part of both of their opponent&#x27;s shoulders or both of their opponent&#x27;s shoulder blades (scapulae) in continuous contact with the mat. The fall must be held in collegiate wrestling for two seconds in high school wrestling matches and one second in college wrestling matches. A win by fall is worth six team points in a dual meet.
* Technical fall: If, at any break in the action, one wrestler leads the other by 15 points and a pinning situation is not imminent, the match ends. The winning team is then usually awarded five team points. On the college level, five team points are awarded if the winner in the course of the match received points for a near fall; four team points are awarded if the wrestler did not score near-fall points.
* Major decision: In collegiate (scholastic or folkstyle) wrestling, a decision in which the winner outscores their opponent by eight or more points is a &quot;major decision&quot; and is rewarded with four team points in a dual meet.
* Decision: After the three wrestling periods have expired and the winning wrestler possesses a difference of one to seven in points, the wrestler is given a &quot;decision&quot;, and the team is awarded three team points in a dual meet.
* Default: If a participant cannot continue wrestling for any reason during the match (e.g. illness, injury, etc.), their opponent wins by default, worth six team points in a dual meet.
* Disqualification: For flagrant misconduct or for a certain number of penalties assessed, a wrestler is disqualified from the match, and their opponent is declared the winner. In a dual meet, this victory is worth six team points. Rules for how penalties and disqualifications are determined to vary somewhat in collegiate wrestling from the international styles.
* Forfeit: If one wrestler fails to appear on the mat at the start of the match for some reason, and the other wrestler appears on the mat, the wrestler on the mat at the start of the match is automatically declared the winner. The winning team in a dual meet is then awarded six team points. If during the tournament, a wrestler wishes to no longer participate because of illness or injury, then their opponent wins by medical forfeit, worth the same number of individual and team tournament placement points as a forfeit.

Dual meet scoring is very similar on the high school level.

==Illegal moves==

Amateur wrestling is a positionally-based form of grappling, and thus generally prohibits the following:
* Biting
* Pinching or poking with the fingers, toes, or nails, including fish-hooking the nose or mouth
* Gouging or intentionally scratching the opponent – eye-gouging especially is grounds for disqualification and banned status in most amateur wrestling competitions
* Strikes using the hands, fists, elbows, feet, knees, or head
* Joint locks, including armlocks, leglocks, spinal locks, wristlocks, and small joint manipulation
* Chokeholds, strangling, suffocating, or smothering
* Spiking, or lifting and slamming the opponent head-first to the mat (though other forms of slamming are generally allowed in the international styles; in collegiate, slamming &quot;per se&quot; is illegal)
* Grasping or holding the opponent&#x27;s genitals
* Using a triangle scissors (where one knee is bent at a 90° angle and placed behind the other knee) on the head. Scissors can be used on the body or limbs, while the figure four has been made completely illegal as of 2011.
* Most types of amateur wrestling also discourage or prohibit the use of one&#x27;s own or the opponent&#x27;s clothing for grasping or performing any type of hold.
* Full nelson, when both arms are under both opponent&#x27;s forearms or arm and both hand are behind his neck or head, although, it is now legal in Junior and Senior, if it is done to the side and the head is not bent down.

==Equipment==

While there is not much equipment that a wrestler wears, it is still highly specialized. A wrestling singlet is a one-piece, tight-fitting, colored, lycra uniform. The uniform is tight-fitting so as not to get grasped accidentally by the opponent and allows the referee to see each wrestler&#x27;s body clearly when awarding points or a pin. Women wrestlers wear a higher cut singlet usually with a sports-bra underneath.

Wrestling shoes are light, flexible, thin-soled, ankle-high sneakers that allow maximum speed and traction on the mat without giving up ankle support. The current rules call for laces (if any) to be covered so that they do not come untied during competition.

In American high school and college wrestling headgear is mandatory to protect the ears from cauliflower ear and other injuries. Headgear is made from molded plastic polymer or vinyl coated energy absorbing foam over a rigid hard liner and strapped to the head tightly. In the international styles headgear is optional.

Wrestling is conducted on a padded mat that must have excellent shock absorption, tear resistance, and compression qualities. Most mats are made of PVC rubber nitrile foam. Recent advances in technology have brought about new mats made using closed cell, cross-linked polyethylene foam covered in vinyl backed with non-woven polyester.

==World participation==

The countries with the leading wrestlers in the Olympic Games and World Championships are Iran, the United States, Russia (and some of the former Soviet Union republics, especially Armenia, Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan), Bulgaria, Turkey, Hungary, Cuba, India, Canada, Japan, Pakistan, South and North Korea, Germany, and historically Sweden and Finland.

==Women==

===Summer Olympics===

Because of the successful growth in female participation, the International Olympic Committee announced that women&#x27;s freestyle wrestling would be added to the Olympic games in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece with a total of four different weight classes.

=== USA ===
Until the early 1990s, the majority of women who participated in the sport had no other choice but to join the available men&#x27;s teams. At the high school level, this may still be required in some areas depending on the number of wrestlers. Brookline High School in Brookline, Massachusetts was the first public school in America to create a varsity girls wrestling team. Girls have at times still competed against boys.

University of Minnesota-Morris was the first university to create a varsity women&#x27;s wrestling team. UMM&#x27;s head coach, Doug Reese, followed in the footsteps of other schools like Missouri Valley College that pioneered programs for female wrestlers. University of the Cumberlands, Menlo College, Pacific University, and Neosho County CC. Cal-State Bakersfield are other schools that had a number of women competitors that only competed against each other or occasionally against Canadian college teams.

As the sport continued to grow, coaches within women&#x27;s wrestling formed the Women&#x27;s Collegiate Wrestling Association (WCWA). This group created rules regarding eligibility, bylaws, and elected leaders for this association. Each year the number of intercollegiate programs continued to prosper with the WCWA now recognizing a total of 28 teams. Within these teams there are several who have National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) affiliation and most of them are allowed to compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).

There is also a national dual meet championship for women&#x27;s intercollegiate teams that have been sponsored by the National Wrestling Coaches Association for the past 6 years; the world&#x27;s top 16 teams compete in this event.

In 2004, Missouri Valley College held the first Women&#x27;s National Wrestling Championships which honored four individual champions. Later, the event would be hosted by the University of the Cumberlands in 2006.

<text>The Legacy of the Aldenata, also known as the Posleen War Series, is the fictional universe of one of John Ringo&#x27;s military science fiction series.

== Premise ==

The central premise is that in 2001, humanity receives greetings from a highly advanced, peaceable Galactic Federation. However, all is not well, for a species of aggressive aliens known as the Posleen are attacking the Galactics. Since the Galactics are almost entirely unable to fight, they are appealing to the proven military abilities of humanity for aid.

However, things are rarely as simple as they seem, and humanity soon discovers that the Galactics are no friends at all. There are plots within plots, some going back to the dawn of humanity and beyond: plots that endanger the very survival of humanity.

The first four novels cover the Posleen War in which the Posleen invade Earth. Another novel, &quot;Cally&#x27;s War&quot; (and its two sequels), takes up the story a few decades later; &quot;The Hero&quot; is set nearly a thousand years later. &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; takes place immediately after Gust Front and extends until March 2008, with the very last chapter taking place at some unspecified point far after the end of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Faire&quot; but prior to the beginning of &quot;The Hero&quot;.

A role-playing game based on the d20 system and the &quot;Legacy of the Aldenata&quot; was included on the free CD-ROM included in the first hardcover edition of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Faire&quot;.

The fourth novel &quot;Hell&#x27;s Faire&quot; includes some &quot;Sluggy Freelance&quot; guest strips by Pete Abrams since the popular internet comic strip is featured somewhat prominently in a way. (A massive armored military vehicle is named after Bun-Bun the mini-lop from the strip.) Some of the strips are samples of the actual comic strip and others are an exclusive alternate timeline setting where the Sluggy characters have to deal with the Posleen invasion.

As the Posleen have yellow blood, the war song &quot;March of Cambreadth&quot; (&quot;Let their yellow blood run cold&quot;) becomes popular with the military. The song, its lyrics, and artist&#x27;s bio is included in the Baen Free Library.

==Books==

=== Main series storyline ===
;Posleen War
*&quot;A Hymn Before Battle&quot; (2000) ()

With the Earth in the path of the rapacious Posleen, the peaceful and friendly races of the Galactic Federation offer their resources to help the backward Terrans—for a price.

*&quot;Gust Front&quot; (2001) ()

Our choice was simple: we could be cannon fodder, or we could be ... fodder. We could send our forces to fight and die (as only humans can) against a ravening horde that was literally feeding on its interstellar conquests, or remain as we were: virtually weaponless and third in line for brunch.

We chose to fight.

*&quot;When the Devil Dances&quot; (2002) () 

After five years of battling invaders, human civilization prepares a strike to drive the aliens from the Earth. But the Clan-Lord of the Sten has learned from the defeats human have dealt him, and has his own battle plan. When he squares off against Major Michael O&#x27;Neal, the only winner will be Satan himself...

*&quot;Hell&#x27;s Faire&quot; (2003) ()

With the defenses of the Southern Appalachians sundered, the only thing standing between the ravening Posleen hordes and the soft interior of the Cumberland Plateau are the veterans of the 555th Mobile Infantry.

=== Future books ===
According to John Ringo&#x27;s website, two more books in the series are planned, titled &quot;Beneath the Avalanche&quot; (2015) and &quot;Master of the Winds&quot; (2020). The latest information regarding last two books in series as at September 2017 is that Ringo is working on other projects and has no current plans to finish these two books.

=== Fanon ===
Two electronic books have been created by a fan and are considered canon by Baen Barflies, but the canonical status of such works is uncertain. The titles are &quot;The Yeomen of England&quot; and &quot;Holy War&quot; set in England and Saudi Arabia respectively written by Christopher Nuttall, currently available for free download at his website.

==Military forces==
The series premises total mobilization of the human population of Earth. The human forces in the service of the Galactic Federation are divided into the Fleet (the space navy), and Fleet Strike (the ground forces component, combining marines, special forces, and previously airborne units). In the books written thus far, Fleet Strike has had the lion&#x27;s share of attention.

The technology made available includes rejuvenation and life extension. The desperate straits of the setting lead to the revival of the Waffen-SS in &quot;The Watch on the Rhine&quot;. With the rejuvenations in full swing in Germany, many ex-SS officers have become young again. In the novel, the majority of the ex-SS were just soldiers; only a few are hardcore Nazis. This causes a lot of dissent in the German Parliament and citizenry. The &quot;Greens&quot; and the &quot;Reds&quot; (nicknames for the German political parties Alliance 90/The Greens and the Social Democratic Party of Germany) organize riots and protests; the re-integration of the SS officers and the choice of the Parliament and Chancellor to give to those officers control of the training of the young men of Germany.

<doc id="943368" wikidata="Q142268" url="?curid=943368" title="Namibia at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Namibia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.

Namibian National Olympic Committee sent a total of eight athletes to the Games, seven men and one woman, to compete in 5 sports. Three of them had previously competed in Sydney, including pistol shooter Friedhelm Sack and mountain biker Mannie Heymans. Sprinter and four-time Olympic silver medalist Frankie Fredericks sought his official comeback to the Games after an eight-year absence with the hopes of adding another medal to his career hardware. Flyweight boxer Paulus Ambunda was appointed by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Namibia, however, failed to win a single Olympic medal for the second consecutive time since the previous Games. Being a top favorite for the Namibian team, Fredericks fell short of claiming his third medal in the 200 metres, and thereby missed a chance to climb into the podium on his final Olympic appearance. On August 29, 2004, at the time of the closing ceremony, Fredericks was elected to the IOC Athletes&#x27; Commission, along with three other athletes.

==Athletics==

Namibian athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

<text>The Lagoon Nebula (catalogued as Messier 8 or M8, NGC 6523, Sharpless 25, RCW 146, and Gum 72) is a giant interstellar cloud in the constellation Sagittarius. It is classified as an emission nebula and has an H II region.

The Lagoon Nebula was discovered by Giovanni Hodierna before 1654 and is one of only two star-forming nebulae faintly visible to the eye from mid-northern latitudes. Seen with binoculars, it appears as a distinct cloud-like patch with a definite core. Within the nebula is the open cluster NGC 6530.

== Characteristics ==
The Lagoon Nebula is estimated to be between 4,000–6,000 light-years away from the Earth. In the sky of Earth, it spans 90&#x27; by 40&#x27;, which translates to an actual dimension of 110 by 50 light years. Like many nebulae, it appears pink in time-exposure color photos but is gray to the eye peering through binoculars or a telescope, human vision having poor color sensitivity at low light levels. The nebula contains a number of Bok globules (dark, collapsing clouds of protostellar material), the most prominent of which have been catalogued by E. E. Barnard as B88, B89 and B296. It also includes a funnel-like or tornado-like structure caused by a hot O-type star that emanates ultraviolet light, heating and ionizing gases on the surface of the nebula. The Lagoon Nebula also contains at its centre a structure known as the Hourglass Nebula (so named by John Herschel), which should not be confused with the better known Engraved Hourglass Nebula in the constellation of Musca. In 2006, four Herbig–Haro objects were detected within the Hourglass, providing direct evidence of active star formation by accretion within it.

<doc id="943375" wikidata="Q1191424" url="?curid=943375" title="Department of Defense Dependents Schools">
<text>The Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) are a network of schools, both primary and secondary, that serve the dependents of United States military and civilian United States Department of Defense (DoD) personnel in three areas of the world; Europe, Pacific, and Eastern United States and Caribbean areas. United States Contractor personnel supporting the Department of Defense overseas are eligible to send their dependents for a fee. The schools themselves are operated by the [[Department of Defense Education Activity]] (DoDEA). This school system is the tenth-largest American school system.

== History ==
DoDDS started operating schools October 14, 1946, for the children of military overseas. The intent was to ensure an American educational experience for the American student. Therefore the children, teachers, and educational program were and are American. It then cost $10 to enroll a child ($ in 2024 dollars). The schools would get operational funds from profits made by Class VI stores (alcohol). It now can cost as much as $20,000 for enrollment for non-Command Sponsored military families, or Command Sponsored Contractors, and increases approximately $800 annually.

In 1946, the Department of Defense Dependent Schools was created for dependents of military members of the armed forces in overseas areas. After World War II, the increased demand for American education overseas was a result of the government&#x27;s decision to allow soldiers to bring their families when deployed. By 1949, almost 100 schools were being operated separately by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in countries around the world.

In 2011 there were 120 schools. With the closing of Heidelberg High School in 2012, all of the original high schools opened in post World War II Europe are now closed, although many other DoDDS high schools have opened since then. The original six were Berlin, Bremen, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Munich and Nurnberg. All six American High Schools opened in Germany in September/October 1946. DoDDS also operates Kubasaki High School on Okinawa, Japan, Nile C. Kinnick High School in Yokosuka, Japan (formerly Yokohama High School), and W.T. Sampson High School in Cuba.

Although operating outside the U.S., the DoDDS system is the tenth largest of American school systems.

== Operations ==
All schools in the DoDDS system operate outside of the states of the United States and the District of Columbia. There are also some schools that operate on military installations within the United States, but those are grouped in a separate organization within DoDEA, the Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS). DoDDS has superintendents for two districts: Europe and Pacific. The DoDDS Pacific schools are, for the most part, in the Far East on installations in South Korea and Japan. Schools on military bases in Guam are under DDESS jurisdiction, but are administered by DoDDS Pacific (presumably for administrative convenience). Turkish DoDDS schools are served by the European branch. Schools on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba fall under the jurisdiction of DoDDS, but are administered by DDESS. Schools on bases in Puerto Rico are under DDESS.

Although the schools are primarily for dependents of military personnel, U.S. government employees are allowed to enroll their children in the schools on a space-available basis. As all of these schools are situated overseas, a concerted effort is made to immerse the children in the local culture. Language and culture courses are offered as early as elementary school, while advanced language courses and opportunities to intimately view the culture of the student&#x27;s host nation are offered throughout high school.

DoDDS schools operate with two structures in terms of grade levels:
*The old American standard, in which elementary schools run from kindergarten to sixth grade while high school serves seventh through twelfth graders.
*A newer standard, adopted by some DoDDS facilities in the 1970s, in which kindergarten to 3rd-5th grade students attend elementary school, post-elementary students up to 8th grade attend middle school, and 9th through 12th graders attend high school.

As a result of IDEA 2004, students with special education disabilities attend schools within DoDDS. These students are in pre-K (preschool or early childhood) through high school. The infants-toddlers special education program exists overseas on U.S. military bases, though not coordinated through DoDDS. School psychologists are directly employed by DoDDS and civilian employed clinical child psychologists are employed by the U.S. military to provide direct and indirect services to students with special needs. Not all levels of special education services are available at all schools and base locations.

DoDDS range from kindergarten to 12th grade, and some universities are accredited by the Department of Defense.

In addition to operating retail facilities on overseas military installations, the Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service provides four million school lunches each year in overseas Department of Defense schools at a break-even expense to support military families.

==Environmental changes==

While there are typical environmental changes that may affect any child&#x27;s educational performance such as divorce, and relocation, there are some that are systemic with military children. Relocation is frequent and parents may be deployed from home.

A study was done focusing on parental absences during the time of the military deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2002 and 2005. The study reports the adverse effects of deployment especially with long deployments or deployments that occur during the month of academic testing. Effects can continue and can be detrimental for children&#x27;s academic achievements.

== Districts ==
For the European branch of DoDDS, there are three districts:
*Europe East – headquartered at Kaiserslautern – 35 schools across Germany
*Europe West – headquartered at Brussels – 20 schools in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands
*Europe South – headquartered at Vicenza – 21 schools in Bahrain, Italy, Spain, and Turkey

The Pacific branch, officially DoDDS-Pacific/DDESS-Guam, has three DoDDS districts and one DDESS district:
*Pacific West District – headquartered in Seoul – 10 schools
*Pacific East District – headquartered at Yokota Air Base in Japan – 21 schools
*Pacific South District – headquartered at Kadena Air Base in Japan – 17 schools

=== Schools ===
== Miscellaneous ==
The Kaiserslautern District has the most DoDDS schools worldwide, and serves over 5,000 students.
Beginning with the 2007–08 school year, Kaiserslautern High School merged with a neighboring elementary school. Students from Landstuhl Middle School and other students living in select areas were redistricted to Kaiserslautern starting with the 2008–09 school year. Current elementary students will attend Vogelweh Elementary. Therefore, KHS&#x27;s student population will increase from 650 students to about 900.
For every sports season, the schools compete in the DoDDS Championship, held at various locations.

<doc id="943379" wikidata="Q142183" url="?curid=943379" title="Nigeria at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Nigeria competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s thirteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, because of the African boycott. Nigerian Olympic Committee sent a total of 72 athletes, 24 men and 48 women, to the Games to compete in 10 sports. For the first time in its Olympic history, Nigeria was represented by more female than male athletes. Women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s football were the only team-based sports in which Nigeria had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in men&#x27;s freestyle wrestling.

Fifteen athletes from the Nigerian team had previously competed in Sydney, including five football players from the women&#x27;s squad and Olympic silver medalist Enefiok Udo-Obong in the men&#x27;s 4 × 400 m relay. At age 36, sprinter Mary Onyali-Omagbemi became the first Nigerian athlete to compete in fifth Olympic Games, while table tennis players Segun Toriola and Bose Kaffo followed Onyali&#x27;s footsteps to fulfill their fourth Olympic bid in Athens. For being the oldest and most experienced athlete of the team, Onyali reprised her role to carry the Nigerian flag in the opening ceremony for the second time since 1996.

Nigeria left Athens with only two Olympic bronze medals, all from the men&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay (led by Deji Aliu) and 4 × 400 m relay teams (led by Udo-Obong).

<text>A Tsirelson bound is an upper limit to quantum mechanical correlations between distant events. Given that quantum mechanics violates Bell inequalities (i.e., it cannot be described by a local hidden-variable theory), a natural question to ask is how large can the violation be. The answer is precisely the Tsirelson bound for the particular Bell inequality in question. In general, this bound is lower than the bound that would be obtained if more general theories, only constrained by &quot;no-signalling&quot; (i.e., that they do not permit communication faster than light), were considered, and much research has been dedicated to the question of why this is the case.

The Tsirelson bounds are named after Boris S. Tsirelson (or Cirel&#x27;son, in a different transliteration), the author of the article in which the first one was derived.

==Bound for the CHSH inequality==

The first Tsirelson bound was derived as an upper bound on the correlations measured in the CHSH inequality. It states that if we have four (Hermitian) dichotomic observables formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, formula_4 (i.e., two observables for Alice and two for Bob) with outcomes formula_5 such that formula_6 for all formula_7, then

: formula_8

For comparison, in the classical case (or local realistic case) the upper bound is 2, whereas if any arbitrary assignment of formula_5 is allowed, it is 4. The Tsirelson bound is attained already if Alice and Bob each makes measurements on a qubit, the simplest non-trivial quantum system.

Several proofs of this bound exist, but perhaps the most enlightening one is based on the Khalfin–Tsirelson–Landau identity. If we define an observable

: formula_10

and formula_11, i.e., if the observables&#x27; outcomes are formula_5, then

: formula_13

If formula_14 or formula_15, which can be regarded as the classical case, it already follows that formula_16. In the quantum case, we need only notice that formula_17, and the Tsirelson bound formula_18 follows.

==Other Bell inequalities ==

Tsirelson also showed that for any bipartite full-correlation Bell inequality with &quot;m&quot; inputs for Alice and &quot;n&quot; inputs for Bob, the ratio between the Tsirelson bound and the local bound is at most
formula_19
where
formula_20
and formula_21 is the Grothendieck constant of order &quot;d&quot;. Note that since formula_22, this bound implies the above result about the CHSH inequality.

In general, obtaining a Tsirelson bound for a given Bell inequality is a hard problem that has to be solved on a case-by-case basis. It is not even known to be decidable. The best known computational method for upperbounding it is a convergent hierarchy of semidefinite programs, the NPA hierarchy, that in general does not halt. The exact values are known for a few more Bell inequalities:

For the Braunstein–Caves inequalities we have that

: formula_23

For the WWŻB inequalities the Tsirelson bound is

: formula_24

For the formula_25 inequality the Tsirelson bound is not known exactly, but concrete realisations give a lower bound of , and the NPA hierarchy gives an upper bound of . It is conjectured that only infinite-dimensional quantum states can reach the Tsirelson bound.

==Derivation from physical principles ==

Significant research has been dedicated to finding a physical principle that explains why quantum correlations go only up to the Tsirelson bound and nothing more. Three such principles have been found: no-advantage for non-local computation, information causality and macroscopic locality. That is to say, if one could achieve a CHSH correlation exceeding Tsirelson&#x27;s bound, all such principles would be violated.
Tsirelson&#x27;s bound also follows if the Bell experiment admits a strongly positive quantal measure.

==Tsirelson&#x27;s problem==

There are two different ways of defining the Tsirelson bound of a Bell expression. One by demanding that the measurements are in a tensor product structure, and another by demanding only that they commute. Tsirelson&#x27;s problem is the question of whether these two definitions are equivalent. More formally, let
: formula_26
be a Bell expression, where formula_27 is the probability of obtaining outcomes formula_28 with the settings formula_29. The tensor product Tsirelson bound is then the supremum of the value attained in this Bell expression by making measurements formula_30 and formula_31 on a quantum state formula_32:
: formula_33
The commuting Tsirelson bound is the supremum of the value attained in this Bell expression by making measurements formula_34 and formula_35 such that formula_36 on a quantum state formula_37:
: formula_38
Since tensor product algebras in particular commute, formula_39. In finite dimensions commuting algebras are always isomorphic to (direct sums of) tensor product algebras, so only for infinite dimensions it is possible that formula_40. Tsirelson&#x27;s problem is the question of whether for all Bell expressions formula_41.

This question was first considered by Boris Tsirelson in 1993, where he asserted without proof that formula_41. Upon being asked for a proof by Antonio Acín in 2006, he realized that the one he had in mind didn&#x27;t work, and issued the question as an open problem. Together with Miguel Navascués and Stefano Pironio, Antonio Acín had developed an hierarchy of semidefinite programs, the NPA hierarchy, that converged to the commuting Tsirelson bound formula_43 from above, and wanted to know whether it also converged to the tensor product Tsirelson bound formula_44, the most physically relevant one.

Since one can produce a converging sequencing of approximations to formula_44 from below by considering finite-dimensional states and observables, if formula_41, then this procedure can be combined with the NPA hierarchy to produce a halting algorithm to compute the Tsirelson bound, making it a computable number (note that in isolation neither procedure halts in general). Conversely, if formula_44 is not computable, then formula_40. In January 2020, Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen claimed to have proven that formula_44 is not computable, thus solving Tsirelson&#x27;s problem in the negative; Tsirelson&#x27;s problem has been shown to be equivalent to Connes&#x27; embedding problem, so the same proof also implies that the Connes embedding problem is false.
