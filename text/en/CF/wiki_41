<text>Carlo Levi () (29 November 1902 – 4 January 1975) was an Italian painter, writer, activist, independent leftist politician, and doctor.

He is best known for his book &quot;Cristo si è fermato a Eboli&quot; (&quot;Christ Stopped at Eboli&quot;), published in 1945, a memoir of his time spent in exile in Lucania, Italy, after being arrested in connection with his political activism. In 1979, the book became the basis of a movie of the same name, directed by Francesco Rosi. Lucania, also called Basilicata, was historically one of the poorest regions of the impoverished Italian south. Levi&#x27;s lucid, non-ideological and sympathetic description of the daily hardships experienced by the local peasants helped to propel the &quot;Problem of the South&quot; into national discourse after the end of World War II.

==Early life==

Levi was born in Turin, Piedmont, to wealthy Jewish physician Ercole Levi and Annetta Treves, the sister of Claudio Treves, a socialist leader in Italy. He graduated from high school (&quot;Liceo Alfieri&quot;) in 1917, and then attended the University of Turin, where he studied medicine and graduated in 1924 with high marks. While at university, Levi had become friends with Piero Gobetti who sparked his interest in political activism that would continue throughout his life. Soon after graduation from the University of Turin, Levi exhibited some of his works at the XIV Venice Biennale.

Levi never completely abandoned his medical studies and served as assistant to Professor Micheli at the University of Turin&#x27;s Clinic from 1924 to 1928, working on research involving hepatopathy and diseases of bile tract. During the same period, Levi continued his specialization studies in Paris with Professor Bourguignon among others, although by 1927 he had decided to dedicate his life to painting. Levi&#x27;s early time in Paris, as a painter and as a student of medicine, brought him into contact with many notable personalities of the 20th century, including Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, Alberto Moravia, Giorgio de Chirico, and others. He lived almost exclusively in Paris from 1932 to 1934 and, while there, attended the funeral in 1933 of his uncle (his mother&#x27;s brother), Claudio Treves.

==Political activism and exile==
In 1929, along with Carlo and Nello Rosselli he founded an anti-fascist movement called Giustizia e Libertà, becoming a leader of the Italian branch along with Leone Ginzburg, a Russian Jew from Odessa who had emigrated with his parents to Italy. He also joined with Francesco Menzio in the &quot;Gruppo dei Sei&quot; (&quot;Group of six&quot;), all painters in Turin, including Jessie Boswell, Gigi Chessa, Nicola Galante and Enrico Paulucci.

As a result of his activism and involvement with anti-fascist movements, Levi was arrested and exiled to Aliano (Gagliano in &quot;Cristo si è fermato a Eboli&quot;) and Grassano, two towns in a remote area of Italy called Lucania (now Basilicata) from 1935 to 1936. There he encountered a poverty almost unknown in prosperous northern Italy. While there, Levi worked on the side as one of the doctors for the villagers, although he had never practised medicine after graduating from medical school. During his exile he spent much of his time painting.

After his release, he moved to France and lived there from 1939 to 1941. In 1941, he returned to Italy, and was later arrested again in Florence and imprisoned in the Murate prison. He was released following Benito Mussolini&#x27;s arrest and sought refuge across the street from the Pitti Palace, where he wrote &quot;Cristo si è fermato a Eboli&quot;. The square there has been named after him.
After World War II, he moved to Rome and from 1945 to 1946 he served as the editor of &quot;L&#x27;Italia Libera&quot;, the publication of the Partito d&#x27;Azione, an anti-fascist organization that grew out of the republican tradition. He continued to write and paint, exhibiting in Europe and the United States. His written works include &quot;L&#x27;Orologio&quot; (&quot;The Watch&quot;) (1950), &quot;Le parole sono pietre&quot; (&quot;Words Are Stones&quot;) (1955), and &quot;Il Futuro ha un Cuore Antico&quot; (&quot;The Future has an Ancient Heart&quot;) (1956). In 1963, he was elected to the Senate as an independent on the Communist Party ticket; he was re-elected to the Senate in 1968 and served there until 1972. He died of pneumonia in Rome on 4 January 1975. He is buried in Aliano. The &#x27;Persiana&#x27; Gallery in Palermo exhibited his last work, &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot;, executed on a goatskin drum the day before he was admitted to hospital.

<text>The Monza Circuit (Italian: ; ) is a race track near the city of Monza, north of Milan, in Italy. Built in 1922, it was the world&#x27;s third purpose-built motor racing circuit after Brooklands and Indianapolis and the oldest in mainland Europe. The circuit&#x27;s biggest event is the Italian Grand Prix. With the exception of the 1980 running when the track was closed while undergoing refurbishment, the race has been hosted there since 1949. The circuit is also known as &quot;The Temple of Speed&quot; due to its long straights and high-speed corners.

Built in the Royal Villa of Monza park in a woodland setting, the site has three tracks – the Grand Prix track, the Junior track, and a high speed oval track with steep bankings, which was left unused for decades and had been decaying until it was restored in the 2010s. The major features of the main Grand Prix track include the &quot;Curva Grande&quot;, the &quot;Curva di Lesmo&quot;, the &quot;Variante Ascari&quot; and the &quot;Curva Alboreto&quot; (formerly &quot;Curva Parabolica&quot;). The high speed curve, Curva Grande, is located after the &quot;Variante del Rettifilo&quot; which is located at the end of the front straight or &quot;Rettifilo Tribune&quot;, and is usually taken flat out by Formula One cars.

In addition to Formula One, the circuit previously hosted the 1,000 km Monza, an endurance sports car race held as part of the World Sportscar Championship and the Le Mans Series. Monza also featured the unique Race of Two Worlds events, which attempted to run Formula One and USAC National Championship cars against each other. The racetrack also previously held rounds of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing (Italian motorcycle Grand Prix), WTCC, TCR International Series, Superbike World Championship, Formula Renault 3.5 Series and Auto GP. Monza currently hosts rounds of the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup, International GT Open and Euroformula Open Championship, as well as various local championships such as the TCR Italian Series, Italian GT Championship, Porsche Carrera Cup Italia and Italian F4 Championship, as well as the Monza Rally Show. In 2020, Monza hosted the 2020 World Rally Championship final round, ACI Rally Monza, with the circuit hosting 10 of the 16 rally stages.

Monza also hosts cycling and running events, most notably the Monza 12h Cycling Marathon and Monza 21 Half Marathon. The venue was also selected by Nike scientists for the Breaking2 event, where three runners attempted to break the 2-hour barrier for the marathon. Eliud Kipchoge ran 2:00:25.

A very fast circuit, Monza has been the site of many fatal accidents, especially in the early years of the Formula One world championship, and has claimed the lives of 52 drivers and 35 spectators. Track modifications have continuously occurred, to improve spectator safety and reduce curve speeds, but it is still criticised by the current drivers for its lack of run-off areas, most notoriously at the chicane that cuts the &quot;Variante della Roggia&quot;.

==History==

=== Early history ===


The first track was built from May to July 1922 by 3,500 workers, financed by the Milan Automobile Club – which created the &quot;Società Incremento Automobilismo e Sport&quot; (SIAS) (English: &quot;Motoring and Sport Encouragement Company&quot;) to run the track. The initial form was a site with of macadamised road – comprising a loop track, and a road track. The track was officially opened on 3 September 1922, with the maiden race the second Italian Grand Prix held on 10 September 1922. Monza’s close proximity to Milan, the center of Italy’s economy, the largest metropolitian area in Italy and one of Europe’s leading major cities made Monza a particularly convenient location for racing and other events.

In 1928, the most serious Italian racing accident to date ended in the death of driver Emilio Materassi and 27 spectators at that year&#x27;s Italian Grand Prix. The accident led to further Grand Prix races&#x27; confinement to the high-speed loop until 1932. For these reasons the Italian Grand Prix was not held again until 1931; in the meantime the 1930 Monza Grand Prix was held on the high speed ring only, while in 1930 Vincenzo Florio introduced the Florio Circuit. The 1933 Italian Grand Prix was held on the original complete layout but it was marred by the deaths of three drivers (Giuseppe Campari, Baconin Borzacchini and Stanisław Czaykowski) in the supporting Monza Grand Prix held on the same day - which became known as the &quot;Black Day of Monza&quot; - over the shorter oval circuit and the Grand Prix layout was changed: in 1934 a short circuit with two lanes of the straight line joined by a hairpin, &quot;Curva Sud&quot; of the banking (with a double chicane) driven in the opposite direction than usual, the &quot;Florio link&quot; and the &quot;Curva Sud&quot; (with a small chicane). This configuration was considered too slow and in 1935 Florio Circuit was used again, this time with four temporary chicanes and another one permanent (along the &quot;Curva Sud&quot; of the banking). In 1938 only the last one was used.

There was major rebuilding in 1938–39, constructing new stands and entrances, resurfacing the track, removing the high speed ring and adding two new bends on the southern part of the circuit. The resulting layout gave a Grand Prix lap of , in use until 1954. The outbreak of World War II meant racing at the track was suspended until 1948 and parts of the circuit degraded due to the lack of maintenance and military use. Monza was renovated over a period of two months at the beginning of 1948 and a Grand Prix was held on 17 October 1948.

===High speed oval===
In 1954, work began to entirely revamp the circuit, resulting in a course, and a new high-speed oval with banked &quot;sopraelevata&quot; curves (the southern one was moved slightly north). The two circuits could be combined to re-create the former long circuit, with cars running parallel on the main straight. The first Lesmo curve was modified to be made faster, and the track infrastructure and facilities were also updated and improved to better accommodate the teams and spectators.

The Automobile Club of Italy held Race of Two Worlds exhibition competitions, intended to pit United States Auto Club IndyCars against European Formula One and sports cars. The races were held on the oval at the end of June in 1957 and 1958, with three 63 lap heat races each year, races which colloquially became known as the &quot;Monzanapolis&quot; series. Concerns were raised among the European drivers that flat-out racing on the banking would be too dangerous, so ultimately only Ecurie Ecosse and Maserati represented European racing at the first running. The American teams had brought special Firestone tyres with them, reinforced to withstand high-speed running on the bumpy Monza surface, but the Maseratis&#x27; steering was badly affected by the larger-than-usual tyre size, leading to the Modena-based team withdrawal.

Ecurie Ecosse&#x27;s three Jaguar D-type sports cars used their Le Mans-specification tyres with no ill-effects, but since they raced at less than their practice speeds to conserve their tyres, they were completely outpaced. Two heats in 1957 were won by Jimmy Bryan in his Kuzma-Offenhauser &quot;Dean Van Lines Special&quot;, and the last by Troy Ruttman in the Watson-Offenhauser &quot;John Zink Special&quot;. In 1958 Jaguar, Ferrari and Maserati teams appeared alongside the Indy roadsters, but once again the American cars dominated the event and Jim Rathmann won the three races in a Watson-Offenhauser car.

Formula One used the high speed track in the 1955, 1956, 1960 and 1961 Grands Prix. Stirling Moss and Phil Hill both won twice in this period, with Hill&#x27;s win at Monza making him the first American to win a Formula One race. The combined circuit was not used for 3 years because during the 1956 event the Ferraris and Maseratis were suffering mechanically on the banking, and the combined circuit was used again in 1960 because Ferrari&#x27;s main strength that year was straight-line speed and the organizers wanted to maximise this advantage. The 1961 race saw the death of Wolfgang von Trips and fifteen spectators when a collision with Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus sent von Trips&#x27; car airborne and into the barriers at the approach to the Parabolica.

Although the accident did not occur on the oval section of the track, the high speeds were deemed unsafe and F1 use of the oval was ended. Another attempt was made to use the combined circuit for the 1963 race, but the extremely bumpy nature and poor overall quality of the concrete banking saw some cars suffer mechanically. The teams protested and threatened to leave unless only the road circuit was used, which is ultimately what happened. Future Grands Prix were held on the shorter road circuit, with the banking appearing one last time in the film &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. New safety walls, rails and fences were added before the next race and the refuelling area was moved further from the track. Chicanes were added before both bankings in 1966, and another fatality in the 1968 1000 km Monza race led to run-off areas added to the curves, with the track layout changing the next year to incorporate permanent chicanes before the banked curves – extending the track length by .

The combined circuit held its last major race in 1969 with the 1000 km of Monza, the event moving solely to the road circuit the next year; the banking has never been used again for any major races. The banking still exists, albeit in a decayed state in the years since the last race, escaping demolition in the 1990s. It is used once a year for the Monza Rally, which served part of the 2021 World Rally Championship, which was the first FIA championship event since 1969. The banked oval was used several times for record breaking until the late 1960s, although the severe bumping was a major suspension and tyre test for the production cars attempting endurance records, such as the Ford Corsair GT which in 1964 captured 13 records.

===Circuit changes and modernisation===
Both car and Grand Prix motorcycle racing were regular attractions at Monza. These races involved drivers constantly slipstreaming competing cars, which produced several close finishes, such as in 1967, 1969, and 1971.

As the speed of the machines increased, two chicanes were added in 1972 to reduce racing speeds – the Variante del Rettifilo at the middle of the start/finish straight, and the Variante &quot;Ascari&quot;. This resulted in a new circuit length of . Grand Prix motorcycles continued to use the un-slowed road track until two serious accidents resulted in five deaths, including Renzo Pasolini and Jarno Saarinen, in 1973, and motorcycle racing did not return to Monza until 1981. The 1972 chicanes were soon seen to be ineffective at slowing cars; the &quot;Vialone&quot; was remade in 1974, the other, &quot;Curva Grande&quot; in 1976, and a third also added in 1976 before the &quot;Lesmo&quot;, with extended run-off areas. The Grand Prix lap after these alterations was increased to long.

With technology still increasing vehicle speeds the track was modified again in 1979 with added safety measures such as new kerbs, extended run-off areas and tyre-barriers to improve safety for drivers off the track. The infrastructure was also improved, with pits able to accommodate 46 cars, and an upgraded paddock and scrutineering facilities. These changes encouraged world championship motorcycling to return in 1981, but further safety work was undertaken through the 1980s. Also in the 1980s the podium, paddock and pits complex, stands, and camp site were either rebuilt or improved.

As motorsport became more safety conscious following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger in at the Imola circuit, the three main long curves were &quot;squeezed&quot; in order to install larger gravel traps, shortening the lap to . In the stands were reworked to expand capacity to 51,000. In , the chicane on the main straight was altered, changing from a double left-right chicane to a single right-left chicane in an attempt to reduce the frequent accidents at the starts due to the conformation of the braking area, although it is still deemed unsafe in terms of motorcycle racing. The second chicane was also re-profiled. In the Formula 1 Grand Prix of the same year, the first to use these new chicanes, a fire marshal, Paolo Gislimberti, was killed by flying debris after a big pileup at the second chicane.

In 2007, the run-off area at the second chicane was changed from gravel to asphalt. The length of the track in its current configuration is . At the 2010 Monza Superbike World Championship round, Italian rider Max Biaggi set the fastest ever motorcycle lap of Monza when he rode his Aprilia RSV4 1000 F to pole position in a time of 1:42.121. In the Superpole qualification for the 2011 race, he improved on this lap time, for a new lap record of 1:41.745 and his speed was captured at more than .

In late 2016, work was planned on a new first bend, which would have bypassed the first chicane and the Curva Grande. Drivers were to go through a fast right hand kink and into a new, faster chicane. Work was planned for to be completed by 2017 in hopes of a renewed contract for Formula 1. Gravel would have also returned to the run-off area at the Parabolica bend. However, plans for the track&#x27;s change were suspended due to the track being in the historic Monza Park. Ahead of the 2024 Italian Grand Prix, the Monza Circuit underwent significant changes. This forced WEC to abandon the 6 Hours of Monza, moving it to the Imola Circuit. In addition to facility improvements, changes included a resurfacing of the entire track.

==A lap of the circuit in a Formula One car==

Monza, throughout its long and storied history has been known for its high-speed, simplistic nature (compared to &quot;harder&quot; circuits such as Singapore or Monaco, which are tight, unforgiving street circuits with lots of corners) thanks to its 1920s design and the few alterations it has received, and is currently the fastest track on the Formula One calendar and has been so since 1991. Monza consists of very long straights and tight chicanes, putting a premium on good braking stability and traction. The circuit is very hard on engines; Formula 1 engines are at full throttle for nearly 80% of the lap, with engine failures common, notably Fernando Alonso in the 2006 Italian Grand Prix or Nico Rosberg in the 2015 Italian Grand Prix.

Drivers are on full throttle for most of the lap due to its long straights and fast corners, and is usually the scenario in which the open-wheeled Formula One cars show the raw speed of which they are capable: during the mid-2000s V10 engine formula, although in 2012 with the 2.4L V8 engines, top speeds in Formula One rarely reached over ; the 1.6L turbocharged hybrid V6 engine, reduced-downforce formula of 2014 displayed top speeds of up to . The circuit is generally flat, but has a gradual gradient from the second Lesmos to the Variante Ascari. Due to the low aerodynamic profile needed, with its resulting low downforce, the grip is very low; understeer is a more serious issue than at other circuits; however, the opposite effect, oversteer, is also present in the second sector, requiring the use of a very distinctive opposite lock technique. Since both maximum power and minimal drag are keys for speed on the straights, only competitors with enough power or aerodynamic efficiency at their disposal are able to challenge for the top places.

Formula One cars are set up with one of the smallest wing angles on the F1 calendar to ensure the lowest level of drag on the straights. There are only 6 corner complexes at Monza: the first two chicanes, the two &quot;Lesmos&quot;, the &quot;Ascari&quot; complex and the &quot;Parabolica&quot;. Thus cars are set up for maximum performance on the straights.

Cars approach the first corner at in eighth gear, and brake at about before the first chicane—the &quot;Variante del Rettifilo&quot;—entering at in second gear, and exiting at in second gear. This is the scene of many first-lap accidents. Higher kerbs were installed at the first two chicanes in 2009 to prevent cutting.

Good traction out of the first corner is imperative for a quick lap. Conservation of speed through the first chicane is made possible by driving the straightest line, as a small mistake here can result in a lot of time being lost through the &quot;Curva Grande&quot; down to the &quot;Variante della Roggia&quot; chicane in eighth gear, at . The braking point is just under the bridge. The kerbs are brutal and it is very easy for a car to become unbalanced and a driver to lose control, as Kimi Räikkönen did in 2005. This chicane is probably the best overtaking chance on the lap, as it is the only one with the &quot;slow corner, long straight, slow corner&quot;; one of the characteristics of modern circuits.
The &quot;Curve di Lesmo&quot; are two corners that are not as fast as they used to be, but are still challenging corners. The first is blind, entered at in sixth gear, apexing at , and has a slight banking. The second is a seventh gear entry at , apexing in fifth gear at , and it is very important that all the kerb is used. A mistake at one of these corners will result in a spin into the gravel, while good exits can set a driver up for an overtaking move into &quot;Variante Ascari&quot;.

The downhill straight down to &quot;Variante Ascari&quot; is very bumpy under the bridge. &quot;Variante Ascari&quot; is a very tricky sequence of corners and is key to the lap time.

The final challenge is the &quot;Curva Parabolica Alboreto&quot;: approaching at in eighth gear, cars quickly dance around the corner, apexing in sixth gear at and exiting in sixth gear at , accelerating onto the main start/finish straight. A good exit and slipstream off a fellow driver along the main straight can produce an overtaking opportunity under heavy braking into &quot;Variante del Rettifilo&quot;; however, it is difficult to follow a leading car closely through the &quot;Parabolica&quot; as the tow will reduce downforce and cornering speed.

The maximum speed recorded in a Formula One car was , established at the end of the start/finish straight. They experience a maximum g-force of 4.50 during deceleration, and the track has many dramatic high to low speed transitions.

<text>The Mexican Border Service Medal was a U.S. service medal established by an Act of Congress on July 9, 1918. It was awarded for service on the border between May 9, 1916 and March 24, 1917. Additionally, recipients included those who performed duty with the Mexican Border Patrol between January 1, 1916 and April 6, 1917.

==History==
The Mexican Border Service Medal recognized military service members who were assigned to the U.S.-Mexico border when the United States was engaged in the Pancho Villa Expedition, a military operation conducted against the paramilitary forces of Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa during the Mexican Revolution. The U.S.-Mexico border was a potential location for a German-funded invasion by Mexico, which was exposed by British interception of the Zimmerman Telegram, a communication that detailed Germany&#x27;s proposal for Mexico to ally with Germany if the United States entered World War I.

Those who received the Mexican Service Medal were not eligible for the Mexican Border Service Medal. The first recipient was Major General Charles M. Clement of Pennsylvania, in recognition of his status as the longest-tenured National Guard officer eligible for the award at the time it was authorized. Congress created a similar award for members of the Texas National Guard who served on the border between December 8, 1917 to November 11, 1918, the Texas Cavalry Medal.

==Description==
As approved by the U.S. Congress:

The medal of bronze is 1 1/4 inches in diameter. On the obverse is a sheathed Roman sword hanging on a tablet on which is inscribed &quot;For service on the Mexican border&quot;. The tablet is surrounded by a wreath. The reverse is the same as that of the Spanish War Service Medal. The medal is suspended by a ring from a silk moire ribbon 1 3/8 inches in length and 1 3/8 inches in width composed of a green band (7/16 inch), yellow band (1/2 inch), and green band (7/16 inch).

<text>William Paxson Purcell III (born October 25, 1953) is an American politician who served as the fifth mayor of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, elected first in 1999 and reelected to a second term in 2003. He is a member of the Democratic Party. On June 24, 2008 he was named director of Harvard University&#x27;s Institute of Politics (IOP) at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Purcell assumed the post on September 1, 2008. He was one of three co-chairs of the Harvard University Allston Work Team. He is now in private practice of law in Nashville and an adjunct professor of Public Policy at Vanderbilt University.

==Early life and education==
Purcell was born in 1953 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised in the nearby suburb of Wallingford, Pennsylvania. He attended Hamilton College in Clinton, New York where he served as Vice President of the Student Senate and was a columnist for the school newspaper. After graduating from Hamilton, Purcell attended law school at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. He received his Juris Doctor degree in 1979 and began practicing at the West Tennessee Legal Services agency in Jackson, Tennessee.

==Political history==
=== Tennessee legislature ===
In 1986, Purcell was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives where he served for five terms. As House Majority Leader and Chair of the Select Committee on Children and Youth, Purcell&#x27;s work in the legislature positioned him in the forefront of education, health care, workers compensation, and criminal sentencing reforms. 

=== Vanderbilt University ===
Purcell retired from the General Assembly in 1996 to become director of the Child and Family Policy Center at the Vanderbilt Institute of Public Policy Studies, a nationally recognized center building a bridge between academic research, politics, and best practices to benefit children and their families.

=== Mayor ===
Although many suspected that he would run for governor in 1998, Purcell instead announced that he would enter the race for Mayor of Metro Nashville. The incumbent mayor, Phil Bredesen, opted not to run for a third term after discovering that a 1994 amendment limiting city council members to two consecutive terms appeared to be worded in a way that made it apply to mayors as well. Purcell&#x27;s main challengers were former Mayor Richard Fulton and then Vice Mayor Jay West. In the general election, Purcell came up just short of an outright majority, forcing him into a runoff with Fulton, who announced he would not actively contest the ensuing runoff. The runoff still had to take place per state law, however, and Purcell won. He was sworn in as mayor on September 24. 

Purcell was reelected to a second term in 2003 with a record-setting 84.8 percent of the vote. Purcell is the second native Northerner to serve as mayor of Nashville (at least since the merger of Nashville and Davidson County in 1963); the first was Bredesen.

=== Retirement from public office ===
Purcell opted not to run for a third term due to the same amendment that led Bredesen to stand down after two terms, and stepped down at the end of his term in 2007. In the fall of 2007 he served as a fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Institute of Politics, and later as the Dean of the school of Public Service and Urban Affairs at Tennessee State University. He was succeeded as mayor by Metro&#x27;s law director, Karl Dean.

==Personal life==
Purcell and his wife Debbie Miller live in the historic Lockeland Springs neighborhood of East Nashville. Bill Purcell was a Board of Trustees Member at St. Bonaventure University from 2011 to 2020.

<doc id="952100" wikidata="Q1070016" url="?curid=952100" title="Persian name">
<text>A Persian name, or an Iranian name, consists of a given name (Persian: نام &quot;Nâm&quot;), sometimes more than one, and a surname (نام‌ خانوادگی).

==Given names==

Since the Muslim conquest of Persia, some names in Iran have been derived from Arabic, although the majority are Persian in origin. Persian Christians have Arabic names indistinguishable from their Muslim neighbors. They can also use Arabic derivations of Christian names (such as saints&#x27; names), or Greek, Neo-Aramaic, or Armenian names, as most Christian Iranians are Iranian Armenians, although there are also Iranian Assyrians and Iranian Georgians.

Many Persian names originate from the Persian literature book, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; or &quot;Epic of Kings&quot;. It was composed in the 10th century by Ferdowsi and is considered by many the masterpiece of Persian literature. Approximately 10%-15% of all Persian names are from Shahnameh. A few examples are Abtin, Amad, Ardeshir, Armeen, Arjang, Babak, Barzin, Bijan, Bozorgmehr, Dana (Zana), Darab, Dariush, Esfandiar, Javid, Faramarz, Farhad, Fariborz, Farshid and Sam.

==Last names==

Before 1919, the Iranian people did not use surnames. An act of the Vossug ed Dowleh government in 1919 introduced the use of surnames, and the practice expanded during the reign of Reza Shah (r. 1925–1941). Reza Shah passed a law making it mandatory to have surnames. He himself chose Pahlavi as of his surname, which has its roots in the Sassanid era. Prior to that, a person was often told apart from others by a combination of prefixes and suffixes attached to his or her name. If it was omitted, that person might be taken for someone else. Since the adoption of surnames, Ahmadi has become the most popular surname in Iran.

In many cases people were known by the name of the district, city, town, or even the village from which they came by using the locality&#x27;s name as a suffix, for example: Nuri, Khorasani, Mazandarani, Kordestani, Tehrani, Esfahani, Gilani, Hamedani, and Shirazi. The same rule is followed for the many millions of Iranians who have surnames of regions or cities of the Caucasus region. The latter was forcefully ceded in the course of the 19th century to Imperial Russia through the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828). Examples of common Iranian surnames in this regard are Daghestani, Qarabaghi, Darbandi, Shirvani, Iravani, Nakhjevani, Lankarani.

Among many other secularization and modernization reforms, surnames were enforced by Reza Shah, following similar contemporary patterns in Turkey under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and later in Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser.

* Aga Khan, hereditary title of the Imam of the Nizari branch of Isma&#x27;ilism. As a suffix, it indicates his children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.
* Mullah, Muslim cleric. The title has also been used in some Jewish communities to refer to the community&#x27;s leadership, especially religious leadership.
* Agha (title), Sir, mister. It is a general term of respect.

Surnames with &quot;-i&quot; are also popular in other countries of historic Greater Persia and neighboring countries like in the Caucasus, Pakistan, Turkey, Iraq, and Central Asia.
*-ian, like the above case, but with the addition of the plural suffix &quot;-an&quot;, common among Iranians and Armenians. Examples are Shaheenian (Persian) and Sargsyan (Armenian).

<text>Al-Marrakushi is a small, relatively isolated lunar impact crater in the eastern Mare Fecunditatis. It is a circular, symmetrical formation, with inner walls that slope down to the midpoint. To the northeast is the prominent crater Langrenus. The mare near Al-Marrakushi is marked by ray material from its larger neighbor.

This crater was identified as Langrenus D until it was given a name by the IAU in 1976. It was named after Abu Ali al-Hasan al-Marrakushi (fl. 2nd half of 13th century).

<text>Mary Beth Peil (; born June 25, 1940) is an American actress and soprano. She began her career as an opera singer in 1962 with the Goldovsky Opera Theater. In 1964 she won two major singing competitions, the Young Concert Artists International Auditions and the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions; the latter of which earned her a contract with the Metropolitan Opera National Company with whom she performed in two seasons of national tours as a leading soprano from 1965 to 1967. She continued to perform in operas through the 1970s, notably creating the role of Alma in the world premiere of Lee Hoiby&#x27;s &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; at the Minnesota Opera in 1971. She later recorded that role for American television in 1982. With that same opera company she transitioned into musical theatre, performing the title role of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot; Kiss Me, Kate&quot; in 1983. Later that year she joined the national tour of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot; as Anna Leonowens opposite Yul Brynner, and continued with that production when it opened on Broadway on January 7, 1985. She was nominated for a Tony Award for her portrayal.

After her Broadway debut, Peil has remained a stage actress in musicals and plays. She is the recipient of an Obie Award and has been nominated for a Drama Desk Award, a Helen Hayes Award, and two Outer Critics Circle Awards. She received a second Tony nomination in 2017 for her portrayal of Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in &quot;Anastasia&quot;. In 1992 she made her film debut in a small role in the movie &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, and made her first appearance on television in 1994 on the program &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. She is best known for her roles in the main casts of two television series: as Evelyn &#x27;Grams&#x27; Ryan in &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998–2003) and Jackie Florrick in &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2009–2016). Her notable film credits include portraying Jack Lemmon&#x27;s love interest in &quot;The Odd Couple II&quot; (1999), and performances in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (2004), &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2006), &quot;Mirrors&quot; (2008), &quot;Maladies&quot; (2012), and &quot;Collateral Beauty&quot; (2016). In 2020 she was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Performer in a Digital Drama Series for the role of Helen in &quot;After Forever&quot;.

== Early life ==
Peil (pronounced &quot;peel&quot;) was born in 1940 in Davenport, Iowa. She trained as a soprano at Northwestern University under Lotte Lehmann and gave her senior recital on April 9, 1962. Other influential teachers in her development in the university&#x27;s music department included Robert Gay, the director of the opera program, and Ewald Nolte, who taught courses in music theory and composition and conducted a university chorus in which Peil performed. While a college student she was a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority.

==Career==

=== Career as an opera and concert soprano: 1962–1982 ===
In her senior year, Peil performed the role of Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; in a student production directed by Gay at Northwestern; a performance which was attended by Boris Goldovsky. This led to an invitation to audition for Goldovsky&#x27;s opera company for an upcoming national tour of that opera. She was offered a contract, and moved to New York City in order to take that job. She made her professional debut as Violetta in the Fall of 1962 with the Goldovsky Opera Theater.

In 1964 Peil won two major singing contests, the Young Concert Artists International Auditions and the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions (MONCA), which significantly furthered her career as a classical soprano in concerts and opera. In March 1964 she won the MONCA which earned her a contract with the newly formed Metropolitan Opera National Company (MONC); a second touring company of the Metropolitan Opera. Mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens was one of the co-directors of the MONC, and Stevens mentored her during the two seasons that she performed with the company.

Peil made her opera debut with the MONC in September 1965 as Clorinda in Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;; going on to perform that role in 72 cities on a nine-month national tour with the MONC through May 1966. She also performed the role of Micaëla in Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; with the MONC that first season. She toured nationally with the company again in its second season as Susanna in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and Mimì in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; from September 1966 through May 1967; with periodic breaks during that period.

In 1965 Peil was the featured soprano soloist in a concert honoring Risë Stevens with the California Chamber Symphony at The Beverly Hilton. That same year she performed the role of Pamina in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; with conductor Thomas Scherman and the Little Orchestra Society at Philharmonic Hall. In 1966 she was the soprano soloist in performances of Christian Ignatius Latrobe&#x27;s &quot;Dies Irae&quot; at the Early American Moravian Music Festival at Salem College. In 1968 she made her much delayed New York recital debut at Weill Recital Hall of Carnegie Hall as part of her Young Concert Artists win from years earlier. She also sang with the New York City Opera, making her debut with the company in the Spring of 1972.

Peil performed as a chamber musician during the late 1960s and 1970s, often in conjunction with her then husband, the clarinetist Jerry Kirkbride. Both were members of the Divario Chamber Ensemble in 1969 and 1970. In 1976 the two of them were guest artists with the Boehm Quintette in a concert organized by the New York Flute Club entitled &quot;The Flute In American Music- A Concert commemorating the Bicentennial of the Independence of the United States&quot; at Carnegie Hall. On her own, she was the featured soprano soloist in a concert of Bach cantatas with the Hampshire Quartet at Alice Tully Hall in 1972. In the mid 1970s she performed with the Musical Arts Studio chamber opera ensemble, including performances at the Library of Congress in 1973. In 1977 she performed in a concert of Gerald Ginsburg&#x27;s &#x27;theatre lieder&#x27; at Alice Tully Hall.

In 1971, Peil originated the role of Alma in the world premiere of Lee Hoiby&#x27;s opera adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s play &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;, at the Minnesota Opera. She performed it again with the Chicago Opera Theater when it was broadcast on television in 1982 (based on a 1980 performance). She returned to the Minnesota Opera several more times. With that company she portrayed Leonora in the United States premiere of Carl Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Maskarade&quot; in 1972.

=== Transition to stage actress: 1983–1991 ===
Peil made a transition into musical theatre with the Minnesota Opera, performing the title role of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot; Kiss Me, Kate&quot; in 1983. Of that experience Peil stated, &quot;That was when the light bulb went on. Doing &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; with my beloved John Reardon made me realize I was a singing actor, not an acting singer.&quot;

She soon found herself on Broadway. In May 1983 she was cast in a national tour as the twelfth and final Anna Leonowens opposite Yul Brynner&#x27;s monarch of Siam in a revival of &quot;The King and I&quot;. The production toured the United States, closing on Broadway shortly before Brynner&#x27;s death in 1985. In an interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she described how Brynner could barely walk from his dressing room to the stage, due to his radiation therapy to treat his cancer, but when it was time to go on he somehow managed; &quot;gliding into the light, erect, with the body of a sleek jungle cat&quot;. She was nominated for a 1985 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical. She later returned to the role of Anna Leonowens for a revival of the musical at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in 1990 with Stacy Keach as the King.

In 1986 Peil starred in Michel Tremblay&#x27;s play &quot;The Impromptu of Outremont&quot; at the Lincoln Theater on the campus of the University of Hartford. She starred in the 1987 off-Broadway musical &quot;Birds of Paradise&quot;. In 1988 she portrayed Desiree Armfeldt in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; with the Opera Ensemble of New York. In 1989 she performed in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; at The Public Theater under the direction of JoAnne Akalaitis. She portrayed President J.F.K.&#x27;s secretary, a central character in the musical, in Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s &quot;Over Texas&quot; with the Ensemble Studio Theatre in 1991. That same year she starred in Ödön von Horváth&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot; at the Actors Theater of Louisville.

=== Career on screen and stage: 1992–2003 ===
In 1993 Peil moved back to New York City after divorcing Jerry Kirkbride with whom she had raised two children, Gwyneth and Michael, in Leonia, New Jersey. She had made her film debut earlier in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; and her television debut on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 1994. Her first larger role in film was in the 1995 independent drama film &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. She portrayed Felice, the love interest of Felix (played by Jack Lemmon), in the 1999 comedy film &quot;The Odd Couple II&quot;. She portrayed Nancy Reagan&#x27;s mother, actress Edith Luckett, in the Showtime movie &quot;The Reagans&quot; (2003). Between 1998 and 2003, she was introduced to a wider audience through her role as Evelyn &#x27;Grams&#x27; Ryan on the teen television drama &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Alongside the four main young stars of that show, she was the only actress to appear as a credited regular throughout the show&#x27;s six-season run, appearing in 74 of 128 episodes.

Peil continued in the theatre while branching out into television and film. In 1992 she portrayed the beggar woman in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; at the Paper Mill Playhouse with George Hearn as Sweeney and Judy Kaye as Mrs. Lovett. That same year she appeared in the premiere of Romulus Linney&#x27;s &quot;Democracy and Esther&quot;; an adaptation of Henry Adams&#x27;s novels &quot;&quot; (1880) and &quot;Esther&quot; (1884) into a single play. She starred in the premiere of another play by Linney in 1993, the role of the psychoanalyst in &quot;Spain&quot;. In 1994 she starred in three one act plays by Edward Albee presented collectively under the tile &quot;Sand&quot; by the Signature Theatre Company: &quot;Box&quot; (1968), &quot;The Sandbox&quot; (1960), and &quot;Finding the Sun&quot; (1983).

Peil won an Obie Award in 1995 for her work in three non-musical plays off-Broadway: Paul Rudnick&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (as Nan, 1994 at the WPA Theater), A. R.

<doc id="952110" wikidata="Q1639847" url="?curid=952110" title="Trockenbeerenauslese">
<text>Trockenbeerenauslese (, ), or TBA, is a German or Austrian botrytized wine made entirely from the individually selected grapes fully &quot;dried&quot; from Botrytis cinerea (&quot;noble rot&quot;), hence the name. &quot;Trockenbeerenauslese&quot; is a very sweet wine, highest among the wines of the QmP (&quot;quality wine with distinction&quot;) category that includes also Auslese and Beerenauslese.

==Vintage==
The grapes for TBA are individually picked among shrivelled with noble rot, often to the point of appearing like a raisin. The shrivelling might causes the content to become concentrated, very sweet and have an intensely rich flavour, frequently with a lot of caramel and honey bouquet, stone fruit notes such as apricot, and distinctive aroma of the noble rot. The finest examples are made from the Riesling grape, as this variety retains plenty of acidity even at the extreme ripeness, and therefore age well. Other grape varieties can benefit from noble rot, such as Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon&quot;.

The TBA wines are very rare. The best of them are among the sweetest (up to 300 grams/liter) and most expensive dessert wines, often with low alcohol content (6-8% ABV). The high cost is caused by multiple factors:
* the onset of Botrytis is unpredictable, highly dependent on weather and location (down to an individual cluster of grapes);
* the pickers therefore have to go through the vineyards multiple times, cherry-picking clusters and sometimes individual grapes.
The very specific climatic conditions (which do not necessarily occur every year) are required to create botrytized grapes. They are usually golden to deep golden in color, sometimes even dark caramel. The body is viscous, very thick and concentrated, and arguably can be aged almost indefinitely due to the preservative powers of its high sugar content. Like other botrytized wines, the finest TBAs, despite very high sugar content, are far from being cloying due to a high level of acidity.

==Austria==
Austria, once known for its Ausbruch, have adopted the German wine specifications, so &quot;Trockenbeerenauslese&quot; have also been in common production since the 1960s. Most TBA wines from Austria come from Neusiedlersee and Burgenland (actually, Neusiedlersee–Hügelland, an official wine region name that is rarely used), regions on both sides of lake Neusiedl. East of the lake, the village of Illmitz is known for the production of &quot;liquid gold&quot;. At the western side of the lake in Rust and St. Margarethen, wine of exceptionally good quality can be found. This region is known for its wide and shallow lakes which can lose more than half their volume due to evaporation. The mists created by these lakes provide a very conducive climate for noble rot to shrivel grapes.

The style is similar to, but much more concentrated than, &quot;Sélection de Grains Nobles&quot; from Alsace.

The wines are much more acidic compared to Sauternes (and similar to Tokaji), are considerably sweeter, have a lower alcoholic strength and are usually not matured in oak barrels.

As with most other premium grade dessert wines, &quot;Trockenbeerenauslese&quot; is to a large extent sold in half bottles of 375 ml.

== Requirements ==
The minimum must weight requirements for &quot;Trockenbeerenauslese&quot; is as follows:
* For Mosel-produced wine, at least 150 degrees on the Oechsle scale are required;
* In Austrian wine, 30 degrees KMW (approximately the same value).

The requirements are part of the wine law in both countries. Many producers, especially top-level producers, exceed the minimum requirements, resulting in richer and sweeter wines. In Germany it is common to add a golden capsule to indicate a superior wine. The sweetness of a TBA that just comes up to the minimum requirements may be 150 grams per liter, but in exceptional circumstances, the wines may contain more than 300 grams of sugar per liter and may approach the very rare &quot;Tokaji Eszencia&quot; in concentration.

<text>Roncesvalles ( , ; ; ; ; ) is a small village and municipality in Navarre, northern Spain. It is situated on the small river Urrobi at an altitude of some in the Pyrenees, about from the French border as the crow flies, or by road.

==History==
===Battle of Roncevaux===
Roncesvalles is famous in history and legend for the death of Roland in 778, during the Battle of Roncevaux Pass, when Charlemagne&#x27;s rearguard was destroyed by Basque tribes.

When a party of horsemen from the Kingdom of Navarre arrived at the Duchy of Burgundy in 1439 to negotiate Prince Charles of Navarre&#x27;s marriage to Agnes of Cleves, the Duke of Burgundy&#x27;s niece, the prior of Roncesvalles was their chief ambassador. He was described as a &quot;noble knight&quot;.

The small collegiate church contains several curious relics associated with Roland. The battle is said to have been fought in the valley known as Valcarlos, which is now occupied by a hamlet bearing the same name, and in the adjoining pass of Ibañeta (Roncevaux Pass). Both of these are traversed by the main road leading north from Roncesvalles to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, in the French Basque Country.

===Santa María de Roncesvalles===
Since the Middle Ages, this collegiate church of Santa María de Orreaga/Roncesvalles has been a favorite resting place for Catholic pilgrims along the French Way path, the most popular variant of the Way of St. James, since it is the first place to have a rest after crossing the French Pyrenees. The church, a former pilgrim&#x27;s hospice, was built at the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth centuries. The oldest building is the Chapel of Sancti Spiritus, or &quot;Charlemagne&#x27;s Silo&quot; built in Romanesque style in the 12th century.

Every year thousands of pilgrims begin their way to Santiago de Compostela at Roncesvalles.

The area was also the site of the 1813 Battle of Roncesvalles during the Peninsular War.

<doc id="952113" wikidata="Q696796" url="?curid=952113" title="M7 Priest">
<text>The 105 mm howitzer motor carriage M7 was an American self-propelled artillery vehicle produced during World War II. It was given the service name 105 mm self propelled, Priest by the British Army, due to the pulpit-like machine gun ring, and following on from the Bishop and the contemporary Deacon self-propelled guns.

== Design and development ==
During the early stages of World War II, US Army observers realized that they would need a self-propelled artillery vehicle with sufficient firepower to support armored operations. Lessons learned with half-tracks (such as the T19 howitzer motor carriage (HMC) with a 105 mm howitzer on the M3 half-track chassis) also showed that this vehicle would have to be armored and fully tracked. It was decided to use the M3 Lee chassis as the basis for this new vehicle design, named T32. The pilot vehicles used the M3 chassis with an open-topped superstructure, mounting an M2A1 105 mm howitzer, with a machine-gun added after trials.

The T32 was accepted for service as the M7 in February 1942 and production began that April. The British Tank Mission had requested 2,500 to be delivered by the end of 1942 and a further 3,000 by the end of 1943, an order which was never fully completed.

As the M4 Sherman tank replaced the M3, it was decided to continue production using the M4 chassis (the M4 chassis was a development of the M3). The M7 was subsequently supplanted by the M37 105 mm howitzer motor carriage (on the &quot;light combat team&quot; chassis that also gave the M24 Chaffee light tank).

==Operational history==
A total of 3,489 M7s and 826 M7B1s were built. They proved to be reliable weapons, continuing to see front-line service in the US and other armies well past the end of World War II.

=== North Africa ===
During the North African campaign, 90 M7s were received by the British Eighth Army in North Africa, which was also the first to use it, during the Second Battle of El Alamein, alongside the Bishop, a self-propelled gun based on the 87.6 mm calibre Ordnance QF 25-pounder gun-howitzer.

The British Commonwealth armies had logistical problems in supplying the M7, as it used US ammunition that was not compatible with standard British artillery pieces or tank guns, and had to be supplied separately. Whereas the Sexton – a rival self-propelled gun developed in Canada - featured the standard British QF 25-pounder (on an M3 or M4 chassis).

Despite supply problems, British Commonwealth forces used the M7 throughout the campaigns in North Africa and Italy.

=== Northwest Europe ===
During the invasion of Normandy, from June 1944, the artillery regiments of the British 3rd and 50th divisions, and the Canadian 3rd Division were equipped with the M7; however, these were replaced by towed 25-pounder guns in early August.

During the Battle of the Bulge, each US armored division had three battalions of M7s, giving them unparalleled mobile artillery support.

===Pacific War===
The M7 was also used by US and British forces in Pacific and Asian theaters.

During the Burma campaign, the Priest played a significant role, in particular, at the Battle of Meiktila and the advance on Rangoon (1945).

From early 1944 it was used in the South West Pacific theater, by the US Sixth Army in the later stages of the campaign in New Guinea and surrounding islands. The M7 also saw action in the Philippines campaign, with the US Eighth and Sixth armies.

=== After World War II ===
Korean War
M7 Priests remained in use during the Korean War, where their flexibility, compared to towed artillery units, led the US Army on the path to converting fully to self-propelled howitzers. The limited gun elevation of the M7 (35 degrees) hampered its ability to shoot over the tall Korean mountains, so 127 M7B1s were modified to permit the full 65 degrees elevation in a model known as the M7B2. After the Korean War, many of these were exported to NATO countries, notably Italy and Germany.

Israel
Israel acquired a number of M7 Priests during the 1960s and employed them in the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War where three M7 units, the 822nd, 827th and 829th Battalions in the IDF Northern Command, supported operations in the Golan Heights.

West Germany
The new West German received 127 Priests as its first self-propelled artillery vehicle. They entered service in 1956 and were used until the early 1960s.

==Variants==

;M7
:The first M7s produced were based on modified M3 Lee medium tank chassis. To maintain a low silhouette, the howitzer elevation had to be restricted to 35°. In May 1942, after only a month of production, the vehicle was altered to increase its ammunition stowage from 57 to 69 rounds. This was achieved by placing seven rounds on the left wall and five on the right. The M7 also went through a fairly rapid shift from being based on the M3, to having more commonality with the M4 Sherman. The first major example was an adoption of the M4&#x27;s three-piece housing, single-piece casting and suspension. In British service, some M7s carried a radio set, which took the place of 24 rounds of ammunition.
;M7B1
:Completing the shift, the M7B1 was fully based on the M4A3 Sherman chassis. 826 M7B1 were produced from March 1944 to February 1945.
;M7B2
:During the Korean War, the limited elevation of the howitzer became noticeably problematic. 127 M7B1 were modified to permit an elevation of 65° to increase the effective range of the howitzer. The machine gun mount also had to be raised to give a 360° firing arc.

;&quot;Defrocked Priest&quot;
:As one part of the Allied effort to capture Falaise and break out from the Normandy beachhead, 72 M7s had their main guns removed in the field for service as armoured personnel carriers and were first used in Operation Totalize. These field modified vehicles were referred to as &quot;Defrocked Priests&quot;, &quot;Unfrocked Priests&quot; or as &quot;Holy Rollers&quot;. The work was done in one week by 250 personnel from 14 British and Canadian Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer units. 36 vehicles each were allocated to the 4th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Canadian Division and the 154th (Highland) Brigade of the 51st (Highland) Division, which led the attack.
;Kangaroo
:A Canadian armored personnel carrier conversion of the M7 for use by British and Commonwealth units in northern Europe. The Kangaroo could carry 20 infantry plus a crew of two. A total of 102 were converted between October 1944 and April 1945. The name &quot;Kangaroo&quot; became generic for all conversions of armored fighting vehicles into personnel carriers, including Ram tank conversions.
;25pdr howitzer motor carriage T51
:M7 fitted with 25 pounder gun in July 1942.

A British self-propelled gun armed with the Ordnance QF 25-pounder in design from 1941 was nicknamed Bishop as its appearance was said to resemble a bishop&#x27;s mitre and a replacement, the US 105 mm howitzer motor carriage M7, was called &quot;Priest&quot;, as part of its superstructure was said to resemble a pulpit. Following this line of names, a 1942 self-propelled gun armed with the QF 6 pounder was named Deacon and a 1943 weapon carrier with the QF 25-pounder was called Sexton.

<doc id="952114" wikidata="Q1087239" url="?curid=952114" title="Christ Stopped at Eboli">
<text>Christ Stopped at Eboli () is a memoir by Carlo Levi, published in 1945, giving an account of his exile from 1935–1936 to Grassano and Aliano, remote towns in Southern Italy, in the region of Lucania which is known today as Basilicata. In the book he gives Aliano the invented name Gagliano (based on the local pronunciation of Aliano).

&quot;The title of the book comes from an expression by the people of Gagliano who say of themselves, &#x27;Christ stopped short of here, at Eboli&#x27; which means, in effect, that they feel they have been bypassed by Christianity, by morality, by history itself—that they have somehow been excluded from the full human experience.&quot; Levi explained that Eboli, a location in the region of Campania to the west near the seacoast, is where the road and railway to Basilicata branched away from the coastal north–south routes.

==Background ==
Carlo Levi was a doctor, writer and painter, a native of Turin. In 1935, Levi&#x27;s anti-fascist beliefs and activism led to his banishment by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government to a period of internal exile in a remote region of southern Italy. Despite his status as a political exile Levi was welcomed with open arms, for the people of this area were naturally gracious hosts. His book, &quot;Christ Stopped At Eboli&quot;, focuses on his year in the villages of the Lucania region and the people he encountered there.

==Grassano and Gagliano ==
The villages of Grassano and Gagliano were extremely poor. They lacked basic goods because they had no shops. The typical meager diet consisted of bread, oil, crushed tomatoes, and peppers. The villages did not have many modern items, and those they did were not often used. The one public toilet (and only bathroom) in town did not have running water, and stood as a retreat for animals rather than people. Also, there was only one car in the area. Homes were sparsely furnished; the most frequent decoration was an American dollar, a photo of US president Roosevelt, or the Madonna di Viggiano displayed on their walls. Health care was atrocious. The two doctors in town were inept. The peasants did not trust them and counted on Levi&#x27;s medical skills instead, though he was reluctant, and hadn’t practiced in years. Malaria took the lives of many villagers. Education was available, but the mayor who taught class spent more time smoking on the balcony than teaching the children.

The religious values were a mix of Catholicism and mysticism. While people were pious in the sense that they were moral and kind, they were motivated by beliefs in magic and mysticism more than religion. They rarely attended church, and in fact ostracized their priest, who was a drunk, and whose reputation had been ruined early in his career after he had sexual relations with a young student; he had been banished from one place to another for years, and eventually ended up in Gagliano. The priest, however, had just as much dislike for the locals, calling them &quot;donkeys, not Christians.&quot; It seems Christianity was not fully embraced. Superstitions, gnomes, and spells seemed to shape daily life, rather than Christian beliefs. People did, however, attend church on holidays, and did respect the Madonna.

== Lucania: fascism and wars ==
The southern part of Italy did not completely support Mussolini and his fascist government, while northeners looked down on southerners and saw them as inferior citizens. Southerners felt torn from Italy, and looked instead towards America as a beacon of hope and prosperity. Levi writes: ”New York, rather than Rome or Naples would be the real capital of the peasants of Lucania, if these men without a country could have a capital at all.” 

In 1935, when Italy started a war in Abyssinia (present day Ethiopia), the villagers were indifferent, and it did not affect them. Levi mentions only one man who enlisted to escape his troubled life at home. He notes, however, that the villagers also did not talk about World War I, even though many locals lost their lives.

Near the end of his stay Levi travels north for a funeral. After almost a year in Lucania, he feels an awkwardness he had not experienced before. Talking politics with friends and acquaintances, he discovers their ignorance of southern issues, listening to them talk about ”the problems of the south”, who is to blame, and what can and should be done. They all think the state must take action – ”something concretely useful, and beneficent, and miraculous”. Levi chalks this up to fourteen years’ worth of fascist indoctrination, which has subconciously ingrained in them the idea of a united, utopian Italy.

==Film adaptation==

In 1979, the book was adapted into a film, directed by Francesco Rosi and starring Gian Maria Volonté as Carlo Levi.

<text>Kuiper ( ) is a small lunar impact crater in a relatively featureless part of the Mare Cognitum. It is a circular, cup-shaped feature with only some minor wear. It was named after Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper in 1976. Kuiper was the Project Scientist for the Ranger program. This crater was previously identified as Bonpland E. The lava-flooded crater Bonpland lies to the east at the edge of the Mare Cognitum.

To the east-southeast of Kuiper crater is the crash landing site of the Ranger 7 probe, the first American spacecraft to photograph the Moon.

<text>Paul Piché (born September 5, 1953) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, environmentalist and political activist

He mostly composes on acoustic guitar, although some of his recent work has had some electronica sound input. Many of his songs have become classics of the Québécois repertoire at cabaret nights, parties, camp fires, and especially at Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day celebrations.

Piché studied archaeology at the Université de Montréal, and in the early 1970s sang in Quebec colleges. In 1977 the keyboardist Robert Léger of Beau Dommage encouraged him to record his first LP, &quot;À qui appartient le beau temps&quot;, which sold more than 100,000 copies.

In 1980, Piché releases his second album, &quot;L’escalier&quot;, which was inspired by his trip down the staircase in René Lévesque Boulevard.

From then on, Piché began working with the keyboardist Michel Hinton (also from Beau Dommage). His single &quot;Tous les vents&quot;, reached second place on the Radio-activité chart in August 1984 and his album &quot;Nouvelles d&#x27;Europe&quot; won the Félix Award for best rock album of 1985. In 1986 he performed with Michel Rivard and released a double album, &quot;Intégral&quot;, which is a collection of all his works. He then travelled throughout Quebec and performed at the festivals of Millénaire in Brussels, in La Rochelle, and in Nyon, Switzerland.

&quot;Sur le chemin des incendies&quot;, which sold more than 100,000 copies, revealed a more personal facet of the songwriter. Many pieces were written in collaboration with the guitarist Rick Haworth. &quot;J&#x27;appelle&quot;, reached first place on the Radio activité chart in December 1988.

Piché participated in the St-Jean Baptiste nationalist gatherings in 1990 on the Plains of Abraham of Quebec City, and on St. Helen&#x27;s Island in Montreal. Often associated with the great names of the Quebec chanson, Piché participated in La Fête à Vigneault at the Francofolies of Montreal in 1990, which celebrated the 30-year-career of the national poet. Montreal&#x27;s &quot;La Presse&quot; proclaimed Piché &#x27;Personality of the Year&#x27; in the song category.

Journalist Laurent Saulnier stated that Piché was the missing link between Bruce Springsteen and Jacques Brel, &quot;an original mixture of French song, American rock, and Quebec folklore&quot;. (&quot;Voir&quot;, February 23, 1989).

In 2016, during the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, he performed after Triple Rock, a group that is made out of Théo, Yoopa and Benoît Archambault. From June 17 to 19, 2018, Paul had performed at the City Center in Saint-Constant, Quebec after Alexis Arbour.

<text>The Shanghai International Circuit (), also called the SAIC Shanghai International Circuit () for sponsorship purposes, is a motorsport race track, situated in the Jiading District, Shanghai, China. The circuit is best known as the venue for the annual Chinese Grand Prix which was hosted from 2004 to 2019, and from 2024.

The Shanghai International Circuit features over 10 top-tier domestic car racing events annually. It also boasts Shanghai&#x27;s only world-class outdoor go-karting track.

As a nationally recognized 4A-rated tourist attraction, the circuit features tourism, shopping, dining, entertainment, and sports.

==History==
Shanghai International Circuit was conceived by the Shanghai authorities as a way to showcase the city to the world. A 5.3 sq km site was chosen in the Jiading District in the north west of the city, close to major car parts manufacturing facilities and a budget of 2.6 billion yuan ($450 million) raised through a government-funded joint-venture company, the Shanghai Jiushi Group.

Herman Tilke was chosen to design the track and associated buildings, and between April and May 2003, engineers visited the site to draw up their plans. The site was actually a swampland, previously used as rice paddy fields, and extensive groundworks had to be completed to construct the circuit. For 18 months some 3,000 workers were on site daily to complete the facility – a remarkable feat of both engineering and logistics.

When it opened, visitors found a vast complex, dominated by the main grandstand and pit complex, which featured wing-like viewing platforms crossing the circuit at either end. This can hold 30,000 spectators alone, and others around the circuit take the total capacity to 200,000. Paddock facilities were also unique – each of the F1 teams had its own building, arranged like pavilions in a lake to resemble the ancient Yu Garden in Shanghai.

The Shanghai International Circuit is the first in China to be purpose-built for Formula One and it hosts FIA Formula One World Championship Chinese Grand Prix every year since 2004. The circuit also holds a number of global high-profile series, including the FIA World Endurance Championship and the Blancpain GT Series Asia.

In the past, the circuit has hosted the MotoGP world championship, and a one-off V8 Supercars China Round of the Australian-based V8 Supercar championship in 2005, and also the final round of the A1 Grand Prix in 2006/2007.

In 2011, the Shanghai International Circuit signed a sponsorship deal with Audi and was subsequently named the Shanghai Audi International Circuit and the SAIC International Circuit following a deal with SAIC Motor.
==Layout==

The track layout was inspired from the Chinese character shang (上), the first character in the name of the city Shanghai, meaning &quot;above&quot; or &quot;ascend&quot;.

There’s a unique start to the lap as the drivers fly into the ever-tightening Turns 1 and 2, before they dart left through 3 and 4. The super-high g force Turns 7 and 8 are loved by the drivers, while the circuit also features one of the longest straights on the calendar, the stretch that separates turns 13 and 14.

==A lap in a Formula One car==

The first two bends make a right-hand curve which leads immediately into turns 3 and 4 taken at . One and two are far more difficult – a lift on entry followed by various taps of the throttle and brakes are needed so the car maintains balance throughout. It also becomes blind towards the middle of the corner. Three and four are less complicated, with three being a simple hairpin, but a good exit is needed from four to gain speed down the following straight and through turn 5. The complex of turns 1–4 makes up the first of two &quot;snails&quot; on the circuit, the other being turns 11–13. Turn 6 is a second gear, right-handed hairpin with plentiful run-off. Turns 7 and 8 make up a high speed chicane – the left-right complex sees a constant G-force of 3 and a minimum speed of about . Turns 9 and 10 immediately follow – two slow left-handers which require a good exit to gain speed down the next straight. Turns 11 and 12 effectively make up a slow left-right chicane where the use of kerbs are important but traction is low. Turn 13 is a very long right-hander which becomes less and less tight, and a very good exit is important as DRS is available down the following straight. At , it is the equivalent to 11 football pitches laid end to end, or the same length as three and a half of the world&#x27;s biggest aircraft carriers Turn 14 is a hairpin at the end of the straight – the second gear corner is a prime overtaking spot as DRS is available in the run up to the corner. Turn 16 is the last corner – a fourth-gear left-hander which requires a quick tap on the brakes – braking early can be more effective as you can then carry more speed through the corner and then down the pit straight.

<doc id="952151" wikidata="Q609429" url="?curid=952151" title="C64 Direct-to-TV">
<text>The C64 Direct-to-TV, called C64DTV for short, is a single-chip implementation of the Commodore 64 computer, contained in a joystick (modeled after the mid-1980s Competition Pro joystick), with 30 built-in games. The design is similar to the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Game. The circuitry of the C64DTV was designed by Jeri Ellsworth, a computer chip designer who had previously designed the C-One.

Tulip Computers (which had acquired the Commodore brand name in 1997) licensed the rights to Ironstone Partners, which cooperated with DC Studios and Mammoth Toys in the development and marketing of the unit. Released in late 2004, QVC purchased the entire first production run of 250,000 units and sold 70,000 of them on the first day that they were offered.

==Versions==
There exist multiple versions of the C64DTV. DTV1 (NTSC television type) comes with 2 MB ROM. It first appeared in late 2004 for the American/Canadian market. DTV2 (called &quot;C64D2TV&quot; sometimes) is a revised version for the European and world markets (PAL television type) and appeared in late 2005. The ROM has been replaced by flash memory in these devices. However, the DTV2/PAL version suffers from a manufacturing fault, which results in poor colour rendering (the resistors in the R-2R ladder DACs for both the chroma and the luma have been transposed). In the DTV3, a problem with the blitter was fixed.

==Hardware specifications==

* Core circuitry
** ASIC running at 32 MHz internally, implementing 6510 CPU, VIC-II, SID, CIA, and PLA
* Casing/Connectors
** integrated in a joystick (as if connected to port 2 of a real C64)
** five additional buttons (acting like keys)
** running from batteries only (four AA batteries)
** Composite video, monaural audio (RCA connectors)
** looks similar to a &quot;Competition Pro&quot; joystick
* Graphics
** NTSC (DTV2 and later: NTSC/PAL on chip, only PAL wired in end-market devices)
** reprogrammable palette with 4 bits of luma and 4 bits of chroma
** DTV2 and later: &quot;chunky&quot; 256 color mode, additional blitter for fast image transformation
* Sound
** no support for SID filters
** DTV2 and later: 8 bit digital sound, additional options for envelope generators
* Memory
** DTV1: 128 KB RAM, 2 MB ROM
** DTV2 and later: 2 MB RAM, 2 MB flash memory
** DMA engine for RAM/RAM and ROM/RAM transfers
** DTV2 and later: additional RAM access using bank switching and blitter
* CPU
** implementing a 6510 at 1 MHz
** DTV2 and later: Enhanced CPU (fast/burst mode, additional registers and opcodes, support for illegal ops of the 6510)

==Built-in games==

The official games for the unit are mostly a mix of Epyx and Hewson C64 games. Games unique to the NTSC or PAL versions are noted below.

==Hardware-modding==
Since the internal circuit board has exposed solder points for floppy-drive and keyboard ports, hardware modifications of the C64DTV are relatively simple.

Known hardware mods
* Keyboard connector
* External joystick (Port 1 and 2)
* Floppy connector
* Power unit connector
* Fixing the palette problems of the PAL version (to some degree this is possible in software by adjusting palette entries)
* S-Video connector
* User port
* Original C64 casing and PS2 keyboard 
Additional hardware
* Data transfer cable (Parallel port (or USB/serial port via DTV2ser) to Joystick or user port)
* SD card interface &quot;1541-III&quot; or &quot;MMC2IEC&quot;

==Limitations==
The internal flash memory is accessible as device 1. However, software is not included to support write operations so high-score saving is not possible. Also, flash devices used in the DTV are specified for a very limited number of write accesses only.

When using the standard keyboard mod, the F7 key does not work. There is a workaround, the &quot;Keyboard Twister.&quot;

==Software-modding==
The DTV contains software-flashable memory. A number of tools have been released to compile programs into DTV-compatible flash images and load it onto the DTV. People made their own game compilations, adding popular (sometimes DTV-fixed) games that were not in the original DTV, added boot menus to make homebrew software development easier or enable new features, for example transfer programs like DTVtrans for transferring data from PC to DTV RAM and vice versa via the PC parallel port (or USB) and the DTV joystick port.

<text>Izzy and Moe is a 1985 American made-for-television comedy-crime film starring Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. It is a fictional account of two actual Prohibition-era policemen, Izzy Einstein and Moe Smith, and their adventures in tracking down illegal bars and gangsters. The film was originally broadcast on CBS on September 23, 1985.

==Plot==
During the Prohibition era of the 1920s, a gangster named John Vanderhoff, alias &quot;The Dutchman&quot; (based on real-life gangster Dutch Schultz, was killing off the competition and setting up his own speakeasys. To fight back, the Prohibition Bureau needed to get some extra men. Former vaudeville entertainer Izzy Einstein (Jackie Gleason) volunteers; he is desperate to have a steady paycheck to support his wife, mother-in-law, and four daughters. Einstein also wants to disprove his mother-in-law&#x27;s claim that he is just a &quot;bum&quot;.

When the agent in charge of the local Prohibition Unit office asks Izzy why he wants to sign on for a dangerous job, especially at his age, Einstein makes a speech: &quot;This is America. And I&#x27;m &quot;proud&quot; to be an American...&quot; The chief reluctantly hires Einstein when he makes a convincing argument that, unlike the trim agents in the unit, Izzy&#x27;s regular guy status (and his various skills from vaudeville) can make him a good inside man for undercover work. In response to the chief&#x27;s concern that he is still &quot;too old&quot; for the job, Izzy quickly suggests taking a partner. Moe Smith (Art Carney), Izzy&#x27;s old vaudeville partner, recently had his underground bar raided by the police and is spending too much time alone and drinking. Einstein meets with Smith and asks for his help. Despite their testy friendship and Moe&#x27;s similar concern that they are too old for that type of work, the idea of a steady paycheck convinces him.

When they first try to raid one of Dutch&#x27;s bars, they find the gangster has converted it into a &quot;reading hall&quot;. Izzy and Moe decide to use different tactics. After spotting a local baseball team, they ask their boss for 9 more men. They all dress as baseball players, and tell the gatekeeper at the bar they want to celebrate a win. They gain entry and enjoy it - then whip out their badges and arrest everyone in the bar.

Soon, Izzy and Moe have their own division within the unit; they work alone as a pair, get various costumes, and offer no explanations of their tactics. Izzy and Moe soon successfully raid underground bars all over the city, and arrest such high-profile people as the district attorney. After their boss threatens to fire them, Izzy and Moe meet the press, and Izzy gives his &quot;This is America&quot; speech. They are reinstated. After another high-profile arrest lands them in hot water, the chief orders them to do their next assignments by the book and with decorum. They respond by infiltrating a church disguised as an aging couple (with Moe in drag) getting married.

Moe, a widower, is attracted to Dallas Carter, an entertainer at one of the Dutchman&#x27;s bars. He falls in love. Upset at losing so much money and booze to the cops, Dutch lures the pair to where a large shipment of bourbon is being kept. Izzy and Moe evade the trap, but Moe gets shot in the arm, and one of the agents is killed. The agent&#x27;s death affects Moe, who had considered quitting again to be with Dallas, but he decides to stay, giving his own version of the &quot;This is America&quot; speech to reporters. Izzy and Moe then proceeded to rob the Dutch&#x27;s big shipment of Bourbon that he was expecting, with help from Dallas, and also take the truck and its treasure to a police impound site.

Unbeknownst to Izzy and Moe, their boss, the unit chief, turns out to be on The Dutchman&#x27;s payroll; it was his tips that helped The Dutchman stay one step ahead of the unit. After the chief tips The Dutchman about Dallas tipping off the shipment, Dutch takes her hostage and tells Izzy and Moe to bring the bourbon for an exchange. They go to his estate, dodging the bullets and capturing the corrupt police chief. When Moe confronts Dutch, the gangster is pointing a gun at Dallas&#x27; head. Moe offers himself; with Dutch about to shoot him, a gun blast knocks the gun away. Izzy emerges from hiding with a rifle. When Moe asks him, &quot;How could you chance taking a shot like that?&quot;, Izzy, recalling a William Tell routine they had done in vaudeville responds, &quot;I just pretended he had an apple on your head.&quot;

The movie ends with Izzy&#x27;s mother-in-law lighting Izzy&#x27;s cigar inside a store window display, with Izzy&#x27;s family, Moe, and Dallas watching (a reference to a sarcastic promise she had frequently made to her son-in-law if he ever finally made something of himself.)

<text>Arditi (from the Italian verb &quot;ardire&quot;, &#x27;to dare&#x27;, and translates as &quot;The Daring [Ones]&quot;) was the name adopted by a Royal Italian Army elite special force of World War I. They and the opposing German &quot;Stormtroopers&quot; were the first modern shock troops, and they have been called &quot;the most feared corps by opposing armies&quot;.

&quot;Reparti d&#x27;Assalto&quot; (&#x27;Assault units&#x27;) were formed in the summer of 1917 by Colonel Bassi, and were assigned the tactical role of shock troops, breaching enemy defenses in order to prepare the way for a broad infantry advance. The Arditi were not units within infantry divisions, but were considered a separate combat arm.

The &quot;Reparti d&#x27;Assalto&quot; were successful in bringing in a degree of movement to what had previously been a war of entrenched positions. They won numerous engagements armed mainly with daggers and hand grenades, which proved very effective in the confined space of a trench. Their exploits on the battlefield were exemplary and they gained an illustrious place in Italian military history. They were demobilized by 1920.

The name &quot;Arditi&quot; was later used in 1919–20 by the Italian occupiers of Fiume who were led by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, most of whom had been members of the Royal Italian Army. Their use of a uniform with black ties, insignia and fez was later taken up by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s paramilitary forces, the Blackshirts. In 1942, during the Second World War, the 10th Arditi Regiment was created, inspired by the assault units of the Great War.

From 1 October 1975 the flag of X Arditi Regiment was adopted by the 9th Paratroopers Assault Regiment &quot;Col Moschin&quot;. To this day, operatives of Col Moschin and Italian commando frogmen are known as &quot;Arditi Incursori&quot; and are viewed as the heirs of the Arditi.

==World War I==

===Early experiments===

The first special units within the Italian Army can be traced back to 1914 when every regiment of the Royal Army was ordered to create a group of explorers trained to act behind enemy lines. One of the most famous units of this type was the Baseggio Company that attacked Monte Sant&#x27;Osvaldo in 1916.

Others argue that the so-called &quot;Compagnie della morte&quot; (&#x27;Companies of death&#x27;), special patrols of infantry and engineers engaged in cutting or blasting enemy barbed wire, should be considered as precursors of the Arditi. They were easily recognizable by their use of armor and &quot;Farina&quot; helmets.

In 1916 the supreme command decided to award special status to Arditi units but was reluctant to create new units. The Arditi badge, to be carried on the left arm, included the monogram VE (for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy), and was designed exclusively as a symbol of distinction for these soldiers. This was the first official use of the word &quot;Ardito&quot; by the Italian army.

In reality, all these units had no connection with the real Arditi that used extremely different tactics, training and equipment. In fact, on one hand, the scout units had the same tactics and equipment as the regular infantry, while on the other hand, the &quot;Compagnie della Morte&quot; filled a very different role, they were sappers and not shock troops and were quickly disbanded at the beginning of 1916.

The idea that would later lead to the birth of the Italian Assault Units dates back to the summer of 1916.

In fact, in that period Major General Francesco Grazioli, commander of the &quot;Lambro&quot; Infantry Brigade, wrote papers in which he explained his ideas on the creation of special elite infantry units that would allow the stalemate of trench warfare to be overcome.

Grazioli, who had observed the bloody attacks of the Italian infantry on the Carso in 1915, thought that these units should employ aggressive shock tactics, focusing in particular on identifying, mass attacking and breaking through the weakest points of the enemy lines, and then advancing in depth, encircling and destroying the strongest points of residence so as to cause the collapse of an entire front.

According to Grazioli these units, called &quot;Plotoni Speciali(&quot;Special Platoons), were to be made up of 36 men each and commanded by a junior officer. 27 soldiers, divided into three patrols of 9 men each, had to be trained in hand-to-hand combat, trench clearing and throwing of hand grenades, their equipment had to consist of a Carcano carbine, 5 SIPE hand grenades and a dagger. The rest of the men would form the Machine-Pistol section of the platoon equipped with two Villar Perosa Machine-Pistols each.

These platoons, created by Grazioli only in his brigade, were formed and trained in the months of June and July 1916 and would go into combat for the first time in August of the same year in the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo.

In fact, although it is not certain, it is probable that the special platoons played the role of spearhead in the attack of the &quot;Lambro&quot; Brigade against Monte Calvario on 6 and 7 August 1916.

In the following months the platoons continued to be part of the Brigade, mainly taking part in small-scale actions such as the counterattack east of Gorizia on 11 February 1917 in which the platoons drove the Austro-Hungarians from a position called Casa Due Pini which was lost following an enemy raid.

In the month of May the Tenth Battle of the Isonzo began and the special platoons, reorganized and enlarged, were employed on the hills east of Gorizia but without much success.

After the battle Grazioli was promoted and placed in command of the 48th Infantry Division and this allowed him to develop the idea of shock troops in greater depth and on a larger scale.

===Establishment ===
In fact, as commander of the 48th Infantry Division, Grazioli came into contact with a Major who had also theorized the establishment of shock units using special equipment and tactics. His name was Giuseppe Bassi and he was part of the 150th Infantry Regiment of the &quot;Trapani&quot; Brigade. 

Bassi, between October and November 1916, had written documents in which he theorized a reorganization and a very innovative use of the Machine-Pistol sections equipped with the Villar Perosa. He believed that the use of the Villar Perosa as light machine guns was a waste and suggested a series of modifications to improve the weapon: the removal of the heavy shield which limited mobility, the introduction of a very light bipod, the modification of the magazines to make the weapon easier and quicker to reload and the introduction of supports to allow the machine gunner to hold the weapon standing up without a crew and to fire it from the hips.

Thus modified, the Villar Perosa should have been used, according to Bassi, to lead attacks by using it as an assault weapon to clear the trenches and storm enemy positions, a role that suited it very well due to its rate of fire. 

But Bassi went further by imagining that the Villar Perosa should have been the base of new units of élite soldiers trained in the use of shock tactics and armed with equipment suitable for trench assaults. In his writings, in fact, Bassi explained that, by preceding the regular infantry in the offensives, small units armed with short rifles and hand grenades, accompanied by the violent fire of the Villar Perosa, could break the stalemate of trench warfare.

Bassi delivered these papers to his superior, General Gaetano Giardino, who in turn sent them to Francesco Saverio Grazioli knowing his interest in these ideas. The two met and combined their ideas and had among the readers of their documents the commander of the 2nd Italian Army, General Luigi Capello. Capello, an officer with a very offensive mindset and also looking for new methods to overcome trench warfare, showed himself very interested in the theories of Grazioli and Bassi. 

The two had the opportunity to put into practice what they had theorized in the summer of 1917, in fact on 26 June General Cadorna published a document in which he ordered the Army commanders to set up special shock units to use them in counterattacks, trench raids and as the spearhead in large-scale offensives, specifying to favor the Bersaglieri, troops with generally better physical preparation and training than regular infantrymen, but at the same time remaining rather vague and generic, allowing individual officers to make various changes.

Capello immediately ordered the commander of the XXIV Army Corps, General Caviglia, to proceed with the creation of a unit of this type of the size, for the moment, of a company. Caviglia created the assault company within General Fara&#x27;s 47th Infantry Division, forming it with troops from the Division&#x27;s Bersaglieri Regiments and based on the ideas of Grazioli and Bassi.
The company was ready in the first half of July and had 229 enlisted men and 37 COs and NCOs and had four platoons divided into four squads and was equipped with: four Machine-Pistol sections with two Villar Perosa each, one section per platoon, a Machine Gun section with two Fiat-Revelli Mod 1914 machine guns, a mortar section and a flamethrower section. The individual equipment of the Arditi consisted of a Carcano carbine, lighter and less cumbersome than the long rifle, a dagger and about a dozen hand grenades. Furthermore, to improve agility and mobility, the cyclist&#x27;s tunic with open collar was adopted, which would soon become the official uniform of the assault units.

Satisfied with the Bersaglieri Assault Company, Capello asked Cadorna for permission to create an assault unit with regular infantry soldiers and the Generalissimo granted it. So Capello ordered Grazioli to create two assault companies with recruits from the infantry units of his 48th Division. Grazioli, first of all, chose with Bassi a location near Udine called Sdricca di Manzano to create the training school of the Arditi and the HQ of the assault troops, there the recruits were then gathered and were joined by the Bersaglieri Company.

On July 29, 1917, in the presence of Cadorna and King Vittorio Emanuele III, the two new companies were created and together with the Bersaglieri Company they formed the first assault unit of the Italian Army which was called &quot;I Battaglione d&#x27;Assalto&quot; (1st Assault Battalion) officially marking the birth of the Arditi.

At the beginning of August the three companies continued training in the realistic and harsh Sdricca camp built by Bassi and in that period Capello wanted to introduce an element that became one of the major symbols of the Arditi: the flame-shaped collar tabs. The Arditi from the infantry wore the black flames while the Arditi Bersaglieri kept the crimson flames, already used by the units of the Bersaglieri corps, and, in the following months, the green flames were introduced for the Arditi coming from Alpine units. Furthermore Capello decided to create a third company of infantrymen constituted once again by the 48th Division, so the battalion had 4 companies that were renamed 1st, 2nd and 3rd Assault Companies while the Bersaglieri Company became 4th.

Training ended on 12 August, just when the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo was imminent.

===The Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo and its aftermath===

The Arditi had their baptism of fire in the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo. General Capello wanted his Arditi to operate on most of the front and therefore decided to divide the Assault Battalion and send the Companies to different locations. The 1st and 2nd Assault Companies were placed under the command of the XXVII Army Corps, the 3rd under that of Grazioli&#x27;s 48th Division and the 4th under that of General Fara&#x27;s 47th Division within the XXIV Army Corps.

On the afternoon of August 17, 1917, the Italian artillery unleashed a very violent bombardment on the Austro-Hungarian front from Tolmino to the sea and reached maximum intensity on the afternoon of August 18. Then, between 18 and 19 August, the infantry of the 2nd Army began to cross the Isonzo and invest the enemy defenses east of the river.

The 1st Company of Captain Maggiorino Radicati moved, on 18 August, from its barracks in Kambresko to Ronzina where it received orders: the Assault Company had the task of disembarking east of the Isonzo by boats and then attacking and conquering the town of Loga in order to create a first bridgehead and allow the passage of the &quot;Trapani&quot; Brigade.During the night the Arditi received the order to advance and, while the machine guns and mortars of the company targeted the east bank, the first Arditi began the crossing. In the early hours of 19 August the entire Company was on the other side and at dawn the attack on Loga began.Having easily conquered the front line trenches parallel to the river, Radicati&#x27;s Company pushed deep into the town and, leaving a platoon to mop up the buildings, clashed against a railway toll booth defended by numerically superior enemies who pushed back the Arditi. Despite this, Loga was secured and the &quot;Trapani&quot; Brigade had crossed the Isonzo so the Assault Company had done its duty. Remaining on the front line until the morning of August 20, the unit returned to Ronzina and from there by truck to Kambresko.

The 2nd Company operated just north of the 1st and was ordered to cross the Isonzo north of the town of Auzza, cross the Osvje valley and conquer Na Raunich, known as Height 511.When the Arditi, on the night of August 18, found themselves in front of the river they realized that the crossing was impossible due to enemy artillery and, under the command of Captain Italo Porcari, marched north to use the bridge built by the Alpini Battalion &quot;Belluno&quot; near the Doblar railway.

In the early hours of August 19, the 2nd Company ran across the bridge under fire and found itself on the other side with its entire force.The Arditi quickly attacked the front lines in the Osvje valley and captured several prisoners, a mortar, a 37mm gun and a 77mm gun. Without stopping, they broke into the rear where they surprised the enemy reinforcements that were preparing a counterattack, pushing them into the valley and forcing the survivors to surrender. The loot of the Arditi was added to three machine guns, a Machine-Pistol captured by the Austro-Hungarians and a second mortar.Resuming the advance, the Arditi together with the Alpini attacked and occupied height 511 and remained in line until 18:00. The following day they returned to Kambresko where they rejoined the 1st Company.

South of Loga, the 4th Company operated and was attached to the 21st Bersaglieri Regiment of the V Bersaglieri Brigade which, with the I Bersaglieri Brigade, formed the 47th Division. The Division was tasked with breaking through the first enemy defensive line on the Bainsizza, consisting of three fortified hills: Fratta, Semmer and height 856. The Company commanded by Captain Salvadori began the crossing at 11pm on August 18 and by midnight was completely on the other bank south of Loga. At dawn the Arditi attacked the first positions at the foot of the Fratta and subsequently took possession of height 300 from which they could attack the top of the hill. However, since they were isolated from the rest of the V Brigade and risked being surrounded, they retreated. The Brigade reorganized and the 4th Company was attached to the XXXVII Bersaglieri Battalion. The next day the Battalion attacked the Fratta with the Assault Company in the lead and managed to occupy the top of the hill. Arditi and Bersaglieri repelled various counterattacks until the 4th Company was also withdrawn to the western bank. In the meantime, the Semmer and height 856 were also occupied by the I Bersaglieri Brigade and the first Austro-Hungarian line was broken. 

More difficult was the debut of the 3rd Assault Company which was sent much further south near Gorizia under the command of the 48th Division. The Company, attached to the &quot;Lambro&quot; Brigade, had the task of occupying the positions of San Marco and Belpoggio but, although the Arditi managed to take Belpoggio, San Marco remained in enemy hands and the other Italian units were also pushed back. Since the attack had been suspended there was no longer any reason to keep the Arditi at the front and so the 3rd Company was also brought back to the rear.

After the clashes on Bainsizza and on the hills east of Gorizia, the four companies gathered at Sdricca to prepare the action that Capello had in mind. In fact, after the breakthrough of the Austro-Hungarian lines on Bainsizza, the Italian army crashed against Mount San Gabriele. This mountain occupied a strategic position in the center of the Isonzo valley, east of Salcano, and its conquest would have opened the way to the Tarnova plateau and the Vipacco valley as well as to the bypass of the line of hills that rose east of Gorizia. The Austrians, aware of this, heavily fortified the already impervious and wooded mountain. The first attack was launched on August 31 by troops of the &quot;Arno&quot; Brigade who briefly occupied the peak before being repelled by a counterattack. Capello immediately decided to use the 2nd, 3rd and 4th companies under the command of Maggiorino Radicati, who in the meantime had been placed in charge of the entire I Battalion.

The Arditi arrived in the 11th Division sector on 1 September and the attack was scheduled for 4 September. The 2nd Company had orders to attack the first lines on the slopes of San Gabriele and then occupy the summit and the eastern slope, the 4th was tasked with attacking the Santa Caterina spur on the right flank and the 3rd was ordered to attack the Dol saddle on the left flank.

At 5am on 4 September the Italian artillery opened a very destructive fire on San Gabriele and the area around, 15 minutes later the Arditi began to cross no man&#x27;s land. At 5:30am the bombardment ceased and the attack began. The 2nd Company broke through the lines on the slopes and attacked the summit, with the Austro-Hungarians also unaware of the assault, clearing it with hand grenades and flamethrowers at 6:30 am and then descending onto the eastern slopes. The 4th Company took Santa Caterina and the positions behind it, linking up with the 2nd on the eastern slopes. The 3rd Company, however, took the blockhouse on the Dol saddle but failed to occupy the rear heights 526 and 367. From Sabotino, Cadorna, Capello and King Vittorio Emanuele watched Lieutenant Salvatore Farina plant the tricolour on San Gabriele using a captured rifle as a spear. 3127 prisoners, 55 machine guns and 26 trench guns had been captured and Initially the Arditi seemed unstoppable, so much so that they began to advance towards Mount San Daniele east of San Gabriele, but the intervention of enemy artillery stopped them. Waves of Austro-Hungarians repeatedly attacked the Arditi who pushed them back at the cost of heavy losses. The &quot;Arno&quot; Brigade sent infantry battalions as reinforcements but did not make it in time and the Arditi decided to abandon the eastern slopes of the mountain to retreat to the summit due to the lack of reinforcements and supplies. The Arditi defended the summit until 19:00 but, short of supplies and reinforcements and with many officers killed, they spontaneously retreated. In the following days the mountain changed occupant several times following attacks and counterattacks from both sides until on 10 September the Italians gave up and left San Gabriele in enemy hands.

While the fighting was still going on on the Bainsizza, the first assault unit of the 3rd Army also had its baptism of fire. The unit had been created in July within the 11th Regiment of the II Bersaglieri Brigade and was made up of three companies with about 200 men each (of which the third was not yet ready) equipped, in addition to carbines and hand grenades, with 20 Machine-Pistols and 4 flamethrower sections, while HMGs were still missing and officers were scarce.

At the beginning of the battle, the Arditi were attached to the &quot;Murge&quot; Infantry Brigade, which formed the 28th Division with the II Bersaglieri Brigade, and were held in reserve. On August 20, the Bersaglieri Brigade was withdrawn and the &quot;Murge&quot; Brigade and the Arditi went into action.

The task was to advance in succession on Heights 145, 175, 199, 279 and 280 along the Flondar-Medeazza line. After the artillery barrage, the Arditi, followed by the battalions of the &quot;Murge&quot; Brigade, went over the top at 8am against Height 145 which was taken at 09:45am. The Italians continued towards Height 175 but, due to the lack of officers and cohesion, the assault unit disintegrated and the companies fought separately and isolated. The Austro-Hungarian artillery and machine guns blocked the attack and at 11:15am the Italians lost Height 145 which was then retaken and lost twice and then captured and held in a third assault at the end of the day. On 21 August the &quot;Murge&quot; Brigade and the Arditi attacked and took Height 175 which was however lost due to a counterattack that was pushed up to Height 145. The Italians then retook both heights at 12:50am but at 4pm they lost Height 175 again. The &quot;Murge&quot; Brigade was ordered to retake the height at all costs and a final attack, started at 6pm, allowed them to retake it and hold it until the morning of 22 August, repelling all counterattacks. On that morning the two Assault Companies were withdrawn due to heavy losses and the officers of the 3rd Army, due to lack of organization and cohesion, disbanded the entire assault unit of the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment.
Despite the failure to conquer San Gabriele, the Assault Battalion of the 2nd Army made a positive impression on the Supreme Command, which on September 21, 1917 published a document that described more precisely and less vaguely the uniform, organization and armament to be adopted for the assault units, virtually imposing the model of the 2nd Army on all the others. The only point of disagreement between Capello and the Command was the imposition of only three companies for Assault Battalion, while Capello supported the need for a fourth.

Thus in September the Italian Armies dedicated themselves to the creation of the Assault Battalions. The 1st Army raised the battalions IV, XVI, IX, XXIII and XXIV, the 4th Army raised the battalions VI, V, VIII and VII, the III Army Corps raised the XVII Assault Battalion, the Carnia Zone Command raised the XVIII Battalion, the 3rd Army, learning from the failure of its first assault unit, raised the battalions XIX, XX, XXI and XXII and, finally, the 2nd Army raised another five battalions called II, III, IV, V and VI.

In the months of September and October the Assault Battalions concentrated on training, only the II Assault Battalion of the 2nd Army had its baptism of fire. In fact, on September 29, the Battalion, attached to the &quot;Venezia&quot; Infantry Brigade, took part in the attack on Height 800, a dominant position on the Vallone di Chiapovano, in turn a vital communication route between the Isonzo valley and the Tarnova plateau. At 6:30 am the artillery of the 44th Division opened a very violent fire on the height that was shelled until 8 am. The Arditi, followed by the infantry, came out of the trenches a few minutes before the end of the barrage and at 8:20 am Height 800 was taken. The Arditi, having descended on the eastern slope, attacked and occupied the enemy rear where they crushed an attempted counterattack by the enemy, annihilating their reserves. At the end of the battle, the Italians had captured 15 Machine Guns and 1,039 enemies, including 47 officers. Once the attack was concluded, the II Assault Battalion returned to Sdricca.

===The Retreat of Caporetto===

The German breakthrough at Caporettoon 24 October 1917 caught the Arditi gathered in their training camps and, due to the emergency, they were employed together with the Bersaglieri, Cyclists and Cavalry as rearguard troops to protect the retreat.

The first assault unit to face the enemy advance was the IV Assault Battalion of the 1st Army which fought first at Luico, then at Savogna and Castel del Monte against the 12th Silesian Division between 24 and 25 October and, after suffering heavy losses, was attached to the IV Bersaglieri Brigade with which it retreated first to the Tagliamento and on 9 November to the Piave. From there it was sent to the Asiago Plateau to reorganize.

The Assault Battalions V and VI of the 4th Army covered the retreat from Cadore to Monte Grappa and sustained heavy fighting at Sappada and Quero. The nearby Carnia Zone Command also used its XVIII Battalion as a rearguard at Navarons and Forcella Clautana until it reached the new line and was disbanded.

Within the 3rd Army, only the XIX Battalion retreated without taking part in the rearguard actions sustained by the XX, XXI and XXII Battalions on the Livenza. Once the passage west of the Piave was completed, the XIX, XX and XXI Battalions were left at the front until December while the XXII was taken to the rear due to heavy losses.

The six Assault Battalions of the 2nd Army were grouped under the command of Colonel Bassi and after the breakthrough they retreated on trucks first towards Cividale and then Udine, Cadorna HQ. There the I Battalion and units of the II sustained some fighting on the Torre torrent against the Germans who were coming from Beivars. On October 28 the I Battalion, while the other five were retreating, suffered, together with some units of Alpini and Bersaglieri, the attack of a numerically superior German force. To gain time and allow Italian soldiers and civilians to evacuate Udine, the Arditi launched bloody counterattacks and slowed down the enemy, then, due to the losses suffered, the Battalion retreated to Udine now deserted where they realized that the city was totally surrounded by Germans. The Arditi retreated to the Castle of Udine where they had their last stand in which they impressed the enemy by refusing to surrender several times and fighting until the last ammo. In the end the I Battalion was annihilated, about 360 Arditi died and only 70 were taken prisoner, including the commander of the Battalion Maggiorino Radicati. Only the 1st Company of the I Battalion escaped encirclement and managed to rejoin Bassi&#x27;s Battalions, which were now among the few units of the 2nd Army that had not disintegrated. The Arditi subsequently engaged in the defense of Pinzano, a vital crossing point on the Tagliamento, but the crossing of the river at Ragogna by the Germans forced the Italians to retreat again from the Tagliamento to the Piave. Having reunited the Assault Battalions at Pieve di Soligo, Bassi managed to supply them with weapons and ammunition and let them rest for a few hours, but the Arditi quickly returned to battle. In fact, the Supreme Command ordered Bassi&#x27;s Battalions to resist as long as possible on the hills between Conegliano and Vittorio Veneto to allow the 3rd Army and the remnants of the 2nd to complete the crossing of the Piave. The Arditi slowed down the enemies and gradually retreated towards Vidor, the last Italian bridgehead east of the Piave and the only town to still have an intact bridge over the river.

Vidor was defended from 6 to 10 November by the II Bersaglieri Brigade, Bassi&#x27;s Arditi and two companies of Alpini who repelled all the assaults of the 12th Silesian Division. On 10 November these units were also allowed to cross the Vidor bridge which was about to be blown up and the IV Assault Battalion of the 2nd Army was the last Italian unit to leave the eastern bank of the Piave.
===The First Battle of the Piave and the reorganization===

The retreat from Caporetto was particularly hard for the Arditi who, employed as a rearguard, suffered heavy losses and therefore most of the units were kept in the rear while only a few took part in the battle of arrest in November-December 1917.

On the Asiago Plateau, where the 11th Austro-Hungarian Army was pressing, three of the four Assault Battalions of the 1st Italian Army threw themselves into the fray. On 10 November, to avoid a greater penetration, the XVI counterattacked the enemy at Gallio, liberating the town after heavy urban combat. The IX Battalion counterattacked at Monte Fior on 18 November and the XXIV took part in the clashes at Monte Melago, defeating the Austro-Hungarians. The three Battalions were then taken to the plains in the rear after Christmas.On the Grappa, the XVIII Battalion of the Carnia Zone, the V of the 4th Army and the III of the 2nd Army took part in the fighting and on 19 November counterattacked the Germans on Monfenera where a dangerous salient was eliminated.On the Piave, in the 3rd Army sector, the XXI and XXII Assault Battalions participated, together with various infantry units, in the counterattack that crushed a dangerous bridgehead created around the town of Zenson by several Austro-Hungarian units that had crossed the river.

While the First Battle of the Piave ended with the Italian defensive victory, the new Chief of Staff, Armando Diaz, began the reorganization of the Army.

The Arditi were initially subject to the dissolution of some units, mainly due to the losses suffered. The IX Assault Battalion of the 1st Army was disbanded, in addition to losses, also for serious acts of indiscipline committed in November and its still able men were integrated into the XVI Assault Battalion while the others were expelled from the Arditi Corp. The XVIII Battalion of the Carnia Zone and the V of the 4th Army were also disbanded for losses and their men integrated into the VI Assault Battalion. The Assault Battalions of the 3rd Army all remained operational. Bassi&#x27;s Battalions of the former 2nd Army were reunited in Cartigliano, near Vicenza, and, starting from Caporetto with 5000 men, had arrived on the Piave with about 2000 divided into six thinned-out units. The Supreme Command decided to disband Battalions III, IV, V and VI and integrate their men into I and II, which were attached to the XX and XXII Corps of the 1st Army respectively, so as to have two Assault Battalions with three complete Companies.

Subsequently there were no major changes in armament, training and organization because Diaz considered the Arditi an already complete and perfected armed branch and preferred to improve and strengthen the regular infantry but he was still determined to reduce, at least in part, the autonomy of the Arditi by ordering to attach only one Assault Battalion to each Army Corps and expressly forbidding that a single officer command multiple Assault Battalions. Because of these orders, Colonel Giuseppe Bassi left the command of the Assault Battalions, greeted with emotion by his Arditi, and was placed in charge of the 76th Infantry Regiment of the &quot;Napoli&quot; Brigade. This dissatisfied some of the early Arditi, first and foremost Salvatore Farina and Paolo Giudici, two lieutenants who, in their post-war books, wrote how, in their opinion, the 1918 reorganization had partly distorted the Arditi.

However, in the first weeks of 1918, most of the assault units were back in excellent condition and the Army Corps that were still without an Assault Battalion provided for the creation of new Arditi units, also reviving disbanded units such as the III Battalion, recreated within the V Corps of the 1st Army, and the V Battalion, within the XXVII Corps.At the same time, the Supreme Command resumed operations on a local scale along the entire front, resuming an aggressive attitude and also involving the Arditi greatly

===The Battle of the Three Mountains===

By early 1918, the Italian Army had fully recovered from the disaster of Caporetto and the new year began with a victory that marked the newfound offensive capacity of the Italians.

In fact, in January the so-called &quot;Battle of the Three Mountains&quot; was fought on the Asiago plateau. In December 1917, the Austro-Hungarians conquered the three peaks, adjacent to each other, of Col del Rosso, Col d&#x27;Echele and Monte Valbella. The Three Mountains line guaranteed the Austro-Hungarians an excellent control point over the Val Frenzela and constituted a possible starting point for a direct attack on the valley, furthermore the Italians found themselves on the edge of the plateau, almost pushed out.To give greater solidity to the defenses and to take away a tactically and strategically important position from the enemies, the Italian command organized an attack on the Three Mountains line. To conduct it, the most combative units of the Army were called upon, such as the Infantry Brigades &quot;Sassari&quot;, &quot;Bisagno&quot;, the 4th Bersaglieri Brigade and the Assault Battalions I, II and IV. The attack relied on a destructive but short bombardment and on a rapid and sudden advance of the assault troops against the flanks of the hills and avoiding the center, while the regular infantry was supposed to advance later to mop up the last pockets of enemy resistance and entrench the positions just occupied.

After hours of bombardment, the attack began at 9 am on January 28. The Arditi of the I Assault Battalion, followed by the infantry of the Sassari, attacked Col del Rosso and Col d&#x27;Echele which fell only in the afternoon and for the rest of the day repelled all Austro-Hungarian counterattacks. Monte Valbella was attacked by the II Assault Battalion followed by the Bersaglieri of the IV Brigade but the position resisted and the attack was stopped. On 29 January the Austrians attempted, but failed, to retake the two lost hills while the Italians renewed the attack against Monte Valbella this time with reinforcements from the IV Assault Battalion. Valbella also fell and the Austrians counterattacked along the entire line. The fighting lasted until 30 January but the Italians remained on the three hills and the Austrians retreated. This victory, in addition to ensuring a militarily important success, greatly improved the military morale of the Italians as this was the first offensive victory after Caporetto.

===Spring 1918===

In early spring, the Italian command expected a major Austro-Hungarian offensive along the entire front and General Diaz ordered the Arditi to intensify raids and incursions behind enemy lines to capture prisoners, damage enemy positions and above all obtain information on the next offensive.

In April and May, the VIII Assault Battalion carried out several raids against Ca Tasson on Monte Grappa and was involved in a large-scale assault against heights 1443 and 1503. Also on Grappa, the X Assault Battalion carried out some raids in the Monfenera sector.

In May, on the Piave, the Arditi of the XIX Assault Battalion broke through to a depth of 750 meters into enemy lines in the Capo Sile area.

In the same month, the III Assault Battalion conquered, in one of the most daring and famous actions of the war, Mount Corno di Vallarsa (where Cesare Battisti had been captured two years earlier) which granted a gold medal to the Company Commander Carlo Sabatini. The Assault Units of the 10th Army also engaged in similar actions on the Stelvio.

On May 25, on Adamello, the III Assault Battalion (previously called XVII), together with various Alpine Battalions, played a leading role in the conquest of &quot;Cima Presena&quot;.

Later, between May and June the Arditi corpwas reorganized. First of all, to simplify logistics and communications, each Assault Battalion was ordered to assume the numeral of its Army Corps and so, on May 20: 

-The I Battalion (1st Army) became XX

-The II Battalion (1st Army) became XXII

-The III Battalion (1st Army) became V

-The IV Battalion (1st Army) became XXVI

-The V Battalion (8th Army) became XXVII

-The VI Battalion (4th Army) became IX

-The VII Battalion (4th Army) became XXX

-The VIII Battalion (4th Army) became VI

-The IX Battalion (4th Army) became XVIII

-The X Battalion (4th Army) became I

-The XI Battalion (5th Army) became XII

-The XII Battalion (5th Army) became XIV

-The XIII Battalion (5th Army) became II

-The XIV (52nd Division of the 6th Army) became LII

-The XVI Battalion (6th Army) became XXV

-The XVII Battalion (7th Army) became III

-The XVIII (3rd Army) became XXVIII

-The XIX (3rd Army) became XXIII

-The XX (3rd Army) became XI

-The XXI (3rd Army) became XIII

-The XXII (3rd Army) became VIII

-The XXIII (1st Army) became XXIX

-The XXIV (1st Army) became X

-The XXV (XVI Army Corps) became XVI

-The XXVI (35th Division) became XXXV

Subsequently the order of battle of the assault battalions changed completely. In fact at the beginning of June General Grazioli (one of the founders of the Arditi) suggested creating large units of dimensions comparable to the army corps on the model of the Arditi battalions so that they could perfectly combine firepower, shock and maneuverability and be able to achieve a strategic breakthrough also counting on the collaboration of these units with the air forces and tanks that Grazioli wanted to buy from the French and integrate into the units he had in mind.

This project fascinated the commands who decided to make it happen with some modifications.On June 10 a single division was officially created, provisionally, which was called &quot;Divisione Speciale A&quot; .(Special Division &quot;A&quot;) The Division was structured into three assault groups, each of which was under the command of a colonel and consisted of three battalions. The division&#x27;s units were also equipped with mountain artillery groups that were light enough to give the division the mobility needed for maneuver, for the fire of heavier guns it would have to rely on the artillery of regular infantry units.To improve maneuverability, armored car units were also added that would replace the Renault FT tanks that the French ultimately did not sell. The new division&#x27;s strengths were the greater number of automatic weapons compared to the regular infantry, superior training and, above all, cooperation with the armored and air units with which they trained.

However, the creation of Division A, which required nine battalions, left several Army Corps without assault units and to compensate the creation of new Arditi battalions was ordered.

It was under these conditions that the Arditi faced the Battle of the Solstice.

===The Second Battle of the Piave===

In the Second Battle of the Piave River almost all the Assault Battalions, with the exception of the III which was in reserve, had the opportunity to fight.

On the Asiago Plateau the Austro-Hungarian advance, which had been deeper and more dangerous in the sector garrisoned by British troops, was contained and pushed back in the space of a single day. Here the LII Assault Battalion had the opportunity to distinguish itself by reconquering the lost position of Costalunga.

On Grappa the situation was more serious: attacking in the sector of the Italian IX Corps, the Austro-Hungarians broke through all three Italian lines (Col Fagheron, Col Fenilon and Col Moschin). The breakthrough put the entire defense of Grappa in serious danger and, to avoid its fall and the subsequent flanking of the troops on the Piave, a counterattack was chosen. The IX Assault Battalion commanded by Major Giovanni Messe was therefore sent to the front line. Towards evening the artillery of the X Corps opened fire on the Austro-Hungarian lines. At 9pm the Arditi launched the attack and covered their movements with the various woods present there. The first position to fall was Col Fagheron followed by Col Fenilon, both conquered in a short time and which resulted in the Arditi capturing prisoners and machine guns. Immediately the infantrymen of the &quot;Basilicata&quot; Brigade took possession of the conquered positions and allowed the Arditi to retreat and organize the last attack towards Col Moschin. After another bombardment, the 9th Battalion attacked the hill in the early hours of 16 June. In just 20 minutes (10 of climbing and 10 of fighting), the Austrian defenses were totally overwhelmed and the Arditi took control of Col Moschin and in addition to various machine guns, 250 prisoners were also taken, carrying out the most famous action of the Arditi which still today it gives its name to the Italian special forces. In the other sectors of Grappa the Assault Battalions XVIII and VI counterattacked the Austro-Hungarians victoriously on Mount Asolone and Mount Pertica respectively. On 16 June the Austro-Hungarian offensive ended in failure on Grappa too.

However, the most powerful attack launched by the Austro-Hungarians was on the Piave. Already on the morning of 15 June the Austro-Hungarians crossed the river, broke through the Italian lines in some places and established bridgeheads on the west bank. Most of the fighting occurred on Montello, a hill in the center of the front, which was conquered by the Austro-Hungarians up to the town of Nervesa. Immediately the Assault Battalions of the Italian armies began counterattacks to block the Austro-Hungarian advance. On Montello, the XXVII Battalion, which had been operating on the Piave since April, launched a counterattack around the town of Giavera, partially recapturing part of the lost ground and remaining to contain the Austro-Hungarians until 19 June. The XXVI Assault Battalion also fought on Montello where, counterattacking in front of Nervesa, it contributed to blocking the enemy attack. In the sector of the 3rd Army, where the Austro-Hungarians created dangerous bridgeheads at San Donà and Fossalta di Piave, the Arditi of the Army of the Duke of Aosta went into action: the XI Battalion fought between Villanova and Fagarè, the XVIII intervened at Zenson and Villa Premuda, the XXIII fought for several days at Capo Sile and the XXV (ceded to the 3rd Army by the 1st) engaged the enemy at San Pietro Novello. 

In the meantime, it was planned to use Special Division A to counterattack the bridgehead at Fossalta di Piave, between Montello and San Donà so that the three bridgeheads would not connect. The Division was brought into line but the attack, planned for 17 June, did not begin due to an unexpected Austro-Hungarian attack which was promptly blocked. The following day the Division attacked at 4pm with Fossalta di Piave, Osteria di Fossalta and Capo d&#x27;Argine as objectives. Since the Arditi were not used to operating as a Division, the various Battalions were unable to coordinate adequately and the attack was disorganised. Since the Arditi were not used to operating as a Division, the various Battalions were unable to coordinate adequately and the attack was disorganized: despite their usual valor and efficiency the Arditi managed to conquer only part of their objectives and since many battalions were left with their flanks exposed, they finally withdrew. Major General Ottavio Zoppi, commander of the Assault Division, did not give up and proposed to the commander of the 33rd Infantry Division to cooperate in a counterattack. On 19 June the &quot;Sassari&quot; Infantry Brigade launched its attack against the bridgehead with a part of the Arditi of the Division as the spearhead and this time the Italians reached and maintained all their objectives. On 20 June the Austro-Hungarians had not achieved any notable objectives and it was decided to conclude the offensive and begin retreat operations on the eastern bank of the Piave. The retreat ended on 24 June and marked the decisive Italian victory of the war.

===Last months of war===

Despite the substantial failure of the counterattack on 17 June, the Italian commands decided to set up a second Arditi Division and to do so it was decided to modify the organization of the already existing one. Instead of having three Groups with three battalions each it was decided to remove the third assault battalion from each group and replace it with a battalion of Bersaglieri, in order to have a source of reinforcements to support the attack. Once the organization of Division A was modified (which was renamed the 1st Assault Division), another Division was created on the same model and was called the 2nd Assault Division, placed under the command of Major General De Marchi. The two Divisions were reunited in the so-called Assault Army Corps whose commander became General Francesco Saverio Grazioli, one of the fathers of the Arditi. The new Army Corps spent the whole summer training in both shock and maneuver, concentrating in particular on breaking through heavily fortified lines and on the pursuit, encirclement and annihilation of retreating enemies and also training in cooperation with aviation and armored car units.

While the Assault Army Corps trained, the other Arditi Units engaged in small-scale operations to damage enemy positions, capture weapons and prisoners and above all to obtain information on enemy defenses east of the Piave.

The Grappa Assault Battalions, such as the IX and XVIII, launched various attacks on the most important peaks of Grappa, such as the Asolone,

The III Assault Battalion carried out some raids on the sector of the 7th Army, on 24 June the XXIX Assault Battalion attacked and conquered Dosso Alto di Zures in Val Lagarina and XXVII Assault Battalion began various reconnaissances beyond the Piave, including a massive raid on Fontigo on 2 July.

The main operation of the summer, however, was that carried out by the 3rd Army which launched a local offensive in the Lower Piave area to regain the last strips of land remaining in enemy hands west of the river.The attack was spearheaded mainly by the XXVIII Assault Battalion, accompanied by a provisional battalion made up of companies of the XI and XXIII, and despite initial Austro-Hungarian resistance the Italians were victorious.

In September the operations continued and two battalions of the 2nd Assault Division (I and VI) were also temporarily detached and transferred to Grappa:In particular, the VI attacked altitude 1443 and the I launched a raid on the position of Casa Forzellette. On September 14 the LXX Assault Battalion attacked and occupied Grottelle in Val Brenta, the XXIX carried out a raid near Sanio and the XXV stormed enemy trenches on the Pertica.

In October, given the imminence of the final offensive, the XXVII Assault Battalion continued its reconnaissance beyond the Piave while on the Grappa the IX Battalion took the Col del Cuc and I Battalion raided austo-hungarian positions in the Ornic Valley. 

Thanks to all these operations it was possible to outline the consistency of the enemy defenses beyond the Piave.

===The Battle of Vittorio Veneto===

On 24 October 1918 the final attack that would lead to Italy&#x27;s victory and the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire began and the Arditi of the Assault Army Corps would play a fundamental role.

In fact, according to the plans of the Supreme Command, General Caviglia&#x27;s 8th Army should have launched a single concentrated assault in the center of the Piave, with the objective of breaking through the enemy lines and conquering the city of Vittorio Veneto, which due to its position would have allowed to separate and isolate the Austro-Hungarian armies that occupied the Veneto.

The Assault Army Corps was supposed to play the role of spearhead of the 8th Army, constituting the first bridgeheads beyond the Piave. In particular, the two Assault Divisions would have been attached to the two front-line army corps of the 8th Army, the XXII and the VIII.

However, when the battle began on 24 October, the Piave was in flood and the crossing operations did not begin. 

Only on Monte Grappa, where the Italians planned to launch a diversionary attack, was it possible to take action.

The Grappa Assault Battalions, the IX, XVIII, III and XXIII, were all on the front line when at 7.15am, after 5 hours of violent bombing, the Italians began the assault.

The attacks involved the Solaroli, Monte Pertica and above all the Asolone but due to the powerful Austrian defenses the Italian advance was slow and bloody.

Two days later, on 26 October, while the offensive on Grappa cost the Italians many losses, the waters of the Piave calmed down and the Assault Army Corps wanted to begin crossing operations. During the night the Assault Groups of the 1st Division began to land on the other bank in front of them and found themselves with the three defensive lines that they had to break through to create a bridgehead: the first line, poorly defended, called the &quot;Linea di dei Mulini &quot;, the second, more fortified and made up of a series of destroyed and fortified towns (Moriago, Fontigo, Sernaglia, Falzè and others) called &quot;line of towns&quot; and finally a third line made up of hills that delimited the Piave plain from the east. In the hours between 26 and 27 October the Arditi of the 1st Assault Division attacked and managed to break through the first and second lines. In the following hours, however, after some enemy counterattacks, the Arditi realized that their communication lines were too fragile and therefore Ottavio Zoppi decided to move back the occupied territory by a few kilometers to better defend themselves. On 27 October the Austrians counterattacked both on the Grappa and on the Piave but the Italians resisted. In the following days the Italians continued to advance on the Grappa and the Piave. In particular, the Italian XI Army Corps together with the British troops, with the XI Assault Battalion in the lead, occupied the Grave di Papadopoli and crossed the Piave en masse, threatening the southern flank of the Austrian defenses. The 1st Assault Division took advantage of this and continued the attack against the third line, which fell after furious fighting on 28 and 29 October. On 30 October it was clear to the Austro-Hungarian commands that the Italians, once the last defenses had been overwhelmed, were uncontainable and a general retreat was therefore ordered, also deciding to send an officer to negotiate the armistice.

On 28 October, the 2nd Assault Division, which until then had remained on the western bank of the Piave, also crossed the river and immediately began to harass the retreating enemy, pursuing him up to the Piave Valley and breaking through every provisional defense created by the Austro-Hungarians to slow them down. When the armistice came into force on 4 November, the Division had arrived in Pieve di Cadore.

In the meantime the Italian advance had become general. On 30 October the 3rd Army crossed the Piave and overwhelmed the last Austrian defenses near Grisolera and Romanziol thanks to the intervention of the XXVI and XXVIII Assault Battalions which were always at the head of the Army during the advance and concluded their war on the bank east of the Tagliamento.

The 4th Army finally managed to overwhelm the defenses of Grappa and route the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army, liberating Feltre and Belluno.

On the same day the 7th, 1st and 6th Armies also began to advance and poured into Trentino with their Assault Battalions on the front line, such as the XXIX and LII, which served to make the first breaches in the enemy lines and routing the Austro-Hungarians.

This marked the end of the last battle of the Italian Front in which the Arditi played a decisive role.
===Assault Battalions abroad===

Four Assault Battalions served outside Italy in other theaters of the First World War where the Italian Army operated.

The II Assault Battalion (originally called XIII) was sent to France in April 1918, attached to the II Italian Army Corps. There it distinguished itself as a counterattack unit during the Second Battle of the Marne in the Reims sector. After the battle Alberico Albricci, commander of the Italian troops in France, ordered the creation of another Assault Battalion, called XXXII, which was involved in the breakthrough of the German lines on the Chemins des Dames in October 1918.

In Albania the XVI Battalion (formerly called XXV) operated and was mainly employed in raids against pro-Austrian Albanian militias and also participated in the great Franco-Italian offensive in Albania in July 1918. It remained there even after the war where it fought against Albanian insurgents who opposed the Italian military presence.

In Macedonia the XXXV Assault Battalion was formed as part of the 35th Italian Infantry Division. There the Arditi carried out several raids against Germans and Bulgarians and also fought in the Vardar Offensive. After the war the Battalion was among the Allied occupation troops in Istanbul.

==Training==
Initially the soldiers were volunteers, but later on unit commanders designated suitable soldiers for transfer to Arditi units. In the document of June 1917 the Supreme Command suggested preferring the Bersaglieri due to their greater physical prowess but in a short time the Arditi ended up being drawn en masse from the regular infantry even more than the Bersaglieri. Alpini, despite the existence of some Alpine Assault Battalions, were drawn in smaller numbers into the Arditi mainly due to their extreme esprit de corps which led them to be extremely fond of their Alpine unit.. After undergoing tests of strength, skill and nerve, the recruits were trained in the use of weapons and innovative tactics of attack. They also received hand-to-hand fighting instruction with or without weapons (according to the &quot;Flower of Battle&quot; techniques developed in the Middle Ages), all supported by continuous physical training.

In particular, Arditi were trained with hand grenades, marksmanship and the use of the flamethrower and machine gun, including captured enemy equipment. Training was very realistic, and several men were killed during basic training: in particular, casualties were caused by splinters from hand grenades, because their operating procedure provided for a direct assault immediately after throwing a grenade. The rigorous training, team spirit and contempt of danger, but also the privileges they enjoyed, made the Arditi an elite corps, but also created a climate of distrust and jealousy with officers belonging to other units of the regular army. Their military skill, however, earned them respect for the ability to resolve on the battlefield situations tactically impossible for regular army units.
Reginaldo Giuliani, a Catholic priest and an Ardito, wrote several books on his experiences, including &quot;Croce e spada&quot; (&#x27;Cross and Sword&#x27;).
==Uniform==
The Arditi of the Reparto d’assalto were issued distinctive uniforms that identified them as an elite unit.  

The Arditi uniform was based on that of the &quot;Bersaglieri Ciclisti&quot; (Italian cyclist troops). The tunic was the same as that of the &quot;Bersaglieri Ciclisti.&quot;  It had shoulder straps, two belt loops and a large game pocket used for carrying hand grenades and other items. Unlike other Italian uniforms of the time, the Arditi uniform was worn with an open collar in order to facilitate movement. Arditi units made up from former infantry soldiers wore black flame collar patches with the standard Italian five pointed star.  Arditi drawn from Alpini units would instead wear green flames on their lapels while Arditi drawn from Bersaglieri units would wear crimson flames.  The Reparto d’assato patch was worn on the left sleeve.  A gray-green sweater, also used by the &quot;Bersaglieri Ciclisti&quot;, was worn under the tunic.  The sweater was replaced by a grey-green shirt and a black tie in 1918. The trousers were those of the Bersaglieri bicycle units or the Aplini units which were usually worn with woolen socks. Alpini boots were chosen over the heavier standard infantry boots.  Headware varied considerably.  In 1917, Arditi wore the standard infantry “scodolino” cap.  This cap was replaced with a black fez with a tassle, similar to the crimson fezs worn by the Bersaglieri.  Arditi drawn from the Alpini, retained their distinctive Alpini cap. The standard Italian Adrian helmet was, of course, worn in combat and was decorated with the numeral of the Assault Battalion in Roman numerals .

Many of the Arditi badges and symbols were later adopted by the fascist regime, for example a badge depicting a skull with a dagger clenched between the teeth. The anti-fascist Arditi del Popolo also had their own badge (skull with red eyes and dagger). Their battle cry was &quot;A Noi!&quot; (&#x27;To Us!&#x27;), which was later adopted as one of the phrases commonly used when making the Roman salute and originated as a duelling challenge during the Renaissance.

==Equipment==

Typical equipment of the Arditi was the dagger for hand-to-hand combat, and hand grenades. The grenades were used to create panic and confusion as well as for their disruptive effect. The Thevenot hand grenade frequently used by the Arditi was well suited for assaults, not being overly powerful, but very noisy so as to provoke fear in the opponents. Other weapons included Fiat Revelli Mod. 1914 machine guns and flame throwers. The carbines used by the Arditi were the Carcano &quot;Moschetto 91&quot; and &quot;Moschetto 91 TS&quot;. The Arditi also used 37 mm and 65 mm cannons against pillboxes and fortifications.

Furthermore, one of the most important weapons of the Arditi was the FIAT Machine-Pistol Model 1915. This fully automatic double-barreled weapon chambered for the 9mm Glisenti was initially used, with poor results, as a normal machine gun but, thanks to Bassi&#x27;s intuitions, it was understood how to best exploit the VP which quickly became an integral part of the Arditi&#x27;s shock tactics.

Used on the move without a crew and carried by a trained Ardito called &quot;pistolettiere&quot;, the Villar Perosa led the assaults accompanying the rest of the unit with its high rate of fire and contributing greatly in clearing the trenches.The Italian military, preceding the German MP18 by a year, had already begun to outline the concept of &quot;SMG&quot; in 1917.

The Villar Perosa, as decided by the Command with the document of 21 September 1917, was distributed to the Arditi in six sections per Battalion (two per company) of four Machine-Pistols each.

In the &quot;Museo del Risorgimento&quot; in Turin, the hall is dedicated to the resistance against Fascism. There are on display a dagger and a hand grenade belonging to the Arditi del Popolo. Due to lack of resources the daggers were manufactured from surplus stock of the bayonets from the Vetterli rifle. 

==Under fascism==

In the post-World War I period, many Arditi joined the &#x27;National Association Arditi d&#x27;Italia&#x27; (ANAI), founded by captain Mario Carli, then involved in the Futurist movement in art. Carli wrote the essay &quot;Arditi are not gendarmes&quot; in collaboration with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.

A large number of Arditi joined the fascist movement, but support was not unanimous, as is clear from the &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot;, a fringe breakaway movement of the ANAI, politically leaning to the maximalist wing of non-fascist socialism. In any case, most Arditi who joined the ANAI transferred their allegiance to the FNAI (National Federation Arditi D&#x27;Italia), founded on 23 October 1922 by Mussolini. The ANAI was later dissolved.

The Arditi were active participants in Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s coup in the city of Fiume (now Rijeka, in Croatia). When his original plan for Italian annexation was rebuffed by the government in Rome, D&#x27;Annunzio proclaimed the founding of the &quot;Italian Regency of Carnaro&quot;. With the trade unionist De Ambris, D&#x27;Annunzio promulgated a constitution, the Charter of Carnaro, containing strongly progressive or even radical elements. On 25 December 1920 regular Italian army troops put an end to the short-lived &quot;regency&quot;, after brief clashes.

==The Arditi del Popolo==
The Roman section of the Italian Arditi, in contrast to the strong but not yet consolidated movement of fascist &quot;squadrismo&quot;, became the &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot;, a paramilitary group that was clearly anti-fascist. Its members came from anarchist, communist, and socialist movements. The Communists constituted the majority, but there were also components such as Republican Vincenzo Baldazzi (who was one of the leaders), and sometimes, as in the defense of Parma, also militants of the (Catholic) Popular Party, such as the adviser Corazza who was killed in Parma in clashes with fascist forces. The movement was born in the summer of 1921 through the work of Argo Secondari, a former lieutenant of the &quot;Black Flame&quot; infantry and an anarchist. The strength of these paramilitary formations were 20,000 men enrolled, among them war veterans, who were neutral or strongly anti-fascist.

Perhaps the most resonant event was the defense of Parma against fascist &quot;squadrismo&quot; in 1922: around 10,000 &quot;squadristi&quot;, first under the command of Roberto Farinacci, then Italo Balbo, had to withdraw from the city after five days of clashes against a group consisting of socialists, anarchists and communists, controlled by the heads of the &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot; (350 took part in the battle against the fascists) Antonio Cieri and Guido Picelli. The Fascist lost 39 men, the &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot; five.

In the following months, many heads of the Arditi del Popolo were jailed or killed by fascist &quot;squadristi&quot;, sometimes with the collusion of police agencies.

==World War II==

&quot;Arditi skiers&quot; (Italian: &quot;Arditi sciatori&quot;) took part in the Battle of France; they formed the Alpine battalion &quot;Duke of Abruzzi&quot;, the autonomous unit &quot;Monte Bianco&quot; and the unit &quot;Arditi Alpieri&quot;. In the African campaign, &quot;Saharan Arditi&quot; operated aboard AB41 armored cars and Fiat and Lancia trucks (Fiat-SPA AS37, SPA-Viberti AS42, and Fiat 634), specifically adapted to the desert context, and equipped with heavy machine guns, light 47mm and 65mm cannons, and anti-aircraft Breda 20/65 Mod. 1935 cannons.

In May 1942, the I Special Arditi Battalion was established. It was formed on 15 May with three companies, each specialized in a mode of infiltration into enemy territory. On 20 July 1942 the Arditi Regiment was established, based in Santa Severa, near Rome, and on 1 August the I Special Arditi Battalion became its first operational unit. On 15 September it was renamed the X Arditi Regiment. It operated in North Africa and in Sicily, including behind enemy lines, until its dissolution in September 1943.

The I Arditi Battalion, which was in Sardinia on 8 September, a territory not occupied by the Germans, joined the Southern Kingdom and in March 1944 became part of the IX Assault Unit of the Italian Co-Belligerent Army. In September, it was renamed the III Battalion &quot;Col Moschin&quot; of the 68th Infantry Regiment &quot;Legnano&quot;, composed of 400 Arditi.

The Regia Aeronautica (Royal Air Force) also formed Arditi units: the ADRA battalion (Arditi Distruttori della Regia Aeronautica) was established on 28 July 1942, and operated during the Allied landing in Sicily. It operated after 8 September 1943, during the Italian Social Republic, with the name ADAR (Arditi Distruttori Aeronautica Repubblicana), based in Tradate. In 1944, the 1st Arditi Paratroopers Regiment &quot;Folgore&quot; (formerly the Paratroopers Regiment &quot;Folgore&quot;) and the 2nd Arditi Paratroopers Regiment &quot;Nembo&quot; (active only with two battalions) were also established for the national republican air force.

<doc id="952194" wikidata="Q319342" url="?curid=952194" title="Art Buchwald">
<text>Arthur Buchwald (; October 20, 1925 – January 17, 2007) was an American humorist best known for his column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. At the height of his popularity, it was published nationwide as a syndicated column in more than 500 newspapers. His column focused on political satire and commentary.

Buchwald had first started writing as a paid journalist in Paris after World War II, where he wrote a column on restaurants and nightclubs, &quot;Paris After Dark&quot;, for the &quot;Paris Herald Tribune,&quot; which later became the &quot;International Herald Tribune.&quot; He was part of a large American expatriate community in those years. After his return to the United States in 1962, he continued to publish his columns and books for the rest of his life. He received the Pulitzer Prize in 1982 for Outstanding Commentary, and in 1991 was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, in addition to other awards.

==Early life==
Buchwald was born in New York City in 1925, to an Austrian-Hungarian Jewish immigrant family. He was the son of Joseph Buchwald, a curtain manufacturer, and Helen (Klineberger). His mother suffered from depression and was later committed to a mental hospital, where she lived for 35 years. Buchwald was the youngest of four children, with three older sisters: Alice, Edith, and Doris. When the family business failed at the start of the Great Depression, Buchwald&#x27;s father put the boy in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum in New York City, as he could not care for him. Buchwald was soon placed in foster homes, and lived in several, including a Queens boarding house for sick children (he had rickets because of poor nutrition). It was operated by Seventh-day Adventists. He stayed in the foster home until he was 5.

Buchwald was eventually reunited with his father and sisters; the family settled in Hollis, a residential community in Queens. Buchwald did not graduate from Forest Hills High School, and ran away from home at age 17.

He wanted to join the United States Marine Corps during World War II but was too young to join without parental or legal guardian consent. He bribed a drunk with half a pint of whiskey to sign as his legal guardian. From October 1942 to October 1945, Buchwald served with the Marines as part of the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing. He spent two years in the Pacific Theater and was discharged from the service as a sergeant. He said of his time in the Marines, &quot;In the Marines, they don&#x27;t have much use for humorists, they beat my brains in.&quot;

==Journalism==
On his return, Buchwald enrolled at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles on the G.I. Bill, despite not having graduated from high school. At USC he became managing editor of the campus magazine &quot;Wampus&quot;; he also wrote a column for the college newspaper, the &quot;Daily Trojan&quot;. The university permitted him to continue his studies after learning he had not graduated from high school, but deemed him ineligible for a degree. After establishing his national reputation and winning the Pulitzer Prize, he was invited as a commencement speaker in 1993 and received an honorary doctorate from the university.

In 1949, Buchwald left USC and bought a one-way ticket to Paris. He got a job as a correspondent for &quot;Variety&quot; in Paris. In January 1950, he took a sample column to the offices of the European edition of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. Titled &quot;Paris After Dark&quot;, it was filled with scraps of offbeat information about Parisian nightlife. Buchwald was hired and joined the editorial staff as a restaurant and nightclub reviewer. His column caught on quickly, and in 1951 Buchwald started another column, &quot;Mostly About People&quot;. They were fused into one under the title &quot;Europe&#x27;s Lighter Side&quot;. Buchwald&#x27;s columns soon began to attract readers on both sides of the Atlantic.

In postwar Paris, Buchwald met many American expatriate writers, going about with Janet Flanner, E.B. White, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and Thornton Wilder. He also had brief encounters with the artist Pablo Picasso, writer Ernest Hemingway, directors Orson Welles and Mike Todd, actress Audrey Hepburn, and attorney Roy Cohn.

In November 1952, Buchwald wrote a column in which he attempted to explain the Thanksgiving holiday to the French, using garbled French translations such as &quot;Kilometres Deboutish&quot; for Myles Standish; Buchwald considered it his favorite column. He published it every Thanksgiving during his lifetime.

Buchwald enjoyed the notoriety he received when U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s press secretary, James Hagerty, took seriously a spoof press conference report claiming that reporters asked questions about the president&#x27;s breakfast habits. After Hagerty called his own conference to denounce the article as &quot;unadulterated rot&quot;, Buchwald famously retorted, &quot;Hagerty is wrong. I write &quot;adulterated&quot; rot.&quot; On August 24, 1959, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in reviewing the history of the European edition of &quot;The Herald Tribune&quot;, reported that Buchwald&#x27;s column had achieved an &quot;institutional quality&quot;.

While in Paris, Buchwald became the only correspondent to substantively interview famous American singer Elvis Presley, who had entered the U.S. Army. They met at the Prince de Galles Hotel, where the soon-to-be Sergeant Presley was staying during a week-end off from his army stint in Germany. Presley&#x27;s impromptu performances at the piano at Le Lido nightclub, as well as his singing for the showgirls after most of the customers had left, became legendary after Buchwald included it in his memoir, &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Have Paris&quot; (1995).

Buchwald returned to the United States in 1962. He wrote as a columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, frequently commenting on the political scene. When once asked where he got his ideas, he said simply that he read the newspaper every day. He could not make up the absurd situations that were reported. His column was syndicated by Tribune Media Services. His column appeared in more than 550 newspapers at its height. He also wrote memoirs and other books, a total of more than 30 in his lifetime. He also contributed fumetti to Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Crazy Magazine&quot;, which tore apart statistics regarding 1970s campus life.

==Marriage and family==

During his time in Paris, Buchwald met Ann McGarry, and they married. She was an Irish-American apprentice couturier from Pennsylvania. After returning to the United States, they later adopted three children. They lived in Washington, D.C., where he wrote for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. They spent most summers at their house in Vineyard Haven on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. After 40 years of marriage, the couple separated, and then decided to get a divorce. However, before the divorce proceedings could start, Ann was diagnosed with lung cancer, and passed away in 1994.

==Film==
Buchwald had a cameo in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955). Near the beginning of the movie, an issue of the &quot;Paris Herald Tribune&quot; is shown in close-up to highlight a column, bylined by Buchwald, about jewel thefts on the French Riviera, which sets up the plot.

He contributed to the English dialogue of Jacques Tati&#x27;s &quot;Playtime&quot;. Buchwald also had a cameo role in a 1972 episode, &quot;Moving Target&quot;, of the TV series &quot;Mannix&quot;. He is shown in Frederick Wiseman&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;The Store&quot; delivering a tribute to Stanley Marcus, the store&#x27;s owner.

In 1988, Buchwald and partner Alain Bernheim filed suit against Paramount Pictures in a controversy over the Eddie Murphy film &quot;Coming to America&quot;. In the &quot;Buchwald v. Paramount&quot; lawsuit, Buchwald claimed Paramount had stolen his script treatment. He won, was awarded damages, and accepted a settlement from Paramount. The case was the subject of a 1992 book, &quot;Fatal Subtraction: The Inside Story of Buchwald v. Paramount&quot;.

==Criticism==

In Buchwald&#x27;s later years, his detractors characterized the column as hackneyed, tiresome and not funny. Political analyst Norman Ornstein in 1991 said he thought Buchwald&#x27;s column was more popular &quot;outside the Beltway&quot;; others disagreed.

Roy Bode, editor of the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;, said that when his paper canceled Buchwald&#x27;s column in 1989, the editors did not receive a single letter of protest. By contrast, when the paper cancelled the comic strip &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot;, so many readers complained that the editors were compelled to bring it back.

In September 2005, Timothy Noah wrote in &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Yes, Buchwald still writes his column. No, it hasn&#x27;t been funny for some time.&quot;

==Illness and death==

Buchwald underwent hospitalization twice for mental disorders: once in 1963 for severe depression. In 1987, he was hospitalized for what was then diagnosed as an extreme episode of bipolar disorder, which he had probably had for years. He publicly recounted these experiences in 1999.

In 2000, at age 74, Buchwald suffered a stroke. He was hospitalized for more than two months. On February 16, 2006, the Associated Press reported that Buchwald had had a leg amputated below the knee and was staying at Washington Home and Hospice. The amputation was reportedly necessary because of poor circulation in the leg, resulting from diabetes.

Buchwald invited radio talk show presenter Diane Rehm to interview him. During the show, which aired on February 24, 2006, he revealed his decision to discontinue hemodialysis, which had previously been initiated to treat kidney failure, another result of his having diabetes mellitus. He described his decision as his &quot;last hurrah&quot;, stating that, &quot;If you have to go, the way you go is a big deal.&quot; He reported that he was &quot;very happy with his choices&quot; and was eating at McDonald&#x27;s on a regular basis.

Buchwald was later interviewed by Miles O&#x27;Brien of CNN, in a segment aired on March 31, 2006. Buchwald discussed his living will, which documented his wishes not to be revived if he fell into a coma. As of the date of that interview, Buchwald was still writing a periodic column. In the interview, he described a dream in which he was waiting to take his &quot;final plane ride&quot;.

Buchwald was interviewed by Fox News&#x27; Chris Wallace for a segment on May 14, 2006&#x27;s edition of &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;.

In June 2006, Buchwald left the hospice. He was again interviewed by Rehm and reported that his kidney was working. He said that he &quot;blesses him every morning. Some people bless their hearts, I bless my kidney.&quot; He reported that he was looking forward to getting a new leg and visiting Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.
In July 2006, Buchwald returned to his summer home in Tisbury on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. While there, he completed a book titled &quot;Too Soon to Say Goodbye&quot;, about the five months he spent in the hospice. Eulogies that were prepared by his friends, colleagues, and family members and were never delivered (or not delivered until later) are included in the book.

On November 3, 2006, television news reporter Kyra Phillips interviewed Buchwald for CNN. Phillips had known Buchwald since 1989, when she had first interviewed him. On November 22, 2006, Buchwald was again featured on Rehm&#x27;s show. He described himself as a &quot;poster boy for hospices – because I lived.&quot;
In December 2006, in his final interview, he told nurse/writer Terry Ratner that he was also a poster boy for nurses. The article, &quot;The &#x27;Art&#x27; of Saying Goodbye&quot;, appeared in the January 2007 issues of &quot;Nursing Spectrum&quot; and &quot;NurseWeek&quot;, national nursing publications.

Buchwald died of kidney failure on January 17, 2007, at his son Joel&#x27;s home in Washington, D.C. The next day the website of &quot;The New York Times&quot; posted a video obituary in which Buchwald said: &quot;Hi. I&#x27;m Art Buchwald, and I just died.&quot;

<text>The Navy Expeditionary Medal is a military award of the United States Navy which was established in August 1936.

==Award criteria==
The General Orders of the Department of the Navy which established the medal states, &quot;The medal will be awarded to the officers and enlisted men of the Navy who were confirmed to have landed on foreign territory and engaged in operations against armed opposition, or operated under circumstances which, after full consideration, shall be deemed to merit special recognition and for which service no campaign medal has been awarded. The Navy Expeditionary Medal is retroactively authorized to February 12, 1874.&quot; 

==Design==
The medal was designed by A. A. Weinman and features a sailor beaching a craft carrying Marines, an officer, and a US flag with the word &quot;Expeditions&quot; above. On the reverse of both the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal and Navy Expeditionary Medal, in the center of the bronze medallion an eagle is shown alight upon an anchor; the eagle is facing to the left and the flukes of the anchor are to the right. The eagle is grasping sprigs of laurel, which extend beyond the anchor in both directions. Above the eagle are the words UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS or UNITED STATES NAVY presented as an arch. Above the laurel are the words FOR SERVICE presented horizontally. The eagle is the American bald eagle and represents the United States, the anchor alludes to Marine Corps or Navy service, and the laurel is symbolic of victory and achievement.

==Marine Corps eligibility==
The medal is one of the few Navy awards which are not concurrently bestowed to the United States Marine Corps, as Marine Corps personnel are eligible for the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal as an equivalent award. In addition, since 1961, some Navy commands have permitted service members to choose between the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for participation in certain operations. Both awards may not be bestowed simultaneously for the same action.

==Additional awards==
Additional awards of the Navy Expeditionary Medal are denoted by service stars. 
==Wake Island Device==
The Wake Island Device is authorized for those service members who were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal through the defense of Wake Island. As the vast majority of the defenders of Wake Island were U.S. Marines, the Navy Expeditionary Medal with the Wake Island device is one of the rarest awards in the U.S. military history, with only 68 eligible recipients.

<text>An obedience school is an institution that trains pets (particularly dogs) how to behave properly. When puppies are young and in the first stages of training, they are often taken by their owners to obedience schools. Training usually takes place in small groups. In addition to training pets themselves, obedience schools also teach pet owners how to train, praise, and scold their pets themselves. Schools can teach at a various set of levels, ranging from the very basics for puppies to more advanced for competition level dogs. Most training in schools however, focuses on making dogs listen through basic commands such as sit, stay, lie down, etc.

==Costs of obedience school ==
The prices of obedience school can vary depending on location, age of the dog, and the amount of training a dog requires. For example, group or class training can cost anywhere from $40–$125 per class, while private training, which may take place in the owners&#x27; home or trainers places of business, may cost anywhere from $30–100 per class. Dogs usually require 6–8 sessions. Other forms of classes are available as well, such as doggy boarding school which can cost about $950–$2,500; this includes 2–4 weeks of board-and-train. The cost of training can vary depending on the age of the dog as well; training an adult dog will cost more than training a puppy. A trainer may also include small additional costs such as training treats or leash/collar.

==Other forms of dog training ==
Obedience schools are dedicated specifically to obedience training. There are other institutions, like major pet stores Petco and Petsmart that offer specific classes dedicated to obedience training. Dog daycares and animal shelters also provide dog training classes for less money than obedience schools. Places may offer classes that vary in different skill level. The American Kennel Club offers a couple different training options for their members. These training options include puppy class, basic class, Canine Good Citizen program, and other training classes for companion events.

==What to expect==
Training classes are meant to teach the pet basic obedience. Beginner classes can include basic commands such as; sit, stay, lay down, and roll over. They will learn not to pull on a leash, not to jump or chew on furniture. They will also gain social skills when meeting new people. Social skills will make the dog more friendly with other dogs as well as humans. This will allow the dog to go more places with the owner. You should also understand when your dog is ready for obedience school. According to the American Kennel Club &quot;classes are divided up between puppy classes, for dogs under five months of age, and adult or advanced classes, for dogs five months and older.&quot; This means you have to make sure you understand what level your dog is at so they have the best outcome.

<doc id="952201" wikidata="Q55654082" url="?curid=952201" title="Murder of Tammy Homolka">
<text>Tammy Lyn Homolka (January 1, 1975 – December 24, 1990) was a Canadian teenager who was killed by her older sister Karla Homolka and Karla&#x27;s husband Paul Bernardo. On Christmas Eve 1990, shortly before what would have been Tammy&#x27;s 16th birthday on New Year&#x27;s Day (January 1, 1991), Karla and Bernardo plied Tammy with alcoholic drinks laced with the sedative Halcion. When she became unconscious, the two raped her. Tammy became sick while sedated and died. After failed attempts to revive her, Karla covered up evidence of the assault and called an ambulance. Her official cause of death was listed as choking to death on her own vomit, and was believed at the time to have been an accident. After the killers were arrested for the murders of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, Tammy Homolka&#x27;s body was exhumed. She is interred at Victoria Lawn Cemetery in St. Catharines, Ontario.

==Biography==
Tammy Homolka grew up in the neighbourhood of Port Credit to a Czech father and a Canadian mother. She was known for her athletic abilities and she avidly participated in a variety of sports, including track and field, cross country running, and soccer, with soccer being her favourite. She was a grade 10 student at Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines at the time of her death.

==Bernardo&#x27;s involvement==

From the beginning of their relationship, Karla noticed that Bernardo had taken a particular liking to Tammy. He would often pay special attention to her, and even went so far as to have his girlfriend pretend to be her sister during sex. In September 1990, Karla agreed to allow Paul to rape Tammy. She obtained a bottle of Halothane (a liquid general anesthetic) from the veterinary clinic where she worked, which would later be used to sedate Tammy while the two raped her. On December 24, 1990, Tammy was drugged with a combination of Halcion and alcohol, passing out in the family room in the basement of the Homolka house. Tammy&#x27;s parents and sister Lori were upstairs asleep at the time. They filmed the entire rape, taking turns holding the camera while using the Halothane to keep Tammy unconscious.

Three weeks after Tammy Homolka&#x27;s death, Karla and Bernardo filmed a video called &quot;The Fireside Chat&quot; within the Homolka residence. The video was eventually viewed as court evidence. It started in the basement recreation room and at some point the filming moved into Tammy&#x27;s bedroom. While they were in the recreation room, Karla admitted to Bernardo that she enjoyed Bernardo&#x27;s rape of Tammy. She also said in the video that she would like to leave a rose at Tammy&#x27;s grave site. When they were in Tammy&#x27;s bedroom, Karla dressed up in Tammy&#x27;s clothing as well as acting like her sister. They had sex on Tammy&#x27;s bed.

In 2001, the magazine &quot;Elm Street&quot; published an article in which it implied that forensic evidence proved that Tammy&#x27;s death was not an accident and that her sister had deliberately administered an overdose of halothane. The magazine described Karla as a &quot;malignant narcissist&quot; who was so incensed by her fiancé&#x27;s attraction to her sister that she took steps to remove Tammy from his affections permanently.

==Implications of Karla Homolka&#x27;s plea bargain==
On February 26, 1993, the defense lawyer and the Crown began negotiations on a 10-year sentence for Karla in exchange for her testimony and full disclosure of all crimes. At the time of the negotiations, the role she and Bernardo had played in Tammy&#x27;s death was not known. When she was admitted for psychiatric assessment in March 1993, Karla confessed in a letter to her parents about her involvement in Tammy&#x27;s death. When the plea agreement was finalized, the initial 10-year sentence was still intact, with two years added for Tammy&#x27;s death. Karla was officially sentenced to 12 years on July 6, 1993.

On July 20, 1993, Tammy&#x27;s body was exhumed. Inside her casket was a wedding invitation for Karla and Bernardo&#x27;s wedding, as well as some notes. Other members of the Homolka family asked that the items be removed before Tammy&#x27;s re-interment.

==In popular culture==
=== Literature ===
* &quot;Invisible Darkness&quot; by Stephen Williams focuses primarily on Karla&#x27;s involvement in the crimes she committed with Bernardo.
* &quot;Deadly Innocence&quot; by Scott Burnside and Alan Cairns

=== Television and film ===
In 2006, the American film &quot;Karla&quot; premiered. It was told from Karla Homolka&#x27;s point of view. In the film, Tammy Homolka&#x27;s death is featured in one of the scenes. Laura Prepon portrayed Karla, Misha Collins portrayed Paul Bernardo, and Cherilyn Hayres portrayed Tammy Homolka.

<text>Lubbock is a small lunar impact crater on the western edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It was named after British astronomer John Lubbock. It is located to the north of the crater Gutenberg and south of Secchi. Lubbock is circular, with a low rim and flat interior. There is a small break in the eastern wall.

On the mare to the south of the patch of highland containing Lubbock is the rille system designated Rimae Goclenius. The parallel rays from the crater pair of Messier and Messier A reaches the rim of Lubbock H to the north.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lubbock.

<doc id="952204" wikidata="Q3401100" url="?curid=952204" title="Tiffany Aching">
<text>Tiffany Aching is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s satirical &quot;Discworld&quot; series of fantasy novels. Her name in Nac Mac Feegle is Tir-far-thóinn or &#x27;Land Under Wave&#x27;.

Tiffany is a trainee witch whose growth into her job forms one of the many arcs in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. She is the main character in &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;. Tiffany grows up over the course of the series, from nine years old in &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; to being in her late teens in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;.

==Works==
Beginning with &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; in 2003, the main Discworld books featuring Tiffany Aching are:
* &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; – 2003
* &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; – 2004
* &quot;Wintersmith&quot; – 2006
* &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; – 2010
* &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot; – 2015

Tiffany is also the in-universe author of the tie-in book &quot;Tiffany Aching’s Guide to Being a Witch&quot; by Rhianna Pratchett and Gabrielle Kent, published in 2023 in part to celebrate twenty years of the character.

==Creation==

Pratchett once said that Tiffany Aching &quot;started with a girl lying down by a river, on the first page of &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;&quot;. In his youth, Pratchett was &quot;fascinated&quot; by a nearby chalk pit, and like Tiffany knew how to read words before being able to pronounce them. &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; features &quot;a lot of [his] past&quot; in its descriptions. A lot of Tiffany&#x27;s understanding of the world is based on Pratchett&#x27;s own experiences.

With Tiffany, Pratchett wanted to &quot;restate&quot; the purpose of magic on the Discworld and the relationship between wizards, witches and others. He included ideas of responsibility and &quot;guarding your society&quot; as he felt it drew closer to the reality of a witch – that is, &quot;the village herbalist, the midwife, the person who knew things&quot;; like a designated driver, a witch is her community&#x27;s &#x27;designated sensible person&#x27;. Pratchett found a young protagonist useful, because when one is young &quot;you have to learn&quot;. The name &quot;Tiffany&quot; was chosen deliberately, to be poorly evocative of a witch.

==Character history==
A young witch (9 during &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, 11 in &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, 12 and 13 in &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, almost 16 in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, and in her late teens in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;), Tiffany hails from the Chalk, a Barony and a region of Downland Rimward of the Ramtops. Her family the Achings are the tenants of the Home Farm of the local Barony, the de Chumsfanleigh (pronounced &quot;de Chuffley&quot;). Her late grandmother, Sarah &#x27;Granny&#x27; Aching (who died 2 years prior to the events in &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;), was a shepherdess, and by Ramtop standards she was also a witch, although witchcraft was frowned upon on the Chalk until Tiffany openly practised it. Granny Aching was a friend of the Chalk&#x27;s Clan of Nac Mac Feegles (an army of tiny, tattoed in blue colour, rowdy, drunken and vaguely Scottish &#x27;pictsies&#x27;), and they have befriended Tiffany as the new &quot;hag o&#x27; the hills&quot;. As Tiffany filled in as their Kelda (Queen) for a short time, the Nac Mac Feegle continue to see her as their responsibility, and there is no time in Tiffany&#x27;s life since then which when they have not (in)discreetly watched her.

Tiffany begins her witching career at nine, upon being scouted out by the &quot;witch finder&quot; Miss Tick, after things from Fairyland begin making an entrance. She later leads the Feegles on a journey into Fairyland to rescue Wentworth, her toddler-age brother, as well as Roland, the young son of the local Baron, from the Queen of the Elves. For this she earns the respect of Granny Weatherwax, a significant achievement in itself. Although Tiffany is too young at the time to be an official witch, Granny gives her an imaginary invisible hat to boost her confidence. Such is the power of belief on the Disc that this hat keeps off the rain.

Two years later, Tiffany travels up to Lancre to be formally apprenticed to a witch, Miss Level. During her time with Miss Level, Tiffany uses the words &quot;see me&quot; to exit her body and see herself, believing it to be a harmless trick. Her body becomes vulnerable to infestation by a &quot;hiver,&quot; (a gestalt entity of minds from the dawn of time) which uses her power to harm and cause chaos, using Tiffany&#x27;s suppressed thoughts and desires as a basis. She eventually manages to overcome the hiver by giving it what it truly wants: the ability to die.
At the age of thirteen, while studying under Miss Treason, Tiffany accidentally attracts the romantic interests of the Wintersmith after unwittingly playing the role of the Summer Lady at the Autumn Morris Dance (the so-called Dark Morris). She is at first ambivalent towards the Wintersmith, unnerved by the attention, but also somewhat flattered that she has caught the eye of a godlike being. The Wintersmith continues its advances, even attempting to create a human body out of snow and miscellaneous elements using a recipe from a children&#x27;s song.

Tiffany, after some advice from Nanny Ogg about the power a young woman has over a suitor, manages to control the Wintersmith for a time. However, eventually he gains the upper hand and brings a record-breaking snow and cold to the Chalk in what should be early spring, threatening the new lambs. Tiffany melts him using a trick taught by Granny Weatherwax, fulfilling her temporary role as the Summer Lady and allowing the real one, brought from the Underworld by Roland, to resume her role. After Miss Treason&#x27;s death, she is briefly apprenticed to Nanny Ogg before returning to the Chalk and taking up the job of witch to the Chalk.

When Tiffany is in her late teens, Granny Weatherwax dies, leaving a note recommending that Tiffany take over her steading. Though at first she splits her time between there and the chalk, she eventually leaves the steading to the care of Geoffrey, a young man she had been training to become a witch. She builds for herself her own shepherd&#x27;s carding hut by hand, so as to live up on the chalk, re-using the iron wheels which remained after Granny Aching&#x27;s hut was burned.

==Powers and abilities==
As a witch, Tiffany possesses First Sight, the ability to see &quot;what is really there&quot; (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as &quot;the thoughts you think about the way you think&quot;. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts one thinks about the way one thinks about the way one thinks), and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts one thinks about the way one thinks about the way one thinks about the way one thinks). All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.

Like her grandmother, she appears to have a symbiotic, spiritual link with the hill lands on which she lives, and as such has shown herself to be strongly protective of the region and all its inhabitants. On several occasions, Tiffany has induced in herself a state of total mental clarity, becoming completely aware of every sensation, life-form and object around her, including the land itself. It is also hinted at that the Chalk itself can, likewise, &#x27;Borrow&#x27; the witch it &#x27;Chose&#x27;, having once temporarily spoken through Tiffany, telling her childhood friend, Roland, that she would marry him (and later performing an ancient marriage ceremony on Roland and his fiancée, Letitia).

Tiffany has shown skill in many of the same areas of magic as Granny Weatherwax (though generally to a lesser degree): she has precociously mastered the art of Borrowing (the art of stepping outside one&#x27;s own self), though Tiffany did not recognise it at the time, and merely used it as a means of viewing herself when without a mirror. The resulting vacancy of her body was what attracted the hiver to possess her in &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;. In &quot;Wintersmith&quot; she demonstrates a high level of skill in the art of magical self-concealment, and also learns how to absorb heat from any available source (including the sun) and channel it out into the world, without being touched by it herself. She generally precedes the use of the latter art with a sort of mantra, in which she states that she willingly chooses to undertake the dangerous action, and is prepared to accept full responsibility for all its consequences. Also like Granny, she has great difficulty in constructing the magical devices known as &#x27;shambles&#x27;, though unlike Granny, she later overcomes this obstacle. Tiffany has also demonstrated an affinity for using fire, which she considers a friend (most witches do not consider fire to have good associations for them in view of its history).

In &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; it is revealed that in the future, Tiffany is able to exert a limited amount of influence over events throughout the timeline with the help of Eskarina Smith, the main character of &quot;Equal Rites&quot;.

Tiffany is very skilled at making cheese; and owns one particular Blue Lancre, named Horace, which habitually eats mice. She has read the entire dictionary, although she sometimes has difficulty with pronunciation. Tiffany also has a talent with languages, a side effect of the encounter with the Hiver. The occupation of her mind by the creature that collected minds has left her with shadows of those memories, including a deceased, didactic wizard named Sensibility Bustle, who translates any foreign word inside her head upon hearing or seeing it. Tiffany is also able to hear &quot;Spill Words&quot;, the words almost spoken but left unsaid, a skill she learnt from Mrs Proust. This skill is often mistaken for the ability to read minds.

At the climax of events in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, it is revealed that Tiffany, as the Witch of the Chalk, also has powers and authority not unlike a Justice of the peace; she is able to perform binding marriage ceremonies, and judge and deal out punishment onto the deserving.

==Relationships==
Tiffany is the seventh of the Aching children, and the second youngest, the youngest child being her only brother, Wentworth. Both her parents are alive, but she attracts little attention around the house, because she does her job well, which means nobody ever has to come and fuss over her, which in turn means nobody ever pays a lot of attention to her. While she does not particularly like her brother, she sets out to rescue him because he is brother.

She is friends with several of the Nac Mac Feegle, including Rob Anybody (originally, but accidentally, her betrothed), Daft Wullie (somewhat clueless), William the Gonnagle, Hamish, and Not-as-big-as-Medium-sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock Jock.

While training in Lancre, she attended a coven of young witches &#x27;led&#x27; by Annagramma Hawkin. Tiffany and fellow coven members Lucy Warbeck and Petulia Gristle eventually acquit themselves well as witches; Annagramma, however, finds that her training, under the tutelage of Letice Earwig, had not been enough to prepare her for the reality of witching life, and her onetime coven subordinates agree to help her get on her feet.

Roland comes to have great affection for Tiffany and takes the role of the mythic hero, attempting to rescue her from the Underworld and from the romantic attentions of the Wintersmith. Tiffany herself denies having any affection for Roland, but there are many signs that she does have feelings for him, even though she does not admit it until pressured to by Nanny Ogg. However, both eventually recognise that their both being different from everybody else did not mean they had anything in common, and Roland eventually married a local noblewoman (and latent witch) Letitia Keepsake.

During the fourth book, &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, it is revealed near the end that she has entered into a romantic relationship with an intelligent young guard, named Preston, who aspires to study medicine at the Lady Sybil Free Hospital down in the city of Ankh-Morpork, under Dr John Lawn, and further wishes to start a medical practice of his own up in the Chalk.

In &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, Tiffany is still romantically attached to Preston, who has become a surgeon, though, given their devotion to their jobs, they rarely have time to see each other. She visits him in Ankh-Morpork, and they write letters.

Tiffany is mentored by Granny Weatherwax, and is named her successor. Granny Weatherwax, who is notoriously difficult to please, has several times been impressed by her.

Eskarina Smith, the protagonist of &quot;Equal Rites&quot;, tells Tiffany in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; that they become close friends. Eskarina uses her time travelling abilities to facilitate a meeting between Tiffany and her older self.

==Reception==
Tim Martin of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; called Tiffany one of Pratchett&#x27;s ten best &quot;Discworld&quot; characters, criticising &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; but calling the first three Aching novels &quot;some of the best Discworld stuff in years&quot;. On the occasion of Pratchett&#x27;s death in 2015, the Press Association listed Tiffany as Pratchett&#x27;s seventh greatest character, highlighting her relationship with the Nac Mac Feegle. According to Pratchett, his portrayal of Tiffany led to him being made an honorary Brownie. Pratchett has called the Tiffany Aching books &quot;very close to my heart&quot;, and has said they are the books he would like to be &quot;remembered for&quot;.

<text>The Vympel NPO R-77 missile (NATO reporting name: AA-12 Adder) is a Russian active radar homing beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. It is also known by its export designation RVV-AE. It is the Russian counterpart to the American AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.

The R-77 was marked by a severely protracted development. Work began in the 1980s, but was not completed before the Soviet Union fell. For many years, only the RVV-AE model was produced for export customers. Production was further disrupted when the Russo-Ukrainian War resulted in a Ukrainian arms embargo against Russia, severing supply chains. The Russian Aerospace Forces finally entered the R-77-1 (AA-12B) into service in 2015. It was subsequently deployed by Su-35S fighters in Syria on combat air patrols. The export model of the R-77-1 is called RVV-SD.

==Development==
Work on the R-77 began in 1982 by „Molnija OKB“ in Ukrainian SSR. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the R-77 (Izdelie 170) missiles were produced in Kyiv&#x27;s &quot;Artem&quot; plant. It represented Ukraine&#x27;s and later also Russia&#x27;s first multi-purpose missile for tactical and strategic aircraft for fire-and-forget use against aircraft ranging from hovering helicopters to high-speed, low-altitude aircraft. Gennadiy Sokolovski, general designer of the Vympel Design Bureau, said that the R-77 missile can be used against medium and long range air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-54 Phoenix, as well as SAMs such as the Patriot. The munition has a laser-triggered proximity fuze and an expanding rod warhead that can destroy targets of various sizes. It can be used against cruise missiles and precision-guided munitions (PGMs). First seen in 1992 at the Moscow Airshow (MAKS) 1992, the R-77 was immediately nicknamed Amraamski by Western journalists. The basic R-77 is known as the &quot;izdeliye&quot; 170, while the export variant is known as the &quot;izdeliye&quot; 190 or RVV-AE. The R-77 and RVV-AE have a range of . Vympel did not have adequate funding during the 1990s and the first part of the following decade to support further evolution of the R-77, either for the Russian Air Force or the export market. The basic version of the R-77 is not thought to have entered the Russian Aerospace Forces inventory in significant numbers.

The R-77 can be used by upgraded Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 variants in Russian Aerospace Forces service. Some variants of the Su-27 in China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force, including the domestically produced J-11 variants, can also employ the missile. The newer Su-30MKK has a N001 (Su-27 radar) with a digital bypass channel incorporating a mode allowing it to use R-77s. The export RVV-AE has been sold widely, with China and India placing significant orders for the munition, as was the case for the R-73. The baseline R-77 was designed in the 1980s, with development complete by around 1994. India was the first export customer for the export variant, known as the RVV-AE, with the final batch delivered in 2002.

There are other variants under development. One has an upgraded motor to extend a range at high altitudes to as much as 120–160 km; it is known as the RVV-AE-PD (&quot;Povyshenoy Dalnosti&quot;—improved range). This variant has been test-fired and uses a solid-fuel ramjet engine. Its range puts it in the long-range class and is equivalent in range to the AIM-54 Phoenix. In another version of the R-77, a terminal infrared homing seeker is offered. This is in line with the Russian practice of attacking targets by firing pairs of missiles with different homing systems. This complicates end-game defensive actions for the target aircraft, as it needs to successfully defeat two homing systems. If a radar-guided medium-range missile is fired at an enemy jet aircraft outside the non-escape attack zone, the target aircraft may be able to escape through emergency maneuver. But at this moment, in fact, the infrared guidance has an advantage: once the jet aircraft turns to escape, the engine nozzle is exposed, and the infrared characteristics are exposed. This method of attack may not always be available as IR seekers typically have less range and less resistance to poor weather than radar seekers, which may limit the successful use of mixed seeker attacks unless the IR missile is initially directed by radar or some other means.

Another improvement program was designated the R-77M, which made the missile longer and heavier, making use of a two-stage motor as well as an improved seeker. A further product-improvement of the R-77, designated the R-77M1 and then the R-77-PD, was to feature a ramjet propulsion device. This missile was destined for the MiG 1.44 that for the MFI program. The munition has a laser fuse and an expanding rod warhead that can destroy the variable sized targets. However, due to funding shortage and eventual cancellation of the MiG 1.44, development of this model may have stopped by 1999; no information or announcement regarding the R-77M and R-77-PD has appeared since.

=== Further development ===
Tactical Missile Weapons Corporation, also known as TRV (&quot;Takticheskoe Raketnoe Vooruzhenie – Тактическое Ракетное Вооружение&quot;), unveiled the RVV-SD and RVV-MD missiles for the first time at the Moscow Air Show (MAKS) in August 2009. The RVV-SD is an improved version of the R-77, while the RVV-MD is a variant of the R-73. The RVV-SD includes the upgrades associated with the &quot;izdeliye&quot; 170-1, or R-77-1. The RVV-SD, along with the RVV-MD, seem to be part of Russia&#x27;s bid for India&#x27;s medium multirole combat aircraft competition. Both designations were included by MiG on a presentation covering MiG-35 Fulcrum armament during Aero India Air Show in February. The initial RVV-SD offering is likely no more than a stopgap to try to maintain its position, and to provide a credible radar-guided weapon to offer as part of fighter export packages and upgrade programs.

According to specifications, the R-77-1 and its export variant RVV-SD is heavier than the basic R-77 / RVV-AE, weighing rather than . Maximum range is increased to from . The missile is also slightly longer at , rather than the of the basic variant. Additional improvements include upgrades to the missile&#x27;s radar seeker and boat tail rear section to reduce drag. Russian missile manufacturer Agat previously confirmed it was working on seeker upgrades for the R-77, implying that at least two projects were underway, one for export and one for the Russian Air Force.

Vympel, a which had merged to be part of TRV, has been developing a more extensive upgrade of the missile than the R-77-1. Designated the &quot;izdeliye&quot; 180, or K-77M, this missile is a mid-life upgrade for the missile and is intended to be the main medium-range missile for the Sukhoi Su-57. This upgrade aims to provide a further improvement in range, with the design including a dual-pulse motor configuration. The &quot;izdeliye&quot; 180 will use an active electronically scanned array seeker and conventional rear fins instead of the R-77&#x27;s lattice fins. This missile is intended to match the performance of the latest AIM-120 variants. Though it uses a similar designation as the earlier R-77M improvement program, it is not known if these two missiles are the same or are related.

On October 4, 2020 footage of Su-57 fighter flying with R-77M missile was revealed in a video released by the Russian Defense Ministry commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center

==Design description==
For the first forty years, the aerodynamics combined vestigial cruciform wings with grid fins used as tail control surfaces (similar devices are used on the OTR-23 Oka, and USAF uses them on MOAB). The flow separation which occurs at high angles of attack enhances its turning ability, giving the missile a maximum turn rate of up to 150° per second. However, the grid fins also increase drag and radar cross section. Updated variants of the R-77, such as the &quot;izdeliye&quot; 180 that is destined for the Sukhoi Su-57, will use conventional fins instead.

The missile uses a multi-function doppler-monopulse active radar seeker developed by OAO Agat. The radar features two modes of operation, over short distances, the missile will launch in an active &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; mode. Over longer distances the missile is controlled by an inertial guidance auto pilot with occasional encoded data link updates from the launch aircraft&#x27;s radar on changes in spatial position or G of the target. As the missile comes within of its target, the missile switches to its active radar mode. The host radar system maintains computed target information in case the target breaks the missile&#x27;s lock-on.

==Operational history==
At the beginning of February 2016, four Su-35S were deployed to Syria as part of the Russian aerial expeditionary force to the country. Tasked with air to air duties, the Su-35S were extensively documented while armed with a couple of R-77 missiles, between IR seeking R-27T under the inner pylons and R-73 under the outer ones.

<text>A coal-seam fire is a burning of an outcrop or underground coal seam. Most coal-seam fires exhibit smouldering combustion, particularly underground coal-seam fires, because of limited atmospheric oxygen availability. Coal-seam fire instances on Earth date back several million years. Due to thermal insulation and the avoidance of rain/snow extinguishment by the crust, underground coal-seam fires are the most persistent fires on Earth and can burn for thousands of years, like Burning Mountain in Australia. Coal-seam fires can be ignited by self-heating of low-temperature oxidation, lightning, wildfires and even arson. Coal-seam fires have been slowly shaping the lithosphere and changing atmosphere, but this pace has become faster and more extensive in modern times, triggered by mining.

Coal fires are a serious health and safety hazard, affecting the environment by releasing toxic fumes; reigniting grass, brush, or forest fires; and causing subsidence of surface infrastructure such as roads, railways, pipelines, electric lines, bridge supports, buildings, and homes. Whether started by humans or by natural causes, coal-seam fires continue to burn for decades, centuries, or even millennia, until one of the following occurs: either the fuel source is exhausted, a permanent groundwater table is encountered, the depth of the burn becomes greater than the ground&#x27;s capacity to subside and vent, or humans intervene. Because they burn underground, coal-seam fires are extremely difficult and costly to extinguish, and are unlikely to be suppressed by rainfall. There are strong similarities between coal fires and peat fires.

Across the world, thousands of underground coal fires are burning at any given moment. The problem is most acute in industrializing, coal-rich nations such as China. Global coal fire emissions are estimated to cause 40 tons of mercury to enter the atmosphere annually, and to represent three percent of the world&#x27;s annual CO2 emissions.

== Origins ==

Coal-seam fires can be divided into near-surface fires, in which seams extend to the surface and the oxygen required for their ignition comes from the atmosphere, and fires in deep underground mines, where the oxygen comes from ventilation.

Mine fires may begin as a result of an industrial accident, generally involving a gas explosion. Historically, some mine fires were started when bootleg mining was stopped by authorities, usually by blowing the mine up. Many recent mine fires have started from people burning trash in a landfill that was in proximity to abandoned coal mines, including the much-publicized Centralia, Pennsylvania, fire, which has been burning since 1962. Of the hundreds of mine fires in the United States burning today, most are found in the state of Pennsylvania.

Some fires along coal seams are natural occurrences. Some coals may self-ignite at temperatures as low as 40 °C (104 °F) for brown coal in the right conditions of moisture and grain size. The fire usually begins a foot or two inside the coal at a depth in which the permeability of the coal allows the inflow of air but in which the ventilation does not remove the heat which is generated. Self-ignition was a recognised problem in steamship times. One well known source of fires is mining breaking into a high pressure cavity of methane gas which on release can generate a spark of static electricity to ignite the gas and start a coal explosion and fire. The same gas static is well known in ships and care has to be taken to ensure no such static sparking can occur.

Two basic factors determine whether spontaneous combustion occurs or not, the ambient temperature and the grain size:

* The higher the ambient temperature, the more quickly the oxidation reactions proceed.
* The grain size and structure determine its surface area. Kinetics will be limited by availability of reactant, which in this case is carbon exposed to oxygen.

Wildfires (lightning-caused or others) can ignite the coal close to the surface or the entrance of a mine, and the smouldering fire can spread through the seam, creating subsidence that may open further seams to oxygen and spawn future wildfires when the fire breaks to the surface. Prehistoric clinker outcrops in the American West are the result of prehistoric coal fires that left a residue that resists erosion better than the matrix, leaving buttes and mesa. It is estimated that Australia&#x27;s Burning Mountain, the oldest known coal fire, has burned for 6,000 years.

Globally, thousands of inextinguishable mine fires are burning, especially in China where poverty, lack of government regulations and runaway development combine to create an environmental disaster. Modern strip mining exposes smouldering coal seams to the air, revitalizing the flames.

Rural Chinese in coal-bearing regions often dig coal for household use, abandoning the pits when they become too deep, leaving highly combustible coal dust exposed to the air. Using satellite imagery to map China&#x27;s coal fires resulted in the discovery of many previously unknown fires. The oldest coal fire in China is in Baijigou (白芨沟, in Dawukou District of Shizuishan, Ningxia) and is said to have been burning since the Qing Dynasty (before 1912).

==Detection==
Before attempting to extinguish a near-surface coal-seam fire, its location and underground extent should be determined as precisely as possible. Besides studying the geographic, geologic and infrastructural context, information can be gained from direct measurements. These include:
* Temperature measurements of the land surface, in fissures and boreholes, for example using pyrometers
* Gas measurements to characterize the fire ventilation system (amount and velocity) and the gas composition, so that the combustion reactions can be described
* Geophysical measurements on the ground and from aircraft to establish the extent of conductivity or other underground parameters. For example, conductivity measurements map humidity changes near the fire; measuring magnetism can determine changes in the magnetic characteristics of the adjacent rock caused by heat
* Remote sensing from aircraft and satellites. High resolution optical mapping, thermal imaging and hyperspectral data play a role. Underground coal fires of several hundred to over a thousand degrees Celsius may raise the surface temperature by only a few degrees. This order of magnitude is similar to the temperature difference between the sunlit and shadowed slopes of a slag heap or sand dune. Infrared detecting equipment is able to track the fire&#x27;s location as the fire heats the ground on all sides of it. However, remote sensing techniques are unable to distinguish individual fires burning near one another and often lead to undercounting of actual fires. They may also have some difficulties distinguishing coal-seam fires from forest fires. Combining in-situ data with remote sensing data does allow for monitoring of coal fire intensity over longer periods using time-series analyses.

Underground coal mines can be equipped with permanently installed sensor systems. These relay pressure, temperature, airflow and gas composition measurements to the safety monitoring personnel, giving them early warning of any problems.

== Environmental impact ==

Besides destruction of the affected areas, coal fires often emit toxic gases, including carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide. China&#x27;s coal fires, which consume an estimated 20 – 200 million tons of coal a year, make up as much as 1 percent of the global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.

One of the most visible changes will be subsidence. Another local environmental effect can include the presence of plants or animals that are aided by the coal fire. The prevalence of non-native plants can depend upon the fire&#x27;s duration and the size of the affected area. For example, near a coal fire in Germany, many Mediterranean insects and spiders were identified in a region with cold winters, and it is believed that elevated ground temperatures above the fires permitted their survival.

== Extinguishing coal fires ==
In order to thrive, a fire requires fuel, oxygen, and heat. As underground fires are very difficult to reach directly, fire fighting involves finding an appropriate methodology which addresses the interaction of fuel and oxygen for the specific fire in question. A fire can be isolated from its fuel source, for example through firebreaks or fireproof barriers. Many fires, particularly those on steep slopes, can be completely excavated. In the case of near-surface coal-seam fires, the influx of oxygen in the air can be interrupted by covering the area or installing gas-tight barriers. Another possibility is to hinder the outflow of combustion gases so that the fire is quenched by its own exhaust fumes. Energy can be removed by cooling, usually by injecting large amounts of water. However, if any remaining dry coal absorbs water, the resulting heat of absorption can lead to re-ignition of a once-quenched fire as the area dries. Accordingly, more energy must be removed than the fire generates. In practice these methods are combined, and each case depends on the resources available. This is especially true for water, for example in arid regions, and for covering material, such as loess or clay, to prevent contact with the atmosphere.

Extinguishing underground coal fires, which sometimes exceed temperatures of 540 °C (1,000 °F), is both highly dangerous and very expensive.

Near-surface coal-seam fires are routinely extinguished in China following a standard method basically consisting of the following phases:

* Smoothing the surface above the fire with heavy equipment to make it fit for traffic.
* Drilling holes in the fire zone about 20 m apart down to the source of the fire, following a regular grid.
* Injecting water or mud in the boreholes long term, usually 1 to 2 years.
* Covering the entire area with an impermeable layer about 1 m thick, e.g., of loess.
* Planting vegetation to the extent the climate allows.

Efforts are underway to refine this method, for example with additives to the quenching water or with alternative extinguishing agents.

Underground coal-seam fires are customarily quenched by inertisation through mine rescue personnel. Toward this end the affected area is isolated by dam constructions in the galleries. Then an inert gas, usually nitrogen, is introduced, usually making use of available pipelines.

In 2004, the Chinese government claimed success in extinguishing a mine fire at a colliery near Urumqi in China&#x27;s Xinjiang province that had been burning since 1874. However, a March 2008 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article quotes researcher Steven Q. Andrews as saying, &quot;I decided to go to see how it was extinguished, and flames were visible and the entire thing was still burning. ... They said it was put out, and who is to say otherwise?&quot;

A jet engine unit, known as Gorniczy Agregat Gasniczy (GAG), was developed in Poland and successfully used for fighting coal fires and displacing firedamp in mines.

== Current research and new developments in extinguishing fires ==
&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported in July 2010 that less expensive alternatives for extinguishing coal-seam fires were beginning to reach the market, including heat-resistant grouts and a fire-smothering nitrogen foam, with other innovative solutions on the way.

==List of mine fires==
Some of the more notable mine fires around the world are listed below.

===Australia===
* Burning Mountain – a naturally occurring, slow-combusting underground coal seam, it has been burning for over 5500 years.
* Hill End Colliery fire – a coal-seam fire at Cessnock, New South Wales, that burned from, at latest, August 1930 to probably as late as June 1949.
* Blair Athol coal mine – a mine, near Clermont, Queensland, that has been the site of a number of fires, one of which burned underground for 54 years.
* Morwell, Victoria – the Great Morwell open cut mine caught fire in March 1902 and burned for over a month. It was extinguished by breaching the nearby Morwell River with explosives to flood the mine. The fire was found to have been caused by sabotage from incendiary devices.
* Hazelwood Power Station – a 2 km coal face in the Hazelwood open cut mine was set alight by a bushfire in October 2006 and again in February 2014. Thousands of residents were affected by the fire at the Hazelwood coal mine in 2014 which burned for 45 days sending smoke across the community of Morwell in Victoria. Government advised the vulnerable groups of people in South Morwell to relocate temporarily due to the danger of PM2.5 particulate matter. In May 2020 the Hazelwood Power Corporation was fined $1.56 million for occupational health and safety breaches associated with the fire.

===Canada===
*Elkford, British Columbia
*Merritt, British Columbia
*Carmacks, Yukon
*Smoking Hills, Northwest Territories

===China===
In China, the world&#x27;s largest coal producer with an annual output around 2.5 billion tons, coal fires are a serious problem. It has been estimated that some 10–200 million tons of coal uselessly burn annually, and that the same amount again is made inaccessible to mining. Coal fires extend over a belt across the entire north China, whereby over one hundred major fire areas are listed, each of which contains many individual fire zones. They are concentrated in the provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia. Beside losses from burned and inaccessible coal, these fires contribute to air pollution and considerably increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions and have thereby become a problem which has gained international attention.

===France===

In Saint-Etienne coal basin, five burning hills (montagnes de feu) have been described from the early 17th Century to the early 19th century around the city of Saint-Etienne. Some of these fires were reported burning for 3 centuries. Most of them were extinguished in 1785 These old burning hills correspond today to the &quot;Mont Salson&quot;, &quot;Bois d&#x27;Avaize&quot; and &quot;Cote Chaude&quot; in Saint-Etienne, la &quot;colline du Brûlé&quot; in la Ricamarie and &quot;Le mont du Feu&quot; (Mount of fire) in Genilac. The fire in Genilac lasted 30 years from 1740. Outcrops of pyrometamorphic rocks generated by these fires are visible today on &quot;Mont Salson&quot; and &quot;bois d&#x27;Avaize&quot;.

===Germany===
In Planitz, now a part of the city of Zwickau, a coal seam that had been burning since 1476 was only quenched in 1860. In Dudweiler, Saarland, a coal-seam fire ignited around 1668 and is still burning. This so-called &quot;Burning Mountain&quot; (&quot;Brennender Berg&quot;) soon became a tourist attraction and was even visited by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Also well-known is the so-called &quot;Stinksteinwand&quot; (&quot;stinking stone wall&quot;) in Schwalbenthal on the eastern slope of the Hoher Meißner, where several seams caught fire centuries ago after lignite coal mining ceased; combustion gas continues to reach the surface.

===India===
In India, as of 2010, 68 fires were burning beneath a region of the Jharia coalfield in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. Mine fires started in this region in 1916 and are rapidly destroying the only source of prime coking coal in the country as well as the surrounding areas due to land subsidence and pollution.

===Indonesia===
Coal and peat fires in Indonesia are often ignited by forest fires near deposits at the surface. It is difficult to determine when a forest fire is started by a coal-seam fire, or vice versa. The most common cause of forest fires and haze in Indonesia is intentional burning of forest to clear land for plantation crops of pulp wood, rubber and palm oil.

No accurate count of coal-seam fires has been completed in Indonesia. Only a minuscule fraction of the country has been surveyed for coal fires. The best data available come from a study based on systematic, on-the-ground observation. In 1998, a total of 125 coal fires were located and mapped within a 2-kilometre strip either side of a 100-kilometre stretch of road north of Balikpapan to Samarinda in East Kalimantan, using hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. Extrapolating this data to areas on Borneo and Sumatra underlain by known coal deposits, it was estimated that more than 250,000 coal-seam fires may have been burning in Indonesia in 1998.

Land clearing practices which use fire, often starting forest fires, may be the cause of coal-seam fires in Indonesia. In 1982 and 1983 one of the largest forest fires in this century raged for several months through an estimated 5 million hectares of Borneo&#x27;s tropical rainforests. Goldammer and Seibert however concluded that there are indications that coal-seam fires already occurred between 13,200 and 15,000 BP.

A fire season usually occurs every 3 to 5 years, when the climate in parts of Indonesia becomes exceptionally dry from June to November due to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation off the west coast of South America. Since 1982, fire has been a recurring feature on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, burning large areas in 1987, 1991, 1994, 1997–1998, 2001 and 2004.

In October 2004 smoke from land clearing again covered substantial portions of Borneo and Sumatra, disrupting air travel, increasing hospital admissions, and extending to portions of Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia. Coal outcrops are so common in Indonesia it is virtually certain these fires ignited new coal-seam fires.

===Norway===
In 1944, Longyearbyen Mine #2 on Svalbard was set alight by sailors from the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; on its final sortie outside of Norwegian coastal waters. The mine continued to burn for 20 years, while some of the areas were subsequently mined from the reconstructed Mine #2b.

=== Poland ===

* Mining disaster at Donnersmarckhütte mine

===South Africa===
* Transvaal and Delagoa Bay Collieries near Emalahleni (formerly known as Witbank), Mpumalanga has been burning since the mine was abandoned in 1953.

===United States===

Many coalfields in the US are subject to spontaneous ignition. The federal Office of Surface Mining (OSM) maintains a database (AMLIS), which in 1999 listed 150 fire zones. In mid-2010, according to OSM, more than 100 fires were burning beneath nine states, most of them in Colorado, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Utah and West Virginia. Some geologists say that many fires go unreported, so that the actual number of them may be nearer to 200, across 21 states.

In Pennsylvania, 45 fire zones are known, the most famous being the Centralia mine fire in the Centralia mine in the hard coal region of Columbia County, which has been burning since 1962. Burning Mine, near Summit Hill, caught fire in 1859.

In Colorado, coal fires have arisen as a consequence of fluctuations in the groundwater level, which can increase the temperature of the coal up to 300 °C, enough to cause it to spontaneously ignite.

The Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana contains some 800 billion tons of brown coal, and the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804 to 1806) reported fires there. Fires have been a natural occurrence in this area for about three million years and have shaped the landscape. For example, an area about 4,000 square kilometres in size is covered with coal clinker, some of it in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, where there is a spectacular view of fiery red coal clinker from Scoria Point.

== In popular culture ==

The novel &quot;Germinal&quot; by the French novelist &quot;Emile Zola&quot; describes a fictional coal fire called &quot;Le Tartaret&quot;.

The 1991 film &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot;, directed and co-written by Dan Aykroyd, features a town, Valkenvania, that has an underground coal fire that has been burning for decades. The judge of the town references the constantly burning coal-mine fire as the source of his hatred of financiers.

In the TV show &quot;Scorpion&quot;, Season 3, Episode 23, the Scorpion team extinguishes an underground coal fire in Wyoming.

The novel &quot;Fire in the Earth (地火)&quot; by Chinese author Liu Cixin focuses on the theme of underground coal fires, exploring their causes and consequences within a fictional narrative.

<doc id="952216" wikidata="Q3206303" url="?curid=952216" title="Bootleg mining">
<text>Bootleg mining or shoemaker mining is a form of illegal coal mining.

The term originated around the 1920s, though the practice probably predates that. Generally, a bootleg mine (sometimes called a bootleg pit) is a small mine dug by a handful of men. Often this took place surreptitiously on land owned by somebody else, such as a coal company. They were frequently dug by coal miners off official tunnels in order to procure additional, free coal for themselves, a practice that causes additional ramifications when fighting mine fires. Sometimes small pits are hidden under houses or outbuildings. Usually, the mine is not large enough to turn around in. The pits are known for being unsafe, and often causing collapse.

The practice has died away in the United States; an American with simple equipment cannot dig enough coal in a day to reach a living wage. Bootleg mines in China are still very common, as are the fatalities resulting from unregulated mining.

==In Pennsylvania==
Shortly before the Great Depression, Pennsylvania&#x27;s anthracite industry collapsed, shutting down collieries and throwing tens of thousands of miners out of work. Unemployed miners dug their own coalholes, often on company property, and began setting up bootleg breakers and trucking operations, creating an entire bootleg coal industry. According to a 1938 report commissioned by Governor George Howard Earle, there were as many as 1,965 bootleg holes, operated by over 7,000 bootleg miners, producing 2,400,000 tons of coal per year. By 1941, miners and police clashed over the dynamiting of their coalholes.

==In Poland==

Bootleg mines were most frequently created in Upper Silesia during the economic crisis of 1929–1933, and were often the only source of income for entire families. Coal from bootleg mines was cheaper than coal sold by regular mines, which led to the destruction of bootleg mines by blowing them up and the police chasing illegal miners.

A resurgence of bootleg mining occurred in 1990s in Lower Silesia around the city of Wałbrzych, after all coal mines in the city were closed. The previously predominantly mining town was facing high unemployment rates and underlying coal deposits which surface as outcrops near the city are relatively easily accessible for bootleg mining. Due to the non-compliance with health and safety regulations and work performed by unqualified people, it is a very dangerous activity resulting in numerous accidents, including fatalities.

<text>Lox is a fillet of brined salmon, which may be smoked. Lox is frequently served on a bagel with cream cheese, and often garnished with tomato, onion, cucumber, and capers.

==Etymology==
The American English word &quot;lox&quot; is a borrowing of Yiddish (), itself derived from Middle High German (modern German form: ) stemming from Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot; and ultimately Proto-Indo-European (PIE) &quot;*laks&quot;. &quot;Lax&quot;, chiefly a British English word for salmon, is a doublet of the word inherited from Middle English. The word has various cognates in various Indo-European languages. For example, cured salmon in Scandinavian countries is known by different versions of the name gravlax or gravad laks, with &quot;lax&quot; meaning salmon. The word is so remarkably widespread and stable across IE languages that it probably existed in its current form in the PIE language itself. This wide distribution of the term was in the past used by linguists to argue for a placement of the PIE Urheimat in the watershed of the Baltic Sea before more modern linguistics determined that the original term likely referred to a different species of fish. This line of argument – called the Lachsargument – was common especially in German-speaking linguistics for almost a century.

==Preparation==
The traditional belly lox is known as such because it is made from the fatty fish belly. The cut is described as &quot;paper-thin&quot;. Traditionally, the product is unsmoked and preserved by dry curing, leading to a very salty taste. As a result of consumer preferences, mass-produced &quot;lox&quot; generally use less salt and add cold smoke, making them more similar to a &quot;Nova&quot; (see below). A different cut may be used, too, in these versions.

A Nova or Nova Scotia salmon, sometimes called Nova lox, is cured with a milder brine and then cold-smoked. The cut remains thin, making it a middle ground between the old belly lox and regular smoked salmon. The name dates from a time when much of the salmon in New York City came from Nova Scotia. Today, however, the name only refers to the style of preparation and has no bearing on the source of the fish: they may come from other waters or even be raised on farms.

== Similar dishes == 
The following salmon dishes are almost never considered a &quot;lox&quot; in the bagel context, as a thicker cut is used.

* Scotch or Scottish-style salmon. A rub of salt and sometimes sugars, spices, and other flavorings is applied directly to the meat of the fish; this is called &quot;dry-brining&quot; or &quot;Scottish-style.&quot; The brine mixture is then rinsed off, and the fish is cold-smoked. 
* Gravad lax (laks) or gravlax. The traditional Nordic means of preparing salmon, coating with or immersing the fish in a rub of dill, sugar, and salt and dry-curing it. The seasoning mixture may also variously include juniper berry, fennel, allspice or coriander. It is often served with a sweet mustard-dill sauce.

Other similar brined and smoked fish products include chubs, sable, smoked sturgeon, smoked whitefish, and kippered herring. These delicacies are popular in delis and gourmet stores, particularly in Northeastern US cities that received significant Jewish, Eastern European and Russian immigration, such as New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.

<text>Puiseux is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that has been almost completely submerged by lava. It is located near the southern end of Mare Humorum, to the north east of the ruined crater Doppelmayer. To the south-southeast is Vitello. 

Of the original structure of Puiseux, only the upper part of the rim remains above the mare surface. There are some small craters within the interior floor, and a low hill is at the center.

It was named by the IAU in 1935 after French astronomer Pierre Puiseux.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Puiseux.

<doc id="952230" wikidata="Q2227505" url="?curid=952230" title="Black triangle (UFO)">
<text>Black triangles are UFOs reported as having a triangular shape and dark color, typically observed at night, described as large, silent, hovering, moving slowly, and displaying pulsating, colored lights which they can turn off.

==British sightings and UK Ministry of Defence Report==

A declassified report from the UK Ministry of Defence, addressing Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) within the UK Air Defence Region and code named Project Condign, includes analyses of black triangle sightings. The report includes the statement that &quot;the majority, if not all, of the hitherto unexplained reports may well be due to atmospheric gaseous electrically charged buoyant plasmas&quot; that are &quot;capable of being transported at enormous speeds under the influence and balance of electrical charges in the atmosphere.&quot; The report also notes that &quot;at least some&quot; of the black triangle observations likely arise from meteor entry into the atmosphere. 

Regarding the triangular shapes, the report also states: &quot;Occasionally ... it seems that a field with, as yet, undetermined characteristics, can exist between certain charged buoyant objects in loose formation, such that, depending on the viewing aspect, the intervening space between them forms an area (viewed as a shape, often triangular) from which the reflection of light does not occur. This is a key finding in the attribution of what have frequently been reported as black &#x27;craft,&#x27; often triangular and even up to hundreds of feet in length.&quot; A recommendation in the report is that no attempt be made on the part of aircraft to intercept or outmaneuver these objects, and instead to place them astern to mitigate the risk of collision. The report also speculates that the hypothesized plasma formations, through their &quot;magnetic, electric or electromagnetic&quot; fields, could have the potential to induce in observers vivid, but mainly incorrect, perceptions. 

The Project Condign report was not peer-reviewed, and some authors doubt its scientific veracity.

==Other sightings==
===1980s Hudson Valley sightings===
During the early 1980s, several hundred people claimed to have witnessed UFOs flying over, or near to, the Hudson River in New York state. These sightings involved hovering or slowly flying V-shaped objects rimmed with colorful lights. Several pilots claimed responsibility for these UFOs, reporting that the objects, some tracked to a local airport and parking lot, were ultralight aircraft flown in formation.

===1989–1992 Belgian wave===
The Belgian UFO wave began in November 1989. The events of 29 November were documented by over thirty different groups of witnesses and three separate groups of police officers. All of the reports related to a large object flying at a low altitude. The craft was flat and triangular, with lights underneath. This giant craft did not make a sound as it slowly moved across the landscape of Belgium.

&quot;The Belgian UFO Wave of 1989–1992 – A Neglected Hypothesis&quot; discusses some sightings that helicopters can explain. Most witnesses reported that the objects were silent. This report argues that the lack of noise could be due to the engine noise in the witnesses&#x27; automobiles or the strong natural wind blowing away from the witnesses.

Black triangle UFOs have been claimed to be visible to radar. During the 1989–1990 Belgian UFO wave, two Belgian Air Force F-16s attempted to intercept an object detected by radar, but the pilots did not report seeing an object. This entire Belgian UFO wave, however, has been disputed by skeptics.

===1997 Phoenix Lights incident===

A widely reported appearance(s) of black triangles involved the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; events, during which multiple unidentified objects were observed near Phoenix, Arizona and videotaped by both the local media and residents beginning on Thursday, March 13, 1997. Some observed objects/lights appeared to be grouped in a large &quot;V&quot; formation that lingered for several minutes. Some residents reported one of the black triangles to be over a mile wide and that it drifted slowly over their houses, blocking out the night sky&#x27;s stars.

An official report from the US Air Force concluded that the military had been locally testing aircraft-launched flares during that period.

===2000 Southern Illinois incident===
The &quot;St. Clair Triangle&quot;, &quot;UFO Over Illinois&quot;, &quot;Southern Illinois UFO&quot;, or &quot;Highland, Illinois UFO&quot; sighting occurred on January 5, 2000 over the towns of Highland, Dupo, Lebanon, Shiloh, Summerfield, Millstadt, and O&#x27;Fallon, Illinois, beginning shortly after 4:00 am. The incident was featured in several television shows including , a Discovery Channel special &quot;UFOs Over Illinois&quot;, and an episode of the Syfy series &quot;Proof Positive&quot;. Sufjan Stevens included this incident in the song &quot;Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois&quot; from his 2005 album &quot;Illinois&quot;. The FAA said sighting reports may have been due to an advertising blimp operated in the area by the American Blimp Company.

===2004–2006 Tinley Park Lights===
Three red lights hovered in a triangular formation were seen by multiple witnesses in Tinley Park and Oak Forest, Illinois, on August 21, 2004, two months later on October 31, 2004, again on October 1, 2005, and once again on October 31, 2006. Some witnesses photographed the lights and captured them on video. According to some ufologists, the video evidence suggests that the lights kept the geometrical shape and moved as if they were attached through a dark object. The incident was examined in a &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; episode on May 18, 2008, and in the episode &quot;Invasion Illinois&quot; of the television series &quot;UFO Hunters&quot; premiered on The History Channel on October 29, 2008.

===2008 Stephenville, Texas===
Around 8 January 2008, there was a mass sighting in Stephenville, Texas. In the 2023 Netflix documentary series &quot;Encounters&quot;, it is claimed that there were black triangles and inside were what looked like insects or a praying mantis.

==Military aircraft==
Classified military aircraft may be responsible for many black triangle UFO reports. Several such sightings have been reported over Antelope Valley, an area of desert in southern California. This stretch of desert draws people interested in potential &quot;black project&quot; aircraft because it is close to several known military research and testing areas, such as Edwards Air Force Base in California and United States Air Force Plant 42. A geographic analysis by the now-inactive National Institute for Discovery Science suggested that black triangles might be U.S. Air Force craft.

At least some of the proposed military types may be fictitious. The Northrop TR-3A Black Manta is a speculative surveillance aircraft purported to belong to the United States Air Force and to have been developed under a black project. It was said to be a subsonic stealth spy plane with a flying wing design. It was alleged to have been used in the Gulf War to provide laser designation for Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk bombers, for targeting to use with laser-guided bombs (since the F-117 possesses a laser designator, the reason for both aircraft being utilized is unclear). There is little evidence to support the TR-3&#x27;s existence; however, it is possible that black triangle UFO reports associated with Black Manta could be a technology demonstrator for a potential new-generation tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and/or that TR-3 refers to a Technical Refresh of an existing program.

Geoscientist Ben McGee has identified border patrol drones with infrared anti-collision or identification lights to explain some black triangles.

<doc id="952231" wikidata="Q8004782" url="?curid=952231" title="William B. Cushing">
<text>William Barker Cushing (4 November 184217 December 1874) was an officer in the United States Navy, best known for sinking the during a daring nighttime raid on 27 October 1864, for which he received the Thanks of Congress. Cushing was the younger brother of Medal of Honor recipient Alonzo Cushing. As a result, the Cushing family is the only family in American history to have a member buried at more than one of the United States Service Academies.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Cushing was born in Delafield, Wisconsin, and was the youngest of four brothers and had two sisters. After the death of his father when he was still a young child, the family relocated to Fredonia, New York. He was expelled from the United States Naval Academy, just before graduation, for pranks and poor scholarship. In particular, he received a failing grade in Spanish after drawing a picture of the Spanish professor biting a horse. The Spanish professor was offended because, in actuality, the horse had bitten him. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, however, he pleaded his case to United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles himself, was reinstated and went on to acquire a distinguished record, frequently volunteering for the most hazardous missions. &quot;His heroism, good luck and coolness under fire were legendary.&quot;

===Civil War===
Cushing saw action during the Battle of Hampton Roads and at Fort Fisher, among many others. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1862, and to commander in 1872. Two of his brothers died in uniform, Alonzo H. Cushing in the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor, and Howard B. Cushing, while fighting the Chiricahua Apaches in 1871. His eldest brother, Milton, served in the Navy as a paymaster.
It was Cushing&#x27;s daring plan and its successful execution against the Confederacy&#x27;s ironclad ram that defined his military career. The powerful ironclad dominated the Roanoke River and the approaches to Plymouth through the summer of 1864. By autumn, the U.S. government decided that the situation should be studied to determine if something could be done. The U.S. Navy considered various ways to destroy &quot;Albemarle&quot;, including two plans submitted by Lieutenant Cushing. They finally approved one of his plans and authorized him to locate two small steam launches that might be fitted with spar torpedoes.

Cushing discovered two picket boats under construction in New York and acquired them for his mission. On each he mounted a 12-pound Dahlgren howitzer and a spar projecting into the water from its bow. One of the boats was lost at sea during the voyage from New York to Norfolk, Virginia, but the other arrived safely with its crew of seven officers and men at the mouth of the Roanoke. There, the steam launch&#x27;s spar was fitted with a lanyard-detonated torpedo.
On the night of 27–28 October 1864, Cushing and his men began working their way upriver. A small cutter accompanied them, its crew having the task of preventing interference by the Confederate sentries stationed on a schooner anchored to the wreck of the . When both boats, under the cover of darkness, slipped past the schooner undetected, Cushing decided to use all 22 of his men and the element of surprise to capture &quot;Albemarle&quot;.

As they approached the Confederate docks, their luck turned and even though under the cover of darkness they were spotted by a guard dog. They came under heavy sentry fire from both the shore and aboard &quot;Albemarle&quot;. As they closed with &quot;Albemarle&quot;, they quickly discovered she was defended against approach by floating log booms. The logs, however, had been in the water for many months and were covered with heavy slime. The steam launch rode up and then over them without difficulty. When her spar was fully against the ironclad&#x27;s hull, Cushing stood up in the bow and detonated the torpedo&#x27;s explosive charge.
The explosion threw everyone aboard the steam launch into the water. Recovering quickly, Cushing stripped off his uniform and swam to shore, where he hid until daylight. That afternoon, having avoided detection by Confederate search parties, he stole a small skiff and quietly paddled down-river to rejoin the Union forces at the river&#x27;s mouth. Of the other men in Cushing&#x27;s boat, William Houghtman escaped, John Woodman and Richard Higgins were drowned, and 11 were captured.

Cushing&#x27;s daring commando raid blew a hole in &quot;Albemarle&quot;″s hull at the waterline &quot;big enough to drive a wagon in.&quot; She sank immediately in the six feet of water below her keel, settling into the heavy bottom mud, leaving the upper armored casemate mostly dry and the ironclad&#x27;s large Stainless Banner battle ensign flying from its flag staff, where it was eventually captured as a Union prize.

Both of Cushing’s brothers were killed in combat. His oldest brother, Alonzo Cushing died at the battle of Gettysburg during Picket’s Charge. Howard Cushing died in 1871 fighting the Apaches. William Baker Cushing died 17 December 1874, possibly due to injuries he sustained and/or suffered from the Albemarle sound mission.

===After the American Civil War===
After the American Civil War, Cushing served in both the Pacific and Asiatic Squadrons; he was the executive officer of the and commanded the . He also served as ordnance officer in the Boston Navy Yard.

Before taking command of USS &quot;Maumee,&quot; while he was on leave at home in Fredonia, Cushing met his sister&#x27;s friend, Katherine Louise Forbes. &#x27;Kate&#x27;, as she was known, would sit and listen for hours to William&#x27;s stories of adventure. Cushing asked her to marry him on 1 July 1867. Unfortunately, he received orders and was gone before a ceremony could take place. On 22 February 1870, Cushing and Forbes married. Their first daughter, Marie Louise, was born on 1 December 1871.
On 31 January 1872, he was promoted to the rank of commander, becoming the youngest up to that time to attain that rank in the Navy. Two weeks later he was detached to await orders. Weeks of waiting turned into months, but no word came. He had given up hope of another sea command, when early in June 1873, Cushing had an offer to take command of . He took command of his new ship on 11 July 1873.

He commanded &quot;Wyoming&quot; with his typical flair for being where the action was, performing daring and courageous acts. &quot;Wyoming&quot;″s boilers broke down twice, and in April she was ordered to Norfolk for extensive repairs. On 24 April, Cushing was detached and put on a waiting list for reassignment. He believed that he would be given &quot;Wyoming&quot; again when she was ready for duty, but in truth, his ill-health would not permit him to command another vessel.

Cushing returned to Fredonia to see his new daughter, Katherine Abell, who had been born on 11 October 1873. His wife was shocked to see the condition of her husband. His health was in apparent decline. Kate remarked to William&#x27;s mother that he looked to be a man of sixty instead of his thirty-one years. Cushing had begun having severe attacks of pain in his hip as early as just after the sinking of the &quot;Albemarle.&quot;

None of the medical doctors he saw were able to make a diagnosis. The term &quot;sciatica&quot; was used in those days without regard to cause for any inflammation of the sciatic nerve, or any pain in the region of the hip. Cushing may have had a ruptured intervertebral disc. He had suffered enough shocks to dislocate half a dozen vertebrae, and with the passage of time they came to bear more and more heavily upon the nerve. On the other hand, he may have been suffering from tuberculosis of the hip bone, or cancer of the prostate gland. There was nothing to be done and Cushing continued to suffer.

He was given the post of executive officer of the Washington Navy Yard. He spent the summer of 1874 pretending to be happy with his inactive role. He played with his children and enjoyed their company. On 25 August, he was made senior aide at the yard; in the fall he amused himself by taking an active interest in the upcoming congressional elections.

On Thanksgiving Day, William, Kate and his mother went to church in the morning. That night, the pain in Cushing&#x27;s back was worse than it had ever been and he could not sleep. The following Monday he dragged himself to the Navy Yard. Kate sent Lieutenant Hutchins, once of the &quot;Wyoming&quot; crew and now Cushing&#x27;s aide, to bring his superior home. She feared that he wouldn&#x27;t last the day. True to his nature, Cushing stayed at the yard until after nightfall, and went right to bed when he got home. He would not rise again. The pain was constant and terrible. He was given injections of morphine, but that only dulled the pain a little.

On 8 December, it became impossible to care for Cushing at home, and he was removed to St. Elizabeths Hospital. His family visited him often, but he seldom recognized them. Cushing died on 17 December 1874, in the presence of his wife and mother. He was buried on 8 January 1875, at Bluff Point, at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis.

==Legacy==

Cushing&#x27;s grave is marked by a large, monumental casket made of marble, on which in relief, are Cushing&#x27;s hat, sword, and coat. On one side of the stone the word &quot;Albemarle&quot; is cut and on the other side, &quot;Fort Fisher&quot;.

Five ships in the U.S. Navy have been named after him. The most recent one, the , was decommissioned in September 2005.

Cushing has a portrait of him in full dress uniform hanging in Memorial Hall at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Nearly all of the other portraits in the hall are of admirals. A monument that honors Alonzo, William, and Howard Cushing is located at Cushing Memorial Park in Delafield, Wisconsin.

<doc id="952238" wikidata="Q3953603" url="?curid=952238" title="Season of the Sakura">
<text>is a Japanese bishōjo eroge for MS-DOS. It was translated to English in 1996 by JAST USA, and re-released for modern Windows systems in 2002 as part of the &quot;JAST USA Memorial Pack&quot;. It is widely regarded as one of their best early games. This popularity can be attributed to the game&#x27;s strong characters, evocative setting, and high replay value: each of the girls has her own personality and story, and in some cases it is difficult to make the correct choices to get together with a particular girl.

The game contains some thinly veiled references to several popular anime series, including &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; and &quot;Saint Tail&quot;: each of the female characters bears a striking resemblance in appearance and (in most cases) personality to a girl from one of these anime.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Shuji Yamagami, a Japanese high school student, over the course of a Japanese school year from April to March. The game is played by reading through text and selecting actions for Shuji to perform. The actions are chosen by combining a verb and a target from a menu, so a typical set of options to choose from might consist of LOOK -&gt; (at the) ROOM, LOOK -&gt; (at) REIKO, THINK -&gt; (about) REIKO, TALK -&gt; (to) MAKOTO, TALK -&gt; (to) REIKO.

==Plot==
Shuji meets eight girls over the course of the year, any of whom can end up as his girlfriend – if the player makes the right decisions. The setting and scenes are romantic: the game skips over the drudgery of school life and focuses on holidays and time spent with his friends, as he gradually falls in love with one of the girls.

==Characters==
Shuji Yamagami
:The main character whose actions the player controls. While he apparently succeeds at virtually everything he tries, he is clueless about girls. He is also completely unable to swim and is terrified of the ocean.

Reiko Sawamura
:Two years older than the main character. A kind-hearted girl and strong swimmer. Looks like Umi Ryuzaki from &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;.

Kiyomi Shinfuji
:A classmate of Shuji&#x27;s. Academically gifted and a little shy. Looks like Fuu Hououji from &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;.

Mio Suzuki
:A bright and active girl in Shuji&#x27;s year who loves tennis. Looks like Hikaru Shidou from &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;.

Ruri Shiromizu
:A very introverted and quiet girl who transfers into Shuji&#x27;s class. She initially refuses to smile or even talk to anyone. Looks like Rei Ayanami from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

Aki Hinagiku
:A loud and aggressive girl in Mio&#x27;s class. She is Mio&#x27;s rival in tennis and looks like Asuka Langley from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

Seia Yoshida
:A gentle and kind girl in Shuji&#x27;s class who is a strong Catholic. Looks like Seira Mimori from &quot;Saint Tail&quot;.

Meimi Nakano
:A stubborn argumentative girl in Shuji&#x27;s class. Cares little about school because she plans to join her mother&#x27;s circus troupe. Looks like Meimi Haneoka from &quot;Saint Tail&quot;.

Shoko Nishino
:A shallow girl in Reiko&#x27;s class who likes football. Looks like Shoko Inaba from &quot;Welcome to Pia Carrot&quot;, another dating sim.

Kyoko Kobayashi
:The homeroom teacher of Shuji&#x27;s class. Easy-going and informal, she sometimes meets up with her students socially. Looks like Misato Katsuragi from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

Makoto Shimazaki
:Shuji&#x27;s best friend, a boy who loves playing at anything military. Looks like Kensuke Aida from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

==Development and release history==

The characters&#x27; ages were altered as part of the process of translation from Japanese to English. The main male character and most of the girls were originally sixteen and in the first year of high school, with only the two characters in third year being age 18. However, in order to avoid controversy over the sex scenes involving these girls who were younger than the American age of consent, JAST changed the ages to 18 for first years and 20 for the third years, claiming that the game&#x27;s Kotobuki Preparatory School was a special institution for students who&#x27;d finished school. In spite of the translation efforts, the first interactive selection prompts the following text: &quot;I&#x27;m Shuji Yamagami, sixteen years old.&quot;

<doc id="952240" wikidata="Q108442504" url="?curid=952240" title="Murder of Holly Jones">
<text>Holly Maria Jones (September 14, 1992 – May 12, 2003) was a 10-year-old child abduction and murder victim from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On May 12, 2003, while walking a friend home, she was kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and strangled by Michael Briere. After dismembering her body, Briere attempted to discard the remains by placing them in two bags and used weights to try to sink them in the Toronto Harbour. The bags were found the next morning.

Briere pleaded guilty to the crime, receiving an automatic life sentence and will not be eligible to apply for parole until 2028.

==Background==
Holly Maria Jones was born on September 14, 1992, to parents Maria Jones and George Stonehouse. She had three older siblings: Shauna, Natasha and James. Jones attended St. Luigi Catholic Elementary School in the Junction Triangle neighborhood at the time of the murder. Holly was a lively, gentle, and energetic girl with a big imagination and even bigger dreams. 

She aspired to be a famous singer because she loved music. Holly excelled in school and was a well-liked student and athlete, playing basketball and running cross-country.

== Disappearance, discovery and investigation ==

On May 12, 2003, Jones disappeared after walking a friend home in Toronto&#x27;s west-end neighbourhood; along her route was Briere&#x27;s house. Hours after her disappearance, she was reported missing, prompting a large-scale police search and an Amber Alert.

Jones&#x27; remains were discovered in two duffel bags on the shores of Toronto Island on May 13, 2003. The area surrounding Jones&#x27; neighbourhood would see multiple attempted child abductions in the weeks following the murder and heightened police presence in the area. During a wide-scale request for samples from all men in the area where Jones had gone missing, Briere was initially suspected by police for refusing to provide a DNA sample. Police put Briere under surveillance, and obtained a DNA sample by testing his saliva on a soda can he disposed of in a public trash can. Carpet fibres from the green carpet of his apartment were matched to fibres found on Jones&#x27; remains. He was arrested and charged with her murder on June 20, 2003.

== Arrest and conviction ==
Michael Briere, a 35 year-old software developer, was charged with the murder at his west-end residence, near Jones&#x27; home. On June 17, 2004, Briere pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Holly Jones. In court, he attributed his actions to viewing child pornography, going on to describe his crime as &quot;cruel, inhuman, and nightmarish&quot;, stating he wished to spare his victim&#x27;s family the pain of a trial. He received an automatic life sentence and will not be eligible to apply for parole until 2028.

<doc id="952246" wikidata="Q2561040" url="?curid=952246" title="Canadian National Vimy Memorial">
<text>The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is a war memorial site in France dedicated to the memory of Canadian Expeditionary Force members killed during the First World War. It also serves as the place of commemoration for Canadian soldiers of the First World War killed or presumed dead in France who have no known grave. The monument is the centrepiece of a preserved battlefield park that encompasses a portion of the ground over which the Canadian Corps made their assault during the initial Battle of Vimy Ridge offensive of the Battle of Arras.

The Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first time all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, and it became a Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada the perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters, and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.

The project took designer Walter Seymour Allward eleven years to build. King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including 6,200 attendees from Canada. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. The site is maintained by Veterans Affairs Canada. The Vimy Memorial is one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside the country, the other being the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial.

==Background==

===Topography===
Vimy Ridge is a gradually rising escarpment on the western edge of the Douai Plains, northeast of Arras. The ridge gradually rises on its western side, dropping more quickly on the eastern side. The ridge is approximately in length, wide at its narrowest point, and culminates at an elevation of above sea level, or above the Douai Plains, providing a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions.

===Vimy Ridge 1914–1916===
The ridge fell under German control in October 1914, during the Race to the Sea, as the Franco-British and German forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. During the attack, the French 1st Moroccan Division briefly captured the height of the ridge, where the Vimy memorial is currently located, but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the top of the ridge. The French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.

The British XVII Corps relieved the French Tenth Army from the sector in February 1916. On 21 May 1916, the German infantry conducted the German attack on Vimy Ridge along a front to force them from positions along the base of the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions. Temporary Lieutenant Richard Jones was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his ultimately unsuccessful defence of the Broadmarsh Crater during the attack. British counter-attacks on 22 May did not manage to change the situation. The Canadian Corps relieved IV Corps stationed along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge in October 1916.

===Battle of Vimy Ridge===
The Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first instance in which all four Canadian divisions participated in a battle together, as a cohesive formation. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions already in place. The 24th British Division of I Corps supported the Canadian Corps along its northern flank while the XVII Corps did so to the south. The ad hoc formation, based under I Bavarian Reserve Corps commander Karl Ritter von Fasbender, was the principal defending formation with three divisions responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps.
The attack began at 5:30 am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. Light field guns laid down a barrage that advanced in predetermined increments, often every three minutes, while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages against known defensive systems further ahead. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions quickly captured their first objectives. The 4th Canadian Division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions captured their second objective by approximately 7:30 am. The failure of the 4th Canadian Division to capture the top of the ridge delayed further advances and forced the 3rd Canadian Division to expend resources establishing a defensive line to its north. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division renewed the attack on the German positions on the top of the ridge and eventually forced the German troops holding the southwestern portion of Hill 145 to withdraw.

On the morning of 10 April, Canadian Corps commander Lieutenant-General Julian Byng moved up three fresh brigades to support the continued advance. The fresh units leapfrogged units already in place and captured the third objective line, including Hill 135 and the town of Thélus, by 11:00 am. By 2:00 pm both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reported capturing their final objectives. By this point the &quot;Pimple&quot;, a heavily defended knoll west of the town of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, was the only German position remaining on Vimy Ridge. On 12 April, the 10th Canadian Brigade attacked and quickly overcame the hastily entrenched German troops, with the support of artillery and the 24th British Division. By nightfall on 12 April, the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge. The Canadian Corps suffered 10,602 casualties: 3,598 killed and 7,004 wounded. The German Sixth Army suffered an unknown number of casualties, and around 4,000 men became prisoners of war.

Although the battle is not generally considered Canada&#x27;s greatest military feat of arms, the image of national unity and achievement imbued the battle with considerable national significance for Canada. According to Pierce, &quot;the historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada&#x27;s coming of age as a nation.&quot; The idea that Canada&#x27;s identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of Canada.
==History==

===Selection===
In 1920, the Government of Canada announced that the Imperial War Graves Commission had awarded Canada eight sites—five in France and three in Belgium—on which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement, and the Canadian government initially decided that each battlefield be treated equally and commemorated with identical monuments. In September 1920, the Canadian government formed the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission to discuss the process and conditions for holding a memorial competition for the sites in Europe. The commission held its first meeting on 26 November 1920 and during this meeting decided that the architectural design competition would be open to all Canadian architects, designers, sculptors, and artists. The jury consisted of Charles Herbert Reilly representing the Royal Institute of British Architects, Paul Philippe Cret representing the Société centrale des architectes français and Frank Darling representing the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. Each jury member was a leader in the architectural field; Reilly was training students in design and development of war memorials, and Cret had been selected by the United States to design national monuments in Europe. Interested parties submitted 160 design drawings, and the jury selected 17 submissions for consideration, commissioning each finalist to produce a plaster maquette of their respective design. The jury recommended in a 10 September 1921 report to the commission that two of the designs be executed. In October 1921, the commission formally selected the submission of Toronto sculptor and designer Walter Seymour Allward as the winner of the competition; the design submitted by Frederick Chapman Clemesha was selected as runner-up. Allward&#x27;s other commissions included the national memorial commemorating Canada&#x27;s participation in the South African War (1899–1902). The complexity of Allward&#x27;s design precluded the possibility of duplicating the design at each site. The approach of selecting one primary memorial ran counter to the recommendation of Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission architectural advisor Percy Erskine Nobbs, who had consistently expressed his preference for a series of smaller monuments. The consensus went in Allward&#x27;s favour, his design receiving both public and critical approval. The commission revised its initial plans and decided to build two distinctive memorials—those of Allward and Clemesha—and six smaller identical memorials.
At the outset, members of the commission debated where to build Allward&#x27;s winning design. The jury&#x27;s assessment was that Allward&#x27;s submission was best suited to a &quot;low hill rather than to a continuous and lofty bluff or cliff like Vimy Ridge&quot;. The commission committee initially recommended placing the monument in Belgium on Hill 62, near the location of the Battle of Mont Sorrel, as the site provided an imposing view. This ran counter to the desires of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King who, while speaking in the House of Commons of Canada in May 1922, argued in favour of placing the memorial at Vimy Ridge. King&#x27;s position received the unanimous support of the House and, in the end, the commission selected Vimy Ridge as the preferred site. The government announced its desire to acquire a more considerable tract of land along the ridge after the commission selected Vimy Ridge as the preferred location for Allward&#x27;s design. In the interval between the 1st and 2nd session of the 14th Canadian Parliament, Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada Rodolphe Lemieux went to France to negotiate the acquisition of more land. On 5 December 1922, Lemieux concluded an agreement with France in which France granted Canada &quot;freely and for all time&quot; the use of of land on Vimy Ridge, inclusive of Hill 145, in recognition of Canada&#x27;s war effort. The only condition placed on the donation was that Canada use the land to erect a monument commemorating Canadian soldiers killed during the First World War and assume the responsibility for the maintenance of the memorial and the surrounding battlefield park.

===Memorial construction===
Following the competition, Allward spent the remainder of 1921 and the spring of 1922 preparing for his move to Europe. After selling his home and studio, Allward finally departed for Belgium on 6 June 1922 and spent several months seeking a suitable studio in Belgium and then Paris, though he eventually set up a studio in London.

Allward had initially hoped to use white marble for the memorial&#x27;s facing stone, but Percy Nobbs suggested this would be a mistake because marble was unlikely to weather well in northern France and the memorial would have a &quot;ghost like&quot; appearance. Allward undertook a tour of almost two years to find stone of the right colour, texture, and luminosity. He found it in the ruins of Diocletian&#x27;s Palace at Split, Croatia; he observed that the palace had not weathered over the years, which Allward took as evidence of the stone&#x27;s durability. His choice—Seget limestone—came from an ancient Roman quarry near Seget, Croatia. The difficulties with the quarrying process, coupled with complicated transportation logistics, delayed delivery of the limestone and thus construction of the memorial. The first shipment did not arrive at the site until 1927, and the larger blocks, intended for the human figures, did not begin to arrive until 1931.

On Allward&#x27;s urging the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission hired Oscar Faber, a Danish structural engineer, in 1924 to prepare foundation plans and provide general supervision of the foundation work. Faber had recently designed the substructure for the Menin Gate at Ypres, and he selected a design that employed cast-in-place reinforced concrete to which the facing stone would be bonded. Major Unwin Simson served as the principal Canadian engineer during the construction of the memorial and oversaw much of the daily operations at the site. Allward moved to Paris in 1925 to supervise the construction and the carving of the sculptures. Construction commenced in 1925 and took eleven years to complete. The Imperial War Graves Commission concurrently employed French and British veterans to carry out the necessary roadwork and site landscaping.

While awaiting the first delivery of stone, Simson noticed that the battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve a portion of the battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.
Allward chose a relatively new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now on display at the Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave was not part of the original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.
===Pilgrimage and unveiling===
In 1919, the year after the war ended, around 60,000 British tourists and mourners made pilgrimages to the Western Front. The transatlantic voyage was longer and more expensive from Canada; many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed, and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small, unofficial groups. The delegates of the 1928 national convention of the Canadian Legion passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to the Western Front battlefields. A plan began to take form wherein the Legion aimed to coordinate the pilgrimage with the unveiling of the Vimy memorial, which at the time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932. Due to construction delays with the memorial, it was not until July 1934 that the Canadian Legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with the unveiling of the memorial. Although the exact date of the memorial unveiling was still not set, the Legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in Ottawa. The response from veterans and their families was enthusiastic—1,200 inquiries by November 1934. The Legion presumptuously announced that the memorial would be unveiled on Dominion Day, 1 July 1936, even though the government still did not know when it would be completed.

For event planning purposes, the Legion and the government established areas for which each was responsible. The government was responsible for the selection of the official delegation and the program for the official unveiling of the memorial. The Legion was responsible for the more challenging task of organizing the pilgrimage. For the Legion, this included planning meals, accommodations and transportation for what was at the time the largest single peacetime movement of people from Canada to Europe. The Legion took the position that the pilgrimage would be funded by its members without subsidies or financial aid from Canadian taxpayers, and by early 1935 they had established that the price of the 3½-week trip, inclusive of all meals, accommodation, health insurance, and sea and land transportation would be per person ($ as of 2016). Indirect assistance came in several forms. The government waived passport fees and made a special Vimy passport available to pilgrims at no extra cost. The government and private sector also provided paid leave for their participating employees. It was not until April 1936 that the government was prepared to publicly commit to an unveiling date, 26 July 1936. On 16 July, the five transatlantic liners, escorted by and , departed the Port of Montreal with approximately 6,200 passengers and arrived in Le Havre on 24 and 25 July. The limited accommodation made it necessary for the Legion to lodge pilgrims in nine cities throughout northern France and Belgium and employ 235 buses to move the pilgrims between various locations.

On 26 July, the day of the ceremony, pilgrims spent the morning and early afternoon exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS &quot;Saguenay&quot; provided the guard of honour. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the Second Battle of Artois. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission over shortwave radio, with facilities of the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President Albert Lebrun and Prince Arthur of Connaught, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, was absent because, as he had not served in the war and had treated Lord Byng fairly harshly during the 1926 King-Byng Affair. He was also reluctant to meet veterans and felt that a war veteran in Cabinet should attend in his place. On the day, four government ministers and four Canadian Army General officers attended the unveiling.

Before the ceremony began, Edward VIII, present in his capacity as King of Canada, inspected the guard of honour, was introduced to the honoured guests, and spent approximately half an hour speaking with veterans in the crowd. Two Royal Air Force and two French Air Force squadrons flew over the monument and dipped their wings in salute. The ceremony itself began with prayers from chaplains representing the Church of England, the United Church of Canada, and the Roman Catholic Church. Ernest Lapointe, Canadian Minister of Justice, spoke first, followed by Edward VIII who, in both French and English, thanked France for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead. The King then pulled the Royal Union Flag from the central figure of &quot;Canada Bereft&quot; and the military band played the Last Post. The ceremony was one of the King&#x27;s few official duties before he abdicated the throne. The pilgrimage continued, and most participants toured Ypres before being taken to London to be hosted by the British Legion. One-third of the pilgrims left from London for Canada on 1 August, while the majority returned to France as guests of the government for another week of touring before going home.

===Second World War===
In 1939, the increased threat of conflict with Nazi Germany amplified the Canadian government&#x27;s level of concern for the general safety of the memorial. Canada could do little more than protect the sculptures and the bases of the pylons with sandbags and await developments. When war did break out in September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) deployed to France and assumed responsibility for the Arras sector, which included Vimy. In late May 1940, following the British retreat to Dunkirk after the Battle of Arras, the status and condition of the memorial became unknown to Allied forces. The Germans took control of the site and held the site&#x27;s caretaker, George Stubbs, in an Ilag internment camp for Allied civilians in St. Denis, France. The rumoured destruction of the Vimy Memorial, either during the fighting or at the hands of the Germans, was widely reported in Canada and the United Kingdom. The rumours led the German Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to formally deny accusations that Germany had damaged or desecrated the memorial. To demonstrate the memorial had not been desecrated, Adolf Hitler, who reportedly admired the memorial for its peaceful nature, was photographed by the press while personally touring it and the preserved trenches on 2 June 1940. The undamaged state of the memorial was not confirmed until September 1944 when British troops of the 2nd Battalion, the Welsh Guards of the Guards Armoured Division, recaptured Vimy Ridge.

===Post-war years===
Immediately following the Second World War, very little attention was paid to the Battle of Vimy Ridge or the Vimy Memorial. The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Legionary&quot;, the magazine of the Royal Canadian Legion, were the only publications to note the 35th anniversary of the battle in 1952. The 40th anniversary in 1957 received even less notice, with only the &quot;Halifax Herald&quot; making any mention. Interest in commemoration remained low in the early 1960s but increased in 1967 with the 50th anniversary of the battle, paired with the Canadian Centennial. A heavily attended ceremony at the memorial in April 1967 was broadcast live on television. Commemoration of the battle decreased once again throughout the 1970s and only returned in force with the 125th anniversary of Canadian Confederation and the widely covered 75th anniversary of the battle in 1992. The 1992 ceremony at the memorial was attended by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and at least 5,000 people. Subsequent smaller-scale ceremonies were held at the memorial in 1997 and 2002.

===Restoration and rededication===
By the end of the century, the many repairs undertaken since the memorial&#x27;s construction had left a patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major  million restoration project to restore Canada&#x27;s memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.

Time, wear, and severe weather conditions led to many identified problems, the single most pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed to take into account how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project was intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward&#x27;s initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.
Queen Elizabeth II, escorted by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, rededicated the restored memorial on 9 April 2007 in a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. Other senior Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and senior French representatives, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin among them, attended the event, along with thousands of Canadian students, veterans of the Second World War and of more recent conflicts, and descendants of those who fought at Vimy. The crowd attending the rededication ceremony was the largest crowd on the site since the 1936 dedication.

===Centennial commemoration===
The centennial commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge took place at the memorial on 9 April 2017, coincidentally during the Canadian sesquicentennial celebrations. Estimates before the event indicated that an audience of up to 30,000 would be present. The Mayor of Arras, Frédéric Leturque, thanked Canadians, along with Australians, Britons, New Zealanders and South Africans, for their role in the First World War battles in the area.

Attending dignitaries for Canada included Governor General David Johnston; Prince Charles; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; Prince Harry; and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. President François Hollande and Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve represented France. Elizabeth II issued a statement via the Governor General, remarking &quot;[Canadians] fought courageously and with great ingenuity in winning the strategic high point of Vimy Ridge, though victory came at a heavy cost&quot;.

Two postage stamps were released jointly by Canada Post and France&#x27;s La Poste featuring the memorial, one designed by each country, to commemorate the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge.

==Site==

The Canadian National Vimy Memorial site is approximately north of Arras, France, circled by the small towns and communes of Vimy to the east, Givenchy-en-Gohelle to the north, Souchez to the northwest, Neuville-Saint-Vaast to the south and Thélus to the southeast. The site is one of the few places on the former Western Front where a visitor can see the trench lines of a First World War battlefield and the related terrain in a preserved natural state. The total area of the site is , much of which is forested and off limits to visitors to ensure public safety. The site&#x27;s rough terrain and buried unexploded munitions make the task of grass cutting too dangerous for human operators. Instead, sheep graze the open meadows of the site.

The site was established to honour the memory of the Canadian Corps, but it also contains other memorials. These are dedicated to the French Moroccan Division, Lions Club International, and Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins. There are also two Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries on site: Canadian Cemetery No. 2 and Givenchy Road Canadian Cemetery. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours, the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The site&#x27;s interpretive centre helps visitors fully understand the Vimy Memorial, the preserved battlefield park, and the history of the Battle of Vimy within the context of Canada&#x27;s participation in the First World War. The Canadian National Vimy Memorial and Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial sites comprise close to 80 percent of conserved First World War battlefields in existence and between them receive over one million visitors each year.

===Vimy memorial===

Allward constructed the memorial on the vantage point of Hill 145, the highest point on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There is a group of figures at each end of the front wall, next to the base of the steps. The &quot;Breaking of the Sword&quot; is at the southern corner of the front wall while &quot;Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless&quot; is at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are &quot;The Defenders&quot; and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In &quot;Breaking of the Sword&quot;, three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In &quot;Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless&quot;, one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada&#x27;s sympathy for the weak and oppressed.

The figure of a cloaked young woman stands on top and at the centre of the front wall and overlooks the Douai Plains. She has her head bowed, her eyes cast down, and her chin resting in one hand. Below her at ground level is a sarcophagus, bearing a Brodie helmet and a sword, and draped in laurel branches. The saddened figure of &quot;Canada Bereft&quot;, also known as &quot;Mother Canada&quot;, is a national personification of the young nation of Canada, mourning her dead. The statue, a reference to traditional images of the and presented in a similar style to that of Michelangelo&#x27;s Pietà, faces eastward looking out to the dawn of the new day. Unlike the other statues on the monument, stonemasons carved &quot;Canada Bereft&quot; from a single 30 tonne block of stone. The statue is the largest single piece in the monument and serves as a focal point. The area in front of the memorial was turned into a grassed space, which Allward referred to as the amphitheatre, that fanned out from the monument&#x27;s front wall for a distance of while the battle-damaged landscape around the sides and back of the monument were left untouched.
The twin pylons rise to a height 30 metres above the memorial&#x27;s stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and sacrifice of the two countries. At the top of the pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the &quot;Chorus&quot;. The most senior figures represent &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Peace&quot;; &quot;Peace&quot; stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward&#x27;s previously commissioned statues of &quot;Truth&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot;, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the &quot;Chorus&quot; is located directly below the senior figures: &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Truth&quot; on the eastern pylon; and &quot;Honour&quot;, &quot;Charity&quot; and &quot;Knowledge&quot; on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada&#x27;s war dead in both French and English are at the base of the pylons. The &quot;Spirit of Sacrifice&quot; is at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.

The Mourning Parents, one male and one female figure, are reclining on either side of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.

===Moroccan Division Memorial===

The Moroccan Division Memorial is dedicated to the memory of the French and Foreign members of the Moroccan Division, killed during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915. The monument was raised by veterans of the division and inaugurated on 14 June 1925, having been built without planning permission. Excluding the various commemorative plaques at the bottom front facade of the memorial, campaign battles are inscribed on the left- and right-hand side corner view of the memorial. The veterans of the division later funded the April 1987 installation of a marble plaque that identified the Moroccan Division as the only division where all subordinate units had been awarded the Legion of Honour.

The Moroccan Division was initially raised as the Marching Division of Morocco. The division comprised units of varying origins and although the name would indicate otherwise, it did not in fact contain any units originating from Morocco. Moroccans were part of the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion which was formed from the merger of the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment with the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment, both also part of the Moroccan Division Brigades. The division contained Tirailleurs and Zouaves, of principally Tunisian and Algerian origin, and most notably Legionnaires from the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment and the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment. The French Legionnaires came, as attested to by a plaque installed on the memorial, from 52 different countries and included amongst them American, Polish, Russian, Italian, Greek, German, Czechoslovakian, Swedish, Armenian, various nationals of the Jewish faith (http://monumentsmorts.univ-lille3.fr/monument/2892/givenchyengohelle-autre/), and Swiss volunteers such as writer Blaise Cendrars.

In the battle, General Victor d&#x27;Urbal, commander of the French Tenth Army, sought to dislodge the Germans from the region by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. When the attack began on 9 May 1915, the French XXXIII Army Corps made significant territorial gains. The Moroccan Division, which was part of the XXXIII Army Corps, quickly moved through the German defences and advanced into German lines in two hours. The division managed to capture the height of the ridge, with small parties even reaching the far side of the ridge, before retreating due to a lack of reinforcements. Even after German counter-attacks, the division managed to hold a territorial gain of . The division did however suffer heavy casualties. Those killed in the battle and commemorated on the memorial include both of the division&#x27;s brigade commanders, Colonels Gaston Cros and Louis Augustus Theodore Pein.

===Grange Subway===
The First World War&#x27;s Western Front included an extensive system of tunnels, subways, and dugouts. The Grange Subway is a tunnel system that is approximately in length and once connected the reserve lines to the front line. This permitted soldiers to advance to the front quickly, securely, and unseen. A portion of this tunnel system is open to the public through regular guided tours provided by Canadian student guides.

The Arras-Vimy sector was conducive to tunnel excavation owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. As a result, pronounced underground warfare had been a feature of the Vimy sector since 1915. In preparation for the Battle of Vimy Ridge, five British tunnelling companies excavated 12 subways along the Canadian Corps&#x27; front, the longest of which was in length. The tunnellers excavated the subways at a depth of 10 metres to ensure protection from large calibre howitzer shellfire. The subways were often dug at a pace of four metres a day and were often two metres tall and one metre wide. This underground network often incorporated or included concealed light rail lines, hospitals, command posts, water reservoirs, ammunition stores, mortar and machine gun posts, and communication centres.

===Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins memorial===
Near the Canadian side of the restored trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive ordnance disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system on the grounds of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.

===Visitors&#x27; centre===

The site has a visitors&#x27; centre, staffed by Canadian student guides, which is open seven days a week. During the memorial restoration, the original visitors&#x27; centre near the monument was closed and replaced with a temporary one, which remains in use today. The visitors&#x27; centre is now near the preserved forward trench lines, close to many of the craters created by underground mining during the war and near the entrance of the Grange Subway. Construction of a new educational visitors&#x27; centre is expected to be completed by April 2017, in advance of the 100th anniversary of the battle. The new million visitor centre is a public-private partnership between government and the Vimy Foundation. In order to raise funds the Vimy Foundation granted naming rights in various halls of the visitor centre to sponsors, an approach which has met some level of controversy due to the site being a memorial park.

==Sociocultural influence==

The Canadian National Vimy Memorial site has considerable sociocultural significance for Canada. The idea that Canada&#x27;s national identity and nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of Canada. Historian Denise Thomson suggests that the construction of the Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period. Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War, while expressing the enormous impact of war in general, and also considers that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation&#x27;s determination to remember Canada&#x27;s contribution and sacrifice during the First World War.

The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized the importance of the site by recommending its designation as one of the National Historic Sites of Canada; it was so designated in 1996, and is one of only two outside of Canada. The other is the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, also in France. Remembrance has also taken other forms: the Vimy Foundation, having been established to preserve and promote Canada&#x27;s First World War legacy as symbolized by the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, and Vimy Ridge Day, to commemorate the deaths and casualties during the battle. Local Vimy resident Georges Devloo spent 13 years until his death in 2009 offering car rides to Canadian tourists to and from the memorial at no charge, as a way of paying tribute to the Canadians who fought at Vimy.

The memorial is not without its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures at the top of the pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.
The memorial is regularly the subject or inspiration of other artistic projects. In 1931, Will Longstaff painted &quot;Ghosts of Vimy Ridge&quot;, depicting ghosts of men from the Canadian Corps on Vimy Ridge surrounding the memorial, though the memorial was still several years away from completion. The memorial has been the subject of stamps in both France and Canada, including a French series in 1936 and a Canadian series on the 50th anniversary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The Canadian &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; was selected from a cemetery in the vicinity of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and the design of the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is based upon the stone sarcophagus at the base of the Vimy memorial. The Never Forgotten National Memorial was intended to be a statue inspired by the &quot;Canada Bereft&quot; statue on the memorial, before the project was cancelled in February 2016.

A 2001 Canadian historical novel &quot;The Stone Carvers&quot; by Jane Urquhart involves the characters in the design and creation of the memorial. In 2007, the memorial was a short-listed selection for the Seven Wonders of Canada. The Royal Canadian Mint released commemorative coins featuring the memorial on several occasions, including a 5 cent sterling silver coin in 2002 and a 30 dollar sterling silver coin in 2007. The Sacrifice Medal, a Canadian military decoration created in 2008, features the image of &quot;Mother Canada&quot; on the reverse side of the medal. A permanent bas relief sculpted image of the memorial is presented in the gallery of the grand hall of the Embassy of France in Canada to symbolize the close relations between the two countries. The memorial is featured on the reverse of the Frontier Series Canadian polymer $20 banknote, which was released by the Bank of Canada on 7 November 2012.

<text>Seeliger is a relatively small lunar impact crater that lies near the southeastern edge of Sinus Medii. It was named after the German astronomer Hugo von Seeliger. This is a circular, cup-shaped feature that has not been appreciably worn by impact erosion. To the southeast is a rille named the Rima Réaumur, following a line to the northwest. In the north is the 110-km-long Rima Oppolzer, which divides the mare where Seeliger is situated from the remainder of the Sinus Medii.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Seeliger.

<text>Alexander Paul Weaver (born 3 January 1981) is an English actor, writer and part-time director, best known for his role as curate Leonard Finch in the ITV series &quot;Grantchester&quot; (2014-present).

==Background==
Weaver was born in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester, England. He went to Rivington and Blackrod High School and studied acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

==Career==
Weaver&#x27;s first paid theatre role was in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s 2004 production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, at the Old Vic theatre in London. Weaver played the title role on Monday evenings and at all matinees, whilst Ben Whishaw took on the role for evening performances, from Tuesday to Saturday.

British politician Michael Portillo lauded Weaver&#x27;s interpretation of Hamlet in &quot;The New Statesman&quot;: &quot;He [Weaver] gave meaning to the poetry, refusing to be rushed in the soliloquies or intimidated by them, varying volume and pace well. Frame by frame, he made credible Hamlet&#x27;s progression from self-indulgence to nobility, so we could nearly believe Fortinbras&#x27; remark that &#x27;he was likely, had he been put on,/To have proved most royally&#x27;.&quot;

Weaver has appeared in minor roles in films such as &quot;Colour Me Kubrick&quot; (2005) (uncredited), &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (2004), &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), and &quot;Unmade Beds&quot; (2009); &quot;Me and Orson Welles&quot; (2009 film). he also played &quot;The Kid&quot; in &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Schwob&quot; in &quot;Colette&quot;, and an uncredited Gulf War soldier in &quot;Armistice&quot; (2014).

His television credits include D.C. Billy Slaven in &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot; (episodes &quot;In Pursuit of a Proper Sinner&quot; and &quot;A Cry for Justice&quot;) and National Antiquities Museum employee Andy Galbraith in &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;The Blind Banker&quot;. Weaver has been in &quot;Five Days&quot; (TV miniseries) as Josh Fairley. He has also been in &quot;Five Daughters&quot; (TV miniseries) played Tom Alderton. Weaver also has been in &quot;Secret State&quot; as Josh Leyton. Weaver also appeared in &quot;Southcliffe&quot; (TV miniseries), where he played Anthony. Weaver was in &quot;Life in Squares&quot; (TV miniseries) and played Young Leonard Woolf. He was also in &quot;The Smoke&quot; where he played Tom. Weaver was in &quot;The Nativity&quot;, in which he played Thomas. Weaver was in &quot;Personal Affairs&quot; playing Crawford Crawford.

His theatre credits include Meshak in the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s 2006-07 production of Helen Edmundson&#x27;s &quot;Coram Boy&quot;.

Weaver plays fledgling Anglican curate Leonard Finch in the TV series &quot;Grantchester&quot; (since 2014), who assists the Vicar of Grantchester, Sidney Chambers, and later, Will Davenport.

Radio credits include &quot;&quot;, a 2017 biographical radio play by the English writer James Runcie. Weaver also presents radio shows at a pub called the Boogaloo based in north London. One is called Film And Telly Stuff, which he presents with actor Luke Neal and the other is called The Theme&#x27;s Of Our Youth, which he presents with actor Jack Whitam.

In September 2017, the BBC announced he had joined the cast of the mini-series &quot;PRESS&quot;.

Weaver is also known for his role as protagonist Rex in the game &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;, released in December 2017. He reprised the role for the character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, as well as the trailer revealing Pyra and Mythra as playable characters.

In 2019, a fourth series of &quot;Grantchester&quot; aired, with Weaver reprising his role as Leonard Finch.

In 2020, Weaver starred in a choose-your-own-adventure style sci-fi thriller video game &quot;The Complex&quot; as Dr. Rees Wakefield.

<text>Crop insurance is insurance purchased by agricultural producers and subsidized by a country&#x27;s government to protect against either the loss of their crops due to natural disasters, such as hail, drought, and floods (&quot;crop-yield insurance&quot;), or the loss of revenue due to declines in the prices of agricultural commodities (&quot;crop-revenue insurance&quot;).

==United States==

In the United States, the federal government subsidizes an average of 62 percent of the premium. In 2019, crop insurance policies covered almost 380 million acres. Major crops are insurable in most counties where they are grown, and about 90% of U.S. crop acreage is insured under the federal crop insurance program. Four crops—corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat—typically account for more than 70% of total enrolled acres. For these major crops, a large share of plantings is covered by crop insurance.

In the United States, a subsidized multi-peril federal insurance program, administered by the Risk Management Agency, is available to most farmers. The program is authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (which is actually title V of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, P.L. 75-430), as amended. Federal crop insurance is available for more than 100 different crops, although not all insurable crops are covered in every county. With the amendments to the Federal Crop Insurance Act made by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-354, Title I) and the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-224), USDA is authorized to offer basically free catastrophic (CAT) coverage to producers who grow an insurable crop. For a premium, farmers can buy additional coverage beyond the CAT level. Crops for which insurance is not available are protected under the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP). Federal crop insurance is sold and serviced through private insurance companies. A portion of the premium, as well as the administrative and operating expenses of the private companies, is subsidized by the federal government. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation reinsures the companies by absorbing some of the losses of the program when indemnities exceed total premiums. Several revenue insurance products are available on major crops as a form of additional coverage.

=== History of crop insurance in the U.S. ===
In 1938, Congress passed the Federal Crop Insurance Act, which established the first Federal Crop Insurance Program. These early efforts were not particularly successful due to
high program costs and low participation rates among farmers. The program had difficulty amassing sufficient reserves to pay claims and was not financially viable.

In 1980, Congress passed legislation to increase participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program and make it more affordable and accessible. This modern era of crop insurance was marked by the introduction of a public-private partnership between the U.S. government and private insurance companies.

The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 dramatically restructured the program. And in 1996, the Risk Management Agency (RMA) was created in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to administer the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Through subsidies built into the new program guidelines, participation increased dramatically. By 1998, more than 180 million acres of farmland were insured under the program, representing a three-fold increase over 1988.

In 2019, farmers purchased 1.1 million crop insurance policies, protecting almost 380 million acres of farmland, with new liabilities in excess of $110 billion. These policies covered roughly 90 percent of eligible acres. Record indemnities were paid out to farmers and ranchers in 2012, totaling more than $17 billion.

Today, the Federal Crop Insurance Program is the primary risk management program available to U.S. agricultural producers and a vital component of the farm safety net, addressing both the risks associated with price volatility and with unexpected disasters. 

Crop insurance is a risk-based program that currently covers more than 100 crops and does not make annual subsidy payments to farmers. When crop insurance does supply monetary payments to farmers, the payments come in the form of indemnity checks that restore a portion of an actual loss. Many farmers pay crop insurance premium costs for a number of years without receiving indemnity payments because they have not experienced an actual loss. 

*Crop-yield insurance: There are two main classes of crop-yield insurance:
**Crop-hail insurance is generally available from private insurers (in countries with private sectors) because hail is a narrow peril that occurs in a limited place and its accumulated losses tend not to overwhelm the capital reserves of private insurers. In early 1820s, crop-hail insurance were available to farmers in France and Germany. That is among the earliest forms of hail insurance from an actuarial perspective. It is possible to implement the hail risk into financial instruments since the risk is isolated.
**Multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI): Coverage in this type of insurance is not limited to just one risk. Usually multi-peril crop insurance offers hail, excessive rain and drought in a combined package. Sometimes, additional risks such as insect or bacteria-related diseases are also offered. The problem with the multi-peril crop insurance is the possibility of a large-scale event. Such an event can cause significant losses beyond the insurer&#x27;s financial capacity. To make this class of insurance, the perils are often bundled together in a single policy, called a multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI) policy. MPCI coverage is usually offered by a government insurer and premiums are usually partially subsidized by the government. U.S. Department of Agriculture is known to implement the earliest multi-peril crop insurance program in 1938. Federal Crop Insurance Corporation managed this multi-peril insurance program since then. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) is active in calculating the premiums based on individual risk factors since 1996.
*Crop-revenue insurance: Crop-yield times the crop price gives the crop-revenues. Based on farmer&#x27;s revenues, crop-revenue insurance is based on deviation from the mean revenue. RMA uses the futures prices on harvest-times listed in the commodity exchange markets, to determine the prices. Combining the future price with farmer&#x27;s average production gives the estimated revenue of the farmer. Accessing the futures market offers enables revenue protection even before the crop planted. There is a single guarantee for a certain number of dollars. The policy pays an indemnity if the combination of the actual yield and the cash settlement price in the futures market is less than the guarantee. In the United States, the program is called Crop Revenue Coverage. Crop-revenue insurance covers the decline in price that occurs during the crop&#x27;s growing season. It does not cover declines that may occur from one growing season to another.

=== Specialty crops ===
A farmer or grower may desire to grow a crop associated with a particular defined attribute that potentially qualifies for a premium over similar commodity crops, agricultural products, or derivatives thereof. The particular attribute may be associated with the genetic composition of the crop, certain management practices of the grower, or both. However, many standard crop insurance policies do not differentiate between commodity crops and crops associated with particular attributes. Accordingly, farmers have a need for crop insurance to cover the risk of growing crops associated with particular attributes.

== Canada ==

In Canada, the history of CI (Crop Insurance) begins in 1939 with the introduction of the Prairie Farm Assistance Act by the Canadian Government. This act provided permanent crop loss disaster assistance for grain producers in the Prairies and the Peace River area. In 1959, the CI Act was passed to replace the Prairie Farm Assistance Act and provide more adequate protection to farmers in all provinces. CI has been a key federal support program since 1959 aimed at helping to stabilize farm incomes against production related risks. The reason governments got involved in CI was because the market failed to provide risk management tools for farmers to deal appropriately with production risk. CI has varied little over the years in that it was designed on the basis of participation by both levels of government (federal and provincial) and producers, shared program costs, voluntary participation, provincial administration, and actuarial soundness in the long run.
The CI Act of 1959 enabled the federal government to assist provinces in making CI available to producers at a 60% coverage level. Originally the federal government&#x27;s share of total premiums was 20%, with a 50% share of administrative expenses. In 1964, the Act was amended to incorporate general provisions for a reinsurance agreement between the provinces and the federal government. Further amendments were made in 1966 and 1970 concerning coverage levels and the federal government contribution to total premiums. The next amendment to the Act, in 1973, provided two options for the federal-provincial-producer cost-sharing arrangements. In one option, the federal and provincial governments each contributed 25% of total premiums and 50% of administrative costs. In the other option, the federal government contributed a total of 50% of premiums and the provinces paid all administrative costs. In the 1990 amendment, the maximum coverage was increased to 90% for low risk crops. Furthermore, the single cost-sharing formula was adopted, where the federal government and provinces each pay 25% of total premiums and 50% of administration costs. Other changes included waterfowl crop damage compensation, and regulations concerning self-sustainability and actuarial soundness requirements.

Although federal legislation establishes the national framework, much flexibility exists for provinces to modify the program to meet the needs of their producers. Provincial plans are developed through consultations with all three parties on a commodity basis. CI is available in all provinces for a wide variety of crops but coverage is not universal, nor are participation rates necessarily high although the cost of the program is subsidized by government. AAFC allocates approximately $200 million per year to CI from its total safety net envelope of $600 million. In 1996–97 it is estimated that the federal government&#x27;s expenditures reached $207 million compared to an average of $166 million over the three previous years (AAFC 1997b). Provincial governments spent $251 million in 1996-97 which compares to an average of $175 million over the previous three crop years. By far the largest component of the program covers grain and oilseed production on the Prairies, but even here participation has fallen below 60% of seeded area.

== India ==
In India a multiperil crop insurance called National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS) was implemented. This scheme is being implemented by Agriculture Insurance Company of India, an Indian government owned company. The scheme is compulsory for all farmers who take agricultural loans from any financial institution. It is voluntary for all other farmers. The premium is subsidized for farmers who own less than two hectares of land. This insurance follows the area approach. This means that instead of individual farmers, a specific area is insured. The area may vary from gram panchayat (an administrative unit containing 8–10 villages) or block or district from crop to crop or state to state. The claim is calculated on the basis of crop cutting experiments carried out by agricultural departments of respective states. Any shortfall in yield compared to the prior five years&#x27; average yield is compensated.

When it comes to India, there are three major crop insurance schemes that a farmer should consider buying. They are as follows:

* National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS)
* Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (MNAIS)
* Weather Based Crop Insurance (WBCI)

<text>Theiler is a tiny lunar impact crater on the eastern lunar limb, in the western Mare Marginis. To the southeast is the prominent walled plain Neper. Due to its location, Theiler is not always visible to observers on the Earth because of the effects of the Moon&#x27;s libration. Theiler is a circular, bowl-shaped formation of no particular significance.

<text>Winthrop is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that has been flooded by lava from the Oceanus Procellarum. It was named after American astronomer John Winthrop. It lies across the western rim of the much larger crater Letronne, a feature that has been nearly destroyed by the intruding mare lavas. All that survives of Winthrop are a few segments of the outer rim.

Winthrop was previously identified as Letronne P before being renamed by the IAU in 1976.

<doc id="952276" wikidata="Q5367595" url="?curid=952276" title="Elsie Jane Wilson">
<text>Elsie Jane Wilson (7 November 1885 – 16 January 1965) was a cinema actress, director, and writer during the early film era. She took part in the productions of the silent film era and starred in over thirty films. Between the years of 1916 and 1919, Wilson was credited for producing, writing two films, and directing eleven films. She was best known in the genres of dramas and comedy dramas.

==Biography==
Elsie Jane Wilson was born in Sydney, Australia. She began her career as a professional actress at the age of two. She credited her success to participating in the &quot;English Christmas Pantomime&quot; every year, allowing her to gain training and experience for the pictures. 

Wilson acted in London, South Africa, and New York City. She toured Australia and New Zealand with a number of J. C. Williamson companies, where she met and married Rupert Julian in 1906. They immigrated to New York, United States in 1913 and eventually found work as actors in Hollywood under Joseph de Grasse.

== Film career ==
Wilson and Rupert moved to Los Angeles in 1914 to pursue Universal Studios’ Rex Company. She briefly worked with The Little Theatre before she went into the movies. Wilson starred in films that were directed, produced and co-starred by her husband, Rupert Julian. She mentioned that her and Julian appeared in everything together until they came to the US. They started working on different movies and she even adds that when she was starring in “Everywomen” she went without seeing her husband for two years. The industry turned to directing, with Wilson later functioning as Julian&#x27;s co-director. Though she received little credibility for her work and often was out-shined by Julian. Wilson notes that she and her husband had different ideas while sharing the appreciation for the same pictures, making it difficult for them to discuss work.

Wilson took a break from Universal and starred in films from other studios including American Studios. She appeared in Oliver Twist (1916) and other Paramount movies, then in 1917 returned to Universal and started her producer/directorial career, mainly in light comedies. It was noted in &quot;The Pittsburg Press&quot; in 1916 that her supportive role in &quot;Temptation&quot; was a &quot;pronounced success&quot;. She started her solo director career in 1917 with her film “The Little Pirate” which released on September 10, 1917.

According to the reviews of the day, Wilson was a modest filmmaker, being best appreciated for eliciting good performances from otherwise indifferent talent. Her work was seen as artistic, enjoyable and popular in the film industry. Wilson featured as many female roles in her films and tended to appeal to child and female audiences. When writer Frances Denton of &quot;Photoplay&quot; visited Universal Studios in 1918, she described the work that Wilson was creating as “sob stuff” and was noticed as one of the female directors at Universal that created films centering around children. “The Game’s Up”, released in 1919, marked the end of Wilson&#x27;s career.

== Universal in the 1910s ==

Historians noted Universal Studios for their feminist politics. Elsie Jane Wilson&#x27;s case exemplifies how genre and gender, up until 1918,worked together to establish the institution&#x27;s division of labor. Work and genres became gendered because the institution thought of gender in a particular manner. During this time, Universal was more hierarchal than collaborative. Moving Picture World began to identify such films as “woman’s features”, including Wilson&#x27;s solo-directed films, separating “women” from the word “director”. This begins to exclude the women from the director&#x27;s chair.

== Contribution to cinema ==
Early press established her as “front rank” of directors. Nevertheless, few women directors sustained careers in the 1910s. Actors on Julian&#x27;s pictures later commented on how she came to set every day, often lightening the mood with jokes at Julian&#x27;s expense to relieve tension.

In 1917, Wilson began advertising in &quot;The Weekly&quot; for members to take part in a café scene for her film &quot;“The Game’s Up”&quot;. During the same time period, the Board of Health shut down many Los Angeles restaurants due to an influenza epidemic leaving cabaret showgirls out of work. Wilson and Universal was addressed with a mob of showgirls trying to take part in her film.

In February 1918, Frances Denton wrote a story for &quot;Photoplay&quot; that addressed the normative femininity subordinate women in the name of equality. Denton presented Wilson as being a role model for the social standing of women.

Moving Pictures World, a weekly film industry periodical, often published on Wilson and her efforts in the silent film era. The Moving Picture Weekly recorded Wilson as Bluebird&#x27;s noted woman producer. Her work played upon gender roles. In one of the films directed by Wilson, &quot;The Dream Lady&quot; (1918), the plot highlights gender visibility and insisting that gender is a performance.

== Death ==
Wilson survived her husband, who died in 1943. Wilson died in Los Angeles, California, at age 79, and was buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California alongside her husband. Much of Wilson&#x27;s personal work has been destroyed over the century though her efforts have not gone unnoticed by the “Women Film Pioneers Project” and various other cinematic references from the times.

<text>An inverse parser, as its name suggests, is a parser that works in reverse. Rather than the user typing into the computer, the computer presents a list of words fitting the context, and excludes words that would be unreasonable. This ensures the user knows all of their options. The concept and an implementation were originally developed and patented by Texas Instruments. A few years later, it was independently developed by Chris Crawford, a game designer, for his game, Trust &amp; Betrayal: The Legacy of Siboot, but the implementation was different enough not to infringe on the patent.

<text>Nestor George Chylak Jr. (; May 11, 1922 – February 17, 1982) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American League from 1954 to 1978. He umpired in three ALCS (1969, 1972, 1973), serving as crew chief in 1969 and 1973. He also called five World Series (1957, 1960, 1966, 1971, 1977), serving as the crew chief in 1971 (in which he worked home plate in the decisive Game 7) and 1977. He also worked in six All-Star Games: 1957, 1960 (both games), 1964, 1973 and 1978, working home plate in the second 1960 game and in 1973.

==Early life==
Chylak was born in Olyphant, Pennsylvania. His parents, Nestor Sr. and Nellie, were of Ukrainian descent; Chylak was the first of their five children. He attended the University of Scranton, where he studied engineering.

During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army in Europe. He suffered shrapnel injuries in Battle of the Bulge, which blinded him for several days and hospitalized him for eight weeks. He earned both the Silver Star and Purple Heart during his service. After the war, he began umpiring amateur baseball in 1946, and returned briefly to college.

==Career==
After a year in amateur baseball, Chylak moved into the minor leagues as a Pennsylvania-Ontario-New York League umpire. He spent several more minor league seasons in the Canadian–American League, the New England League, and the Eastern League. He debuted in the major leagues in 1954.

Chylak said that two of his greatest thrills occurred in the early to mid-1960s. The first occurred in the 1960 World Series: he was umpiring when Bill Mazeroski of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit the home run that allowed the Pirates to defeat the New York Yankees. His second was during the 1966 World Series; he was the umpire during what turned out to be Sandy Koufax&#x27;s final game, before his retirement a few weeks later.

Chylak worked the first American League Championship Series in 1969. On June 4, 1974, he was on the field in Cleveland for &quot;Ten Cent Beer Night&quot;. The Cleveland Indians had been struggling with low attendance figures, resulting in this promotion that attracted more than 25,000 fans to the game. Fans became unruly and incited fights with the players, sometimes pouring beer on them. Chylak declared the game a forfeit after he sustained a facial wound from being hit with a chair.

He was the home plate umpire for the first major league game played by the Toronto Blue Jays in 1977 during a snowstorm at Exhibition Stadium against the Chicago White Sox.

After retiring from the field in 1978, he became an assistant league supervisor of umpires. Chylak was in the umpire&#x27;s dressing room at Comiskey Park on Disco Demolition Night, a July 12, 1979, doubleheader between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox. Between the games of the doubleheader, unruly fans rioted. Because of damage to the field, the umpires refused to allow the second game to be played. When American League president Lee MacPhail decided the White Sox must forfeit the second game, Chylak was the one who informed White Sox owner Bill Veeck.

According to family, his most memorable game was umpiring the 1960 World Series when, on October 13, Bill Mazeroski hit a home run off reliever Ralph Terry at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. This was the only homer to end a World Series game 7 in major league history.

With a total of 31 career ejections, he was also credited with never throwing Baltimore manager Earl Weaver out of a game.

==Retirement==
Following his retirement, he became a member of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Speakers&#x27; Bureau and addressed a wide variety of groups, &quot;talking about the intangible lessons he learned during his years in baseball&quot;. Chylak died in his sleep on February 17, 1982, at age 59 in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, and was survived by his wife Sue, his sons Robert and William, and three siblings.

==Legacy==
Upon his death, Bowie Kuhn said that &quot;few have ever been more respected in his field than Mr. Chylak.&quot; AL president Lee MacPhail said, &quot;He was considered an outstanding teacher and certainly one of the finest umpires in major league baseball in modern times. We are sure he will be a candidate for eventual Hall of Fame recognition... Baseball has lost a wonderful friend and a great umpire.&quot; He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1999.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Chylak as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

<text>Cargill, Incorporated is an American multinational food corporation based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, and incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware.
Founded in 1865 by William Wallace Cargill, it is the largest privately held company in the United States in terms of revenue. 

Some of Cargill&#x27;s major businesses are trading, purchasing and distributing grain and other agricultural commodities, such as palm oil; trading in energy, steel and transport; raising livestock and production of feed; and producing food ingredients such as starch and glucose syrup, vegetable oils and fats for application in ultra-processed foods and industrial use. Cargill also has a large financial services arm, which manages financial risks in the commodity markets for the company. In 2003, it split off a portion of its financial operations into Black River Asset Management, a hedge fund with about $10 billion of assets and liabilities. It previously owned two-thirds of the shares of The Mosaic Company (sold off in 2011), a producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients.

Cargill reported gross revenues of $165 billion in 2022. It last reported net profit earnings in 2021, of just below $5 billion. Employing over 160,000 employees in 66 countries, it is responsible for 25% of all United States grain exports. The company also supplies about 22% of the United States domestic meat market, importing more products from Argentina than any other company, and is the largest poultry producer in Thailand. All the eggs used in American McDonald&#x27;s restaurants pass through Cargill&#x27;s plants. It is the only US producer of Alberger process salt, which is used in the fast-food and prepared food industries.

Cargill has remained a family-owned business, as the descendants of the founder (from the Cargill and MacMillan families) own over 90% of it. In January 2023, Brian Sikes was appointed as president and CEO, the 10th CEO in Cargill&#x27;s 158-year history.

==History==
===19th century===
Cargill was founded in 1865 by William Wallace Cargill when he bought a grain-flat house in Conover, Iowa. A year later William was joined by his brother Sam, forming W. W. Cargill and Brother. Together, they built grain flat houses and opened a lumberyard. In 1875, Cargill moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, and their brother James joined the business. La Crosse was strategically located on the Mississippi near the junctions of the La Crosse River, Dubuque, and Southern Minnesota divisions of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad.

Sam Cargill left La Crosse in 1887 to manage the office in Minneapolis, an important emerging grain center. Three years later, the Minneapolis operation incorporated as Cargill Elevator Co.; some years after that the La Crosse operation incorporated as W. W. Cargill Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin. In 1898, John H. MacMillan Sr., and his brother, Daniel, began working for W. W. Cargill. MacMillan then married William Cargill&#x27;s eldest daughter, Edna.

===20th century===

Upon Sam Cargill&#x27;s death in 1903, William Cargill became the sole owner of the La Crosse office. John MacMillan was named general manager of Cargill Elevator Company and moved his family to Minneapolis. William Cargill died in 1909, creating a fiscal crisis for the company. MacMillan worked to resolve the credit issues and to force his brother-in-law William S. Cargill out of the company. The current owners are descended from John MacMillan&#x27;s two sons, John H. MacMillan Jr., and Cargill MacMillan Sr., and his youngest brother-in-law, Austen S. Cargill I.

John MacMillan ran the company until his retirement in 1936. Under his leadership Cargill grew several fold, expanding out of the Midwest by opening its first East coast offices, in New York, in 1923. He was also the architect of the company&#x27;s strategy of internationalism. He opened the company&#x27;s first Canadian, European and Latin American offices in 1928, 1929, and 1930. He was also noted for his involvement in the controversial commercial rapprochement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. 

The first of the crises was the debt left by the death of William W. Cargill. The company issued $2.25 million in Gold Notes, backed by Cargill stock, to pay off its creditors. The Gold Notes were due in 1917, but thanks to record grain prices caused by World War I all debts were paid by 1915.

As World War I continued into 1917, Cargill made record earnings and faced criticisms of war profiteering. Four years later, as a fallout from the financial crash of 1920, Cargill posted its first loss.

Cargill opened its first Canadian operations in Montreal in 1928 as Cargill Grain Company Ltd. Headquartered in Winnipeg, it employs up to 8,000 people in Canada.

One of the biggest criticisms of Cargill has been its perceived arrogance (see, for example, Brewster Kneen in the &quot;Ecologist&quot; and also Greg Muttitt in the same journal). The MacMillans&#x27; aggressive management style led to a decades-long feud with the Chicago Board of Trade. It began in 1934 when the Board denied membership to Cargill. The US government overturned the Board&#x27;s ruling and forced it to accept Cargill as a member. The 1936 corn crop failed and with the 1937 crop unavailable until October, the Chicago Board of Trade ordered Cargill to sell some of its corn. Cargill refused to comply.

The US Commodity Exchange Authority and Chicago Board of Trade accused Cargill of trying to corner the corn market. In 1938, the Chicago Board suspended Cargill and three of its officers from the trading floor. When the Board lifted its suspension a few years later, Cargill refused to rejoin, instead trading through independent traders. During World War II, MacMillan Jr. continued to expand the company, which boomed as it stored and transported grain and built T1 tankers and Towboats ships for the United States Navy. In 1962, Cargill rejoined the Chicago Board of Trade, two years after MacMillan&#x27;s death.

In 1960, Erwin Kelm became the first non-family chief executive. Aiming for expansion into downstream production, he led the company into milling, starches, and syrups. As the company grew, it developed a market intelligence network as it coordinated its commodities trading, processing, freight, shipping, and futures businesses. In the decades before email, the company relied on its own telex-based system for internal communication. By 1972, Cargill’s business grew with $5 billion in sales, becoming the largest agricultural trader in the world.
When the Soviet Union entered the grain markets in the 1970s, demand grew to unprecedented levels, and Cargill benefitted. In 1963, Cargill had already negotiated a $40 million wheat deal with the USSR, establishing a relationship that later involved a series of larger deals. When Whitney MacMillan, nephew of John Jr., took over the company from Kelm in 1976, revenue approached $30 billion. The US government put pressure on big grain exporters with allegations of manipulating the market, and Cargill was a major target, but it emerged without any major changes.

In 1978, Cargill purchased the large Leslie Salt refining company in Newark, California, from Schilling.

In 1979, Cargill entered the meat-processing business with the purchase of beef processor MBPXL (later Excel). The division expanded into turkey, food service and food distribution businesses and is now known as Cargill Meat Solutions.

In 1986 Cargill started operations in Venezuela through a partnership with the Possenti family&#x27;s Mimesa C.A. to form Agroindustrial Mimesa in Maracaibo, dedicated to the manufacturing of flour and pasta. Expansion followed thereafter.

Tensions arose with the company&#x27;s private shareholders, as Cargill typically put 80% of earnings back into the business. By the early 1990s, members of the Cargill and MacMillan families became upset that their shares in the company were yielding mediocre dividends. Demands rose for an initial public offering to turn the company public. The company responded with an employee stock ownership plan, and in 1993 reportedly purchased 17% of the firm for $730 million from 72 Cargills and MacMillans. It used that stake to begin the employee stock plan. The company&#x27;s board of directors was reorganized to reduce the number of relatives to six, alongside six independents and five managers.

Ernest Micek took over as chief executive in August 1995. Cargill underwent turmoil in the following years; its financial unit lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 1998 when Russia defaulted on debt and developing countries began to have financial issues. The commodities and ingredients business, which was 75% of Cargill&#x27;s total revenue, suffered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Revenues fell by double-digit percentages for two years in a row, from $55.7 billion in 1997 to $51.4 billion in 1998 and $45.7 billion in 1999, while net income fell from $814 million in 1997 to $468 million in 1998 and $220 million in 1999. By 1999, the company had $4 billion in debt. After a reduction in previously strong bond credit rating, Micek announced he would step down a year early.

===21st century===
In 1998, Warren Staley became chief executive and continued expanding the company and it rebounded. He pursued a new strategy that shifted away from an asset-intensive commodities company to solutions-oriented enterprise. While expanding, the company also refocused its business by selling assets such as its coffee and rubber businesses.

In 2002 Cargill acquired European-based starch manufacturer Cerestar from Montedison for $1.1 billion.

By 2002, Cargill had over $50 billion in annual sales, twice the amount of its closest rival, Archer Daniels Midland, and had 97,000 employees running more than 1,000 production sites in 59 countries.

Cargill Meat Solutions acquired Milwaukee Emmpak in 2003 and merged it with Taylor Packing Co. (purchased in 2001). In 2006, Cargill Meat purchased Fresno Meats. The three main brands of beef are Circle T Beef, Valley Tradition, and Meadowland Farms.

On June 1, 2007, CEO Staley was succeeded by Gregory R. Page.

Cargill&#x27;s quarterly profits exceeded $1 billion for the first time during the quarter ending on February 29, 2008 ($1.03 billion); the 86% rise was credited to global food shortages and the expanding biofuels industry that, in turn, caused a rise in demand for Cargill&#x27;s core areas of agricultural commodities and technology.

In October 2011, the U.S. Justice Department announced that a biotech specialist at Cargill had pleaded guilty to stealing information from Cargill and Dow AgroSciences. Kexue Huang, a Chinese national, was discovered to be passing trade secrets back to China.

In November 2011, Cargill completed the acquisition of Provimi, a global animal nutrition company for €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion US).

On April 1, 2012, Cargill completed a purchase of a cat and dog food plant in Emporia, Kansas. It was previously owned by American Nutrition.

In December 2013 CEO and chairman Page was succeeded by CEO Dave MacLennan.

In December 2014, Cargill finished commissioning a $100 million Indonesian cocoa plant.

In 2015, Cargill wound down its Black River Asset Management division by shutting down four hedge funds, folding two agriculture and energy funds into Cargill, and spinning off three fund businesses to employees to create the hedge fund Proterra Investment Partners, emerging markets debt specialist Argentem Creek Partners and hedge fund Garda Capital Partners.

In 2016, Cargill announced that it would move its Protein Group headquarters from older buildings in downtown Wichita, Kansas, and consolidate into a new building in Wichita&#x27;s nearby Old Town area. The new $60 million building will be built on the site of the building that formerly housed The Wichita Eagle, following the old building&#x27;s demolition.

In 2016, Cargill completed the commissioning of a feed plant in Bathinda, Punjab, India, and manufactures dairy cattle feed under the Purina brand name.

In 2017, Cargill sold its Geneva-based petroleum-trading business to Macquarie Bank and soon after its North American power and gas trading business as well.

In 2018, Cargill and Faccenda Foods opened a joint venture to take over their U.K. fresh poultry businesses, Avara Foods, employing 6,000 people.

In February 2018, Cargill completed the purchase of Pro Pet, a pet food manufacturing company. Pro Pet had three manufacturing facilities, one in Owatonna, Minnesota, one in Kansas City, Kansas, and one in St. Marys, Ohio.

In November 2018, Cargill sold its 13 crop input locations in Ontario, Canada to La Coop Fédérée.

In 2018, Cargill made a $25 million investment in Puris, a supplier of pea protein used in Beyond Meat products. In 2019, Cargill invested an additional $75 million.

====COVID-19 crisis====
On April 8, 2020, Cargill closed its Hazleton, Pennsylvania meatpacking facility because &quot;an unspecified number of Cargill employees at the plant [had] tested positive for COVID-19.&quot; The county had the &quot;highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the area with 982&quot;, of which 849 were in Hazleton.

On April 20, 2020, Cargill temporarily closed its High River, Alberta, plant because &quot;the operation was linked to nearly 500 cases of COVID-19&quot;. All 2,100 employees were recommended for virus testing. This plant was responsible for about 36% of Canada&#x27;s beef producing capacity. On May 6, the plant was connected with 1,560 cases of COVID-19. United Food and Commercial Workers Canada (UFCW) Union Local 401 has recommended the plant&#x27;s closure since 38 cases were known.

The public health authority of Quebec did not shut down a Cargill plant in Chambly south of Montreal on May 10, 2020. A total of 64 employees, about 13% of the workforce, had COVID-19. The workers are represented by the UFCW. The public health department for the Montérégie region had been working with Cargill since April 25 to deal with the outbreak. Cargill closed the plant on its own.

On May 11, a CBC journalist wrote, &quot;The Cargill plant in Alberta, where there have been about 1,000 reported cases [of human COVID-19], is now considered the largest single-site outbreak in North America.&quot; Meanwhile, the Agriculture Union of CFIA&#x27;s embedded inspectors at slaughterhouses said that management is &quot;threatening disciplinary action against employees who refuse to be reassigned to work at COVID-19-infected meat plants&quot;, while Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland said, &quot;those who feel unsafe won&#x27;t be forced back to work.&quot;

Also on May 11, the Alberta government disclosed that a second worker from the Cargill plant there had died that day.

On June 3, 2020, Cargill announced that it would no longer publish quarterly results, stopping the disclosures that the company had provided since 1996. Cargill canceled its third-quarter earnings release in March 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, Cargill announced it would build a corn syrup refinery in Fort Dodge, Iowa.

====New strategy====
In 2022, Cargill saw record profits due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and rising food prices. In January 2023, Brian Sikes was appointed president and CEO.

====India====
Starting operations in 1987, Cargill had a foods business unit called Cargill Foods India which processes, refines and markets a wide range of both indigenous and imported edible oils, fats and blends to the food industry including Sweekar, Nature Fresh, Gemini, Rath and Shakti brands of edible oil. In 2012 it launched Chakki Fresh Atta in India under the brand name &quot;Sampoorna&quot;. Its customers are in the retail, food service sector and beverage industry.

Apart from sugar and cotton, Cargill India is also one of India&#x27;s largest originators and marketers of food and coarse grains. It has its own Trade and Structured Finance arm, which also operates the Cargill Capital and Financial Services India Private Limited. Its Cargill Energy, Transport and Metals BU is active across ocean freight, coal, iron ore and steel trading. It bought Sunflower Oil Brand From Wipro In December 2012.

After the government of India, Cargill is India&#x27;s second-largest buyer of food grain. It has been buying grains and oilseeds in India since 1998. It also has the largest producer of potash, Mosaic.

====Pakistan====
Cargill started doing business in Pakistan in 1984. Cargill Pakistan Holdings was incorporated on January 25, 1990. In the 1980s, Cargill sold hybrid safflower seeds extensively in Pakistan. Today, Cargill imports palm oil and palm oil products from Malaysia and Indonesia into Pakistan, selling them in the local market. It also buys raw cotton bales from producers in Pakistan and sells them to China, Thailand and Vietnam. Cargill also deals in animal feed, agriculture commodities, cotton, grain and oilseeds, metals, palm and sugar business in Pakistan.

In January 2019, Cargill announced a $200 million investment to grow business in Pakistan.

===Europe===
In late 2022, Cargill confirmed that it would be able to export grain harvested in Ukraine despite the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. But it reported that it no longer controlled two facilities used to crush sunflower seeds, and that total Ukrainian production would therefore be 60% to 70% of normal.

====Meat processing plants====

==Criticism==

As a private company, Cargill is not required to release the same amount of information as a publicly traded company and, as a business practice, keeps a relatively low profile.

In 2019 the NGO Mighty Earth released a 56-page report on Cargill. Mighty Earth chair and former U.S. Congressman Henry A. Waxman called Cargill &quot;the worst company in the world&quot; and said it drives &quot;the most important problems facing our world&quot; (deforestation, pollution, climate change, exploitation) &quot;at a scale that dwarfs their closest competitors.&quot;

In 2019, the Swiss NGO Public Eye also criticized Cargill in various contexts in a report on agricultural commodity traders in Switzerland.

===Child trafficking===
In 2005, the International Labor Rights Fund filed suit against Cargill, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland in a US federal court on behalf of children who said they were trafficked from Mali into Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and forced to work on cocoa bean plantations 12 to 14 hours a day with no pay, little food and sleep, and frequent physical abuse.

Even more recent evidence stems from a 2019 TV program on French channel France 2 about cocoa illegally harvested from protected areas in Côte d’Ivoire. The report found child labor to be widespread on the plantations investigated: every third worker was a child. Instances of child trafficking from neighboring Burkina Faso were also reported. Cargill, which buys from the plantations under investigation, at first denied that it was buying cocoa from protected areas, but was forced to admit that its traceability system had not reached these areas, and therefore that it could not fully trace the origins of its cocoa. Swiss-based food giant Nestlé is one of Cargill&#x27;s biggest customers of cocoa sourced from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, as later reported by Swiss TV channel RTS 1.

In 2021, eight former child slaves from Mali named Cargill in a class action lawsuit, alleging that it aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The suit accused Cargill, along with Nestlé, Barry Callebaut, Mars, Incorporated, Olam International, The Hershey Company, and Mondelez International, of knowingly engaging in forced labor, and sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

===Child labor in Uzbekistan===
Cargill was a major buyer of cotton in Uzbekistan, despite the industry prevalence of uncompensated workers and possible human rights abuses, and admissions by two representatives that the company is aware of the possible use of child labor in the production of its crops. Their concerns have been public since 2005, but no action has been taken on labor violations in Cargill&#x27;s Uzbek operations.

===Union busting===
In February 2018, several employees of Cargill&#x27;s Dayton, Virginia plant held protests. Their grievances included poor health benefits, bad working conditions, and Cargill&#x27;s allegedly firing employees who organized to create a union. The protests led to nine people&#x27;s arrest for trespassing on company property.

===Worker safety during COVID-19===
During the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, a single meat processing plant in High River, Canada, was linked to over 358 cases of infection. United Food and Commercial Workers Canada Union Local 401 president Thomas Hesse said, &quot;It&#x27;s a tragedy. We asked days and days ago for that plant to be closed temporarily for two weeks, send all of the workers home with pay to isolate. That was when we were aware of 38 cases. That was before they set up a dedicated testing facility in the area.&quot; Reports of employees being denied personal protective equipment also surfaced around the same period. As of May 3, 2020, 917 of the plant&#x27;s 2,000 workers had tested positive, and the plant was linked to 1,501 total cases.

=== Land grabbing ===
The NGO Oxfam has documented an illustrative case of land grabbing. Between 2010 and 2012 Cargill brought huge areas of land in Colombia under its control despite legal restrictions on the acquisition of state land. To accomplish this, Cargill set up no fewer than 36 mailbox companies, which enabled it to exceed the legally prescribed maximum size of land ownership. With more than 50,000 hectares of land, Cargill thus acquired more than 30 times the land legally permitted for a single owner.

=== Food contamination ===

In 1971, Cargill sold 63,000 tons of seed treated with a methylmercury-based fungicide that eventually caused a minimum of 650 deaths when it was eaten. The fumigated seed grain was provided by Cargill at the specific request of Saddam Hussein and was never intended for direct human or animal consumption prior to planting.

Cargill&#x27;s grain—which was dyed red and labeled with warnings in Spanish and English as well as a skull and crossbones design following a previous incident of mercury-treated seed being sold as food in Iraqi markets in 1960—was distributed too late for much of the 1971 planting season, causing many farmers to sell their excess product in the public markets at very low prices; this attracted many poor Iraqis who either could not understand the warnings or disregarded them, causing thousands of cases of mercury poisoning. The long latency period before developing symptoms and cattle&#x27;s greater tolerance of mercury poisoning also contributed to the mistaken impression the surplus seed grain was safe to eat.

In October 2007, Cargill announced the recall of nearly 850,000 frozen beef patties produced at its packing plant in Butler, Wisconsin that were suspected of being contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot;. The beef was sold mainly at Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club stores.

In March 2009, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) temporarily suspended Cargill Australia&#x27;s license to export meat to Japan and the US after &quot;E. coli&quot; was detected in Cargill&#x27;s export containers from its Wagga Wagga plant. In late April 2009, AQIS lifted Cargill Australia&#x27;s suspension on its export license.

In August 2011, the USDA and Cargill jointly announced the recall of 36 million pounds of ground turkey produced at Cargill&#x27;s Springdale, Arkansas, plant due to salmonella fears. The meat recalled was produced from February 20 to August 2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the particular strain of salmonella found was resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics. One death and 76 illnesses from 26 states were reported. Some 25 types of ground turkey produced under various brand names were affected, and all of the packages in question contained the code &quot;Est. P-963.&quot;

In September 2011, Cargill announced a second, immediate and voluntary Class One recall of 185,000 pounds of 85% lean, fresh-ground turkey products because of possible contamination from Salmonella Heidelberg. The turkey was produced at the company&#x27;s Springdale, Arkansas, facility on August 23, 24, 30 and 31.

In July 2012, the Vermont Department of Public Health said that 10 people in the state had become sick from ground beef being recalled by Cargill Beef. The 10 became sick between June 6 and 26. Three were hospitalized, and all recovered, according to health officials. Hannaford Supermarkets alerted consumers that Cargill Beef was voluntarily recalling 29,339 pounds of ground beef that might contain salmonella. The 85%-lean ground beef was produced at Cargill&#x27;s plant in Wyalusing, Pennsylvania, on May 25, 2012, and repackaged for sale to consumers by customers of the Kansas-based company.

===Deforestation===

==== Soy ====
In 2003, Cargill completed a port for processing soya in Santarém in the Amazon region of Brazil, dramatically increasing soya production in the area and, according to Greenpeace, speeding up deforestation of local rain forest. In February 2006, the federal courts in Brazil gave Cargill six months to complete an environmental assessment (EA). Initially supported by job-seeking locals, public opinion turned against the port as jobs have not appeared. In July 2006, the federal prosecutor indicated they were close to shutting down the port.

Greenpeace took its campaign to major food retailers and quickly won agreement from McDonald&#x27;s along with UK-retailers Asda, Waitrose, and Marks &amp; Spencer to stop buying meat raised on Amazonian soya. These retailers have, in turn, put pressure on Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, André Maggi Group, and Dreyfus to prove their soya was not grown on recently deforested land in the Amazon. In July 2006, Cargill reportedly joined other soy businesses in Brazil in a two-year moratorium on the purchase of soybeans from newly deforested land.

In 2019 the six largest agricultural commodity traders, ADM, Bunge, Cargill, LDC, COFCO Int. and Glencore Agri, committed themselves to monitoring their soy supply chains in Brazil&#x27;s Cerrado.

==== Palm oil ====
Cargill sells large volumes of palm oil, which is found in many processed foods, cosmetics and detergents. Most palm oil is obtained from plantations in Sumatra and Borneo, which have been heavily deforested to make way for them.

==== Cocoa ====
On September 13, 2017, NGO Mighty Earth released a report documenting findings that Cargill purchases cocoa grown illegally in national parks and other protected forests in the Ivory Coast.

The report accused Cargill of endangering the forest habitats of chimpanzees, elephants and other wildlife populations by purchasing cocoa linked to deforestation. As a result of cocoa production, 7 of the 23 Ivorian protected areas have been almost entirely converted to cocoa. Cargill was notified of the findings of Mighty Earth&#x27;s investigation and did not deny that the company sourced its cocoa from protected areas in the Ivory Coast. 

Data released in April 2019 by Global Forest Watch, an online platform providing data and tools for monitoring forests, showed that rates of tropical primary forest loss increased dramatically in 2018 in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, primarily due to cocoa farming and gold mining. In 2018 Ghana had the highest rate of increase (60%) in the world compared to 2017, with Côte d’Ivoire (26%) in second place.

===Air pollution===
In 2005, the company settled with the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency over Clean Air Act violations, including a plan to invest over $60 million in capital improvements for clean air controls, after a joint federal and state effort that included Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota and Ohio.

In 2006, NatureWorks, a subsidiary in Nebraska, settled with the state over inadequate air pollution controls.

In 2015, Cargill settled with the EPA over Clean Air Act violations in a plant in Iowa.

=== Tax evasion ===
In 2011 a case of transfer mispricing came to light in Argentina involving the world&#x27;s four largest grain traders: ADM, Bunge, Cargill, and LDC. Argentina&#x27;s revenue and customs service began an investigation into the four companies when prices for agricultural commodities spiked in 2008 but very little profit for the four companies had been reported to the office. As a result of the investigation, it was alleged that the companies had submitted false declarations of sales and routed profits through tax havens or their headquarters. In some cases they were said to have used dummy corporations to buy grain and inflated costs in Argentina to reduce the recorded profits there. According to Argentina&#x27;s revenue and customs service, the outstanding taxes amounted to almost US$1 billion. The companies involved have denied the allegations. As of 2019, the Argentinian tax authorities have not replied to Swiss NGO Public Eye’s request as to the state of the case.

In its 2018 annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bunge mentioned provisions that suggested the case was still ongoing: &quot;[A]s of December 31, 2018, Bunge&#x27;s Argentine subsidiary had received income tax assessments relating to 2006 through 2009 of approximately 1,276 million Argentine pesos (approximately $34 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount of approximately 4,246 million Argentine pesos (approximately $113 million]).&quot;

<text>The Pacific Star is a military campaign medal instituted by the United Kingdom in May 1945 for award to British and Commonwealth forces who served in the Pacific Campaign from 1941 to 1945, during the Second World War.

One clasp, Burma, was instituted to be worn on the medal ribbon.

==The Second World War Stars==
On 8 July 1943, the Star (later named the Star) and the Africa Star became the first two campaign stars instituted by the United Kingdom, and by May 1945 a total of eight stars and nine clasps had been established to reward campaign service during the Second World War. One more campaign star, the Arctic Star, and one more clasp, the Bomber Command Clasp, were belatedly added on 26 February 2013, more than sixty-seven years after the end of the war.

Including the Arctic Star and the Bomber Command clasp, no-one could be awarded more than six campaign stars, with five of the ten clasps denoting service that would have qualified for a second star. Only one clasp could be worn on any one campaign star. The maximum of six possible stars are the following:

* The 1939–1945 Star with, when awarded, either the Battle of Britain or the Bomber Command clasp.
* Only one of the Atlantic Star, Air Crew Europe Star or France and Germany Star. Those earning more than one received the first qualified for, with the second denoted by the appropriate ribbon clasp.
* The Arctic Star.
* The Africa Star with, if awarded, the first earned of clasps for North Africa 1942–43, 8th Army or 1st Army.
* Either the Pacific Star or Burma Star. Those earning both received the first qualified for, with the appropriate clasp to represent the second.
* The Italy Star.

All recipients of campaign stars also received the War Medal.

==Institution==
At the same time as the Second World War campaigns against Axis Forces in Africa and Europe, Allied forces were also fighting the Japanese in the Pacific. This campaign began on 8 December 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. It took place in the sea and air of the Pacific Ocean as well as on land, with Japanese forces quickly invading Malaya, Singapore and the Philippines. While the Japanese advance across the Pacific was stemmed by mid–1942 the war continued, both at sea and on numerous Pacific islands, until the final Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945.

The Pacific Star was instituted by the United Kingdom in May 1945 for award to those who had served in operations in the Pacific Campaign from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.

==Award criteria==
The eligibility criteria for the award of the Pacific Star were different for service at sea, on land and in the air.

===General===
No recipient could receive both the Pacific and the Burma Stars. A clasp inscribed &#x27;Burma&#x27; was instituted to be worn on the Pacific Star&#x27;s ribbon by those who earned the Pacific Star and who subsequently qualified for the Burma Star.

The award of a gallantry medal or Mention in Dispatches qualified the recipient for the award of the Pacific Star, regardless of service duration. Those whose qualifying service period was terminated prematurely by their death or disability due to service were also awarded the Star.

===Service afloat===
Naval personnel qualified for service at sea within certain specified boundaries.

Between 8 December 1941 and 2 September 1945, once the 1939–1945 Star had already been earned, Naval and Merchant Navy service of one or more days in the Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea, and in the Indian Ocean east of a line running due south from Singapore round the south-east coast of Sumatra, through Christmas Island, and southwards along the Meridian of 110° East qualified for the award of the Pacific Star.
In 1994, the Australian government conducted a review of the conditions for award of the Pacific Star, as set out in Command Paper 6833 of June 1946. As a result, the conditions for award were amended to include any member of the Australian military who was on board the Australian Hospital Ship &quot;Centaur&quot; when it was torpedoed and sunk on 14 May 1943. The Pacific Star can be awarded to these men and women regardless of whether they had been awarded or were eligible for the 1939–1945 Star, the Australia Service Medal 1939–1945 or any other campaign award.

Certain special conditions applied governing the award of the Pacific Star to those Naval personnel who entered operational service less than six months before the end of the war. Those who entered operational service in the qualifying area on or after 7 March 1945 and who did not thereafter serve in the area qualifying for the Burma Star, could qualify for the Pacific Star by entry into operational service. In such cases, however, the 1939–1945 Star could not be awarded for service of less than 180 days.

===Service ashore===
Army, Naval and Air Force personnel serving ashore in those territories which had been subjected to enemy or allied invasions had no prior time restriction and qualified upon entry into the prescribed area of land operations.

Qualifying service on land was restricted to operational service in the following territories in which there had been enemy or Allied invasions, service in Burma excluded and all dates inclusive:
* Bismarck Archipelago from 22 January 1942 to 2 September 1945.
* British North Borneo, Brunei, Sarawak and Dutch Borneo from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Caroline Islands from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Celebes from 26 January 1942 to 2 September 1945.
* China from 11 December 1941 to 15 February 1942.
* Gilbert and Ellice Islands from 10 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Guam from 12 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Hong Kong from 8 December 1941 to 25 December 1941.
* Iwo Jima from 8 December 1941 to 25 December 1941.
* Java from 5 March 1942 to 2 September 1945.
* Malaya from 8 December 1941 to 15 February 1942.
* Marianas from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Marshall Islands from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Molucca Islands from 30 January 1942 to 2 September 1945.
* Nauru from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* New Guinea from 7 March 1942 to 2 September 1945.
* Ocean Island from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Okinawa from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Philippines Islands from 10 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.
* Solomon Islands (British Solomon Islands Protectorate and Australian Mandated Territory) from 1 February 1942 to 2 September 1945.
* Sumatra from 14 February 1942 to 23 March 1942.
* Timor from 20 February 1942 to 2 September 1945.
* Wake Island from 22 December 1941 to 2 September 1945.

Service in China, Hong Kong, Malaya and Sumatra after the respective end dates listed above was recognised by the award of the Burma Star.

Service in Norfolk Island, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Fiji Islands, Tonga Islands, Phoenix Islands and Fanning Island did not qualify for the Pacific Star.

===Airborne Service===
Air crew engaged in operations against the enemy qualified, provided they had already earned the 1939–1945 Star and had completed at least one operational sortie over the appropriate sea or land area. Air crew on transport or ferrying duties qualified by at least three landings in any of the qualifying land areas.

Troops who took part in airborne operations in a qualifying area for land operations qualified by entry into operational service.

==Description==
The set of nine campaign stars was designed by the Royal Mint engravers. The stars all have a ring suspender that passes through an eyelet formed above the uppermost point of the star. They are six–pointed stars, struck in yellow copper zinc alloy to fit into a 44 millimetres diameter circle, with a maximum width of 38 millimetres and 50 millimetres high from the bottom point of the star to the top of the eyelet.

;Obverse
The obverse has a central design of the Royal Cypher &quot;GRI VI&quot;, surmounted by a crown. A circlet, the top of which is covered by the crown, surrounds the cypher and is inscribed &quot;THE PACIFIC STAR&quot;.

;Reverse
The reverse is plain.

;Naming
The British Honours Committee decided that Second World War campaign medals awarded to British forces would be issued unnamed, a policy applied by all but three British Commonwealth countries. The recipient&#x27;s details were impressed on the reverse of the stars awarded to Indians, South Africans and, after a campaign led by veteran organisations, to Australians. In the case of South Africans and Australians, naming consisted of the recipient&#x27;s force number, initials and surname in block capitals, with awards to Indians also showing the service arm or corps.

;Clasp

The clasp, designed to be sewn onto the medal&#x27;s ribbon, was struck in yellow copper zinc alloy and has a frame with an inside edge that resembles the perforated edge of a postage stamp. When medals are not worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon bar to denote the award of the clasp.

;Ribbon
The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide with a 5½ millimetres wide Army red band, a 3 millimetres wide navy blue band, a 6 millimetres wide dark green band, a 3 millimetres wide yellow band, a 6 millimetres wide dark green band, a 3 millimetres wide Royal Air Force blue band and a 5½ millimetres wide Army red band. The forests and beaches of the Pacific are represented by the dark green and yellow bands respectively, while the Royal Navy and Merchant Navy, the Armies and the Air Forces are represented by the dark blue, red and light blue bands respectively.

The ribbons for this medal and the Defence Medal as well as those of the other Second World War campaign stars, with the exception of the Arctic Star, were devised by King George VI.

==Order of wear==
The order of wear of the Second World War campaign stars was determined by their respective campaign start dates and by the campaign&#x27;s duration. This is the order worn, even when a recipient qualified for them in a different order. The Defence Medal and War Medal are worn after the stars. The Canadian Volunteer Service Medal is worn after the Defence Medal and before the War Medal, with other Commonwealth war medals worn after the War Medal.
* The 1939–1945 Star, from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, the full duration of the Second World War.
* The Atlantic Star, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Battle of the Atlantic and the War in Europe.
* The Arctic Star, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Arctic Convoys and the War in Europe.
* The Air Crew Europe Star, from 3 September 1939 to 5 June 1944, the period until D-Day minus one.
* The Africa Star, from 10 June 1940 to 12 May 1943, the duration of the North African Campaign.
* The Pacific Star, from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Pacific War.
* The Burma Star, from 11 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Burma Campaign.
* The Italy Star, from 11 June 1943 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Italian Campaign.
* The France and Germany Star, from 6 June 1944 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the North West Europe Campaign.
* The Defence Medal, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945 (2 September 1945 for those serving in the Far East and the Pacific), the duration of the Second World War.
* The War Medal, from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, the full duration of the Second World War.

The Pacific Star is therefore worn as shown:
* Preceded by the Africa Star.
* Succeeded by the Burma Star, but that ribbon could not be awarded together with the Pacific Star. As such, on any bar the Pacific Star would be followed by the Italy Star or another medal that was lower in the order of precedence.

<text>Joseph Gerald Hagey (September 28, 1904 – October 26, 1988) was a Canadian businessman, academic, and a founder and first president of the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario.

==Biography==
Hagey was born and raised in Hamilton, Ontario, the son of Menno Hagey (1863-1946) and Esther Cornell (1861-1907). In 1928 he received a B.A. from Waterloo College, at that time a small church college affiliated with the University of Western Ontario. After graduation, he took a job in sales for B.F. Goodrich, a Kitchener-based rubber company. By the 1950s he had become an advertising and public relations manager, though throughout this time he had continued to be involved in the affairs of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Waterloo College.

In 1953 he left B.F. Goodrich to become the president of Waterloo College. The 1950s and 1960s saw a massive expansion in industry and academia because of the postwar economic boom and because of the impending arrival of the baby boomers at Canadian universities. Hagey&#x27;s goal was the transformation of Waterloo College into a university with a particular focus on science and technology, and close links with industry through co-operative education.

This idea proved somewhat controversial, and Hagey ultimately became the founding president of the University of Waterloo in 1957, when the science and engineering faculties he had established broke away from the rest of Waterloo College, which later became Wilfrid Laurier University.

He retired in 1969 after the removal of his larynx due to cancer. When Hagey retired he had helped the University of Waterloo grow from 75 students in two portable classrooms to a rambling campus worth $80 million and a student population of 9,000. A building on the UW campus, the J.G. Hagey Hall of the Humanities, is named in his honour.

In 1967 he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University.

In April 1986, he was invested as a member into the Order of Canada.

Hagey was the great-grandson of Mennonite Bishop Joseph B. Hagey and the cousin of Brantford MPP Louis Hagey.

<text>Priscilla de Villiers is a Canadian activist, who was the founder and president of CAVEAT, an organization advocating governmental policy on crime.

==Biography==

She was born in South Africa.

De Villiers is the mother of Nina de Villiers, a McMaster University student who was murdered on August 9, 1991 by Jonathon Yeo while jogging in Burlington, Ontario. Her killer had, according to CAVEAT&#x27;s website, &quot;a long history of violence.&quot;

This event prompted de Villiers to enter public life and found CAVEAT to lobby government policy to strengthen laws in the hopes of preventing similar incidents. CAVEAT, a not-for-profit charitable organization, was founded in June, 1992 and received its charitable designation in October, 1992.

In 1993, McMaster University created a memorial garden dedicated to Nina de Villiers on the university grounds, in front of University Hall.
In May, 1995, she received an honorary doctorate of law from McMaster University, Hamilton.
In August–September 2000 she ran in a by-election in the riding of Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot for the Ontario PC Party, where she lost to Ted McMeekin.

After that Ms. de Villiers was appointed Special Advisor to the Ontario Office for Victims of Crime where she continued to provide direct support to victims of crime and conduct research on issues that impact victimization. The research resulted in a report on the role of victims of crime in restorative justice in Ontario. Her appointment ended in January 2005.

In 2006 she was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Victim Issues to the Policy Centre on Victim Issues, Department of Justice, Canada.

In March 2007 Priscilla de Villiers was appointed as a member of the Ontario Office for Victims of Crime.

==Charity work==
CAVEAT (&quot;Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating for its Termination&quot;) was a Canadian lobby group which existed from 1991 to May 10, 2001, based in Burlington, Ontario. The organization agitated for a number of changes in government policy, particularly in promotion of &quot;tough-on-crime&quot; legislation and increased gun control. It was founded by Priscilla de Villiers in 1991, after her daughter Nina was murdered.

=== Archives ===

<doc id="952306" wikidata="Q371568" url="?curid=952306" title="Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer">
<text>Marjorie Eileen Doris Courtenay-Latimer (24 February 190717 May 2004) was a South African museum official, who in 1938, brought the existence of the coelacanth, a fish thought to have been extinct for 65 million years, to the attention of the world.
==Personal life==
Courtenay-Latimer was born in East London, South Africa. She was the daughter of a stationmaster for South African Railways. She was born two months prematurely and was sickly throughout her childhood, nearly dying on one occasion due to a diphtheria infection. Despite her frailty, from a young age she was an avid naturalist and enjoyed outdoor activities. When she visited her grandmother on the coast, she was fascinated by the lighthouse on Bird Island. At age eleven, she vowed she would become an expert on birds.

After school, she trained to become a nurse at King William&#x27;s Town but, just before finishing her training, she was alerted to a job opening at the recently opened East London Museum, East London, Eastern Cape. Although never having received any formal training, she impressed her interviewers with her range of South African naturalistic knowledge and was hired at the age of 24 in August 1931.

Courtenay-Latimer spent the rest of her career at the museum, retiring first to a farm at Tsitsikamma where she wrote a book on flowers and then headed back to East London.

She never married due to the &quot;love of her life&quot; dying in her twenties.

==Delivery of the coelacanth==
She busily worked on collecting rocks, feathers, shells, and the like for her museum, and made her desire to see unusual specimens known to fishermen. On 22 December 1938, she received a telephone call asking if she would examine bycatch from the trawler &quot;Nerine&quot;, which had just returned to port under the command of Captain Hendrik Goosen, and it was among this bycatch that she found one striking specimen:

I picked away at the layers of slime to reveal the most beautiful fish I had ever seen... It was long, a pale mauvy blue with faint flecks of whitish spots; it had an iridescent silver-blue-green sheen all over. It was covered in hard scales, and it had four limb-like fins and a strange puppy dog tail. It was such a beautiful fish—more like a big china ornament—but I didn&#x27;t know what it was.

She and her assistant hauled the fish to her museum in a taxi and tried to find it in her books without success. Eager to preserve the strange fish and having no facilities at the museum, Courtenay-Latimer took it first to the town mortuary and then the cold storage facility, each of which in turn refused to store it. She eventually took it to a taxidermist of her acquaintance, Robert Center, who helped her wrap it in formalin-soaked newspaper and bedsheets so that it could be preserved for identification by her friend J. L. B. Smith, an ichthyologist at Rhodes University. Her attempts to contact Smith unfortunately went unanswered at first, as Smith was away on holidays, and having heard no response by 27 December—by which time the fish had begun to decay and ooze oil in the hot, humid South African summer— she reluctantly gave the go-ahead for Center to skin and gut the fish in preparation for it to be mounted.

Smith eventually did make contact with Courtenay-Latimer some days later, and upon first seeing the taxidermied specimen on 16 February, he instantly recognized her specimen as a coelacanth. &quot;There was not a shadow of a doubt,&quot; he said. &quot;It could have been one of those creatures of 200 million years ago come alive again.&quot; Smith would give it the scientific name &quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot; after his friend and the Chalumna River, where it was found. It would be fourteen more years before another was brought in.

<doc id="952308" wikidata="Q1751844" url="?curid=952308" title="RAF Spadeadam">
<text>RAF Spadeadam (pronounced &quot;Spade Adam&quot;) is a Royal Air Force (RAF) station in Cumbria, England, close to the border with Northumberland. It is the home of the 9,000 acre (36 km2) electronic warfare (EW) tactics range, making it the largest (by area) RAF base in the United Kingdom. Its primary use is for EW training to the RAF and NATO allies. The site and course of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall runs a few miles south of the range.

==Spadeadam==
The Spadeadam area was remote and largely uninhabited and known as Spadeadam Waste. The name is possibly a corruption of Cumbric &quot;ysbyddaden&quot; &quot;hawthorn&quot;, or &quot;ysbytybrenin&quot; &quot;king&#x27;s hostel&quot;, and in 1950 the recorded pronunciation was . It is mentioned as &quot;Speir Adam&quot; or &quot;Spear Edom&quot; in &quot;Hobie Noble&quot;.

==History==
===Cold War===

The site was first built in 1955 to be the test centre for the Blue Streak intermediate-range ballistic missile project. The role of Spadeadam in Britain&#x27;s Cold War nuclear weapons programme was made public in 2004 when tree felling uncovered remains of abandoned excavations for an experimental missile silo. Spadeadam was probably intended to be one of 60 launch sites planned for remote locations.

The Rocket Establishment, as it was called, was divided into five areas: an administration and assembly block, a British Oxygen Company compound for on-site liquid oxygen fuel manufacture, a component test area, the engine test area and the static firing stands. The engine test area at Prior Lancy Rigg consisted of four concrete stands into which the engines could be mounted for test firing. Two rocket-firing stands themselves stood at Greymare Hills and were large enough to accommodate a full Blue Streak missile.

The RAF took the site over in 1976 and it became Europe&#x27;s first electronic warfare tactics range in 1977.

===Post-Cold War===
The site continues to be used in training the Royal Air Force and NATO allied aircrew in electronic warfare. It also hosts other exercising forces such as JFACTSU forward air controller training delivered from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire. Close air support (CAS) training is carried out too. Since 2006, this has been the only mainland UK location where aircrews can drop practice bombs.

DNV (previously Advantica) uses the site for industrial hazard testing including fire and the destruction of pipelines. The remoteness of the area is key to their operations.

In July 2021, RAF Spadeadam was used to conduct drone swarm trials; a first for the British Armed Forces.

==Landscape==
The outlying moorland landscape of the site is of increasing importance for its visual quality and for nature conservation. The area includes a pristine peat bog, populations of all three species of British newt and forestry habitat suitable for endangered red squirrels. Otters have been noted along the watercourses and still ponds that are dotted across the vast training area. Trees that were planted on the site after the First World War were felled in 2008 to 2009 to allow the peat bogs to return. Despite concerns about trees being carbon sinks, the rarity of the peat habitat meant the Forestry Commission decided to fell 145,000 trees.

==Freedoms==
RAF Spadeadam has received the Freedom of several locations throughout its history; these include:
* 18 June 2017: Brampton.
* 2 June 2018: Carlisle.

<doc id="952311" wikidata="Q5404301" url="?curid=952311" title="Ethnic origins of people in Canada">
<text>According to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 &quot;ethnic or cultural origins&quot; were self-reported by Canadians. The country&#x27;s ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).

Of the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021 approximately 25.4 million reported being White, representing 69.8 percent of the population. The indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021. One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority, the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7million; 4.7 percent), and Black (1.5million; 4.3 percent), Filipinos (960,000 2.6 percent), Arabs (690,000; 1.9 percent), Latin Americans (580,000; 1.6 percent), Southeast Asians (390,000; 1.1 percent), West Asians (360,000; 1.0 percent), Koreans (220,000; 0.6 percent) and Japanese (99,000; 0.3 percent).

Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada&#x27;s population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. The 2021 census indicated that 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0 percent) of the population reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent. In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada.

==Statistics Canada report on race and ethnicity in Canada in 2022==
The 2020 General Social Survey revealed that 92% of adult Canadians said that &quot;[ethnic] diversity is a Canadian value&quot;. About 25% of Canadians were &quot;racialized&quot;; By 2021, 23% of the Canadian population were immigrantsthe &quot;largest proportion since Confederation&quot;, according to Statistics Canada. Prior to the early 1970s, most new Canadians came from Europe. Since then, more immigrants have come from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In 2021, most immigrants came from Asia, which includes the Middle East. About 25% of Canadians were &quot;racialized&quot;; By 2021, almost 5% of Canadians self-identify as Muslim. Almost a million Canadians self-identified as Indigenous.

==Data collection method==
Listed below are the ethnic groups of Canadian residents (citizens, landed immigrants and non-citizen temporary residents) as self-identified in the 2016 census in which approximately 35,151,000 census forms were completed). The relevant census question asked for &quot;the ethnic or cultural origins&quot; of the respondent&#x27;s ancestors and not the respondents themselves.
As data were collected by self-declaration, ethnic groups may not necessarily correspond to the true ancestry of respondents. Many respondents acknowledged multiple ancestries. These people were added to the &quot;multiple origin&quot; total for each origin listed. These include responses as varied as a respondent who listed eight different origins and a respondent who answered &quot;French Canadian&quot; (leading to them being counted once for &quot;French&quot; and once for &quot;Canadian&quot;). As with all self-reported data, understanding of the question may have varied from respondent to respondent.

== Evolution from 1871 to 1921 ==

During the fifty-year period beginning from the first census of independent Canada in 1871 until the census of 1921, the national ethnic composition was multicultural, however in the early period was dominated by four origin groups from western and northern Europe: French, English, Irish, and Scottish. Following the French and British Isles origin groups, Continental European communities were the largest in Canada, and grew fairly rapidly between the 1901 census and the 1921 census. Nominally small East Asian, South Asian, West Asian, and West African descended communities also existed during this time period.

The ethnic French population, comprising a plurality of the total population from confederation until just prior to the 1921 census, overwhelmingly relied on natural increase for growth, with progeny stemming from early settlers who arrived throughout the 17th and 18th centuries; migration from France had been severely curtailed by the British Empire and early governments of independent Canada. Population growth amongst the French population occurred at relatively high pace, increasing from 1,082,940 persons in 1871 to 2,452,743 persons in 1921. Despite an increase of nearly 1.5 million persons during this fifty-year period, the French proportion of the total Canadian population dropped slightly, from 31.1 percent, to 27.1 percent.

By contrast, large population increases amongst the three main ethnic groups from the British Isles (English, Irish, and Scottish) occurred through natural increase but relied heavily on high immigration rates that began in the early-mid 19th century dubbed the &quot;Great Migration of Canada&quot; − this continued through the early 20th century, spurred by record immigration rates during the 1900s and 1910s, when English immigrants formed a majority or plurality of all immigrants to Canada on an annual and decadal basis.

The English population, in particular, grew at a rapid pace, increasing from 705,369 persons in 1871 to 2,545,358 persons in 1921, representing an increase of nearly 2 million persons during the fifty-year period. During the same time period, the English proportion of the total Canadian population rose from 20.3 percent to 29.0 percent. The English community experienced massive growth principally during the first two decades of the 20th century as a result of record immigration at the time; during the era, persons of English descent also became the single largest ethnic group in Canada, comprising a plurality of the Canadian population by the 1921 census.

The Irish population, meanwhile, witnessed steady, slowing population growth during the late 19th and early 20th century, with the proportion of the total Canadian population dropping from 24.3 percent in 1871 to 12.6 percent in 1921 and falling from the second-largest ethnic group in Canada from to fourth − principally due to massive immigration flows from England to Canada at the time − despite the population increasing from 846,414 persons to 1,107,803 persons in the fifty-year timeframe. The largest Irish population increases occurred prior to confederation, spurred by mass immigration during the mid-19th century at the height of the &quot;Great Migration of Canada&quot;, and was primarily due to &quot;The Great Famine&quot; and related poor economic conditions in Ireland at the time.

At the turn of the 20th century, overall immigrant proportions from the British Isles to Canada gradually dropped from a majority to a plurality. At the time, the federal government began supplementing increased mass immigration from the British Isles (mainly England) by also permitting large migration flows from continental Europe, especially Germany, Scandinavia, and the Soviet Union. This was primarily as a result of federal policy aimed at settling the Prairies through ethnic block settlements and ultimately led to the highest annual immigration rates in Canadian history since confederation in 1867 that remain unsurpassed in the contemporary era, including 1913 (new immigrants accounted for 5.3 percent of the total population), 1912 (5.1 percent), 1911 (4.6 percent), 1907 (4.3 percent) and 1910 (4.1 percent).

Largely due to increased immigration levels outside of the British Isles, the continental European population grew rapidly during the first two decades of the 20th century − comprising 1,246,151 persons or 14.2 percent as proportion of the total Canadian population by the 1921 census, representing a numerical increase of over 1 million persons from fifty years earlier in 1871, when the continental European population stood at approximately 236,043 persons or 6.8 percent of the total Canadian population.

Broadening the multicultural makeup of Canada, the diversity across the Prairie provinces during the early 20th century was soon dubbed a &quot;cultural mosaic&quot; by journalist Victoria Hayward in the early 1920s:


== Evolution from 1996 to 2016 ==
As regards combined responses, Canadian is the most common ethnic origin (11,113,965) in the 2016 Census (see above). This was also the case in the 2011 NHS (10,563,805), 2006 Census (10,066,290), 2001 Census (11,682,680), and the 1996 Census (8,806,975). Canadian was also the most common &quot;single&quot; ethnic origin in the 1996 (5,326,995), 2001 (6,748,135), 2006 (5,748,725), 2011 (5,834,535), and 2016 (6,436,940).

<text>Gangster World (alternatively titled The Outsider for its video release) is a 1997 made-for-TV science fiction film directed by David Bishop and written by Patrick Highsmith and Evan Spiliotopoulos. It was about a futuristic theme park in which people interact with androids in violent (and sometimes sexual) gangster-style scenarios. Despite the title and premise, it is unconnected with the film &quot;Westworld&quot;.

In 1998, a DVD was released of the film.

<text>Alan Harvey Bible (November 20, 1909 – September 12, 1988) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States Senator from Nevada from 1954 to 1974. He previously served as Attorney General of Nevada from 1942 to 1950.

==Early life and education==
Alan Bible was born in Lovelock, Nevada, to Jacob Harvey and Isabel (née Welsh) Bible. His family was originally from Germany, and settled in Virginia; Bible&#x27;s grandfather moved to Ohio before the Civil War and subsequently fought with the Union Army. His father operated a grocery store and a cattle ranch outside of Lovelock, while his mother worked as a schoolteacher. The family lived on their ranch until 1919, when a fire destroyed their home. They then moved to Fallon, where Bible attended Oats Park Grammar School and Churchill County High School. During high school, he was active in debating and served as president of the freshman and senior classes.

Bible then studied at the University of Nevada in Reno, from where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in 1930. He joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity in his sophomore year, and became class treasurer and assistant editor of &quot;The Sagebrush&quot; in his junior year. In 1934, Bible earned his law degree from Georgetown University Law School in Washington, D.C. While studying in Washington, he was given a job as an elevator operator in the Capitol Building by Senator Pat McCarran.

==Early career==
Bible was admitted to the Nevada bar in 1935 and joined Senator McCarran&#x27;s law firm in Reno. Six months later, he was appointed district attorney of Storey County, a position he held for three years. He became active in the affairs of the Democratic Party, organizing a chapter of the Young Democrats and helping select delegates to the state Democratic Committee. He also became a prominent member of the political machine run by Senator McCarran. From 1938 to 1942, he served as deputy Attorney General of Nevada.

In 1939, Bible married Loucile Shields; the couple had one daughter, Debra, and three sons, Paul, William, and David. He was elected Attorney General of Nevada in 1942, defeating Republican candidate John Rolly Ross by more than 7,000 votes. During his tenure, he strengthened the state&#x27;s power to regulate the gambling industry and became an expert in water law. He served as attorney general until 1950, when he returned to private practice.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1952, Bible was narrowly defeated for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, losing to political newcomer Thomas B. Mechling by 475 votes. However, after the death of Senator McCarran in September 1954, Bible was elected to the Senate the following November to fill the remainder of McCarran&#x27;s term. He defeated Republican Ernest S. Brown, who had been appointed to McCarran&#x27;s seat by Governor Charles H. Russell, by a margin of 58%-42%.

Bible was reelected in 1956, 1962, and 1968 defeating Republicans Clarence Clifton Young, William B. Wright, and Edward Fike respectively, and represented Nevada in the United States Senate from December 2, 1954, until his resignation on December 17, 1974. He did not run for reelection in 1974; Republican Paul Laxalt defeated Democratic nominee Harry Reid. Bible&#x27;s resignation enabled the governor to appoint Laxalt to fill the vacancy, giving him seniority over other senators elected in 1974. After leaving the Senate, Bible was elected to the Board of Directors of Bally Manufacturing Corporation.

During his time in the United States Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia (Eighty-fifth through Ninetieth Congresses), the Joint Committee on Washington Metropolitan Problems (Eighty-fifth and Eighty-sixth Congresses), and the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Small Business (Ninety-first through Ninety-third Congresses). He is buried in Reno, Nevada.

<doc id="952322" wikidata="Q5387043" url="?curid=952322" title="Eric Margolis (journalist)">
<text>Eric S. Margolis (born 1943) is an American-born journalist and writer. For 27 years, ending in 2010, he was a contributing editor to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; chain of newspapers, writing mainly about the Middle East, South Asia and Islam. He contributed to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; until 2017 and appears frequently on Canadian television broadcasts, as well as on CNN. A multinational, he holds residences in New York, Paris, Toronto and Banff, Alberta, Canada. Margolis inherited Canadian vitamin manufacturer Jamieson Laboratories from his father in 1989 and owned it until 2014, when he sold it to a US private equity firm.

== Biography ==

=== Background ===
Margolis was born in New York City in 1943 to Henry M. Margolis and Nexhmie Zaimi, an American-Albanian. His father was a New York businessman, restaurant owner, theatrical producer and investor, while his mother was a journalist and author. Eric Margolis holds degrees from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, the University of Geneva, Switzerland, and New York University&#x27;s MBA Program.

===Journalism===
Margolis previously wrote a regular column for the &quot;Sun&quot; chain of newspapers in Canada until 2010, and the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; until 2017. He has also written for Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;Dawn&quot; newspaper, an English language Pakistani newspaper, the &quot;Gulf Times&quot; in Qatar, the &quot;Khaleej Times&quot; in Dubai, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The American Conservative&quot;. He appeared regularly on such television outlets as CNN, Fox, CBC, British Sky Broadcasting News, NPR, and CTV. He was a regular guest on TV Ontario&#x27;s &quot;The Agenda&quot; after previously regularly appearing on its predecessor programme &quot;Studio 2&quot;.

He is affiliated with several organizations including International Institute of Strategic Studies in London and the Institute of Regional Studies based in Islamabad, Pakistan.

===Animal rights===
Margolis and his wife Dana have been animal rights activists for several decades. Together they created the charity The Eric S. Margolis Family Foundation which works to prevent animal cruelty and focuses on issues such as factory farming, puppy mills, and elephant poaching. In summer 2019, Margolis donated $16,000 to cover the veterinarian costs of helping a puppy in critical condition that was thrown from a 6th floor condominium balcony in Toronto and was actively involved in the rescue of the elephant Kaavan from the Islamabad Zoo in Pakistan, together with Four Paws International and Free the Wild Foundation.

== Work ==

=== Political views on United States ===
Margolis identifies his politics as &quot;Eisenhower Republican&quot;. Though his domestic political persuasion is moderately conservative (he is an anti-communist and a supporter of capitalism), Margolis&#x27; views on the Middle East are sharply at odds with those of the neoconservatives.

Margolis wrote this about Barack Obama&#x27;s election:Americans did not &quot;liberate&quot; Iraq, but they certainly liberated their own nation last week by sweeping the Republican Party from power. One prays America&#x27;s long nightmare of foreign aggressions, fear, religious extremism, and flirting with neo-fascism is finally at an end.

In a 2009 column, Margolis stated that an American politician he very much admires is Ron Paul. Margolis wrote about Paul:I came to deeply respect and admire Paul&#x27;s courage, honesty, and his refusal to accept special interest money ... In fact, Rep. Paul has been a model of the type of legislators envisaged by America&#x27;s founding fathers: men of high moral standards and intellect dedicated to the nation&#x27;s wellbeing. He reminds me in many ways of the fiercely upright senators of the early Roman Republic.

Margolis has said he rejects the Republican Party of 2010 because of the growing influence of the Tea Party movement, which he says now appeals to the fears and prejudices of its followers.

===Middle East===
Margolis is best known from his coverage of Palestine and Kashmir. Margolis&#x27; mother, Nexhmie Zaimi, was also a journalist who spent a long time in the Middle East documenting the plight of the Palestinians during the 1950s. Her influence, plus Margolis&#x27;s role as a foreign correspondent in the Mideast and travelling with the mujahideen during the Soviet–Afghan War, invested Margolis with a strong interest in the Muslim World. In a January 2009 column entitled &quot;Eradicating Hamas&quot;, Margolis called the Gaza War a &quot;final solution campaign&quot; on the part of Israel, and called Hamas a popular revolutionary movement that had stood up for the rights of Palestinians &quot;ethnically cleansed&quot; in 1948.

===World history===
In a November 2008 book review entitled &quot;Deflating the Churchill Myth&quot;, Margolis in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; endorsed Pat Buchanan&#x27;s book &quot;Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War&quot; as a &quot;powerful new book&quot;. Margolis stated:Buchanan&#x27;s heretical view, and mine, is that the Western democracies should have let Hitler expand his &quot;Reich&quot; eastward until it inevitably went to war with the even more dangerous Soviet Union. Once these despotisms had exhausted themselves, the Western democracies would have been left dominating Europe. The lives of millions of Western civilians and soldiers would have been spared. In a 2009 essay entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Hitler Alone for World War II&quot;, Margolis endorsed the claims of Viktor Suvorov that Operation Barbarossa was a &quot;preventive war&quot; forced on Hitler by an alleged impending Soviet attack, and that it is wrong to give Hitler &quot;total blame&quot; for World War II.

<doc id="952323" wikidata="Q840033" url="?curid=952323" title="Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages">
<text>CELTA is an initial teacher training qualification for teaching English as a second or foreign language (ESL and EFL). It is provided by Cambridge Assessment English through authorised Cambridge English Teaching Qualification centres and can be taken either full-time or part-time. CELTA was developed to be suitable both for those interested in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) and for Teaching English to the Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). The full name of the course was originally the Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults and is still referred to in this way by some course providers. However, in 2011 the qualification title was amended on the Ofqual register to the Cambridge English Level 5 Certificate In Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA) in order to reflect the wider range of students that teachers might have, including younger learners.

CELTA is designed for candidates with little or no previous English language teaching (ELT) experience. It is also taken by candidates with some teaching experience who have received little practical teacher training or who wish to gain internationally recognised qualification. Candidates should have English language skills equivalent to at least C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) or an IELTS score of 7.

CELTA gives equal emphasis to theory and practice. The strong practical element demonstrates to employers that successful candidates have the skills to succeed in the classroom. Courses can be taken full-time or part-time through one of three modes of delivery: fully face-to-face, in a blended format that combines on-line self-study with practical teaching experience, or fully online, with teaching practice and input all being delivered online through a video conferencing platform such as Zoom. A full-time, face-to-face course typically lasts between four and five weeks. CELTA is a continuous assessment course (i.e. participants are assessed throughout the course) leading to a certificate qualification.

Candidates who successfully complete the course can start working in a variety of English language teaching contexts around the world. CELTA is regulated at Level 5 of the Qualifications and Credit Framework for England, Wales and N. Ireland and is suitable for teachers at Foundation and Developing level on the Cambridge English Teaching Framework.
==History==
A certificate course for the teaching of English as a foreign language (TEFL) originated in International House London in 1962 and was run from the 1970s until 1988 by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA). The 100 hour course at International House led to the RSA Preparatory Certificate in Teaching English as a Foreign Language to Adults (RSA PrepCertTEFLA).

In 1988, Cambridge English Language Assessment (then known as the University of Cambridge Local Exam Syndicate or UCLES) reached an agreement with the RSA to take over the running of training courses for teachers of English as a foreign language (TEFL).

The qualification was amended in response to perceived needs, leading to the launch in September 1988 of the CTEFLA (the Certificate in Teaching English as a Foreign Language to Adults). By 1996, the CTEFLA became the RSA/Cambridge CELTA and in 2001 it was known simply as Cambridge CELTA.

In 2011, Cambridge English Language Assessment and IH London co-operated to launch a jointly produced online blended CELTA course: CELTA Online.

==CELTA for teachers of adult learners==
CELTA focuses on teaching adult learners, but many of the skills and techniques apply to teaching young learners as well. Candidates who plan to teach mainly young learners could take the Young Learner Extension to CELTA, after completing Celta until 2010 when Young Learner Extension ceased to exist.

==Course admissions==
CELTA is suitable for candidates who are beginning their career and experienced teachers who have received little practical teacher training or who wish to gain an international certification of their ELT skills. Teachers who already have an initial teacher training qualification, and who have at least one year’s English Language Teaching experience, may be more suited to another qualification such as Delta. CELTA is suitable for teachers at Foundation and Developing level on the Cambridge English Teaching Framework, whereas Delta is designed for teachers at Proficient and Expert levels of the framework.

CELTA applicants are required to have English language skills equivalent to at least level C1 of the CEFR – a standard of English that enables the teaching and understanding of language issues at a range of levels, from beginner to upper-intermediate students.

CELTA applicants should be over the age of 18 and ideally, have a standard of education equivalent to that required for entry into higher education (e.g. high school diploma or A-Levels). Applicants without formal qualifications may be accepted if they can demonstrate that they are likely to complete the course successfully.

Applicants are asked to complete a written task. The task will focus on language awareness and consideration of issues related to teaching English. If the written task demonstrates an appropriate level of English and the potential to develop the skills needed to pass the course, the applicant will be invited to an interview.

The nature of the interview varies from centre to centre. It may be an individual interview or a group interview and may be conducted face-to-face, on the telephone or on Skype. The interview is an opportunity for centres to provide information to candidates, as well as to assess candidates’ potential to successfully complete the course (i.e. candidates will be asked to show how they think about language and learning/teaching English).

The average cost of taking a CELTA course around the world is about USD 2,000.

==Course aims and main features==
CELTA is an initial teacher training qualification designed to help candidates acquire and improve the skills needed for teaching English, with an emphasis on hands-on teaching practice. The official course aims are as follows.

The course enables candidates to:
* Acquire essential subject knowledge and familiarity with the principles of effective teaching
* Acquire a range of practical skills for teaching English to adult learners
* Demonstrate their ability to apply their learning in a real teaching context.

CELTA programmes are designed by individual centres using the syllabus and course aims provided by Cambridge English Language Assessment.

The syllabus consists of five topic areas:
* Topic 1 – Learners and teachers, and the teaching and learning context
* Topic 2 – Language analysis and awareness
* Topic 3 – Language skills: reading, listening, speaking and writing
* Topic 4 – Planning and resources for different teaching contexts
* Topic 5 – Developing teaching skills and professionalism.

The exact nature of the programme will vary from centre to centre. Programmes may also vary year on year to reflect changes in technology and teacher training methodology. However, all courses will have a minimum of 120 contact hours and will include the following components:
* Input
* Supervised lesson planning
* Teaching practice (six assessed hours)
* Feedback on teaching
* Peer observation
* Observation of experienced teachers (minimum six hours)
* Consultation time.

Candidates are expected to dedicate an additional 80 hours for required reading, research, pre- and post-session tasks, assignments and lesson preparation.

==Course syllabus==
The CELTA syllabus consists of five topic areas, which are each assessed through a combination of teaching practice and written assignments. The following section outlines the main content points covered in each topic – the full Learning Outcomes are available in the course syllabus.

Topic 5 is assessed through teaching practice (planning and teaching) and a written assignment focused on classroom teaching and the identification of action points: ‘Lessons from the classroom’.

==Course delivery format==
CELTA courses can be taken full-time or part-time and either face-to-face, online or a combination of these modes (NB: Since the COVID outbreak of 2020, the Teaching Practice component and therefore the entire course, can be taken 100% online). All versions of CELTA give equal emphasis to theory and practice (candidates generally spend half their time learning theory and half their time doing teaching practice). All versions of CELTA lead to the same internationally recognised certificate.

Full-time courses, conducted face-to-face or online by an authorised teaching qualification centre, last four to five weeks (depending on the centre). Part-time courses, conducted face-to-face in an authorised teaching qualification centre, last anything from a few months up to a year.

A directory of global Cambridge English teaching qualification centres and their contact details can be accessed on the Cambridge English Language Assessment website.

===CELTA online blended===
CELTA Online is provided by Cambridge English Language Assessment in partnership with International House, London. It provides a flexible manner of obtaining CELTA by combining online self-study with face-to-face teaching practice. The online materials can be accessed at any time allowing students to plan their course work around other professional / personal commitments.

The online course is conducted over a minimum of ten weeks and maximum of an academic year. Each online course has a minimum of three and a maximum of 24 candidates.

The online self-study units have interactive materials, tasks and discussion forums. Candidates work independently or collaboratively on these tasks with support, evaluation and comment from an online tutor. The teaching practice elements of the course take place at an authorised teaching qualification centre with face-to-face contact. Candidates teach for a total of six hours (spread over a minimum of eight occasions) with peers observing.

==Young Learner (YL) Extension to CELTA (Discontinued)==
The Young Learner (YL) Extension to CELTA was aimed at teachers who had gained the CELTA certificate and wished to build on the content of CELTA to teach young learners (i.e. children and teenagers). The YL Extension to CELTA was normally taught full-time over the course of two weeks.

However, registration for the YL extension was phased out in December 2016. Instead, Cambridge English recommends taking the &quot;TKT: Young Learners&quot; module as an alternative to the YL extension.

==Assessment and results==
CELTA does not have a final exam. It is a continuous assessment course (i.e. participants are assessed throughout the course), which leads to a certificate. An external assessor, appointed by Cambridge English Language Assessment, moderates each course.

Candidates are required to attend their course and fulfil the following course requirements:
* Teach classes of the relevant age group and size, for a total of six hours over at least eight occasions. Candidates will teach classes at two levels of ability (one of which will be lower than intermediate and the other at intermediate level or higher).
* Observe experienced teachers teaching classes of language for a total of six hours (three of which may be via video link), as well as observing other candidates in the practice group
* Submit a portfolio of coursework, including:
** Materials related to teaching practice
** Four written assignments (NB: two assignments can be conflated into one larger assignment if all the assessment criteria are met).

The CELTA certificate is awarded to candidates who meet the course requirements and whose performance meets, or exceeds, the criteria in the two assessment components:
* Teaching Practice (TP) – 6 hours
* Written Assignments – 4 assignments.

Each centre designs their own written assignments. Assignment should be between 750 and 1,000 words and should consist of:
* One assignment focused on the learner and learning contexts
* One assignment focused on an aspect of the English language system
* One assignment focused on an aspect of language skills
* One assignment focused on classroom teaching and the identification of action points.

There are three passing grades: Pass (Grade A), Pass (Grade B), and Pass.

Candidates who fail to meet criteria in any or all assessed components will receive a Fail. The application and interview process is intentionally rigorous to ensure candidates have the potential to pass the course and the failure rate is therefore not high. Candidates who fail will receive a letter confirming the result and an end of course report which states their areas of achievement and areas for further development. In order to pass, candidates will need to re-take the course and meet all the criteria.

==Usage==
CELTA is one of the most widely taken English Language Teaching qualifications with over 316 approved CELTA centres, in over 60 countries, providing over 850 CELTA courses every year.

CELTA is recognised around the world by international English Language Teaching organisations, public bodies, non-governmental organisations, educational institutions, publishers and English Language Teaching quality assurance bodies, including:
* The UK Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual): CELTA is regulated at Level 5 of the Qualifications and Credit Framework for England, Wales and N. Ireland
* IATEFL (the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language)
* TESOL International Association
* TESL Canada
* Languages Canada
*NEAS Australia
* The Irish Department of Education and Skills
* The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI)
* Accreditation and Coordination of English Language Services (ACELS).

International English Language Teaching organisations that recognise CELTA include:
* British Council
* ELS Language Schools.

Higher education institutions that recognise and/or provide CELTA includes universities based in:
* Australia (e.g. University of Queensland)
* Ireland (e.g. University College Cork)
* New Zealand (e.g. University of Auckland)
* UK (e.g. Swansea University, University of Bristol, University of Durham, University College London)
At Swansea University, for example, the CELTA is offered both to external applicants and as an embedded course to undergraduates as part of their studies in the College of Arts and Humanities
* U.S. (e.g. University of Texas.)

==Preparation==
Candidates accepted on to a CELTA course are provided with a reading list of suitable materials and a pre-course task. The pre-course task is an introduction to English language teaching, which provides candidates with information about methodology and language analysis. Additionally, candidates receive access to Cambridge English Teacher where further materials and professional development courses can be accessed.

===Cambridge English Teacher (Discontinued) ===
As of July 2013, all CELTA candidates receive a 1-year membership of Cambridge English Teacher. This has been discontinued since May 2017. However, resources for Teacher Development are available on the Cambridge English website. Cambridge English Teacher provides continuous professional development for English language teachers and is run by two departments of the University of Cambridge: Cambridge English Language Assessment and Cambridge University Press.

It is an online resource that supports career development by providing short courses, webinars with experts, articles and videos, teaching resources, a global network of thousands of teachers, a Jobs Board and a calendar of events (online and face-to-face).

<text>A tumbrel (alternatively tumbril) is a two-wheeled cart or wagon typically designed to be hauled by a single horse or ox. Their original use was for agricultural work; in particular they were associated with carrying manure. Their most infamous use was taking prisoners to the guillotine during the French Revolution. They were also used by the military for hauling supplies. In this use, the carts were sometimes covered. The two wheels allowed the cart to be tilted to discharge its load more easily. Many tumbrels also had hinged for the same reason.

The word is also used as a name for the cucking stool and for a type of balancing scale used in medieval times to check the weight of coins.

<text>Sterling, Virginia, refers most specifically to a census-designated place (CDP) in Loudoun County, Virginia, United States. The population of the CDP as of the 2020 United States Census was 30,337 The CDP boundaries are confined to a relatively small area between Virginia State Route 28 on the west and Virginia State Route 7 on the northeast, excluding areas near SR 606 and the Dulles Town Center.

A much wider region has a preferred mailing address of &quot;Sterling, Virginia&quot;, per the United States Postal Service. Other localities included within this larger area include Arcola, Cascades, Countryside, Dulles, Dulles Town Center, Oak Grove, and Sugarland Run. The &quot;Greater Sterling&quot; region includes part of Washington Dulles International Airport and the former AOL corporate headquarters. Greater Sterling is also home to the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office LWX (serving the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area), as well as the Sterling Field Support Center, the National Weather Service test, research, and evaluation center for weather instruments.

The following includes information covering both the CDP and the wider &quot;Greater Sterling&quot; region.

==History==

In 1962, large farms made up the of what today is called Sterling Park. Route7, also known as Leesburg Pike, bordered what used to be Jesse Hughes&#x27;s dairy farm. Hughes arrived in Loudoun County in the early 20th century and was a longtime head of the county&#x27;s Democrats. Fred Franklin Tavenner, who was somewhat related to Benjamin Franklin, operated vast stretches of Sterling Farm at the southwest fringes of Sterling Park. Tavenner had purchased land from Albert Shaw Jr., who had inherited it from his father Albert B. Shaw, editor and publisher of the American &quot;Review of Reviews&quot;. One of Shaw&#x27;s spreads, totaling , was called &quot;The Experimental Farm&quot; because it was one of the first area farms to receive a U.S. grant for applying &quot;scientific methods&quot;, as Tavenner called them. According to Tavenner, refugees from the Soviet Union ran the farm while Shaw remained in New York City.

Dulles International Airport and the extension of water and sewer lines to the airport began to change the landscape when construction started in 1959. Land prices rose from an average to . During the same year, Marvin T. Broyhill Jr. and his father made plans to develop land in the airport area under the company M.T. Broyhill &amp; Sons Corporation. In late 1961, they decided to buy and incorporated Sterling Park Development Corporation with his son Marvin T. Broyhill as president, and cousin Thomas J. Broyhill as vice president. Between April 28 and December 29 of 1961, they purchased in 14parcels for $2,115,784. For the Hughes farm along Route7, they paid .

M.T. Broyhill &amp; Sons Corporation learned where the right-of-way for Route28 (Sully Road) would be, and hoped to develop Sterling Park on both sides of it, so they would not have to build a road through Sterling Park. However, Powell B. Harrison, who was instrumental in planning Route28, insisted that the road be kept generally free of development, for easy access to the airport. Therefore, the Broyhills developed Sterling Park east of Route28, and had to build their own through road, today&#x27;s Sterling Boulevard.

Marvin Broyhill, Jr.&#x27;s marketing thoughts were to &quot;put together a prefabricated home marketed by U.S. Steel and sell it for about $17,000 $3,000 less than a comparable residence in Fairfax County, Virginia... All homes to have air conditioning. Homeowners to have access without membership fees to golf and tennis courts and pools.&quot; Air conditioning was uncommon in homes of that price range at the time. Broyhill&#x27;s ideas, except for free golf, are realities today. As selling points, Loudoun&#x27;s taxes were less than half of Fairfax&#x27;s taxes, Washington was a half-hour away, and the elder Broyhill had envisioned commuter trains on the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad (which, since 1951, had carried only freight). The railroad tracks were the southern boundary of the present Sterling Park.

Sterling Park residents had to be of the &quot;Caucasian race.&quot; No board member or speaker before the board raised an objection to the clause, a common one in the United States before the 1960s, when discriminatory housing was outlawed by the Fair Housing Act, which was enacted as a follow-up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. No African American family moved into Sterling Park until August 1966, when the illegality of the clause became apparent. By then, the population of &quot;The Park&quot;, as it had come to be known, had reached 5,000.

The Broad Run Bridge and Tollhouse, Vestal&#x27;s Gap Road and Lanesville Historic District, and Arcola Elementary School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Communities==
* Broad Run Farms is a residential area north of Virginia State Route 7 and28 that was founded in 1952. It shares the ZIP code of 20165 which uses &quot;Sterling&quot; or &quot;Potomac Falls&quot; as recommended addresses. As an area much older than the surrounding recent growth, it has features unique to the region, including large lots, highly wooded old-growth trees, a wide variety of housing and a voluntary civic association. The Potomac River forms its northern border, and Broad Run its western. A U.S. Senate lawyer bought the Miskel farm in 1950 and later subdivided it, founding Broad Run Farms. The Civil War Skirmish at Miskel Farm propelled Confederate Captain John S. Mosby to fame. The community banded together in 1995, with state and county help, to finance and install its own sewer service, in part through an added property tax. The lien was paid off several years early and the tax has now been retired.
* Cascades is a planned community within the 20165 ZIP code. The area is located in the northeasternmost part of Loudoun County, between the Fairfax County line to the east, the Potomac River to the north, and Algonkian Parkway to the south. Located just north of Route7, along the Algonkian Parkway, approximately 6500 homes comprise the community.
* Countryside is a housing development in Sterling (20165 ZIP code), bounded by the Potomac River to the north and by Route7 (Leesburg Pike) to the south.

Potomac Falls is also home to three 18-hole golf courses and is home to the Potomac Falls High School Panthers.
* Sterling Park is a portion of Sterling with the ZIP code of 20164. The land where Sterling Park was built was mainly made up of a few very large farms. When construction of Dulles International Airport began in 1959, land prices began to rise. In 1961, Marvin T. Broyhill Sr. saw this as a great investment opportunity and decided to buy the that now make up Sterling Park . Construction of homes priced $14,800 to $22,500 was completed by 1967. Sterling Park was one of the first planned communities built in eastern Loudoun County and was a popular place for government workers to settle with their families outside Washington, D.C. Sterling Park also contains a variety of businesses, churches, parks, a community center, a semi-private golf club with schools, tennis courts, and two swimming pools. It is the home of the Park View High School Patriots.

<text>Horslips are an Irish Celtic rock band that compose, arrange and perform songs frequently inspired by traditional Irish airs, jigs and reels. The group are regarded as &quot;founding fathers of Celtic rock&quot; for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music and went on to inspire many local and international acts. They formed in 1970 and &#x27;retired&#x27; in 1980 for an extended period. The name originated from a spoonerism on The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which became &quot;The Four Poxmen of The Horslypse&quot;.

Although Horslips had limited commercial success when the band was playing in the 1970s, there was a revival of interest in their music in the late 1990s and they came to be regarded as one of the defining bands of the Celtic rock genre. Since that time there have been small-scale reunions, including appearances on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Other Voices&quot;. The band reformed for two Irish shows in the Odyssey Arena in Belfast and the 3Arena in Dublin at the end of 2009, and have continued to play shows since then.

==Band members==
*Jim Lockhart (born 3 February 1948), from James&#x27;s St in Dublin, studied Economics and Politics at University College Dublin. He fell under the influence of Seán Ó Riada, wanting to build an orchestral sound out of Irish music. He plays keyboards, pipes, whistles and flute. He did vocals on a select number of songs, mainly in Manx and Irish.
*Eamon Carr (born 12 November 1948), is from Kells, County Meath. He and Peter Fallon were among the founding members of a poetry and beat performance group called Tara Telephone in Dublin in the late 1960s that also published the quarterly literary journal &quot;Capella&quot;. He is the drummer in the band.
*Charles O&#x27;Connor, (Born 7 September 1948) from Middlesbrough in the UK plays concertina, mandolin, fiddle and both electric and slide guitar. He also shares the main vocal tasks with Barry Devlin and Johnny Fean.
*Barry Devlin (born 27 November 1946), from Ardboe in County Tyrone, once trained as a Columban priest. He left this to study English in University College Dublin and afterwards joined a graphics company as a screenwriter. He is the band&#x27;s bass player, shares vocals, and is its unofficial front man.
*Johnny Fean (17 November 1951 – 28 April 2023) spent his childhood in the city of Limerick and in Shannon, County Clare. He soon mastered guitar, banjo, mandolin and harmonica. In his teens, he played in sessions in Limerick and County Clare. Fean developed his listening tastes from rock to blues and incorporated it into his guitar style. In his late teens he played in a group called Sweet Street, with Joe O&#x27;Donnell on electric fiddle and Eugene Wallace. He later played in Jeremiah Henry, a rock and blues band. His idols were Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. He left Jeremiah Henry in 1970 to play traditional music again in Limerick.

==Original run==

===Formation and line-ups===
Barry Devlin, Eamon Carr and Charles O&#x27;Connor met when they worked at Arks Advertising Agency in Dublin. They were cajoled into pretending to be a band for a Harp Lager commercial but needed a keyboard player. Devlin said he knew a Jim Lockhart who would fit the bill. The four enjoyed the act so much that they decided to try being proper rock performers. They joined guitarist Declan Sinnott, a colleague of Eamon Carr&#x27;s from poetry performance and musical group Tara Telephone and, briefly, Gene Mulvaney, to form Horslips (originally Horslypse) in 1970.

The band went professional on St Patrick&#x27;s Day 1972 having shed Mulvaney and released a single, &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, on their own record label, Oats. Declan Sinnott left soon after, primarily due to his annoyance at the group appearing in an advert for Mirinda orange drink (shot in the grounds of Ardmore Studios, Bray, in Easter 1972). Sinnott was replaced by Gus Guest, who appeared on the group&#x27;s second single &quot;Green Gravel&quot;, but departed shortly thereafter. Johnny Fean then replaced Guest, and the &#x27;classic&#x27; Horslips line-up that would appear on all future releases was set.

===Main career===

====Album approach====
Horslips designed their own artwork, wrote sleeve-notes and researched the legends that they made into concept albums. They established their own record label, Oats, and licensed the recordings through Atco, RCA and DJM for release outside Ireland. They kept their base in Ireland, unlike previous Irish bands.

====First album====
In October 1972, Horslips went to Longfield House in County Tipperary and recorded their first album, &quot;Happy to Meet – Sorry to Part&quot;, in the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. On this first album the melodies were mostly traditional. Jim Lockhart was on keyboards and gradually mastered other instruments including uilleann pipes. Eamon Carr was on drums, including the Irish bodhrán. &quot;Happy To Meet, Sorry To Part&quot; was the fastest-selling album for eight years in Ireland. The sleeve was an elaborate concertina-shaped fold-out design.

====The Táin====
The Abbey Theatre in Dublin asked the band to provide the background for a stage adaptation of &quot;The Táin&quot;. They leapt at the opportunity. &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (The Cattle-Raid of Cooley) is a tenth-century story written in Old and Middle Irish. It tells of an ancient war between Ulster and Connacht. &quot;The Táin&quot; was released in 1973 and had more original material alongside the traditional tunes, and greater emphasis on rock. In the same year a single, &quot;Dearg Doom&quot;, went to number one in Germany.

====Later albums====
&quot;Dancehall Sweethearts&quot; followed in 1974, and also balanced folk with rock. Their fourth album, &quot;The Unfortunate Cup of Tea&quot;, drifted toward pop music and was generally considered less successful. RCA ended their funding deal for the group in 1975. The group funded their next venture themselves and went back to basics. &quot;Drive The Cold Winter Away&quot; (also 1975) was their most traditional album to date. They signed with DJM Records worldwide through A&amp;R man Frank Neilson. &quot;The Book of Invasions: A Celtic Symphony&quot; (1976), like &quot;The Táin&quot;, was an adaptation of Irish legends built into a complex story. It became their only entry in the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 39 in 1977.

====US and later work====
Ever ambitious, the band now tried to make it in the United States. They brought in Jim Slye to become their manager. He later sold their publishing rights to William McBurney for £4,000. In 1977 they produced &quot;Aliens&quot;, about the experience of the Irish in nineteenth-century America. They toured Britain, Germany, Canada and the United States. The night they played the Royal Albert Hall in London was described by one critic as the loudest gig there since Jimi Hendrix. &quot;The Man Who Built America&quot; (1978), produced by Steve Katz of Blood, Sweat and Tears and Blues Project fame, concerned Irish emigration to the US and received considerable airplay but broad approval was missing. The heavier sound did bring some acceptance in America but they lost their folk base and their freshness. 

&quot;Short Stories, Tall Tales&quot; (1979) was their last studio album and was panned by the record company and critics alike.

===&quot;The Last Time&quot;===
At a time when The Troubles were at its peak, Horslips played gigs in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without prejudice and were accepted everywhere. Their last recordings were from live performances at the Whitla Hall in Belfast April and May 1980. A few months later, on 12 October 1980 they played their final gig in the Ulster Hall. They made no public announcement. They simply gave an encore — the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;The Last Time&quot; (this was a reference to the recording studio of their first album) and the final act was Charles O&#x27;Connor throwing his mangled fiddle into the audience. Ten years after they formed, they disbanded.

==Musical life after the break up==
Even before Horslips ended, Johnny Fean, Eamon Carr and two others founded the Zen Alligators in 1980. They played straight rock and soul on the Irish circuit, and they recorded several singles. Another spin-off group called Host contained Fean, O&#x27;Connor and Carr. They issued one album, &quot;Tryal,&quot; in 1984, and two singles.

The final album that had a Fean/Carr collaboration in the 1980s was &quot;The Last Bandits in the World&quot; (1986).

Barry Devlin issued a solo album called &quot;Breaking Star Codes&quot; in 1983 with some help from Jim Lockhart. The album had 12 songs, each based, loosely, on the signs of the zodiac. Further Lockhart/Devlin collaborations included the theme tune to the popular RTÉ drama series &quot;Glenroe&quot;.

In 1986, Johnny Fean moved to England. An English indie band called Jacobites (1983 to 1986) consisted of Nikki Sudden and Dave Kusworth. Their 1986 album &quot;Ragged School&quot; had Johnny on guitar. He also played sporadically with a Horslips tribute band Spirit of Horslips and pub gigs with pick up three-piece The Treat, which sometimes featured former Thin Lizzy guitarist Eric Bell instead of Fean.

In 1990, the electric guitar intro to &quot;Dearg Doom&quot; was used for &quot;Put &#x27;Em Under Pressure&quot;, Ireland&#x27;s 1990 World Cup song, written by Larry Mullen and featuring the Republic of Ireland national football team and Moya Brennan. This use of the intro may be better known in Ireland than the original.

Charles O&#x27;Connor released an instrumental album, &quot;Angel on the Mantelpiece&quot;, in collaboration with Paul Whittaker in 1997.

===Further activities===
* Johnny Fean continued to play live music with Stephen Travers, formerly of The Miami Showband.
* After his retirement, Eamon Carr went on to become a producer of young rock talent in the mid-1980s, and also formed his own record label called Hotwire (which sponsored noted acts such as the punk rock group The Golden Horde). He also did a number of specialist DJ slots on radio before morphing into a music/sports journalist with the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; in Dublin. More recently he presented on a Dublin station &#x27;Carr&#x27;s Cocktail Shack&#x27; in which he played American music of the 1950s and 1960s. In 2008, Carr and Henry McCullough co-wrote a new bunch of songs. A resulting album entitled &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Moon&quot; was released on 1 September 2008. Also in 2008, Carr released his first book, &quot;The Origami Crow, Journey Into Japan, World Cup Summer 2002&quot;, a book that is at once a travel log about his journey to Japan, a poetry collection, an homage to Japanese poet Bashō, and also has some sports commentary thrown in.
* Barry Devlin directed for the screen and been a drama writer for radio and screen, as can be seen from his credits on the IMDB and for the radio detective drama Baldi He produced a number of U2 videos in the mid-1980s. Examples of his screen writing are evident in the joint RTÉ/BBC production &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; and ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot;.
* Jim Lockhart is head of production at RTÉ 2fm and has also done some production work and music arrangement.
* Charles O&#x27;Connor owns two antique shops in Whitby, England. O&#x27;Connor continued to record folk and traditional music in his home recording studio.

==Releases and copyright issues==
For 20 years William McBurney, head of Belfast-based Outlet Records for over 40 years, received royalties from the sales of vinyl and CDs, including many compilations. He claimed that he bought the rights in good faith from Jim Slye, who managed Horslips from the late 1970s until the band&#x27;s final gig. However, the quality of these releases left much to be desired. Shoddy artwork and poor sound meant that most of these releases were sold at bargain prices, leaving the five former band members disillusioned. They fought back and on 7 March 1999 won a court victory in Belfast for copyright ownership and a substantial financial settlement. Horslips are now once again fully in control of their music and they released the entire back catalogue on CD in 2000/2001 with updated artwork and digitally remastered sound.

==Returns==
===First revival: 2004 to 2006===
In March 2004, three Horslips enthusiasts, Jim Nelis, Stephen Ferris and Paul Callaghan, put on an exhibition of Horslips memorabilia in The Orchard Gallery in Derry. It was opened by the band, who played five songs acoustically. Buoyed by this first public appearance in 24 years, Horslips returned to the studio in Westmeath to produce a studio album, &quot;Roll Back,&quot; in the summer of 2004. Described as &quot;Horslips Unplugged&quot;, the album contained acoustic reworkings of many of their best-known songs.

The same exhibition moved to Drogheda in October 2005, courtesy of longtime fan Paddy Goodwin, and was formally opened on 6 October by a tribute band, Horslypse, composed of nine teenage musicians. Horslips did a version of &quot;Furniture&quot;. The exhibition moved to Belfast in February and March 2006 and there were plans for a New York showing in 2007. In February 2008, the exhibition opened in Ballinamore in County Leitrim, and in July it opened in Ballybofey in Donegal.

A double DVD entitled &quot;Return of the Dancehall Sweethearts&quot; came out in November 2005. Disc one is a documentary and disc two was live footage of the band from the 1970s, including promo videos and slots on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;.

In December 2005, the band played in front of an invited audience for the recording of the RTÉ television program &quot;Other Voices&quot; in Dingle in County Kerry. Part of the set included three songs done &quot;full-on&quot; - the first time the band had played live and electric since October 1980.

The last Horslips&#x27; event in this phase of their career was a TG4 tribute show recorded and broadcast live on 25 March 2006 before a live invited studio audience. A number of Irish personalities were interviewed, in Irish, about what the band meant to them and how Horslips shaped modern Irish music.

===2009 reunion to 2012===
On 2 July 2009, it was announced that Horslips would reunite for two shows, their first &#x27;open public&#x27; gigs since 1980. The band played the Odyssey Arena in Belfast on 3 December and the 3Arena in Dublin on 5 December. Drummer Eamon Carr did not play the concerts, citing personal reasons, though he was fully supportive and remains a fifth member. His place was taken by Johnny Fean&#x27;s brother Ray Fean. Recordings from these shows were released on the DVD/CD &#x27;Live at the O2&#x27; in November 2010. The O2 Arena has since been renamed as The 3Arena. The Irish band Something Happens were the support act for the show in The 3Arena.

The band played two invitation-only warm up gigs in McHugh&#x27;s of Drogheda on 26 and 27 November. The band was set to play at &quot;Live at the Marquee&quot; Cork City on 26 June 2010, but the concert was cancelled due to Jim Lockhart falling ill.

In November and December 2010, Horslips, again with Ray Fean on percussion, returned with a four gig tour of Ireland. These included the INEC (Ireland&#x27;s National Event Centre) in Killarney (27 November), the Royal Theatre in Castlebar (28 November), the Waterfront Hall in Belfast (1 December) and culminated in a return to the O2 Arena on 4 December. They played at the 2011 Celtic Connections Festival in Glasgow&#x27;s &quot;Old Fruitmarket&quot; on 18 January. On 10 February 2010, it was announced that Horslips would be special guests under Fairport Convention at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention 2011. They performed on 13 August.

On St Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 2011, the band played a BBC concert with the Ulster Orchestra at Belfast&#x27;s Waterfront Hall. Later in 2011, they played the London Feis festival in Finsbury Park (Saturday 18 and Sunday 19 June), sharing the bill with many other luminaries like Christy Moore, Van Morrison, and Bob Dylan.

====Final concerts====
On 3 June 2012, Horslips performed as the headline act at the Rory Gallagher Tribute Festival in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and on 25 and 26 August, they played two shows in Ireland&#x27;s National Concert Hall with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra.

===Biographical book and album===
On 4 November 2013, Horslips released their biography &quot;Tall Tales&quot;. The book was written by Mark Cunningham and features interviews with the band. A double album featuring all the group&#x27;s singles released outside Ireland, called &quot;Biography&quot;, was also released. On the Summer Solstice (21 June) 2014, Horslips played at Dunluce Castle, near Portrush in Northern Ireland, and in August of that year, they played at Milkmarket in Limerick.

===After Horslips===
On 12 March 2019, two of the band, Barry Devlin and Jim Lockhart, played at an event in the National Concert Hall, Dublin, to commemorate the occupation by radical students of the administration block at University College, Dublin, 50 years before. They joined the house band for the night, made up of members of &quot;Chris Meehan and his Redneck Friends&quot;, along with other well-known musicians, actors and performers who had been involved in the events of 1969, when the building that is now the NCH was part of UCD.

On 11 and 12 May 2019, with Charles retired from music, original members Barry, Johnny and Jim plus Ray Fean (drums) played two concerts at Belfast&#x27;s Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival, at Custom House Square. The shows were promoted as &#x27;Barry Devlin, Johnny Fean &amp; Jim Lockhart from Horslips&#x27;.

Johnny Fean died in April 2023.

<text>Theatre of Blood (U.S. title: Theater of Blood) is a 1973 British horror comedy film directed by Douglas Hickox and starring Vincent Price and Diana Rigg.

==Plot==
After being humiliated by members of the Theatre Critics Guild at an awards ceremony, Shakespearean actor Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart is seen committing suicide by diving into the Thames from a great height. He survives and is rescued by a group of vagrants. Two years later, beginning on the Ides of March, Lionheart sets out to exact vengeance against the critics who failed to acclaim his genius, killing them one by one in ways very similar to murder scenes in the season of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays that he last performed. Before each murder, Lionheart recites the critic&#x27;s damning review of his performance in the role.

The first critic, George Maxwell, is repeatedly stabbed by a mob of murderous homeless people, suggested by the murder of Julius Caesar in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. The second, Hector Snipe, is impaled with a spear, and his body is dragged away to appear at Maxwell&#x27;s funeral tied to a horse&#x27;s tail, replicating the murder of Hector in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. The third, Horace Sprout, is decapitated while sleeping, as is Cloten in &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. The fourth critic, Trevor Dickman, has his heart cut out by Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, the play being rewritten so that Antonio is forced to repay his debt with a pound of flesh. The fifth, Oliver Larding, is drowned in a barrel of wine, as is George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence in &quot;Richard III&quot;.

For the next play, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Lionheart lures the critic Peregrine Devlin to a fencing gymnasium, where he re-enacts the sword fight from the play. He badly wounds Devlin but chooses not to kill him at this juncture. The sixth critic to die, Solomon Psaltery, an obsessively jealous man, murders his wife Maisie, believing her to be unfaithful, as portrayed in &quot;Othello&quot;. Although Psaltery survives, his actions lead to his imprisonment, and he will likely die in prison. The seventh critic to die, Miss Chloe Moon, is electrocuted to replicate the burning of Joan of Arc in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. The eighth critic to die, flamboyant gourmand Meredith Merridew, is force-fed pies made from the flesh of his two toy poodles until he chokes to death, replicating the demise of Queen Tamora in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;.

It is revealed that Lionheart is being aided by his adoring daughter Edwina. She kidnaps Devlin and brings him to the theatre, where Lionheart tells him to give him the award or be blinded with red-hot daggers, as happens to Gloucester in &quot;King Lear&quot;. He refuses, but the contraption meant to blind him gets stuck. Lionheart sets fire to the theatre. In the confusion, one of the vagrants kills Edwina by striking her on the head with the award statuette, unwittingly casting her in the role of Cordelia, Lear&#x27;s youngest daughter. Lionheart retreats, carrying her body to the roof and delivering Lear&#x27;s final monologue before the roof caves in, setting him ablaze and sending him to his death. Devlin, a critic even in the face of death, then gives Lionheart&#x27;s performance a positive if mixed review.

Like other movies in the last years of his life, Hawkins was dubbed by his friend Charles Gray. Both Hawkins and Dennis Price died within a few months of the film&#x27;s release.

==Production==
The film was originally to be titled &quot;Much Ado About Murder&quot;. Robert Fuest, director of &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; (1971) and its sequel &quot;Dr. Phibes Rises Again&quot; (1972), was originally offered this film to direct, but turned it down on the grounds of not wishing to be typed as &quot;the guy who makes Vincent Price theme killing movies.&quot;

Director Douglas Hickox said: &quot;The cast was so good that all I had to do as director was open the dressing room door and let the cameras roll.&quot;

&quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; was filmed entirely on location. Lionheart&#x27;s hideout, the &quot;Burbage Theatre&quot;, was the Putney Hippodrome, which was built in 1906, but had been vacant and dilapidated for more than ten years before it was used in the film. It was demolished in 1975 to make way for housing.

Lionheart&#x27;s tomb is a Sievier family monument in Kensal Green Cemetery, showing a seated man, one hand placed on the head of a woman kneeling in adoration, while the other holds the Bible, its pages opened to a passage from the Gospel of Luke. The monument was altered for the film by substituting plaster masks of Price and Rigg for the real faces, replacing the Bible with a volume of Shakespeare, and adding Lionheart&#x27;s name and dates.

Peregrine Devlin&#x27;s Thames-side apartment is the penthouse flat at Alembic House (now known as Peninsula Heights) on the Albert Embankment. At the time of filming, the property belonged to the actor and film producer Stanley Baker. It is now the London home of novelist and disgraced politician Jeffrey Archer.

When pre-production commenced, Coral Browne insisted that she would wear only clothing designed by Jean Muir. The film&#x27;s costume designer, Michael Baldwin, informed Browne that the budget could not possibly stretch to designer clothing for any of the cast. Baldwin was surprised and angered to get a call from Douglas Hickox after he had had a meeting with Browne, telling him that she could have the dresses she requested, increasing the budget solely to accommodate her demands. Baldwin was further infuriated to discover that Browne kept all the dresses after filming wrapped.

&quot;Young Man Among Roses&quot;, the miniature featured in the introduction and used as the model for the Critics&#x27; Award Statuette, is by the Elizabethan portraitist Nicolas Hilliard.

This film was reportedly a favourite of Vincent Price&#x27;s, as he had always wanted the chance to act in Shakespeare. Before or after each death in the film, Lionheart recites passages of Shakespeare, giving Price an outlet to deliver such speeches as Hamlet&#x27;s third soliloquy (&quot;To be, or not to be, that is the question...&quot;); Mark Antony&#x27;s eulogy for Caesar from &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (&quot;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears...&quot;); &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent...&quot; from the beginning of &quot;Richard III&quot;; and the raving of King Lear after the death of his faithful daughter.

Diana Rigg regarded &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; as her best film.

The film is sometimes considered to be a spoof or homage of &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot;. Similarities with the earlier film include a protagonist who is presumed dead and is seeking revenge; nine intended victims, one of whom works directly with Scotland Yard and survives; themed murders rooted in literature; and a young female sidekick.
==Critical reception==
&quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; maintains an 88% &quot;fresh&quot; approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 40 reviews with the Critics consensus &quot;Deliciously campy and wonderfully funny, &quot;Theater of Blood&quot; features Vincent Price at his melodramatic best.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Although his schematic vengeance invites comparison with that of the Abominable Dr. Phibes, ... Edward Lionheart happily turns out to be a villain of infinitely higher calibre. ... Douglas Hickox&#x27;s direction is fairly adroit: he makes effective use of locations, and a constantly moving camera prevents the brazen theatricality of the whole scheme becoming too overt. He also sustains a reasonable amount of tension by keeping the murders on the level of grand guignol rather than farce; but in order to sustain our interest, it would have been necessary to reserve some surprises for the last third of the film, and here both script and direction begin to flag. The killing of Meredith Merridrew (Robert Morley) by forcing him to eat his pet poodles remains merely unpleasant, though Lionheart has by this time become such a generally sympathetic character that the conventional denouement is both tedious and irritating. Indeed, Price&#x27;s superb antics have so effectively upstaged the other performers that the last remaining critic&#x27;s refusal to alter his original judgment emerges as an act of crass stupidity rather than courage.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;quite possibly the best horror film Vincent Price has ever made. Certainly it affords him the best role he has ever had in the genre. A triumph of witty, stylish Grand Guignol, it allows Price to range richly between humour and pathos.&quot;

==Stage adaptation==
The film was adapted for the stage by the British company Improbable, with Jim Broadbent playing Edward Lionheart and Rachael Stirling (Diana Rigg&#x27;s daughter), playing Lionheart&#x27;s daughter. The play differs from the film in that the critics are from British newspapers, including &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;, and the only set is an abandoned theatre. The play is again set in the 1970s, rather than being updated. Most of the secondary characters were excised, including police, and the number of deaths reduced. The killings based on &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot; are omitted as they would have to take place outside the theatre and rely on secondary characters, such as the critics&#x27; wives. The name of Lionheart&#x27;s daughter is changed from &quot;Edwina&quot; to &quot;Miranda&quot; to enhance the Shakespearean influence. The adaptation ran in London at the National Theatre between May and September 2005 and received mixed reviews.

==Vincent Price and Coral Browne==
Diana Rigg introduced Vincent Price to his future wife Coral Browne during the making of the film. Browne recalled in a television documentary &quot;Caviar to the General&quot; in 1990 that she had not wanted to make &quot;one of those scary Vincent Price movies&quot;, but she was persuaded to take the part of Chloe Moon by her friends Robert Morley and Michael Hordern, acknowledging that the film thus had a very strong cast. Rigg was unaware that Price was married.

<doc id="952355" wikidata="Q7561568" url="?curid=952355" title="Songs of Praise">
<text>Songs of Praise is a BBC Television religious programme that presents Christian hymns, worship songs and inspirational performances in churches of varying denominations from around the UK alongside interviews and stories reflecting how Christian faith is lived out.

The series was first broadcast in October 1961. On that occasion, the venue was the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Cardiff. It is believed to be the longest running series of its genre on television anywhere in the world.

==Presenters and contributors==
Presenters of the show have included Kwame Kwei-Armah, 
Geoffrey Wheeler, Michael Barratt, Cliff Michelmore, Sir Harry Secombe, Alan Titchmarsh, Roger Royle, Debbie Thrower, Bruce Parker, Ian Gall, Martin Bashir, Huw Edwards, Eamonn Holmes, Kenneth Kendall, Josie d&#x27;Arby, Jonathan Edwards, Steve Chalke, David Grant, Bill Turnbull, Sally Magnusson, Diane-Louise Jordan, Connie Fisher and Dan Walker.

Guest presenters have included Sir Cliff Richard, Gavin Peacock, Michael Buerk, Pete Waterman, Ann Widdecombe and Caron Keating. Jonathan Edwards&#x27; departure from the programme in 2007 was notable after he publicly renounced his Christian faith.

The current main presenters are Aled Jones, Katherine Jenkins, Sean Fletcher, Kate Bottley, Brenda Edwards, Claire McCollum, JB Gill, Katie Piper, Laura Wright, Pam Rhodes, Gemma Hunt, James Lusted, YolanDa Brown, and Radzi Chinyanganya.

==Format==
Until a change of format in November 2014, the programme featured congregations from churches and cathedrals singing hymns alongside interviews with people from the church from which the programme was broadcast with a exploration by the presenter of that week&#x27;s theme, all from the same location.

November 2014 saw the programme adopt more of a magazine format. The stated intention was to evolve the series to reflect the wider Christian audience across the country. Music remains at the heart of the series, but is now more varied in style, reflecting the broad range of Christian genres in each programme and across the series; there is no longer a single location where the music and stories come from each week. The series continued to be usually broadcast between 4 and 5pm on Sundays; though as of 2018 onwards, it has generally been broadcast in a lunchtime slot. The new format continues with special programmes marking Easter and Remembrance Sunday as well as the popular two Big Sing programmes from the Royal Albert Hall and the School Choir of the Year contest. The more recent Gospel Choir of the Year began recording in Birmingham Town Hall in 2013 and in 2014 was recorded at The Hackney Empire in London.

The show has included interviews with Tony Blair, Frances Shand Kydd, Alan Ayckbourn and members of the British Royal Family.

==Scheduling==
Until the relaxation of broadcasting hours restrictions in the autumn of 1972, it was regulated by the government under the control of the Postmaster General that all television broadcasting on Sunday evenings from 6:15 pm–7:25 pm should be &quot;closed&quot; and used only for religious programming on both BBC and ITV. Until 1958, no programmes were broadcast during this time slot, until a compromise was reached between the churches and the Postmaster General, where religious programming would be acceptable to air in this time slot to avoid people from not attending Sunday evening church services. It was under these restrictions and regulations that &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; was created.

At its inception in October 1961, the programme was broadcast at 6:15 pm. From September 1962, it moved to 6:50 pm and then to 6:40 pm from April 1977 with a daytime repeat, generally shown on the following day with BSL. Religious programming was also broadcast on ITV in the same time slot, but this custom ended in late December 1992. From January 1993, the programme&#x27;s scheduled broadcast time was changed to 6:25 pm and then 6:10 pm from January 1996. Since then, the time of broadcast has tended to shift slightly earlier, but the precise slot has often varied from week to week. As of January 2021, the programme has now been placed in a new permanent lunchtime slot on a Sunday, after the Sunday lunchtime news, usually scheduled at 1.15pm.

For many years, the series was replaced during the summer months by other Christian-themed programming. From 1977 until 1993, a selection of hymns from the previous year&#x27;s shows, linked by Thora Hird reading requests and dedications, was featured in &quot;Your Songs of Praise Choice&quot;, which changed its name to &quot;Praise Be!&quot; in 1984. Other summer replacements included &quot;Home on Sunday&quot; (1980–88) and &quot;Sweet Inspiration&quot; (1993–94).

==Events==

Events have included a 3 October 1982 broadcast from Strangeways Prison (the first time it had broadcast from a prison), a 2 January 1983 broadcast from the Falkland Islands, and a broadcast from St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York.

A competition was held in honour of the 20th anniversary in which people submitted newly written hymns. Fifteen winners were published in a book &quot;New Songs of Praise I&quot;.

The programme staged its largest event at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on the first Sunday of 2000. A live audience of over 60,000 people came to sing hymns, with a 6,000 piece choir, an orchestra of 100 harps, the band of the Welsh Guards and an anthem specially written by Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber. The programme was produced by John Forrest. Ian Bradley said the event had a &quot;wonderful vulgarity&quot; but that it also had an &quot;infectious sense of community&quot;

Each year since 2003, three consecutive weeks of the programme (usually in April) have been devoted to the School Choir of the Year competition – the first two weeks being semi-finals featuring junior and senior school choirs respectively, with the final of both categories in the third week.

In order to cut costs, the Easter 2007 edition of the show was recorded at the same time as the Christmas 2006 edition of the show at Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire – with simple changes in lighting and flowers to reflect the two major services. The Bishop of Lichfield Jonathan Gledhill, said the early recording was not a &quot;deliberate deceit&quot; but would give &quot;an air of unreality&quot; to the Easter programme, while a BBC spokeswoman said it was &quot;common practice&quot; to film two shows at once due to the costs in setting up lighting rigs, especially in a large cathedral.

The 16 August 2015 broadcast, filmed at an Ethiopian Orthodox church in the Calais jungle, received criticism from the media including the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, who stated the BBC was &quot;out of touch&quot; and that the show had &quot;political propaganda&quot;. In response, the Anglican Bishop of Leeds Nick Baines and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby defended the BBC&#x27;s decision as reflecting the Church&#x27;s teachings on poverty. Meanwhile, the Reverend Steve Chalke, former &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; presenter and well-known Christian social activist, wrote: 

==Reception and impact==

In the early 1990s, the weekly reach of the show was about 25% of the British population. In 1998, the average viewership was between 5 and 6 million. Because of the long-time transmission of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; following the Sunday evening news, the time slot has become known as the &quot;God slot&quot;. The show has been accused of &quot;abandon[ing] its long-standing commitment to straightforward hymns and &#x27;ordinary&#x27; people talking about their often very extraordinary lives and faith and becoming increasingly obsessed with celebrities and soft-focus schmaltz&quot;.

The show featured in episodes of the BBC comedy television series &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;.

The show is also broadcast in Australia on the ABC at 11:30am on Sundays, and in the Netherlands on NPO 2 at 12pm, also on Sundays.

==Competitive tender==
In 2016, as part of their new charter agreement, the BBC announced that they would put all their programmes which were due for recommission out to competitive tender over an 11-year period, with independent companies invited to bid to make the shows, although the BBC would retain all interstitial property rights. &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; was the first programme to go through this process with BBC Studios winning the commission and retaining the rights to make the show in house. &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; followed shortly after but on 10 March 2017 it was announced that the tender had been won by two independent production companies: Avanti Media based in Cardiff and Nine Lives Media located in Manchester who would be producing the show for the next three years as a co-production. Avanti Media also produced its Welsh-language originator from 2006 until 2017 when its production tender was won by Rondo Media (a company which also produces Welsh soap opera ).

In May 2022, Avanti and Nine Lives announced they would not renew their tender deal to produce the series, with the BBC announcing that they would look for a new company to produce the show beginning in June 2023. On 31 March 2023, CTVC were announced as the winners.

<text>Matthew Eliot Hemingway (born October 24, 1972) is a retired American track and field athlete. He won a silver medal in the high jump at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens by clearing a height of 2.34 meters (7 ft 8 in). Reflecting on this he said: &quot;I&#x27;m ecstatic about winning the silver. You don&#x27;t lose gold medals. People win them. I won a silver and Stefan Holm won a gold.&quot; His personal best jump came at the 2000 US Indoor Championship where he leaped 2.38 m (7 ft 9 in). He jumped off of his left leg.

Hemingway is 6 ft 7 in (or 2.01 m) tall and during his career weighed approximately 185 lb (or 84 kg). He originally is from Buena Vista, Colorado and graduated the University of Arkansas in 1996. His best college performance was a second-place finish at the 1996 NCAA Outdoor Championships.

He came eighth at the 1991 U.S. Junior Championships and jumped 7 ft 4 in. In 1993 he placed 8th at the NCAA Outdoors and was 15th in qualifying at USA Outdoors with a jump of 7 ft 4.5 in. He was fourth at the collegiate SEC Outdoors in 1994. In 1995 he was third at the NCAA Outdoors, second at the SEC Outdoors and 12th (a tie) at USA Outdoors. His year&#x27;s best was a jump of 7 ft 4.5 in. In his senior year, 1996, he finished third at the Southeastern Conference championships, but then earned 2nd place at the NCAA Outdoors championships. At the 1996 USA Olympic Trials he earned first alternate position for the US Olympic Team by placing fourth. He finished the 1996 season ranked fifth in U.S., with a best jump of 7 ft 6.5 in.

His first year out of school was disappointing, with a best of only 7&#x27; 3&quot; (set indoors) followed by a tenth-place finish at the 1997 USA Outdoors championships. Saying he was burnt out and that jumping was no longer fun, Hemingway sat out for two years and worked as a white water rafting guide in Colorado in 1998 and 1999, marrying his Arkansas college sweetheart, Kate, in 1998. He then returned to competition in a big way in 2000.

==USA Championship Meet Record Indoors==
He returned to jumping during the 2000 indoor season and won the US Indoor Championship with his personal best jump of 2.38 m (7 ft 9 in). The meet was held in Atlanta, and Hemingway easily defeated Charles Austin and Jeremy Fischer, who could clear only 2.27. Hemingway&#x27;s 2.38 was not only a personal best, it was also a new Indoor Championship Meet Record and the highest indoor jump in the world that year. At the 2000 USA Olympic Trials he had a very poor meet, finishing tenth with a jump of only 7&#x27; 1.5 (2.17m)- a height at which he would normally begin competing.

A stress fracture in his jumping foot stopped him from competing through the following year. He made a comeback in 2002 and was second at the USA Outdoors. He had a great, early start to the 2003 outdoor season, establishing a new personal (outdoor) best of 2.34 (7&#x27; 8.25&quot;) at the Modesto Relays in Modesto, California on 10 May. He repeated his 2nd-place finish at 2003 USA championships, and placed 13th at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics.

==2004 Athens Olympics==
In 2004, at the (relatively advanced) age of 31, he finally earned a place on the US Olympic Team with a jump of 2.30 (7 ft 6.5 in) in the Trials. At the Olympics in Athens, he easily cleared the (automatic) qualifying height of 2.20 to reach the finals. In the finals on 22 August, Hemingway began jumping at 2.20 and was perfect (no misses) through 2.34. Four men cleared that height, including American teammate Jamie Nieto. As the bar was raised 2 centimeters to 2.36, Hemingway was in first place by virtue of being the only jumper with a perfect record. But when Sweden&#x27;s Stefan Holm was the only jumper to scale 2.36, Hemingway was awarded the silver and Jaroslav Baba took the bronze (because of two misses at 2.32). For Hemingway, the 2.34 matched his personal best outdoors.

==Personal life==
He is related to the famous writer Ernest Hemingway. Along with his wife, he has adopted one Ethiopian child and plan to adopt another. In the future, he and his wife plan to adopt a couple of other children. Hemingway and his wife appeared in the episode &quot;Making Room&quot; (season 3, episode 3) of the HGTV television show &quot;Carter Can&quot; with Carter Oosterhouse. The show highlights their attempt to make room for their first adopted child.

Matt also works as a guide for whitewater rafting company Noah&#x27;s Ark Whitewater Rafting and Adventure in Buena Vista, CO close to where he grew up. In the past Matt worked as manager for a cellular phone store, technical engineer for a wireless carrier (he worked full-time while training for a chance at the Olympics). As of 2006, Hemingway leads a department at the InterActive Corporation (IAC)-owned online home improvement advertiser ServiceMagic in Golden, Colorado. Currently not working at ServiceMagic

<doc id="952401" wikidata="Q1439278" url="?curid=952401" title="Forum shopping">
<text>Forum shopping is a colloquial term for the practice of litigants taking actions to have their legal case heard in the court they believe is most likely to provide a favorable judgment. Some jurisdictions have, for example, become known as &quot;plaintiff-friendly&quot; and thus have attracted plaintiffs to file new cases there, even if there is little or no connection between the legal issues and the jurisdiction.

The term became more widely used as a result of legal developments that expanded the number of available forums for litigants to bring cases, thus allowing litigants to effectively &quot;shop&quot; for the forum they believe will provide the best outcome. For example, in &quot;International Shoe Co. v. Washington&quot; (1945), the U.S. Supreme Court expanded the concept of personal jurisdiction to allow courts to hear disputes over defendants who had only &#x27;minimum contacts&#x27; with its jurisdiction. Foreign litigants were also attracted to file suits in the United States due to a perception that it had a more favorable litigation climate. Other examples include the United Kingdom, which offers stricter defamation laws and generous divorce settlements.

The term &quot;forum shopping&quot; has taken on a negative connotation amongst some who view it as gamesmanship and manipulation that undermines the legitimacy of the judicial system, in order to obtain an unfair advantage. On the other side, some believe forum shopping is not inherently bad or evil, but merely the natural consequence of litigants being able to select from a number of potential forums to bring a case, and thus naturally selecting the forum they think will provide the most favorable outcome. For example, U.S. District Court Judge Sam B. Hall Jr., of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, stated in 1993 that &quot;[i]in reality, every litigant who files a lawsuit engages in forum shopping when he chooses a place to file suit.&quot; The term has also become adopted in a wider context for the activity of repeatedly seeking a venue for a concern, complaint, or action, until the most favorable venue is obtained.

== Related notions ==
When a case is filed before a court, the court decides whether it has personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and if so, whether it is the most appropriate forum or venue. Under the doctrine of &quot;forum non conveniens&quot;, Latin for &quot;inappropriate forum&quot;, a judge has a discretion to transfer a case if the court selected is not the most convenient one. If the courts in two states would accept civil jurisdiction, the plaintiff must be able to show that justice requires the trial to take place in the forum suggested by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff might have selected one forum on the following grounds:
*The forum is not convenient to the defendant or his witnesses. There may be problems of expense of travel, health, or visa or entry permit.
*The court, the judge, or the law is most likely to favour the plaintiff&#x27;s case.

The defendant may take the following actions to seek a change of venue:
*The defendant may petition the forum court that it should reject the jurisdiction and petition to transfer the case to an allegedly more convenient forum; or
*If a case has been filed in another jurisdiction, the defendant may seek injunctive relief against the plaintiff in a second state, requiring that the plaintiff discontinue the action in the first forum and instead submit the case for hearing in this allegedly more convenient forum.

In both instances, the first step is to determine whether the first instance forum is the natural forum, or whether the forum has the closest connection with the action and the parties. The court adjudicates whether there is another forum that is more appropriate under the doctrine of comity. The current forum court must respect the right of a foreign court to assume jurisdiction. A court must balance the interests of the parties, since there is injustice not only when a plaintiff is allowed to pursue the action in a forum inconvenient to the defendant, but also when a plaintiff is not allowed a timely trial.

Generally, the court will not grant a petition to transfer or an injunction if the grant unjustly will deprive the plaintiff of advantages in the first instance forum. Nevertheless, a real and substantial connection between the venue and the cause(s) of action should exist to provide defendants some protection against being pursued in jurisdictions that have little or no connection with the transaction or the parties.

If the alternative court concludes that another court has assumed jurisdiction either without considering whether an alternative forum was available or has reached an obviously unreasonable conclusion on the merits, then an injunction would sometimes be a reasonable response. If, on the other hand, the alternative court has reasonably concluded that no more convenient forum was available, then comity requires it to respect the decision of the court that has already assumed jurisdiction and dismiss the application for an injunction and transfer. In cases where there is a sound argument to be made in favour of both courts, the court in the second venue should not arbitrarily claim a better right to decide for both jurisdictions. In most cases the adherence of the foreign court to principles resembling those applied in the second venue court will be obvious; if the foreign court has adhered, then the second venue court should refuse relief. International family lawyers work to assist their clients in that process.

== Child custody ==
In one case, a court expressly acknowledged that the plaintiff had chosen to move to the state in order to benefit from the liberal divorce laws in that state. The court found that was perfectly appropriate and did not justify a stay or dismissal of the case.

On the other hand, forum shopping is generally seen as particularly inappropriate when it is intended to secure a more sympathetic forum in a child custody case. Indeed, courts have found that the Hague Abduction Convention was designed to deter parents from engaging in international forum shopping in custody cases. Specifically, the Hague Convention attempts to prevent situations in which a parent dissatisfied with current custodial arrangements flees with the child to another country to re-litigate the merits of custody and to obtain a more favorable custody order.

Nonetheless, it may well be in the best interests of a child to remove the child from a forum which does not apply the best interests test in child custody cases to a forum which has a &quot;better&quot; law and practice in such cases.

&quot;There is often a legal vacuum that encourages one parent to take children away from the other, and to deprive the children of access to the other parent,&quot; Morley says. &quot;It not only hurts foreign parents if the Chinese partner takes the child to China, it also hurts Chinese parents living in China because if the other parent takes their child to a foreign country from China, the courts in that foreign country are unable to order the child&#x27;s return to China under the terms of the convention.&quot;

== United States ==
The United States has attracted foreign litigants wishing to take advantage of the more generous awards of damages and alimony, extensive discovery rules, and the contingent fee system. In addition, the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, the Alien Tort Claims Act, and many state product liability laws create legal rights that often do not exist in other jurisdictions.

=== By the plaintiff ===
A plaintiff frequently can choose to file his case in one of several jurisdictions by picking a federal rather than a local jurisdiction, a local rather than federal jurisdiction, or one of several geographic localities. A defendant in a civil case can be sued in a jurisdiction where the defendant resides, or where there are sufficient contacts between the cause of action and the jurisdiction. In the United States, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall, Texas, had become a popular forum for patent lawsuits, and cases filed there resolved favorably for the plaintiff 78% of the time; the national average was 59%. More recently, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in Waco, Texas, became an exceedingly popular forum for patent litigation. All patent infringement cases filed in Waco, Texas, were assigned to the same judge (Alan Albright), who attracted almost 25% of all patent infringement case filings in the United States as of 2022. This concentration of patent cases before a single judge and court led to rule changes in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, requiring that new patent infringement cases filed in Waco, Texas, be randomly assigned across the 12 judges in that district.

=== By the civil defendant ===
A defendant can resort to various procedures or theories to have a case removed from the court wherein the plaintiff originally filed it. The defendant may invoke the removal jurisdiction of a federal court to take a claim out of the state court, request for a change of venue because the case was brought in the improper or inconvenient court within the jurisdiction, and move for &quot;forum non conveniens&quot; on the ground that the case was brought in an inappropriate forum based on the locations of the parties or evidence.

=== In criminal cases ===
Forum shopping also happens, albeit less frequently, in U.S. federal criminal trials, especially as certain districts and circuits are widely thought to favor the government in particular issues or trials. It is often claimed that the trials of domestic and foreign terrorists in the United States were forum shopped. For example, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo were arrested in Maryland in 2002 for a series of spree killings that occurred in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia, but U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft chose to hand them over to Virginia for prosecutions, in part, because it was perceived Virginia was more likely impose a sentence of execution for Muhammad.

Criminal defendants have much less power to change the forum in which the case against them has been brought. Generally, they can do so only where they can show that localized notoriety or publicity makes it unlikely that an impartial jury can be selected in the district in which charges were brought.

=== Efforts to discourage forum shopping ===
While the plaintiff commencing the litigation is generally considered the master of their own complaint, courts may object to forum shopping for several reasons. The fair resolution of a case hinging on technical differences from one jurisdiction to the next would offend the sense of justice, and more practically, judges may fear that having the reputation of a forum favorable to certain types of plaintiffs will delay the timely dispensation of justice in other cases by increasing their workload.

Under the &quot;Erie&quot; doctrine, a federal court hearing a case under the diversity jurisdiction must apply the law of the state in which the court is sitting. When a case has connection to more than just a single state, the forum state&#x27;s choice of law principles generally guide the selection of what place&#x27;s law will apply.

Parties to a contract may seek to prevent forum shopping by inserting a forum selection clause or a choice of law clause in their contract. Such clauses are now generally enforced by the courts.

In June 2023, Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker signed a bill intended to discourage forum shopping by requiring that any lawsuits challenging the constitutionally of a state law be filed in one of the state&#x27;s two largest counties, Cook and Sangamon.

In March 2024, the Judicial Conference of the United States announced a policy against &quot;judge shopping&quot; for cases seeking a nationwide injunction or related relief. &quot;Judge shopping&quot; in this context refers to forum shopping in which a litigant files in a local division of a district court where one or two judges are assigned nearly all cases (such as the Amarillo division of the Northern District of Texas or the Waco division of the Western District of Texas) rather than in a larger division with multiple judges. Under the new policy, the Judicial Conference said that district courts should randomly assign any civil case seeking nationwide or statewide relief to any judge within the district. But the Judicial Conference policy is merely a recommendation and is not binding; on March 29, 2024, the Northern District of Texas, home to two judges frequently sought out by conservative litigants, announced that it would not adopt the Judicial Conference&#x27;s recommendations.

== Philippines ==
Forum shopping is considered a serious offense which can be made by a complainant. The law in the Philippines explicitly prohibits the filing of more than one case for the same cause of action in any forum or court of law so that the courts will not be clogged by complaints of people who may file more than one complaint in an effort to gain a favorable decision in any of the numerous cases filed.

== England and Wales ==

In England and Welsh law, laws on libel can be considered to be more favourable to the plaintiff than in other jurisdictions, leading to a form of forum shopping sometimes called &quot;defamation shopping&quot; or &quot;libel tourism&quot;.

In &quot;The Atlantic Star&quot;, Lord Denning MR famously stated:

== In international relations ==

In international relations (IR) theory, the term &#x27;forum shopping&#x27; describes the situation where a state is member of two or more different international- or regional organizations which deal with the same policy area (overlapping regionalism) so the state can choose the forum (organization) for addressing a certain issue which serves its interests best. This is particularly important in international trade and in security issues.

<doc id="952406" wikidata="Q1369749" url="?curid=952406" title="Rupert Julian">
<text>Rupert Julian (born Thomas Percival Hayes; 25 January 1879 – 27 December 1943) was a New Zealand cinema actor, director, writer and producer. During his career, Julian directed 60 films and acted in over 90 films. He is best remembered for directing Lon Chaney in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925). He also directed &quot;The Cat Creeps&quot; (1930), a sound remake of &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1927), which is now considered a lost film, with only two minutes of footage remaining in the 1932 Universal comedy short film &quot;Boo!&quot;.

==Early years==
Julian was born Thomas Percival Hayes in Whangaroa, New Zealand, son of John Daly Hayes (Jr) and Eliza Harriet Hayes. His father was a rancher who raised cattle and sheep.

Julian&#x27;s parents had him educated in preparation for becoming a Roman Catholic priest, but he went his own way. He volunteered to serve in the British army during the Boer War, and during his two years&#x27; service he was captured twice. The first time, he was exchanged, and the second time he escaped. By the time he left the military he was a lieutenant. He also worked as a sailor, a tea salesman, and engineer of a donkey engine.

== Career ==
Julian became an actor when he was 16. He performed on stage in his native country and Australia before emigrating to the United States in 1911, where he started his career as an actor at the Daly Theatre in New York and touring with Tyrone Power, Sr., and then worked in silent movies. He turned to directing in 1914, often directing his wife Elsie Jane Wilson (also a director), and earned a substantial sum for his film &quot;The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin&quot;, which he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the title role. This made him a star in Hollywood at the time and opened doors to larger projects with Universal Studios.

He was assigned to complete &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; in 1923 when director Erich von Stroheim was fired from it. In 1924, he directed Lon Chaney in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, but left the production shortly before it was released. The studio hired another director to complete the filming and changed the ending. Julian moved to Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s Producers Distributing Corporation for a series of films, but after directing &quot;The Cat Creeps&quot; and &quot;Love Comes Along&quot; (both in 1930), his career faded.

== Death ==
On 27 December 1943, Julian died at his home in Hollywood, California, at the age of 64. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, in 1943. His wife Elsie died in 1965.

<doc id="952407" wikidata="Q1931170" url="?curid=952407" title="Long take">
<text>In filmmaking, a long take (also called a continuous take, continuous shot, or oner) is shot with a duration much longer than the conventional editing pace either of the film itself or of films in general. Significant camera movement and elaborate blocking are often elements in long takes, but not necessarily so. The term &quot;long take&quot; should not be confused with the term &quot;long shot&quot;, which refers to the use of a wide-angle lens and not to the duration of the take. The length of a long take was originally limited to how much film the magazine of a motion picture camera could hold, but the advent of digital video has considerably lengthened the maximum potential length of a take.

==Early examples==

When filming &quot;Rope&quot; (1948), Alfred Hitchcock intended for the film to have the effect of one long continuous take, but the camera magazines available could hold not more than 1000 feet of 35 mm film. As a result, each take uses up to a whole roll of film and lasts up to 10 minutes. Many takes end with a dolly shot to a featureless surface (such as the back of a character&#x27;s jacket), with the following take beginning at the same point by zooming out. The entire film consists of only 11 shots.

Andy Warhol and collaborating avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas shot a 485-minute-long experimental film, &quot;Empire&quot; (1965), on 10 rolls of film using an Auricon camera via 16 mm film, which allowed longer takes than its 35 mm counterpart. &quot;The camera took a 1,200 ft roll of film that would shoot for roughly 33 minutes.&quot;

==Later examples==
A handful of theatrically released feature films, such as &quot;Timecode&quot; (2000), &quot;Russian Ark&quot; (2002), &quot;PVC-1&quot; (2007), &quot;Victoria&quot; (2015) and &quot;Boiling Point&quot; (2021) are filmed in one single take. Others are composed entirely of a series of long takes, while many more may be well known for one or two specific long takes within otherwise more conventionally edited films. In 2012, the art collective The Hut Project produced &quot;The Look of Performance&quot;, a digital film shot in a single 360° take lasting 3 hours, 33 minutes and 8 seconds. The film was shot at 50 frames per second, meaning the final exhibited work lasts 7 hours, 6 minutes and 17 seconds.

Another example from television can be seen in the first season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Detective&quot;. In episode four, &quot;Who Goes There&quot;, protagonist Detective Rustin Cohle (portrayed by Matthew McConaughey) is undercover as part of a biker gang who have decided to brazenly rob a drug den located in a dangerous neighborhood. The shot begins with the bikers arriving at the drug den with McConaughey&#x27;s character reluctantly in tow. The six-minute shot moves in and out of various residences, through several blocks and over a fence, while shots are fired by shouting gangsters, bikers and police as they arrive on the scene. McConaughey at first assists the biker gang, then turns on them to abduct the leader, dragging him along for more than half of the continuous shot. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga commented to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;We required the involvement of every single department, like a live theatre show. We had make-up artists hiding in houses so they could dash out and put make-up on [Cohle&#x27;s hostage] Ginger&#x27;s head. We panned away for a second to do that. We also had ADs peppered around the neighborhood with extras who had specific things to yell and specific places to run. We had stunt guys coordinating with stunt drivers to pull up at the right time, special-effects guys outside throwing foam bricks and firing live rounds.&quot;

The &quot;John Wick&quot; series of films are known for their long-take fight scenes. This was due to the budgetary constraints of using only a single high-end camera for all the filming, and required close choreography with the various extras involved in the fights, who had to run behind the camera after being among the first fallen attackers to come in again as new attackers.

In 2010, artist engineer Jeff Lieberman co-directed a 4-minute music video with Eric Gunther, featuring the indie band OK Go performing their song &quot;End Love&quot;. The video was shot in a continuous take using three cameras, running 18 hours from before sunset to 11 am the following day. The footage was condensed using time-lapse techniques ranging up to 170,000 times speedup, with some brief slow-motion segments also recorded at 1500 frames per second.

==Sequence shot==

A sequence shot is a shot, a long take, that includes a full narrative sequence containing the full scene in its duration, meaning different locations or different time periods. The term is usually used to refer to shots that constitute an entire scene. Such a shot may involve sophisticated camera movement. It is sometimes called by the French term &quot;plan-séquence&quot;. The use of the sequence shot allows for realistic or dramatically significant background and middle ground activity. Actors range about the set transacting their business while the camera shifts focus from one plane of depth to another and back again. Significant off-frame action is often followed with a moving camera, characteristically through a series of pans within a single continuous shot.

An example of this is the &quot;Copacabana shot&quot; featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990), in which Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) takes his girlfriend to a nightclub passing through the kitchen.

Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) opens with an elaborately choreographed eight-minute shot that follows multiple characters in multiple locations, both inside and outside. Among the 17 scenes that comprise the shot, one character refers to the four-minute shot that opens Orson Welles’ &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958).

Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; (1999) ends with a five-minute continuous shot. The Dardenne brothers also shot long sequences for &quot;Two Days, One Night&quot; (2014), some of them consisting of ten minutes.

==Continuous-shot full feature films==
A &quot;one-shot feature film&quot; (also called &quot;continuous-shot feature film&quot;) is a full-length movie filmed in one long take by a single camera, or manufactured to give the impression that it was. Given the extreme difficulty of the exercise and the technical requirements for a long lasting continuous shot, such full feature films have only been possible since the advent of digital movie cameras.

<text>Ronald Arthur Silver (July 2, 1946 – March 15, 2009) was an American actor, director, producer, radio host, and activist. As an actor, he portrayed Henry Kissinger, Alan Dershowitz and Angelo Dundee. He was awarded a Tony in 1988 for Best Actor for &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot;, a satirical dissection of the American movie business, and was nominated for an Emmy for his recurring role as political strategist Bruno Gianelli in &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

==Early life==
Silver was born on July 2, 1946, in Manhattan, the son of May (&quot;née&quot; Zimelman), a substitute teacher, and Irving Roy Silver, a clothing sales executive. Silver was raised Jewish on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and attended Stuyvesant High School.

Silver went on to graduate from the State University of New York at Buffalo, with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and Chinese, and received a master&#x27;s degree in Chinese History from St. John&#x27;s University in New York and the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan. He also attended Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of International Affairs (SIPA) and studied acting at the Herbert Berghof Studio, and later at The Actors Studio. As a student he was exempt from the Vietnam War draft.

==Career==
Silver got his big acting break starring in &quot;El Grande de Coca-Cola&quot; in 1974. Producers Richard Flanzer and Roy Silver (no relation) opened it at the famed Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. The production ran for more than a year. Silver and his co-star, actor Jeff Goldblum, were discovered by Hollywood film agents during this show&#x27;s run.

In 1976, he made his film debut in &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot;, and also played a placekicker in the football comedy film &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;. From 1976 to 1978, he had a recurring role as Gary Levy in the sitcom &quot;Rhoda&quot;, a spinoff from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. Additional screen roles include psychiatrists in the Chuck Norris film &quot;Silent Rage&quot; and in the horror story &quot;The Entity&quot; (1983), the devoted son of Anne Bancroft in &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; (1984), an incompetent detective in &quot;Eat and Run&quot; (1986), the pistol-wielding psychopath stalking Jamie Lee Curtis in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Blue Steel&quot;, and the lead in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;Enemies: A Love Story&quot; (1989).

He starred as Jerry Lewis&#x27;s character&#x27;s son in the multi-episode &quot;Garment District Arc&quot; of the television crime series &quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1988).

He portrayed two well-known attorneys in films based on actual events, playing defense attorney Alan Dershowitz in the drama &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; (1990), based on the trial of Claus von Bülow and defense attorney Robert Shapiro in the television film &quot;American Tragedy&quot; (2000), the story of the O. J. Simpson trial.

From 1991 to 2000, Silver served as president of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association. He played a film producer in &quot;Best Friends&quot; opposite Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn (1982), an actor in &quot;Lovesick&quot; (1983) and a film director in &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; (1992). Silver portrayed a corrupt, rogue senator in the 1994 Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi thriller &quot;Timecop&quot;.

On television in 1998, he starred opposite Kirstie Alley in season two of her TV comedy series &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot;.

In other films based on true stories, Silver portrayed tennis player Bobby Riggs in the TV docudrama &quot;When Billie Beat Bobby&quot; (2001), about Riggs&#x27; real-life exhibition tennis match against Billie Jean King, which Riggs lost. He was also featured as Muhammad Ali&#x27;s boxing trainer and cornerman Angelo Dundee in Michael Mann&#x27;s 2001 biopic &quot;Ali&quot;.

From 2001 to 2002 and again from 2005 to 2006, he had a recurring role as presidential campaign adviser Bruno Gianelli on the NBC series &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

Silver provided the narration for the 2004 political documentary film &quot;FahrenHYPE 9/11&quot; that was produced as a conservative political response to the award-winning and controversial Michael Moore documentary film, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

Silver also narrated a MEMRI documentary film about the Arab and Iranian reactions to the September 11 attacks called &quot;The Arab and Iranian Reaction to 911: Five Years Later.&quot;

Additionally, Silver narrated the audiobook versions of several Philip Roth novels, including &quot;American Pastoral,&quot; &quot;The Plot Against America,&quot; and &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;.

One of his final film performances was as a judge in another true story, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Find Me Guilty&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Vin Diesel.

In February 2008, Silver began hosting &quot;The Ron Silver Show&quot; on Sirius Satellite Radio, which focused on politics and public affairs.

==Personal life==
Silver traveled to more than 30 countries and spoke fluent Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. He taught at the high school level and was a social worker for the Department of Social Services.

In 1975 he married Lynne Miller, a social worker who later became a &quot;Self&quot; magazine editor. The couple had two children; they divorced in 1997. 
In 1989, he co-founded the Creative Coalition, an entertainment industry political advocacy organization that champions First Amendment rights, public education, and support for the arts.

===Politics===
Silver was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2000, he co-founded the organization One Jerusalem to oppose the Oslo Peace Agreement and to maintain &quot;a united Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel&quot;.

Silver, who had been a lifelong Democrat, left the party and became an independent and a supporter of President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks, citing those attacks and Democratic policies regarding terrorism as reasons. He spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention, continued to support President Bush, and was appointed Chairman for the Millennium Committee by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

In a blog post on the PJ Media website, Silver recounted that colleagues on the set of &quot;The West Wing&quot; had teasingly referred to him as &quot;Ron, Ron, the Neo-Con&quot;.

On October 7, 2005, President Bush nominated Silver to the Board of Directors of the United States Institute of Peace. On September 8, 2006, it was announced that Silver had joined an advisory committee to the Lewis Libby Legal Defense Trust.

President Bush also appointed Silver to the Honorary Delegation that accompanied him to Jerusalem in May 2008 for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel.

In one of his last televised interviews, he told &quot;Sky News&quot; that Senator John McCain&#x27;s choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate in the 2008 Presidential election was a &quot;brilliant political choice&quot; but that a part of him wished to &quot;see an African American become president in my lifetime&quot;. In his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, his brother, Mitchell Silver, was quoted as saying, &quot;He told me that he did vote for Barack Obama in the end&quot;.

==Death==
Silver, a long-time smoker, died on March 15, 2009, at the age of 62, of esophageal cancer, which had been diagnosed two years earlier. He is buried at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

<text>Bratunac () is a town and municipality located in the easternmost part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2013 census, the municipality has a population of 20,340 inhabitants, while the town of Bratunac has a population of 8,359 inhabitants.

==History==

===Early history===
In 1381, the name Bratunac was mentioned for the first time because of the direct road from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Serbia that passed through Bratunac. At the time, Bratunac was composed of five houses and had a population of roughly 30 people. In 1461, the region was conquered by the Ottomans under Mehmed II. Under Ottoman rule, it was transformed into a kasbah that included mosques, a madrasa, several mekteps, shadirvans, caravanserais, and other types of Islamic architecture. In 1878, as the Ottoman Empire fell into decline, Austro-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina and ruled over Bratunac until its dissolution at the end of the WW1. In 1927, Bratunac became a municipality for the first time.

<text>Edwin Carl Johnson (January 1, 1884 – May 30, 1970) was an American politician of the Democratic Party who served as both governor of and U.S. senator from the state of Colorado.

==Background==
Johnson was born in Scandia in Republic County in northern Kansas. As a child, he moved with his family to Elsie, Perkins County, Nebraska and then to Lincoln, Nebraska. Johnson attended Lincoln High School under the tutelage of William Jennings Bryan, who was serving as a substitute teacher. After graduation in 1903, Johnson pursued his dream of becoming a railroad man, and after numerous positions became a train dispatcher/telegrapher at Fairmont in Fillmore County in southeastern Nebraska. In 1909, Johnson contracted tuberculosis and was advised to relocate to Colorado, where the climate was believed helpful in his medical situation. After recovering from the disease he settled together with his wife near Craig, Colorado.

==Career==
Beginning in 1923, Johnson served in the Colorado House of Representatives for four terms. He was lieutenant governor from 1931 to 1933. He represented Colorado for three terms in the United States Senate from 1937 until 1955, during which time from 1937 to 1940 he was an intraparty critic of the New Deal policies of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Johnson served as the 26th and 34th governor of Colorado from January 10, 1933 until January 1, 1937 and from January 11, 1955 until January 8, 1957. He opposed FDR’s New Deal policies.

===Ingrid Bergman incident===
He was perhaps best known for presenting a speech on March 14, 1950, on the Senate floor, criticizing the extramarital affair of actress Ingrid Bergman, who at the time was married to Petter Lindström. Bergman&#x27;s affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini became a cause célèbre as a result of Johnson&#x27;s speech, forcing her to relocate to Europe for several years. Johnson then proposed a bill where movies would be licensed based on the perceived morality of the actors/actresses and stated that Bergman “had perpetrated an assault upon the institution of marriage,” and called her “a powerful influence for evil.”

Prior to the discovery of her affair, Ingrid Bergman had been Johnson’s favorite actress. He felt that he had been deceived by the incident, and wished to ban her from any future Hollywood productions.

Bergman returned to Hollywood in the 1956 blockbuster film &quot;Anastasia&quot;. In 1972, Senator Charles H. Percy of Illinois entered an apology into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; for Johnson’s attack, which had been made on Bergman twenty-two years earlier.

===Atomic bombs===
Johnson is also known for the alternative he presented to mankind in November 1945: &quot;God Almighty in His infinite wisdom [has] dropped the atomic bomb in our lap.&quot; Now for the first time the United States, &quot;with vision and guts and plenty of atomic bombs,&quot; could &quot;compel mankind to adopt the policy of lasting peace … or be burned to a crisp.&quot;

==Sport affiliations==
Johnson was also the President of the Western League, a Class A baseball league, from 1947 to 1955. He was instrumental in the construction of Bears Stadium / Mile High Stadium, and was inducted in 1968 into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame.

==Death and legacy==
He died at Saint Joseph Hospital in Denver and is interred at the Fairmount Mausoleum at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver. The eastbound bore of the Eisenhower-Johnson Memorial Tunnel is named for Johnson.

<doc id="952445" wikidata="Q1032327" url="?curid=952445" title="Canadian Party">
<text>The Canadian Party was a group founded by John Christian Schultz in 1869, in the Red River Colony (which later became the Canadian province of Manitoba). It was not a political party in the modern sense but was rather a forum for local ultra-Protestant agitators.

The Canadian Party promoted the annexation of the Red River Colony by the Canadian government. It also encouraged settlement by Anglophone Protestants from the province of Ontario.

Schultz&#x27;s goal was to reconstruct the Red River Colony in the image of Protestant Ontario. To this end, his followers were engaged in extensive land speculation in the region. They were regarded with suspicion by most of the established settlers, and particularly by the local Métis population led by Louis Riel.

Members of the Canadian Party engaged in military skirmishes with Riel&#x27;s provisional government during the Red River Rebellion of 1869-70. After fleeing to Ontario, Schultz, assisted by supporters of the Canada First movement, was instrumental in exploiting the execution of Thomas Scott to inflame Protestant opinion in Ontario against Riel.

Following the Manitoba Act of 1870, the Canadian government &quot;pacified&quot; the Red River Colony through the use of Canadian militia soldiers in mid-1870. The Canadian Party, however, was not accepted into the new governing structure of the age. The federal government of John A. Macdonald favoured a policy of conciliation among the province&#x27;s ethnic, linguistic and religious groups, and Lieutenant-Governor Adams George Archibald kept Schultz&#x27;s followers out of his first cabinet.

In Manitoba&#x27;s first general election (December 30, 1870), Schultz&#x27;s followers were the only real opposition to the governing alliance. They won only five seats, one of which was overturned on appeal. Schultz was personally defeated in Winnipeg and St. John.

The Canadian Party continued to exist as a loose alliance after the election. At one stage, Lt. Governor Archibald warned Macdonald that its members were plotting the &quot;extermination&quot; of the Métis.

The party did not long survive as a coherent organization, but Edward Hay appears to have turned against Schultz in 1872, and later joined the government of francophone Premier Marc-Amable Girard. Some members of the Canadian Party would later resurface as Liberals, others as Conservatives.

<doc id="952447" wikidata="Q2045896" url="?curid=952447" title="David Levy Yulee">
<text>David Levy Yulee (born David Levy; June 12, 1810 – October 10, 1886) was an American politician and attorney who served as the senator from Florida immediately before the American Civil War. A secessionist and slaveowner, he also founded the Florida Railroad Company and served as president of several other rail companies, earning him the nickname of &quot;Father of Florida Railroads.&quot;

Yulee was born on the island of St. Thomas, then under British control, to a Sephardic Jewish family; his father was a trader from Morocco and his mother, also of Sephardi descent, was born in Sint Eustatius and raised in St. Thomas. The family moved to Florida when he was a child. He later served as Florida&#x27;s territorial delegate to Congress.

Yulee was the first person of Jewish ancestry elected to the United States House of Representatives as well as the first elected to the United States Senate. He added Yulee, the name of a Moroccan ancestor, to his name soon after his 1846 marriage to Nancy Christian Wickliffe, daughter of ex-Governor Charles A. Wickliffe of Kentucky. Though Yulee converted to Christianity, became an Episcopalian, and raised his children as Christian, he encountered antisemitism throughout his career.

Yulee was in favor of slavery and the secession of Florida. His fortune came from a sugarcane plantation on the Homosassa River, and his antebellum railroads were largely built by slave labor. After the Civil War, he was imprisoned at Fort Pulaski for nine months for aiding the escape of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. After being pardoned by President Andrew Johnson, he returned to his Florida railroad interests and other business ventures. In 2000 he was recognized as a &quot;Great Floridian&quot; by the state.

==Early life and education==
He was born David Levy in Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas. His father was Moses Elias Levy, a Sephardi Jewish businessman from Morocco who made a fortune in lumber in the British colony. His mother, Hannah Abendanone, was also Sephardi; her ancestors were expelled from Spain to the Netherlands and England. His grandfather Eliyahu ha-Levy ibn-Yuli served as an undersecretary to Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah while his paternal grandmother Rachel was from Tangiers and was said to have spoken fluent Spanish. Some later migrated to the Caribbean as English colonists during the British occupation of the Danish West Indies (now the United States Virgin Islands). Moses Levy was a first cousin and business partner of Phillip Benjamin, the father of Judah P. Benjamin, the future Secretary of State of the Confederate States of America.

After the family immigrated to the United States in the early 1820s, Moses Levy bought of land near present-day Jacksonville, Florida Territory. He wanted to establish a &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; for Jewish settlers. The parents sent their son to a boy&#x27;s academy and college in Norfolk, Virginia. Levy studied law with Robert R. Reid in St. Augustine, was admitted to the bar in 1832, and started a law practice in St. Augustine.
==Early political career==
During his twenties, Levy served in the territorial militia, including during the Second Seminole War. In 1834, he was present at a conference with Seminole chiefs, including Osceola.

In 1836, Levy was elected to the Florida Territory&#x27;s Legislative Council, serving from 1837 to 1839. He was a delegate to the territory&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1838 and served as the legislature&#x27;s clerk in 1841.

==Florida businessman==

In 1851 Yulee founded a sugar cane plantation, built and maintained by enslaved African Americans, along the Homosassa River. The remains of his plantation, which was destroyed during the Civil War, are now the Yulee Sugar Mill Ruins State Historic Site. Yulee was also business partners with John William Pearson at Orange Springs, Florida, but he abandoned his idea of building a railroad in the area as tensions rose and war seemed imminent.

While living in Fernandina, Yulee began to develop a railroad across Florida. He had planned since 1837 to build a state-owned system. He became the first Southerner to use state grants under the Florida Internal Improvement Act of 1855, passed to encourage the development of such infrastructure. He made extensive use of the act to secure federal and state land grants &quot;as a basis of credit&quot; to acquire land and build railroad networks, which were built with slave and Irish immigrant labor through the Florida wilderness.

Issuing public stock, Yulee chartered the Florida Railroad in 1853. He planned its eastern and western terminals at deep-water ports, Fernandina (Port of Fernandina) on Amelia Island on the Atlantic side, and Cedar Key on the Gulf of Mexico, to provide for connection to ocean-going shipping. His company began construction in 1855. On March 1, 1861, the first train arrived from the east in Cedar Key, just weeks before the beginning of the Civil War.

==Political career==
Levy (still going by that surname) was elected in 1841 as the delegate from the Florida Territory to the United States House of Representatives and served four years. He was seated after his election, but his position was disputed, as opponents argued that he was not a citizen. Levy agreed to suspend his legislative activities pending resolution of this issue in the next Congressional session. By late March 1842 the associated investigations, committee votes, and attempts to bring the issue to a vote in the full House, which included a defense by Levy and testimony from witnesses favorable to him, had not produced a definitive opinion of the House. Levy was allowed to take his seat, and no further attempts were made to contest his claim to it. Once seated in the House, Levy worked to gain statehood for the territory and to protect the expansion of slavery in other newly admitted states.

In 1845, after Florida was admitted as a state, the legislature elected Levy as a Democrat to the United States Senate, the first Jew in the United States to win a seat in the Senate. He served until 1851 (during which period he began using Yulee as his surname). During his first Senate term, he served as chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Private Land Claims (1845–1849) and the United States Senate Committee on Naval Affairs (1849–1851).

In 1855 Yulee was again elected by the Florida legislature to the Senate. He served until resigning in 1861 to support the Confederacy at the start of the American Civil War.

Yulee&#x27;s inflammatory pro-slavery rhetoric in the Senate earned him the nickname &quot;Florida Fire-Eater&quot;. Although he frequently denied that he favored secession, Yulee and his colleague, Senator Stephen Mallory, jointly requested from the War Department a statement of munitions and equipment in Florida forts on January 2, 1860. He wrote to a friend in the state, &quot;the immediately important thing to be done is the occupation of the forts and arsenals in Florida.&quot;

==Civil War==
There is some dispute as to Yulee&#x27;s wartime legislative service. Some sources state that he served in the Confederate Congress and others do not. A United States Senate document states that Yulee did serve in the Confederate Congress. After the war, Yulee was imprisoned in Fort Pulaski for nine months for treason, specifically for aiding in the 1865 escape of Jefferson Davis.

==Reconstruction==
After receiving a pardon and being released from confinement, Yulee returned to Florida and rebuilt the Yulee Railroad, which had been destroyed by warfare. He served as president of the Florida Railroad Company from 1853 to 1866, as well as president of the Peninsular Railroad, Tropical Florida Railway, and Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad companies. His development of the railroads in Florida was his most important achievement and contribution to the state. He was called the &quot;Father of Florida Railroads&quot;. His leadership helped increase economic development in the state, including the late nineteenth-century tourist trade. In 1870 Yulee hosted President Ulysses S. Grant in Fernandina.

==Marriage and family==

In 1846, Levy officially changed his name to David Levy Yulee by an act of the Florida Legislature, adding his father&#x27;s Sephardic surname. That year he married Nancy Christian Wickliffe, the daughter of Charles A. Wickliffe, the former governor of Kentucky and Postmaster General under President John Tyler. His wife was Christian, and they raised their children in her faith. Levy was a second cousin of U.S. Senator from Louisiana Judah P. Benjamin.

===Death and legacy===
Selling the Florida Railroad, he retired in 1880 with his wife to Washington, D.C., where she had a family. Yulee died on October 10, 1886, at the Clarendon Hotel in New York City. Yulee was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
*Both the town of Yulee, Florida and Levy County, Florida are named for him.
*The town of Fernandina Beach, Florida has a statue of Yulee.
*In 2000, the Florida Department of State designated Levy Yulee as a Great Floridian in the &quot;Great Floridians 2000 Program&quot;. Award plaques in his honor were installed at both the Fernandina Chamber of Commerce and the Yulee Sugar Mill Ruins State Historic Site.
*The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<text>Book at Bedtime (A Book at Bedtime until 9 July 1993) is a long-running radio programme that is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 each weekday evening between 22:45 and 23:00.

The programme presents readings of fiction, including modern classics, new works by leading writers, and literature from around the world. Books are abridged and typically serialised over one or two weeks and occasionally three, usually read by well-known actors. Occasionally, from a collection of short stories, five stories from the book will be selected and one broadcast each evening.

==History==
The series began on the BBC Light Programme on 31 January 1949, billed for the first week only as &quot;Late-Night Serial&quot;, with the first instalment of a 15-part reading of the John Buchan novel &quot;The Three Hostages&quot;, read by Arthur Bush.

There was a break after 29 March 1957, but the programme returned under its old title, now on the BBC Home Service, on 2 April 1962; the Home Service had in fact been broadcasting weekday evening 15-minute readings since 19 September 1960, but not under the &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot; heading.

<text>Jupiter Island is a barrier island on the coast of Martin
and Palm Beach counties, Florida. It is bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the St. Lucie Inlet, on the west by the Indian River, and on the south by the Jupiter Inlet. Jupiter Island originally was two islands, Long Island on the north and Jupiter Island on the south, which were once separated by an inlet in the vicinity of North Jupiter Narrows and what is officially called Peck Lake, but commonly called Peck&#x27;s Lake.

==Palm Beach County portion==

===Jupiter Inlet Colony===
The small town of Jupiter Inlet Colony occupies
the southern tip of the island.

===Village of Tequesta===
The village of Tequesta, which is primarily located on the mainland, abuts Jupiter Inlet Colony on the north.

===Unincorporated Palm Beach County===
There are two unincorporated Palm Beach County areas on the island:
*Between Tequesta Towers and Blowing Rocks Condo
*North of Coral Cove Park, a county park that is within Tequesta city limits

==Martin County portion==

===Town of Jupiter Island===
The exceptionally wealthy town of Jupiter Island begins at the Palm Beach-Martin county line and extends north to include the southern portion of the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge. Jupiter Island was also home to Celine Dion and her husband, René Angélil, and their sons, Rene-Charles, Nelson and Eddy, up until 2013. The zip code for the town is 33455, which is the zip code for much of Hobe Sound.

===Unincorporated Martin County===
Unincorporated Martin County runs north from the northern Jupiter Island town limits to the St. Lucie Inlet and includes the following:
* The northern part of the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge, and
* St. Lucie Inlet Preserve State Park, which runs north from the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge to the St. Lucie Inlet and is accessible only by boat.
* Blowing Rocks Preserve an environmental preserve on Jupiter Island in Hobe Sound, Martin County.

==Transportation==
The principal north-south road on Jupiter Island is Beach Road. Beach Road is also County Road 707, and extends from the Tequesta Bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway north to Bridge Road in the Town of Jupiter Island, where CR 708 turns left onto Bridge Road to go to Hobe Sound, via the Hobe Sound Bridge.

<doc id="952459" wikidata="Q48385308" url="?curid=952459" title="Bed bug">
<text>Bed bugs are parasitic insects from the genus &quot;Cimex&quot;, which are micropredators that feed on blood, usually at night. Their bites can result in a number of health impacts, including skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms. Bed bug bites may lead to skin changes ranging from small areas of redness to prominent blisters. Symptoms may take between minutes to days to appear and itchiness is generally present. Some individuals may feel tired or have a fever. Typically, uncovered areas of the body are affected. Their bites are not known to transmit any infectious disease. Complications may rarely include areas of dead skin or vasculitis.
Bed bug bites are caused primarily by two species of insects: &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot; (the common bed bug) and &quot;Cimex hemipterus&quot;, found primarily in the tropics. Their size ranges between 1 and 7 mm. They spread by crawling between nearby locations or by being carried within personal items. Infestation is rarely due to a lack of hygiene but is more common in high-density areas. Diagnosis involves both finding the bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms. Bed bugs spend much of their time in dark, hidden locations like mattress seams, or cracks in a wall.
Treatment is directed towards the symptoms. Eliminating bed bugs from the home is often difficult, partly because bed bugs can survive up to approximately 300 days without feeding. Repeated treatments of a home may be required. These treatments may include heating the room to for more than 90 minutes, frequent vacuuming, washing clothing at high temperatures, and the use of various pesticides.
Fossils found in Egypt show bed bugs have been known as human parasites for at least 3,500 years. Despite being nearly eradicated in developed countries after World War II, infestations have increased since the 1990s and bed bugs are now relatively common in all regions of the globe. Experts point to several factors that have contributed to the explosion in infestations over the last three decades: increased immigration and international travel; expanded markets for second-hand goods; a greater focus on control of other pests; the banning of certain pesticides and increased resistance to pesticides still in use.
==Effects on humans==

Bed bugs infest dwellings and bite people, causing irritation and sometimes other issues. There is no evidence that bed bugs transmit infectious diseases even though they appear physically capable of carrying pathogens and this possibility has been investigated.

===Bites===
The most common skin findings associated with bed bug bites are itching, flat and bumpy, reddish lesions. Each lesion is about but may be as large as in diameter and there may or may not be a central spot (punctum). Bites are usually present on areas of exposed skin, especially exposed areas not covered by sheets or blankets, such as arms, legs, feet, face or neck. Individual responses to bites vary, ranging from no visible effect (in about 20–70%), to small flat (macular) spots, to the formation of prominent blisters (wheals and bullae) along with intense itching that may last several days. Vesicles and nodules may also form. The lesions due to bites may become secondarily infected due to scratching but systemic effects from bed bug bites are very rare. A central spot of bleeding may also occur due to the release of blood thinning substances in the bug&#x27;s saliva.

Symptoms may not appear until some days after the bites have occurred. Reactions often become brisker after multiple bites due to possible sensitization to the salivary proteins of the bed bug. Numerous bites may lead to a red rash or hives.

Bedbug bites may cause other symptoms and health issues. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis from the injection of serum and other non-specific proteins have been documented, though rarely. As each bite takes a tiny amount of blood, chronic or severe infestation may lead to anemia. Scratching bites may lead to bacterial skin infection. Systemic poisoning may occur if the bites are numerous. The bite itself may be painful thus resulting in poor sleep and worse work performance.

Bed bugs can feed on warm-blooded animals other than humans, such as pets. The signs left by the bites are the same as in the case of people and cause identical symptoms (skin irritation, scratching etc.). Bed bugs can infest poultry sheds and cause anemia and a decrease in egg production in hens.

====Treatment====
Treatment of bed bug bites requires keeping the person from being repeatedly bitten, and possible symptomatic use of antihistamines and corticosteroids (either topically or systemically). There however is no evidence that medications improve outcomes, and symptoms usually resolve without treatment in 1–2 weeks.

===Other effects of infestation===
It is possible that exposure to bed bugs may trigger an asthma attack via the effects of airborne allergens, although evidence of this association is limited.

Serious infestations and chronic attacks can cause anxiety, stress, and sleep difficulties. Development of refractory delusional parasitosis is possible, as a person develops an overwhelming obsession with bed bugs.

==Description==
Bed bug infestations are primarily the result of two species of insects from genus &quot;Cimex&quot;: &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot; (the common bed bug) and &quot;Cimex hemipterus&quot; (the tropical bed bug). These insects feed exclusively on blood and, at any stage of development, may survive up to 70 days without feeding. Adult &quot;Cimex&quot; are light brown to reddish-brown, flat, oval, and have no hind wings. The front wings are vestigial and reduced to pad-like structures. Adults grow to long and wide. Female common bed bugs can lay 1–10 eggs per day and 200–500 eggs in their lifetime, whereas female tropical bed bugs can lay about 50 eggs in their lifetime.

Bed bugs have five immature nymph life stages and a final sexually mature adult stage. Bed bugs need at least one blood meal in order to advance to the next stage of development. They shed their skins through ecdysis at each stage, discarding their outer exoskeleton. Newly hatched nymphs are translucent, lighter in color, and become browner as they moult and reach maturity. Bed bugs may be mistaken for other insects, such as booklice, small cockroaches, or carpet beetles; however, when warm and active, their movements are more ant-like, and like most other true bugs, they emit a characteristic disagreeable odor when crushed.

Bed bugs are obligatory bloodsuckers. They have mouth parts that saw through the skin and inject saliva with anticoagulants and painkillers. Sensitivity of humans varies from extreme allergic reaction to no reaction at all (about 20%). The bite usually produces a swelling with no red spot, but when many bugs feed on a small area, reddish spots may appear after the swelling subsides. Bedbugs prefer exposed skin, preferably the face, neck, and arms of a sleeping person.

Bed bugs are attracted to their hosts primarily by carbon dioxide, secondarily by warmth, and also by certain chemicals. There is strong evidence that bed bugs can respond and orient towards human odors, independently of all other host cues. &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot; feeds only every five to seven days, which suggests that it does not spend the majority of its life searching for a host. When a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. It returns to its shelter after successful feeding or if it encounters exposure to light. &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot; aggregate under all life stages and mating conditions. Bed bugs may choose to aggregate because of predation, resistance to desiccation, and more opportunities to find a mate. Airborne pheromones are responsible for aggregations.

==Infestation==
Infestation is rarely caused by a lack of hygiene. Transfer to new places is usually in the personal items of the human they feed upon. Dwellings can become infested with bed bugs in a variety of ways, such as:
* Bugs and eggs inadvertently brought in from other infested dwellings on a visiting person&#x27;s clothing or luggage;
* Infested items (such as furniture especially beds or couches, clothing, or backpacks) brought into a home or business;
* Proximity of infested dwellings or items, if easy routes are available for travel, e.g. through ducts or false ceilings;
* Wild animals (such as bats or birds) that may also harbour bed bugs or related species such as the bat bug;
* People visiting an infested area (e.g. dwelling, means of transport, entertainment venue, or lodging) and carrying the bugs to another area on their clothing, luggage, or bodies. Bedbugs are increasingly found in air travel.

Though bed bugs will opportunistically feed on pets, they do not live or travel on the skin of their hosts, and pets are not believed to be a factor in their spread.

===Detection===
Knowing that symptoms are caused by bedbug bites rather than other causes requires seeking and finding the insect in the sleeping environment, as symptoms are not specific to bedbug bites. Bites by other arthropods cause similar symptoms, even the linear pattern of bites known colloquially as &quot;breakfast, lunch and dinner bites&quot;.

Bed bugs can occur singly, but tend to congregate once established. Although strictly parasitic, they spend only a tiny fraction of their lives physically attached to hosts. Once a bed bug finishes feeding, it follows a chemical trail to return to a nearby harborage, commonly in or near beds or couches, where they live in clusters of adults, juveniles, and eggs. These places may include luggage, vehicle interiors, furniture, bedside clutter—even inside electrical sockets or laptop computers. Bed bugs may also lodge near animals that have nested within a dwelling, such as bats, birds, or rodents. They can also survive by feeding on domestic cats and dogs, though humans are the preferred host of &quot;C. lectularius&quot;.

A severe bedbug infestation can be detected by their characteristic pungent sweet smell, which has been described as like rotting raspberries. Bed bug detection dogs are trained to pinpoint infestations, with a possible accuracy rate between 11% and 83%.

Homemade detectors have been developed. Bedbug detectors, often referred to as &quot;monitors&quot;, &quot;traps&quot; or &quot;interceptors&quot;, use the lactic acid or carbon dioxide associated with the presence of a human body, or pheromones, to attract and trap bugs in a container. Bedbug detectors can confirm an infestation, but do not trap enough for eradication.
====Differential detection====
Other conditions which produce symptoms similar to bedbug bites include scabies, gamasoidosis, allergic reactions, mosquito bites, spider bites, flea bites (pulicosis), chicken pox, and bacterial skin infections.

===Prevention===
To prevent bringing home bed bugs from outside the home, people are advised to take precautions after visiting an infested site or traveling on means of transport that may be infested; precautions include checking shoes on leaving the site, changing clothes outside the house before entering, and putting the used clothes in a clothes dryer outside the house. When visiting a new lodging, it is advised to check the bed before taking suitcases into the sleeping area, and putting the suitcase on a raised stand to make bedbugs less likely to crawl in. Clothes should be hung up or left in the suitcase rather than left on the floor. Additional preventative measures include sealing cracks and crevices (where bed bugs often hide), inspecting furniture, and decontaminating clothes and luggage upon returning home. The founder of a company dedicated to bedbug extermination said that 5% of hotel rooms he booked into were infested. He advised people never to sit down on public transport; check office chairs, plane seats, and hotel mattresses; and monitor and vacuum home beds once a month. Close all wall openings or gaps; bed bugs tend to hide in dark places such as cracks in walls. Second-hand furnishings may harbour bedbugs.

===Management===

Avoiding repeated bites can be difficult since it usually requires eradicating bed bugs from a home or workplace; eradication is most effective using non-chemical control methods. Non-chemical control methods include vacuuming carpet and furniture (often with scraping) into a disposable bag which is then sealed into a plastic bag to prevent re-infestation. Other methods include removing textile materials from an area and washing them in hot water (at least 60 degrees Celsius) or freezing them at . Most consumer-grade freezers are inadequate to kill bedbugs because they cannot create sufficiently low temperatures. Unremovable textiles such as mattresses can be steamed to at least and this method can penetrate deep into the textile to effectively kill bed bugs in, potentially, under one minute. Heating tents or chambers can be used for infested materials or entire rooms can be heated to at least to effectively eradicate infestation.

There is no evidence to indicate that a combination of non-chemical methods plus insecticides is more effective than non-chemical methods alone with regards to eradication of bed bug infestations.

Insecticides are mostly ineffective for the eradication of bedbug infestations as most bedbugs are resistant to insecticides, including pyrethroids which are found in approximately 90% of commercial grade insecticides. Furthermore, insect foggers (known as &quot;bug bombs&quot;) are ineffective in the eradication of bed bug infestation as they are unable to penetrate bed bug harborages. Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly over time, and there are concerns about harm to health from their use.

Once established, bed bugs are extremely difficult to get rid of, particularly in buildings with multiple dwellings, as they may be present in other parts of the building than the dwelling being treated, and can re-establish populations by moving from infested to decontaminated areas.
Mechanical approaches, such as vacuuming up the insects and heat-treating or wrapping mattresses, are effective. An hour at a temperature of or over, or two hours at less than kills them. This may include a domestic clothes drier for fabric or a commercial steamer. Bed bugs and their eggs will die on contact when exposed to surface temperatures above and a steamer can reach well above . A study found 100% mortality rates for bed bugs exposed to temperatures greater than for more than 2 minutes. The study recommended maintaining temperatures of above for more than 20 min to effectively kill all life stages of bed bugs, and because in practice treatment times of 6 to 8 hours are used to account for cracks and indoor clutter. This method is expensive and has caused fires. Starving bedbugs is not effective, as they can survive without eating for 135 to 300 days, depending on temperature.
After the withdrawal of most organochlorine insecticides, that no truly effective insecticides were available. Insecticides that have historically been found effective include pyrethroids, dichlorvos, and malathion. Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly in recent decades. The carbamate insecticide propoxur is highly toxic to bed bugs, but it has potential toxicity to children exposed to it, and the US Environmental Protection Agency has been reluctant to approve it for indoor use. Boric acid, sometimes applied as a safe indoor insecticide against pests such as cockroaches and termites, is not effective against bed bugs because they do not groom.

==Distribution==
Bed bugs are found everywhere in the world. Before the 1950s about 30% of houses in the United States had bedbugs; this percentage has fallen, which is believed to be partly due to the use of DDT to kill cockroaches. The invention of the vacuum cleaner and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role in the decrease. Others believe it might simply be the cyclical nature of the organism.

However, rates of infestation in developed countries have increased dramatically since the 1980s. This is thought to be due to greater foreign travel; increased immigration from the developing world to the developed world; more frequent exchange of second-hand furnishings among homes; a greater focus on control of other pests, resulting in neglect of bed bug countermeasures; and the banning of effective pesticides coupled with increased resistance to those pesticides still permitted. The decrease in cockroach populations due to insecticide use may have aided bed bugs&#x27; resurgence, since cockroaches eat bedbugs. Increasing resistance to DDT and other potent pesticides may have also contributed, along with bans on DDT.

The U.S. National Pest Management Association reported a 71% increase in bed bug calls between 2000 and 2005. The number of reported incidents in New York City alone rose from 500 in 2004 to 10,000 in 2009. In 2013 Chicago was listed as the US city with most bedbug infestation. In response the Chicago City Council passed a bed bug control ordinance to limit spread. Additionally, bed bugs are reaching places in which they never established before, such as southern South America.

The rise in infestations has been hard to track because bed bug infestation is not an easily identifiable problem, and also people do not talk about it. Most reports have been collected from pest-control companies, local authorities, and hotel chains, and the problem may be more severe than is currently believed from reports.

==Species==
The common bed bug (&quot;Cimex lectularius&quot;) is the species best adapted to human environments but is also known from birds, Chiroptera, &quot;Gallus&quot; (chickens and relatives), &quot;Myotis myotis&quot;, and sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;). It is found in temperate climates throughout the world. Other species include &quot;C. hemipterus&quot;, found in tropical regions, which also infests poultry (including &quot;Gallus&quot;) and bats, and &quot;Leptocimex boueti&quot;, a relative of &quot;C. lectularius&quot; adapted for the tropics of West Africa and South America, which infests bats and humans. &quot;C. pilosellus&quot; and &quot;C. pipistrella&quot; primarily infest bats, while &quot;Haematosiphon inodora&quot;, a species of North America, primarily infests poultry.

== Evolution ==
Cimicidae, the ancestor of modern bed bugs, first emerged approximately 115 million years ago, more than 55 million years before bats—their previously presumed initial host—first appeared. From unknown ancestral hosts, a variety of different lineages evolved which specialized in either bats or birds. The common (&quot;C. lectularius&quot;) and tropical bed bug (&quot;C. hemipterus&quot;) split 40 million years before &quot;Homo&quot; evolution. Humans became hosts to bed bugs through host specialist extension (rather than switching) on three separate occasions.

==Historical reports==

Bed bugs were first mentioned in ancient Greece as early as 400 BC, and later by Aristotle. Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, first published &quot;circa&quot; AD 77 in Rome, claimed bed bugs had medicinal value in treating ailments such as snake bites and ear infections. Belief in the medicinal use of bed bugs persisted until at least the 18th century, when Guettard recommended their use in the treatment of hysteria.

Bed bugs were also mentioned in Germany in the 11th century, in France in the 13th century, and in England in 1583, though they remained rare in England until 1670. Some in the 18th century believed bed bugs had been brought to London with supplies of wood to rebuild the city after the Great Fire of London (1666). Giovanni Antonio Scopoli noted their presence in Carniola (roughly equivalent to present-day Slovenia) in the 18th century.

Traditional methods of repelling or killing bed bugs include the use of plants, fungi, and insects (or their extracts), such as black pepper; black cohosh (&quot;Actaea racemosa&quot;); &quot;Pseudarthria hookeri&quot;; &quot;Laggera alata&quot; (Chinese &quot;yángmáo cǎo&quot; | 羊毛草); &quot;Eucalyptus saligna&quot; oil; henna (&quot;Lawsonia inermis&quot; or camphire); &quot;infused oil of &quot;Melolontha vulgaris&quot;&quot; (presumably cockchafer); fly agaric (&quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;); tobacco; &quot;heated oil of Terebinthina&quot; (i.e. true turpentine); wild mint (&quot;Mentha arvensis&quot;); narrow-leaved pepperwort (&quot;Lepidium ruderale&quot;); &quot;Myrica&quot; spp. (e.g. bayberry); Robert geranium (&quot;Geranium robertianum&quot;); bugbane (&quot;Cimicifuga&quot; spp.); &quot;herb and seeds of &quot;Cannabis&quot;&quot;; &quot;opulus&quot; berries (possibly maple or European cranberrybush); masked hunter bugs (&quot;Reduvius personatus&quot;), &quot;and many others&quot;.

In the mid-19th century, smoke from peat fires was recommended as an indoor domestic fumigant against bed bugs.

Dusts have been used to ward off insects from grain storage for centuries, including plant ash, lime, dolomite, certain types of soil, and diatomaceous earth or Kieselguhr. Of these, diatomaceous earth in particular has seen a revival as a non-toxic (when in amorphous form) residual pesticide for bed bug abatement. While diatomaceous earth often performs poorly, silica gel may be effective.

Basket-work panels were put around beds and shaken out in the morning in the UK and in France in the 19th century. Scattering leaves of plants with microscopic hooked hairs around a bed at night, then sweeping them up in the morning and burning them, was a technique reportedly used in Southern Rhodesia and in the Balkans.

Bean leaves have been used historically to trap bedbugs in houses in Eastern Europe. The trichomes on the bean leaves capture the insects by impaling the feet (tarsi) of the insects. The leaves are then destroyed.

=== 20th century ===
Until the mid-20th century, bed bugs were very common. According to a report by the UK Ministry of Health, in 1933, all the houses in many areas had some degree of bed bug infestation. The increase in bed bug populations in the early 20th century has been attributed to the advent of electric heating, which allowed bed bugs to thrive year-round instead of only in warm weather.

Bed bugs were a serious problem at US military bases during World War II. Initially, the problem was solved by fumigation, using Zyklon Discoids that released hydrogen cyanide gas, a rather dangerous procedure. Later, DDT was used to good effect, though bedbugs have since become largely resistant to it.

The decline of bed bug populations in the 20th century is often credited to potent pesticides that had not previously been widely available. Other contributing factors that are less frequently mentioned in news reports are increased public awareness and slum clearance programs that combined pesticide use with steam disinfection, relocation of slum dwellers to new housing, and in some cases also follow-up inspections for several months after relocated tenants moved into their new housing.

=== 21st century ===
In 2010, bed bug infestations were reported in New York houses, retail stores, cinemas, offices and schools, especially in Brooklyn and Queens. In early 2023, Orkin reported that Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Los Angeles were the top five cities in the United States with most bed bug infestations.

In France, these insects re-emerged, despite having disappeared from daily life in the 1950s, due to nomadic lifestyles, consumption of second-hand purchases, and bugs&#x27; resistance to insecticides, in addition to increased traveling and tourism following the COVID-19 lockdowns. Between 2017 and 2022, 11% of French households were infested by bed bugs, according to a report from the National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES). In the middle of 2023, reports emerged of a bed bug infestation spread in the capital city of Paris, when it was first seen in cinemas, then it expanded to homes, trains, schools and even hospitals. Treatment of this outbreak has cost France an estimated €230m annually. In the meantime, the United Kingdom witnessed a 65% increase in year-on-year infestations across the country, according to Rentokil. In November 2023, it was reported that South Korea was experiencing a bed bug infestation.

==Society and culture==
=== Legal action ===
Bed bugs are an increasing cause for litigation. Courts have, in some cases, exacted large punitive damage judgments on some hotels. Many of New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side homeowners have been afflicted, but they tend to remain publicly silent in order not to ruin their property values and be seen as suffering a blight typically associated with &quot;lower social class.&quot; Local Law 69 in New York City requires owners of buildings with three or more units to provide their tenants and potential tenants with reports of bedbug history in each unit. They must also prominently post these listings and reports in their building.

===Idiom===
* &quot;Good night, sleep tight, don&#x27;t let the bed bugs bite,&quot; is a traditional saying.
