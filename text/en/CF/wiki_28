<text>Marco Johann Sturm (born September 8, 1978) is a German professional ice hockey coach and former winger who played in the National Hockey League and Deutsche Eishockey Liga from 1995 to 2013. He is currently the Head Coach of the Ontario Reign.

Sturm began his career with the German club EV Landshut, playing with the team from 1995 to 1997. Selected 21st overall in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks, he played his rookie season with the team in 1997–98. After eight-and-a-half seasons with the Sharks, he was traded to the Boston Bruins as part of a package deal for Joe Thornton in November 2005. Sturm remained with Boston until 2010–11, when he split the campaign with the Los Angeles Kings and Washington Capitals. He signed with the Vancouver Canucks as an unrestricted free agent in July 2011, but was quickly traded to the Florida Panthers less than a month into the subsequent season.

A one-time NHL All-Star (1999), Sturm established himself as a consistent 20-goal scorer in the league, achieving the mark seven of eight times between 2001–02 and 2009–10. He was the most productive German player in the league until Leon Draisaitl surpassed him in 2021. Internationally, Sturm competed for Germany in four IIHF World Championships, two Winter Olympics and one World Cup.

==Playing career==

===EV Landshut (1995–1997)===
After playing in EV Landshut&#x27;s junior program in Germany, he joined the club&#x27;s premier Deutsche Eishockey Liga team for the 1995–96 season. At 17 years old, he recorded 12 goals and 32 points over 47 games as a rookie. On a team basis, EV Landshut came within three points of the regular season title. During the off-season, he was selected by the San Jose Sharks in the first round, 21st overall, of the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. Returning to Germany for one more season with EV Landshut, he improved to 16 goals and 43 points over 46 games, ranking fourth in team scoring.

===San Jose Sharks (1997–2005)===
In July 1997, Sturm signed his first NHL contract with the Sharks. Making the team out of training camp, he was scratched for the first game of the 1997–98 season. The following game, he dressed and scored his first career NHL goal against Jeff Hackett of the Chicago Blackhawks on October 4, 1997. His goal, a game-winner, came on a breakaway after exiting the penalty box and broke a 2–2 tie. Following his second month of NHL play, Sturm was already establishing himself in the NHL as a defensively responsible, two-way forward, and was second among league rookies in scoring to Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mike Johnson. Consequently, he was named the league&#x27;s rookie of the month for November 1997. He finished the season with 30 (10 goals and 20 assists) points over 74 games, ranking fifth in scoring among league rookies. Finishing with the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference, the Sharks qualified for the playoffs for the first time in three years. Facing the Dallas Stars in the first round, they were eliminated in six games. Sturm appeared in two post-season games, recording no points.

The following season, Sturm was named to the 1999 NHL All-Star Game. Competing with Team World, he finished with the second best time in the Skills Competition&#x27;s fastest skater segment, circling the rink in 14.654 seconds, 14 hundredths of a second slower than the Washington Capitals&#x27; Peter Bondra. Sturm later scored a goal in a losing cause as North America beat Team World by an 8–6 score. Playing in his second NHL season, Sturm improved to 16 goals and 38 points over 78 games. Late in the campaign, he suffered a hyper-extended knee during a game against the Edmonton Oilers on April 12, 1999. He missed the final two games of the regular season, but returned in time for the 1999 playoffs. He added 2 goals and 4 points over 6 games as the Sharks were eliminated in the first round by the Colorado Avalanche.

In the next two seasons, Sturm recorded points totals of 27 and 32. He helped the Sharks advance to the second round of the 2000 playoffs, defeating the St. Louis Blues in seven games before being eliminated by the Stars. In 2001–02, Sturm reached the 40-plus mark in points with 21 goals and 20 assists. His efforts helped the Sharks win the Pacific Division for the first time in team history. They went on to lose in the second round of the 2002 playoffs to the Colorado Avalanche. During the off-season, he was re-signed by the Sharks to a one-year contract on July 1, 2002. The following campaign, he recorded 28 goals and 48 points, his highest totals as a Shark, earning him a two-year contract with the team, signed on July 16, 2003. However, the Sharks missed the playoffs for the first time in Sturm&#x27;s tenure in San Jose, finishing second-last in the West.

Sturm was on pace for another career year in 2003–04 when he suffered a season-ending knee injury on March 5, 2004. Missing the last 15 games of the regular season, he recorded 21 goals and 41 points over 64 games. In Sturm&#x27;s absence, the Sharks qualified for the Western Conference Finals during the 2004 playoffs for the first time in team history, but lost to the Calgary Flames in six games. Due to the NHL lockout, Sturm played the 2004–05 season back in Germany with ERC Ingolstadt of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. He recorded 38 points (22 goals and 16 assists) over 64 regular season games, then helped his team to the playoff semifinals.

Returning to the Sharks as NHL play resumed for the 2005–06 season, Sturm was then traded to the Boston Bruins on November 30, 2005, along with defenceman Brad Stuart and forward Wayne Primeau for All-Star centre Joe Thornton. With 273 points in 553 games over nearly eight-and-a-half seasons in San Jose, he left the Sharks ranked sixth in all-time team scoring.

===Boston Bruins (2005–2010)===
At the time of the trade, Sturm had recorded 16 points in 23 games with the Sharks. Playing with his new team, he finished the 2005–06 season with career-highs of 29 goals (second on the team to centre Patrice Bergeron), 30 assists and 59 points, (third on the team behind Bergeron and winger Brad Boyes) over 74 games. The Bruins struggled as a team, however, and finished out of the playoffs. In his first full season with the Bruins, Sturm notched 27 goals and 44 points. His 17 assists were his lowest total since the 1999–2000 season. The Bruins once again failed to qualify for the playoffs. In 2007–08, Sturm neared career-highs once again as he tallied 56 points, second in team-scoring behind centre Marc Savard, as well as a team-leading 27 goals. He helped the Bruins return to the post-season as the eighth and last seed in the East, matched against the Montreal Canadiens in the first round. Facing elimination in Game 6, Sturm scored with less than three minutes remaining in regulation. After Canadiens goaltender Carey Price stopped his initial shot, Sturm retrieved his own rebound and skated the puck around Price for the game&#x27;s winning goal. Though the Bruins forced a Game 7, they lost the deciding contest and were eliminated. Sturm had 2 goals and 4 points during the series.

Sturm was beset with injuries during the 2008–09 season, the first of which was a concussion, suffered on November 19, 2008. After returning to the lineup having missed 12 games, he suffered a knee injury on December 20, 2008. The following month, he opted for surgery to repair his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), ending his season at 19 games, during which time he tallied 7 goals and 13 points. The Bruins advanced to the second round of the playoffs that year, losing in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes.
Recovered from knee surgery, Sturm returned to play in the 2009–10 season. During the 2010 Winter Classic, which the Bruins hosted against the Philadelphia Flyers at Fenway Park on January 1, 2010, Sturm scored the game-winning goal in overtime. The Bruins won by a 2–1 score. Sturm finished the season with 37 points over 76 games. His 22 goals led the Bruins in scoring for the second time in three years. He helped the Bruins qualify for the playoffs, where they were eliminated in the second round once more. During the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Flyers, Sturm injured his knee 21 seconds into Game 1, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs.

With a torn ACL and medial collateral ligament (MCL), he underwent his second knee surgery in three years and missed nearly half of the ensuing 2010–11 season due to rehabilitation.

===Post-Bruins (2010–2014)===
While his recovery from knee surgery was nearly complete, Sturm was traded to the Los Angeles Kings on December 11, 2010, in exchange for future considerations. The deal with the Kings had almost been finalized nine days prior, but had initially fallen through. On December 21, Sturm was activated from injured reserve and joined his new team wearing the #10 jersey, as his usual #16 was retired by the Kings for Hockey Hall of Fame centre Marcel Dionne. After scoring 5 goals and 9 points over 17 games with the Kings, Sturm was placed on waivers on February 25, 2011. The following day, he was claimed by the Washington Capitals. Playing 18 games with Washington, he recorded one goal and seven points. In the playoffs, he added a goal and three points over nine games as the Capitals were eliminated in the second round.

Sturm became an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, and the Vancouver Canucks expressed interest in signing him. He consulted with countryman Christian Ehrhoff, who had played defence with Vancouver for two years before signing with the Buffalo Sabres that summer. Ehrhoff recommended the team and Sturm signed to a one-year, $2.25 million deal on July 1, 2011. The Canucks had been Stanley Cup finalists the previous season and Sturm later explained he believed Vancouver was his &quot;best chance&quot; to win a championship. General manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the risk in signing Sturm, given his two knee surgeries in the past three years. Beginning the season on the second line, Sturm struggled with his new team. Less than a month into the season, on October 22, 2011, he was traded to the Florida Panthers, along with fellow veteran forward Mikael Samuelsson for forwards David Booth and Steven Reinprecht, as well as a third round pick in the 2013 draft. Sturm appeared in 49 games for Florida in 2011–12, including all 7 games of the Panthers&#x27; first-round playoff loss to the New Jersey Devils.

Following the NHL lockout Sturm began the season as an unrestricted free agent before eventually signing with Kölner Haie in the Deutsche Eishockey League. The signing was officially announced by the team on February 3, 2013. He announced his retirement from the game of ice hockey on January 27, 2014.

==Coaching career==
Sturm was named head coach and general manager of the German national team on July 10, 2015. Under his guidance, Germany won the 2015 Deutschland-Cup title. Head coaching his first World Championship in 2016, Sturm led Team Germany to a quarterfinal appearance. In September 2016, Germany won the qualifying tournament for participation in the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. At the 2017 IIHF World Championship, Sturm led the team to another quarter final, falling short to Canada (1-2). Sturm was credited with the progress of the German team, and for the willingness of the German NHL players to represent their country internationally. Under his leadership the German team reached the final at the 2018 Winter Olympics, earning the silver medal.

On November 4, 2018, he was named assistant coach of the Los Angeles Kings following the firing of assistant coach Don Nachbaur and head coach John Stevens.

==Personal life==
Sturm and his wife Astrid have two children, son Mason Joseph, and daughter Kaydie.

<text>M6 (), also known as , is the most profitable private national French television channel and the third most watched television network in the French-speaking world. M6 is the head channel of the M6 Group media empire that owns several TV channels, magazines, publications, movie production companies, and media-related firms. It is owned by RTL Group.

On 20 May 2021, it was announced that M6 Group, owners of the channel, has proposed a merger with TF1 Group, which owns competing commercial network TF1. On 16 September 2022, it was announced that the merger was officially abandoned, citing concerns from French antitrust regulator, the Autorité de la concurrence, regarding competition in the advertising sector; the combined entity was likely to have been required to sell either primary channel (M6 or TF1) for the merger to proceed.

In 2001, M6 became the first national French television network to broadcast reality programming. Its first program of this genre was &quot;Loft Story&quot;, and was highly watched. The president of TF1 at the time, Étienne Mougeotte, promised that TF1 would never air any reality programming. However, several months later, TF1 signed a contract with Endemol to air such programming. Endemol is the same company that created &quot;Loft Story&quot; for M6.

M6 is one of the only television services in France to have science-fiction programming as part of its regular schedule. Most supernatural dramas were shown on Saturday nights in what M6 called &quot;la Trilogie du Samedi&quot; (The Saturday Trilogy)

=== 6play (formerly M6 Replay; subsequently M6+) ===
On 19 March 2008, M6 launched a new website, in addition to its official site. This TV Catch-up called M6 Replay allows French Internet users (metropolitan France only) to view all M6 programs in the 6 p.m.-midnight slot (excluding films) one hour after their broadcasts, for one week. On 4 November 2013, M6 Replay was replaced by 6play.

On 27 March 2014, M6 launched 4 new thematic channels, &quot;100% online&quot;, on 6play: 6play Comic (Humor), 6play Crazy Kitchen (Cooking), 6play Sixième Style (Fashion/Beauty), and 6play Stories (TV films). On 9 February 2015, M6 launched 6play home time (Universe de la Maison).

On 1 December 2015, a new version of 6play was launched. A new 6play design is launched for the occasion and 6play now uses a personalized recommendation system under the &quot;My selection&quot; section similar to that of Netflix.

From 14 May 2024, 6play will become M6+.

<doc id="947862" wikidata="Q4659195" url="?curid=947862" title="A Report on Germany">
<text>After World War II, in 1947 Lewis H. Brown wrote at the request of General Lucius D. Clay A Report on Germany, which served as a detailed recommendation for the reconstruction of post-war Germany, and served as a basis for the Marshall Plan. General Clay selected Brown to write the report because of Brown&#x27;s broad industrial and war experience. While writing, Brown spent time in Germany, and also personally interviewed General George C. Marshall, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Joseph T. McNarney, General John H. Hilldring, John Foster Dulles, James F. Byrnes, former President Herbert Hoover, R. C. Lefingwell, Otto Jeidels, and former Senator Sinclair Weeks, among many others.

Chapter II of the book is a memorandum of the Johns-Manville economist William C. Bober to Lewis H. Brown entitled &quot;The German Situation Today.&quot; Chapter I Section 2 entitled Background of Policy is a re-arrangement of a study about the economic plans for Germany from 1946 by James P. Warburg with the original title &quot;Germany – Nation or No-Man’s-Land.&quot; 1947

== The European Vicious Cycle ==

Brown found out different vicious cycles in the European economies, which could affect the United States. In 1947 Western European countries were on the brink of bankruptcy, while Germany was already bankrupt. But Germany was a key part of Western Europe and Europe could not be reconstructed without doing likewise in Germany. European countries primarily trade with one another. The countries of Europe were so closely interrelated and economically interwoven, that whatever affected one inevitably affected the others. So the underproduction in the coalfields transmitted the scarcities of Britain to the rest of Europe. Only an economic entity, through which trade flows freely, regardless of boundaries, would be a prosperous Europe.

== The German Economic Destitution in 1947 ==

A fundamental challenge facing Germany was that it was now cut off from its Eastern breadbasket. Before the war the East of Germany produced 65 percent of its rye, potatoes and sugar beets, 70 percent of its brown coal and 75 percent of its potash vital for fertilizers. The farm production of Western Germany was 30 percent below prewar. In Western Germany lived 48 million people, 40 million of whom did not live on farms. The farms could only produce for 20 million people; 20 million must be fed from abroad, paid by export or by plain relief. In 1947 Germany was not able to pay for food imports from food-surplus producing countries. The Potsdam agreement and the Level-of-Industry-Plan made it impossible for Germany to function again as a converter nation and as the second greatest exporter in the world of producer goods, which helped half the world increase its level of production.

== The German Vicious Cycle ==

Brown sketched the process of the German economic disease as follows: The Iron Curtain separated 20 million non-farm people from the Eastern breadbasket. These 20 million got only half of what it takes to keep a worker in health and vigor. The farmers produced 30 percent less than before the war, because of lack of fertilizers, seeds, equipment and machinery. Imported food could not be paid for by exports, because exports had been reduced to a trickle. Hence the German workers in the Ruhr, which was the industrial heart of Germany and likewise of Europe, got only half the food they had gotten before the war, even with American relief. Hence they accomplished half as much work as before the war. The worker produced half as much coal, which in turn caused an acute shortage of steel for the manufacturers who were supposed to produce mining machinery, locomotives, freight cars and coal barges and repair parts to restore the devastated transport-equipment of Germany.

== Plan for Reconstruction ==

Germany is to be put back on her economic feet and production must be the first objective; long range problems should not further be placed ahead of production. As long as the partition of Germany continues, Germany must export twice as much per capita from Western Germany as she did before the war in order to pay for the food necessary to feed her workers and give them energy to produce. Reparations should therefore end in August 1947. Denazification should be brought to an end. The right to return to work should be fully granted to industrial technicians, managers and skilled workers until a denazification court decides to revocate them at a later date. German militarism is dead and the taken measures will keep it dead. German Plants manufacturing munitions of war are demolished or dismantled and transferred to the victor nations as reparations. The German airplane industry is destructed. A small but highly effective inspection and control service, maintained by the Allied Governments will bring to attention any attempt to use materials for a future war. No German army will be permitted to exist.

== The vicious coal cycle ==

In Germany almost every problem starts with coal. Coal is Europe’s number two problem, exceeded only by that of food. Since Europe has only very little oil, coal is a matter of life and death to her. Great Britain, which exported in 1937 almost 53 million tons does not supply her needs in 1947 and has to import coal. In the same year West Germany exports 4.8 million tons of coal and this small amount is too large and prevents the restoration of her economy. Poland took over all of Germany’s Silesian mines which can export ten to fifteen million tons to coal deficit countries. Transportation bottlenecks, political difficulties and exchange problems have prevented deliveries from Poland.

== Reasons for the poor output of Ruhr Coal ==
=== Lack of food ===

The miner received 4,000 calories a day. The normal ration for his family members dropped from 1,550 to 750 calories. So the miner spread his additional 2,450 supplementary calories over the members of his whole family. Thus the Ruhr worker remained too hungry and too weak for effective hard work required in underground mining. Bombing of the Ruhr damaged about 45 percent of the miners’ housing, therefore commuting from great distances was general. The simplest repair parts, even nails wood and glass are lacking or are above the miners’ income at black market prices.

=== Transport ===

The coal output accumulates at the pit heads and cannot be moved. The transport system is seriously damaged by bombing and under-maintenance. Brown coal is no longer available in West Germany, since 75 percent of German brown coal lies in the Russian Zone, which is an additional catastrophe. In November 1947 only 70,000 freight cars in the U.S. Zone will be available, instead of 93,000 in January 1947. The reason is the slow rate of repairs resulting from shortage of necessary supplies as lumber, steel, asbestos packing and lagging, cotton waste for journal boxes, oil pads and spare parts of all kind. Key supply parts and even rolling stock should be shipped from the US, before the winter 1947 may have brought a complete breakdown in the transportation system.

=== A plan to break the vicious coal cycle ===

With 35 million tons of coal more per year a dynamic German economy would get going. Brown recommended two measures: At first, the former Ruhr miners, who are prisoners of war now working in French mines, where their output is low, should be brought back more rapidly. Second, each underground Ruhr miner should be offered coupons for extra tons of coal produced, so that for 50 percent increase in production he could get 75 percent increase in food for himself and his family. Food, preferably fat and meat would be brought in from America in the 27 mine stores. Third, the coal that is now exported out from Germany should be devoted to the task to break the vicious cycle in Germany. Instead of Germany, Great Britain could supply those countries now getting coal from Germany. The British miners have been struggling for years for a five-day-week and attained their long sought objective in May 1947 and work now a five day week for six days&#x27; pay. So Brown recommends, to give the British workers a special ration coupon for each ton of coal produced on Saturdays. Coupons of another color should be issued for each extra ton of coal produced on weekdays. America could supply these additional consumer goods. America could as well allocate the badly needed conveyor belts for the above ground pits and steel billets to British manufacturers of mining machinery.

== Food plan ==
The United Nations should agree upon a five-year-plan on the fundamental assumption that hard labor in the factory cannot be well done on a meager diet. Germany may need to import a billion dollars’ worth of food and agricultural necessities each year. The aim should be increasing German food consumption, increasingly paid for by Germany’s own exports. It should involve a steady decrease in American relief as Germany progressively gets upon her feet until relief ceases past five years entirely and her exports take up the full burden.

== Access to export ==
Germany must export twice as much per capita from Western Germany as she did before the war. In 1947 hundred million dollars out of 200 million dollars’ current exports is the export of German coal. Ten millions tons of coal should be used inside Germany to serve the converting industries and can therefore not get exported furthermore. There is a wide gap between necessary imports and exports to pay for raw material and food deficiencies. But even in 1947 Germany could resume her pre-war role as manufacturer of producer goods, which impressed the visitors of two splendid export exhibitions at Munich and Stuttgart. Re-sellers who knew their markets would have been glad to buy and distribute German goods. Brown recommended, that nations, which would re-establish the trade with Germany, should give parts of their currency to the International Bank for loaning this money to German industrialists. They could pay their loans back by export to these nations. 
Freedom should as well be given to two- or tripartite barter arrangements. The primitive method of barter can quickly bring about an exchange of goods in absence of foreign currency. Germany could pay for the raw materials, not in currency, but in workmanship in finished product. German goods were desired by Sweden and Italy, but the exchange of products, that both countries needed, was prohibited by the then existing regulations. 

== Central Government, Central Bank, New Currency ==
Part of a plan for recovery in Germany is the establishment of a central provisional government. The government should have a demonstrated capacity to balance its income and outgo. Since in 1947 the Germans are not yet ready for holding an election for a parliament, the provisional government should be composed of the members of the Länderrat. These were the democratically responsible minister presidents of the several states, which have been established in each of the four zones. The Military Government should have a veto power against the selections of the Länderrat. 

Concurrently with a provisional central government should be established a strong central bank for issuing a new currency. Its branch banks should be operated under a strong unified policy and by experienced central bankers. A banking system for Germany patterned after the Federal Reserve System of America would be fallacious and would not provide a central bank that will accomplish what it must do in Western Germany. European bankers have had several centuries’ experience in running central banks and are thoroughly skilled in the central banking theory on the European pattern. 

A new currency should be issued with new plates for printing, so that the Russian printed currency cannot flow westward into Germany any more. Before issuing the new bank notes every effort should be made, to stimulate the production of consumer goods, so that the Germans could buy something with the new currency. A great barter market and a black market would be a great threat to the continued stability of the currency.

== Effects and legacy ==
The recommendations were gradually put into practice. In a Revised Plan for Level of Industry in the Anglo-American Zones the United States and Great Britain agreed to substantially increase the imports to 2.0 billion dollars and the export to 2.01 billion dollars. The overriding requirement of the plan has been to provide the level of industry necessary to make the area self-supporting. Therefore the annual production of billet steel was fixed at 10.7 million tons in 1947 instead of 5.8 million tons in 1946. The reconstruction of Western Europe created economies capable of a quick catch-up. The following influence of the Marshall Plan triggered Postwar Europe’s “supergrowth”. Brown recommended, that the other European nations qualifying for the Marshall-Plan should engage likewise in a diligent search for vital and important sectors of their economy, that were being blocked by shortages that produce vicious cycles that effects not only their economy, but that of all Europe. Emphasis should be given to minor crucial shortages like the conveyor belt shortage in Great Britain and the under-maintained journal boxes in the Ruhr area.

<text>Liberalism and radicalism are important political movements in Romania. Many political parties from these traditions have had important historical roles and substantial support, including representation in the Parliament of Romania. Not all Romanian political parties relevant to this tradition have explicitly described themselves as liberal or radical.

== Background ==

Liberalism has been one of the major political forces in Romania since the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. 

The first Romanian National Liberal Party (PNL) was active from 1875 until both its major factions were quashed in 1947 and 1950 by the communist government. The contemporary National Liberal Party (also PNL) was re-founded in 1990 after the Romanian Revolution. The centre-right PNL has had notable factions, splits and mergers, including the re-absorption of breakaway parties. For example, the right-wing and pro-German National Liberal Party–Brătianu reunited with the rest of the party in 1938 after splitting off in 1930. More recently, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE) split from the PNL and was a junior partner in a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party (PSD) between 2017 and 2019, before merging again with the PNL in early 2022.

<text>The Order of Ouissam Alaouite () or theSharifian Order of Al-Alaoui is a military decoration of Morocco which is bestowed by the King of Morocco upon those civilians and military officers who have displayed heroism in combat or have contributed meritorious service to the Moroccan state. The decoration was established on 11 January 1913 in replacement of the Order of Ouissam Hafidien. It is awarded in five classes: Grand Cordon (&quot;Grand Cordon&quot;), Grand Officer (&quot;Grand Officier&quot;), Commander (&quot;Commandeur&quot;), Officer (&quot;Officier&quot;) and Knight (&quot;Chevalier&quot;).

The Order of Ouissam Alaouite is similar to the Legion of Merit, awarded by the United States military.

==History==

The order of Ouissam Alaouite was created during the colonial period. The French authorities in Morocco considered it necessary to have the power to bestow an official honour or decoration in response to loyal service; and they wanted to avoid over-burdening the bureaucracy of the order of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur in Paris. The ribbon of the order during this period was a shade of orange or pumpkin-coloured. In 1934, a white stripe was added on each side of the ribbon.

During the Second World War, the Order of Ouissam Alaouite was awarded frequently to United States military personnel who had participated in the planning and execution of Operation Torch, the invasion of French Morocco. Morocco was a protectorate of France from 1912 to 1956, and the decoration was bestowed frequently on French military officers during that period.

After Moroccan independence in 1956, the Alawid Order became a prerogative of the Alawid King and his heirs. The Order continues through the present day, the original medal and the 1934&#x27;s ribbon unchanged.

==1943 ceremony==

In the opening scene of the film &quot;Patton&quot;, George C. Scott, portraying then-Major General Patton, is shown receiving the Grand Cross of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite. This was no mere Hollywood contrivance. Under Patton&#x27;s command, Allied forces took Casablanca after only four days of fighting. So impressed was the Sultan of Morocco that he presented Patton with the special Order of Ouissam Alaouite, with the citation: &quot;Les Lions dans leurs tanières tremblent en le voyant approcher&quot; (The lions in their dens tremble at his approach). Patton wryly described the ceremony as a &quot;non-military activity,&quot; but in his memoirs, he does not fail to note the Operation Torch staff officers who were similarly honored on that occasion.

<doc id="947875" wikidata="Q3296067" url="?curid=947875" title="Johns Manville">
<text>Johns Manville is an American company based in Denver, Colorado, that manufactures insulation, roofing materials and engineered products. For much of the 20th century, the then-titled Johns-Manville Corporation was the global leader in the manufacture of asbestos-containing products, including asbestos pipe insulation, asbestos shingles, asbestos roofing materials and asbestos cement pipe.

The stock of Johns-Manville Corporation had been included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from January 29, 1930 to August 27, 1982, when it was replaced by American Express. In 1981, Johns-Manville Corporation was renamed simply Manville. In 1982, facing unprecedented liability for asbestos injury claims, the company voluntarily filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Berkshire Hathaway bought the company in 2001, then chairman and CEO Jerry Henry retired in 2004. At that point, Steve Hochhauser became chairman, president and CEO. Todd Raba succeeded him in the summer of 2007; he came from MidAmerican Energy Holdings, another Berkshire Hathaway company. In November 2012, Mary Rhinehart was named president and CEO, and she added the title of chairman in 2014. In September 2020, Bob Wamboldt became CEO and president, while Rhinehart remained as chairman.

Today, Johns Manville is a manufacturer and marketer of products for building insulation, mechanical insulation, commercial roofing and roof insulation, as well as fibers and non-woven materials for commercial, industrial and residential applications. The company serves markets that include aerospace, automotive and transportation, air handling, appliance, HVAC, pipe and equipment, filtration, waterproofing, building, flooring, interiors and wind energy. Johns Manville has annual sales over $4.5 billion. The company employs 8,000 people and operates 46 manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe.

==History==
===Early years===
The present-day Johns Manville company traces its origins to two early manufacturers of construction materials. At the age of 21, Henry Ward Johns had already patented roofing and insulation products. In 1858, he founded the H.W. Johns Manufacturing Company in New York City. In 1885, the Manville Covering Company was established in Wisconsin by Charles B. Manville, whose grandson was the much-married socialite Tommy Manville.

In 1901, the H.W. Johns Manufacturing Company and the Manville Covering Company merged to form the H.W. Johns-Manville Company. In 1926, the firm was renamed to Johns-Manville Corporation. During the 1930s, industrialist Lewis H. Brown was president of the company. In 1949, the Canadian branch of the company was involved in the Asbestos Strike at its mines in Asbestos, Quebec.

In 1958, Johns-Manville bought Glass Fibers, Inc., based in Toledo, Ohio, from Randolph Barnard. This purchase propelled the company&#x27;s insulation division. At that time, Dominick Labino was working for Glass Fibers; Barnard and Labino both joined Johns-Manville. Glass Fibers had several plants in Waterville and Defiance, which are still in operation under Johns Manville,

Beginning just after World War II, sculptor Beverly Bender spent thirty-two years working in the art department of Johns-Manville, creating animal sculpture in her free time.

===Asbestos litigation and bankruptcy===
Starting as early as 1929, Johns-Manville employees began claiming disability from lung diseases. The claims settled out of court, with a secrecy order. In 1943, Samac Laboratory in New York confirmed the link between asbestos and cancer, but Johns-Manville suppressed the report. From approximately 1930 to 1950, attorney Vandiver Brown handled involvement in such lawsuits. Files and testimony alleged that &quot;[Johns-Manville] maintained a policy into the 1970s of not telling its employes that their physical examinations showed signs of asbestosis&quot;.

In 1943, Johns-Manville suppressed a report confirming the link between asbestos and cancer. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the company faced thousands of individual and class action lawsuits based on asbestos-related injuries such as asbestosis, lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Many new settlements included offering $600 for asbestosis, while the FAIR Act called for $12,000 for this condition level.

As a result, the company voluntarily filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982. At that time, it was the largest company in United States history to have done so. The filing shocked financial analysts, but a few, such as Gary J. Aguirre, had predicted the filing and had forced the company to post a bond to guarantee payment to their clients.

The bankruptcy was resolved by the formation of the Manville Trust to pay asbestos tort claimants in an orderly fashion by giving the trust the lion&#x27;s share of the equity in the company. The bankruptcy took over five years to process and resulted in protracted litigation. The Manville Trust is still in operation today.

===Post-bankruptcy===
The company emerged from Chapter 11 in 1988 as the Manville Corporation. In 1997, the company changed its name back to Johns Manville (but without the hyphen), and this is the name under which it does business today. In 2001, Johns Manville became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (, ).

In 2012, Johns Manville appointed a new CEO, Mary Rhinehart. She was the CFO for Johns Manville and had been with the company for over 33 years. In 2020, Bob Wamboldt became the president and CEO, while Rhinehart remained as chairman.

===Manville, New Jersey===
The town of Manville, New Jersey, is named for the company. It had a large manufacturing plant in the borough.

<text>Total Commander is an orthodox file manager, i.e. it features two file list panels (selectable via tab key) and a command line. It supports multiple tabs for each panel.

Total Commander is developed by Christian Ghisler and distributed as shareware or freeware, depending on the platform.

Total Commander, then called Windows Commander, was originally developed for Windows, using the programming environment Delphi. Current Windows versions are developed with Delphi (for 32-bit versions) and Lazarus (for 64-bit versions).

== Features ==
* archive file format support: 7zip, ace, arj, cab, gz, lzh, rar, tar, uc2, zip, and more via plugins
* file compare
* file encode / decode: mime, uue, xxe
* file filter
* file rename (including multi-file rename with wildcard and regex support)
* file search (with full text search), duplicate file search
* file split / combine
* file transfer protocol (FTP) client
* file tree operations: copy, delete, move, rename
* file viewer: any size in hex, bin, text with ASCII (DOS) or ANSI (Windows) character set
* quick view panel with image and video display
* synchronize folders
* thumbnails view

Total Commander supports extensibility via plugins, and it can bind external programs for viewing or editing files. Many plugins are freely available, e.g. different packer formats or file viewer for special file formats.
The Android version has plugins for direct access to external servers, which it presents as if they were simply local SD cards, making file copying from phone&lt;&gt;server trivial - currently Google Drive, Windows OneDrive, TotalDrip, LAN, SFTP and WebDAV are supported.
It also has an integrated media player that works both foreground and background - video and audio. Supporting most, if not all, file formats. 
Many functions not available by default are supported and can be assigned to icons. For example it supports device-&gt;device file transfer over WI-FI using an associated app.

== Platforms ==
* Windows
* Android
* Windows Phone, Windows Mobile / Windows CE

Total Commander is for the most part compatible with Linux using Wine.

== History ==
From 1993 until 2002, Total Commander was called Windows Commander. The name was changed in 2002 after Microsoft pointed out that the word &quot;Windows&quot; was their trademark.

<text>The Tax Foundation is an international research think tank based in Washington, D.C. that collects data and publishes research studies on U.S. tax policies at both the federal and state levels. Its stated mission is to &quot;improve lives through tax policy research and education that leads to greater economic growth and opportunity&quot;.

The Tax Foundation is organized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit educational and research organization, with three primary areas of research: the Center for Federal Tax Policy, the Center for State Tax Policy, and the Center for Global Tax Policy. The group is known for its annual reports such as the &quot;State Business Tax Climate Index&quot;, &quot;International Tax Competitiveness Index&quot;, and &quot;Facts &amp; Figures: How Does Your State Compare&quot;, which was first produced in 1941.

==History==
The Tax Foundation was organized on December 5, 1937, in New York City by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., Chairman of the General Motors Corporation; Donaldson Brown, GM Financial Vice President; William S. Farish, President of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (Exxon); and Lewis H. Brown, President of Johns-Manville Corporation, who later became the first chairman of the board of The Tax Foundation. The organization&#x27;s stated goal was &quot;to monitor the tax and spending policies of government agencies&quot;. Its offices were located at 50 Rockefeller Plaza and later 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

The Tax Foundation&#x27;s first project was a successful effort to stop a tax increase in Westchester County, New York, where they provided research and analysis (including an &quot;Expenditure Survey&quot; of state spending) to local activists. By 1943, the Tax Foundation had helped set up taxpayers associations and expenditure councils in 35 states.

During World War II, Tax Foundation research emphasized restraining government spending domestically to finance wartime expenditures. In 1948, the Tax Foundation opened an office in Washington, D.C., and in 1978 relocated there completely. Its research and analysis has historically emphasized publicizing federal and state financial information, arguing against the use of tax systems for &quot;social engineering,&quot; and urging &quot;broad bases and low rates&quot; tax reform.

Beginning in 1990, the Tax Foundation &quot;operate[d] as a separate unit&quot; of Citizens for a Sound Economy. By July 1991, it was again operating as an independent 501(c)(3) organization.

Beginning in 2009, the Tax Foundation&#x27;s offices were located in the National Press Building in Washington, D.C. In 2015, the organization moved to its current location on G Street.

==Goals and principles==
The Tax Foundation states that its research is guided by what it calls the principles of sound tax policy: simplicity, transparency, neutrality, and stability.

Tax Foundation research is generally critical of tax increases, high business taxes, excise taxes, tax preferences for the housing industry, and use of tax credits, which the Foundation views as &quot;picking winners and losers&quot;. The Foundation has spoken favorably of efforts to balance the federal budget with tax reform and significant spending cuts, such as the Bowles-Simpson plan, the Ryan Plan, and the Wyden-Coats plan.

==Organizational overview==
===Political orientation===
The Tax Foundation describes itself as an &quot;independent tax policy research organization&quot;. It is cited in the media as a nonpartisan or bipartisan organization, and is also described as business-friendly, conservative, and center-right.

===Board of directors===
As of 2023, the organization&#x27;s board of directors consists of David P. Lewis (chairman), James W. Lintott (treasurer), Bill Archer, Philip English, Dennis Groth, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Stephen Kranz, Sarah McGill, Pamela F. Olson, and Tom Roesser.

===Finances===
The Tax Foundation accepts grants from foundations, corporations, and individuals. It does not solicit or accept funds from government sources. The Tax Foundation has earned a 3 out of 4 star financial rating and 4 out of 4 star accountability and transparency rating from Charity Navigator.

==Activities==

The Tax Foundation publishes several major studies, including &quot;Options for Reforming America&#x27;s Tax Code&quot;, which details the economic and revenue impact of over 80 potential changes to the U.S. tax code.

The group uses its Taxes and Growth (TAG) macroeconomic model to simulate the effects of tax policies and produce conventional and dynamic estimates of potential changes in revenue, GDP, wages, employment, and the distribution of the federal tax burden. The TAG model is a &quot;neoclassical, comparative-statics economic model coupled with a tax return simulator&quot;. The economic model estimates supply of labor and cost of capital based on marginal tax rates calculated by the tax return simulator.

Since 2014, the TAG model has been used to analyze legislative and campaign tax proposals, including the Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed by Dave Camp, plans put forth during the 2016 presidential campaigns, the House GOP&#x27;s 2016 tax reform blueprint, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Since 2013, the Tax Foundation has offered guidance to same-sex married couples filing income taxes at the state level, where local laws recognizing same-sex marriage can vary considerably.

Every year, the Tax Foundation calculates and announces Tax Freedom Days in the United States. These studies have been criticized by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a progressive think tank, and in turn the Tax Foundation has responded to or criticized CBPP reports. However, the two groups have worked together on analysis of the marriage penalty in the US federal income tax.

The Tax Foundation praised the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as a &quot;pro-growth&quot; tax plan, citing GDP and job growth. However, the Foundation has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration&#x27;s trade policies, particularly tariffs.

==Reception==
In a column for &quot;The New York Times&quot; blog &quot;The Upshot&quot;, Josh Barro, a former Tax Foundation employee, criticized the group&#x27;s approach to scoring the RubioLee tax plan as producing &quot;implausibly rosy results&quot;. The Tax Foundation published a response to these criticisms, stating that their model results were &quot;in line with analysis done by other mainstream economists for similar tax changes&quot;.

In opinion editorials for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, economist Paul Krugman has characterized the Tax Foundation as &quot;not a reliable source&quot; while criticizing a report by the Tax Foundation comparing corporate tax rates in the United States to those in other countries. Krugman has also accused the Tax Foundation of &quot;deliberate fraud&quot; in connection with a report it issued concerning the American Jobs Act. The Tax Foundation has published various responses to Krugman&#x27;s criticisms.

<doc id="947891" wikidata="Q4920813" url="?curid=947891" title="Black Fury (character)">
<text>Black Fury is the name of several fictional comic book characters published in the Golden Age of Comics.

The first, John Perry, created by artists Dennis Neville and Mark Howell, appeared in Fox Feature Syndicate&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Comics&quot; in 1941. Perry is a gossip columnist who fights crime in his costumed alter-ego, Black Fury, assisted by Chuck Marley. The second Black Fury, appearing in &quot;Super-Magic Comics&quot; in 1941, is the secret identity of Rex King, an adventurer who can glide through the air and defends the African jungles with his pet black panther. The third Black Fury, a female criminal who battles the jungle goddess Rulah with trained panthers, debuted in Fox Feature Syndicate&#x27;s &quot;Zoot&quot; in 1947. The final Black Fury, a horse that rights wrongs in the Western United States, debuted in Charlton Comics&#x27; &quot;Black Fury&quot; in 1955 and ran for 58 issues.

==John Perry==
The first Black Fury premiered in Fox Feature Syndicate&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Comics&quot; #17 (April 1941). This version was created by artists Dennis Neville and Mark Howell. Black Fury is the alter ego of John Perry, gossip columnist for the &quot;Daily Clarion&quot;. Perry uses his newspaper connections to uncover information on crime and corruption, which he fights in his costumed form. He has no superpowers, and is assisted by Chuck Marley, the son of a slain policeman. The Black Fury and Chuck capture the Fang, who murdered Chuck&#x27;s father.

The Fox Black Fury character appeared in eight issues of &quot;Fantastic Comics&quot; until issue #23 (Nov 1941), and also appeared in &quot;V...- Comics&quot;&#x27; #1-2 (Jan-March 1942) and &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; #12 (June 1942).

==Rex King==
The second Black Fury appeared in &quot;Super-Magic Comics&quot; #1 (May 1941), published by Street &amp; Smith Publications. There were no writing or artists credited. Black Fury is the secret identity of Rex King, a costumed adventurer who can glide through the air, using the wing-like underarm flaps of his costume. He defends the jungles of Africa with the help of his pet black panther, Kato.

==Female criminal==
The third Black Fury was created by Matt Baker, and debuted in Fox Feature Syndicate&#x27;s &quot;Zoot&quot; #9 (Oct. 1947). This was a female criminal who used trained black panthers to battle the jungle goddess Rulah. She appeared in a story entitled &quot;Fangs of Black Fury&quot;.

==Charlton Comics==

The fourth Black Fury debuted in Charlton Comics&#x27; &quot;Black Fury&quot; #1 (May 1955). This character was a horse that roamed the West righting wrongs, bearing some resemblance to the 1955–1960 NBC Saturday-morning TV series &quot;Fury&quot; (for which Dell Publishing released a tie-in comic-book series). The Charlton comic featured artwork by Dick Giordano and Rocco &quot;Rocke&quot; Mastroserio and lasted 58 issues.

<doc id="947902" wikidata="Q7650884" url="?curid=947902" title="Suzanne Kaaren">
<text>Suzanne Kaaren (March 21, 1912 – August 27, 2004) was an American B-movie actress and dancer who starred in stock film genres of the 1930s and 1940s: horror films, westerns, comedies, and romances.

==Early life==
A native of New York City, she was born Sophie Kischnerman on March 21, 1912 in Brooklyn, New York. Kaaren attended Erasmus Hall High School and Hunter College before being signed by 20th Century Fox in September 1933. In 1931, she won a high-jumping contest in a New York City school contest. Her parents refused to let her compete in the Olympic Games. She collected butterflies as a hobby and had several books filled with the insects.

==Career==

===Early career===
She acted with stock companies and posed as a model for commercial painters and cigarette advertising. Kaaren appeared in dramatic parts in New York theaters and trained at the Hedgerow Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Early on, Kaaren was a Ziegfeld Girl and later was one of the original Rockettes. She performed on stage on December 27, 1932, the night Radio City Music Hall opened.

===Movie actress===
Kaaren left for Hollywood in October 1933. Her starting salary with Fox Films was $150 per week. She was eventually cast opposite Tim McCoy in &quot;Ridin&#x27; Gents&quot;, a Monogram Pictures production. She was then signed by Republic Pictures to play a character in &quot;From Rags to Riches&quot;. &quot;Ridin&#x27; Gents&quot; was filmed without either McCoy or Kaaren.

She joined a assembled by producer Walter Wanger, which also included Gloria Youngblood. The theatrical company was known as Trade Winds. The comedy &quot;When&#x27;s Your Birthday?&quot; (1937) showcased the zany Joe E. Brown, with Kaaren among the supporting players in an RKO Radio Pictures movie about an astrologer.


Kaaren figured prominently in several &quot;Three Stooges&quot; comedy short films. They are &quot;Disorder in the Court&quot;, &quot;Yes, We Have No Bonanza&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s the Matador?&quot;.

&quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; (1939) was based on the novel &quot;Death From A Tophat&quot; by Clayton Rawson. Kaaren plays a woman who is separated into halves and then joined together again suspensefully. The murder mystery has Robert Young and Florence Rice in prominent roles.

She starred opposite Bela Lugosi in &quot;The Devil Bat&quot;. The cult film of the horror film genre is a Poverty Row production released by Producers Releasing Corporation. In the movie, Lugosi breeds giant bats to attack people.

Her final appearance on film was an uncredited role as the Duchess of Park Avenue (Manhattan) in 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;.

===Theater===
Kaaren stepped into the character usually played by Ann Thomas in a Broadway presentation of &quot;Chicken Every Sunday&quot;. Staged in September 1944, Thomas left the production to go to Hollywood. In July 1946, Kaaren&#x27;s elder son, Brewster, was in the play with her as an eight-month-old. She was also joined by her husband, Sidney Blackmer, on stage at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. In April 1953, the Blackmers starred in &quot;Glad Tidings&quot; in Atlantic City, New Jersey. A month later, the show moved to the Quarterback Theatre, also in Atlantic City. 

In 1959, Kaaren appeared in &quot;The Royal Family&quot; at the Hinsdale Summer Theater in Chicago, Illinois. Linda Darnell starred; Karyn Kupcinet and Stuart Brent were also in the cast. The theme was a famous family of the American stage.

==Personal life==
Kaaren married stage and screen actor Sidney Blackmer on June 13, 1943, in a civil ceremony in Santa Ana, California. Raquel Torres was a witness at the wedding. Blackmer was married previously to Lenore Ulric. 

By this time, Kaaren was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The marriage was a turbulent one from the outset. The couple separated in September 1943 and Blackmer instructed his attorney to file for divorce in October, but the couple remained together until Blackmer&#x27;s death in October 1973. The marriage produced two sons, Brewster and Jonathen.

The Blackmers had lived in his family home in Salisbury, North Carolina, until it was damaged by fire in 1984. Afterward, she resided in a rent-controlled Manhattan apartment at 100 Central Park South. According to her obituary, real estate developer (and later the 45th president of the United States) Donald Trump bought the building and threatened to evict all the tenants and tear it down to build something more lucrative. Kaaren&#x27;s apartment was assessed at $750,000, but she refused to budge, and, in 1998, a court ruled that Trump could turn the apartments into condos, but had to allow the rent-controlled tenants to remain. She was, therefore, given $750,000 compensation.

==Death==
On August 27, 2004, Kaaren died from pneumonia at the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey, aged 92.

<text>Thomas Talbot (July 19, 1771February 5, 1853) was an Irish-born Canadian soldier and colonial administrator. He founded the community of Port Talbot, Ontario, which was at one time the most prosperous town in the region due to his insistence on building quality roads, and was responsible for enticing 50,000 people to settle in the Thames River area.

==Background==
Talbot was born at Malahide Castle in County Dublin, Ireland. He was the fourth son of Richard Talbot and Margaret Talbot, 1st Baroness Talbot of Malahide (see the Baron Talbot of Malahide). Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot de Malahide and Sir John Talbot were his elder brothers.

==Early military career==
Talbot received a commission in the army as ensign before he was twelve years old, and was appointed at sixteen to aid his relative, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He saw active service in Holland and at Gibraltar.

==Canada==
Talbot immigrated to Canada in 1791, where he became personal secretary to John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. After returning to England, Talbot convinced the government to allow him to implement a land settlement scheme along the shore of Lake Erie. He chose property which today is in Elgin County, Ontario in adjoining townships, Dunwich and Aldborough (today called West Elgin), when his petition for was granted in 1803. It was May 21, 1803, that he landed at a spot which has been called since Port Talbot, and built a log cabin. Nearby, he added a sawmill, a cooper shop, a blacksmith shop, and a poultry house along with a barn. When settlers began to arrive in 1809, Talbot added a gristmill as well.

Here he ruled as an absolute, if erratic, potentate, doling out strips of land to people of his choosing, a group that emphatically did not include supporters of the American Revolution, liberals or anyone insufficiently respectful. For every settler he placed on of land, Talbot received an additional for himself. He wanted permanent and compact settlement. One of the conditions attached to the free grant of , which he offered to settlers, was the right to purchase an additional hundred and at $3 each, and the promise of a road in front of each farm within three and a half years. The other condition was the building of a small house and the clearing and sowing of of land.

The result of the road-making provision was that the settlement became noted for its good roads, especially for that named Talbot Road. By the late 1820s Colonel Thomas Talbot had organized the construction of a road linking the Detroit River and Lake Ontario as part of a grand settlement enterprise in the south western peninsula. By 1820, all of the land originally allotted to Talbot had been taken up. From 1814 to 1837 he settled 50,000 people on of land in the Thames River area. Many, if not most, of the settlers were American. He had placed about 20,000 immigrants on the Talbot settlement by 1826.

Because he had done his work so well, the government placed the southwestern part of the province under his charge. This afforded Talbot the opportunity of extending the Talbot road from the Long Point region to the Detroit River. In 1823, Talbot decided to name the port after his friend Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, whose son, Frederick would become Canada&#x27;s governor general and donate to the ice-hockey world the trophy that still bears his name. According to returns placed before the House of Assembly in 1836, title to some located in twenty-nine townships had at one time gone through his hands.
Talbot&#x27;s administration was regarded as despotic. He was infamous for registering settlers&#x27; names on the local settlement map in pencil and if displeased, was alleged to have erased their entry. However, his insistence on provision of good roads (notably the eponymous Talbot Trail), maintenance of the roads by the settlers, and the removal of Crown and clergy reserves from main roads quickly resulted in the Talbot Settlement becoming the most prosperous part of the province. Eventually, however, he began to make political demands on the settlers, after which his power was reduced by the provincial government. Talbot&#x27;s abuse of power was a contributing factor in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837.

During the War of 1812, Talbot commanded the 1st Middlesex Militia. 

Talbot&#x27;s home in Port Talbot was called Malahide (which was demolished in 1997, generating much public outcry from heritage preservationists). Talbot died in the home of George Macbeth at London, Ontario, in 1853 and is interred in the cemetery of St. Peters Anglican Church near Tyrconnell, Ontario, in Elgin County. Talbot eventually moved to London where he lived until his death in 1853. When he died in 1853, at age 82, he had been visited at his historic home on Lake Erie by General Isaac Brock, Francis Gore, Mrs. Anna Jameson, Sir Peregrine Maitland, Sir John Colborne, Chief Justice Sir John Beverley Robinson, his brother the Honourable Peter Robinson, Dr. William Dunlop, Bishops Stuart and Strachan, Sir George Arthur, the Duke of Richmond, Lord Aylmer and many others. He lies buried at Port Talbot overlooking his beloved Lake Erie.
Talbotville (a community in Southwold, Ontario) and the city of St. Thomas, Ontario, were named after him, as well as Colonel Talbot Road and Talbot Street in both London and St. Thomas.

<text>Thomas Talbot (September 7, 1818 – October 6, 1885) was an American textile mill owner and politician from Massachusetts, United States. Talbot ran a major textile business, involving chemical dyeworks and the weaving of fabric, in Billerica that was a major local employer. As a Republican, he served in the state legislature, on the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council, and as the 29th lieutenant governor before serving for one partial term as acting governor of Massachusetts, and later for one full term as the 31st governor.

Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was minimally educated, working in textile mills from an early age. He entered into a partnership with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to issues with the mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor for part of the second term after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto of a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. He was more successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.

==Early life and business==
Thomas Talbot was born on September 7, 1818, in Cambridge, New York, to Charles and Phoebe (White) Talbot, both Irish immigrants, and was the seventh of eight children. When he was small, the family moved to Danby, Vermont, where his father supervised in a local textile mill. His father died when he was six, and his mother moved the family to Northampton, Massachusetts, where he attended local schools, and began to work at an early age in local mills.

In 1825, Talbot joined a weaving firm established by his older brother Charles in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as a carder and finisher, and quickly rose to become superintendent. His brother moved to Lowell in 1838, selling the Williamsburg mill, and began processing dyewoods in rented space at a local mill, while Thomas remained in western Massachusetts, working in area mills and continuing his education at an academy in Cummington. In 1840, the two brothers established C.P. Talbot &amp; Co., a business partnership that lasted until Charles died in 1884. The business started out processing dyewoods for use in the textile industry, but expanded into other industrial chemical processing in 1849. The brothers acquired the Concord River water rights of the defunct Middlesex Canal Corporation in 1851, and in 1857 they established Talbot Mills in North Billerica, Massachusetts, in partnership with the Belvidere Mill Company. The business was successful, and the brothers acquired full control of that business in 1862. Thomas focused on the textile business while Charles continued to manage the dye and chemical interests, expanding the facilities in 1870 and again in 1880.

The mill site in Billerica was not without some controversy. The dam, which had been constructed in the 1790s to provide water for the Middlesex Canal, was believed by some to be responsible for the flooding of fields upstream as far as Sudbury. There were calls to remove the dam, as well as legal action, which Talbot vigorously resisted. The dispute was partly played out in the state legislature, and brought Talbot to the attention of political leaders as a potential candidate for office. Talbot also opposed plans developed by the city of Boston to divert waters of the Sudbury River (a major tributary of the Concord River) for its water supply.

==Political career==
Talbot, a Republican, served in the Massachusetts legislature beginning in 1851, and sat in the governor&#x27;s council from 1864 to 1869. In 1872, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving two terms under William B. Washburn. On the selection of Washburn to the United States Senate by the state legislature in early 1874, he became acting governor. One item of unfinished business Washburn left to Talbot was a bill mandating a ten-hour workday. This matter had been the subject of labor agitation in the state, and Washburn had been opposed to the bill. Talbot, despite his mill ownership, was an advocate, and signed the bill into law. He also refused to authorize construction of a prison in Concord, and signed legislation allowing women to vote for members of local school committees.

The state&#x27;s liquor prohibition law was a major political issues at the time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed a bill that would have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law&#x27;s enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since it was the first victory for a Democrat in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party&#x27;s fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.

In 1878, Talbot won nomination as the Republican candidate for governor, in a large field occasioned by the impending retirement of Alexander H. Rice. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler&#x27;s return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election, in part by highlighting the wage and benefit differences in mills owned by Butler and Talbot. The campaign was particularly vicious, with Republicans attacking Butler supporters as &quot;Repudiationists, Greenbackers, and Communists&quot;. Talbot served one term, and refused to run for reelection the following year. He supported women&#x27;s suffrage and prison reform, and stronger state control over its railroads.

After leaving office, Talbot continued in public service, serving on the Health Committee of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, Lunacy, and Charity from 1880 to 1884, holding the chair of the committee in 1880–1882. As governor, Talbot had overseen the merger of the Board of Health, with the Board of Lunacy and Charity. Although this merger had been done ostensibly as a cost-saving measure, health care activists opposed it. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch, in particular, resigned from the merged board, complaining that it was dominated by business owners seeking to minimize discussion of pollution caused by their businesses.

==Family and legacy==
Talbot married twice. In 1848, he married Mary Howe Rogers, who died childless in 1851. In 1855, he married Isabella Hayden, daughter of Joel Hayden of Williamsburg, with whom he had seven children. He died at his North Billerica home in 1885, and was interred in Lowell Cemetery.

In 1905, the town of Billerica opened the Thomas T. Talbot Elementary School on 33 Talbot Avenue. The school would serve grades 1 through 6, until the 1972 when the 6th grade was migrated to the new middle school. The school continued to educate grades 1 through 5 until it closed in June 1980. It was renovated and reopened as the Talbot School Apartments that serves the elderly and disabled.

The surviving Talbot Mill properties in North Billerica are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Billerica Mills Historic District.

<text>Towersey Festival is an annual festival of folk, world music and traditional dance, previously held in the village of Towersey, relocated to neighbouring Thame in Oxfordshire, England through 2019. It moved to the Claydon Estate Middle Claydon in Buckinghamshire from 2020. It has taken place every August bank holiday weekend since its founding in 1965.

==History==

The festival set out as a fundraising event to rescue the decaying Towersey Village Memorial Hall – a building that commemorated the 14 men who had lost their lives in the First World War. In that first year (1965), it was a one-day village fete with morris dancing and a folk singing session in the pub barn. Its success can be measured by the money raised, the enjoyment of the day by the village residents and visitors, and by the fact that, in the following year, a three-day event was held.

The festival attracts approximately 10,000 people each year although the 2004 event (26 to 30 August) attracted much higher numbers than ever before. This is partly due to that year being the festival&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

The 40th &quot;Ruby&quot; festival ran from 26 to 30 August 2004 and featured appearances from Rory McLeod, Flook and Martin Simpson.

The venues/ stages in which festival activities take place include The Big Club (formerly known as the Concert Tent); The Festival Dance House (FDH); The Festival Green (formerly known as The Market Square and the Arena); and Venue 65. Other features include The Den (for storytelling and spoken word), the craft tent and the craft market, Creative Quarter and dedicated areas for children (5-11yrs) and youth (11yrs+).

Regular performers at Towersey include Roy Bailey and Les Barker. The latter made a live recording there in 1995 while Roy released Live at Towersey Festival 2015 during 2016. A Towersey Festival Patron, Roy performed at the very first festival, and his annual Monday afternoon concerts are greeted by capacity crowds. The Unthanks and John Spiers and Jon Boden had successful performances there in their early careers, while Eliza Carthy played her first solo show at the festival. Eliza said: &quot;Towersey gave me my first ever solo gig ... and one of the most memorable gigs of my life; a Chipolata 5 gig so full and rowdy that they had to take the sides of the marquee down.&quot;

Discussing the festival&#x27;s appeal and longevity, Roy Bailey stated: “Children play safely and many lifelong friendships have been developed here. People met here and got married here and generations of families return every year.”

The festival&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2014 was headlined by Richard Thompson. The anniversary was also marked by the publication of a book, &quot;Towersey Festival: 50 Years In The Making&quot; which explored the 50-year history of the festival, from its inception to present day.

Since 2015, the festival has been based at Thame Showground.

2019 saw the festival present an exhibition at Thame Museum entitled &quot;Capturing Towersey: Festival Photographs By Phil Sofer&quot; - a collection of images shot at the festival by the official festival photographer, Phil Sofer.

In April 2020 it was announced that the Towersey Festival would not go ahead in that year, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The event was postponed until August Bank Holiday 2021.

It was announced in May 2024 that that year&#x27;s festival would be the last, after 60 years.

==Towersey traditions==

Roy Bailey&#x27;s Monday afternoon concert, featuring invited guests, was a Towersey tradition until Bailey&#x27;s death in 2018. For the 2019 festival, the organisers announced a celebration of Bailey&#x27;s life, featuring many of the artists who had played as guests at his concerts.

The festival traditionally ends with a Festival Finale singalong in Venue 65, with the closing act leading the audience in a rendition of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot;.

Monday evening also sees the festival&#x27;s traditional Lantern Parade. The lanterns are made by members of the audience over the duration of the festival.

In a tradition dating to 1990, many men wear dresses on the last night of the festival. This began as a hen party for a Towersey regular, where the bride agreed that, due to the lack of female friends attending, men could attend if they dressed appropriately. The following year, the bride and groom held a Sunday afternoon cocktail party, before the Sunday evening session in the Barn, with guests asked to wear their wedding outfits. In time, this evolved into &#x27;Dress Up Sunday&#x27;. The bride still attends the festival regularly as a steward.

==Towersey releases==

The festival has released three compilation albums to date. The first was released in 1969, featuring acts recorded live at the 1968 festival, while the next two included (mostly) studio recordings of artists due to appear at the festival that year, and were released via digital distribution platform NoiseTrade.

<doc id="947911" wikidata="Q74616232" url="?curid=947911" title="Socage">
<text>Socage () was one of the feudal duties and land tenure forms in the English feudal system. It eventually evolved into the freehold tenure called &quot;free and common socage&quot;, which did not involve feudal duties. Farmers held land in exchange for clearly defined, fixed payments made at specified intervals to feudal lords. In turn, the lord was obligated to provide certain services, such as protection, to the farmer and other duties to the Crown. Payments usually took the form of cash, but occasionally could be made with goods.

Socage contrasted with other forms of tenure, including serjeanty, frankalmoin and knight-service.

The English statute &quot;Quia Emptores&quot; of Edward I (1290) established that socage tenure which passed from one generation or nominee to the next would be subject to inquisitions post mortem, which would usually involve a feudal relief tax. This contrasts with the treatment of leases, which could be lifelong or readily subject to forfeiture and rent increase. 

As feudalism declined, the prevalence of socage tenure increased until it became the normal form of tenure in the Kingdom of England. In 1660, the Statute of Tenures ended the practice of estates requiring owners to provide military or religious service, and most freehold tenures and other were converted into &quot;free and common socage&quot;.

The holder of a &quot;soc&quot; or socage tenure was referred to as a &quot;socager&quot; (Anglo-Norman) or S&quot;ocman&quot; (Anglo-Saxon, also spelt &quot;sochman&quot;, from the legal concept of a soke, from the verb &#x27;to seek&#x27;). In German-speaking Europe, the broad equivalent was a &quot;Dienstmann&quot;. The etymology of &quot;socage&quot; according to William Blackstone is the old Latin word for a plough.

<text>Aniracetam (brand names Draganon, Sarpul, Ampamet, Memodrin, Referan), also known as &quot;N&quot;-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone, is a racetam which is sold in Europe as a prescription drug. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States as a prescription medication or dietary supplement. Despite the FDA&#x27;s lack of approval, the drug is readily available over-the-counter in misbranded dietary supplements.

== Medical uses ==
Aniracetam has been used to treat dementia following stroke and in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. It has undergone a number of experiments in rodents; in a 1982 experiment on rats and mice it was found to have a variety of psychoactive effects, improving learning and memory that was otherwise impaired experimentally. It has been identified as a nootropic drug due to these memory effects. A 2001 study reported that in mice it has modest effects similar to an anxiolytic.

== Pharmacology ==
Aniracetam has been shown to positively modulate the AMPA receptor.

When ingested orally aniracetam is quickly broken down via first pass hepatic metabolism. The primary metabolites of aniracetam are &quot;N&quot;-anisoyl-GABA, (70–80%), 2-Pyrrolidinone and &quot;p&quot;-anisic acid (20–30%). There is some preliminary research suggesting that N-anisoyl-GABA and to a lesser degree p-ansic acid may contribute to the stimulatory effects of aniracetam in rats. Further work in rats suggests that N-anisoyl-GABA may contribute more to increasing acetylcholine release than aniracetam itself. For instance, a study using the forced swim test in rats found that the two metabolites 2-pyrrolidinone and N-anisoyl-GABA alone yielded similar anti-depressant effects as aniracetam itself. The authors of the aforementioned study hypothesized that the metabolites work by increasing levels of dopamine and by stimulating the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

Plasma concentrations are generally in the 5–15 &quot;μ&quot;g/L range for aniracetam and 5–15 mg/L range for &quot;N&quot;-anisoyl-GABA, a pharmacologically active metabolite, during the first few hours after oral administration of the drug. These two plasma species may be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

==Synthesis==
The drug was first made in the 1970s by Hoffmann-La Roche. Synthesis can be accomplished by reacting 2-pyrrolidone with anisoyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine.

Alternatively, gamma-aminobutyric acid can react with anisoyl chloride. Ring closure can be accomplished in the presence of thionyl chloride.

== Legality ==

=== Europe === 
Aniracetam is available by prescription in Greece (brand names Memodrin and Referan) and Italy (brand name Ampamet), where it is indicated for mental function disorders.

=== Australia ===
Aniracetam is a schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 4 substance is classified as &quot;Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by state or territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription.&quot;

<text>The Kölner Haie (English: &quot;Cologne Sharks&quot;) are an ice hockey club based in Cologne, Germany, that plays in the professional Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). The team was one of the founding members of the DEL.

The &quot;Kölner Haie&quot; play their home games in the DEL and the German Cup (DEB-Pokal) at the Lanxess Arena, which opened in 1998, located in the district Deutz. With room for 18,500 spectators, Lanxess Arena is amongst the biggest multi-functional arenas in Europe, and the &quot;Kölner Haie&quot; have the second highest average attendance in European ice hockey behind Swiss team &quot;SC Bern&quot;. Previously, the &quot;Kölner Haie&quot; played their home games at the &quot;Eisstadion an der Lentstraße&quot;. A strong local rivalry exists between the &quot;Kölner Haie&quot; and the &quot;Düsseldorfer EG&quot;, of neighboring Düsseldorf. Games between the two teams often sell out.

==History==
===1972 to 1976: Founding of Kölner EC===
In summer 1972, the hockey department of the &quot;Kölner EK&quot; (KEK), which made hockey in Cologne possible in different lower classes since 1936, separated from the family association. The members sought to play as an independent hockey association, due to the freedom of choice and better financial possibilities. On 10 August 1972, the independence of the hockey department was decided, and Peter Rentergent was appointed the president of the new &quot;Kölner Eishockey Club&quot; (KEC). 

The KEC remained associated to KEK, but as an independent department, and the team was to begin directly in the second division, then called the Oberliga. The KEK was a member in the German Ice Hockey Federation, granting them access to this division. The new association was to be called &quot;Kölner EC&quot; – to no avail, however, because of the resemblance to the &quot;Kölner EK&quot;. Hence, the addition &quot;Sharks&quot; was added to the logo, and years later, the association name. In the first logo, artist and the team&#x27;s goaltender, Dieter Horký sketched the shark. Today, the shark is the unmistakable brand image of the club, and since 1995, officially part of the name.

The team found immediate success in their first season, 1972-73. With strong players like Detlef Langemann, Wilhelm Hospelt, and player-manager Günter Peter, the team degraded opponents en route to winning the Oberliga, while coached by Ondrej Bendik. Kölner EC quickly rose to compete in the Eishockey-Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s top hockey league, in their 2nd season. In their first Bundesliga season, 1973-74, there was a fair share of problems in and around the team. These problems compounded when captain, Sigbert Stotz, was forced to retire due to an injury, furthering problems within the board of directors. Team manager Peter, plagued with financial troubles, fled from the town, and the team ultimately finished the season in 8th place out of 10. In the off-season, KEC fired the head coach Jiri Hanzl, and rehired Ondrej Bendík to the team. The 1974-75 season saw a jump in performance from KEC, while only finishing one spot higher in the final standings, 7th, the team was closer to a .500 winning percentage. 1975-76 saw sparks fly in the Sharks front office. At the beginning of the season in 1976, team president Rentergent submitted his resignation after he&#x27;d come under fire due to supposed payments to KEC&#x27;s amateur players. To add to this, in the middle of the season, head coach Bendík was dismissed because of persistent failure – the team&#x27;s attendance strongly decreased, leading to a financial deficit for KEC.

===1976 to 1983: the first success===
Despite the financial issues following the Sharks, they made a splash with a big transfer drawing attention to themselves. New team president Jochem Erlemann welcomed in Gerhard Kiessling as head coach, with his son Udo joining on defense. However, the purchase of Erich Kühnhackl of EV Landshut for the record transfer fee at that time of more than 600,000 DM was even more spectacular. Strangely in the obligation: multiple times, Jochem Erlemann had sent employees with money to negotiate with Kühnhackl to Landshut which achieved, nevertheless, no success. The star player still changed to Cologne. However, even as had set up of the KEC sportily in the top flight of the league, tax additional payments and debts became known at the rate of more than two million DM. Only by immediately initiated consolidation measures the association president succeeded in turning away the bankruptcy and in holding the play company straight. And thus the sharks in March 1977 managed the profit of the first mastery when one defeated, among the rest, the former standard master from Eisbären Berlin, as well as the Rhenish rivals from Düsseldorfer EG and Krefeld Pinguine in the master round introduced anew.

After the KEC did not manage the sighted title defence, the president obliged many new players., Among the rest, there came Miroslav Sikora who remained the following 20 years as a player and manager linked to the sharks to Cologne. Also Gerhard Kiessling, master trainer of 1977, returned to the sharks, after he had been dismissed immediately after the first championship unexpectedly. The sharks managed in the season the second title profit which was overshadowed, nevertheless, by the resignation of the president. Successor to Jochem Erlemann will appoint Heinz Landen, Clemens Vedder became the treasurer.

The next playing times stood in the sign of the sporty mediocrity as well as the financial consolidation of the association. In the season 1980/81 the Play out of vision qualification reached of the KEC though sportily, however, the team became because of the entanglement in the passport forger&#x27;s scandal (application of Canadians or American as German players, however, the German nationality had not moved) into the descent round. Moreover, on 9 March 1981 it came in the Bundesliga play against the VfL Bad Nauheim to a mass scrap. The referee covered including match punishments, play duration punishments and disciplinary punishments of a total of 166 penalty minutes.

Till 1983 formed an efficient team with young, ambitious players, as for example Miroslav Sikora, Gerd Truntschka, Uwe Krupp and Helmut de Raaf, as well as experienced players like Udo Kiessling and Uli Hiemer.

===1983 to 1988: four championships in five years===
With Jozef Golonka an experienced trainer was obliged who led the team in the finale of the playoff round where one hit on EV Landshut. The sharks defeated Landshuter EV with 5:0 in the fifth and determining play and celebrated the German mastery.

A year later the sharks begun once more as favorites had to be content with place three. On account of an injured person&#x27;s plight one lined up in the semi-final against the Mannheim ERC only with eleven healthy players. The season, nevertheless, was overshadowed by the foul of the inhabitant of Mannheim Roy Roedger who hit the KEC forward Steve McNeill with the racquet point in the right eye. Only thanks to several operations a part of the visual ability of the eye was saved. Roedger was closed for many plays and was condemned, finally, to a compensation payment at the rate of 200,000 DM. Moreover, the shark forward Peter Schiller provided for sensation, when he in the European cup play against the Bolzano HC which the KEC with 6:1 won, went from boredom with the puck behind own gate and made push-ups.

The season 1985/86, the first playing time in which the former shark player Hardy Nilsson stood as a trainer in the Cologne gang became one of the most successful ones of the association history for the KEC. From beginning the team dominated the league and went as a front runner to the playoffs. There one lost only one play, won in the first final series against the Düsseldorf EC (DEG) with 3:0 victories and celebrated once more the mastery. Before one had already booked in the European cup the second place. However, also this season a tragic secondary phenomenon had for the sharks: 19-year-old Ralph Philipp, nephew of the long-standing KEC forward Rainer Philipp, died with a car accident. Since then the tricot number 8 which had &quot;inherited&quot; the promising young talent from his uncle any more will not award with the sharks to player.

In the season 1986/87 a team since introduction of the playoffs succeeded with the KEC for the first time in defending her title gained in the season before. In the playoffs to which one had gone as a qualifying round second the sharks lost no play and defeated Schwenningen, the DEG and Mannheim in three plays in each case. Already before the season Clemens Vedder had removed his post as a treasurer for private reasons. A year later made the sharks to the Titelhattrick perfect when they won the fifth determining play with 4:1 in the finale of the Playoffs against the sports alliance of Rosenheim. With it they defeated the team which was better placed as only in the qualifying round. At the beginning of the playoffs set of the KEC a record unequalled till this day: Including three victories in each case against Frankfurt and Mannheim the team 20 won playoff plays in succession.

===1988 to 1994: the Rhine rivals===
After the triple titles, the Sharks were seen as favorites in the 1988/89 season, besides, they had stated the table after the qualifying round. After one had won the vice title in the European cup, nevertheless, the inhabitants of Cologne retired in the semi-final of the national mastery against the DEG. With the DEG one had exchanged before the season the goalkeepers (Joseph &quot;Peppi&quot; Heiss came for Helmut de Raaf), besides, during the season the changes were announced by Dieter Hegen and Gerd Truntschka to the Rhine rival. In the season 1989/90 everything seemed to run out again to the duel between both Rhenish rivals. The sharks booked at the end of the qualifying round place two behind the DEG. Indeed, retired of the KEC in the semi-final against Rosenheim. What remained, was a record existing still today: Nine play out of vision-half final participation in succession.

Also in both following playing times everything ran with the sharks not as planned. In 1990/91 the team had to fight with many injuries, however, the qualification for the playoffs still created as a front runner. There one reached by victories against Hedos München and the BSC Preussen the finale against the DEG. After the KEC had made up for 0:2-match remains, however, one was defeated in the determining fifth play with 0:4. In 1991/92 when the 19-year-old Jozef Stümpel began his international career, riots provided in the sphere from beginning for problems. Thus the surely believed removal of the ice stadium was rejected first by the town. Shortly after seasonal start left to Ray Whitney obliged scarcely the sharks in the direction of North America. When then the seasonal start failed, trainer Nilsson came under fire and after the elimination in the quarterfinal against Mannheim, a struggle for power began behind the scenery which culminated in resignations of several board members.

To the season 1992/93 it came again to financial bottlenecks with the &quot;Kölner Haie&quot;. In spite of some departures of players the team after the qualifying round reached the second place. In the Playoffs one asserted himself first against Kaufbeuren (3:0) and Mannheim (3:1), before one hit in Final once more on the DEG. In one of the most exciting final series of the Bundesliga history the determining fifth play won the DEG in Brehmstrasse in Düsseldorf with 2:1 after lengthening.

The financial problems of the sharks still worsened when president suffered landing shortly after end of the season a cardiac infarction and fell in the coma. The vice president anew appointed shortly before and manager collected subsequently nearly seven million DM of debts, player&#x27;s salaries were not partially paid any more. Besides, president landing announced his resignation at the end of the season 1993/94. Bernd Schäfer should redevelop first as an interim president, the association. In spite of the blind relations in the board of directors qualified of the KEC as a fifth certainly for the playoffs where one was defeated in the semi-final by the later master Hedos München.

===1994 to 2001: new league, new arena===
After the foundation of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), in which for the first time associations might also line up as a GmbHs, Heinz Hermann Göttsch assumed the office of the main companion and that of the chairman of the board at the Cologne hockey society founded anew &quot;The sharks&quot; Ltd. By extensive consolidation measures and donation actions of fans the sharks succeeded in getting some high-carat professionals to the Rhine. After a still disappointing qualifying round which the KEC on the sixth-place finished the team increased in the Playoffs of play to play and switched off Kaufbeuren, Mannheim as well as the Berlin Prussians. Finally, in the final series one defeated eV of Landshut in the determining fifth play with 4:0 and celebrated the first mastery of the DEL history.

In the season 1995/96 the association after place One after the qualifying round reached the finale once more where one hit once again on the DEG. However, after of the KEC the first play for itself had decided, no more other victory and it succeeded only the vice mastery remained. Besides, the sharks reached the final in the European cup which got lost against Jokerit Helsinki only in the penalty kick shooting in December 1995. A year later, also the team of the sharks had strongly been changed by the so-called Bosman decision, one was less successful in the European founded anew hockey league (EHL) and already retired in the group phase. In the DEL-Playoffs the team hit in the fourth year as a result of on Landshut. This time, nevertheless, Bavarians won the quarter final series in four plays.

There was a reunion already a year later when one met once more in the quarterfinal. Nevertheless, the sharks, after a streaky qualifying round with a lot of restlessness in the team and in the sphere as a third in the final gone, were to the Landshutern put under and won no play. Also in the next playing time, the sharks had moved in October 1998 in the just finished arena LANXESS (till 2008 &quot;Kölnarena&quot;), there were at the beginning many problems with the KEC. As in the year before players were dismissed shortly after start of the season, the team&#x27;s structure was not right and the achievements of the team stagnated. Only when with trainer Lahtinen, co-trainer Helland and manager Miro Sikora the complete sporty management had been exchanged, the manager later successful in the NHL Andy Murray provided for more Constance in the association and in the team. In the Playoffs to the mastery the sharks eliminated Lions after five plays, nevertheless, once more in the quarterfinal against Frankfurt.

In the season 1999/2000 the team of the sharks was valid according to many experts as one of the best ones which there was during the last years in the German hockey. Thus everything also ran first as desired: In December one won, as the first German team after 35 years, the top position and in the playoffs booked of the KEC the plumber cup in Davos, after the qualifying round the Augsburg panthers and Berlin Capitals were defeated without defeat. However, in the finale against Munich of baron there came the burglary, the sharks lost next three parts after the prelude victory and had to leave of the baron the title. A year later Scorpions had an influence on Hannover decisively about the seasonal course of the sharks: In January Bob Leslie was removed after a defeat against Scorpions for the second time from Lance Nethery on the trainer&#x27;s post. On one of the last matchdays qualified of the KEC with a victory against Hannover still for the play-offs, after one threatened to miss them for the first time. In the play-offs retired of the KEC in the quarterfinal then against Scorpions in three plays.

===2001 to 2006: successful years and the Zach era===
As during the years the sharks played a weak qualifying round before also in the season 2001/02. Worked out in the year of the 30-year-old association jubilee one fixed only in the end of the qualifying round the move in the final once more. There the sharks hit first on the Krefelder penguins whom one threw, nevertheless, in three plays from the competition. In the semi-final asserted itself of the KEC in five plays against Munich of baron. Also in the finale against the Mannheim eagles only the fifth play decided on the mastery. Norris with 2:1 won of the KEC by gates of Alex Hicks and Dwayne this and gained his eighth German mastery. The term of office of Hans Zach began with the aim title defence in Cologne. Already during the preceding season the engagement of the coach of the national team at that time was made perfect what entailed that Rich Chernomaz in spite of the championship title no future had in Cologne. The sharks already were convincing in the qualifying round which they finished after a final spurt (20 plays without defeat according to regular playing time) on the second place. This time over Kassel and Mannheim the finale reached of the KEC once more, against the Rhenish rival from Krefeld. After one had lost the first both parts, the team won herself the determining fifth play in the Cologne arena in which, nevertheless, the Krefelder defeated the sharks with 3:1. Besides, beside the vice mastery one stood in the finale of the DEB cup introduced again which one lost, however, against Mannheim.

After the successful last years the sharks were also valid in 2003/04 again to the favorites on the title in the DEL. And after the cup victory in 2004 against Kassel and the fourth place after the qualifying round, one expected a lot from the KEC team. However, from many injuries in the course of the season afflicted sharks could not counterhold in the quarter final series against Frankfurt Lions and failed because of the later German master. Many positive recollections of the season still remained, also because of the new association record of 6,500 sold season tickets as well as the foundation of the Alex&#x27; Hicks initiative by the shark forward. A year later – Rodion Pauels had become meanwhile a sports co-ordinator of the sharks – came once more From in the quarterfinal. After another season with many long time injured persons, the sharks booked the fourth place. In the Play-offs the sharks had to come too to themselves against one on account of the Lockouts with NHL players reinforced team of ERC Ingolstadt in the determining seventh play in the Cologne arena 2:5 hit give.

In the season 2005/06 it came after ten years for the first time again to one meeting with the DEG to the play-offs. After the sharks had finished the qualifying round on place 5 and had switched off in the quarterfinal in only four plays Nürnberg Ice Tigers, the half final series followed against the DEG. In the fourth play the sharks dated back shortly before end when Bill Lindsay allowed the lengthening in which he also marked the victory hit. Nevertheless, in the determining play in Brehmerstrasse the sharks were defeated with 3:5 and retired in the semi-final.

===2006 to present===
In the playing time in 2006/07 the season was also finished in the semi-final for the KEC. In the first year under the new trainer Doug Mason the inhabitants of Cologne played one of heights and depths stamped qualifying round, booked at the end, however, the fifth place and reached thus to 26. Times in succession the play-offs. In the cup finale the sharks, like already in 2003, against the eagles lost Mannheim after lengthening. However, the inhabitants of Cologne won the Play out of vision quarterfinal against the inhabitants of Ingolstadt better placed after the qualifying round, were defeated in the semi-final against later most eagle Mannheim. During the following season there was a spectacular goalkeeper&#x27;s change with the sharks: Travis Scott – till then statistically the best goalkeeper of the league – received a highly endowed offer of a Russian club and was transferred within less days there. As a substitute the inhabitants of Cologne obliged the German national goalkeeper Robert Müller from Mannheim. This led the KEC till the finale where they were defeated, however, by the polar bears Berlin with 1:3. Before the sharks had defeated acting most Mannheim in the quarterfinal as well as Frankfurt Lions in the semi-final. In the third play of the series against Mannheim both teams set nearly a new world record. Only after 168 minutes Philip Gogulla of the victory hits succeeded in the sixth lengthening.

During the summer break in 2008 there was with the KEC some restlessness, as a forward Ivan Čiernik launched a change in the KHL to HK Sibir Nowosibirsk, because he had been criticised supposedly by trainer Doug Mason. As a substitute with Čiernik the NHL ex-serviceman Mike Johnson whose contract was dissolved, nevertheless, already in December 2008 again was obliged thanks to the contacts by Todd Warriner. After seven successively lost plays to start of the season – to the worst seasonal start of the association history – trainer Doug Mason was dismissed. As a successor for Mason the management determined the former co-trainer Clayton Beddoes to whom with Andreas Lupzig an old friend was provided. In December 2008 separated the sharks also from Beddoes and the present promising trainer Rupert Meister was installed up to the seasonal end as a trainer. Nevertheless, the team in 2008/09 for the first time for 28 years did not reach the playoffs. On account of the weak abscission and the economic crisis stayed behind of the KEC far under his usual spectator&#x27;s cut what brought the sharks in a heavy financial crisis. For sensation provided of the KEC when he applied for short-time worker&#x27;s money in spring, 2009 for the employees of the office. Only by the engagement of new companions the insolvency procedure could be prevented.

On 21 May 2009 the Cologne sharks announced that her goalkeeper Robert Müller has died of a cancer illness. As a result, Müller&#x27;s number, the number 80, with the Cologne sharks was closed. After the Cologne sharks fell in the qualifying round in 2009/10 from the Playoff ranks and lost a large part of her plays, trainers Igor Pawlow and co-trainer Rupert master were released on 2 December 2009 from her duties and were substituted with the trainer&#x27;s team Bill Stewart and ex-shark player Niklas Sundblad. Nevertheless, still during the season was not clear whether the sharks can play this on account of a renewed deterioration of the financial situation to an end. After one had to make for the time being no application for insolvency, the club reached the first Playoff round, nevertheless, had to be against Ingolstadt ERC hit.

By the abscission bad once more and the finance problems the summer break became in 2010 for the fans the test of patience. Alleingesellschafter Heinz Hermann Göttsch had got out. He had pumped more than 17 years 30 million euros into the association. Nearly everyday announcements in the press about a forthcoming &quot;way to the district court&quot; or failed negotiations with potential new sponsors allowed to cook the rumour kitchen.

<text>The Homosexual Law Reform Society was an organisation that campaigned in the United Kingdom for changes to the set of laws which criminalised homosexuality at the time.

== History ==
In 1954, the Conservative government set up a Departmental Committee to look into aspects of British sex laws. The resulting report, the Wolfenden Report, was published on 3 September 1957.

On 5 March 1958, the academic A.E. (Tony) Dyson wrote a letter to &quot;The Times,&quot; published on the 7th, calling for reform of the law by the implementation of the Wolfenden Committee&#x27;s recommendations. The letter was signed by many distinguished people including
Clement Attlee,
A. J. Ayer,
Isaiah Berlin,
Trevor Huddleston,
Julian Huxley,
J. B. Priestley,
Bertrand Russell,
Donald Soper,
Angus Wilson and
Barbara Wootton.

The correspondence that this letter generated helped bring together supporters of the Wolfenden Report, and this led to the Homosexual Law Reform Society being founded on 12 May 1958 with members including Victor Gollancz, Stephen Spender, and Kenneth Younger MP. Most of the founders were not homosexual.

Advertisements inviting people who supported the Wolfenden Report to contact the Homosexual Law Reform Society resulted in Tony Dyson being joined by Antony Grey, businessman Nigel Bryant and architect Duncan Wright.

In May 1958, the related charity, the Albany Trust, was set up.

In October 1958, the Albany Trust opened an office, and the HLRS was able to use these facilities for its campaigning work.

The pamphlet &quot;Homosexuals and the Law&quot; was sent to MPs in preparation for their first debate on the Wolfenden Report. The first parliamentary debate was initiated on 4 December 1957 by Frank Pakenham (Baron Pakenham, later known as Lord Longford); however, it had become clear that the government had shelved the report and was not planning to implement any reform. The Lord Chancellor, Viscount Kilmuir, had said, &quot;I am not going down in history as the man who made sodomy legal.&quot;

On 12 May 1960, over 1,000 people attended the first HLRS public meeting in Caxton Hall in central London.

In 1962, Antony Grey became acting secretary of the HLRS. In the spring of 1963, this became a full appointment. Some people questioned the appropriateness of this appointment since Grey was a homosexual who was living with another man; there was concern that he might be subject to the same type of police attention that the organisation was campaigning against.

In 1963, the HLRS expanded to become a nationwide campaign, forming the North-Western Homosexual Law Reform Committee (NWHLRC) in Manchester under the leadership of Allan Horsfall. The North-Western Committee was the most radical and proactive of the HLRS’ groups, targeting trade unions and industrial workplaces and raising awareness of the Wolfenden Report. The NWC eventually formed the Committee, then formed the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.

The HLRS was most active during the campaign which led to the passing of the Sexual Offences Act 1967. For example, they provided advice and support to the Dorian Society of New Zealand; however, many (in particular the Campaign for Homosexual Equality and the Gay Liberation Front) considered that the new law did not go far enough and blamed the HLRS for what they saw as a weakening of the Wolfenden Committee&#x27;s proposals, calling the HLRS/Albany Trust &quot;a conformist outfit of Uncle Toms&quot;.

In March 1970, the HLRS became the Sexual Law Reform Society (SLRS) in order to campaign for further legal changes, particularly relating to the age of consent. In 1974, it produced a report for the Criminal Law Revision Committee on lowering the age of consent to 14, with the requirement that below the age of 18 the burden of proof that consent for sexual activities between the parties existed would be the responsibility of the older participant.

A. J. Ayer was President of the HLRS for a time; he remarked that &quot;as a notorious heterosexual I could never be accused of feathering my own nest.&quot;

<text>In biophysics, transduction is the of energy from one electron (a donor) to another (a receptor), at the same time that the class of energy changes.

Photonic energy, the kinetic energy of a photon, may follow the following paths:
* be released again as a photon of less energy;
* be transferred to a recipient with no change in class;
* be dissipated as heat; or
* be transduced.

<doc id="947935" wikidata="Q415099" url="?curid=947935" title="Oxiracetam">
<text>Oxiracetam (developmental code name ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and a very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States.

==Clinical findings==
Oxiracetam has been studied to determine if it has an effect on symptoms of dementia, but no consistent results were obtained in patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia or organic solvent abuse.

Patients with mild to moderate dementia experienced some beneficial effects, measured by higher scores on tests for logical performance, attention, concentration, memory and spatial orientation. Improvement was also seen in patients with exogenic post-concussion syndrome, organic brain syndromes and other dementias.

Oxiracetam-treated laboratory mice demonstrated a significant increase in spatial learning performance as determined by the Morris water navigation task, compared to controls. This increase in performance was correlated to an increase in membrane-bound PKC.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Oxiracetam is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 56-82%.
Peak serum levels are reached within one to three hours after a single 800 mg or 2000 mg oral dose, with the maximal serum concentration reaching between 19 and 31 μg/ml at these doses.

Oxiracetam is mainly cleared renally and approximately 84% is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The half-life of oxiracetam in healthy individuals is about 8 hours, whereas it is 10–68 hours in patients with renal impairment.
There is some penetration of the blood–brain barrier with brain concentrations reaching 5.3% of those in the blood (measured one hour after a single 2000 mg intravenous dose).

Clearance rates range from 9 to 95 ml/min and steady-state concentrations when 800 mg is given twice daily range from 60 μM to 530 μM.

The highest brain concentrations of oxiracetam are found in the septum pellucidum, followed by the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex and with the lowest concentrations in the striatum after a 200 mg/kg oral dose given to rats. Oxiracetam may be quantitated in plasma, serum or urine by liquid chromatography with one of several different detection techniques.

The major metabolites of Oxiracetam include: beta-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone, N-aminoacetyl-GABOB, GABOB (beta-hydroxy-GABA) and glycine. Thus its metabolic route is exactly parallel to that of piracetam, aniracetam, phenylpiracetam, and all other members of the -racetam family, and also pyroglutamic acid.

<text>Jānis Daliņš (5 November 1904 – 11 June 1978) was a Latvian race walker. Competing in the 50 km event he won a silver medal at the 1932 Olympics, becoming the first athlete to win an Olympic medal competing for Latvia. He also won the 1934 European title and set seven world records in the 1930s. At the 1936 Olympics he led the race at 30 km, but abandoned the race due to a leg injury. 

== Biography ==
Daliņš started late, and had his first competition at the age of 22. A few months later he set a Latvian record in the 5000 m walk. He finished second behind Ugo Frigerio in the 7 miles walk event and third behind Alf Pope in the 2 miles walk event at the 1931 AAA Championships. 

In 1932, he set his first world record, over the 25 mile distance and was later awarded the Order of the Three Stars 5th Class. Daliņš finished second in the 2 and 7 mile walk events at the 1933 AAA Championships.

After the 1936 Olympics Dāliņš semi-retired from athletics to work on his farm and raise his family. He resumed competing around 1940, and won the Latvian championships in 1942. In 1944 he moved from Latvia to Germany, where in 1947 he won his last race. 

In 1949 Dāliņš migrated to Australia, together wife Ella, daughter Rudite, and sons Ivars and Jānis. He was initially placed in the Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in north east Victoria. Jānis worked as a carpenter in the rural town of Benalla building many homes in post-war Australia. After completing his contracted time working in Benalla, he moved his family to Melbourne. There he raised his children, enjoyed his favourite hobby (fishing) and managed a sports club from 1959 to 1964.

== Legacy ==
Daliņš&#x27; success made race walking one of the most popular athletics disciplines in Latvia, with two more Latvians winning Olympic medals: Adalberts Bubenko in 1936 and Aigars Fadejevs in 2000. Daliņš is regarded as the best athlete of pre-World War II Latvia. A phrase: &quot;&quot;Ak, kaut man Daliņa kājas būtu&quot; (&quot;Oh, if only I had Daliņš&#x27; legs&quot;&quot;, originally the title of a 1930s song) remains widely known in Latvia. Daliņš remains a well-known name in Latvia, with a stadium and a street in his hometown of Valmiera bearing his name.

<text>John Downey Works (March 29, 1847June 6, 1928) was an American politician and lawyer. He was a U.S. Senator representing California from 1911 to 1917, and an associate justice of the California Supreme Court from October 2, 1888, to January 5, 1891.

==Biography==

Works was born in Ohio County, Indiana, and attended public schools there. During the American Civil War, he served as a member of the 10th Regiment of the Indiana Cavalry. Once discharged, he returned home, read law and in 1868 was admitted to the Indiana bar. In November 1878, he was elected as a representative in the Indiana General Assembly, serving during the 1879 term. In June 1883, he published a book of practice, pleading and forms to match the revised code of Indiana.

In 1883, Works&#x27;s poor health forced a move to San Diego, California, where he became active in the Republican Party, and rose in California politics. In September 1886, he ran on the Republican ticket, and prior to the election was appointed by Governor Robert Waterman as a judge of the San Diego County Superior Court. In September 1887, he resigned to return to private practice, and Governor Waterman appointed Edwin Parker to fill the vacant seat.

In 1888, Governor Waterman appointed Works as an associate justice of the California Supreme Court to fill a vacancy after the resignation of Elisha W. McKinstry. In August 1888, the Republican Party nominated Works and he was elected to the remaining portion of McKinstry&#x27;s term ending January 5, 1891. In 1891, after stepping down from the bench, Works became president of the San Diego Sun company, and then returned to private practice with his son in the firm of Works &amp; Works in San Diego.

In January 1896, Works moved to Los Angeles, California. In 1903, Works served as President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. On December 7, 1909, he was elected as a member of the Los Angeles City Council, and chosen as its president, but he resigned shortly after on March 22, 1910.

In 1911, Works was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served on the committee on Expenditures in the War Department (Sixty-second United States Congress) and the Committee on Fisheries. In February 1917, he and other Progressive Senators, under the moniker &quot;twelve willful men,&quot; blocked by filibuster legislation empowering President Woodrow Wilson to arm merchant vessels prior to the United States entering World War I.

Works did not seek renomination to his Senate seat in 1916. The Seventeenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, providing for U.S. senators to be elected by the people instead of state legislatures, had been adopted in 1913 but allowed senators serving at the time to finish their terms. Works was the last U.S. senator from California to be elected by the Legislature.

After retiring from the Senate he wrote two books: &quot;Duty to Man: A Study of Social Conditions and How They May Be Improved&quot; (1919) and &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With the World?&quot; (1922).

On June 6, 1928, he died in Los Angeles and his ashes were placed in Inglewood Park Cemetery.

==Personal life==
On November 7, 1868, he married Alice Banta, in Vevay, Indiana, and they had two sons, Thomas L. and Louis R., who became an attorney and practiced with his father, and later the presiding justice of the Court of Appeal, Second Division; as well as five daughters: Josephine (who died as an infant), Ida, Laura, Ethel and Isabel. He is said to have been a member of the Church of Christ, Scientist.

<text>The Albany Trust is a British organisation which describes itself as a &quot;specialist counselling and psychotherapy charity, focusing on a positive approach to sexuality and relationships&quot;. It was founded as a registered charity in May 1958 to complement the Homosexual Law Reform Society (HLRS).

== Current work ==
The goal of the Trust is to &quot;promote psychological health in men by collecting data and conducting research: to publish the results thereof by writing, films, lectures and other media: to take suitable steps based thereon for the public benefit to improve the social and general conditions necessary for such healthy psychological development.&quot;

The Albany Trust developed into a pioneering counselling organisation for gay men, lesbians and sexual minorities.

== History ==
It takes its name from the Albany, in Piccadilly, London, where J.B. Priestley and his wife Jacquetta Hawkes had an apartment, and at which the trust&#x27;s earliest meetings were held. The founding Trustees were A.E. Dyson, Jacquetta Hawkes, Kenneth Walker, Andrew Hallidie Smith, and Ambrose Appelbe

The funds raised and donated for the work of the Albany Trust allowed it to open offices in October 1958. These facilities, at 32 Shaftesbury Avenue, were then also available for the campaigning work of the HLRS. The longtime &quot;public face&quot; of these activities was Antony Grey, from 1962 Secretary of both the Albany Trust and the HLRS (the latter later being renamed the Sexual Law Reform Society).

After the Sexual Offences Act 1967 partially decriminalised homosexual relationships between adult men, the Albany Trust became an educational and counselling organisation. From 1967 the Trust was also involved the development of sex education. For example, this included support and advice for the Dorian Society of New Zealand.

The Albany Trust, with help from the Paedophile Information Exchange and the Paedophile Action for Liberation, published a booklet on paedophilia. The book was controversial, and campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse claimed that this showed that public funds were being used to subsidise pro-paedophile groups; however, PIE and PAL did not receive public funding directly.

<text>Pramiracetam is a nootropic agent belonging to the racetam family of drugs. It is marketed by Menarini under the brand name Pramistar as a treatment for memory and attention deficits in aging people with neurodegenerative and vascular dementias in Italy and some Eastern European countries.

Pramiracetam was discovered by scientists at Parke-Davis, at that time a division of Warner-Lambert, in the late 1970s; patents expired in 1996. Warner-Lambert conducted clinical trials in Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and abandoned that indication after Phase II trials showed mixed results; it then began to develop it as an orphan drug as an adjunct to electroconvulsive therapy for major depressive disorder, in part to take advantage of the administrative exclusivity provided by the orphan status. It licensed European rights to Menarini which continued developing it for dementias, and in 1991 it licensed US and other non-European rights to Cambridge Neuroscience, Inc, (CNI) which pursued the ECT indication, as well as a use in restoring cognitive function after stroke or traumatic brain injury. CNI obtained the orphan designation for the ECT use from the FDA in 1991, which was later withdrawn when CNI abandoned the drug.

CNI conducted a clinical trial in four people who had cognitive problems following a head injury. Trials conducted by or on behalf of Menarini and Warner-Lambert included two small trials conducted in Ukraine, one in people with cerebrovascular disease and another in people with concussion. Another small trial was performed in Italy, on healthy people in whom amnesia was induced with scopolamine.

<text>Stephen Mallory White (January 19, 1853February 21, 1901) was an American attorney and politician from California. A Democrat, he was most notable for his service as a U.S. Senator from 1893 to 1899.

A native of San Francisco, White graduated from Santa Clara College in 1871, studied law, and became an attorney in Los Angeles. He became active in politics, and served as Los Angeles County District Attorney and a member of the California Senate. White was elected the Senate&#x27;s president pro tem, and when the lieutenant governor succeeded to the governorship after the incumbent&#x27;s death, White was acting lieutenant governor for most of his state senate term.

In 1893, the California legislature elected White to the United States Senate. He served one term and was chairman of the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands. As a senator, White was best known for his efforts to secure an improved harbor for Los Angeles, which became the Port of Los Angeles.

After his Senate term, White resumed practicing law. He died in Los Angeles on February 21, 1901, and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Early life==
White was born in San Francisco on January 19, 1853, the son of Francis J. &quot;Fannie&quot; (Russell) White and William F. White, a merchant and author who was also active in California&#x27;s government as a state bank commissioner and in other positions. White&#x27;s mother was orphaned early in life and raised by relatives in Florida, one of whom was Stephen Mallory. White was tutored by his father&#x27;s sister until he was 13, then attended a private school in Santa Cruz County. At age 16, he began attendance at St. Ignatius College Preparatory School in San Francisco, where he remained for a year and a half.

White graduated from Santa Clara College in 1871 and studied law in the Santa Cruz area with three established attorneys. He was admitted to the bar in 1874.

==Early career==
White settled in Los Angeles, where he established a practice. In 1882, White was a charter member of the Los Angeles County Bar Association.

As a defense attorney, White attained a high reputation, but he preferred work on civil cases to criminal trials. He was also active in civic organizations, including the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the Native Sons of the Golden West.

==State politics==
A Democrat, White served as Los Angeles County District Attorney from 1882 to 1884. He was a delegate to the 1888 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis, which re-nominated Grover Cleveland for president. In a sign of his growing national stature, White was appointed as the convention&#x27;s temporary chairman.

White was a member of the California State Senate from 1887 to 1891. He was president pro tempore for both legislative sessions and acted as acted as the lieutenant governor from September 1887 to January 1891, following Robert Waterman&#x27;s accession to the governorship. White was a trustee of the State Normal School at Los Angeles (now the University of California, Los Angeles) from 1887 to 1893.

==U.S. Senator==
In 1893, White was elected to the United States Senate. He served one term, March 4, 1893, to March 3, 1899. He was the first native Californian to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. During his Senate term, White was chairman of the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands. As a senator, White was most notable for his work during the Free Harbor Fight, the effort to secure a deep water harbor at San Pedro, which later became the Port of Los Angeles. White was a delegate to the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which nominated William Jennings Bryan. His leadership was again recognized when he was appointed the convention&#x27;s permanent chairman.

==Later life==
White was not a candidate for a second term in 1899 and resumed practicing law in Los Angeles. From 1899 to 1901 he served as a Regent of the University of California. White died in Los Angeles on February 21, 1901. He was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Family==

In 1883, White married Hortense Sacriste (1857–1935). They were the parents of six children, four of whom lived to adulthood:

*William S. (1885–1930)
*Estelle (1886–1967)
*Hortense (1888–1977)
*Stephen M. (1889–1890)
*Unnamed boy (1891–1891)
*Gerald Griffin (1895–1951), who was named for White&#x27;s paternal great-uncle, the noted Irish poet and novelist.

==Legacy==
Stephen M. White Middle School in Carson, California, opened in 1957 and is named in White&#x27;s honor.

A statue memorializing White was paid for by friends and admirers and installed outside the Los Angeles County Courthouse in 1908. In 1959, the old courthouse was condemned, and the White statue was moved to the grounds of the new courthouse. In 1989, the statue was moved to the entrance off Cabrillo Beach off Stephen M. White Drive in San Pedro.

Since 2019, individuals who object to White&#x27;s support of the Chinese Exclusion Act and other racist actions have advocated for the name of the school to be changed. They have also proposed removing the statue from public display.

<text>The Lester B. Pearson Building is an office building in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 125 Sussex Drive in the Lower Town neighbourhood and currently serves as the headquarters of Global Affairs Canada. It was officially opened on 1 August 1973 by Queen Elizabeth II. It is named after Lester B. Pearson, former Prime Minister of Canada and external affairs minister which has earned it the nickname &quot;Fort Pearson&quot;.

The building was designed by the Toronto-based architectural firm of Webb Zerafa Menkes and is described as &quot;late modern with an influence of Brutalism&quot;. The building consists of four &quot;towers&quot; ranging from 4 to 10 storeys, of which three are interconnected from the first to the fifth floor. In 2013, the Department of Public Works and Government Services designated the office complex a Federal Heritage Building for its &quot;historical associations, and its architectural and environmental values&quot;.

In 2019, work began towards renovating the building, with major changes being made to both the interior and exterior. Walls will be torn down and individual offices removed in favour of a new activity-based working model. The project is estimated to cost $700 million and is scheduled to be completed in 2028.

<text>Budel-Dorplein is a village in the municipality of Cranendonck, Netherlands. The village was established in 1892 for a zinc factory by Emile Dor.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1893 as Dorplein. It was established by Emile Dor who built houses for the workers of his zinc factory in 1892. The suffix -plein means square. The village was initially called Nieuwdorp.

The factory was built in 1892 and originally consisted of six ovens, a factory hall and an office building. Many more buildings were added later, and few of the original factory buildings remain.

The St Joseph Hotel was a building built between 1896 and 1898. The building contained a hotel for the workers at the factory, but also a boys and girls school, shops, a bakery and a recreational facility. The inside was modernised in 1950. In 1985, it was sold and is in use for asylum seekers.

The Catholic St Joseph Church was built in 1951 and 1952 and has two towers.

The village used to be owned by the factory until 1968, when it became public domain and one of the villages of the municipality of Budel. The inhabitants also received the right to buy their own house instead of renting it from the factory. The zinc factory is nowadays owned by Nyrstar.

<doc id="947984" wikidata="Q6106020" url="?curid=947984" title="J. Irwin Miller">
<text>Joseph Irwin Miller (May 26, 1909 – August 16, 2004) was an American industrialist, patron of modern architecture, and lay leader in the Christian ecumenical movement and civil rights. He was instrumental in the rise of the Cummins Corporation and in giving his home town (Columbus, Indiana) international stature with its modern architecture buildings.

==Biography==
Miller was born in Columbus, Indiana, to Hugh Thomas Miller, a college professor and politician, and Nettie Irwin Sweeney. He had one sister, Elizabeth Clementine Miller (1905–1996), who married Robert Stone Tangeman.

He was a 1931 graduate of Yale University and made Phi Beta Kappa. From 1931 to 1933, Miller studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Balliol College, Oxford, which made him an Honorary Fellow in 1974.

On February 5, 1943, he married Xenia Simons. They had three daughters, Margaret Irwin, Catherine Gibbs, and Elizabeth Garr, and two sons Hugh Thomas II and William Irwin. Margaret was married to Jonathan D. Schiller, co-founder of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. He had ten grandchildren – Jonathan, Zachary, Joshua, Benjamin, Aaron, Andrew, AnnaCatherine, Katherine, Laura, and Emily.

The Miller House in Columbus, which was designed by Eero Saarinen, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2000. After the death of Miller&#x27;s widow in 2008, the house was donated to the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 2009. The family&#x27;s Canadian summer home on Lake Rosseau near Windermere, Ontario, was also designed by Saarinen.
==Work==
Miller joined Cummins, the family business, in 1934. He was executive vice president from 1944 to 1947, president from 1947 to 1951, and chairman from 1951 to 1977. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific during the Second World War.

In 1950, Miller helped to establish the National Council of Churches (NCC) and later served as its first lay president (1960–63). Miller chaired the NCC&#x27;s Commission on Religion and Race, which coordinated organized religion’s support for strong civil rights legislation, and jointly sponsored the March on Washington. He led religious delegations that met with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to push for the legislation that became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In 1954, he established the Cummins Foundation and in 1957 made an offer to Columbus that the foundation would pay all the architects&#x27; fees for new public buildings in Columbus. Thus this small Midwestern city has buildings by Eero Saarinen, Eliel Saarinen, I.M. Pei, Kevin Roche, Richard Meier, Harry Weese, César Pelli, Gunnar Birkerts, and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, many of which feature extensive interiors designed by Alexander Girard. &quot;Some people have a tombstone at the head of their gravesite or the foot of it,&quot; Columbus resident William Beaver wrote. &quot;Mr. Miller had the whole town as a monument.&quot; The American Institute of Architects in 1991 declared Columbus America&#x27;s sixth most important city in terms of architecture. In addition to altruism, Miller used architecture to entice the best people to work for Cummins.

Miller served as a Trustee of the Ford Foundation and Yale University, and as a director of Chemical Bank. He established the Irwin-Sweeney-Miller Foundation, which supports numerous charities and institutions—notably, Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis and Emma Willard School, a leading girls&#x27; preparatory school in Troy, NY. The family&#x27;s business interests were widespread, and he served at various times as Chairman of Irwin Union Bank in Columbus IN, Union Starch and Refining Company, and Irwin Management Company.

Irwin Management was the family&#x27;s private wealth-management and services organization, funded from Mr. Miller&#x27;s large Cummins Engine Co. dividends and the income generated by other holdings. The group managed all of the family&#x27;s assets except Cummins Engine—which Mr. Miller managed personally, as President and later as Chairman. IMCO, as it was called, was divided into departments for Marketable Securities, Oil and Gas, Real Estate, Venture Capital, Financial Planning and Analysis, and Family Services. The company was staffed by about 20 professionals, many of whom had MBA degrees from the leading graduate business schools (e.g., Harvard, Columbia, Chicago, Carnegie-Mellon, Stanford, Oxford). In addition to financial management, the company provided staff services to assist Mr. Miller&#x27;s roles in philanthropic, foundation, directorship, and trustee positions. It was considered a high-status firm among MBA students, and there was spirited competition for jobs at IMCO upon graduation.

He was active in politics, persuading New York governor Nelson A. Rockefeller to run for president in 1968 (and served as national campaign chairman) and in 1972 he supported New York City Mayor John Lindsay&#x27;s presidential bid.

Miller also served as a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, the Ford Foundation, and was a member of the Yale Corporation, which governs the university. In 1986 he received the National Building Museum&#x27;s first Honor Award. He was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Legacy==
Upon Miller&#x27;s death in 2004, the National Council of Churches in the United States instituted an annual &quot;J. Irwin Miller Award.&quot; The award is presented annually to &quot;a lay person who has been a witness, through action in the world, to justice and other values affirmed by Christian faith, and who has demonstrated a commitment to church unity.&quot;

In 2016 Exhibit Columbus launched the J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize, an award given to artists, architects, and designers whose work is for the benefit of communities.

J. Irwin Miller aided in a donation of $1.5million of $2million for construction through the Irwin-Sweeney-Miller Foundation to Butler University, constructing the &#x27;Irwin Library&#x27; (1963, designed by Minoru Yamasaki).

<text>Channel District is a residential neighborhood in the City of Tampa that includes an entertainment complex, just east of Downtown Tampa, Florida. It is bordered by Ybor Channel on the east and Garrison Channel on the south. Channelside is a nickname for the entertainment complex &quot;Channelside Bay Plaza&quot;, within the neighborhood that includes shops, restaurants, and bars. It is located next to the Florida Aquarium, American Victory Museum, Port Tampa Bay (the launching point for cruise lines) and a short stretch on the Tampa Riverwalk to the Tampa Bay History Center. Also located in the district is the Amalie Arena (formerly the Tampa Bay Times Forum) where the NHL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning play their home games. The Arena also hosts concerts and other events. The center of the Bay Plaza has a large open court for live music, with views of the downtown skyline, cruise ships and the Port of Tampa. It also houses a Sony Giant Screen theater. The TECO Streetcar has several stops in the district. Also, NEVs are being utilized by startups to link Tampa&#x27;s core neighborhoods including Channelside. The Tampa Convention Center is located adjacent to the district to the west.

Twin 30-story upscale condos Towers of Channelside were completed in 2007, with many other mid and high-rises completed since. Saint Leo University opened an adult continuing education center, called the Tampa Education Center, in the Channel District in July 2011. More shopping and entertainment is planned for the area along with an urban sports park, to be named Madison Park. The side streets away from the bay plaza are becoming the focal points of the neighborhood, featuring many new restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. The Channel District also includes the Small Business Development Center at the University of South Florida.

Starting in 2010 the Tampa Attractions Association formed a tradition of coloring the Garrison Channel green for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day.

Sparkman Wharf is a recent addition to the Channel side area in 2018. This outdoor food hall is located on the waterfront. The Sparkman Wharf has options for food, drink, and outdoor seating.

Several official Super Bowl XLIII parties featuring celebrity appearances were held in the district.

<text>Spur Awards are literary prizes given annually by the Western Writers of America (WWA). The purpose of the Spur Awards is to honor writers for distinguished writing about the American West. The Spur Awards began in 1953, the same year the WWA was founded. An author need not be a member of the WWA to receive a Spur Award. Among previous Spur Award winners are Larry McMurtry for &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, Michael Blake for &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, Glendon Swarthout for &quot;The Shootist&quot;, and Tony Hillerman for &quot;Skinwalkers&quot;.

The Owen Wister Award for lifetime achievement in Western literature, first awarded in 1961, is also a Western Writers of America award, distinct from the Spur Awards.

Initially, there were five Spur Awards categories: western novel, historical novel, juvenile, short story, and reviewer. The categories have expanded and changed (or been renamed) over the years. There is no guarantee an award will be made in each category every year.
The 2015 Spur Awards have the following categories:

* Spur Award for Best Western Novel
* Spur Award for Best Novel of the West
* Spur Award for Best Western Contemporary Novel
* Spur Award for Best Western Historical Novel
* Spur Award for Best Western Traditional Novel

<doc id="948014" wikidata="Q17142196" url="?curid=948014" title="Order and disorder">
<text>In physics, the terms order and disorder designate the presence or absence of some symmetry or correlation in a many-particle system.

In condensed matter physics, systems typically are ordered at low temperatures; upon heating, they undergo one or several phase transitions into less ordered states.
Examples for such an order-disorder transition are:
* the melting of ice: solid–liquid transition, loss of crystalline order;
* the demagnetization of iron by heating above the Curie temperature: ferromagnetic–paramagnetic transition, loss of magnetic order.

The degree of freedom that is ordered or disordered can be translational (crystalline ordering), rotational (ferroelectric ordering), or a spin state (magnetic ordering).

The order can consist either in a full crystalline space group symmetry, or in a correlation. Depending on how the correlations decay with distance, one speaks of long range order or short range order.

If a disordered state is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, one speaks of quenched disorder. For instance, a glass is obtained by quenching (supercooling) a liquid. By extension, other quenched states are called spin glass, orientational glass. In some contexts, the opposite of quenched disorder is annealed disorder.

==Characterizing order==

===Lattice periodicity and X-ray crystallinity===

The strictest form of order in a solid is lattice periodicity: a certain pattern (the arrangement of atoms in a unit cell) is repeated again and again to form a translationally invariant tiling of space. This is the defining property of a crystal. Possible symmetries have been classified in 14 Bravais lattices and 230 space groups.

Lattice periodicity implies long-range order: if only one unit cell is known, then by virtue of the translational symmetry it is possible to accurately predict all atomic positions at arbitrary distances. During much of the 20th century, the converse was also taken for granted – until the discovery of quasicrystals in 1982 showed that there are perfectly deterministic tilings that do not possess lattice periodicity.

Besides structural order, one may consider charge ordering, spin ordering, magnetic ordering, and compositional ordering. Magnetic ordering is observable in neutron diffraction.

It is a thermodynamic entropy concept often displayed by a second-order phase transition. Generally speaking, high thermal energy is associated with disorder and low thermal energy with ordering, although there have been violations of this. Ordering peaks become apparent in diffraction experiments at low energy.

===Long-range order===

Long-range order characterizes physical systems in which remote portions of the same sample exhibit correlated behavior.

This can be expressed as a correlation function, namely the spin-spin correlation function:

: formula_1

where &quot;s&quot; is the spin quantum number and &quot;x&quot; is the distance function within the particular system.

This function is equal to unity when formula_2 and decreases as the distance formula_3 increases. Typically, it decays exponentially to zero at large distances, and the system is considered to be disordered. But if the correlation function decays to a constant value at large formula_3 then the system is said to possess long-range order. If it decays to zero as a power of the distance then it is called quasi-long-range order (for details see Chapter 11 in the textbook cited below. See also Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition). Note that what constitutes a large value of formula_3 is understood in the sense of asymptotics.

==Quenched disorder==

In statistical physics, a system is said to present quenched disorder when some parameters defining its behavior are random variables which do not evolve with time. These parameters are said to be quenched or frozen. Spin glasses are a typical example. Quenched disorder is contrasted with annealed disorder in which the parameters are allowed to evolve themselves.

Mathematically, quenched disorder is more difficult to analyze than its annealed counterpart as averages over thermal noise and quenched disorder play distinct roles. Few techniques to approach each are known, most of which rely on approximations. Common techniques used to analyzed systems with quenched disorder include the replica trick, based on analytic continuation, and the cavity method, where a system&#x27;s response to the perturbation due to an added constituent is analyzed. While these methods yield results agreeing with experiments in many systems, the procedures have not been formally mathematically justified. Recently, rigorous methods have shown that in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, an archetypal spin glass model, the replica-based solution is exact. The generating functional formalism, which relies on the computation of path integrals, is a fully exact method but is more difficult to apply than the replica or cavity procedures in practice.

==Annealed disorder==

A system is said to present annealed disorder when some parameters entering its definition are random variables, but whose evolution is related to that of the degrees of freedom defining the system. It is defined in opposition to quenched disorder, where the random variables may not change their values.

Systems with annealed disorder are usually considered to be easier to deal with mathematically, since the average on the disorder and the thermal average may be treated on the same footing.

<doc id="948018" wikidata="Q175788" url="?curid=948018" title="David Lane (white supremacist)">
<text>David Eden Lane (November 2, 1938 – May 28, 2007) was an American domestic terrorist, white separatist, neo-Nazi, and a convicted felon. A member of the terrorist organization The Order, he was convicted and sentenced to 190 years in prison for racketeering, conspiracy, and the violation of the civil rights of Alan Berg, a Jewish radio talk show host, who prosecutors claimed was murdered by a member of the group via a drive-by shooting with Lane acting as driver, though they were unsuccessful in getting murder convictions. He died while still incarcerated at the FCI Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Lane coined the &quot;Fourteen Words&quot;, a well known white supremacist slogan in North America. He has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as &quot;one of the most important ideologues of contemporary white supremacy&quot;.

==Background==
Lane was born as the third of four siblings in Woden, Iowa; he had a brother and two sisters. His father was an alcoholic migrant worker who was physically abusive toward his wife and children. Lane would later claim that his father forced his mother to engage in prostitution so he could obtain &quot;booze money&quot;, and that his older brother was rendered permanently deaf as a result of a &quot;beating gone awry&quot;. When Lane was four years old, his father abandoned his family. In 1944, his older brother was arrested after searching for food in a neighbor&#x27;s trash bins, and he and his sisters were placed in foster care. Lane was soon adopted by a traveling Lutheran minister, which resulted in Lane being separated from his two sisters. Lane described his adoptive father as a &quot;doctrinaire fundamentalist from the old school&quot;. 

Lane rejected Christianity, which he found boring. Inspired by Nazi religious beliefs, Lane later favored pagan beliefs as a more authentic ancestral &quot;white&quot; religion, as opposed to what he viewed as Jewish influenced Christianity. Travelling across the Midwestern United States with his adoptive family, Lane finally settled in Aurora, Colorado, where he attended Aurora Central High School. Originally aspiring to become a golf professional, Lane worked as a real estate broker until his license was revoked because he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t sell homes to coloreds in white neighborhoods&quot;.

Lane claimed that he first became attracted to women of the &quot;Caucasian race&quot; after befriending a blonde-haired girl in first grade. Lane stated that while he reenacted battles with his foster brother as a child, he portrayed a Nazi stormtrooper while his brother portrayed an American soldier. Lane was briefly a member of the John Birch Society before joining the Ku Klux Klan, becoming the organizer of the Denver unit of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1979. In late 1981, Lane became Colorado State Organizer of Aryan Nations.

Lane met Robert Jay Mathews in July 1983 at the Aryan Nations world congress. On September 22, 1983, Lane was among the nine founding members to be sworn into The Order, a white supremacist group whose mission was to &quot;deliver our people from the Jew and bring total victory to the Aryan race.&quot; The Order was accused of stealing over $4.1 million in armored car hijackings, killing three people (one of whom was Order member Walter E. West), detonating bombs, counterfeiting money, organizing militaristic training camps and carrying out numerous other crimes with the ultimate goal of overthrowing the &quot;Zionist occupational government&quot; they deemed in control of the United States and to &quot;liberate the Pacific Northwest as a homeland for whites&quot; in the process (see Northwest Territorial Imperative).

==Convictions and incarceration==
For his role in The Order&#x27;s crimes, Lane was sentenced to consecutive sentences totaling 190 years, including 20 years for racketeering, 20 years for conspiracy, both under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and 150 years for violating the civil rights of Alan Berg, a Jewish radio talk show host who was murdered on June 18, 1984. Berg was shot and killed in the driveway of his Denver home by three members of The Order. Lane was arrested on the evening of March 30, 1985, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. While he did not pull the trigger, prosecutors said Lane drove the getaway car and played a large role in the planning of Berg&#x27;s assassination.

Lane was also among 14 men prosecuted for seditious conspiracy in Fort Smith, Arkansas, but he was acquitted. Lane was considered extremely dangerous by the American justice system and was incarcerated at various times after his conviction in the United States Penitentiary, Marion, the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado, and the FCI Terre Haute.

While incarcerated, he had the Federal Bureau of Prisons ID # 12873–057. Lane wrote books and articles about gematria and the demographic and sociopolitical status of the white race for white nationalist periodicals and websites. With his wife and Ron McVan, he ran a publishing company called 14 Word Press in Idaho to disseminate his writings.

He was featured in &quot;Nazi Pop Twins&quot;, a documentary aired on July 19, 2007, on Channel 4 in the UK. In it, he was shown speaking by phone with Prussian Blue (the music act from the documentary) and termed them &quot;fantasy sweethearts&quot; and that he viewed them like daughters.

Lane&#x27;s earliest possible release date from prison would have been on March 29, 2035 (at age 96). He died on May 28, 2007, in FCI Terre Haute due to an epileptic seizure. On June 30, 2007, white supremacists held memorial demonstrations for Lane in cities across the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.

==Beliefs==

===Racial beliefs===
Lane stated that his beliefs can be best summarized by a slogan he called the &quot;Fourteen Words&quot;: &quot;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children.&quot; He also coined a second 14-word slogan: &quot;because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth.&quot;

====88 Precepts====
While he was in prison, Lane wrote the 88 Precepts as a treatise on his views on race, politics, and philosophy. Lane viewed these as the principles behind the two &quot;Fourteen Words&quot; slogans. The &quot;88 Precepts&quot; are critical of democracy and oppose government under the claim of taxation as theft. They also promoted servant leadership, a Deistic theological view, and rejected racial integration, calling it a &quot;euphemism&quot; for &quot;White genocide.&quot; Lane&#x27;s writing also sought to establish a white ethnostate in North America and in Eastern Europe. 

&quot;88 Precepts&quot; is one of several key texts, printed and distributed through 14 Word Press, including the &quot;White Genocide Manifesto&quot; (which contained 14 key points).

As in his other writings, Lane repeats the claim that white people are threatened by a lack of exclusive territorial hegemony and &quot;forced racial mixing&quot;. Lane viewed the United States government as part of a Zionist conspiracy.

Consistent with the restrictive gender roles which were practiced within Aryan Nations, precept 35 of &quot;88 Precepts&quot; regards homosexuality as unnatural and also views sex as an act of reproduction which should be performed for the sole purpose of increasing the size of the white population. Lane also considers sex as a motivation for male subjugation of women, who are expected to be subservient. Lane advises men to subjugate women via power and control of territory, and he also advises white men to take up arms for this purpose.

According to its web site, the United Klans of America viewed the 88 Precepts as &quot;a source for which we can ascertain lasting truths&quot;.

===Wotansvolk===

Lane was one of the founders of the Wotansvolk movement, a racist, neo-&quot;völkisch&quot; form of Odinism (or Heathenry) which he formed with his wife Katja in 1995 in order to promote his ideology which pursued a program of concerted outreach to prisoners. Wotansvolk combines an &quot;Aryan call to arms&quot; with an esoteric teaching, partially based on Jungian psychology, völkish philosophy, and National Socialism. Lane distanced himself from universalist Odinists (including &quot;folkish Asatru&quot;) who did not embrace &quot;survival of the Aryan race&quot; as a core part of the movement. Lane argued with Stephen McNallen, then leader of the Asatru Folk Assembly when Lane was alive. By 2017, McNallen came out with support for Lane&#x27;s 14 Words, quoting them verbatim.

Aiming to foment a white revolution, Wotansvolk endorsed &quot;leaderless resistance,&quot; a strategy which was popularized by Louis Beam, a Klan veteran and a longtime friend of the Lane family. However, 14 Word Press and Temple of Wotan are defunct organizations and as a result no longer have mailing addresses or websites, although Wotanism is still practiced by independent kindreds.

Portraying Sir Francis Bacon and Shakespeare as being &quot;adept in ancient divine wisdom&quot; and believing that the pyramids were built by &quot;Aryan architects&quot;, Lane taught a belief called the &quot;Pyramid Prophecy 666&quot;, which included the concept that a Bible code was inserted by &quot;Aryan adepts&quot; within the King James Version of the Christian Bible. Lane&#x27;s alleged deciphered code described him as being the &quot;man&quot; who is described in the Book of Revelation, with America being the Beast, but that belief was censored by Ron McVan and other strategists who believed that Lane&#x27;s Messianic / Anti-Christ claims would be counterproductive by &quot;turning off potential converts&quot;. Lane also issued a declaration called &quot;Moral Authority&quot;, which calls the United States a &quot;Red, White, and Blue travelling mass murder machine&quot; intent on committing genocide against white people. According to the declaration, &quot;true moral authority belongs to those who resist&quot; this purported genocide. Lane claimed that was the &quot;666 Sun Man&quot; and that America was the &quot;Beast&quot;, and that &quot;14-88&quot; was an integral part of coding in his &quot;Pyramid Prophecy&quot; and was fundamental Wotanism (with &quot;88 Lines and 14 Words&quot; being a supplement to 88 Precepts). 1488 is a combination of 14 as in Lane&#x27;s Fourteen Words and 88, a white nationalist/supremacist abbreviation for &quot;Heil Hitler.&quot;

<text>John Conness (September 22, 1821 – January 10, 1909) was an Irish-born American businessman who served as a U.S. Senator (1863–1869) from California during the American Civil War and the early years of Reconstruction. He introduced a bill to establish Yosemite National Park and voted to abolish slavery. His advocacy of Chinese immigration and civil rights cost him his constituency.

==Early life and education==
Born in Abbey, County Galway, Ireland, on September 22, 1821, Conness was the youngest of fourteen children. His father was Walter Conness, whom John described as &quot;a very dignified and intellectual man, one whom men of all positions came to for counsel: being also a man of rare courage and independence.&quot;

==Immigration and career==
In 1836 Conness arrived in the United States at age 15 as an immigrant. For more than a decade on the East Coast in New York, Conness learned to make pianofortes and also worked as a merchant. He emigrated to California in 1849 to join the excitement and promise of the Gold Rush.

He was among the thousands of &quot;forty-niners&quot; attracted by the Gold Rush in the Sierra Nevada, and the hundreds of thousands who quickly followed. For two years, he mined Mormon Island, and the Middle Fork of the American River, and was interested in the industry for the rest of his life. Having made a stake, he settled in the new community of Georgetown and operated a store selling supplies to miners.

The state was bustling with new people. In the 1850s, the Democratic Party was the only partisan organization, and it stretched to accommodate the many interests of the new residents. Elected to the State Assembly in the 1853–54 and 1860–61 sessions, Conness was nominated as the Anti-Lecompton Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1859 and the Union Democratic candidate for Governor in the 1861 election.

After losing to John G. Downey in the first election and Leland Stanford in the second, Conness was chosen by the legislature to fill the full term of U.S. Senator from California for the term beginning in 1863 (Senators were selected by state legislatures until the 17th Amendment was ratified in 1913).

A Douglas Democrat who later became a Union Republican while serving in the Senate, Conness earned President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s respect. The two men worked together on legislation Conness introduced to protect Yosemite National Park and Mariposa Grove. In addition, Conness gave support to Lincoln&#x27;s war measures. Lincoln once said of Conness that he &quot;is habitually careful not to say what he does not know,&quot; and described him on another occasion as &quot;one of our United States Senators, of high standing, whom I cheerfully endorse.&quot;

Conness was colleagues with Senators William M. Stewart of Nevada and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts the night Lincoln died. &quot;Upon hearing of the attack on Secretary of State William H. Seward, the three men ran to Seward&#x27;s lodgings. There they were turned away by a doctor who was attending to Seward, and they ran to the White House, where they heard the news that Lincoln had been shot. Conness declared that &#x27;this is a conspiracy to murder the entire cabinet&#x27; and directed soldiers to go protect Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.&quot; Conness had the honor of being a pallbearer at Lincoln&#x27;s funeral on April 19, 1865.

At the beginning of Reconstruction, Conness alienated some of his California constituents by advocating strongly for Chinese immigration and civil rights. At a time of rising anti-Chinese feelings in California, his was an unusual and unpopular view, and he lost support of his party. He strongly believed in justice for all immigrants.

In the Senate debate on the 14th Amendment, Conness said “We are entirely ready to accept the provision proposed in this constitutional amendment, that the children begotten of Chinese parents in California … shall be citizens.”

After his Senate term ended in 1869, Conness relocated to Boston, Massachusetts, a center of Irish-American life. He lived there the remainder of his life, for nearly four decades. He died in an insane asylum in Jamaica Plain, now part of Boston. After his death, he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Dorchester, Boston.

==Legacy and honors==
*Conness supported the federal land grants for Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove, founding what later became the Yosemite National Park.
*Mount Conness and Conness Creek in the Sierra Nevada were named in his honor.
*Conness voted for the amendments to abolish slavery and grant freedmen citizenship.
*He supported immigration and civil rights for Chinese in California.
*Last surviving pall bearer of Abraham Lincoln.

<doc id="948020" wikidata="Q209226" url="?curid=948020" title="2,4-Dinitrophenol">
<text>2,4-Dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP or simply DNP) is an organic compound with the formula HOC6H3(NO2)2. It has been used in explosives manufacturing and as a pesticide and herbicide.

In humans, DNP causes dose-dependent mitochondrial uncoupling, causing the rapid loss of ATP as heat and leading to uncontrolled hyperthermia—up to —and death in case of overdose. Researchers noticed its effect on raising the basal metabolic rate in accidental exposure and developed it as one of the first weight loss drugs in the early twentieth century. DNP was banned from human use by the end of the 1930s due to its risk of death and toxic side effects. DNP continues to be used after its ban and experienced a resurgence in popularity after it became available on the Internet.
==Chemical properties==
DNP has the chemical formula HOC6H3(NO2)2. As a solid, it is a yellow, crystalline and has a sweet, musty odor. It sublimates, is volatile with steam, and is soluble in most organic solvents as well as aqueous alkaline solutions. DNP is a member of the dinitrophenols chemical family.

DNP can be produced by hydrolysis of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Other routes of DNP synthesis include nitration of monochlorobenzene, nitration of benzene with nitrogen dioxide and mercurous nitrate, oxidation of 1,3-dinitrobenzene, and nitration of phenol with nitric acid.

A dust explosion is possible with DNP in powder or granular form in the presence of air. DNP may explosively decompose when submitted to shock, friction or concussion, and may explode upon heating. DNP forms explosive salts with strong bases as well as ammonia, and emits toxic fumes of nitrogen dioxide when heated to decomposition. DNP&#x27;s explosive strength is 81% that of TNT, based on the Trauzl lead block test. 
==Uses==
===Industrial===
Historically, DNP has been used as an antiseptic and as a non-selective bioaccumulating pesticide.

DNP was particularly useful as a herbicide alongside other closely related dinitrophenol herbicides like 2,4-dinitro-&quot;o&quot;-cresol (DNOC), dinoseb and dinoterb. Since 1998 DNP has been withdrawn from agricultural use. Currently, there are no actively registered pesticides containing DNP in the United States or Europe. Dinoseb is used industrially as a polymerisation inhibitor during styrene production. In 2023, the Home Office said it could not determine any legitimate industrial uses for DNP in the United Kingdom.

It is a chemical intermediate in the production of sulfur dyes, wood preservatives and picric acid. A precursor to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), DNP has also been used to make photographic developers and explosives. DNP is classified as an explosive in the United Kingdom and the United States.
===In humans===

DNP raises energy expenditure by 30 to 40 percent and causes a weight loss of per week. Although DNP is no longer in clinical use as a weight loss drug due to its dangerous side effects, its mechanism of action remains under investigation as a potential approach for treating obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Researchers developed a prodrug, HU6, which is metabolized to DNP in the liver to provide more stable blood concentrations. HU6 completed a phase II trial in which it produced significant reductions in liver fat and body weight in overweight people with elevated liver fat, without serious adverse effects. 

DNP is used by bodybuilders, fitness enthusiasts, and people with an eating disorder to lose weight. The user profile is similar to that of anabolic steroids; many perceive it to be effective and with manageable risks. Despite health warnings from regulators, DNP is readily available online sometimes under other names such as Dinosan, Dnoc, Solfo Black, Nitrophen, Aldifen, and Chemox. DNP is often sold in tablets containing 100 to 200 mg and may be sold alongside other substances such as anabolic steroids and thyroxine. It may also be found as a contaminant in other bodybuilding supplements not advertised as containing DNP. Online message boards provide information on dosage and regimens for DNP use, and describe the risks of taking the compound and provide advice on how to mitigate hyperthermia. According to a study published in 2023, the most commonly reported doses were between 150 and 300 mg/day. Between 2010 and 2020, reports of overdoses were higher in Australasia, Europe and North America than in Asia, Africa, and South or Central America.

It is also used as a suicide method.

==Biochemistry==

=== Mechanism of action ===
In living cells, DNP acts as a protonophore, an agent that can shuttle protons (hydrogen cations) across biological membranes. It dissipates the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, collapsing the proton motive force that the cell uses to produce most of its ATP chemical energy. Instead of producing ATP, the energy of the proton gradient is lost as heat. The inefficiency is proportional to the dose of DNP that is taken. As the dose increases and energy production is made more inefficient, metabolic rate increases (and more fat is burned) in order to compensate for the inefficiency and to meet energy demands. DNP is probably the best known agent for uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by ATP synthase gets disconnected or uncoupled from oxidation. 

DNP raises the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and lowers T4 (thyroid hormone) levels by increasing T4 metabolism and reducing thyroid hormone secretion. Because it binds to thyroxine-binding globulin, overall thyroid function may not be affected. DNP cannot substitute for thyroid hormone in myxedema.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Information about pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DNP in humans is limited. DNP is metabolized via nitro reduction. Its major metabolites are and  4-amino-2-nitrophenol. In overdoses, symptom onset can be as soon as 3 hours and the average time to death was 14 hours.

===As a pollutant===
Although many militaries are replacing traditional 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)-based explosives for insensitive munitions, DNP is a degradation byproduct of the IMX-101 insensitive munition used by the United States Army.

While the Meisenheimer charge transfer reaction is effective at detecting TNT, it is not effective at detecting many other explosives including DNP. Researchers are studying colorimetric detection and other methods for DNP to find if water or solids such as soils are contaminated with DNP. UiO-66-NH2 can be used to bind to and remove DNP from solution.

== Adverse effects==
DNP has a low therapeutic index, meaning that the dosage at which toxicity occurs is not much larger than that required to produce a desired effect. Individual tolerance to DNP&#x27;s harmful short- and long-term effects varies greatly. The most common adverse effect reported is a rash, which could be maculopapular, urticarial, angioedema, or an exfoliative dermatitis. Cataracts can form, causing a permanent loss of vision in days to months of usage, and permanent deafness has also been reported. Other adverse effects reported include peripheral neuritis, agranulocytosis, and neutropaenia. Negative effects on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and bone marrow can occur. In animal studies, DNP acted as a teratogen, mutagen, and carcinogen and caused developmental and reproductive harm. An unusually yellow coloring of the skin, mucous membranes, sclera, urine, stomach contents, and internal organs is an indication of DNP exposure, but does not occur in every case. Contact with skin or inhalation can cause DNP poisoning. Symptoms are typically mild with dermal exposure, but inhalation can lead to systemic effects, the same way as oral exposure.
===Overdose===
Overdose is extremely dangerous; cases reported to poison control centers had a 11.9 percent fatality rate between 2010 and 2020. Although the largest number of overdose deaths occurred in the 1910s and 1920s when the chemical was in more widespread industrial use, the substance&#x27;s use as a dieting aid has caused a number of fatalities in the twenty-first century: at least 50 overdose deaths were reported worldwide between 2010 and 2020. Although the lowest published fatal ingested dose is 4.3 mg/kg, a typical overdose death occurs at a higher level of exposure, around 20-50 mg/kg.

The first symptoms to appear are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and perhaps diarrhea. The typical overdose syndrome seen with DNP and other phenols is a combination of hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and tachypnoea. Because of the heat produced during uncoupling, DNP overdose will overpower the body&#x27;s attempt to maintain thermal homeostasis and cause an uncontrolled, fatal rise in body temperature up to as high as . The disruption of metabolism also leads to the accumulation of potassium and phosphate, potentially contributing to toxicity. DNP can cause T wave and ST segment abnormalities; heart muscle, kidney, and liver damage have been found on autopsy. According to an analysis of United Kingdom and United States overdose cases, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, acidosis, and agitation or confusion are independent predictors of overdose death. 

There is no antidote to DNP and management strategies are based on expert opinion and case studies. Treatment for overdose is supportive, and often involves aggressive cooling using methods such as ice baths and intravenous fluids. Grundlingh et al. recommend administering activated charcoal if the patient presents within an hour of ingestion and using intravenous vasopressors or inotropes to control blood pressure if necessary. Intravenous methylthioninium chloride can treat methaemoglobinaemia. Benzodiazepines can help control seizures and dantrolene has been used in an attempt to control hyperthemia. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been used on people who died of DNP overdoses but has no known successful outcomes.

== History ==
During World War I, munitions workers in France fell ill and some died from DNP exposure. Stanford University academic Maurice L. Tainter learned of DNP&#x27;s effect in raising the metabolic rate and causing weight loss and pioneered its use as a weight loss drug. Although he was aware of DNP&#x27;s narrow therapeutic index, Tainter tried the drugs on obese patients and published successful results in 1933; average weight loss was and most recipients did not report adverse effects. In 1934, Tainter estimated that at least 100,000 people had been treated with DNP in the United States during its first year on the market and there had been three reported fatalities connected to the drug. Tainter argued that DNP was highly effective in raising the metabolic rate (up to 50 percent) and avoided the negative circulatory effects of desiccated thyroid, another weight loss drug in use at the time. 
Other physicians were less optimistic about the adverse effects of DNP, and in 1935 the  American Medical Association&#x27;s Council on Chemistry and Pharmacy declined to list DNP in the &quot;New and Nonofficial Remedies&quot; on the grounds that its benefits did not exceed its risks to health. Reports of cataracts forming during DNP usage administered by a physician appeared the same year; in 1936 an ophthalmologist based in San Francisco estimated that 2,500 American women had gone blind from DNP use. Physician opinion turned against the drug, but many people bought direct-to-consumer preparations of DNP—marketed as a cosmetic rather than a drug to evade existing regulations.

DNP&#x27;s risks were highlighted in the &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot;, an exhibit assembled by the Food and Drug Administration to explain the limitations of existing American drug regulations. In 1938, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act increased the FDA&#x27;s ability to regulate drugs. DNP was deemed so toxic as to be banned for human consumption and in 1940 the FDA reported that there was no evidence of continued sale for this purpose. Nevertheless, it continued to be used for weight loss. William F. Loomis and Fritz Albert Lipmann discovered DNP&#x27;s mechanism of action and reported it in a 1948 publication.

Reports of its use increased in the twenty-first century after the drug became available on the Internet.

==Legal status==

DNP is banned for human consumption in many countries. Because it has some legitimate uses, in many jurisdictions, DNP is legal to sell, but not for human consumption. In Australia, all dinitrophenols were classified as Schedule 1 dangerous drugs in 1956. In February 2017, DNP was reclassified as Schedule 10, &quot;Substances of such a danger to health as to warrant prohibition of sale, supply and use&quot;. Since 1 October 2023, DNP has been classified as a regulated poison in the United Kingdom. It is a prohibited substance (class F4) in Brazil. In the United States, DNP is classified as an investigational new drug; it received orphan drug status for Huntington&#x27;s disease. DNP has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Association since 2015.

Petróczi et al. recommend against campaigns informing people of the risks of DNP because it could increase use of the drug. However, Sousa et al. argue that publicity campaigns in the United Kingdom in the early and mid-2010s reduced DNP usage. In 2015, Interpol and the World Anti-Doping Agency released an orange notice warning of the dangers of DNP.

In 1941, the Eastman Kodak Company, a bulk distributor of DNP, was investigated after some of its product was found in illegal diet pills. Nicholas Bachynsky, a Texas physician, provided the drug to patients under the name &quot;Mitcal&quot;. He was convicted of violating drug laws in 1986, but continued to work with DNP and was additionally convicted of fraud in 2008. In 2018, a seller in the United Kingdom was convicted of manslaughter for selling DNP for human consumption. The conviction was sent to retrial in 2020 by the English Court of Appeal, where the seller was, once again, convicted of gross negligence manslaughter.

<text>Eugene Casserly (November 13, 1820June 14, 1883) was an Irish-born American journalist, lawyer, and politician. He was the son of scholar Patrick S. Casserly, and he served in the United States Senate from California.

==Biography==

Eugene Casserly was born on November 13, 1820, in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland, and immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1822, settling in New York City. Casserly&#x27;s father prepared him for a college education and he attended and graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He subsequently studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1844 and began practicing in New York City. Casserly became editor of &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; and contributed to several newspapers in various cities.

Before moving to San Francisco, California, in 1850, Casserly served on the New York City corporation counsel from 1846 to 1847. Upon moving to California, he published the &quot;Public Balance&quot;, the &quot;True Balance&quot; and the &quot;Standard&quot;, and was elected State printer in 1851 before retiring from journalism and resuming his law practice. In 1854, he married Teresa, daughter of deceased merchant John Doyle. Together, they had three children, two sons and a daughter.

Casserly was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate in 1867, where he served from March 1869 until his resignation on November 29, 1873. In the U.S. Senate, he served as chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads during the 42nd Congress and the Committee on Engrossed Bills during the 42nd Congress and 43rd Congress.

After resigning from the United States Senate, Casserly resumed practicing law in San Francisco and served as a member of the California Constitutional Convention in 1878 and 1879. Casserly died in San Francisco on June 14, 1883, and was interred in Calvary Cemetery. He was subsequently re-interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California, in 1904.

<doc id="948025" wikidata="Q203669" url="?curid=948025" title="Zimmerit">
<text>Zimmerit was a paste-like coating used on mid- and late-war German armored fighting vehicles during World War II. It was used to produce a hard layer covering the metal armor of the vehicle, providing enough separation that magnetically attached anti-tank mines would fail to stick to the vehicle, despite Germany being the only country to use magnetic anti-tank mines in numbers. &quot;Zimmerit&quot; was often left off late-war vehicles due to the unfounded concern that it could catch fire when hit. It was developed by the German company Chemische Werke Zimmer &amp; Co (Berlin).

==Operation==
The coating was a barrier that prevented direct contact of magnetic mines with metal surfaces of vehicles. The magnetostatic field decreases very rapidly, with the cube of distance; the non-magnetic coating holds the magnet of the mine too far from the steel of the vehicle for it to adhere. The coating was normally ridged to increase the distance between the magnet and the armor even further, as the high points on the pattern increase the effective thickness of the coating while minimising additional weight.

The mixture had the consistency of a thick paste or putty. It was applied to the vehicle, usually at the factory, patterned, and then hardened with blow torches. There were many variations seen in application designs, from the regular ridge-shaped pattern, to a less common waffle-shaped pattern. The differences mostly related to the factory producing each type of AFV. For example, the waffle pattern was seen almost exclusively on Sturmgeschütz III assault guns. In general, vehicles already in service were not coated with Zimmerit.

==Deployment==
The German army introduced the &quot;Hafthohlladung&quot; anti-tank weapon in 1942. This consisted of a shaped charge warhead connected to a metal ring holding three powerful horseshoe magnets. Issued to infantry, the user would run up to the tank and place the device on any surface to which the magnets would stick. The user would then pull the safety pin and run for safety. The magnets not only held the mine to the vehicle but also provided the correct spacing between warhead and armor, allowing the penetrator jet to form properly. Concerned that the simple design could be easily copied in the USSR, or the possibility that many of these weapons could fall into the hands of their enemies, the German army began looking for ways to defeat such a weapon when used against their own vehicles.

&quot;Zimmerit&quot; was applied to some tanks and casemate-style closed-top self-propelled guns and tank destroyers produced from December 1943 to 9 September 1944. It was only rarely applied to open-topped AFVs. The rough appearance of the coating gave a distinct appearance; for one type, e.g. a shingle-like look.

&quot;Zimmerit&quot; was discontinued from factory application on 9 September 1944 and from field application on 7 October 1944. This was due to concerns that projectile impacts could ignite it. These proved false, but the order was never rescinded. Applying and drying the paste added days to the production of each vehicle, which was unacceptable as there was a shortage of tanks. 

Following the war, the British carried out trials of a similar material on Churchill and Cromwell tanks and some trials were conducted in Canada with a similar material applied to self-propelled guns but it was not implemented. No similar material was used on post-war tanks as the widespread use of man-portable HEAT rockets such as the bazooka made magnetic mines obsolete.

==Ingredients==

The paste was composed of the following:
* 40% barium sulfate – BaSO4
* 25% polyvinyl acetate – PVA (similar to wood glue)
* 15% pigment (ochre)
* 10% zinc sulfide – ZnS
* 10% sawdust

In the raw paste, polyvinyl acetate was used in the form of &quot;Mowilith 20&quot;, a 50% benzene solution. During the drying process, the benzene evaporated and the mixture hardened.

<text>Frank Putnam Flint (July 15, 1862 – February 11, 1929) was a United States senator from California from 1905 to 1911.

==Early life==
Frank Putnam Flint was born on July 15, 1862, in North Reading, Massachusetts, to Althea Louise (née Hewes) and Francis Eaton Flint. In 1869, his family moved to San Francisco, California, where he attended public schools. He had asthma. In 1888 he moved to Orange, then Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
In 1888 or 1890, he was appointed a clerk in the United States marshal&#x27;s office in Los Angeles, and began to study law. In 1892 he was appointed assistant United States attorney under Mathew Thompson Allen. In 1883 he resigned and formed a law partnership with Allen, Allen &amp; Flint, which lasted two years until Allen became a judge. In 1895, Flint and Donald Barker reformed the law firm as Flint &amp; Barker. In 1897 Flint was appointed United States attorney for the southern district of California, and served four years. Flint was active in Republican politics. He was a fruit-grower, politician and banker.

In Los Angeles he was a member of the chamber of commerce and of its law committee; a member of the Municipal League, the Sunset club, the California club, the Union League club, the Republican league, the Masonic order and Knights Templar. He attended the Presbyterian church, was a trustee of Occidental College, a director of two banks (Equitable Savings, Los Angeles National).

He served as United States Attorney for the Southern District of California from 1897 to 1901 and as a U.S. Senator from California from 1905 until 1911 as a Republican, and holds the distinction of being the 1000th senator in overall seniority. Flint served one term in the Senate and did not seek reelection.

Flint was elected as president of the board of trustees of Occidental College in 1914. Flint served as chairman of the National Boulder Dam Association and advocated for the building of the Boulder Dam (later renamed the Hoover Dam). In 1915, he became president of the Los Angeles Investment Company. He served in that role until his resignation in October 1928.

==Personal life==
On February 25, 1890, he married Katherine J. Bloss in Los Angeles; and they had two children. His brother Motley H. was postmaster of Los Angeles. Flint lived on Flintridge Avenue in Pasadena. He was a majority stockholder of Flintridge Country Club, but in 1927 withdrew his stake.

Flint died on February 11, 1929, aboard the &quot;S.S. President Polk&quot; near the harbor of Manila. His body lay in state at Los Angeles City Hall. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale.

==Legacy==
The city of La Cañada Flintridge, California, is named, in part, for him, as he was a developer of Flintridge, which merged with La Cañada in the late 20th century. As a senator from California, he played a great part in making the Mission style the official architectural style of government buildings in Southern California and played a major political role in bringing Owens Valley water to metropolitan Los Angeles.

<text>Capital South Coast was a regional radio station owned by operated by Global Radio as part of the Capital radio network. It broadcast to Hampshire from studios in Segensworth, Fareham. In 2019, Capital South Coast was replaced by Capital South following a merger with Capital Brighton.

== History ==

===Radio Victory===
Radio Victory launched as the first local commercial radio service in the South of England in 1975, transmitting to a small area around Portsmouth. The licence was re-advertised by the Independent Broadcasting Authority. The extended licence, now to include Southampton and Winchester, was won by Ocean Sound Ltd. Radio Victory ceased operations in June 1986, a couple of weeks earlier than the expiry date of its franchise, with a test transmission informing listeners of the closure.

===Ocean Sound===
Ocean Sound launched on 12 October 1986 from a new purpose-built broadcast unit, built in just a year, in a business park in Segensworth West, outside Fareham, Hampshire and near the M27 motorway, a strategic location to prevent bias towards the two major cities of Southampton and Portsmouth, as well as removing association with Radio Victory, who were Portsmouth biased, however, some staff were hired from Radio Victory, such as sales managers and a Head of News.

Two services were launched, Ocean Sound (West), using 103.2 MHz FM and 1557 kHz AM covering Southampton and Winchester, and Ocean Sound (East) using 97.5 MHz FM, moving from Radio Victory&#x27;s 95.0 MHz FM, and 1170 kHz AM serving Portsmouth and the surrounding area. Two stations launched, rather than one station, as then Managing Director David Lucas identified two potential audiences, the East area familiar with commercial radio (in the East area) and the West area familiar with BBC, specifically the popular BBC station, BBC Radio Solent. The East area sounded livelier and there was a more soft sound for the West. The two stations were later joined by a separate service provided for Winchester and the surrounding areas on 96.7 MHz FM, entitled Ocean Sound (North) - The Light FM, launched on 6 December 1987.

The two original stations shared daytime output with specialist programmes for each station, such as a Saturday evening Isle of Wight programme with Jean-Paul Hansford on the West station on 103.2, while Guy Hornsby&#x27;s Saturday Soul Club on East, with the North service having its own programmes initially between 6am to 2pm and then 5pm to 9pm also, but relayed West at other times. The new station&#x27;s slogan was &quot;We&#x27;re on your wavelength.&quot;

In 1987, as part of IBA&#x27;s demand to end simulcasting on FM and AM, the services were reorganised. The FM West service became Power FM and East service became Ocean Sound, with the respective AM services becoming The Gold AM. The North service became The Light FM.

===Power FM===
Power FM launched on Sunday 4 December 1988 at 10 am. Power FM was designed as a direct competitor to BBC Radio 1 in the area, with a heavy rotation of chart and Top 40 pop and mainstream dance, with quick hourly news and information. The station was a music-intensive approach designed to get at the emerging demand for chart music which wasn&#x27;t available locally, whereas sister station Ocean Sound now provided significantly more speech, coupled with slightly older adult contemporary music. The opening presenter line-up included Pete Wardman, Bernie Simmons, Chris Kelly, Adrian Lovett, Chris Pearson and Judy James. The launch of Power FM was one hour after that of Ocean Sound and The Gold AM so that the presenters on Power could say that they were Britain&#x27;s newest radio station.

Power FM went on to become a very popular radio station, hosting many events including Power in the Park on Southampton Common. Ten in all were held between 1995 and 2004. The station has had many notable presenters including Scott Mills, Jon Holmes, and Rick Jackson. Rick hosted the breakfast show for 11 years, starting as &quot;Rick&#x27;s Rude Awakening&quot; in 1997 and then co-hosted with Ana Schofield, Rachel Brookes and Donna Alos along with &#x27;street boy&#x27; Maximum Bob who joined the crew in 2001. Other presenters included Nik Goodman, Darren Parks, Mike&#x27;n&#x27;Rich, Des Paul, and Rik Scott. 

==Mergers and acquisitions==
In 1992, the station and its sister stations were subsequently merged with Sussex radio station Southern Sound to form Southern Radio plc, which was due to its location in a prosperous and commercially attractive area of England. The merger saw Ocean Sound and The Light FM merging to create Ocean Sound - Classic Hits, later Ocean FM, and The Gold AM and Southern Sound&#x27;s AM frequencies merging to create South Coast Radio.

In 1994, Capital Radio Group, looking for expansion possibilities, purchased Southern Radio plc, which led to on-air sound changes. Whilst sister-station Ocean FM would take on a softer sound, Power FM took on Capital FM&#x27;s long-established, successful and highly polished sound, with news bulletins at the top of the hour finishing with the sentence &quot;And that&#x27;s the way it is at (time)&quot;. In 2005, GWR and Capital Radio Group merged to form GCap Media. In 2008, GCap Media was bought by Global Radio.

===Galaxy South Coast===
As part of the purchase of the station by Global Radio, Ashley Tabor announced on 16 September 2008 that Power would be rebranded and become part of Global&#x27;s Galaxy Radio network on 22 November 2008. The station was rebranded one day early, 21 November at 3:45pm, becoming Galaxy South Coast, despite listener concerns about the station networking from other areas of the UK and the reduced localness of its predecessor.

The station&#x27;s share of audience dropped from 6% before the rebrand to 3.9% by May 2009.

Galaxy South Coast, as Power FM, went digital in 2003, airing on DAB digital radio in Southern Hampshire, along with sister stations Ocean FM, XFM and Gold (formerly Capital Gold), as well as Wave 105, Radio Hampshire (formerly The Saint), Traffic Radio (formerly broadcasting as Channel 9, which included Capital Disney, Southampton Hospital Radio and South City FM) and BBC Radio Solent.

In addition to airing on the former Power FM slot on the South Hampshire DAB multiplex, 2009 saw Galaxy South Coast added to DAB in Bournemouth, Cornwall, Kent, Exeter/Torbay, Plymouth and Sussex Coast, replacing chillout station Chill in these areas; at the same time, a number of other DAB areas switched away from Chill to carry Galaxy stations (generally Galaxy Digital).

===Capital South Coast===
The station was rebranded as 103.2 Capital FM on 3 January 2011 as part of a merger of Global Radio&#x27;s Galaxy and Hit Music networks to form the nine-station Capital radio network. Breakfast presenters Zoe Hanson and Paul Gillies retained their jobs with the relaunched station while Adam Inker moved from his weekday afternoon timeslot to host drivetime. The new station also saw the introduction of a new presenter of weekend mornings, Christian Williams, the former weekend overnight Hit Music network presenter based at Trent FM in Nottingham.
The &quot;FM&quot; has since been dropped on air and is simply known as 103.2 Capital.

On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed the station would be merged with Capital Brighton. From Monday 8 April 2019, local output will consist of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

The station&#x27;s local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London. All of Capital South Coast&#x27;s local presenters left the station.

<text>Thomas Robert Bard (December 8, 1841March 5, 1915) was an American political leader in California who assisted in the organization of Ventura County and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1900 to 1905 as a Republican. He is known as the &quot;Father of Port Hueneme&quot; for his efforts in building and expanding the city, as well as the first and only deep water port in the area. He is one of the founders of the UNOCAL company.

==Early life==
Born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, on December 8, 1841, Bard attended the common schools, and graduated from the Chambersburg Academy in 1858. He studied law in school, and before his graduation, he secured a job with Pennsylvania Railroad. Later, he became an assistant to the superintendent of the Cumberland Valley Railroad. Other business ventures included the grain business in Hagerstown, Maryland. During the early part of the Civil War, Bard served as a volunteer Union scout during the invasions of Maryland and Pennsylvania by the Confederates.

In 1865, Bard arrived in Ventura County, California, to develop his uncle Thomas A. Scott&#x27;s properties in Ojai. In 1867, Bard would become the first person in California to produce oil from a drilled well. The official Congressional Directory for 1903 notes that Bard &quot;has engaged in wharving and warehousing, banking, petroleum mining, sheep grazing, and dealing in real estate&quot;.

==Political career==

Thomas R. Bard moved to Ventura County, California, in 1864 and served as a member of the board of supervisors of Santa Barbara County from 1868 to 1873. In 1871, he was appointed as a commissioner to organize Ventura County. During this time, he purchased and subdivided Rancho El Rio de Santa Clara o la Colonia and laid out the plans for Port Hueneme, California, the future site of his Berylwood estate.

Bard was the California delegate to the 1884 Republican National Convention, and later served as the director of the California state board of agriculture from 1886 to 1887. In 1887, Bard became a founding board member of Occidental College. Elected as a Republican to the United States Senate on February 6, 1900, to fill a vacancy created by the death of Senator Stephen M. White, he served until March 3, 1905. Bard was unsuccessful in his 1904 reelection bid. During his term Bard served as the chairman of the Committee of Fisheries (for the Fifty-seventh Congress) and served on the Committee on irrigation (for the Fifty-eighth Congress). One of Thomas R. Bard&#x27;s notable acts during his time in office was to appoint George S. Patton to West Point.

==Family and later life==

Thomas R. Bard became a successful business man, and held profitable interests in several oil companies. Thomas R. Bard and his brother, Dr. Cephas Little Bard, established the Elizabeth Bard Memorial Hospital in Ventura as a memorial to their mother. His son, Archibald Philip Bard, became a noted physiologist and the dean of Johns Hopkins Medical School.

He died at his Berylwood home in Port Hueneme, California, on March 5, 1915, and was interred in the family cemetery on his estate. His remains were moved to Ivy Lawn Cemetery in Ventura, California, by the military.

<text>Heart Kent (previously Invicta FM) was an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Heart network. It broadcast to Kent from studios at John Wilson Business Park in Whitstable.

==History==

===Invicta in the 80s===

Originally, independent local radio in Kent was to be provided by two franchisees, one covering Maidstone and Medway, and the other covering East Kent. The companies that were awarded the licences to broadcast to these areas were Northdown Radio and Network East Kent respectively. The two companies merged on 26 March 1984. The company&#x27;s new name was taken from a failed bid for the East Kent licence, owned by former Radio 2 presenter Desmond Carrington, Radio Invicta Ltd. The new countywide station went on air as Invicta Sound at 6am on 1 October 1984. The first few seconds of broadcasting were marred by a sound mix up which meant that Magnus&#x27;s discussions with his production team were broadcast to the county.

The station output was described as &quot;Radio 2 cum Radio 4&quot;, featuring a mix of middle-of-the-road music coupled with a prominent news schedule where a news bulletin would last at least nine minutes.

The managing director of the company Cecilia Garnett was sacked after the first few months.

The station was relaunched as Invicta Radio in spring 1985.

The company&#x27;s studios, originally purchased by Desmond Carrington&#x27;s Radio Invicta Ltd, were based in an old warehouse, at 15 Station Road East in Canterbury, with a second, smaller base at 37 Earl Street in Maidstone. Originally, presenters generally had the option of choosing where to present their show from, depending on where they lived. Plus, in the Invicta Sound days, there was some separate programming for East and West Kent, including dedicated Drivetime shows for each half of the county. Some specialist shows could only be heard by one half of the county, including a classical music show and a programme aimed at children, called &quot;Kid&#x27;s Stuff&quot;.

In 1985, a general reorganisation of radio frequencies in Britain forced Invicta into changing a number of them:
* 103.8 MHz (West Kent) became 103.1 MHz
* 95.1 MHz (East Kent) became 102.8 MHz
* 96.3 MHz (Ashford) became 96.1 MHz
* 95.9 MHz (Thanet) and 97.0 MHz (Folkestone and Dover) remained unchanged.

The lack of a single high-powered frequency for the east of the county was because of international frequency clearance problems due to the proximity to France across the English Channel. Instead three low-powered transmitters were installed in Ashford, Folkestone/Dover and Thanet. This problem did not affect BBC national and local radio, which use a single high-powered site at Swingate, near Dover.

A few years after the rebranding of the station to Invicta Radio, the station became known as Invicta FM. Soon after, separate breakfast shows started to be broadcast to the following areas:
* East Kent / West Kent (from 15 Station Road East, Canterbury, and later from Whitstable)
* Ashford (initially from the Ashford International Hotel, Ashford, then from Canterbury, and later from Whitstable)
* Thanet (from 15 Station Road East, Canterbury, and later from Whitstable)

===Station split - the early years===

As required by the Home Office to end simulcasting on FM and AM, in March 1989, Invicta Radio became Invicta FM and a sister station, Coast AM began broadcasting on Invicta&#x27;s AM frequencies. Whilst the company name remained Invicta Sound plc, the expanding operation started to become known as the Invicta Radio Group.

Coast AM was an AOR/soft rock station under the leadership of ex-Capital Producer/DJ Kerry Juby with music programmed by Paul Stafford (Head of Music and &quot;Living on Rock&quot; presenter, 711pm weekdays). Eammon Kelly was the station&#x27;s first breakfast host. A few months after the launch, Coast AM was renamed &quot;Coast Classics&quot;. (Although the jingles sang &quot;Coast Classic&quot;). The service began playing more &#x27;oldies&#x27; and by 1990 it became a fully fledged &#x27;Golden Oldies&#x27; station. Throughout this period, Coast was a 24-hour live local station, but in 1991 it started taking a &quot;sustaining service&quot; from Chiltern Radio Group&#x27;s expanding AM &#x27;Gold&#x27; service, SuperGold. As a result of this change, the station was renamed Invicta Supergold. This helped as research had shown that listeners never fully got used to the station&#x27;s name, many still calling it Invicta. A near-identical set of jingles from JAM were re-sung with the station&#x27;s new name, and there were no major schedule changes. However, just before this change took place, and for most of Summer 1991, presenters at the station were instructed to call the station &quot;Coast Classics Invicta Supergold&quot; on air, to enable listeners to get used to the change. It became a highly popular station and once achieved a 17% reach in a JICRAR survey; some say much to the disgust of its Southern Radio bosses who, it has been said, preferred their AM stations to hover around the 9% mark.
It too lost its identity in 1998 when it became Capital Gold. As Invicta Supergold, the station performed very well and became home to ex Invicta FM presenters such as ex-breakfast presenter Johnny Lewis.

===Invicta in the 90s===

In 1991, controversy was sparked as one of the famous DJs, Chris Ryder (aka Caesar the Boogieman), was sacked over criminal charges related to theft from charity. He was ultimately found not guilty on these charges, but was convicted of intent to defraud

Also in 1991, the Maidstone studios and offices closed and a few months later, the entire company moved to a brand new, larger, building just outside Whitstable. This was due to the company getting too big for its Canterbury home having started to expand its radio operations beyond Kent. By now it had acquired a radio station in Frinton, Essex called Mellow 1557 (now known as &quot;Dream 100&quot;), as well as a stake in a radio station in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, which it had relaunched as Continental Invicta FM. Some of Invicta FM&#x27;s jingles were resung as &quot;Continental FM&quot; and voice overs appeared on the station by Invicta presenter Tim Stewart.

Shortly after moving to its current base, the station was acquired by Southern Radio plc which, in turn, was acquired by Capital Radio plc in May 1994. Mellow 1557 was sold by Southern Radio plc a few months after it took control of the Invicta Radio Group.

New rival commercial stations in the late 1990s were awarded licences in Kent by the Radio Authority. These were TLR (Thanet), Medway FM (Medway Towns), Neptune Radio (Shepway and Dover), CTFM (Canterbury and district) and KFM (Tonbridge and Sevenoaks). These new stations mainly adopted a much larger playlist of songs and, despite some major audiences successes (mainly Thanet) they gradually put extra pressure on Invicta&#x27;s advertising revenue. Most of the stations also employed many familiar ex-Invicta presenters. These stations are all now known as KMFM following buyouts by the KM Group.

===Station split - the later years===
When Chiltern closed its SuperGold sustaining service, Invicta FM and Invicta Supergold began sharing a single programme overnight. It retained its own separate identity by the use of split FM/AM jingles and an hourly out-of-news separate pre-recorded weather forecast, read over the respective station&#x27;s weather jingle. However, the presenter simply called it &quot;Invicta&quot; elsewhere in the hour. This usually ran from midnight or 1am until 6am, although the later launch of an &quot;early breakfast&quot; programme on Invicta FM meant the overnight presenter would do the last hour on Supergold only.

Invicta Supergold closed down May 1998, to be replaced by the mainly networked Capital Gold. The change happened with no promotion, save for a handful of promos scheduled to run over the weekend prior to the Monday launch. A local Drivetime show was retained, presented initially by Mike Peters, then Peter Fielding. This was ahead of the roll out of Capital Gold across other AM stations owned by the company; the Kent site acted as a test station, chosen in part because of its close proximity to Capital Gold in London, to ensure syndication worked, and to iron out any problems. Another change that occurred at the launch of Capital Gold in Kent is that for the first time, advertising was no longer split with different ads in the east and west of the county, as had been the case since 1984 - all ads now broadcast on the station are heard on both of the station&#x27;s frequencies.

By September, Capital Gold could also be heard in Birmingham, Sussex, Hampshire and, not long after, South Wales. A while later, the decision was taken to network the Drivetime show (presented by Tony Blackburn and instead local breakfast shows would be broadcast on each of the local Capital Gold services. Kent&#x27;s local opt-out show was then presented by Tim Stewart, who moved over from Invicta FM.

Ex-Radio 1 DJ Adrian John took over the Kent breakfast show in 2000.

A local breakfast show survived until August 2007, when Capital Gold owners GCap Media purchased the Classic Gold stations from UBC. Ofcom agreed a proposal to move the four-hour local opt-out from breakfast to afternoons. Kent&#x27;s breakfast show host by now was Neil Winfield who left the station and ex-Invicta jock Russ Lowe came in to present the 12-4 slot on weekdays. It was, and remains, pre-recorded (&#x27;voicetracked&#x27;) and &#x27;music heavy&#x27;. As it is recorded especially for the Kent audience of the now-renamed &quot;Gold&quot;; station, it is able to include occasional Kent information and other references to the county. Local news and travel remains in the Breakfast and Drivetime programmes, and local commercials are broadcast 24 hours a day. All other output is produced at the Gold studios at Leicester Square in London.

===Invicta in the 00s===

Capital Radio plc and GWR Group plc merged in 2005 and on 1 May that year, the newly enlarged group was renamed GCap Media plc. The first effects of the GCap merger were felt by Invicta FM soon afterwards. New boss Craig Boddy, assisted by GCap management (Hugh Murray and regional programme boss Peter Sinclair), undertook a radical restructure of the station in September 2005, in response to falling listening figures and mounting overheads. Boddy changed Invicta from the style influenced by nearby Capital FM, to one which roughly resembled the old Mix Network. Invicta was possibly the last local radio station owned by the company (outside London) to be live and local 24/7*, escaping overnight networking and voicetracking at times when Capital Radio-owned stablemates like Ocean, Southern and Power succumbed to one or the other.

(*Excluding the short-lived Steve Penk late night show heard across the Capital FM network, a Sunday afternoon show presented by Cat Deeley and Edith Bowman, and the weekly chart show, currently known as &#x27;The Big Top 40 Show&#x27;)

The new relaunched Invicta carried the first of the GWR straplines &#x27;The best mix of the 80s, 90s and today&#x27; from Monday 19 September 2005. The second strapline &#x27;Today&#x27;s Best Mix&#x27;, was introduced on Bank Holiday Monday 28 August 2006.

In May 2008, both Craig Boddy and Regional Programme Director Peter Sinclair left and in July 2008 former Invicta FM and KMFM Programme Controller Mike Osborne was appointed to the newly created role of Programme Director

On 30 June 2008, following the relaxation of OFCOM regulations on networking, the new owners of GCap Media, Global Radio, cut minimum local programming to ten hours on weekdays (from 6 to 10am and 1 to 7pm) and four hours on Saturdays &amp; Sundays (from 8am to 12pm). The changes signalled the end of some long-running programmes including &quot;Party Invicta&quot; and an increase in networked output, including the mid-morning show with Philippa Collins (aired from 10am to 1pm). Andy Walker presented the local 1pm4pm show until December 2008 when he was replaced by ex night time presenter Stephen Sullivan with Neil Kefford hosting the 4 pm7 pm slot.
In common with most of its sister stations, a lot of modern music and rocky/edgey music had by now been dropped by Invicta, in favour of a slightly and bigger concentration of older music, as far back to the late 1970s in a few cases and up to three 1980s songs an hour; sounding a bit like a younger version of another Global Radio station, Heart. All stations affected now shared the same playlist (e.g. Invicta FM played the same songs in the same order as sister station Essex FM). The strapline also mirrored Heart&#x27;s - More Music Variety - as did the name of the now renamed &#x27;guess the year&#x27; feature, The Time Tunnel.

===&quot;Heart is coming&quot;, 2009===

In September 2008, it was reported that Invicta, along with 28 other local radio stations, would be renamed as &quot;Heart&quot; with local programming reduced to Breakfast and Drivetime shows on weekdays and a four-hour show on Saturdays and Sundays. Whilst the station was still known on air as Invicta FM, airtime on the station was sold nationally as part of the Heart Network.

The station was amongst the final phase of stations to be rebranded, becoming Heart on 22 June 2009. Two months before the rebrand, the station was referred to as &quot;The Heart of Kent&quot;. Two weeks before the rebrand, all references to the Invicta FM name were removed, and trailers advertising &quot;Heart is coming&quot; were played after every song. This changed to &quot;Heart is here&quot; following the rebrand.

Heart network programming is overseen by group programme director of the Heart network, Luis Clark, who was programme director of Invicta FM between 1999 and 2000.

===Closure===
On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed Heart Kent would be merged with sister stations in the south and south east of England by the end of the year.

Under relaxed OFCOM requirements for local content, the station is allowed to share all programmes with another six licences located in the ITV Meridian region, which previously broadcast under three Heart stations (Solent, Sussex and Surrey and Thames Valley).

As of June 2019, regional output on the merged &#x27;Heart South&#x27; station consists of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. Heart Kent&#x27;s Whitstable studios closed with operations moving to studios at Fareham, Hampshire. Local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London.

Heart Kent ceased local broadcasting at 7pm on 31 May 2019. Heart South began broadcasting regional programming on 3 June 2019.

==Breakfast shows over the years==
For some time the station ran four breakfast shows from Whitstable - Invicta Supergold, Invicta FM (102.8 and 103.1 and in Dover on 97.0) Invicta FM Ashford (96.1) and Invicta FM Thanet (95.9). The different programmes all took the same news and sports bulletins but had different presenters.

The split FM breakfast was discontinued with the launch of The Invicta FM Morning Zoo in 1995. The Morning Zoo was the brainchild of then programme controller Sandy Beech.

For a time, commercial breaks continued to be split four ways on Invicta FM, with East, West, Thanet and Ashford as sub-regions.

The Morning Zoo was a fixture of the Invicta FM schedule for many years. Neil Francis was the initial lead presenter of the show until 2000 - he was later partnered with Sam Hughes (known on air simply as &#x27;Sam&#x27;). He was also joined by Mark Fox( Mark Anthony) in the flying eye.

From 2000, James Heming was the lead presenter of the Morning Zoo following the departure of Neil Francis. The last Morning Zoo was broadcast on Friday 22 December 2006. The breakfast show was rebranded &quot;James and Ali in the morning&quot; at the beginning of 2007.

From May 2008, it was known as &quot;James Heming in the morning&quot;, following Ali Wheeler&#x27;s departure from the station to have her first child. From November 2008 to December 2010, James had a new co host - Gemma Shepherd - and the show became known as &quot;Invicta FM Breakfast with James and Gemma&quot; and subsequently as &quot;Heart Breakfast with James and Gemma&quot;.

James gained Charlie O&#x27;Brien as his new co host on 21 January, and their new show started on 24 January 2011. O&#x27;Brien left Heart on Christmas Eve 2014 and was replaced by Becky Ives. Both Hemming and Ives left Heart Kent on 24 May 2019, one week before the station ceased all local programming.

<text>Heart Sussex (previously Southern FM, also operating as Heart Sussex for Crawley &amp; Surrey in Crawley and Surrey) was an Independent Local Radio station which was owned by Global Radio (formerly GCap Media) and played commercial, chart-oriented popular music. Broadcast and managed from studios and offices in Portslade, Brighton and Crawley, the station played a mix of pop, rock and RnB with the overall tag line being &#x27;The station for Sussex and Surrey&#x27; – replacing Mercury FM.

On 17 September 2008, it was announced that Southern FM was one of 30 local radio stations to face a re-brand to Heart within the next 18 months. Southern FM was rebranded as &quot;Heart Sussex&quot; on 22 June 2009. Mercury FM also merged with Heart in July 2010 to be re branded and re-launched as a sub-section of &quot;Heart Sussex&quot; operating as &quot;Heart Sussex for Crawley &amp; Surrey&quot; or simply &quot;Heart Crawley &amp; Surrey&quot; – sharing the same programming output.

==History==

The station launched as Southern Sound from the converted Rothbury Cinema in Franklin Road, Portslade. Under the leadership of managing director Keith Belcher and programme director Rory Macleod, early presenters included Sean Bolger, Louis Robinson, Stewart Macintosh, Vince Geddes, John Mann, Russ Williams and Becky Manesseh. The head of news at launch was Paul Woodley with a reporting team including Andy Steggall, Andrew Winter and Cornelius Lysaght.

Tommy Boyd joined the station, initially as a fill-in for Timbo (Tim Lloyd) and was subsequently hired to present a regular Sunday evening show with a team of assistants including Nicky Keig-Shevlin.

At the launch of the station, Southern Sound broadcast only to Brighton and parts of West Sussex. In 1987, transmissions were extended to Lewes, Newhaven and Seaford. Then on 5 February 1989, the station won a new licence for East Sussex too. Initially running split programming for East and West Sussex, the station now only splits for commercial breaks.

In 1994 the Radio Authority merged the two licences to become one official ILR licence.
The station broadcasts to the following areas:
* Analogue VHF FM
** 96.9 MHz - Newhaven Transmitter
** 102.0 MHz – Hastings Transmitter
** 102.4 MHz – East and West Sussex, including Eastbourne (Heathfield Transmitter)
** 103.5 MHz – Brighton and Worthing (Whitehawk Hill Transmitter)
* DAB Digital Radio: Block 10B 211.648 MHz
** Worthing (Findon Transmitter)
** Newhaven (Newhaven Transmitter)
** Hastings (Hastings Transmitter)
** Eastbourne (Eastbourne Transmitter)
** Chichester (Burton Down Transmitter)
** Brighton (Whitehawk Hill Transmitter)
** Crawley (Little Prestwood Farm Transmitter)
** East Sussex (Heathfield Transmitter)
** Central Sussex (Truleigh Hill Transmitter)
* Heart Crawley &amp; Surrey broadcast to the following areas on FM:
** 97.5 MHz – Horsham Transmitter
** 102.7 MHz – Reigate Transmitter

Since Heart and Mercury FM merged. Heart Sussex has taken over Mercury&#x27;s frequencies, on both the Reigate and Horsham transmitters.

==Network restructuring==

On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to merge Heart Sussex with the station Mercury FM as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 16. The newly merged &quot;Heart Sussex and Surrey&quot; station began broadcasting from Brighton on 26 July 2010.

The merged Heart brought the addition of an additional sub-station, Heart Crawley &amp; Surrey operates operationally separately. Sales are dealt with by a separate team (based in Crawley) – they may be based in Brighton in the near future though. In addition, to this Heart Crawley &amp; Surrey also has a different website. On air though, both stations broadcast/simulcast the same core coverage with the exception of adverts (and select news features). Mercury FM and Heart have now completed the switchover and for the time being are operating out of both addresses.

Radio House, Portslade, the previous home of Southern FM and recently a broadcasting station for Heart Sussex, was put on the market in 2019. Heart Sussex was to be merged with Capital Brighton radio station. The website is now called &quot;Heart&quot;, with a page for Sussex.

<text>Heart Oxfordshire (formerly Fox FM) was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Oxfordshire on 102.6 MHz FM from the Oxford transmitting station and 97.4 MHz FM from a relay station at Farthinghoe, near Banbury.

Originally launched in September 1989, it was rebranded on 23 March 2009 by Global Radio in line with its rebranding of most of the One Network, of which the station was formerly a part. The station was closed and relocated to the Heart Berkshire studios in July 2010 and rebranded again as &quot;Heart Thames Valley&quot;.

==History==
Fox FM was launched on Friday 15 September 1989 from an ex-carpet warehouse in Cowley, Oxford. Following weeks of test transmissions, its first song after official sign-in was Uptown Girl. The Fox name was said to be a contraction of the original company name, the &#x27;First Oxfordshire Radio Co&#x27;. The station was originally a joint venture between Blackwell&#x27;s Group, Oxford and County Newspapers (now Newsquest Oxfordshire), Capital Radio and County Sound Radio. Jeremy Loyd (General Manager of Capital) and Mike Powell (Managing Director of County Sound) were the driving forces behind the licence application that won the frequency. The original presenters were Phil Miles, Steve Ellis, Tony James, Jane Markham (the Fox Report), Steve Priestly, Paul Evans, Stuart Cameron, Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, Adrian Maughan and Claire Thomas. The Chairman was Julian (Toby) Blackwell and the Managing Director (MD) was Tom Hunter. In 1994, Sally Oldham became MD and Jean-Paul Hansford became the Programme Director (PD). The following year, the MD was Mark Flanagan and PD Phil Angell. In 1998, Capital Radio plc took full control of Fox, Lyn Long became MD and Alex Roland became P.D. followed 12 months later by Stuart Davies

In 2005, Fox FM became part of the GCap Media group, formed from the merger of GWR Group and Capital Radio. In 2006, GCap Media applied for a new FM licence covering Oxford and South Oxfordshire, with a service called Fox Gold. Following GCap&#x27;s takeover in 2008, Fox FM was integrated with Global Radio&#x27;s portfolio and rebranded Heart Oxfordshire on 23 March 2009. It was one of the 38 regional stations that formed One Network.

==Notable former presenters==

*Steve Priestley (now at Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire)
*Adrian Maughan
*Ali Jones
*Debbie Ryan
*Adam Ball
*Steve Penk (now at Happy Radio UK)
*Simon Ross now at Greatest Hits Radio
*Dan Mills
*James Heming
*Jo Thoenes
*Katy Hill
*Stephanie Hirst (now at Hits Radio)

==Network restructuring==
On 21 June 2010, Global Radio announced plans to close Heart Oxfordshire and merge the station with Heart Berkshire as part of plans to reduce the Heart network of stations from 33 to 15. The new station, &quot;Heart Thames Valley&quot; began broadcasting from Reading on 9 July 2010.

==Identity==
Like other stations in &quot;The One Network&quot;, Fox FM used similar idents - ending with the tagline &quot;More Music Variety&quot; which was later continued by Heart. The additional tagline of &quot;Haven&#x27;t you heard?&quot; was used on the website and advertising but not spoken on air.

Despite being part of GCap since 2005, it retained the logo devised by Capital until September 2007, although its logo after that date was more in keeping with other One Network stations. Originally, its logo was a cartoon fox called &quot;Freddy&quot; whose nose and tail were poking out onto a radio dial which became highly recognisable in the Oxford area as it was distributed widely on car window stickers.

==Local Heroes==
Fox FM rewarded notable people from the local area in their annual &#x27;Local Heroes&#x27; awards. In 2003, four winners received accolades - including Young Person, Local Hero and Special Award. Andrew Baker, a fundraiser for John Radcliffe Oxford Children&#x27;s Hospital in 2003 together with young singing star Zoe Mace in 2004. Fundraiser Jeff Samways and sea cadet volunteer Phil Pether were also amongst those honoured.

==Charity==
Over its last ten years of broadcasting, Fox FM raised thousands of pounds each year for their chosen charities in their &quot;Help An Oxfordshire Child&quot; campaign. In 2008, over £48,000 raised by its listeners, staff and partners was distributed out to many children&#x27;s charities. In the past, Oxford Children&#x27;s Hospital, The Oxfordshire Playbus and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society have benefited. Events held towards the campaign included the very first Oxford Santa Run, raising over £30,000, the Oxford Moonlight Stroll, an online auction and a charity football tournament held in Abingdon, as well as a celebrity football match at Oxford United&#x27;s Kassam Stadium in which a team of Fox presenters took on the stars from teen soap Hollyoaks in June 2008, as well as a greyhound race night, buggy trek and a charity premiere.

Help An Oxfordshire Child pledged £40,000 to name the Fox FM Outpatients Department in Oxford&#x27;s New Children&#x27;s Hospital, which was completed in 2008.

<doc id="948064" wikidata="Q17020645" url="?curid=948064" title="XFM Scotland (2006)">
<text>XFM Scotland was a regional radio station broadcasting to Scotland&#x27;s Central Belt, an area surrounding the two cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. The station changed format to join the Galaxy Network on 8 November 2008 as Galaxy Scotland.

==History==

It began on 19 November 1999 as Beat 106, a dance music station. The first presenter on-air, at 1:06 p.m. on launch day, was Matt Finlay, who stayed at the station until late 2005. After launch, Beat quickly widened its format to include rock and R&amp;B music. Beat 106 closed on 1 January 2006, playing a countdown of the top 1000 tracks voted for by visitors to its website, entitled &quot;&quot;The X-List&quot;.

Beat 106 was originally established by the Big Beat Group, headed up by a group of nightclub promoters from Glasgow. However, just a few months into its existence, in July 2000, it was bought by the Capital Radio Group. In 2005, Capital Radio merged with the GWR Group to form GCap Media, creating the UK&#x27;s largest commercial radio group. The rebranding of Beat 106 to XFM was one of a number of measures announced by GCap to improve their corporate performance following the merger. The original XFM station was Xfm London and the rebranding in Scotland occurred four months before the expected launch of Xfm Manchester.

Normal XFM Scotland programmes were launched by breakfast presenter Dominik Diamond on 4 January 2006. The first record to be played on XFM Scotland was &#x27;Loaded&#x27; by Primal Scream. (The first record to be played on Beat 106 was &quot;Revolution&quot;&quot; by The Beatles.)

On 11 February 2008 GCap Media announced that they would be selling the analogue licence for the station.

On 28 August 2008, Jim Gellatly announced that his last show would be broadcast that day and he would be leaving the station together with a number of colleagues.

== Re branding to Galaxy (Now known as Capital FM)==
On 27 August 2008 new owners Global Radio announced it would re-brand XFM Scotland as Galaxy Scotland. The re-brand was part of Global Radio&#x27;s major strategy to expand the brand across the UK. On 8 November 2008 Galaxy Scotland joined the Galaxy Network (Now known as the Capital FM Network) .

XFM Scotland&#x27;s last days on-air were broadcast during the weekend of 25–26 October 2008, with the website warning visitors and listeners that XFM would shortly be no longer available in the area on FM. It advised XFM fans to switch to DAB, the Internet stream or satellite to continue listening, and to visit http://www.xfm.co.uk (XFM London and XFM Manchester&#x27;s shared website) and not http://www.xfmscotland.co.uk from Monday 27 October.

== Relaunch of XFM Scotland ==
On 7 April 2014, Global Radio relaunched XFM Scotland on 96.3 FM from the Paisley area. XFM Scotland replaced Real Radio XS, Which used to broadcast on the same frequency. This lasted until September 2015, when Global announced that XFM (UK) would be rebranding as Radio X (United Kingdom). Due to the devolved nations rule, Radio X couldn&#x27;t be fully networked on 96.3FM. Global decided to hand the Scottish FM licence back prior to Radio X&#x27;s launch.

<doc id="948066" wikidata="Q5578576" url="?curid=948066" title="Gold (British radio network)">
<text>Gold Radio is a network of oldies radio stations in the United Kingdom, which was formed by the merger of the Capital Gold network and the Classic Gold network in August 2007. The station relaunched in March 2014 as a partly-automated service, broadcasting in fewer areas, after many of Gold&#x27;s local AM/DAB frequencies were transferred to Smooth Radio. Most programming is broadcast from the Global Radio studios in Leicester Square, London.

The station ceased broadcasting on AM in London on 29 September 2023 leaving Manchester as the only area receiving Gold on analogue radio. On 12 April 2024 the Gold website posted that the final AM transmitter would close at the end of the month.

As of September 2024, the network broadcasts to a combined weekly audience of 1.8 million, according to RAJAR.

==History==

The Capital Gold network started in London in 1988 on Capital Radio&#x27;s AM frequency, as the Government urged radio stations to end simulcasting (broadcasting the same programmes simultaneously on AM and FM) and threatened to remove one of their frequencies if simulcasting continued. The Classic Gold network was similarly formed from the AM transmissions of the former GWR Group&#x27;s station licence areas. (Many of the FM pop stations to which the Gold stations were sister operations are themselves now part of the Heart or Capital networks.)

The original presenters on the early incarnation of Capital Gold included Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett and David Hamilton. The hiring of radio personalities to host networked shows continued to be a feature of the Capital Gold and Classic Gold networks as they grew, though following the 2014 relaunch Gold only had three presenters.

Following the merger of Capital Radio plc and GWR Group plc to form GCap Media in 2005, a review of station assets was carried out by Chief Executive Ralph Bernard. One of the aims for 2006 was that Capital Gold would be carried on a national digital multiplex – enabling near-nationwide coverage – by the merger between itself and digital-only station &quot;Capital Life&quot;. However, following GCap&#x27;s purchase of the Classic Gold Digital Network in April 2007, the former plan was scrapped, and it was decided to merge the two networks to form the &quot;Gold Network&quot; (this began at 7p.m. on 3 August 2007). The majority of the shows and presenters on the new station were taken from Capital Gold&#x27;s former network, rather than Classic Gold&#x27;s network, with the exception of Erika North, who was the co-presenter on the Classic Gold breakfast show with radio DJ Tony Blackburn. She co-hosted the new &quot;Gold&quot; breakfast show with James Cannon until December 2010; with Blackburn having quit the network completely, joining Smooth Radio. Local programming took the form of a voice-tracked show on weekdays between noon and 4p.m.

On 28 June 2010, the local afternoon programming on Gold stations in England was dropped by Global Radio following changes in OFCOM regulation. This led to all stations receiving networked programme content from London, though split local advertising and news bulletins continued to be dropped into the networked output. The broadcaster continued to be required to deliver a four-hour local show for Wales, which was broadcast on both the South Wales (sister to Red Dragon/Capital) and North Wales &amp; Cheshire (ex-Marcher) Gold stations.

Gold is now owned by Global Radio. A condition of Global&#x27;s takeover was that the local stations in Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Worcester had to be sold and were operated under a franchise to Orion Media. Orion Media ended the franchise agreement and relaunched its Gold West Midlands stations as Free Radio 80s on 4 September 2012.

On 12 September 2024, the station was rebranded as Gold Radio with the new strapline &quot;All Time Classics&quot;. 

==Transfer of AM and DAB outlets to Smooth Radio==
On 28 February 2014, Global Radio announced that all but four AM transmitters and three DAB transmission areas would be transferred to broadcast their recently acquired Smooth Radio station with effect from Monday 24 March 2014. Only London, Nottingham, Derby and Manchester would continue to receive Gold on AM frequencies, and London &amp; Home Counties, Yorkshire, Leicester and Nottingham areas on DAB. These remained with Gold as Smooth Radio is broadcast on FM in London, the North West and the East Midlands, and the Yorkshire DAB broadcast was a relay of the London service. Global encouraged listeners not in these areas to move to Smooth Radio, or else continue to listen to Gold via satellite, cable, or internet streaming.

==Expansion of DAB outlets==
On 7 September 2015, Global Radio announced Gold would take over the local DAB multiplex slots previously occupied by XFM, following the latter&#x27;s rebrand as Radio X and its move to the Digital One national multiplex on 21 September 2015. The announcement said Gold would become available again on DAB in Manchester, Birmingham, Ayr, Bournemouth, Cambridge, Cornwall, Exeter/Torbay/North Devon, Kent, Norwich, Peterborough, Plymouth, Reading/Basingstoke, Southend/Chelmsford, on the Sussex Coast and in Swindon. This is in addition to Gold&#x27;s existing DAB availability in London, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Yorkshire.

On Monday 10 June 2019, Gold expanded to transmit nationally via the Digital One DAB+ multiplex; the station had been using DAB+ for its transmission in London since early 2019. The relaunch as a national service was accompanied by a new breakfast show hosted by DJ James Bassam, joining from sister station Capital.

In September 2019, many of the local-level DAB transmissions of Gold were transferred to a new service, Smooth Country. Gold continues to broadcast on DAB in the East Midlands, where Smooth Country took the place of Smooth Chill.

Following the relaunch of Connect FM as part of Smooth East Midlands on 1 October 2019, Gold programming returned to the AM and local DAB platforms in Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, reversing the change made to these frequencies in 2014.

==Closure of AM transmitters==
Recent years has seen Global withdraw from AM transmission and by 2023, Gold only remained on AM in Manchester and London. August 2023 saw Global announce that Gold would end its AM broadcasting in London and just before midnight on 29 September 2023 the final song played on Gold 1548 London was the song that had launched Capital Radio nearly half a century earlier - &#x27;Bridge over Troubled Water&#x27;. Programming then ceased, and a retuning announcement was played until closure of the transmitter just before 1100. The Gold London outlet continues on DAB. Gold on AM in Manchester ended at the end of April 2024.

<text>Olde English was an American sketch comedy troupe based in New York City. The group published over 100 comedy shorts on the internet, and performed live at several venues and festivals in the US.

==History==

Olde English was formed by a group of students at Bard College, and was originally conceived by Ben Popik. While traveling in Europe during the summer of 2002, Popik chose the name for the group and began writing some of the early sketches. In the fall of 2002, Popik returned to Bard and held auditions for the group. By 2010, Olde English consisted of Adam Conover, Ben Popik, Raphael Bob-Waksberg, Dave Segal, and Caleb Bark, although several others had joined and left over the years.

Olde English produced videos for its website since 2002, usually posting one sketch every two weeks. In 2004, Olde English released its first self-produced DVD, &quot;Gorilla Warfare&quot;.

The group gained increased popularity in 2003 when their video &quot;Gym Class&quot; became a viral hit. In 2006, the group released a video titled &quot;One Picture Every Day&quot;, starring Ben Popik and featuring an original song by former member Jesse Novak. The sketch is a parody of an internet phenomenon popularized by Noah Kalina and Jonathan Keller. The video was seen on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as well as a Mountain Dew ad campaign. On January 17, 2007, Olde English announced that its videos would be regularly featured on the comedy website Super Deluxe.

Olde English performed live at the Chicago Sketch Comedy Festival (2005), the San Francisco Sketchfest (2005–2007) and the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival (2007).

Olde English&#x27;s &quot;Free NYC Rap&quot;, a rap music video protesting the restrictions for independent New York City filmmakers that were proposed in Fall 2007, was nominated for a 2007 ECNY award.

== Other projects ==
The members of Olde English—along with former members Joel Clark and Jesse Novak, as well as longtime collaborator Chioke Nassor—completed their first feature film, &quot;The Exquisite Corpse Project&quot; in 2012. The film first premiered at festivals in June 2012, and became available for commercial download at the end of April 2013.

<doc id="948069" wikidata="Q1329577" url="?curid=948069" title="William Henry Ogilvie">
<text>William Henry Ogilvie (21 August 1869 – 30 January 1963) was a Scottish-Australian narrative poet and horseman, jackaroo, and drover, and described as a quiet-spoken handsome Scot of medium height, with a fair moustache and red complexion. He was also known as Will Ogilvie, by the pen names including &#x27;Glenrowan&#x27; and the lesser &#x27;Swingle-Bar&#x27;, and by his initials, WHO.

Ogilvie was part of the trio of Australian bush poets, with Banjo Paterson (1864–1941) and Henry Lawson (1867–1922). His &quot;Fair girls and gray horses&quot; (1896) was considered second only to Banjo Paterson&#x27;s &quot;Man from Snowy River&quot; (1895). A reader ballot in 1914 saw him placing seventh of Australia&#x27;s twelve most favourite poets.

Wearing the title of &#x27;Universally acclaimed in Australia as a bush balladist of the &quot;Outback&quot;&#x27;, Will H. Ogilvie wrote over 1,100 poems, including &quot;A Scotch night&quot;, &quot;The Australian&quot;, &quot;Summer country&quot;, &quot;Kings of the earth&quot;, and &quot;Whaup o&#x27; the rede&quot;.

==Personal life==

Ogilvie was born at Holefield, near Kelso, Borders, Scotland on 21 August 1869 to George Ogilvie and Agnes Christie, the second child of eight. George farmed the lands of the Earl of Dalkeith on the Buccleuch Estates. Agnes, an orphan of the Indian Mutiny at Cawnpore, was a gifted pianist. Of the eight children – Zoe (b. 1867), George (b. 1872), Winifred (b. 1873), Tom (b. 1875), Eric (b. 1876), Kate (b. 1879), and Gladys (b. 1884) – William was the only one to marry.

Ogilvie was educated at Kelso High School for two terms as a weekly boarder, had some tutoring in Yorkshire, before entering Fettes College, Edinburgh where he excelled as a runner and in rugby.

Having just turned twenty years of age, he travelled from Scotland to Australia on the &quot;SS Arcadia&quot; for four weeks, via the Suez Canal, arriving in Sydney on 1 November 1889. During his time in Australia he worked on sheep stations in north-western New South Wales, south-eastern South Australia, and central New South Wales, where he was a proficient horseman, and gained the reputation as one of Australia&#x27;s top bush poets.

After eleven years on the continent, on 9 February 1901 aged thirty-one, in Sydney the poet and bushman boarded the &quot;SS Persic&quot; travelling by way of Cape Town to Liverpool, England. Ogilvie returned to Scotland to Edinburgh to become a freelance journalist. From 1905 to 1908, he held the position of professor of agricultural journalism at the Iowa State College, United States of America. American ranch life however held no attraction to that of Australian properties.

In 1908 he returned again to Scotland and married Katharine Margaret &#x27;Madge&#x27; Scott Anderson (1879 – 25 June 1965), the daughter of Tom Scott Anderson and a descendant of Dr Alexander Anderson who participated in the last and fatal expedition of explorer Mungo Park. Will and Madge had two children, Margaret Deloraine &#x27;Wendy&#x27; Ogilvie (1909–2003), and George Thomas Anderson Ogilvie (1912–1995), when living at &#x27;Brundenlaws&#x27; in the village of Bowden.

Australia remained important to the poet, prizing a stockwhip made by Alexander Patton with a silver tacks spelling out &#x27;W.H.O.&#x27; on the handle, and making a damper for visiting guests. Australia also remembered Ogilvie through continued correspondence over his later years, including school children wishing him a happy 70th birthday.

During World War I, Ogilvie remained in Great Britain, and was in charge of and prepared Canadian horses for military service at the Army Remounts Branch in Wiltshire, England. Fellow Australian poet A. B. &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson was placed with the Australian Remount Service in 1915, rising to become its officer in charge in Cairo, Egypt.

In 1918 he first leased then bought the Presbyterian church manse &#x27;Kirklea&#x27; at Ashkirk, Selkirkshire, Scotland. At the start of World War II Ogilvie, aged 71, undertook ARP warden duties in Selkirk. He continued to live in Kirklea until his death at 93 years of age in 1963, followed by his wife Madge in 1965. His ashes were scattered on the hill road to Roberton, Scotland, along with Australian wattle leaves.

Ogilvie&#x27;s son George wrote the biography entitled &quot;Balladist of Borders &amp; Bush&quot; in 1994.

==Influences==

The poet actively acknowledged the influences of Australian poet Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833–1870):

:Our Lindsay Gordon! From the north-most cape 
:South to the Otway he is loved and known. 
:The boughs that shadow and the dusts that drape 
:His horse and horseman— are they not our own? 
:And every bronzed, burnt bushman in the east, 
:And every digger In the western mines, 
:From him has learned one lilting page at least, 
:And loved it for the heart between the lines.

He was given to be of the Whyte-Melville school, named after Scottish novelist and poet George John Whyte-Melville (1821–1878), which was evident in two poems of the same name in his works &quot;Galloping shoes&quot; (1922) and &quot;Scattered scarlet&quot; (1923).

Ogilvie wrote lyrical and romantic poetry noted for its balladic style, with expressive descriptions of Australian Outback life and characters. Will, as he was known, also wrote a great deal of work on English and Scottish themes and his work has been included in collections of English and Scottish poetry. All of his work was originally published in, and he is most closely associated with, Australia. Before being printed in books, many works in the newspapers were under the pen name of &#x27;Glenrowan&#x27;, and also &#x27;Swingle-Bar&#x27;. It was suggested &#x27;Glenrowan&#x27; was named for the town of Glenrowan, Victoria where he passed through on his way to Gunningbland station, near Parkes, New South Wales in 1894 as a roustabout. Ogilvie however had been using that pen name by April 1893. &#x27;Swinglebar&#x27; is the name associated with a wooden bar between draught horses and a wagon that keeps the chains separate. He also wrote in Australia under the names of &#x27;Free Lance&#x27; and &#x27;Fourth Mate&#x27;, and in Scotland with &#x27;Freebooter&#x27;.

Events in Eastern Australia also brought &#x27;the Lucky Country&#x27; an impact on the quality of life in the last decade of the 1800s:

* the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike (with issues still persisting into 1894, even on Belalie, a property where Ogilvie worked),
* the Australian banking crisis of 1893 (where bank notes from collapsed banks became worthless), and
* the Federation Drought (from 1896 to 1902). Due to the droughts, properties such as Belalie underwent destocking in 1899.

Ogilvie captured the essence of droughts in his words, contained within &quot;The outlaw&quot; (To round the cattle on drafting-camps on drought-bound western runs), &quot;The pack horse&quot; (But drought had stolen my strength away), &quot;The team bullock&quot; (Grim Drought had bound the Western land), and particularly &quot;Back o&#x27; Bourke&quot; (That&#x27;s where the fires of hell burn through).

At the time of 1898 each of Australia&#x27;s balladeers wrote of a different phase of their own lives: &#x27;Lawson the swagman, Dyson the miner, Daley the poet, Paterson the humorist... And now Ogilvie... the horseman&#x27;. In the same year, it was also suggested that Daley was &#x27;Ogilvie&#x27;s only living rival&#x27;, but does not explain the absence of references to Lawson and Paterson.

His good friend Harry &#x27;Breaker&#x27; Morant was said to write like Ogilvie, beginning &#x27;to write prose and verse – mostly horse-verse and lovey-dovey rhymes&#x27;. Similarly some outside influences can be seen in some of Ogilvie&#x27;s work: that of John Greenleaf Whittier in &quot;Memory town&quot;, Rudyard Kipling in &quot;Black sheep&quot;, and perhaps a little of Henry Lawson. Robert Burns, Robert Browning, James Hogg, and John Keats have all been ascribed. Within the poet&#x27;s own &quot;A song of the poets&quot;, he also hints at Robert Bridges, Abercrombie, Davies, W. B. Yeats, Noyes, Watson, Henry Newbolt and John Masefield.

His love of the Australian Outback, dogs, and horses is well-reflected in his work (&quot;My Life in the Open&quot;, &quot;Kelpies&quot;, &quot;The Australian&quot;). The equestrian dedication was even subject of jibes:

:For suffering days, weeks, and months, we&#x27;ve heard Adam Lindsay Gordon. &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson, Will Ogilvie, Harry Morant and others spoken, mouthed, recited, garroted and assassinated in the pursuit of verses dedicated to Horse!&#x27;

A collection of Will Ogilvie&#x27;s poetry was published in &quot;Saddle for a throne&quot; (1952), &#x27;Dedicated to comrades of camp-fire and muster&#x27;; the book contains a foreword by R. M. Williams, who met him in the late 1940s and who was instrumental in publishing the works. Cited as a &#x27;triumvirate of renown – the horsemen poets&#x27;, he held the pedestal with Adam Lindsay Gordon and R. B. Cunninghame Graham.

Ogilvie also wrote tributes about soldiers, including &quot; &#x27;The Australian: The bravest thing God ever made!&#x27; (A British officer&#x27;s opinion)&quot; which was set to music by 1918. During World War I, Ogilvie contributed verses for the London &quot;Punch&quot; magazine. In World War II, his poem &quot;The Australian&quot; was reprinted, the only article ever republished by the magazine (by 1970).

Women or &#x27;fair girls&#x27; were also a recurring theme in Ogilvie&#x27;s poems, including &quot;His Gippsland girl&quot;. Although his attitudes were said to be that of a courtly gentleman, and mindful of his love of horses, &#x27;One might say that he showed no sign of deeper feeling for girls than for horses.&#x27;

Ogilvie was included as one of the worthy &#x27;sun-browned muses&#x27; who wrote in rhythmic metre rather than &#x27;free style&#x27; evident by the 1920s:

:I claim that my old friends the Bush poets are the sort that the Empire needs – workers, sportsmen, fighters, good comrades—and as to the pale, long-haired writer of free verse, let us take him out and drown him!

He exercised his prerogative to both use the same title for different poems, and adjust existing poems.

* &quot;Adam Lindsay Gordon&quot; (poem) 
** &#x27;Ah! sad, proud Gordon! Crossing swords with Care, And touching hands so many times with Death&#x27; (&quot;Hearts of gold&quot;, 1903). 
** &#x27;Our Lindsay Gordon! From the north-most cape, South to the Otway he is loved and known.&#x27; (1919 newspaper) 
** &#x27;Two things stand like stone,&#x27; he said— &#x27;Courage and Kindness. Gallant Dead!&#x27; (&quot;Galloping shoes&quot;, 1922)
* &quot;Australia&quot; (poem) 
** &#x27;I have gathered verse-gold from her glory, Spell-bound in her emerald chains; I have stolen her heart for a story&#x27; (1899 newspaper) 
** &#x27;She has hidden each footprint of mine&#x27; (&quot;The collected sporting verse of Will H. Ogilvie&quot;, 1932) 
** &#x27;Arrayed against the Triple Powers&#x27; (&quot;From sunset to dawn&quot;, 1946)

He occasionally assigned another title to an existing poem, such as &quot;The ploughman&quot; (in &quot;Hearts of gold&quot; (1903)) and &quot;The ploughman poet&quot; (1925, in an Australian newspaper).

By 1950 the poet was still warmly described as &#x27;one of Australia&#x27;s greatest and most loved poets&#x27;, and &#x27;one of the last of the great poets of the 1900 era&#x27;.

Ogilvie&#x27;s work also went on to influence others, including &#x27;a lifetime addiction&#x27; of his accounts by Australian architect Mary Turner Shaw (1906–1990), including his insights into stock movements in the Outback. Australian artist Hugh Sawrey (1919–1999) was also inspired by Paterson and Ogilvie, especially the affinity to horses and experiencing the droving life.

==Australian period==

After schooling, Ogilvie was sent to Australia in 1889 as a &#x27;testing ground&#x27; by his father, returning to Scotland after a decade. He had a deep love of horses and riding and he became interested in the Outback. Setting out from Sydney in November 1890, before long he became an expert station hand, drover and horse breaker. Over his eleven years Ogilvie worked on several pastoral stations including:

* &#x27;Belalie&#x27;, north of the town of Enngonia on the Warrego River, north-west New South Wales, south of Barringun (from 1891, for 2.5 years);
* &#x27;Maaoupe&#x27;, north-west of Penola in south-east South Australia, as an overseer (1893);
* &#x27;Gunningbland&#x27;, near Parkes, New South Wales (1894);
* &#x27;Nelungaloo&#x27;, near Parkes, New South Wales;
* &#x27;Genangie&#x27;, at Peak Hill, Parkes/Forbes district of New South Wales; and
* &#x27;Brindinyabba&#x27;, near his first station of Belalie, between Enngonia, New South Wales, and Hungerford, Queensland (1900).

It was a letter of introduction to Robert Scott&#x27;s family that directed him to Belalie, to help friends of the family. It was here he received the inspiration to pen &quot;Fair girls and gray horses&quot;, based on Robert Scott&#x27;s daughter Lynette, and a grey horse &#x27;Loyal Heart&#x27; he bought from the local pound. The acclaimed poem was first penned on the stock route between Forbes and Bogan Gate in the NSW Parkes area before being refined on the walls of his bedroom at Maaoupe station. Separately later on it was identified the horse had been stolen from Australian outback pioneer Patsy Durack (1834–1898).

Nostalgically Ogilvie wrote &quot;Back to the border&quot; of his time at Belalie station:

:But sling me a saddle on some good horse 
:Bred on Belalie or Lila Springs, 
:With the Warrego mud in his mane, of course, 
:And the grass-feed green on his snaffle rings. 
:Over Bourke bridge at the break of day 
:Let me north where the red tracks run, 
:And blindfold yet I could find my way 
:Through Enngonia to Barringun.

The thoughts were repeated in &quot;Comrades&quot; and &quot;After the horses&quot;, referring to Belalie&#x27;s &quot;R-S-bar&quot; cattle brand.

After Belalie, Ogilvie travelled overland to Maaoupe station in South Australia prior to November 1893 and probably earlier as an overseer, which was owned by the family of Dr James Dickson and managed by Mr John McCouchie, one of them a cousin of William Scott. Many poems were submitted under the pen name &#x27;Glenrowan&#x27; to the South Australian &quot;The Border Watch&quot; newspaper, including &quot;A draft from Tringadee&quot;, &quot;The dapple greys&quot;, &quot;Dark lamps&quot;, &quot;The filling of the swamps&quot;, &quot;How the chestnut horse came home&quot;, &quot;Kings of the earth&quot;, and &quot;Unsung heroes&quot;. After a period, it is reported that Ogilvie rode overland back to the Bourke area, and then onto the Forbes area of the Colony of New South Wales as &#x27;drover, horse-breaker, rouseabout, and gentleman at large&#x27;.

In 1894, Ogilvie was employed as a roustabout at Gunningbland station, near Parkes, New South Wales. Later on he travelled to Nelungaloo station (owned by the Reg Lackey family), and Genangie station at Peak Hill, also near Parkes, New South Wales. It was at Nelungaloo he met and became the friend of Harry &#x27;Breaker&#x27; Morant, even writing &quot;Ode to &#x27;The Breaker&#x27; in bandages&quot; following a horse-riding accident. This period also saw Morant and Ogilvie become good friends all-round with &quot;Western Champion&quot; newspaper editor Gordon Tidy. With Morant&#x27;s death by firing squad during the Second Boer War in South Africa in 1902, Ogilvie penned &quot;Harry Morant&quot;:

:Harry Morant was a friend I had 
::In the years long passed away, 
:A chivalrous, wild and reckless lad, 
::A knight born out of his day, 
:He loved a girl, and he loved a horse, 
::And he never let down a friend, 
:And reckless he was, but he rode his course 
::With courage up to the end, 
:&quot;Breaker Morant&quot; was the name he earned, 
::For no bucking horse could throw 
:This Englishman who had lived and learned 
::As much as the bushmen know. 
:&quot;The Breaker&quot; is sleeping in some far place 
::Where the Boer War heroes lie, 
:And we&#x27;ll meet no more in a steeplechase– 
::Harry Morant and I.

Ogilvie&#x27;s other poems about &#x27;The Breaker&#x27; included &quot;When The Breaker is booked for the south&quot;, &quot;H. Morant &#x27;Breaker&#x27; leaves with S.A. Contingent&quot;, &quot; &#x27;Glenrowan&#x27; to &#x27;The Breaker&#x27; &quot;, and &quot;To the memory of Harry Morant&quot; (circa 1902). Tidy wrote Morant&#x27;s obituary. Ogilvie and Tidy maintained a strong friendship during their lives.

The poem &quot;For the honor of Old England and the glory of the game&quot; (1897) of an actual polo competition in the Parkes, New South Wales area, involving Morant and Ogilvie was not the same as Banjo Paterson&#x27;s &quot;The Geebung Polo Club&quot; which was written four years earlier although surmised by some later writers.

It appears one of Ogilvie&#x27;s last Australian stations was Brindinyabba, New South Wales, near his first station of Belalie, between Enngonia and Hungerford, Queensland. His understanding of conservation was demonstrated circa 1900 when he berated another labourer for clearing mulga trees by saying &#x27;Still killing Australia?&#x27;. Ogilvie pointed out the value of the plant, this at a time of the Federation Drought.

One poem about New South Wales bushranger Ben Hall (1837–1865), &quot;The death of Ben Hall&quot;, has been suggested to be written not by Ogilvie. The history of Hall was certainly known to Ogilvie, the poem was published under Ogilvie&#x27;s name, as well as him penning another poem, &quot;Ben Hall&#x27;s stirrup irons&quot;.

Collected from Australian newspapers of the preceding five years, a selection of poems within the book entitled &quot;Fair girls and gray horses&quot; was published by &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in November 1898 and was well received as &#x27;the most charming book of Australian verse that has yet appeared&#x27;. The book was reprinted four times by 1901 due to demand. Subsequent editions contained varying numbers of poems, and in different orders (for example the 1905 edition at fourteen thousand impressions had 95 poems and a photograph of a young Will sitting with his arms crossed, while the 1930 edition of nineteen thousand impressions had 84 poems and a photograph of Will standing beside his dog).

Scottish-Australian book sellers, Angus &amp; Robertson commenced operation in 1886 in Sydney. This Scottish background influenced the books offered for sale, together with the Robertson&#x27;s experiences of hardship and humanity led to supporting writers, and manuscripts of bush life. Bush ballads particularly were understood by the Australian public. Kipling also encouraged the company to foster Australian poetry through ballads too, the words becoming part of the cultural identity. With this foundation, Ogilvie became an Angus &amp; Robertson author.

Ogilvie was castigated for embellishing the mythology of the Australian outback and life:

:In his later days, Will. Ogilvie has been responsible for some very exquisite verse. His early efforts were too effusive in their praise of our bush and its beauty, and this fact does not please many. That we can let pass, because he was fascinated by the country and bush life as he found it in the New South Wales and Queensland life he lived; so much so that he has not always exercised due restraint in his poetic outbursts. To those who claim to know this verse of Henry Lawson comes as the voice of truth, sure and firm after the Scotchman&#x27;s fine prettiness: I think Ogilvie&#x27;s mistake was that he emphasised the charm of the bush in place of the lure. The bush is a fierce, hungry mistress, who is too passionate in her moods for the word &quot;charm&quot; to be anything but a misplaced one. Nevertheless, W. H. Ogilvie is enchanting at his best moments. His ringing verse at times reminds us of the ringing echos of the galloping hoofs of the horses this man knew and loved so well.

It was accepted he wrote about the Australian bush with romanticism.

:The camp fire gleams resistance
::To every twinkling star;
:The horse bells in the dlstance
::Are jangling faint and far:
:Through gum boughs lorn and lonely
::The passing breezes sigh;
:In all the world are only
::My star-crowned love and I.

The poem &quot;A Scotch night&quot; (also known as &quot;The wee Scotch night&quot; and &quot;A braw Scotch nicht&quot;) is well-associated with Ogilvie, first published under his own name in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in Australia. There was an attempt by one person to &#x27;pirate it in Scotland, but Mr. Ogilvie promptly exposed the dishonest trick&#x27;. Despite all this, the poem was the one for which he sought not to be remembered. Thinking it more suited to the traditional music halls, Will H. Ogilvie desired something more serious.

Some of his work included songs which were set to music, such as &quot;Bells along Macquarie&quot; in the 1901 &quot;Commonwealth Annual&quot;, and &quot;The barefoot maid&quot; with music by Donald Crichton. May 1900 saw a ten guinea competition prize awarded to Sydney composer George Ernest Vincent (–1932) for the best musical setting for &quot;Hearts of gold&quot;.

It was unknown if the phrase &#x27;back of Bourke&#x27; was in common use at the time or popularised by Ogilvie in his poem &quot;At the back o&#x27; Bourke&quot;.

By late January 1901, on his imminent return to Scotland after eleven years, he had progressed from being labelled as coming to the colonies for experience, to one of the colonists (&#x27;though only a ten-year colonist&#x27;), to being identified as an Australian (&#x27;Poet Will Ogilvie goes to Scotland after a sojourn of several years in the Australian bush. Australian poets appear to have excellent luck nowadays.&#x27;). His farewell bohemian banquet at the Hotel Australia, Sydney, was hosted by also-notable poets Louise Mack and Victor Daley, and included the participation of colleagues Banjo Paterson and Roderic Quinn.

==Scottish period==

After returning from Australia in 1901 aboard the SS &quot;Persic&quot;, and again in 1908 after two years away in the United States of America, Ogilvie settled into the role of &#x27;Border poet&#x27; based in the south near the Scottish–English border. &quot;Whaup o&#x27; the rede&quot; was composed in 1908, and was a long poem said to be in the way of Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832). With his unshakeable love for the area, already declared in &quot;Bowmont Water, far away&quot; written while he was in Australia, in 1909 came &quot;The land we love&quot;:

:When all sounds else are silent. 
::when all songs else depart, 
:The brown burns of the Border 
::Shall sing within my heart.

Now with children, Ogilvie penned some graceful lullabies and children&#x27;s songs. The daily routine after breakfast and reading prayers was to sit down with a pencil and notepad, and started with a couplet from a recent thought. Poems were not typed but done by hand, as was also his late-1890s practice, &#x27;A memory of him clings locally as a good-natured, easy going bushman, who sauntered leisurely into the newspaper office, presented a crumpled and often soiled manuscript, and, after inviting the staff to have a drink, would turn his gray once more to Gunningbland&#x27;. His interest in horses continued with &quot;Galloping shoes&quot;, &quot;Over the grass&quot; and &quot;Handful of leather&quot;.

Several of his poems were set to be sung, including &quot;Ettrick&quot; that is performed regularly at the Selkirk common riding. Ogilvie was one of the Selkirk Pageant committee members in 1935, where he wrote the prologue and epilogue.
Rural life was captured in many of his Border poems. Opinion articles were sent to Australia including about sheep and sheep dog. Ogilvie showed he more than just a poet but an astute observer and technical knowledge in these areas, reflected in the poem &quot;To a champion dead&quot; about &#x27;Old Kep&#x27;, a world-famous champion Scotch collie. He corresponded with renown Australian kelpie authority Tony Parsons on the breed. Later photographs of Will usually featured one of his dogs.

By 1961, some sixteen volumes of verse, two large collected editions, and numerous magazine and other contributions had been published. Since his death, more of his poems are being re-discovered in old newspaper archives, and in past correspondence with acquaintances.

Ogilvie&#x27;s most commonly recited poems are &quot;A Scotch night&quot;, &quot;Bowmont Water&quot;, &quot;Ho for the blades of Harden&quot;, &quot;The barefoot maid&quot;, &quot;The comfort of the Hills&quot;, &quot;The land we love&quot;, &quot;The Raiders&quot;, and &quot;The road to Roberton&quot;.

==Similar names==

During Will H. Ogilvie&#x27;s life, there was also an unrelated but similarly named poet, Edinburgh architect and illustrator William Ogilvie (1891–1939). The latter poet published &quot;The witch and other verses&quot; (1923; 8 pages) and &quot;My mither&#x27;s aunt and other verses&quot; (1926; 8 pages), by Porpoise Press, Edinburgh.

Will H. Ogilvie should also not be confused with an Australian soldier, Trooper William Hedley Blair Ogilvie, who was also erroneously listed as William Henry Ogilvie, as probably a clerical error due to a name association. Trooper Ogilvie (13 April 1880 – 12 December 1901), of Parkside, South Australia, one of the six children of Walter Ogilvie and Annie Passfield (1846–), joined the Fourth Imperial Bushmen Contingent, and died from fever during the Second Boer War.

==Legacy==

&#x27;Poets Trek&#x27;, part of the Festival of a Thousand Stories, is held annually in September for over twenty years, in Bourke, New South Wales as a two-day literary tour. Led by a group of local poets and enthusiasts, the trek goes through some of the mulga plains and paddocks trod by Lawson, Morant, Ogilvie, and Paterson.

Several poems were set to music during Ogilvie&#x27;s lifetime, including by famed English composer Graham Peel with 1920 &#x27;The challenge&#x27;. Slim Dusty&#x27;s 1980 &quot;The man who steadies the lead&quot; song compilation acknowledged two of Will&#x27;s works – the self-titled album and &quot;The pearl of them all&quot;. Ogilvie&#x27;s verse was also put to music by bush poet Gary Fogarty, of Millmerran, Queensland, with thirteen poems on &quot;The Tartan Saddlecloth&quot; in 2005. Scotland&#x27;s Hawick-based &#x27;folk-and-roll&#x27; band Scocha set several of Will&#x27;s poems to music, and continued by the restructured and renamed group as &#x27;Harden Blades&#x27;.

In 1959, Hazel de Berg, who interviewed many people within Australia including author May Gibbs and journalist Kenneth Cook, audio-recorded Ogilvie reciting sixteen of his poems. Poems included &#x27;The bushmen&#x27;, &#x27;From the Gulf&#x27;, &#x27;The men who blazed the track&#x27;, &#x27;Opals&#x27;, &#x27;A leaf from Macquarie&#x27;, and &#x27;Kelpies&#x27;. The preserved recording is held by the National Library of Australia.

A portrait of Will is in the collection (#1646) of the Toowoomba Regional Art Gallery, Toowoomba, Queensland. The oil-on-canvas portrait measuring 46 cm high and 35.5 cm wide by Mary Lindsay-Oliver was donated to Bolton by Madge Ogilvie following the death of her husband in July 1963. The associated Bolton Reading Room in the Lionel Lindsay Gallery and Library also holds several of Ogilvie&#x27;s publications. Transport operator and philanthropist Bill Bolton MBE (1905–1973), an admirer of Australian pioneer values, and who had corresponded with Ogilvie over time, established the gallery and library in 1959.

The nearby Cobb &amp; Co Museum, featuring all of Bolton&#x27;s horse-drawn wagons and stage coaches, also have Ogilvie&#x27;s treasured stockwhip and other items.

A memorial committee was set up Scotland in 1991 to raise funds to promote the name of Ogilvie and his works. The Will H. Ogilvie Memorial Trust had a large programme of events planned for 2019 with the 150th birthday of the poet.

On Saturday 20 July 2019 the &#x27;Will H. Ogilvie Way&#x27; was opened at the start of the B6352 road south of Kelso, Scottish Borders. The road leads to Holefield Farm, Ogilvie&#x27;s birthplace.

More material on Ogilvie&#x27;s life and contributions are also contained within the:

* Geoffrey Cains Collection of Australian manuscripts (MS 15500), State Library of Victoria, Melbourne. After fifty years of significant private collecting, it was acquired in 2014 by the library; and
* John Meredith Papers, National Library of Australia, Canberra. Meredith (1920–2001) wrote the book &quot;Breaker&#x27;s mate: Will Ogilvie in Australia&quot; (1996) exploring, critiquing and providing an interpretation of Ogilvie&#x27;s work. This also includes the unpublished manuscript &#x27;Scottish jackaroo&#x27;.

===Cairns===

A cairn to the poet was erected in 1993 between the villages of Ashkirk and Roberton in Scotland (GPS ), and there are also memorials to him in Australia. Upon the cairn of reclaimed stone was a bronze sculpture of an open book by Hawick sculptor Bill Landles. Unveiled in August 1993, the bronze was prised from the surface and stolen in August 2016 and still unrecovered by July 2017, feared stolen for scrap metal. The original mould was not retained but a three-dimensional image scan was obtained from the identical cairn in Australia allowing the replacement of a smaller bronze, unveiled on 17 August 2019, albeit in the new setting of Harden (GPS ). Other cairns are:

* Bourke, New South Wales, given to be an exact Landles bronze replica of the Roberton cairn. Located at Poets&#x27; Corner, Central Park, Mitchell Street (the Mitchell Highway) (GPS ); 
* Kelso, Scottish Borders, where the Will H. Ogilvie Stone is opposite Holefield Farm at Lempitlaw, on Friday 19 July 2019;
* Longreach, Queensland, at the Australian Stockman&#x27;s Hall of Fame; and
* Penola, South Australia, a National Trust roadside cairn adjacent to the old shearers quarters at the former Maaoupe station, unveiled on 8 June 1995. This was on the leftside of Maaoupe Road near the Glenroy-Maaoupe Road intersection, 13.8 km from Penola. At a later date the cairn was moved to the other side of the road beside the CFA shed for visitor safety (GPS ). 


A bust of Ogilvie by sculptor Judith Rolevink was unveiled on Sunday 2 December 2018, forming part of Poet&#x27;s Corner in Penola, South Australia, together with Shaw Neilson. Ogilvie is beside his inspirator, Adam Lindsay Gordon. Penola also has a footpath plaque to Ogilvie.

<doc id="948073" wikidata="Q6039388" url="?curid=948073" title="Nefiracetam">
<text>Nefiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family. Preliminary research suggests that it may possess certain antidementia properties in rats.

==Effects==
Nefiracetam&#x27;s cytoprotective actions are mediated by enhancement of GABAergic, cholinergic, and monoaminergic neuronal systems. Preliminary studies suggest that it improves apathy and motivation in post-stroke patients. It may also exhibit antiamnesia effects for the Alzheimer&#x27;s type and cerebrovascular type of dementia. In addition, research in animal models suggests antiamnesic effects against a number of memory impairing substances, including: ethanol, chlorodiazepoxide, scopolamine, bicuculline, picrotoxin, and cycloheximide.

==Pharmacology==
Unlike other racetams, nefiracetam shows high affinity for the GABAA receptor (IC50) = 8.5 nM), where it is presumed to be an agonist. It was able to potently inhibit 80% of muscimol binding to the GABAA receptor, although it failed to displace the remaining 20% of specific muscimol binding. Nefiracetam is able to reverse the amnesia caused by the GABAA receptor antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline in mice, although it failed to prevent seizures induced by these drugs.

==Concerns==
Studies of long-term consumption of nefiracetam in humans and primates have shown it to have no toxicity. However, animals which metabolize nefiracetam differently from humans and primates are at risk for renal and testicular toxicity. Dogs especially are particularly sensitive, which has been shown to be caused by a specific metabolite, M-18 which isn&#x27;t formed in humans. Higher doses than those in dogs were needed to cause testicular toxicity in rats, although no toxicity was seen in monkeys. Additionally, there has been no evidence of toxicity during clinical trials.

<doc id="948076" wikidata="Q1304433" url="?curid=948076" title="John Franklin Miller (California politician)">
<text>John Franklin Miller (November 21, 1831 – March 8, 1886) was a lawyer, businessman, and general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He represented California in the United States Senate from 1881 until his death. He was a proponent of several bills against Chinese immigrants.

==Early life and career==
Miller was born in South Bend, Indiana, to William Miller. His nephew, also named John Franklin Miller, was later a congressman from Washington. Both sometimes went by John F. Miller. Miller was educated in South Bend, Chicago, and in Ballston Spa, New York, where he received a law degree in 1852 from the New York State and National Law School. He was admitted to the bar and established a law practice in South Bend, but moved the next year to Napa, California. There, he continued his career as a lawyer, as well as becoming the county treasurer. He returned to South Bend in 1855 and resumed his practice. Miller was elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1860.

==Civil War==

With the secession of eleven Southern states and the outbreak of the Civil War, Miller joined the Union Army. On August 27, 1861, Governor Oliver P. Morton commissioned Miller as Colonel of the 29th Indiana Infantry. After training, the regiment was assigned to Kirk&#x27;s Brigade in Alexander M. McCook&#x27;s division in Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio and marched to Tennessee. Miller saw action on the second day of the Battle of Shiloh, as well as during the subsequent Siege of Corinth. Miller led his regiment through northern Alabama and Tennessee and pursued Braxton Bragg through Kentucky. Miller commanded a brigade under James Negley during the Battle of Stones River in late December 1862. On the second day of the battle, Miller spearheaded the Federal counterattack across Stones River which repulsed John C. Breckinridge&#x27;s Confederate attack. During this charge Miller was wounded in the neck.

During the Tullahoma Campaign, Miller commanded a brigade under General McCook in the XX Corps. He was severely wounded, losing his left eye, in a minor fight at Liberty Gap on June 27, 1863, and was out of action for nearly a year while he recuperated. Miller was promoted to brigadier general April 10, 1864, retroactive to January 5. In May 1864, he was assigned to administrative duty as commander of the garrison at Nashville, Tennessee. He returned to the field in December, commanding a sizable force of infantry and artillery at the Battle of Nashville. For his services at that battle, Miller was brevetted as a major general on March 13, 1865.

==Return to California==
Miller declined a commission as a colonel in the Regular Army and resigned from the Volunteers on September 29, 1865, to move back to California when President Andrew Johnson appointed him as collector of customs of the Port of San Francisco, a post he held until 1869 when he declined another term. He turned to business interests, and served for 12 years as the President of the Alaska Commercial Company, which controlled the fur industry in newly acquired Pribilof Islands.

Miller purchased the property which was part of Rancho Yajome in Napa Valley in the year 1869. At the time Miller bought this holding, it was entirely wilderness area. General and Mrs. Miller purchased the property in several parcels from different grantors, including the United States via a deed signed by President U.S. Grant and the State of California by a deed signed by Governor Newton Booth. Deeds conveying the various parcels to the General were dated in the years 1869, 1872, 1873 and 1881. Silverado Country Club now occupies the property.

Miller returned to politics, from 1878–79 as a member of the second state constitutional convention. The California state legislature elected the Republican Miller as one of the state&#x27;s two Senators in 1881. He was an outspoken proponent of several bills to limit the influx and influence of Chinese immigrants. 
He expressed his sentiments during passage of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act:

He was chairman, Committee to Revise the Laws of the United States (Forty-seventh Congress) and served on the Committee on Foreign Relations (Forty-ninth Congress).

Senator Miller died in Washington, D.C., while in office. He was initially buried in the Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco, but was reinterred in the Arlington National Cemetery on May 5, 1913, alongside his wife Mary Wickerham (Chess) Miller, his daughter, and his son-in-law, Rear Admiral Richardson Clover.

<text>Rolziracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family.

Rolziracetam was found to improve performance on a delayed-response task in aged rhesus monkeys. It has a wide margin of safety in animals and has been evaluated for use in cognitively impaired human subjects.
==Synthesis==
The nitro group of dimethyl 4-nitropimelate (1) is reduced by palladium-catalysed hydrogenation to an amino group, which cyclises to give a mixture of the lactam ester (2) and its corresponding acid (3). The mixture is hydrolysed using sodium hydroxide to convert all of the ester to the acid, and this material is cyclised to give rolziracetam using acetic anhydride.

<text>The Secret Doctrine, the Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy, is a pseudoscientific esoteric book as two volumes in 1888 written by Helena Blavatsky. The first volume is named &quot;Cosmogenesis&quot;, the second &quot;Anthropogenesis&quot;. It was an influential example of the revival of interest in esoteric and occult ideas in the modern age, in particular because of its claim to reconcile ancient eastern wisdom with modern science. Proponents widely claim the literature contains clues as to how the nature of prayer was &#x27;covered&#x27; and expunged from common wisdom, except for those with a keen eye.

The book has been criticized for promoting pseudoscientific concepts and for borrowing those from other systems.

== Volume one (Cosmogenesis) ==
In Volume One, Blavatsky details her interpretation of the origin and evolution of the universe itself, in terms derived from the Hindu concept of cyclical development. The world and everything in it is said to alternate between periods of activity (manvantaras) and periods of passivity (pralayas). Each manvantara lasts many millions of years and consists of a number of Yugas, in accordance with Hindu cosmology.

Blavatsky attempted to demonstrate that the discoveries of &quot;materialist&quot; science had been anticipated in the writings of ancient sages and that materialism would be proven wrong.

===Cosmic evolution: Items of cosmogony===
In this recapitulation of &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, Blavatsky gave a summary of the central points of her system of cosmogony. These central points are as follows:
# The first item reiterates Blavatsky&#x27;s position that &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; represents the &quot;accumulated Wisdom of the Ages&quot;, a system of thought that &quot;is the uninterrupted record covering thousands of generations of Seers whose respective experiences were made to test and to verify the traditions passed orally by one early race to another, of the teachings of higher and exalted beings, who watched over the childhood of Humanity.&quot;
# The second item reiterates the first fundamental proposition (see above), calling the one principle &quot;the fundamental law in that system [of cosmogony]&quot;. Here Blavatsky says of this principle that it is &quot;the One homogeneous divine Substance-Principle, the one radical cause. … It is called &quot;Substance-Principle,&quot; for it becomes &quot;substance&quot; on the plane of the manifested Universe, an illusion, while it remains a &quot;principle&quot; in the beginningless and endless abstract, visible and invisible Space. It is the omnipresent Reality: impersonal, because it contains all and everything. Its impersonality is the fundamental conception of the System. It is latent in every atom in the Universe, and is the Universe itself.&quot;
# The third item reiterates the second fundamental proposition (see above), impressing once again that &quot;The Universe is the periodical manifestation of this unknown Absolute Essence.&quot;, while also touching upon the complex Sanskrit ideas of Parabrahmam and Mulaprakriti. This item presents the idea that the One unconditioned and absolute principle is covered over by its veil, Mulaprakriti, that the spiritual essence is forever covered by the material essence.
# The fourth item is the common eastern idea of Maya. Blavatsky states that the entire universe is called illusion because everything in it is temporary, i.e. has a beginning and an end, and is therefore unreal in comparison to the eternal changelessness of the One Principle.
# The fifth item reiterates the third fundamental proposition (see above), stating that everything in the universe is conscious, in its own way and on its own plane of perception. Because of this, the Occult Philosophy states that there are no unconscious or blind laws of Nature, that all is governed by consciousness and consciousnesses.
# The sixth item gives a core idea of theosophical philosophy, that &quot;as above, so below&quot;. This is known as the &quot;law of correspondences&quot;, its basic premise being that everything in the universe is worked and manifested from within outwards, or from the higher to the lower, and that thus the lower, the microcosm, is the copy of the higher, the macrocosm. Just as a human being experiences every action as preceded by an internal impulse of thought, emotion or will, so too the manifested universe is preceded by impulses from divine thought, feeling and will. This item gives rise to the notion of an &quot;almost endless series of hierarchies of sentient beings&quot;, which itself becomes a central idea of many theosophists. The law of correspondences also becomes central to the methodology of many theosophists, as they look for analogous correspondence between various aspects of reality, for instance: the correspondence between the seasons of Earth and the process of a single human life, through birth, growth, adulthood and then decline and death.

== Volume two (Anthropogenesis) ==
The second half of the book describes the origins of humanity through an account of &quot;Root Races&quot; said to date back millions of years. The first root race was, according to her, &quot;ethereal&quot;; the second root had more physical bodies and lived in Hyperborea. The third root race, the first to be truly human, is said to have existed on the lost continent of Lemuria and the fourth root race is said to have developed in Atlantis.

According to Blavatsky, the fifth root race is approximately one million years old, overlapping the fourth root race and the very first beginnings of the fifth root race were approximately in the middle of the fourth root race.

&quot;The real line of evolution differs from the Darwinian, and the two systems are irreconcilable,&quot; according to Blavatsky, &quot;except when the latter is divorced from the dogma of &#x27;Natural Selection&#x27;.&quot; She explained that, &quot;by &#x27;Man&#x27; the divine Monad is meant, and not the thinking Entity, much less his physical body.&quot; &quot;Occultism rejects the idea that Nature developed man from the ape, or even from an ancestor common to both, but traces, on the contrary, some of the most anthropoid species to the Third Race man.&quot; In other words, &quot;the &#x27;ancestor&#x27; of the present anthropoid animal, the ape, is the direct production of the yet mindless Man, who desecrated his human dignity by putting himself physically on the level of an animal.&quot;

== Volumes three and four ==
Blavatsky wanted to publish a third and fourth volume of &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;. After Blavatsky&#x27;s death, a controversial third volume of &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; was prepared from Blavatsky&#x27;s papers and published by Annie Besant in 1897. The fourth volume is simply an index of the first three volumes, also prepared by Annie Besant.

==Three fundamental propositions==
Blavatsky explained the essential component ideas of her cosmogony in her magnum opus, &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;. She began with three fundamental propositions, of which she said:
The first proposition is that there is one underlying, unconditioned, indivisible Truth, variously called &quot;the Absolute&quot;, &quot;the Unknown Root&quot;, &quot;the One Reality&quot;, etc. It is causeless and timeless, and therefore unknowable and non-describable: &quot;It is &#x27;Be-ness&#x27; rather than Being&quot;. However, transient states of matter and consciousness are manifested in IT, in an unfolding gradation from the subtlest to the densest, the final of which is physical plane. According to this view, manifest existence is a &quot;change of condition&quot; and therefore neither the result of creation nor a random event.

Everything in the universe is informed by the potentialities present in the &quot;Unknown Root,&quot; and manifest with different degrees of Life (or energy), Consciousness, and Matter.

The second proposition is &quot;the absolute universality of that law of periodicity, of flux and reflux, ebb and flow&quot;. Accordingly, manifest existence is an eternally re-occurring event on a &quot;boundless plane&quot;: the playground of numberless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappearing, each one &quot;standing in the relation of an effect as regards its predecessor, and being a cause as regards its successor&quot;, doing so over vast but finite periods of time.

Related to the above is the third proposition: &quot;The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over-Soul... and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul—a spark of the former—through the Cycle of Incarnation (or &#x27;Necessity&#x27;) in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic law, during the whole term.&quot;
The individual souls are seen as units of consciousness (Monads) that are intrinsic parts of a universal oversoul, just as different sparks are parts of a fire. These Monads undergo a process of evolution where consciousness unfolds and matter develops. This evolution is not random, but informed by intelligence and with a purpose. Evolution follows distinct paths in accord with certain immutable laws, aspects of which are perceivable on the physical level. One such law is the law of periodicity and cyclicity; another is the law of karma or cause and effect.

==Theories on human evolution and race==

In the second volume of &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, dedicated to anthropogenesis, Blavatsky presents a theory of the gradual evolution of physical humanity over a timespan of millions of years. The steps in this evolution are called &quot;rootraces&quot;, seven in all. Earlier rootraces exhibited completely different characteristics: physical bodies first appearing in the second rootrace and sexual characteristics in the third.

Some have emphasized passages and footnotes that claim some peoples to be less fully human or spiritual than the &quot;Aryans&quot;. For example,

:&quot;Mankind is obviously divided into god-informed men and lower human creatures. The intellectual difference between the Aryan and other civilized nations and such savages as the South Sea Islanders, is inexplicable on any other grounds. No amount of culture, nor generations of training amid civilization, could raise such human specimens as the Bushmen, the Veddhas of Ceylon, and some African Tribes, to the same intellectual level as the Aryans, the Semites, and the Turanians so called. The &#x27;sacred spark&#x27; is missing in them and it is they who are the only inferior races on the globe, now happily – owing to the wise adjustment of nature which ever works in that direction – fast dying out. Verily mankind is &#x27;of one blood,&#x27; but not of the same essence. We are the hot-house, artificially quickened plants in nature, having in us a spark, which in them is latent&quot; (The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, p 421).

When discussing &quot;sterility between two human races&quot; as observed by Darwin, Blavatsky notes:

:&quot;Of such semi-animal creatures, the sole remnants known to Ethnology were the Tasmanians, a portion of the Australians and a mountain tribe in China, the men and women of which are entirely covered with hair. They were the last descendants in a direct line of the semi-animal latter-day Lemurians referred to. There are, however, considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks – e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the Veddhas of Ceylon, classed by Prof. Flower among Aryans (!), most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders, etc&quot; (The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, pp 195–6).

Blavatsky also asserts that &quot;the occult doctrine admits of no such divisions as the Aryan and the Semite, accepting even the Turanian with ample reservations. Semites, especially the Arabs, are later Aryans – degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality&quot; (The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, p 200). She also connects physical race with spiritual attributes constantly throughout her works:

:&quot;Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (Chinamen, African negroes, &amp;c.) gradually brought the worship back. The Vedas countenance no idols; all the modern Hindu writings do&quot; (The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, p 723).

According to Blavatsky, &quot;The MONADS of the lowest specimens of humanity (the &quot;narrow-brained&quot; savage South-Sea Islander, the African, the Australian) had no Karma to work out when first born as men, as their more favoured brethren in intelligence had&quot; (The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, p 168).

She also prophesies of the destruction of the racial &quot;failures of nature&quot; as the &quot;higher race&quot; ascends:

:&quot;Thus will mankind, race after race, perform its appointed cycle-pilgrimage. Climates will, and have already begun, to change, each tropical year after the other dropping one sub-race, but only to beget another higher race on the ascending cycle; while a series of other less favoured groups – the failures of nature – will, like some individual men, vanish from the human family without even leaving a trace behind&quot; (The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2, p 446).

In &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, Blavatsky states: &quot;Verily mankind is &#x27;of one blood,&#x27; but not of the same essence.&quot; Yet, she also said: &quot;True, again, that if the characteristics are accepted literally&quot;. (The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 1, p. 255).

==Critical reception==

Historian Ronald H. Fritze has written that &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; presents a &quot;series of far-fetched ideas unsupported by any reliable historical or scientific research.&quot; According to Fritze:

Unfortunately the factual basis for Blavatsky&#x27;s book is nonexistent. She claimed to have received her information during trances in which the Masters of Mahatmas of Tibet communicated with her and allowed her to read from the ancient &quot;Book of Dzyan&quot;. The &quot;Book of Dzyan&quot; was supposedly composed in Atlantis using the lost language of Senzar but the difficulty is that no scholar of ancient languages in the 1880s or since has encountered the slightest passing reference to the &quot;Book of Dzyan&quot; or the Senzar language. 

Scholars and skeptics have criticized &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; for plagiarism. It is said to have been heavily influenced by occult and oriental works. 

L. Sprague de Camp, in his book &quot;Lost Continents&quot;, wrote that Blavatsky&#x27;s main sources were &quot;H. H. Wilson&#x27;s translation of the ancient Indian &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;; Alexander Winchell&#x27;s &quot;World Life; or, Comparative Geology&quot;; Donnelly&#x27;s &quot;Atlantis&quot;; and other contemporary scientific, pseudo-scientific, and occult works, plagiarized without credit and used in a blundering manner that showed but skin-deep acquaintance with the subjects under discussion.&quot; Camp described the book as a &quot;mass of plagiarism and fakery.&quot;

The book has also been accused of antisemitism and criticized for its emphasis on race. Historian Hannah Newman has noted that the book &quot;denigrates the Jewish faith as harmful to human spirituality&quot;. Historian Michael Marrus has written that Blavatsky&#x27;s racial ideas &quot;could be easily misused&quot; and that her book had helped to foster antisemitism in Germany during World War II.

<text>The Post-Standard is a newspaper serving the greater Syracuse, New York, metro area. Published by Advance Publications, it and sister website Syracuse.com are among the consumer brands of Advance Media New York, alongside NYUp.com and &quot;The Good Life: Central New York&quot; magazine. &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; is published seven days a week and is home-delivered to subscribers on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

==History==
&quot;The Post-Standard&quot; was founded in 1829 as &quot;The Onondaga Standard&quot;. The first issue was published on September 10, 1829, after Vivus W. Smith consolidated the &quot;Onondaga Journal&quot; with the &quot;Syracuse Advertiser&quot; under &quot;The Onondaga Standard&quot; name. Through the 1800s, it was known variously as &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;The Daily Standard&quot;, and &quot;The Syracuse Standard&quot;.

On July 10, 1894, &quot;The Syracuse Post&quot; was first published. On December 26, 1898, the owners of &quot;The Daily Standard&quot; and &quot;The Syracuse Post&quot; merged the papers to form &quot;The Post-Standard&quot;. The first issue of the newly merged paper was published on January 1, 1899. The merged company was based at 136 E. Genesee St. in Syracuse.

By 1900, Syracuse had a population of 135,000, and the publication had a &quot;sworn circulation&quot; of 17,575 daily, 12,571 semi-weekly, and 15,195 on Sunday. It was touted as &quot;a clean, wholesome, aggressive, up-to-date newspaper.&quot; The newspaper bragged that &quot;&quot;The Post-Standard&quot; has a larger circulation than any other daily paper between Greater New York and Rochester.&quot;

On July 23, 1939, publisher Samuel I. Newhouse entered the Syracuse market, buying Syracuse&#x27;s two evening papers, the &quot;Syracuse Herald&quot; and the &quot;Syracuse Journal&quot;, and then merging them into the &quot;Syracuse Herald-Journal&quot;. He also launched a Sunday paper, the &quot;Herald American&quot;. In 1944, Newhouse bought &quot;The Post-Standard&quot;. (Later, Newhouse became the benefactor of Syracuse University&#x27;s acclaimed S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.)

The news and editorial departments of the newspapers operated independently from each other for decades. The &quot;Post-Standard&quot; was published in the morning, the &quot;Herald-Journal&quot; in the afternoon, and the &quot;Herald American&quot; on Sundays. Until 1971, when a new building on Clinton Square opened, the newspapers were published in separate locations. The newspapers became known collectively as The Syracuse Newspapers. By the turn of the century, it became apparent that Syracuse could no longer support two newspapers. The &quot;Herald-Journal&quot; closed in September 2001, and was merged into &quot;The Post-Standard&quot;.

The newspaper company was an early adopter of digital media. The company launched digital audio services delivered via telephone in the early 1990s, under the direction of John Mariani and Stan Linhorst. The company, under then Director of New Media Stan Linhorst, started Syracuse.com in November 1994. The newspaper collaborated with Syracuse University&#x27;s iSchool on the launch. At first, the website was branded Syracuse OnLine, and until the summer of 1995 operated on a server hosted at syr.edu. Few newspapers were establishing websites then; most were partnering with CompuServe, Prodigy (online service), America Online, or other proprietary systems.

In December 2001, the newspaper began printing on a new offset lithography press made in Switzerland by Wifag. The 750-ton five-story press allowed for color on nearly every page, and the newspaper soon began using the front-page motto &quot;America&#x27;s Most Colorful Paper&quot;. The press is housed in a 45,000-square-foot, glass-enclosed &quot;press hall&quot; constructed at the back of the newspaper building. The Wifag press replaced a 33-year-old machine using the letterpress technique. The new press and building expansion cost $39.5 million.

==21st century==
The newspaper is owned by the Newhouse family&#x27;s Advance Publications, which also publishes the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot;, &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; and &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot; in New Jersey; &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; in New Orleans; &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in Portland; and &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; in Cleveland. The Newhouse family also owns Conde Nast magazines.

In 2012, Advance established a new business structure and company, Syracuse Media Group, to emphasize its digital future. The news/editorial, advertising and marketing staffs were incorporated into that company. The offices moved to 220 South Warren Street, Syracuse. Support services for &quot;The Post-Standard&quot;, including the press and press staff, remain in the Clinton Square building at 101 North Salina Street, Syracuse. During this announcement the newspaper also announced that beginning on January 1, 2013, the paper would change its delivery to two full-sized editions on Tuesdays and Thursdays, along with its normal Sunday edition. The remaining days of the week would be smaller versions with only two sections. In 2015, the Syracuse Media Group name changed to Advance Media New York, reflecting the company&#x27;s wider geographic ambition. News coverage is overseen by Director of Content John Lammers. Advertising and marketing are overseen by Michele Sardinia, vice president of digital solutions, William Allison, vice president of sales, and Annette Peters, marketing director. Circulation and customer service are overseen by Thomas Brown.

The circulation of &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; in the first quarter of 2015 was 120,363 on Sunday, 71,101 on its home-delivered days (Tuesday and Thursday), and an average of 33,000 on its non-delivery days.

Sean Kirst is a featured news columnist and Bud Poliquin is a featured sports columnist. Kirst was the winner of the 2008 Ernie Pyle Journalism Award for human interest writing, given by the Scripps Howard Foundation to the newspaper writer nationwide who most exemplifies the works of Pyle, a famed World War II correspondent.

===Editorial board===
Marie Morelli is Editorial Opinions Leader. Others on the editorial board include Chairman Stephen A. Rogers, President Tim Kennedy, and Director of Special Projects Stan Linhorst. The board meets regularly and often hosts newsmakers or community groups.

==Awards==
&quot;The Post-Standard&quot; was named among the &quot;10 best newspapers in America with a circulation of under 100,000&quot; by Al Neuharth of &quot;USA Today&quot;.

In June 2015, the New York State Associated Press Association awarded &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; its Newspaper of Distinction award. The newspaper won the award five years in a row from 2005 through 2009.

In July 2015, the New York News Publishers Association gave eight first-place awards to &quot;The Post-Standard,&quot; the most of any newspaper in its circulation category.

The Scarborough market research company ranks Syracuse.com as the No. 1 newspaper website in the nation in terms of market penetration. Scarborough ranks &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; Sunday newspaper No. 3 in the U.S.

The Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2012 Project for Excellence in Journalism ranked &quot;The Post-Standard&quot;″s 2011 market penetration (&quot;the number of papers sold as a percentage of households in a given market&quot;) as 64%, or the fourth best in the country.

===Investigations===
In the late 1970s, &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; became more aggressive in its investigative coverage. In the 2000s, the paper published in-depth investigative pieces focusing especially on the inner workings of Albany, including Gov. George Pataki&#x27;s office and the New York Legislature. Other investigations have focused on the allocation of state-borrowed money by the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly; and on controversy over the secretive sale of public lands along the Erie Canal by the New York State Canal Corporation for less than the land&#x27;s market value.

In mid-2014, the newspaper began publishing stories from reporter John O’Brien, who uncovered serious allegations about the 1994 disappearance of Heidi Allen. The reporting raised doubts about whether the wrong person was imprisoned for her presumed killing. In dozens of stories since, O’Brien exposed flaws in the investigation and prosecution.

In 2014, Douglass Dowty won a state Associated Press first-place award for a story exposing New York state&#x27;s secretive punishment of civil confinement.

Michelle Breidenbach and Mike McAndrew revealed the misappropriation of state Empire Zone tax breaks. Their series, published 2005–2007, showed how New York state spent hundreds of millions in tax dollars on companies that had done little or nothing to deserve it. The newspaper successfully sued the state to force the release of records. The state was forced to end the program. Among the awards won by the series were the 2007 Gerald Loeb Award, which honors the nation&#x27;s best business journalism; an in-depth reporting award from Capitolbeat, a national organization for reporters who cover state and local governments; and the First Amendment award from Associated Press Managing Editors, an association of 1,500 newspapers in the U.S. and Canada.

In 2006, Breidenbach exposed wasteful spending at the New York Power Authority.

Beginning with a 2004 investigation, Breidenbach began tracking state legislators&#x27; slush funds. Her reporting revealed how state government circumvented normal borrowing policies and laws and instead funnels borrowed money through state authorities, primarily, Empire State Development and the Dormitory Authority.

In 2003, Breidenbach&#x27;s reporting revealed how the state Thruway Authority and its subsidiary, Canal Corp., granted exclusive development rights.

In 2000, staff writers Mark Libbon, James T. Mulder, and Rick Moriarty explained the forces that caused Central New York to lose its population in the 1990s. The &quot;Where We&#x27;re Going&quot; series sparked widespread discussion about the region&#x27;s future and its economic development policies. The series won recognition from the state Associated Press and the state Publisher&#x27;s Association.

==Other products from &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; staff==
&quot;The Post-Standard&quot;’s parent company, Advance Media, operates several other media. Among them:

==Community engagement==
Since 1988, &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; has been challenging people of Central New York every winter by hiding a treasure hunt medallion in a public park in Onondaga County. Each day during the treasure hunt, &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; and Syracuse.com publish clues pointing treasure hunters to its location. The person who finds the medallion wins $1,000, double that if they are a newspaper subscriber. The medallion hunt coincides with Syracuse&#x27;s annual Winterfest and the schools&#x27; winter break. In recent years, the medallion has been found at the Camillus Erie Canal Park, Onondaga Lake Park, and Green Lakes State Park.

The company conducts an annual holiday fund drive, organizing employees and dozens of community organizations to hawk special editions of donated newspapers. The campaign started in 1932, during the depths of The Great Depression, to buy coal for families who could not afford to heat their homes. Donations now go to the Christmas Bureau, sponsored by the United Way and The Salvation Army, to provide gifts, food, clothing and other support for local families in need. Early each December, the drive raises more than $50,000 each year. For decades, this was known as the Old Newsboys campaign, and recently became known as Hope for the Holidays.

In 2013, the company launched an annual &quot;Volunteer of the Year&quot; award. The honoree wins $5,000.

In 2015, the company partnered with the Landmark Theatre to launch the Syracuse High School Theatre Awards.

For decades, &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; has conducted an annual spelling bee. In recent years, the paper partnered with WCNY, which broadcasts the finale.

The company conducts annual golf and bowling tournaments, each with divisions for men, women and seniors.

Since its formation, Syracuse Media Group has hosted frequent workshops on using digital tools. Workshops have taken place at the headquarters’ building on Warren Street as well as at libraries and senior centers. Among them are how to use digital tablets, how to take better pictures with smart phones, and how to make use of social media.

In 2014, the company began hosting special events featuring news staffers with special expertise. Among them have been Talkin&#x27; Hoops with SU basketball writers Donna Ditota and Mike Waters; Talkin&#x27; Fish with outdoors writer David Figura; and CNY Conversations Live with Stan Linhorst, who conducts a weekly Q&amp;A on leadership and innovation.

The company sponsors or supports several community organizations. Among them are Syracuse Jazz Fest, Syracuse Crunch, Syracuse Stage, Symphoria, Syracuse Opera, Onondaga Historical Association, Landmark Theatre, Taste of Syracuse and Centerstate CEO economic development organization.

<text>Meow Mix is a product of The J.M. Smucker Company (as of March 23, 2015); a variety of dry and wet cat food known for its advertising jingle. Meow Mix was introduced in 1974 and sells many flavors, including &quot;Original Choice&quot; and &quot;Seafood Medley&quot;. It also is known for selling &quot;Alley Cat&quot; dry cat food. Their current slogan is &quot;it&#x27;s the only brand cats ask for by name&quot;.

== Overview ==
The Meow Mix Company operates from a facility in Decatur, Alabama, and produces Alley Cat brand cat food products. Originally a product of Ralston-Purina, Meow Mix was divested for antitrust reasons in the early 2000s. The brand was acquired by Del Monte Foods in May, 2006. Their most famous slogan is, &quot;Tastes so good, cats ask for it by name.&quot; The company was acquired by Cypress Group, a New York-based private equity firm in a $425 million leveraged buyout in 2003. Three years later, Del Monte Foods acquired the company for $705 million. The company had also been owned by J. W. Childs Associates which acquired the business in 2001 for $160 million. On March 23, 2015, parent company Big Heart Pet Brands was acquired by The J.M. Smucker Company for $5.8 billion.

==Jingle==

&quot;The Meow Mix Theme&quot; was written by Shelly Palmer in 1970. The idea came from Ron Travisano, at the advertising agency of Della Femina Travisano and Partners, who had the account with Ralston-Purina in 1974. The first TV spot aired in 1974 and consisted of animals walking across the screen. Travisano put together film footage with editor Jay Gold, looping footage of a cat, both in forward and reverse to make it look like it was &quot;singing&quot;. The music was then composed by Tom McFaul of the jingle house Lucas/McFaul, one of the major jingle-composing houses at the time. Working from Travisano&#x27;s film, McFaul wrote and produced music to fit, with the actual meowing performed by professional singer Linda November. Travisano then came up with the idea of adding English &quot;translation&quot; subtitles, along with a bouncing ball pointing out the words, which often reflected the specific flavor(s) of Meow Mix product being advertised and changed from commercial to commercial.

===Use in torture===
&quot;The Meow Mix Theme&quot; was used by the United States Central Intelligence Agency as part of torture and interrogation programs.

<text>Bernard Ralph Maybeck (February 7, 1862 – October 3, 1957) was an American architect. He worked primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area, designing public buildings, including the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and also private houses, especially in Berkeley, where he lived and taught at the University of California. A number of his works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Biography ==
Maybeck was born in New York City, the son of a German immigrant and studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, France. He moved to Berkeley, California, in 1892. He taught engineering drawing and architectural design at the University of California, Berkeley from 1894 to 1903, and acted as a mentor for a number of other important California architects, including Julia Morgan and William Wurster. In 1951, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects.

Maybeck was equally comfortable producing works in the American Craftsman, Mission Revival, Gothic revival, Arts and Crafts, and Beaux-Arts styles, believing that each architectural problem required development of an entirely new solution. While working in the office of A. Page Brown in San Francisco, Maybeck probably contributed to the Mission Style California Building at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and was one of the designers of the San Francisco Swedenborgian Church, which included the first Mission Style chair. For the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, he designed the domed Palace of Fine Arts and also the &quot;House of Hoo Hoo&quot;, a &quot;lumberman&#x27;s lodge&quot; made of rough-barked tree trunks. The Palace of Fine Arts was seen as the embodiment of Maybeck&#x27;s elaboration of how Roman architecture could fit within a California context. Maybeck said that the popular success of the Palace was due to the absence of a roof connecting the rotunda to the art gallery building, along with the absence of windows in the gallery walls and the presence near the rotunda of trees, flowers and a water feature. In 1928, he designed the Harrison Memorial Library in Carmel in a Spanish Eclectic style.

In his long-time home city of Berkeley, the 1910 &quot;First Church of Christ, Scientist, Berkeley&quot; is designated a National Historic Landmark and is considered one of his masterpieces. In 1914, he oversaw the building of the Maybeck Recital Hall in Berkeley. On flatter sites such as the city of San Francisco, the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, and the Loch Lin General Plan for Principia College in Illinois, his proposals were guided by more formal Beaux Arts planning principles.

One of Maybeck&#x27;s most interesting office buildings is the home of the Family Service Agency of San Francisco at 1010 Gough Street, from 1928, which is on the city&#x27;s Historic Building Register. Some of his larger residential projects, particularly those in the Berkeley hills such as La Loma Park, have been compared to the ultimate bungalows of the architects Greene and Greene. 

Maybeck had many ideas about town planning that he elaborated throughout his career. As a citizen of Berkeley from the 1890s, he was intimately involved in the Hillside Club. His associations and work there helped evolve ideas about hillside communities. Maybeck developed a number of firm beliefs in how civilization and the land should relate to each other. Two overriding principles would be: 1) the primacy of the landscape - geology, flora and fauna were not to be subdued by architecture so much as enhanced by architecture 2) roads should pattern the existing grade and not be an imposition upon it. There were other principles he would elucidate, such as a shared public landscape, but these were key, and helped Berkeley evolve into a paradigm for hillside living that was organic and unique. Maybeck&#x27;s visions for communities in the East Bay were also a conscientious counterpoint to across the bay where in San Francisco city planning was much more conventional, forced, and regimented into expansive grids of streets. Its grids, imposed in places on very steep grades, resulted in extremely steep streets, sidewalks and urban transitions, some almost comically so.

He also developed a comprehensive town plan for the company town of Brookings, Oregon, a clubhouse at the Bohemian Grove, and many of the buildings on the campus of Principia College in Elsah, Illinois.

A lifetime fascination with drama and the theater can be seen in much of Maybeck&#x27;s work. In his spare time, he was known to create costumes, and also designed sets for the amateur productions at the Hillside Club.

Bernard Maybeck died on October 3, 1957, aged 95, and is buried in the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.

<doc id="948107" wikidata="Q3506697" url="?curid=948107" title="Sword of Fargoal">
<text>Sword of Fargoal is a dungeon exploration video game developed by Jeff McCord and published by Epyx for the VIC-20 in 1982. It was later published for the Commodore 64 in 1983. The game was originally released on cassette tape and 5¼&quot; floppy disk formats. 

&quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; is an example of a roguelike game. Roguelike games are characterized by their progressively increasing difficulty, procedurally generated level design, and permanent death, requiring that the player start from the beginning after each failure.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a warrior who explores numerous levels of a dungeon in search of the titular &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot;. These levels are populated with a random selection of pathways, barriers, enemies, and items. As the player progresses, the stages get progressively harder. Each level is initially completely dark, but as the player investigates, it gradually grows lighter. Once the &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; is found, a countdown begins and the player must successfully escape the dungeon before the timer runs out, or the sword is lost forever.

The warrior levels up by gaining experience points, which increase the character&#x27;s fighting ability and hit points as they progress through the dungeon. There are several items in the dungeon that help the character, which can be found in treasure chests or on slain enemies.

There are several enemies in the dungeon. In general, humanoid enemies are more dangerous than other creatures. Often the game will describe the relative strength of a monster one encounters.

Combat in the game is controlled by the computer, and the player has no control over how their warrior fights. A warrior can flee an attack at any time, unless they fall victim to a sneak attack in which a monster engages in combat before the warrior has a chance to move. The warrior can move freely about the dungeon, whereas monsters take intermittently timed steps.

Each dungeon has a number of staircases that go up or down. Because each map is procedurally generated, level layouts do not remain the same after the player leaves them. Stairs also spawn wandering monsters.

The warrior can find bags of gold scattered around the dungeon. The bags can be taken by enemies if they step over them. Gold can also be stolen from the character by humanoid enemies. If those thieves are killed, the gold is returned to the warrior. The warrior can only carry 100 pieces of gold at first, but magic sacks can be found in the dungeons that allow the warrior to carry more.

Each dungeon level contains a temple. When the warrior steps into a temple, their gold is sacrificed to their deity, which earns the character additional experience. While standing in a temple, the warrior is invisible to nearby enemies.

Chests in &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; present a risk element. Some contain useful items, while others contain traps. Some chests explode, causing damage, and others release crumbling ceiling or pit traps. Chests can be picked up by enemies if they step over them.

==Development==
&quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; was created by author and programmer Jeff McCord based on his original dungeon adventure, &quot;Gammaquest II&quot;, which was programmed in BASIC for the Commodore PET computer and written in 1979-81 while they were still in high school in Lexington, Kentucky. &quot;Gammaquest II&quot;, like &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot;, created randomly generated dungeons that were revealed piece-by-piece as the character explored the map, and stayed &quot;lit&quot; behind the character as it moved, emulating the &quot;mapping&quot; of a dungeon level. Mccord based the game&#x27;s storyline on his personal Dungeons and Dragons quest from high school.

The game graphics, however, were limited to the character set of the computer.

McCord accepted an offer to publish the game from the video game developer and publisher Epyx in 1982 on the VIC-20. His original name for the new version was &quot;Sword of Fargaol&quot;, deriving the name from the Old English spelling of jail (&quot;gaol&quot;), but his producer at Epyx, Susan Lee-Merrow, convinced him to change it to its present form.

The following year, with the release of the Commodore 64, McCord was asked to release a version of &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; for that machine as well. McCord was unable to implement the conversion as it was written in BASIC, and the sprite-based graphics required machine language programming. McCord&#x27;s friend Scott Corsaire (then Carter) and Steve Lepisto wrote all the machine-language code that was needed so that game would perform fast enough to work on the Commodore 64.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; noted some bugs and inconsistencies with the documentation, but called &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; &quot;an exciting and intriguing adventure game. The graphics are beautifully crafted&quot;. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; called the VIC-20 version &quot;an engrossing adventure-type maze game&quot;. The magazine stated that the Commodore 64 version was &quot;nearly addictive&quot;, but criticized the lack of a save-game feature. It also stated that the randomized dungeons removed mapping and solving mysteries, considered to be important aspects of adventure gaming, and concluded, &quot;This game is so close to its goal, and yet so far&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1996 listed &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; as No. 147 on the &quot;Top 150 Best Video Games of All Time&quot;.

==Re-releases==
An enhanced iOS port was released in December 2009 and briefly was removed from the Apple Store before returning in October 2019 as part of the GameClub subscription service.

<text>The &quot;Lun&quot;-class ekranoplan (Soviet classification: Project 903) is the only ground effect vehicle (GEV) to ever be operationally deployed as a warship, deploying in the Caspian Flotilla. It was designed by Rostislav Alexeyev in 1975 and used by the Soviet and later Russian navies from 1987 until sometime in the late 1990s.

It flew using lift generated by the ground effect acting on its large wings when within about above the surface of the water. Although they might look similar to traditional aircraft, ekranoplans like the &quot;Lun&quot; are not classified as aircraft, seaplanes, hovercraft, or hydrofoils. Rather, craft like the &quot;Lun&quot;-class ekranoplan are classified as maritime ships by the International Maritime Organization due to their use of the ground effect, in which the craft glides just above the surface of the water.

The ground effect occurs when flying at an altitude of only a few metres above the ocean or ground; drag is greatly reduced by the proximity of the ground preventing the formation of wingtip vortices, thus increasing the efficiency of the wing. This effect does not occur at high altitude.

The name &quot;Lun&quot; comes from the Russian word for the harrier.

==Design and development==

The &quot;Lun&quot;-class ekranoplan was developed on the basis of the experimental KM ekranoplan, which was nicknamed the &quot;Caspian Sea Monster&quot;.

The &quot;Lun&quot; was powered by eight Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofans mounted on forward canards, each producing of thrust. It had a flying boat hull with a large deflecting plate at the bottom to provide a &quot;step&quot; for takeoff. It had a maximum cruising speed of .

Equipped for anti-surface warfare, it carried the P-270 &quot;Moskit&quot; (Mosquito) guided missile. Six missile launchers were mounted in pairs on the dorsal surface of its fuselage with advanced tracking systems mounted in its nose and tail.

The only model of this class ever built to completion, the MD-160, entered service with the Soviet Navy Caspian Flotilla in 1987. It was retired in the late 1990s and sat unused at a Caspian Sea naval base in Kaspiysk until 2020.

The second &quot;Lun&quot;-class ekranoplan was partially built in the late 1980s. While its construction was underway, it was redesigned as a mobile field hospital for rapid deployment to any ocean or coastal location. It was named the &quot;Spasatel&quot; (&quot;Rescuer&quot;). Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and cancellation of military funding, construction of the second craft was halted. As of 2021, the uncompleted &quot;Spasatel&quot; is stored adjacent to the Volga river in an old industrial complex within the central Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod.

The &quot;Lun&quot; design had several drawbacks. One was that although the ground effect enabled it to fly at low altitude, in order to utilize the effect it had to fly as low as off the water due to its short wingspan, so it could not fly when seas were even mildly rough. Another was that the craft was only designed to use the ground effect principle, so it could not ascend to higher cruising altitudes. The requirement for calm seas to operate, and the inability to fly above them if they were not, greatly limited where it was able to deploy.

==2020 towing operation==
On 31 July 2020, the completed MD-160 &quot;Lun&quot;-class ekranoplan was towed out of the naval base in Kaspiysk, with the intention of being eventually put on public display in Derbent, Dagestan, at the planned Patriot Park, a combination museum and theme park that will display Soviet and Russian military equipment. The towing operation involved the use of rubber pontoons, three tugboats and two escort vessels, and would have covered approximately had it been completed. However, during the tow the ekranoplan became stuck just offshore of a sandy beach, short of the intended destination.

The team managing the towing operation was unable to free the massive vehicle, so the ekranoplan was secured and remained beached in the surf zone while plans were drawn up on how to continue the move to Patriot Park. In the meantime, the unusual craft began attracting attention from the media, onlookers, and trespassing &quot;urban explorers&quot;, even before the park was built. One report published in August 2020 stated that the hull, exposed to the waves in the surf zone, was taking on water. Moving the craft to dry land beyond the surf zone would eliminate the possibility that increased wave action during storms could damage the hull further. 

In December 2020 a successful recovery operation resulted in the ekranoplan being hauled out of the water, nose-first, with the tail ending up about from the sea, as seen from satellite imagery. The ekranoplan was towed ashore on 30 December 2021.

<text>Nebracetam is an investigational drug of the racetam family that is a M1 acetylcholine receptor agonist in rats. Based on a human leukemic T cell experiment in 1991, it is believed to act as an agonist for human M1-muscarinic receptors. It is also believed to act as a nootropic, like many other racetam drugs. A chemoenzymatic method of synthesis was reported in 2008. , human trials have not yet been conducted.

<text>SS &quot;Flickertail State&quot; (T-ACS-5) is a crane ship in ready reserve for the United States Navy. She is stationed at Newport News, Virginia and is in ready reserve under the Military Sealift Command (MSC). The ship was named for the state of North Dakota, which is also known as the &quot;Flickertail State&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;Flickertail State&quot; was laid down on 14 February 1967, as the container ship CV &quot;Lightning&quot;, ON 518063, IMO 6817845, a Maritime Administration type (C5-S-73b) hull under MARAD contract (MA 206). Built by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, hull no. 355, she was launched on 11 May 1968, and delivered to MARAD 21 February 1969, entering service for American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines. She was sold to Farrell Lines in 1978 without name change. The ship was returned to MARAD in 1986 and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF). In 1987-1988 she was converted to a type (C5-S-MA73c) Crane Ship by Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock, Norfolk, Virginia. Completed on 8 February 1988, she was placed in service as SS &quot;Flickertail State&quot; (T-ACS-5) and assigned to the Ready Reserve Force (RRF), under operation control of the Military Sealift Command (MSC).

&quot;Flickertail State&quot; was assigned to Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron Three and was maintained in a four-day readiness status. &quot;Flickertail State&quot; has been in ready reserve at Newport News, Virginia since 1993.

==Large vessel lift on/lift off==
In 2009, a demonstrator crane was installed and integrated aboard the SS Flickertail State to evaluate the crane&#x27;s performance in transporting containers between two moving ships in an operational environment using commercial and oil industry at-sea mooring techniques, at sea in the Gulf of Mexico. Developed by the Sea Warfare and Weapons Department in the Office of Naval Research along with Oceaneering International, the LVI Lo/Lo crane has sensors and cameras as well as motion-sensing algorithms that let it automatically shift with the rolling and pitching of the sea, making it much easier for operators to center the crane over cargo and transfer it.

<text>William Brodie (28 September 1741 – 1 October 1788), often known by his title of Deacon Brodie, was a Scottish cabinet-maker, deacon of a trades guild, and Edinburgh city councillor, who maintained a secret life as a burglar, partly for the thrill, and partly to fund his gambling.

==Life==
William Brodie was the son of Francis Brodie, Convenor of Trades in Edinburgh. His father&#x27;s eminent position allowed William to become the Deacon of Wrights and Masons around 1781.

In 1774, Brodie&#x27;s mother is listed as the head of household in their Edinburgh home on Brodie&#x27;s Close on the Lawnmarket. The family (William and his brothers) are listed as &quot;wrights and undertakers&quot; on the Lawnmarket. By 1787 William Brodie is listed alone as a wright living at Brodie&#x27;s Close. The house was built towards the foot of the close in 1570, on the south east side of an open court, by Edinburgh magistrate William Little, and the close was known as Little&#x27;s Close until the 18th century.

With &#x27;improvements&#x27; being made to Edinburgh, the mansion was demolished around 1835 and is now covered by Victoria Terrace. (At a later date, Brodie&#x27;s workshops and woodyard, which were situated at the lower extremity of the close, made way for the foundations of the Free Library Central Library on George IV Bridge.)

By day, Brodie was a respectable tradesman and Deacon (president) of the Incorporation of Wrights, which controlled the craft of cabinetmaking in Edinburgh, and this made him a member of the town council. Part of his work as a cabinetmaker was to install and repair locks and other security mechanisms. He socialised with the gentry of Edinburgh and met the poet Robert Burns and the painter Henry Raeburn. He was a member of the Edinburgh Cape Club and was known by the pseudonym &quot;Sir Llyud&quot;.

At night, however, Brodie became a burglar and thief. He used his daytime work as a way to gain knowledge about the security mechanisms of his customers and to copy their keys using wax impressions. As the foremost locksmith of the city, Brodie was asked to work in the houses of many of the richest members of Edinburgh society. He used the money he made dishonestly to maintain his second life, which included a gambling habit and five children by two mistresses, who did not know of each other and were unknown in the city.

He reputedly began his criminal career around 1768, when he copied keys to a bank door and stole £800, then enough to maintain a household for several years. In 1786 he recruited a gang of three thieves: John Brown, a thief on the run from a seven-year sentence of transportation; George Smith of Berkshire, a locksmith who ran a grocer&#x27;s shop in the Cowgate; and Andrew Ainslie, a shoemaker. By 1785 Brodie was spending his evenings gambling at a tavern on Fleshmarket Close owned by a Mr Clark. But his public reputation was high, and in the summer of 1788 he was chosen to sit on a jury in the High Court.

==Capture and trial==
The case that led to Brodie&#x27;s downfall began on 5 March 1788, when he organised an armed raid on the excise office in Chessels Court, on the Canongate. He had made a copy of the entry key using putty on an earlier visit and, having made a key, simply unlocked the door. Brodie was accompanied by Smith, Ainslie, and Brown. All were dressed in black, and Brodie and Brown each carried a pair of flintlock pistols. They began around 8pm. Brodie was in high spirits and singing numbers from &quot;The Beggars Opera&quot;. They knew that although the excise office was closed, the night watchman did not come until 10pm. On arrival at Chessels Court, Ainslie stood watch outside.

The plan was disturbed when James Bonar returned to his office unexpectedly at 8.30 pm. The gang escaped with only £16. Brodie hurried home, changed into more normal clothes, and went to the house of his mistress Jean Watt, on Libertons Wynd, hoping to create an alibi.

On the same night, Brown approached the authorities to claim a King&#x27;s Pardon, which had been offered after a previous robbery, and gave up the names of Smith and Ainslie (initially saying nothing of Brodie&#x27;s involvement). Brown also showed the authorities a cache of duplicate keys hidden under a stone at the base of Salisbury Crags.

Smith and Ainslie were arrested, and the next day Brodie attempted to visit them in prison but was refused. Realising that he had to leave Edinburgh, Brodie travelled southwards and reached Dover in 18 days, closely pursued by George Williamson, a King&#x27;s Messenger. There Williamson lost the trail. Brodie then backtracked to London, where he stayed until 23 March. He then boarded the Leith ship &quot;Endeavour&quot; under the name of John Dixon. &quot;Endeavor&quot; was returning to Edinburgh, but Brodie paid the ship to detour and drop him off in Flushing, the Netherlands, whence he travelled to Ostend. However, on the boat he had given a Mr Geddes several letters to deliver to another mistress, on Cant&#x27;s Close in Edinburgh. Geddes was suspicious and gave the letters to the authorities in Edinburgh. Williamson resumed his pursuit and found Brodie in Amsterdam, where he was planning to flee to the United States. Brodie was returned to Edinburgh for trial.

The trial of Brodie and Smith started on 27 August 1788. At first there was no hard evidence against Brodie, although the tools of his criminal trade (copied keys, a disguise, and pistols) were found in his house and workshops. But with the evidence provided by Brown and Ainslie, who had been persuaded to turn King&#x27;s Evidence, along with the self-incriminating lines in the letters Brodie had written while on the run, the jury found Brodie and Smith guilty.

Brodie and Smith were hanged at the Old Tolbooth, on the High Street, on 1 October 1788 before a crowd of 40,000, including Brodie&#x27;s 10-year-old daughter, Cecil(e). The rope had to be adjusted in length three times as the bell of the adjacent St Giles Cathedral tolled.

According to one tale, Brodie wore a steel collar and silver tube to prevent the hanging from being fatal. It was said that he had bribed the hangman to ignore it and arranged for his body to be removed quickly in the hope that he could later be revived. If so, the plan failed. Brodie was buried in an unmarked grave in the northeast corner of the graveyard at St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Chapel of Ease, on Chapel Street.

However, rumours that he had been seen in Paris circulated later, giving the story of his scheme to evade death further publicity.

==Cultural references==
Popular myth holds that Deacon Brodie built the first gallows in Edinburgh and was also its first victim. Of this, William Roughead in &quot;Classic Crimes&quot; states that after research, he was sure that although the Deacon may have had some hand in the design, &quot;...it was certainly not of his construction, nor was he the first to benefit by its ingenuity&quot;.


Robert Louis Stevenson, whose father owned furniture that had been made by Brodie, wrote a play (with W. E. Henley) entitled &quot;Deacon Brodie, or The Double Life,&quot; which was unsuccessful. However, Stevenson remained fascinated by the dichotomy between Brodie&#x27;s respectable façade and his real nature, and this paradox inspired him to write the novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, which he published in 1886.

Deacon Brodie is commemorated by a pub of that name on Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile, on the corner of the Lawnmarket and Bank Street which leads down to the Mound; and a close off the Royal Mile, which contained his family residence and workshops, bears the name &quot;Brodie&#x27;s Close&quot;.

A further two pubs carry his name, one in New York City on the south side of the famous west side 46th Street Restaurant Row between Eighth and Ninth avenues, and the other in Ottawa, Canada on the corner of Elgin and Cooper.

The titular character of the novel &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; by the Scottish author Muriel Spark claims to be descended from Deacon Brodie. His double life serves as a metaphor for her duplicity, as well as her self-imposed demise. The novel has been adapted into a play, film, and television series.

In 1989, Bathgate rock band Goodbye Mr Mackenzie wrote and recorded a track titled &quot;Here Comes Deacon Brodie&quot;, which appeared on the B-side to their hit &quot;The Rattler&quot;.

The &quot;Deacon Brodie&quot; episode of the BBC One television drama anthology &quot;Screen One&quot; starred Billy Connolly as Brodie, aired on 8 March 1997, and was made in Edinburgh.

From 1976 to 1989, Deacon Brodie was a figure in the Chamber of Horrors section of the Edinburgh Wax Museum on the Royal Mile.

<text>Joachim Lelewel (22 March 1786 – 29 May 1861) was a Polish historian, geographer, bibliographer, polyglot and politician.

==Life==
Born in Warsaw to a Polonized Prussian family, Lelewel was educated at the Imperial University of Vilna, where in 1814 he became a lecturer in history, with a brief sojourn at Warsaw, 1818–1821, where he joined the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning. His lectures on Polish history created great enthusiasm, as shown in some lines addressed to him by Adam Mickiewicz that led to Lelewel&#x27;s removal by the Russians in 1824.

Five years later, Lelewel returned to Warsaw, where he was elected a deputy to the Sejm of Congress Poland. He joined the November 1830 Uprising with more enthusiasm than energy, though Tsar Nicholas I identified him as one of the most dangerous rebels. He is considered the author of the motto: &quot;For our freedom and yours&quot;. On the suppression of the rebellion, Lelewel made his way in disguise to Germany and subsequently reached Paris in 1831. The government of Louis Philippe ordered him to quit French territory in 1833 at the request of the Russian ambassador. The cause of the expulsion is said to have been his writing of revolutionary proclamations. He went to Brussels, where for nearly thirty years he earned a scanty livelihood by his writings.

In 1846 Lelewel joined the Polish Democratic Association and before the 1846 Kraków uprising he wrote an appeal &quot;To my countrymen in the Ukraine&quot;.

In 1847, he, together with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, became a founding member and &quot;Vizepräses&quot; (vice president) of the &quot;Demokratische Gesellschaft zur Einigung und Verbrüderung aller Völker&quot; (Democratic Society for Unity and Brotherhood of All Peoples), seated in Brussels. The anarchist Michail Bakunin was strongly influenced by him.

During the first years of Alexander II of Russia as the Emperor of Russia, Lelewel laid some hope on the beginning of liberalization.

Lelewel died 29 May 1861 in Paris, where he had moved a few days earlier. First interred there, his body was transferred to the Rasos Cemetery in Vilnius, in accord with his wishes.

==Works==
His literary activity in Polish and, to a more international audience in French, was enormous, extending from his &quot;Edda skandynawska&quot; (&quot;The Scandinavian Edda&quot;, 1807) to his &quot;Géographie des Arabes&quot; (1851). One of his most important publications was &quot;La Géographie du moyen âge&quot; (5 vols., 1852–1857), with an atlas (1849) of fifty plates entirely engraved by himself, for he attached such importance to the accuracy of his maps that he would not allow them to be executed by anyone else.

His historical works were popular in Ukraine especially among members of the Ruthenian Trinity and the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius (particularly historian Mykola Kostomarov).

His works on Polish history are based on minute and critical study of the documents; they were collected under the title &quot;Polska, dzieje i rzeczy jej rozpatrzywane&quot; (Poland, Her History and Affairs Surveyed), in 20 vols. (1853–1876). He intended to write a complete history of Poland on an extensive scale, but never accomplished the task. His method is shown in the &quot;little history&quot; of Poland, first published at Warsaw in Polish in 1823, under the title &quot;Dzieje Polski&quot;, and afterwards largely rewritten in the &quot;Histoire de Pologne&quot; (2 vols., 1844). Other works on Polish history which may be especially mentioned are &quot;La Pologne au moyen âge&quot; (Poland in the Middle Ages, 3 vols., 1846–1851), an edition of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Matthew Cholewaski (1811) and &quot;Ancient Memorials of Polish Legislation&quot; (&quot;Księgi ustaw polskich i mazowieckich&quot;). He also wrote on the trade of Carthage, on the geographer Pytheas of Marseille, and two important works on numismatics (&quot;La Numismatique du moyen âge&quot;, 2 vols., 1835; &quot;Etudes numismatiques&quot;, 1840). While employed in the Warsaw University library, he studied bibliography, and the fruits of his labors may be seen in his &quot;Bibliograficznych Ksiąg dwoje&quot; (Two Bibliographic Books, 2 vols., 1823–1826).

Lelewel wrote an autobiography (Adventures while Prosecuting Researches and Inquiries on Polish Matters), printed in his &quot;Polska&quot; (Poland).

<text>Chameleon was a record label formed by producer, music entrepreneur and former Capitol Records A&amp;R executive Stephen Powers, in association with Bob Marin, Managing Director of alternative rock importer Sounds Good, and Richard Foos, co-founder of Rhino Records.

==Formation==
An experienced indie label chief who previously founded Mountain Railroad Records and later Drive Entertainment, Powers quickly signed a distribution agreement with Capitol/EMI, bought out Marin and Foos, and brought in Hyatt Hotel heir, Daniel Pritzker, as a financial partner.

Pritzker was also a musician and songwriter, whose band Sonia Dada, later scored a #1 pop hit in Australia titled &quot;You Don&#x27;t Treat Me No Good,&quot; on the Chameleon label through Festival Records. Powers staffed Chameleon Music Group with industry veterans like Andy Frances, Bill Meehan, and the company grew quickly with 2-tiered, major-label distribution for its flagship Chameleon label and independent distribution for its many alternative imprints.

In 1991, Chameleon was named Independent Label of the Year by National Association of Independent Distributors (NAIRD), and Powers was named Independent Music Executive of the Year.

Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz was an employee, and Chameleon distributed his early Epitaph releases, such as L7&#x27;s self-titled debut and T.S.O.L. Chameleon also distributed Minneapolis-based Twin/Tone Records and released the first albums by The Replacements, Soul Asylum and Hüsker Dü; punk label Posh Boy Records (Black Flag, Agent Orange, Redd Kross, Rodney on the ROQ) and had a subsidiary of their own called Dali Records. Chameleon also acquired and relaunched the legendary Chicago Blues Soul label, Vee-Jay Records.

The label won a Grammy award for Best Contemporary Blues Recording for &quot;I&#x27;m In The Mood,&quot; a duet by John Lee Hooker and Bonnie Raitt from its 1990 release of Hooker&#x27;s best-selling album, &quot;The Healer&quot;, also featuring Carlos Santana, Robert Cray, Canned Heat, Los Lobos, Charlie Musslewhite, and others.

In the first years of the label&#x27;s existence, Chameleon was distributed by Capitol/EMI in the USA, A&amp;M Records of Canada, Festival Records in Australia, BMG in Europe, and various independent distributors. In the last years of the label&#x27;s existence, Chameleon was distributed worldwide by Elektra Records.

Overall artists included the following:
John Lee Hooker, Kyuss, Dramarama, Lowen &amp; Navarro, New Marines, Mary&#x27;s Danish, Way Moves, Spooner (w/ Butch Vig, Duke Erikson), Sigmund Snopek III, Ecotour, Lucinda Williams, Ferron, Ethyl Meatplow, Bel Canto, and Black Cat Bone.

<text>Tulse Luper is a fictional character, created by film director Peter Greenaway.
&quot;Born in Newport (Greenaway&#x27;s own birthplace) in 1911, Luper was, according to Greenaway&#x27;s introduction to the exhibition catalogue, in Moab, Utah in 1928 when &quot;Uranium was &#x27;discovered&#x27; there. He was in Antwerp in 1939 when the Germans invaded Belgium. He was in Rome when the Americans arrived in 1944. He met Raoul Wallenberg in Budapest in 1945 and followed him to Moscow in the 1950s. He was at an East-West German checkpoint in 1963&quot; ( Luper at Compton Verney ). The 92 suitcases thus tell Luper&#x27;s story from 1928 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, sketching not so much the biography of one man as the story of a century related through some of its key events.&quot;

== Character overview ==
Tulse Luper is mentioned in Greenaway&#x27;s early films &quot;A Walk Through H: The Reincarnation of an Ornithologist&quot;, &quot;Vertical Features Remake&quot;, &quot;The Falls&quot; and &quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot;, and appears as the major character in &quot;The Tulse Luper Suitcases&quot;. In this film, it is suggested that he is a fiction created by Martino Knockavelli, a childhood friend who feels responsible for his death in an accident. His imagined life story was also told in a series of films and multimedia exhibitions called The Tulse Luper Suitcases.

==Character analysis==
In an interview given with salon.com, Peter Greenaway stated &quot;Tulse Luper is a sort of alter ego created many years ago -- Tulse could be said to rhyme with the pulse in your wrist, and Luper is a corruption of the Latin for wolf. So how about &quot;danger lurking at the very door of your life?&quot;

It has also been mentioned by Greenaway that the construction of Tulse Luper was based on &quot;a cache of old photographs in a trunk&quot; of a gentleman at a car boot sale whose weathered countenance resembled Samuel Beckett. Beckett&#x27;s literary influence has been reflected in Greenaway&#x27;s work.

<doc id="948133" wikidata="Q2909895" url="?curid=948133" title="Dick Contino">
<text>Richard Joseph &quot;Dick&quot; Contino (January 17, 1930 – April 19, 2017) was an American accordionist and singer.

==Early life==
Contino was born in Fresno, California. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Contino, and he attended Fresno High School. He studied accordion primarily with San Francisco-based Angelo Cognazzo, and occasionally with Los Angeles-based Guido Deiro. At the age of about 6 or 7 years old he exhibited great virtuosity on the instrument. 

Although he graduated from Fresno High School in 1947 and enrolled at Fresno State College, he was unable to concentrate on his studies. Contino explained, &quot;I enjoyed college, but while attending classes I kept thinking that if I was going to be a success, it would be my music that would take me there.&quot; He also played piano, clarinet, and saxophone.

==Early career==
Contino got his big break on December 7, 1947, at age 17, when he played &quot;Lady of Spain&quot; (his signature piece) and won first place in the Horace Heidt/Philip Morris talent contest in Fresno, which was broadcast on national radio. Contino also won first place in subsequent competitions in Los Angeles, Omaha, Des Moines, Youngstown, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and New York City. He won first place in the final round on December 12, 1948, in Washington, D.C. 

Contino made many recordings from the latter 1940s to the early 1960s, particularly for Mercury Records and Dot Records. Eddie Fisher had much better success with Contino&#x27;s &quot;Lady of Spain&quot; in 1952. Contino&#x27;s song &quot;Yours&quot; was his first hit single. The song reached #27 on the U.S. pop charts in 1954. His second and only other hit single was &quot;Pledge My Love.&quot; It reached #42 on the U.S. pop charts in 1957.

Contino toured with the Horace Heidt Orchestra and was billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest accordion player.&quot; He appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; a record 48 times.

==Military service==
Contino&#x27;s career was interrupted when he was drafted during the Korean War. He fled from pre-induction barracks at Fort Ord out of extreme, unpublicized phobias and neuroses. In 1951, he pled guilty to evasion and was sentenced to serve six months at McNeil Island Corrections Center. 

He was inducted into the army in 1952, having served four and a half months of his sentence. He was honorably discharged with the rank of staff sergeant. Although he received a presidential pardon, the scandal dealt Contino&#x27;s career a serious blow. He continued to perform, and acted in a few movies in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Later career==

Contino&#x27;s acting became known to a new generation in 1991, when &quot;Daddy-O&quot;, a low-budget 1958 movie in which he starred as a faddishly-dressed beat rebel and singer, was shown on a third-season episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. The show also riffed the 1959 film &quot;Girls Town&quot;, in which Contino appeared with other musical performers, such as Paul Anka and The Platters.

He continued to perform regularly throughout the United States. His repertoire was eclectic, ranging from Italian songs such as &quot;Come Back to Sorrento&quot; and &quot;Arrivederci Roma&quot; to standards like &quot;Lady of Spain&quot; and &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot;.

==Personal life==
Contino was married to Leigh Snowden for 26 years. They had three children together. They lived in Las Vegas.

==Novella and other fictional works==

James Ellroy wrote a novella, &quot;Dick Contino&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which is a mini-memoir and crime story based on Contino&#x27;s experiences as a struggling artist after the war. It is included in the 1994 Ellroy short story collection &quot;Hollywood Nocturnes&quot;. A version appeared in issue number 46 of Granta magazine (Winter 1994) along with several photographs of Contino and the author. Ellroy also penned a short story entitled &quot;Hollywood Shakedown&quot;, which appeared in his collected work &quot;Crime Wave&quot; and featured Contino as the central character. 

The story was entirely fictitious, as it features numerous incidents of violence and murder which Contino had never been linked with or accused of in reality.

He appeared briefly in Ellroy&#x27;s &quot;American Tabloid&quot;, the first book of his Underworld USA Trilogy, performing at a mafia-financed Cuban exile military training camp (&quot;Contino played &#x27;Lady Of Spain&#x27; six thousand times.&quot;).

In 2012, a biography of Contino&#x27;s life, &quot;The Beauty of Imperfection&quot;, was published.

==Death==
Contino died on April 19, 2017, in Fresno, at the age of 87.

<doc id="948139" wikidata="Q5436839" url="?curid=948139" title="Fasoracetam">
<text>Fasoracetam () is an experimental drug of the racetam group which was never marketed. It is a putative nootropic that failed to show sufficient efficacy in clinical trials for vascular dementia. The drug was also subsequently repurposed for treatment of a variety of other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but effectiveness for ADHD was disappointing and development of fasoracetam for most other conditions has been discontinued as well. In any case, it remains under development for treatment of DiGeorge syndrome.

==Pharmacology==
Fasoracetam appears to modulate and stimulate all three groups of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). It has been found to improve certain aspects of cognitive function in rodent studies. The drug is orally bioavailable and is excreted mostly unchanged in urine.

==Chemistry==
Fasoracetam is a racetam and a derivative of pyroglutamic acid.

==History==
Fasoracetam was developed in the late 1980s. It was discovered by scientists at the Japanese pharmaceutical company Nippon Shinyaku, which brought it through Phase 3 clinical trials for vascular dementia, and abandoned it due to lack of efficacy. Subsequently, fasoracetam was repurposed for treatment of ADHD and other indications.

Scientists at Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia led by Hakon Hakonarson have studied fasoracetam&#x27;s potential use in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Hakonarson&#x27;s company neuroFix tried to bring the drug to market for this use; neuroFix acquired Nippon Shinyaku&#x27;s clinical data as part of its efforts. neuroFix was acquired by Medgenics in 2015. Medgenics changed its name to Aevi Genomic Medicine in 2016. 

Clinical trials in adolescents with ADHD who also have mGluR mutations started in 2016. While fasoracetam may be effective in the treatment of ADHD in people with specific mGluR mutations, these represent around 10% of total ADHD cases, and fasoracetam is likely ineffective in all other cases. Studies showing improvements in cognitive function from fasoracetam have exclusively been done on rodents.

==Society and culture==
===Legality===
====Australia====
Fasoracetam is a schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 4 substance is classified as &quot;Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription.&quot;

==Research==
Fasoracetam was originally developed for treatment of cognitive impairment related to dementia. It reached phase 3 clinical trials for this indication. However, development was discontinued due to lack of effectiveness and fasoracetam was never marketed.

Fasoracetam (developmental code names AEVI-001, LAM-105, MDGN-001, NFC-1, NS-105) was under development by Avalo Therapeutics (previously Cerecor) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autistic disorder, cognition disorders, DiGeorge syndrome, and major depressive disorder. However, development for all indications was discontinued by 2018. The drug (developmental code name NB-001) is also under development by Nobias Therapeutics for the treatment of DiGeorge syndrome and is in phase 2 clinical trials for this use as of October 2023. A co-crystallized form of fasoracetam (developmental code name AEVI-004) is under development by Avalo Therapeutics for the treatment of ADHD, autistic disorder, and epilepsy as well. However, no recent development has been reported for these indications as of April 2023. Pharmaceutical developmental code names of fasoracetam include 

The results of clinical studies of fasoracetam for ADHD have been disappointing.

<text>Antonio Cifra (1584? – 2 October 1629 in Loreto) was an Italian composer of the Roman School of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He was one of the significant transitional figures between the Renaissance and Baroque styles, and produced music in both idioms.

==Life and works==
Son of Costanzo and Claudia, Antonio Cifra was born perhaps in Bassiano (near Terracina). He studied with Giovanni Bernardino Nanino from 27 June 1594 at San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome and then, from 18 January 1597, he was boy soprano of the Cappella Giulia at St Peter. From 1605 to 1607 he was &quot;maestro&quot; at the Roman Seminary, and from 1608 to 1609 he held the same position at the German College in Rome. In 1609 he was hired as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Santa Casa in Loreto, where he remained the rest of his life. Cultural connections between Loreto and Rome were close (since Loreto was a pilgrimage destination), and he maintained contact with the composers in Rome during this period. Near the end of his life he took part in several large musical events in Rome, including a large Vespers at St. Peter&#x27;s for which he &quot;batteva&quot; (beat time) for one of the choirs.

Cifra was a prolific composer, with 45 separate publications to his credit: they included psalms, motets, litanies, &quot;Scherzi sacri,&quot; masses, polychoral motets, and sacred songs, as well as secular music including madrigals in both the Renaissance &quot;a cappella&quot; and Baroque concertato forms.

Stylistically, Cifra&#x27;s music varies between masses in the Palestrina style, with much use of homophony (as desired by the Counter-Reformation Council of Trent, which had required that polyphonic elaboration be minimized so as to allow for clear expression of the text), and more progressive works in the Venetian style. He also used the technique of monody, as pioneered in northern Italy, for some of his solo madrigals. Some of his concertato madrigals are like small cantatas, and can be seen as foreshadowing this development, which began around the time he died.

Cifra was also one of the very few composers to be influenced by the extreme chromaticism of Carlo Gesualdo. While Cifra did not adopt the technique for many works, or for long, he did publish one book of madrigals which appear to be deliberate copies of Gesualdo&#x27;s style (the &quot;Madrigali concertati libro quinto&quot;, 1621). For these madrigals he used 18 of Gesualdo&#x27;s own texts.

<text>Irish Quebecers (, ) are residents of the Canadian province of Quebec who have Irish ancestry. In 2016, there were 446,215 Quebecers who identified themselves as having partial or exclusive Irish descent in Quebec, representing 5.46% of the population.

==Demographics==
As of the 2016 census, there were 446,215 Quebecers who identified themselves as Irish representing 5.46% of the population.

In the city of Montreal, there are 92,145 people of declared Irish heritage.

Irish culture and community organizations are mostly kept alive by the English-speaking population such as the United Irish Societies of Montreal. Most of the descendents of the Irish population settled in Quebec assimilated into the French-speaking majority population. In the whole province, it&#x27;s estimated that a third of the population descend from Irish individuals.

Irish traditional dances and music, such as jigs and fiddling are partly an inspiration for traditionnal dances and music in Quebec.

==Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade==
The longest-running Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Canada is held each year in Montreal, Quebec. The parades have been held since 1824 and have been organized by the United Irish Societies of Montreal since 1929. However, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day itself has been celebrated in Montreal as far back as 1759 by Irish soldiers in the Montreal Garrison during the British conquest of New France.


==History==

=== New France (1608–1763) ===
In the seventeenth century, Irish residing in France were among those sent to colonize the Saint Lawrence Valley in New France. After the Reformation, Irish Catholic nobility, soldiers, and clergy would serve Catholic Monarchs in France, Spain, and the Low Countries. Nearly 35,000 Irish served in the French military in the seventeenth century. By 1700 there were approximately one hundred Irish-born families among the 2,500 families registered in New France, along with an additional thirty families of mixed Irish and French backgrounds. Only 10 colonists had arrived from Ireland directly. In the early eighteenth century, many Irish Catholics arrived from New England seeking to practice their religion more freely. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, French authorities also encouraged desertion among the Irish serving in the British army in North America. In 1757, Governor Pierre Rigaud de Vaudreuil raised an Irish company consisting of deserters and prisoners of war who had served with the enemy British army; this company returned to France after the war. Most of these Irish soldiers, settlers, and deserters assimilated into French-Canadian society.

===Lower Canada (early 1800s)===

Overpopulation and the enclosure movement in Ireland along with established commercial shipping routes between Quebec City and ports in Dublin and Liverpool encouraged large waves of Irish emigration to Lower Canada starting in 1815. Most of these emigrants would come to cities in Lower Canada, establishing Irish communities in Montreal (1817) and Quebec City (1819). In Quebec, most Irish Catholics settled close to the harbour in the Lower Town working in the shipyards and on the wharves. By 1830, they constituted 7,000 of 32,000 inhabitants. The Montreal population was more transient, attracted to labor in large construction projects such as the Lachine Canal before moving on to Upper Canada and the United States. In 1825 Irish Catholics and Protestants constituted about 3,000 people out of a total city population of 25,000 and were about equal in number. Irish Catholics in formed distinctive neighbourhoods in the western portion of the city and later in Griffintown near the Lachine Canal works. Irish Catholic settlers also opened up new agricultural areas in the recently surveyed Eastern Townships, the Ottawa valley, and Gatineau and Pontiac counties. Irish from Quebec would also settle in communities such as Frampton, Saint Sylvestre, and Saint Patrick in the Beauce region of southeastern Quebec.

Irish became heavily involved in political life and newspaper publishing in Montreal. Many Irish leaders were involved in the Parti Canadien, Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, and other French Canadian republican patriotic groups involved in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837-1838. The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Society of Montréal was founded in 1834 as an Irish patriotic organization with a political motive to counter the republican sentiments, with both Catholic and Protestant members sharing values of loyalty to the British Crown. The society vigorously defended the colonial government during the rebellion.

=== The Great Irish Famine and Confederation (1840s to 1870s) ===

Canada East saw a substantial increase in immigration from Ireland during the Great Irish Famine (1845–1849). In 1847 alone, close to 100 000 arrived in Grosse Isle, an island in present-day Quebec which housed the immigration reception station. Thousands died or were treated in the hospital (equipped for fewer than one hundred patients); in fact, many boats that reached Grosse-Île had lost the bulk of their passengers and crew, and many more died in quarantine on or near the island. From Grosse-Île, most survivors were sent to Montreal. In 1909, a Celtic cross was erected on the island to commemorate the tragedy. Orphaned children were adopted into Quebec families and accordingly became Québécois, both linguistically and culturally. Some of these children fought for their right to keep their Irish surnames, and were largely successful.
In the 1840s and 1850s, Irish immigrants laboured on the Victoria Bridge, living in a tent city at the foot of the bridge (see Goose Village, Montreal). Here, workers unearthed a mass grave of 6000 Irish immigrants who had died in an earlier typhus epidemic. The Irish Stone remains at the bridge entrance to commemorate the tragedy. The Irish would go on to settle permanently in the close-knit working-class neighbourhoods of Pointe-Saint-Charles and Griffintown, working in the nearby flour mills, factories, and sugar refineries.

The famine hardened the attitude of Irish Catholics towards the British and Irish Protestants. Irish Catholics would fight fiercely to preserve a distinct identity from both Quebec Protestants and French Canadian Catholic populations. With the help of Quebec&#x27;s Irish Catholic Church led by priests such as Father Patrick Dowd, they would establish their own churches, schools, and hospitals. St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica was founded in 1847 and served Montreal&#x27;s English-speaking Catholics for over a century. The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Society would be revived as a Catholic organization in 1856. Distinct English Catholic schools, affiliated with French Catholic school boards, developed in the 1840s and 1850s.

The famine also radicalized a portion of the Irish population. The Fenian movement in Ireland and the United States sought to overthrow British rule in Ireland. The Fenian Brotherhood in the United States organized raids across the border into Canada in an attempt to seize control of the British colony. Irish Protestants used the Orange Order to assert British rule in Ireland and Canada, and espoused anti-Catholic views. D&#x27;Arcy McGee, an Irish Montrealer serving as a Cabinet Minister in the Great Coalition Government, strongly opposed both the Orange Order and Fenians. He worked as a Cabinet Minister within the Great Coalition government to ensure that the rights of Catholics were protected in the new Confederation of provinces in British North America in 1867. As a result, Catholic school boards became enshrined in the Canadian Constitution in 1867. They were abolished and merged with Protestant schools into English school boards after a Constitutional amendment in 2001. McGee was assassinated by Fenians as a traitor in 1868.

=== Post-Confederation and modern-day Quebec ===
English language Irish Catholic institutions continued to expand in the late 19th and early 20th century. Loyola College (Montreal) was founded by the Jesuits to serve Montreal&#x27;s mostly Irish English-speaking Catholic community in 1896. Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital was founded in the 1920s and continues to serve Montreal&#x27;s present-day English-speaking population.

One of the greatest influences the Irish had and still have on their new compatriots is within music. The music of Quebec has adopted, and adapted, the Irish reel as its own.

The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade of Montreal, Quebec is still the oldest organized large parade of its kind in Canada. On March 17, 2008, on the 175th anniversary of Montreal&#x27;s St. Patrick Society, Quebec Premier Jean Charest announced the creation of the Johnson chair of Irish studies at Concordia University.

<doc id="948163" wikidata="Q6256792" url="?curid=948163" title="John Saxon (educator)">
<text>John Harold Saxon Jr. (December 10, 1923 – October 17, 1996) was an American mathematics educator who authored or co-authored and self-published a series of textbooks, collectively using an incremental teaching style which became known as Saxon math.

== Early life and military service ==
Saxon was born in Georgia to parents John Harold and Zollie McArthur Saxon. He graduated from Athens High School in 1941 in Athens, Georgia, and later attended the University of Georgia.

He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1949 and his master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1961. He became an officer in the United States Army Air Forces, commanding a B-17 Flying Fortress in World War II. He later joined United States Air Force, flying 55 missions in a B-26 Invader on Night Intruder missions during the Korean War and reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1953, he survived a crash when a B-25 Mitchell engine failed on takeoff. That year, he also received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Saxon also taught engineering at the United States Air Force Academy for five years.

After his retirement from the Air Force in the 1970, he settled in Norman, Oklahoma. He taught algebra part-time at Rose State College in Midwest City, Oklahoma.

== Technique development ==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Saxon spoke out against mathematics education reform efforts that he believed would lead to a disaster in math and science education. He wrote or co-wrote a series of nine mathematics textbooks for kindergarten through high school which use an incremental teaching method often called &quot;Saxon math&quot;. According to Saxon in media interviews from the 1980s and early 1990s and documentation coming with the high-school level textbooks, the inclusion of specialised and/or somewhat uncommon words such as &quot;sciolist&quot; in the story problems is intended as a vocabulary builder in preparation for the verbal section of the SAT and similar tests.

The basic philosophy of his approach was incremental development and continuous review. Incremental development meant that larger concepts were broken down into smaller, more easily understood pieces that were introduced over time; continuous review refers to the practice of concepts in cumulative problem sets once they were introduced. As a student completed a new concept, a brief review of the previous chapters and concepts were also tested.

Educators critical of his method felt that the lessons were too drill-oriented and time-consuming, did not allow students to use calculators, and differed from other methods by not encouraging teamwork or developing creative problem-solving skills.

== Publishing company ==
Saxon started his textbook publishing company when he was unable to find a publisher for his high school algebra manuscript. He mortgaged his house to raise the funds for it. He initially named his textbook publishing company Grassdale Publishers, after the name of his grandmother&#x27;s farm in Georgia. Later, he changed the name of his company to Saxon Publishers. His first textbook was published in 1981 and had a very distinctive cover with a blue background and orange letters spelling out the word algebra.

Saxon came into national prominence by conservative thinker and publisher William F. Buckley. Buckley announced Saxon&#x27;s success on the front page of the &quot;National Review&quot; magazine in 1981 with the headline &quot;Supply-side Algebra.&quot; After his first book was published, Saxon published more books: &quot;Algebra 1 1/2&quot;, &quot;Algebra 1/2&quot; and &quot;Geometry, Trigonometry and Algebra 3&quot;. (He later renamed his book &quot;Algebra 1 1/2&quot; simply &quot;Algebra 2&quot;). His reasoning for titling his second textbook &quot;Algebra 1 1/2&quot; is that a good part of the book was a review of &quot;Algebra 1 topics&quot;. Later, he co-authored his &quot;Calculus with Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry&quot; textbook with Frank Wang, then a graduate student in mathematics at MIT.

As Saxon published books that he authored or co-authored, he found other authors to write books all the way down to kindergarten level. Stephen Hake of El Monte, California authored books for 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th grades titled &quot;Math 54&quot;, &quot;Math 65&quot;, &quot;Math 76&quot; and &quot;Math 87&quot;. Nancy Larson of West Haven, Connecticut authored programs titled &quot;Math K&quot;, &quot;Math 1&quot;, &quot;Math 2&quot; and &quot;Math 3&quot;. Other books produced by the publishing company included &quot;Saxon Phonics and Spelling&quot; for kindergarten through third grade, as well as a book on physics.

Upon graduation from MIT with a PhD in pure mathematics, Frank Wang was asked by Saxon to run the day-to-day operations of the company. Wang started as a 16-year-old helper to him. A picture showing Saxon and Wang at John Saxon&#x27;s dining room table in the early years of the company appeared in a half-page story in the Washington Post on Tuesday, 19 June 2001 (p. A9) authored by Jay Mathews titled &quot;Not on the Same Page - Some Educations Say Saxon Math Books are Great Teaching Tools, but Many Systems Refuse to Use Them.&quot; Wang became the company&#x27;s president in 1994.

Saxon died on October 17, 1996. The company that he founded was owned by his four children and celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 2001 at a gala at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum. Frank Wang stepped down as CEO later in 2001 but retained the title of chairman, later leaving the company completely at the beginning of 2003. The company that Saxon founded was sold by his children to Reed Elsevier in mid-2004. It is currently owned by Boston-based company Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

== Usage today ==
His books have gained popularity among groups of homeschoolers and some private schools, but are also used in a number of public schools who favor a &quot;back to basics&quot; approach to mathematics. The group Citizens for the Constructive Review of Public Policy specifically mentions Saxon math and textbooks in their original 1990 statement of principles. William F. Buckley also commented on this in a 1981 issue of &quot;National Review&quot;.

== Honors ==
Saxon&#x27;s son, physician Dr. John H. Saxon III, initiated the John H. Saxon Service Academy Summer Research Program at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in 2009 with a grant of $250,000. As a board member, Dr. Saxon wished to honor both his father&#x27;s academy experience and military career, as well as serve the research facility. Students from the U.S. military academies are chosen to come to the foundation in the summer to work with senior scientists. The program allows the students an opportunity for knowledge acquisition and to prepare those who go on to serve as medical officers or in similar scientific pursuits.

<doc id="948164" wikidata="Q2976186" url="?curid=948164" title="Hyrum Smith">
<text>Hyrum Smith (February 9, 1800 – June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the original church of the Latter Day Saint movement. He was the older brother of the movement&#x27;s founder, Joseph Smith, and was killed with his brother at Carthage Jail where they were being held awaiting trial.

==Early life==

Hyrum Smith was born in Tunbridge, Vermont, the second son of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith.

Between the ages of 12 and 15, Smith briefly attended Moor&#x27;s Charity School on the campus of Dartmouth College while his family lived in nearby Lebanon, New Hampshire.

==Church service==
Smith was a close advisor and confidant to his brother Joseph as the latter produced the Book of Mormon and established the Church of Christ. In June 1829, Smith was baptized in Seneca Lake, New York. He was one of the Eight Witnesses who swore to the reality of a set of golden plates inscribed with the Book of Mormon. He also said he saw the angel Moroni. When the Church of Christ was organized on April 6, 1830, six men signed their names as charter members; at the age of 30, Hyrum Smith was the oldest of the six. Smith served as presiding officer of a church branch in Colesville, New York, and was one of the first Latter Day Saint missionaries in the surrounding area.

As the church headquarters and membership moved west, Smith and his family relocated. In 1831, he established a home in Kirtland, Ohio. During his residence there, he served as foreman of the quarry providing stone for the Kirtland Temple. Between 1831 and 1833, he served proselyting missions to Missouri and Ohio. In 1834, under the direction of Joseph Smith, he recruited members for a militia, Zion&#x27;s Camp, and traveled with the group to the aid of the Latter Day Saints in Missouri. He was appointed Second Counselor in the church&#x27;s First Presidency in November 1837. In 1838 and 1839, Hyrum, Joseph and three other church leaders shared a jail cell in Liberty, Missouri, while awaiting trial.

After relocating to Nauvoo, Illinois, Smith became the church&#x27;s Presiding Patriarch, a position first held by his father, Joseph Smith Sr. He also replaced Oliver Cowdery as Assistant President of the Church; in this capacity, Smith acted as President of the Church in Joseph&#x27;s absence and was designated to be Joseph&#x27;s successor if he were killed or incapacitated. Although Hyrum Smith was never explicitly ordained to the priesthood office of apostle, &quot;his appointment as assistant president may have included such authority&quot;.
When warned of possible danger, Joseph urged Hyrum Smith and his family to flee to Cincinnati, Ohio. Hyrum refused and, in 1844, traveled with Joseph to Carthage, Illinois, where both were charged with riot and treason. Joseph, Hyrum, John Taylor and Willard Richards were held awaiting trial in a jail in Carthage. On June 27, 1844, the building was attacked by a mob of between sixty and two hundred men. While attempting to barricade the door to prevent the mob from entering, Hyrum was shot in the face on the left side of the nose. After staggering back, another ball fired through the window struck him in the back, passed through his body, and struck his watch in his vest pocket. As Hyrum Smith fell to the floor, he exclaimed, &quot;I am a dead man,&quot; as he died. Taylor was struck by several bullets but survived with the help of Richards. Joseph was hit by at least two shots, exclaimed &quot;O Lord, My God,&quot; and fell through a second-story window to the ground where he was shot again.

Because of his position as Assistant President of the Church, it is likely that Smith would have succeeded Joseph and become the next president of the church had he outlived his brother.

==Political involvement==
Smith was a member of the Nauvoo City Council. At the time of his death, Smith was an independent candidate for the Illinois state legislature.

==Wives and children==

On 2 November 1826, in Manchester, New York, he married Jerusha Barden (1805–1837). They had six children together.
*Lovina Smith (16 September 1827 – 8 October 1876), who married Lorin Walker
*Mary Smith (27 June 1829 – 29 May 1832)
*John Smith (22 September 1832 – 6 November 1911)
*Hyrum Smith (27 April 1834 – 21 September 1841)
*Jerusha Smith (13 January 1836 – 27 June 1912)
*Sarah Smith (2 October 1837 – 6 November 1876), who married Charles Emerson Griffin

On 24 December 1837, in Kirtland, Ohio, he married Mary Fielding Smith (1801–1852). They had two children.
*Joseph F. Smith (13 November 1838 – 19 November 1918)
*Martha Ann Smith (14 May 1841 – 19 October 1923)

In August 1843, he married and was sealed to two plural wives: Mercy Fielding Thompson, widow of Robert B. Thompson and sister to Hyrum&#x27;s wife Mary; and Catherine Phillips.

== Descendants ==
Smith&#x27;s descendants have played significant roles in the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Joseph F. Smith, his son by Mary Fielding Smith, served as LDS Church president from 1901 to 1918. His grandson, Joseph Fielding Smith also served as president of the church from 1970 to 1972. His eldest son, John Smith, served as the church&#x27;s Presiding Patriarch from 1855 to 1911. John Smith&#x27;s descendants held this post from 1912 to 1932 and from 1942 to 1979, when the office was effectively discontinued and the incumbent, Eldred G. Smith, was given the title patriarch emeritus. M. Russell Ballard, who was the Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church, was also a direct descendant of Smith.

In 1918, Smith&#x27;s descendants erected a monument to him in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

In 2000, it was estimated that Smith had over 31,000 living descendants.

<doc id="948168" wikidata="Q49902" url="?curid=948168" title="Emily Warren Roebling">
<text>Emily Warren Roebling (September 23, 1843 – February 28, 1903) was an engineer known for her contributions over a period of more than 10 years to the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge after her husband Washington Roebling developed caisson disease (a.k.a. decompression disease) and became bedridden. She served as a liaison and supervisor of construction through communicating between her husband and on-site personnel. Her husband was the chief engineer during construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, which had been designed by his late father, John A. Roebling.

==Early life==
Emily was born on September 23, 1843, to Sylvanus and Phebe Warren at Cold Spring, New York. She was the second-youngest of twelve children. Emily&#x27;s interest in pursuing education was supported by her older brother Major General Gouverneur K. Warren. The two siblings always had a close relationship. She attended school at the Georgetown Visitation Academy in Washington, DC, now known as Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School.

In 1864, during the American Civil War, Emily visited her brother Gouverneur at his headquarters; Warren was commanding the Fifth Army Corps. At a soldiers&#x27; ball she attended during the visit, she became acquainted with Washington Roebling, a son of Brooklyn Bridge designer John A. Roebling. Washington was also a civil engineer and was serving on her brother Gouverneur Warren&#x27;s staff.

On January 18, 1865, Emily and Washington married in Cold Spring, in a dual wedding ceremony with another of her Warren siblings and spouse.

While John Roebling was starting his preliminary work on the Brooklyn Bridge, the newlyweds went to Europe to study the use of caissons for constructing the bridge. In November 1867, Emily gave birth in Germany to the couple&#x27;s only child, John A. Roebling II.

==Brooklyn Bridge==
On their return from their European studies, Washington&#x27;s father died in 1869 of tetanus, following an accident at the bridge site. Washington Roebling was assigned as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s construction. As he immersed himself in the project, Washington developed decompression sickness, which was known at the time as &quot;caisson disease&quot;, by going to underwater depths to study the placement of caissons and not rising at the proper speed. It affected him so severely that he became bed-ridden.

As the only person to visit her husband during his sickness, Emily Roebling relayed information from Washington to his assistants and reported to him the progress of work on the bridge. She developed an extensive knowledge of strength of materials, stress analysis, cable construction, and calculating catenary curves through Washington&#x27;s teachings. She complemented her knowledge by her prior interest in and study of the bridge&#x27;s construction when her husband had been appointed as chief engineer.

For the decade after Washington was confined to his sick bed, Roebling was dedicated to the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge. She took over much of the chief engineer duties, including day-to-day supervision and project management. Emily and her husband jointly planned the bridge&#x27;s continued construction. She dealt with politicians, competing engineers, and all those associated with work on the bridge, to the point where people believed she was behind the bridge&#x27;s design.

In 1882, Washington&#x27;s title of chief engineer was in jeopardy because of his extended illness. To allow him to retain his position, Roebling lobbied for him in meetings with engineers and politicians to defend her husband&#x27;s work. To the Roeblings&#x27; relief, the politicians responded well and permitted Washington to remain chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge.

The Brooklyn Bridge was completed in 1883. In advance of the official opening, carrying a rooster as a sign of victory, Emily Roebling was the first to cross the bridge by carriage. At the opening ceremony, Roebling was honored in a speech by Abram Stevens Hewitt, who said that the bridge was

==Later life==
Upon completion of her work on the Brooklyn Bridge, Roebling shifted to supporting several women&#x27;s causes, including the Committee on Statistics of New Jersey&#x27;s Board of Lady Managers for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Committee of Sorosis; Daughters of the American Revolution, George Washington Memorial Association, both of which worked on historical issues for the US; and Evelyn College. This followed after the Roebling family moved to Trenton, New Jersey, the capital of the state and a center of activities.

Roebling also participated in social organizations such as the Relief Society during the Spanish–American War. She traveled widely—in 1896 she was presented to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, and she was in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire, for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II. She also continued her education and received a law certificate from New York University.

Roebling is known for her influential essay, &quot;A Wife&#x27;s Disabilities&quot; (1899), published in the &quot;Albany Law Journal&quot;, which won wide acclaim and awards. In it, she argued for greater women&#x27;s rights and railed against discriminatory practices targeted at women. She signed the essay with her husband&#x27;s initials, W.A.R. 

Until her death on February 28, 1903, from stomach cancer, Roebling spent her remaining time with her family and kept socially and mentally active.

==Tributes==
Today the Brooklyn Bridge is marked with a plaque dedicated to the memory of Emily Warren Roebling, her husband Washington Roebling, and her father-in-law John A. Roebling.

In 2018 &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for Roebling, part of a series of obituaries for women and minorities whose achievements had been overlooked at their deaths.

Roebling&#x27;s role in the successful completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, and her status as a woman in the United States during the late-nineteenth century, is highlighted in season two of the HBO period drama &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;. Roebling&#x27;s character, portrayed by Liz Wisan, is recognized for her efforts at the bridge&#x27;s opening festivities.

In May 2024, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, her husband and son&#x27;s Alma Mater, honored Roebling with a posthumous honorary doctorate as part of its bicentenial commencement. The degree was accepted in character by Wisan, with a speech generated by feeding quotes from Roebling into GPT-4.

<text>Pêro da Covilhã (; c. 1460 – after 1526), sometimes written Pero de Covilhã, was a Portuguese diplomat and explorer.

He was a native of Covilhã in Beira. In his early life he had gone to Castile and entered the service of Don Juan de Guzmán, brother of Enrique de Guzmán, 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia. Later, when war broke out between Castile and Portugal, he returned to his own country, and attached himself, first as a groom, then as a squire, to Afonso V of Portugal and his successor John II of Portugal. In 1487, his overland expedition made its way to India, exploring trade opportunities with the Indians and Arabs, and winding up finally in Ethiopia. His detailed report was eagerly read in Lisbon, as Portugal became the world&#x27;s best informed center for global geography and trade routes.

== Mission to the East ==

Covilhã was an adventurer of low birth but an adept swordsman and loyal servant to the Portuguese Crown. His fluency in Arabic and Castilian allowed him to perform undercover operations in Spain as well as undertaking secret negotiations in Morocco on behalf of King John II of Portugal. These successful exploits prodded the King to send him and Afonso de Paiva to undertake a mission of exploration in the Near East and the adjoining regions of Asia and Africa, with the special assignment to learn where cinnamon and other spices could be found, as well as of discovering the land of legendary Prester John, by overland routes. Bartolomeu Dias, at the same time, went out to by sea find the Prester&#x27;s country, as well as the termination of the African continent and the ocean route to India.

The expedition started at Santarém, on May 7, 1487. Covilhã and Paiva were briefed by the Bishop of Tangiers and two Jewish mathematicians, Rodrigo and Moisés, who were prominent members of the commission which advised the Portuguese government to reject the proposals of Christopher Columbus. The explorers were presented with a &quot;letter of credence for all the countries of the world&quot; and a navigational map of the Middle East and Indian Ocean, likely drawn from the cartographical work of Fra Mauro. From Santarém they travelled by Barcelona to Naples, where their bills of exchange were paid by the sons of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. Next, they went to Rhodes and acquired a stock of honey so they could portray themselves as merchants while traveling in the Arab world. Afterwards, they sailed to Alexandria.

Following a fever that struck both men, the two explorers took a boat up the Nile to Cairo and later a caravan across the desert to the ports of El-Tor and Suakin. They sailed across the Red Sea to Aden where, as it was now the monsoon, they parted. Covilhã proceeded to India and Paiva to Ethiopia. They agreed to meet again in Cairo at a later date.

Covilhã caught a trading dhow across the Indian Ocean to Calicut, the hub of the spice trade. By 1488, he was in Goa and later sailed north to Ormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, another hub of the Indian Ocean. This reconnaissance allowed Covilhã to collect and record information about sailing routes, winds, currents, ports and politics. From Ormuz, he sailed down the east coast of Africa and eventually to Sofala, the farthest point of Arab navigation in the southern Indian Ocean. At Sofala, Covilhã investigated the feasibility of rounding Africa by sea and how best to navigate its east coast. By 1491, he had returned to Cairo, having successfully scouted the major trade routes of the Indian Ocean.

Back in Cairo he learnt that Paiva had died, somewhere on the way to Ethiopia. Meanwhile, King John II of Portugal had sent two Portuguese Jews: Rabbi Abraham of Beja and José Sapateiro, a shoe-maker of Lamego with letters for Covilhã and Paiva outlining further instructions. The King ordered that both men return to Lisbon but not before that &quot;had seen and found out about the great King Prester John&quot;. Through José Sapateiro, Covilhã replied with an account of his Indian and African journeys, and of his observations on the cinnamon, black pepper and clove trade at Calicut, together with advice as to the ocean way to India. He recommended that the Portuguese should sail south along the coast of Africa and the seas of Guinea. The first objective in the eastern ocean, he added, was Madagascar; from this island one could reach Calicut.

==Ethiopia==
With this information José returned to Portugal, while Covilhã, with Abraham of Beja, again visited Aden and Ormuz. At the latter he left the rabbi; and visited Jeddah, the principal port of Arabia, and penetrated (as he told Francisco Álvares many years later) even to Mecca and Medina. Finally, via Mount Sinai, El-Tor and across the Red Sea, he reached Zeila, where he struck inland to the court of Prester John (Ethiopia).

Here he was honorably received by the Emperor Eskender; lands and lordships were bestowed upon him, but Eskender refused to grant him permission to leave, and his successors evaded granting Covilhã permission. According to James Bruce, Covilhã maintained a correspondence with the king in Portugal, describing Ethiopia as &quot;very populous, full of cities both powerful and rich&quot;.

In 1507, he was joined by João Gomes, a priest sent by Tristão da Cunha, who had reached Ethiopia by way of Socotra. When the Portuguese embassy under Rodrigo de Lima, which included Ethiopian ambassador Mateus and missionary Francisco Álvares, entered Ethiopia in 1520, Covilhã wept with joy at the sight of his fellow-countrymen. It was then forty years since he had left Portugal and over thirty since he had been a prisoner of state in Ethiopia. Álvares, who professed to know him well, and to have heard the story of his life, both in confession and out of it, praises his power of vivid description as if things were present before him, and his extraordinary knowledge of all the spoken languages of Christians, Muslims and Gentiles. His services as an interpreter were valuable to Rodrigo de Lima&#x27;s embassy.
Covilhã was well treated but was not allowed to leave the country for the rest of his life.

== Legacy ==
Covilhã&#x27;s extensive travels in the medieval world saw him visit the modern day states of Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, India, Mozambique, Iran, Eritrea and Ethiopia.
These journeys, together with the maritime achievements of Bartolomeu Dias, were instrumental in paving the way for subsequent Portuguese expeditions, most significantly the Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India by Vasco da Gama in 1497.

Covilhã&#x27;s arrival in Ethiopia also marked the beginning of Portuguese-Ethiopian relations which culminated in the formal invitation for the Portuguese to interfere directly in the affairs of Abyssinia in the Ethiopian–Adal War of 1541. The sustained Portuguese presence in Ethiopia also led to the influx of Jesuit missionaries into the country although their success at converting the population to Catholicism was mixed. From their base in the city of Fremona, the Jesuits were able to convert the Ethiopian Emperors Za Dengel and Susenyos I to the faith in the 17th century but this resulted in a series of devastating rebellions and revolts against Catholic rule. Following the abdication of Susenyos I in favor of his son Fasilides in 1631, the Jesuits were expelled from the country resulting in several centuries of little to no contact between Ethiopia and Europe.

<doc id="948172" wikidata="Q916536" url="?curid=948172" title="La Ceiba">
<text>La Ceiba () is a municipality, the capital of the Honduran department of Atlántida and a port city on the northern coast of the Caribbean Sea in Honduras. It forms part of the south eastern boundary of the Gulf of Honduras. With an estimated population of 209,000 living in approximately 170 residential areas (called &quot;colonias&quot; or &quot;barrios&quot;), it is the fourth most populous and third most important city in the country. It was also one of several important ports during colonial times for exporting goods like sugar and gold to Spain and importing enslaved Africans to Honduras.

La Ceiba was officially founded on 23 August 1877. The city was named after a giant ceiba tree that grew near the old dock. The city has been officially proclaimed the &quot;Eco-Tourism Capital of Honduras,&quot; as well as the &quot;Entertainment Capital of Honduras&quot;. Every year, on the third or fourth Saturday of May, the city holds its famous carnival to commemorate Isidore the Laborer (Spanish &quot;San Isidro Labrador&quot;). During this time, the city is host to approximately 500,000 tourists.

== History ==

In 1872 Manuel Hernández built a small shack under the Ceiba tree that grew near the old docks. Over time, more and more people from present-day Honduras (especially the departments of Olancho and Santa Barbara), and from around the world settled in La Ceiba. Workers were attracted to jobs associated with the banana industry, which became important to the regional economy.

In the late 19th century, the banana business caught the attention of big North American banana companies, such as the Vaccaro Brothers&#x27; Standard Fruit Company from New Orleans. This new economic activity attracted national and international immigrantworkers to La Ceiba. The current neighbourhood known as Barrio Inglés was the first recognised neighbourhood in the city. It was so named after the many English-speaking people living in the barrio. At that point the main thoroughfare of La Ceiba was present-day Avenida La Republica, where the train tracks were laid. The rail line was built by the Standard Fruit Company (now Standard Fruit de Honduras, a Dole subsidiary) for transport of its commodity to ships at the port from the banana plantations. This company was largely responsible for the early growth of the city.

La Ceiba was declared a municipality on 23 August 1877. At that time Marco Aurelio Soto was President of Honduras. La Ceiba was the centre of banana and pineapple business, the basis of its economy. Other companies developed in the city, such as:

* Cervecería Hondureña, the national brewing company and holder of the Coca-Cola licence in Honduras. Founded in 1918.
* Fábrica de Manteca y Jabón Atlántida, known as La Blanquita, at one point, this was the largest producer of consumer goods in Honduras; it is now defunct.
* Banco Atlántida, oldest Bank in the country, founded in 1913.
* Mazapan School, the first bilingual school of the nation, the oldest high school and second oldest elementary school in the city.
The first municipal building or city hall was located in the corner of 2da Calle and Avenida Atlántida, at the site of the present-day Ferretería Kawas warehouse. The building was made of wood and in 1903 it was burnt down due to vandalism. Some people wanted to destroy private property ownership records in La Ceiba. The municipal building was set on fire again on 7 March 1914 during more social unrest.

The Municipal Corporation moved the offices further south of the city. They were burned again during unrest in 1924. Soon after this, the office building was constructed at its current location, on land donated by Manuel Mejía.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
La Ceiba features a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;) bordering a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with substantial rainfall throughout the course of the year. Due to its northerly aspect, there is a peak between October and February when the trade winds are strongest and extreme orographic rainfalls occur. The average annual rainfall is about , making it one of the wettest cities in Central America, second only to Colón, Panama among urbanised areas with more than 100,000 people.
== Economy ==
Among Honduran cities, La Ceiba is the second most important port town after Puerto Cortés. Its economy is made up of mostly commerce and agriculture. Pineapple is the city&#x27;s major export. Its largest producer is the Standard Fruit Company, a subsidiary of the Dole Food Company, which operates throughout northern Honduras and is based in La Ceiba.

Tourism also plays a large role in the city&#x27;s economy (see below). Since its development in the late 20th century, the La Ceiba seaport has played an ever-increasing role in the economy of the city. This port represents a vital economic artery to La Ceiba&#x27;s growing tourist industry. Additionally, the La Ceiba sea port is home to one of the finest boatyards in the north west Caribbean (According to &quot;Western Caribbean Cruising Guidebook&quot;). Known as the La Ceiba Shipyard, this company offers a complete group of marine services for all types of seagoing vessels.

== Education ==
La Ceiba is home to many public schools. Among the largest is Escuela Francisco Morazán along Avenida San Isidro, which is considered the main street of the city. Instituto Manuel Bonilla is the largest public High School in the city, with over 5,000 registered students.

There are also many private schools in La Ceiba. Several private bilingual education schools offer instruction in both Spanish and English. Most of these offer a Honduran Bachillerato Diploma (equivalent of High school diploma), while Mazapan School offers a US-accredited High School diploma as well. These schools usually offer grades 1 – 11/12, with some offering pre-school education.

The first university in the city was the Centro Universitario Regional del Litoral Atlántico (often called CURLA). It is a Public university run by the larger Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Honduras (UNAH).

The first private university to open in the city was Universidad Tecnológica de Honduras(UTH), which opened in 1995. At the time the college offered only night classes, using the classrooms in a local private high school. In 2002 the college built its own campus. 2002 also marked the opening of the Universidad Católica de Honduras, run by the Catholic church. Additionally, development of a new campus in La Ceiba for the Universidad Tecnológica Centroamericana – UNITEC was begun in 2008.

== Tourism ==
La Ceiba has long been known as the tourism capital of Honduras, due to its proximity to the beach, active night life, and a variety of parks and recreational areas in and around the city. Another factor contributing to the city&#x27;s tourism is the city port. It provides ferry services to the Bay Islands/Islas de la Bahia in the Caribbean. Ferries from this port also offer daily service to the main islands of Útila and Roatán.

The area around La Ceiba has many parks and natural reserves. Its most recognised natural area is the Pico Bonito (Beautiful Peak) National park. This park&#x27;s most recognised feature, Pico Bonito on the Nombre de Dios mountain range, is 2435 meters high and provides a back drop for the city. The Cangrejal River, popular for its Class III-IV river rafting, borders the eastern edge of the city and the Cuero and Salado Wildlife refuges with its wild manatees is located a few miles to the west of the city.

Semana Santa (Holy Week) is one of the city&#x27;s busiest tourist seasons. During this week tourists from all over the country flock to the city to enjoy its sun, beach, and very active night life during that week during Carnaval before Ash Wednesday.

The busiest tourist season by far is the week leading up to the internationally renowned &quot;Gran Carnaval Internacional de La Ceiba&quot; which is a citywide celebration in honour of the city&#x27;s patron saint, St. Isidore (San Isidro). During the week leading up to the third Saturday in May, many neighborhoods have smaller celebrations in one or a couple of their streets. On Saturday afternoon the big parade with elaborate floats takes place along Avenida San Isidro, the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare. After the parade, the locals and tourists all have a celebration along that same road, where stands sell food, beer, drinks, and souvenirs.

== Transportation ==

There were trains running through La Ceiba to bring the bananas from the plantations but they are not active any longer although traces of the old railroad tracks can still be seen. 

Buses and taxis make up most of the public transportation in the city, with numerous buses serving almost every available route in the city. Taxi-cabs are numerous in the city, costing as little as L.30.00 (just over $1.20 as of 2023) for destinations within sectors of the city limits. From one sector to the next, the cost is an additional 10 Lempira ($.40)

The pier to the east of the city offers transportation via ferry to 2 of the 3 major islands that make up Islas de la Bahia; Roatan and Utila. The Golosón International Airport to the west of town offers flights to the other major cities in the country as well as other towns in the Mosquitia Region of Honduras in the east. This airport is hub to Aerolíneas Sosa. There is also a bus station just west of the city centre though some buses also run from their own terminals.

== Sport ==
La Ceiba is the home of two clubs of the top division of the Honduran National Professional Football League, Vida and Victoria. Both play in Nilmo Edwards Stadium. The matches between the two rival clubs are known as &quot;Clásico Ceibeño&quot;.

<doc id="948181" wikidata="Q6703534" url="?curid=948181" title="Luna Lounge">
<text>Luna Lounge was a bar and music club located at 171 Ludlow Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. Opened in 1995 by Dianne Galliano and Robert Sacher, it was a popular venue for local bands and stand-up comics (the rock band Interpol played there early on and last returned in 2003 to perform a secret show under the name &quot;Cuddleworthy&quot;). Luna Lounge is notable as the place where Elliott Smith wrote the songs for his first major label release, &quot;XO&quot;.

The performance room hosted two to four bands six nights a week, with the &quot;Eating It&quot; alternative stand-up comedy show filling the room on Mondays. &quot;Eating It&quot; featured a changing line-up of comedians including Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, Louis C.K., Jim Norton, Ted Alexandro, Todd Barry, H. Jon Benjamin, Greg Giraldo, Marc Maron, Mitch Hedberg, Patrice O&#x27;Neal, Kathy Griffin, Dennis Miller, Patton Oswalt, Sarah Vowell, Mike Birbiglia, Dave Chappelle and Roseanne Barr; performance artists such as Reverend Jen, Michael Portnoy and Tammy Faye Starlite; and dozens of others. The weekly event was initially devised by Garofalo and Maron, who later helped create the radio network Air America Radio. The $8 admission fee included a drink. Footage of the bar can be seen in the 1997 independent comedy movie &quot;Who&#x27;s the Caboose?&quot;, which starred Silverman. 

A much-loved foosball table was located by the entrance; a game cost $1 in quarters. 

Luna Lounge was forced to close when its landlord sold the small building to a buyer who planned to demolish it and build a larger development site. The bar closed its doors for the last time at its original location on the morning of June 12, 2005 and the building was torn down on July 26 and 27 of that year.

Music at Luna Lounge was always free. When the club closed, it was the last spot on the Lower East Side to feature nightly rock shows with no cover. Some other bands which played the venue early in their careers include The Strokes, Interpol, Longwave, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Ambulance LTD, Nada Surf, Ratatat, The National, Wheatus and Stellastarr. 

Sacher, without Galliano, opened a second Luna Lounge on January 22, 2007, in a new Williamsburg, Brooklyn space. Among the artists to play the reopened location were The Meat Puppets, Steve Forbert, The Knitters, The Pipettes, Longwave, Rob Dickinson, The Black Angels, Melvins, Bell Hollow and Kate Nash. Luna Lounge sold its Williamsburg lease in April 2008 to the Knitting Factory. 

Luna Lounge co-creator and co-owner Sacher later wrote an autobiography, &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot;, which mainly focused on Luna Lounge and its historic and cultural significance within the music scene in New York. The book was published by Selena Press on March 1, 2012.

<doc id="948183" wikidata="Q842917" url="?curid=948183" title="Outgroup (cladistics)">
<text>In cladistics or phylogenetics, an outgroup is a more distantly related group of organisms that serves as a reference group when determining the evolutionary relationships of the ingroup, the set of organisms under study, and is distinct from sociological outgroups. The outgroup is used as a point of comparison for the ingroup and specifically allows for the phylogeny to be rooted. Because the polarity (direction) of character change can be determined only on a rooted phylogeny, the choice of outgroup is essential for understanding the evolution of traits along a phylogeny.

== History ==
Although the concept of outgroups has been in use from the earliest days of cladistics, the term &quot;outgroup&quot; is thought to have been coined in the early 1970s at the American Museum of Natural History. Prior to the advent of the term, various other terms were used by evolutionary biologists, including &quot;exgroup&quot;, &quot;related group&quot;, and &quot;outside groups&quot;.

== Choice of outgroup ==
The chosen outgroup is hypothesized to be less closely related to the ingroup than the ingroup is related to itself. The evolutionary conclusion from these relationships is that the outgroup species has a common ancestor with the ingroup that is older than the common ancestor of the ingroup. Choice of outgroup can change the topology of a phylogeny. Therefore, phylogeneticists typically use more than one outgroup in cladistic analysis. The use of multiple outgroups is preferable because it provides a more robust phylogeny, buffering against poor outgroup candidates and testing the ingroup&#x27;s hypothesized monophyly.

To qualify as an outgroup, a taxon must satisfy the following two characteristics:

*It must not be a member of the ingroup.
*It must be related to the ingroup, closely enough for meaningful comparisons to the ingroup.

Therefore, an appropriate outgroup must be unambiguously outside the clade of interest in the phylogenetic study. An outgroup that is nested within the ingroup will, when used to root the phylogeny, result in incorrect conclusions about phylogenetic relationships and trait evolution. However, the optimal level of relatedness of the outgroup to the ingroup depends on the depth of phylogenetic analysis. Choosing a closely related outgroup relative to the ingroup is more useful when looking at subtle differences, while choosing an unduly distant outgroup can result in mistaking convergent evolution for a direct evolutionary relationship due to a common ancestor. For shallow phylogenetics—for example, resolving the evolutionary relationships of a clade within a genus—an appropriate outgroup would be a member of the sister clade. However, for deeper phylogenetic analysis, less closely related taxa can be used. For example, Jarvis et al. (2014) used humans and crocodiles as outgroups while resolving the early branches of the avian phylogeny. In molecular phylogenetics, satisfying the second requirement typically means that DNA or protein sequences from the outgroup can be successfully aligned to sequences from the ingroup. Although there are algorithmic approaches to identify the outgroups with maximum global parsimony, they are often limited by failing to reflect the continuous, quantitative nature of certain character states. Character states are traits, either ancestral or derived, that affect the construction of branching patterns in a phylogenetic tree.

== Examples ==

In each example, a phylogeny of organisms in the ingroup may be rooted by scoring the same character states for one or more members of the outgroup.

<text>A winged unicorn (cerapter, flying unicorn, unisus, or unipeg) is a fictional ungulate, typically portrayed as a horse, with wings like a pegasus and the horn of a unicorn. In some literature and media, it has been referred to as an alicorn, a word derived from the Italian word , or as a pegacorn, a portmanteau of pegasus and unicorn.

==Description==
Winged unicorns have been depicted in art. Ancient Achaemenid Assyrian seals depict winged unicorns and winged bulls as representing evil, but winged unicorns can also represent light.

Irish poet W. B. Yeats wrote of imagining a winged beast that he associated with ecstatic destruction. The beast took the form of a winged unicorn in his 1907 play &quot;The Unicorn from the Stars&quot; and later that of the rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem in his poem &quot;The Second Coming&quot;.


==Other representations in media==

*In &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, the titular character rides an alicorn named Swift Wind.
*In &quot;Sailor Moon SuperS&quot;, a man named Helios, the Guardian Priest (the high priest and guardian) of Elysion who guard the Golden Crystal, took the form of a pegasus, which is depicted as in such form, having both a golden horn and wings, as he hid from the Dead Moon Circus after having been imprisoned by Queen Nehelenia.
*The PBS Kids series &quot;Arthur&quot; features one of DW&#x27;s toys, a blue fluffy unicorn from the fictional company &quot;My Fluffy Unicorn&quot; with white feathered wings and stars on her hips.
*In the 2010 incarnation of My Little Pony toyline and its &quot;Friendship Is Magic&quot; television series, winged unicorns have made several appearances, including Princess Celestia and her younger sister Luna who formerly ruled Canterlot, then Princess Cadance, the ruler of the Crystal Empire and her daughter Flurry Heart, and her sister-in-law Twilight Sparkle, who formerly lived in Ponyville and later lives in Canterlot as the ruler of Equestria as of the series finale.
*In 2021 film &quot;My Little Pony: A New Generation&quot;, Sunny Starscout was originally an earth pony until the end where she gained translucent wings and a horn. The 2021 soft reboot of the My Little Pony franchise, in which &quot;A New Generation&quot; is a part of, further explores the idea, as the evil pony Opaline has tangible wings and a horn. Additionally, &quot;Friendship Is Magic&quot; winged unicorns return in &quot;Make Your Mark&quot;.
*In &quot;Sofia the First&quot;, the Mystic Isles episodes, one of the isles is called the Isle of Unicorns, where the winged unicorns reside, and in episode 29 of the 4th season &quot;Forever Royal, Part 2&quot;, Sofia uses the amulet of Avalor to change her into a winged unicorn.
*The first &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; game has two pegacorn statues on the big balcony.
*Webkinz has two pets called the Celestial Unicorn, a winged unicorn that is colored purple and cyan, and the Quirky Carnival Unicorn, a dark purple and mint green one.
*The &quot;Skandar&quot; book series by A. F. Steadman feature winged unicorns that reside on an island between Britain and Ireland known simply as The Island. These unicorns hatch from eggs that appear in The Island&#x27;s hatchery on the same day their destined riders are born and hatch when the riders turn thirteen. In order to find which of the Hatchery&#x27;s eggs contains their destined unicorn, riders must place their right hand onto an egg. If the rider finds the correct egg, the unicorn inside will start to hatch from it and their horn will pierce their rider&#x27;s palm, leaving a wound on it called a Hatchery wound. This procedure causes the unicorn to transfer some of its magic into their rider, allowing them to use magic connected to the elements of Fire, Earth, Air, Water and Spirit. Afterwards, the unicorn and their rider train at a school on The Island called The Eyrie for five years, where they are taught how to perform elemental magic (with their assigned element being their strongest). Eyrie students in their fourth and fifth year along with older riders participate in the Chaos Cup, an event where twenty five unicorns and their riders race whilst using elemental magic against their opponents. The winning rider earns the title of Commodore of Chaos, which involves them taking charge of The Island. The rider holds onto the title for a year unless they continue to win future Chaos Cups. It is known that the life of a bonded unicorn is connected to their rider, meaning that if the rider were to die, the unicorn would die too, though if the unicorn died first, their rider would survive. It is also known that unicorns that hatch and do not have a rider to bound with will become wild and ferocious. Wild unicorns are also immortal (but can be killed by those allied to the Spirit element) and have a decayed appearance. The series&#x27; protagonist Skandar Smith owns a unicorn called Scoundrel&#x27;s Luck.

<text>The Novgorod Slavs, Ilmen Slavs (, &quot;Il&#x27;menskiye slovene&quot;), or Slovenes (not to be confused with the South Slavic Slovenes) were the northernmost tribe of the Early Slavs, and inhabited the shores of Lake Ilmen, and the river basins of the Volkhov, Lovat, Msta, and the upper stream of the Mologa in the 8th to 10th centuries. The Slovenes were native to the region around Novgorod. There is a belief among researchers that Novgorod is one of the regions which were the original home / Urheimat of the Russians and the Slavic tribes.

Like all Eastern Slavs in Russian lands, the Ilmen Slavs had unique characteristics. Ancestors of the Ilmen Slavs who settled in Finnic areas descended from the Severians and the Polabian Slavs, as evidenced by language and traditions (see old Novgorod dialect and Gostomysl for examples). They settled in mostly Finnic areas in Northern Russia, moving along the major waterways, until they met the southward expansion of the Krivich in the modern-day Yaroslavl Oblast.

They left a few archaeological monuments of the 6th–8th centuries, such as agricultural settlements, and tall cone-like kurgans with cremated bodies in the Ladoga region. The most ancient settlement is dated to the 7th or 8th centuries. Numerous archaeological finds, such as a metal tip for a wooden plough, indicate that the Ilmen Slavs had a well-developed agriculture. 

They were not a particularly warlike state, but evidence of their unique weaponry, dating back to the mid-8th century, has been found around the city of Novgorod. The weaponry consisted of spears, maces, swords, bows, javelins, and war hammers.

The principal cities of the Ilmen Slavs were Staraya Russa and Novgorod, the center of the Novgorod Republic, which had developed in the 9th–10th centuries.

<text>The Silent Unseen (Polish: &quot;Cichociemni&quot;, ) were elite special-operations paratroopers of the Polish Army in exile, created in Great Britain during World War II to operate in occupied Poland (&quot;Cichociemni Spadochroniarze Armii Krajowej&quot;).

A total of 2,613 Polish Army soldiers volunteered for training by Polish and British SOE operatives. 
Only 606 people completed the training, and eventually 316 of them were secretly parachuted into occupied Poland. 
The first operation (&quot;air bridge&quot;, as it was called) took place on 15 February 1941. This operation was conducted by Captain Józef Zabielski, Major Stanisław Krzymowski and political courier Czesław Raczkowski. 
After 27 December 1944 further operations were discontinued, as by then most of Poland had been occupied by the Red Army.

Of 316 Cichociemni, 103 perished during the war: in combat with the Germans, executed by the Gestapo, or in crashes. A further nine were executed after the war by the Polish People&#x27;s Republic; the communist regime was hostile to the Cichociemni, considered to be British ideologised infiltrators. Ninety-one &quot;Cichociemni&quot; operatives took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.

==Name==
The origins of the name are obscure and may never be known with certainty. &quot;Silent Unseen&quot; probably related to how some soldiers seemingly disappeared from their line units overnight to volunteer for special operations service, and it also describes those &quot;who appear silently where they are least expected, play havoc with the enemy and disappear whence they came, unnoticed, unseen.&quot;

The Silent Unseen were trained initially in Scotland in preparation for missions for the Polish underground in occupied Poland, such as building-clearance and bridge-demolition. In 1944, training was also carried out in Brindisi, Italy, which had fallen to the Allies.

Initially, the name was informal and was used mainly by soldiers who volunteered to parachute into Poland. However, from September 1941 the name became official and was used in all documents. It was applied to the secret Polish Headquarters training unit created to provide agents with necessary knowledge, money and equipment and to agents who were transported to Poland and other German-occupied countries.

==History==
On 30 December 1939 Captain Jan Górski, a Polish Army officer who had escaped to France after the invasion of Poland, drew up a report for the Polish Chief of Staff. Górski proposed creating a secret unit to maintain contact with the underground &quot;ZWZ&quot;, using a group of well-trained envoys. After his report was ignored, Górski resubmitted it several times. Finally the commander of the Polish Air Force, General Zając, replied that, while creation of such a unit would be a good move, the Polish Air Force had no means of transport and no training facilities for such a unit.

Górski and his colleague Maciej Kalenkiewicz continued studying the possibility of paratroops and special forces. After the capitulation of France, they managed to reach the United Kingdom. They studied documents on German paratroops and drafted a plan to create in exile a Polish airborne force to be used in covert support operations. The force was to be employed solely in aid of a future uprising in occupied Poland. Their plan was never adopted, but on 20 September 1940 the Polish commander-in-chief, General Władysław Sikorski, ordered the creation of Section III of the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff (&quot;Oddział III Sztabu Naczelnego Wodza&quot;). Section III&#x27;s purpose was contingency planning for covert operations in Poland, air delivery of arms and supplies, and training of paratroops.

===Training===
Soon after, the General Staff&#x27;s Section III began recruiting volunteers. Those selected left their erstwhile units in secret, silently and at night – hence, the perhaps at first facetious name, &quot;Cichociemni&quot; (&quot;Silent Unseen&quot;). Of 2,413 candidates, only 605 managed to complete the training and pass all the tests; of those, 579 qualified for airlift.

The volunteers included 1 general, 112 staff officers, 894 officers, 592 non-commissioned officers (NCOs), 771 privates, 15 women, and 28 civilian emissaries of the Polish Government in Exile. The training established by the General Staff&#x27;s Section VI (&quot;Oddział VI Sztabu Naczelnego Wodza&quot;) and the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) comprised five courses:
* workout course (&quot;kurs zaprawowy&quot;)
* psychological and technical investigations course (&quot;kurs badań psychotechnicznych&quot;)
* parachuting course (&quot;kurs spadochronowy&quot;)
* covert-operations course (&quot;kurs walki konspiracyjnej&quot;)
* briefing course (&quot;kurs odprawowy&quot;)

During the first phase of training, all the volunteers were taught to use every kind of weapon (British, Polish, German, Russian and Italian weapons) and mines. In additional courses, the soldiers were trained in basic covert operations, topography, cryptography, and sharpshooting. They were also taught details of life in occupied Poland, from German-imposed laws to current fashions in occupied Warsaw. The fourth course included all kinds of covert operations, jujitsu, and shooting at invisible targets. The briefing course included learning a new, false identity. All soldiers who passed the training were sworn in as members of the Home Army.

===Air bridges===

The first air-bridge operation took place on 15 February 1941. The Allied air commands carried out 483 air-bridge operations all together, losing 68 planes to crashes and enemy fire. Apart from the Silent Unseen themselves, some 630 tons of war materiel were delivered in special containers. In addition, agents delivered the following sums of money to the Home Army:
* 40,869,800 forged zlotys;
* US$26,299,375 in banknotes and gold;
* £1,755 in gold;
* RM 3,578,000.

Through 27 December 1944, 316 soldiers and 28 emissaries successfully parachuted into Poland. Additionally, 17 agents were dropped into Albania, France, Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia. An unknown number of Poles (including the best known, Krystyna Skarbek) were also parachuted into France by the British Special Operations Executive to start an underground movement among the half-million-strong Polish minority.

Though the Silent Unseen were organized in collaboration with SOE, it was largely independent. The Polish section of SOE was the only one which freely chose its own men and operated its own radio communications with an occupied country. Additionally, the identities of the Polish agents were known only to the Polish General Staff. Those transported to Poland included soldiers of all grades. The oldest was 54 years old, the youngest was 20. As a rule, all volunteers were promoted one rank at the moment of their jump.
===The fight===
In Poland the Silent Unseen were assigned mostly to special units of the &quot;ZWZ&quot; and Home Army. Most of them joined &quot;Wachlarz&quot;, &quot;Związek Odwetu&quot; and &quot;KeDyw&quot;. Many became important staff officers of the Polish Secret Army and took part in Operation Tempest and uprisings in Wilno, Lwów and Warsaw.

The Silent Unseen assumed various duties in German-occupied Europe. Some 37 worked in intelligence, 50 were radio operators and emissaries, 24 were staff officers, 22 were airmen and airdrop coordinators, 11 were instructors of armored forces and instructors in anti-tank warfare at secret military schools, 3 were trained in forging documents, 169 were trained in covert operations and partisan warfare, and 28 were emissaries of the Polish government.

==Famous Silent Unseen==
The most notable Silent Unseen included:
==Losses==
Of 344 men transported to Poland, 113 were killed in action:
* 84 in fighting against the Germans, or arrested and tortured to death by the Gestapo;
* 10 committed suicide in German prisons or concentration camps;
* 10 were executed by the Communists during or after the war;
* 9 were shot down with their planes before reaching their targets.

Of 91 Silent Unseen who took part in the Warsaw Uprising, 18 were killed in action.

==Postwar==
The first book on the Silent Unseen was published in England in 1954. The Polish edition, &quot;Drogi cichociemnych: opowiadania zebrane i opracowane przez koło spadochroniarzy Armii Krajowej&quot;, was published by Veritas; and an English edition, &quot;The Unseen and Silent: Adventures from the Underground Movement, Narrated by Paratroops of the Polish Home Army&quot;, was published by Sheed and Ward.

The Polish edition was republished in England several times, last in 1973. A miniature version of &quot;Drogi cichociemnych&quot; was published in two volumes in communist Poland in 1985 by &quot;Kurs&quot;.

General Stefan Bałuk&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Byłem Cichociemnym&quot; (&quot;I was a Cichociemny&quot;), was published in 2008. He was 94 years old when it first appeared in bookstores. In 2009 it was translated into English as &quot;Silent and Unseen: I was a WW II Special Ops Commando&quot;.

On 4 August 1995, the Polish special-forces unit &quot;GROM&quot; adopted the name and traditions of the &quot;Cichociemni&quot;.

Polish TV has produced a series, &quot;Czas honoru&quot; (Time of Honour), about the Silent Unseen.

An urban park commemorating the paratroopers, known as the Silent Unseen Park, was established in 2016 in Warsaw.
