<text>Kong Rong () (151/153 – 26 September 208), courtesy name Wenju, was a Chinese poet, politician, and minor warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was a 20th generation descendant of Confucius. As he was once the Chancellor of Beihai State, he was also known as Kong Beihai. He was defeated by Yuan Tan in 196 and escaped to the capital Xuchang. For being a political opponent of Cao Cao and humiliating him on multiple occasions, Kong Rong was eventually put to death on various charges.

Famed for his quick wits and elaborate literary style, Kong Rong was ranked among the Seven Scholars of Jian&#x27;an, a group of representative literati of his time. However, most of his works had been lost. Those that survived can be found in compilations from the Ming and Qing dynasties.

A well-known story commonly used to educate children – even in contemporary times – on the values of courtesy and fraternal love involves a four-year-old Kong Rong giving up the larger pears to his older and younger brothers. This story, commonly known as &quot;Kong Rong giving up pears&quot; (), is also mentioned in the &quot;Three Character Classic&quot;, a text used for elementary education since the Song dynasty.

==Early life and career==

Born in the former Lu state (present-day southern Shandong and northern parts of Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu), Kong Rong showed quick wit from a young age. His father was Kong Zhou. According to the &quot;Epilogue of Han&quot; () by Sima Biao (), when he was a teenager, Kong Rong paid a visit to an official named Li Ying, who received no one but the very eminent and his own relatives. Claiming to be a relative, Kong Rong was brought before Li Ying, who asked how they were related. Kong Rong answered that his ancestor Confucius was a student and friend of Lao Tzu (whose family name was said to be Li()). Another guest present was not impressed, however, commenting that a person who showed great ability at a young age might not grow up to be especially capable. Kong Rong immediately retorted, &quot;I suppose you were really smart when you were young.&quot; Li Ying laughed at this and predicted the child would grow up to be a great man.

When he grew older, Kong Rong entered the bureaucracy of the Eastern Han dynasty. He was successively promoted and in 190 was appointed Chancellor of Beihai State, situated in Qing Province, the area most heavily contested by the Yellow Turban rebels during the 180s. Upon taking up office, Kong Rong concentrated on reconstruction of the city and the establishment of schools. He promoted Confucian studies and provided proper burial for deceased refugees who had no family members to look after their funeral affairs. During this time, he was besieged by a remnant Yellow Turban army led by Guan Hai (). Kong Rong sent Taishi Ci to seek help from Liu Bei, then the Prefect of Pingyuan County. Taishi Ci returned with 3,000 elite troops, whereupon the rebels dispersed. In 195, through Liu Bei&#x27;s nomination, Kong Rong was further promoted to be the Inspector of Qing Province.

===Stay in Xuchang===
The next year, however, the warlord Yuan Shao sent his eldest son Yuan Tan to attack Qing Province. Kong Rong was defeated and his family was captured. He escaped to the capital Xuchang, where he was subsequently appointed Minister Steward (). During his stay in Xuchang, Kong Rong often opposed policies of the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled Emperor Xian and the Han central government. When Cao Cao imposed a ban on alcohol due to crop shortage, Kong Rong wrote to him saying, &quot;Since the kings Jie and Zhou (the last rulers of the Xia dynasty and Shang dynasty respectively) were overthrown due to their desire for women, why don&#x27;t you ban marriage as well?&quot; Kong Rong was then stripped of his official post but soon reinstated, albeit to a titular position. However, because of his hospitality, his house was always filled with guests.

During this time Kong Rong befriended Mi Heng of Jing Province (present-day Hubei and Hunan). Despite being very learned, Mi Heng was unconventional and unconstrained. Upon reaching Xuchang, he wrote a prose piece putting down every eminent person there. When asked whom he would consider talented, Mi Heng replied, &quot;First there is Kong Rong, second there is Yang Xiu.&quot; Kong Rong wanted to recommend Mi Heng to Cao Cao, but Mi put up a rude and arrogant attitude in front of Cao. First, he undressed while playing a drum at a feast hosted by Cao Cao, and criticized Cao loudly outside his doors. Cao Cao eventually sent Mi Heng to Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province.

In 198, Cao Cao was gearing up for an encounter with Yuan Shao along the shores of the Yellow River. Kong Rong held a pessimistic view, telling Cao Cao&#x27;s adviser Xun Yu that Yuan Shao would be extremely difficult to defeat as he had ample food supplies, far superior troop strength and many capable and loyal subjects. However, Cao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao&#x27;s weaknesses and eventually defeated him at the Battle of Guandu in 200. Yuan Shao died two years later, leaving his eldest and youngest sons, Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang, to contest his legacy.

In 204, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shang then conquered the city of Ye and massacred his population. The women of the Yuan household were often raped and his son Cao Pi married the wife of Yuan Xi, Lady Zhen. When Kong Rong heard of this, he wrote Cao Cao a letter, falsifying a parallel in ancient history, claiming King Wu of Zhou arranged marriage between his brother the Duke of Zhou and the beautiful consort Daji, lately the favourite of the defeated king Di Xin, and legendarily blamed for the downfall of the Shang dynasty. Thinking that Kong Rong was citing a classic text to praise him, Cao Cao asked about the source, but Kong merely said, &quot;I saw what happened in our day and thought it must have been so.&quot;

===Death===
In 208, Kong Rong spoke ill of Cao Cao before an emissary from Sun Quan, a warlord who ruled the territories in the Jiangdong region. Cao Cao then ordered Kong Rong to be executed on various charges including, among others, &quot;plotting a rebellion&quot;, &quot;slandering the imperial court&quot; and &quot;disrespecting court protocol&quot;. According to the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of Wei&quot; () by Sun Sheng (), Kong Rong&#x27;s two eight-year-old sons (a nine-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter according to the &quot;Book of Later Han&quot;) were playing a game of weiqi when their father was arrested. When others urged them to escape, they answered:

This later became a Chinese idiom (覆巢之下，安有完卵), used to describe that when a group suffers, all individuals belonging to it will be affected. An alternate but similar story could also be found in &quot;A New Account of the Tales of the World&quot; by Liu Yiqing (), which is written in a more elaborate style.

After Kong Rong was executed along with his entire family, his body was left in the streets. Not a single official who used to be close to him dared to collect the corpses for burial except Zhi Xi (), who came to Kong Rong&#x27;s body and cried, &quot;Now you have left me for death, whom could I talk to who would understand me?&quot;

==Literary achievements==
Although he did not meet with much success in politics, Kong Rong was considered a leading literary figure of his time, famed for his prose as well as poetry. Along with six other poets of his time, their poems formed the backbone of what was to be known as the Jian&#x27;an style, named for the Jian&#x27;an Era of the Xian Emperor&#x27;s rule between 196 and 220. Collectively they were known as the Seven Scholars of Jian&#x27;an. Civil strife towards the end of the Han dynasty gave the Jian&#x27;an poems their characteristic solemn yet heart-stirring tone, while lament over the ephemerality of life was also a central theme of works from this period. In the history of Chinese literature, the Jian&#x27;an poems were a transition between early folksongs and scholarly poetry.

Kong Rong&#x27;s literary skills, however, were often thought to be elaborate and empty show without sound content. Cao Pi commented in his &quot;A Discourse on Literature&quot; () that Kong Rong&#x27;s words cannot sustain discourse and surpassed reasoning, so much so that they almost seem like mere sarcasm or mockery.

After Kong Rong&#x27;s death, Cao Pi collected 25 of his poems and included them in &quot;A Discourse on Literature&quot;. However, most of these were lost and only five survive till this day, two of which are of unverified authenticity. Nine volumes containing Kong Rong&#x27;s prose under the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; () have also been lost. Those that survive are found in compilations from the Ming and Qing dynasties. These include several epistles that Kong Rong wrote to Cao Cao in criticism of his policies.

<text>The Manitoba Grey Party was a political party in Manitoba, Canada, focusing on senior&#x27;s issues. The party appears to have been founded in 2002, at the same time as the Grey Party of Canada and other provincial Grey Parties.

The national party was formed to address the health needs of seniors, and was particularly concerned with the high cost of prescription drugs. It also promoted a &quot;right-wing populist&quot; ideology on other issues, claiming that Canada&#x27;s legal profession held too much sway over government policy. It is likely that the provincial party advocated similar positions.

The Grey Party may have attempted to register with Elections Manitoba before the 2003 provincial election; if so, it was unsuccessful. The party does not appear to have sponsored any candidates in the election.

The Grey Party of Canada seems to have collapsed later in 2003, and it is not clear if the Manitoba organization still exists.

The Manitoba Grey Party&#x27;s first (and perhaps only) leader was Lou Hemming.

<text>Todd Norton Terry (born April 18, 1967) is an American DJ, record producer and remixer in the genre of house music. His productions helped define the New York house scene in the 1990s and used extensive samples that blend the sounds of classic disco, the Chicago house sound, and elements of hip-hop. He has remixed a wide variety of artists.

==Musical career==
Todd Terry was influential in moving house music beyond the early Chicago house sound of 1984–86. He crossed the sounds of house with hip hop breaks to create a more energized and popular sound that was able to reach commercial success outside the underground house scene. His productions extensively used samples that blend the sounds of classic disco, the Chicago house sound, and elements of hip-hop.

Terry began his career in the 1980s, DJing at parties in New York. At first, he played Italo disco and hip-hop. Later he concentrated on house music upon its mid-&#x27;80s emergence. He debuted as Masters at Work with the 12-inch &quot;Alright Alright&quot; (1987, Fourth Floor) and an edit from this was then included on the Chicago house vanguard compilation &quot;Jackmaster 1&quot; (1987, D.J. International/Westside UK).

Much of Terry&#x27;s early work in the late 1980s is considered a milestone in the development of house and rave music. He was responsible for releasing two of the house era&#x27;s most respected crossover remixes: &quot;I&#x27;ll House You&quot; by the Jungle Brothers (summer 1988) and &quot;Missing&quot; by Everything but the Girl as a re-release in October 1995. His music was a driving force within the &quot;acid house&quot; scene in the UK with many tracks such as &quot;Back to the Beat&quot;, &quot;Can You Party&quot;, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, &quot;Weekend&quot;, &quot;Party People&quot;, &quot;Yeah, Buddy&quot; and &quot;Dreams of Santa-Anna&quot;, released under multiple aliases including the Todd Terry Project, Royal House, Black Riot, Swan Lake and Orange Lemon. In the summer of 1988 at the peak of the UK acid house movement, &quot;Can You Party&quot; under his Royal House moniker reached No. 14 in the UK.

Terry&#x27;s notable releases during the 1990s include &quot;Something Goin&#x27; On&quot; and &quot;Keep on Jumpin&#x27;&quot;, which were UK top-ten hits, with the vocals on both provided by Jocelyn Brown and Martha Wash.

Freestyle artist Shannon was the featured vocalist on the UK top 20 hit &quot;It&#x27;s Over Love&quot; in 1997, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Play Songs chart in the US, as did &quot;Just Wanna Dance / Weekend&quot;. An album, &quot;Ready for a New Day&quot;, was also released in 1997, featuring &quot;Something Goin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;Keep on Jumpin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Over Love&quot;. It reached No. 84 on the UK Albums Chart.

In 1996, he remixed &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot; for Michael Jackson.

In 1999, inspired by the drum &amp; bass genre, Terry released &quot;Resolutions&quot; on Astralwerks Records. He also worked on the albums &quot;One Half of a Whole Decade&quot; and &quot;Live &amp; Remastered&quot;.

Throughout his career, Terry has used several aliases including Hard House, Swan Lake, Orange Lemon, Royal House, and Black Riot. As Black Riot, &quot;Warlock/A Day in the Life&quot; was released as a single on the Champion label and entered the UK Singles Chart on December 3, 1988, reaching a peak position of number 68. He also recorded under the monikers CLS, Masters at Work (with Kenny &quot;Dope&quot; Gonzalez and &quot;Little&quot; Louie Vega), Dredd Stock, House of Gypsies, Limelife, Tyme Forse, and the Gypsymen (scoring a number-one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club play hit in 1992 with &quot;Hear the Music&quot;).

Terry co-produced the song &quot;Shake&quot; on P.M. Dawn&#x27;s debut album &quot;Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience&quot;. The song ended with the repeated lyric &quot;Everyone thank Todd Terry&quot;. He also produced &quot;The House of Isis&quot; from Isis&#x27; 1990 album &quot;Rebel Soul&quot;.

In October 2004, &quot;Weekend&quot; by the Todd Terry Project appeared in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, playing on house music radio station SF-UR.

In 2007, Terry formed the Todd Terry All Stars, bringing Kenny Dope, DJ Sneak and Terry Hunter together to release the single &quot;Get Down&quot; featuring and co-written by Tara McDonald. The follow-up, &quot;Play On&quot;, also featured McDonald and was released in 2007 on Strictly Rhythm/Defected Records and then re-released in 2009 with a remix by Eddie Thoneick.

==Record labels==

InHouse Records was launched by Terry in 1999. It has been the vehicle through which Todd is able to release tracks to his fans without a filter.

Currently, Inhouse has over 500 commercially available tracks in the catalog including releases by House of Gypsies, Roland Clark, Shawnee Taylor, Kelly Sajda, Gypsymen, Black Riot, Leon Cormack, Lewis Beck, DJ E-Clyps and Todd Terry All Stars.

In 2000, Terry launched SoundDesign Records, the home to some of the harder tracks and artists he is working with, including releases from Danny Genius, Space Kadets, and Friscia and Lamboy.

In 2013, Terry released the album &quot;Todd Terry vs. That Trap Shitt&quot; on Tommy Boy Entertainment.

<text>Thomas Day (&quot;aka&quot; Thomas Daye III; 22 June 1748 – 28 September 1789) was a British author and abolitionist. He was well known for the book &quot;The History of Sandford and Merton&quot; (1783–1789) which emphasized Rousseauvian educational ideals, for his writings against slavery, for campaigning both for and against American independence, and for his project applying his educational ideals to young girls with the aim of raising a wife for himself.

==Early life==
Day was born on 22 June 1748 in London, the only child of Thomas and Jane Day. His father died when he was about a year old, but left him wealthy. He first attended a school in Stoke Newington, Middlesex, where the family lived at what is now 109-111 Church Street, but after a bout of smallpox which left his face permanently scarred he was moved to Charterhouse School. He subsequently attended Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he became a master debater and developed a close friendship with William Jones; he did not graduate and left the college in 1767.

==Life==
Day moved back to his family estate at Barehill, Berkshire, in 1766. There he met the progressive educator and inventor Richard Lovell Edgeworth, from whom he became almost inseparable. Together they resolved to educate Edgeworth&#x27;s son, Dick, in the style of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Edgeworth and the project converted Day to Rousseauism. He declared in 1769 that the two books he would save, were all the world&#x27;s books to be destroyed, would be the Bible and &quot;Emile&quot;. Day, Edgeworth and his son would later visit Rousseau in France. Because of his connection with Edgeworth, Day joined the Lunar Society in Lichfield, despite describing himself as a philosopher rather than a scientist, and formed friendships with Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward.

===Sabrina Sidney===

After this education project, Day undertook a second: he tried to train a wife. According to Anna Seward (who nevertheless observed that &quot;there was no finding such a creature ready made&quot;), his demands were modest: &quot;He resolved, if possible, that his wife should have a taste for literature and science, for moral and patriotic philosophy. So might she be his companion in that retirement, to which he had destined himself; and assist him forming the minds of his children to stubborn virtue and high exertion. He resolved also, that she should be simple as a mountain girl, in her dress, her diet and her manners, fearless and intrepid as the Spartan wives and Roman heroines.&quot;

Using Edgeworth&#x27;s name, Day applied to the Foundling Hospital to take first one and then another girl, initially aged 12 and 11; he told the Hospital that they were to be apprenticed as maids in Edgeworth&#x27;s household, which Edgeworth did not know of until several months later. He renamed them from Ann Kingston and Dorcas Car to Sabrina Sidney and Lucretia, respectively. What last name he chose for &#x27;Lucretia&#x27; is not known. He made a donation of fifty pounds to the Foundling Hospital and was appointed a member of the governing board.

After living in London with Sabrina Sidney for some time, Day took both girls to France in November 1769. His motives are unclear, as Day was a committed Francophobe, but leaving the country put him out of the reach of British law and the lawyers of the Foundling Hospital, who had been known to sue apprentice-masters who mistreated their apprentices. It also let him isolate the girls; he refused to hire English-speaking staff and would not let anyone teach the girls French. At one time he challenged a French military officer to a duel for speaking to one of the girls.

In the spring of 1770, Day decided that Lucretia, then aged 12, could not satisfy him intellectually as a wife, and returned to England, placing her in the home of a milliner&#x27;s family in Ludgate Hill with a payment of £400. With Sabrina, he leased Stowe House in Lichfield, near Edgeworth and the Lunar Society. At this point he still had not informed Sabrina, then aged 13, of his designs, and told her she was apprenticed to him as a servant. According to Rousseau, who had described how children should be taught not to fear pain or physical hardship, Day embarked on a programme of &#x27;lessons,&#x27; including dripping hot candle-wax onto Sabrina&#x27;s arms and forcing her to wade into cold water up to her neck. He also shot at her skirts with a pistol; accounts are divided on whether it was loaded. By 1771, Day had decided to abandon his &#x27;experiment,&#x27; and sent Sabrina to stay at a boarding school for the rest of her childhood.

Still living in Lichfield, he proposed marriage to Honora Sneyd, who would later marry his friend Edgeworth, and then proposed the same to her sister Elizabeth, who was briefly engaged to him but broke it off.

He met Esther Milnes (1753–1792), an heiress from Chesterfield, and they were married on 7 August 1778. The couple subsequently moved to a small estate at Stapleford Abbotts, near Abridge in Essex. They lived a very ascetic lifestyle and Esther was not allowed to contact her family. In 1780, the couple moved to Anningsley in Surrey, when Day bought a new estate there. It was a philanthropic project for both husband and wife and they laboured to improve the conditions of the working classes around them.

==Publications and political works==
In 1773, Day published his first work—&quot;The Dying Negro&quot;—a poem he had written with John Bicknell. It tells the story of a runaway slave, and sold well.

The contradiction between the claim that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and the existence of American slavery attracted comment from some quarters when the United States Declaration of Independence was first published; Congress, having made a few changes in wording, deleted nearly a fourth of the draft before publication, most notably removing a passage critical of the slave trade, as there were members of Congress who owned black slaves. Day was among those who noted the discrepancy, writing in 1776:

Day decided to study the law and in 1776 was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn; he rarely practised.

Day argued for the rights of the American colonists in his poem &quot;The Devoted Legions&quot; (1776) and in 1780 he argued in Parliament for an early peace with the revolutionaries as well as parliamentary reform. His speeches were also published as pamphlets.

It was as a writer for children that Day made his reputation. &quot;The History of Little Jack&quot; (1787) was extremely popular, but it could not match the sales of &quot;The History of Sandford and Merton&quot; (1783, 1786, 1789) which was a bestseller for over a hundred years. Embracing Rousseau&#x27;s dictates in many ways, it narrates the story of the rich, noble but spoiled Tommy Merton and his poor but virtuous friend Harry Sandford. Through trials and stories, Harry and the boys&#x27; tutor teach Tommy the importance of labor and the evils of the idle rich.

==Death==
Day believed that the traditional practice of breaking-in horses was harsh and unnecessary, and that if an animal was treated well, the need for severity could be avoided. He attempted to put his theory to the test with a colt on 28 September 1789 at Barehill, Berkshire, but was thrown from the horse, and died almost instantly. He was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wargrave, Berkshire.

<text>The common dace (Leuciscus leuciscus) is a species of freshwater and brackish water ray-finned fish from the family Cyprinidae which is native to Europe but which has been introduced to other parts of the world. It is a quarry species for coarse anglers.

==Description==
The common dace differs from other members in the genus &quot;Leuciscus&quot; found in Europe by its inferior mouth, slightly longer upper jaw which has the tip of the upper lip level with the centre line of the eye and the lack of an obvious snout. It has a yellowish iris and a body which is covered in large silvery scales, the lateral line having 49–52 scales. The anal fin has a concave margin and the caudal fin is forked. The dorsal fin has 2–3 spines and 7–9 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 8–9 soft rays. The maximum size attained is a total length of .

==Distribution==
The common dace is native to Europe and northern Asia where its occurs in the basins of the North Sea, Baltic Sea, White Sea and Barents Sea. It also occurs in the basin of the Caspian Sea in the drainage systems of the Volga and Ural Rivers and in the Black Sea basin it is found in the Danube and the Dnieper. In France it occurs in the Seine River drainage and in the drainages of the Rhone and Arc which flow into the Mediterranean. In the Danube main river of Romania as well as in Scandinavia north of 69°N and most of central Finland this species has a localised distribution. The populations from Siberia and East Asia are normally assigned to &quot;Leuciscus baicalensis&quot; and &quot;Leuciscus dzungaricus&quot;.

This species has been widely introduced in areas of Europe where it did not previously occur. For example, it has become established in Ireland since the early 1900s, having been taken there as a bait fish to catch larger fish such as pike. Following its introduction in Ireland, it has benefited from parasite release, meaning that with its introduction it has lost its normal set of parasites and might thus have a competitive advantage over native species.

==Habitat and biology== 
The common dace is found in rivers and streams, sometime occurring in lakes or in the brackish water at the mouths of rivers. It is a surface dwelling fish which gather in shoals of adults in the lower reaches of rivers and backwaters during the winter. Some adults remain upstream in the spawning grounds all winter as well. At spawning time, in March and April, they migrate up stream to lay their pale yellow eggs on shallow gravel beds in fast flowing streams, the eggs attach to gravel and stones. The juveniles hide among the cavities and roots in the bankside vegetation and as they mature they move into faster flowing water. The main food for common dace is small invertebrates.

==Angling==
The common dace is fished for by coarse anglers and the British rod caught record is . In some parts of Europe it is eaten but it is not highly regarded as a food fish. It is used as bait by anglers and that is thought to be the mechanism by which it was introduced to and spread in Ireland.

<text>A building co-operative is a co-operative housing corporation where individuals or families work together to directly construct their own homes in a cooperative fashion. 

Members of this type of co-operative purchase building materials in bulk and co-operate with other members of the co-op during the construction phase of the co-operative. When the housing has been completed the members usually own their homes directly. In some cases, roads, parkland and community facilities continue to be owned by the co-operative.

==History==
Building co-ops were extremely popular in many parts of Canada from the 1930s to the 1960s. Father James (Jimmy) Tompkins and Dr. Moses Coady were key organizers in Nova Scotia of the first building co-operatives. Through active local study groups they began research on co-operatives and developed a concept of how a building co-op could work.

In 1936, Father Tompkins helped found the first self-help building co-operative in North America near Glace Bay (Reserve Mines), Nova Scotia, Canada. A group of coal miners formed a housing cooperative with a loan of CAN $22,000. The housing loan was used to pay for building materials. Each miner&#x27;s personal contribution consisted of his labor or &quot;sweat equity&quot;. The miners worked together to build eleven homes which they moved into in 1938. These homes continue to be occupied today at Tompkinsville.

<text>Jean-Nicolas Pache (; 5 May 1746 – 18 November 1823) was a French politician, a Jacobin who served as Minister of War from October 1792 and Mayor of Paris from February 1793 to May 1794.

==Biography==
Pache was born in Verdun, but grew up in Paris, of Swiss parentage, the son of the concièrge of the hotel of Marshal de Castries. He became tutor to the marshal&#x27;s children, and subsequently first secretary at the ministry of marine, head of supplies (&quot;munitionnaire général des vivres&quot;), and comptroller of the king&#x27;s household. After spending several years in Switzerland with his family, he returned to France at the beginning of the Revolution.

He was employed successively at the ministries of the interior and of war, and was appointed on 20 September 1793 third deputy suppliant of Paris by the Luxembourg section. Thus brought into notice, he was made minister of war on 3 October 1792.

Pache was a Girondist himself, but aroused their hostility by his incompetence. He was supported, however, by Marat, and when he was superseded in the ministry of war by Beurnonville (4 February 1793) he was chosen mayor by the Parisians. In that capacity he contributed to the fall of the Girondists. Jean Nicolas Pache would be the first to submit a petition to the National Convention on 15 April 1793 for the totemic 22 Girondist leaders to be removed from office. Although he was scoffed at, the Commune would publish a petition for the removal of the same 22 Girondins, reinforced with 12,000 signatures, and submit it to the convention on 18 April. The petition would again be scoffed at by a Convention led by Girondins. Pache also brought before the convention a petition for a ’maximum’ on bread prices on 18 April. With a threat from the Commune issued to the convention, the maximum was voted on 4 May. However, Pache and Chaumette would lead a march on the Convention on Insurrection of 31 May-2 June 1793. The convention was ultimately forced to hand over the 22 in order to appease the threatening crowd, reinforced with National Guard troops and François Hanriot who had arrived on the Convention floor. Pache turned his attention to the matter of the constitution. He wrote to the departments calling for them to give the people what they had fought for time and again: the new constitution that had been promised.

His relations with Jacques Hébert and Pierre Gaspard Chaumette, and with the enemies of Robespierre led to his arrest on 10 May 1794. Jean Nicolas Pache would be replaced as mayor by Lescot-Fleuriot, who was more subservient to the convention. He owed his safety only to the amnesty of 25 October 1795. After acting as commissary to the civil hospitals of Paris in 1799, he retired from public life, and died at Thin-le-Moutier on 18 November 1823.

==Impact==
Jean Nicholas Pache may not have single-handedly brought down the Girondin, but his determination played an important role. Pache was a key player in changing the political scene in Paris in this time. 
Pache also helped to truly give power to the people of Paris. The people of Paris had successfully humiliated the Convention in forcing it to do their bidding and the convention would not recover this lost power until the Thermidorian Reaction shattered the power of the Jacobin Clubs and sans culottes. The people of Paris would not forget this and the legacy of &quot;the people in arms&quot; would have a long-term impact on the French revolutionary tradition, in the readiness of the Parisian population to &quot;rush to the barricades,&quot; through the 19th and 20th centuries.

<text>The Frans Hals Museum (formerly &quot;Stedelijk Museum van Haarlem&quot;) is a museum in the North Holland city of Haarlem, the Netherlands, founded in 1862, known as the Art Museum of Haarlem. Its collection is based on the city&#x27;s own rich collection, built up from the 16th century onwards. The museum owns hundreds of paintings, including more than a dozen by Frans Hals, to whom the museum owes its name. The Frans Hals Museum has two historic locations in Haarlem city centre: the main location on Groot Heiligland and Location Hal on Grote Markt, composed of the adjacent 17th-century Vleeshal and 19th-century Verweyhal. On Groot Heiligland is the 17th-century Oudemannenhuis with regent&#x27;s rooms. It houses the famous paintings by Frans Hals and other ancient, modern and contemporary art, as well as the museum café. Location Hal regularly hosts exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. 

== History of the Oudemannenhuis ==

The Haarlem Old Men&#x27;s Almhouse (&quot;Oudemannenhuis)&quot; was a hofje founded in 1609. The residential rooms were situated around a courtyard in the style of contemporary Haarlem Hofjes. Each of the thirty little houses was inhabited by two men; to be eligible to living there they had to be at least 60 years old, honest Haarlem residents, and single. They were required to bring their own household goods listed as a bed, a chair with a cushion, a tin chamberpot, three blankets, six good shirts and six nightcaps. They were locked in each night at eight o&#x27;clock in the summer and at seven in the winter. The residents had to make a weekly collection with a poor-box, and a statue of a man holding this can be seen in the entrance hall of the museum. The old men&#x27;s home was governed by five regents, whose portraits, painted by Frans Hals in 1664, are on display.

Though the men&#x27;s home dates from 1609, only the main hall is still mostly intact. During the intervening centuries the complex was renovated beyond recognition, most notably by the previous inhabitants, the Haarlem municipal orphanage which made use of the complex from 1810 until 1908, when it moved to the Coen Cuserhof. During the French occupation, the old men still living in the hofje were moved a block away to the present-day Proveniershuis, when the art collections of the two institutions were merged. The art of both locations, as well as the art of several other former Haarlem institutions, is now in the Frans Hals museum collection. The most notable artworks from the Oude Mannenhuis are the two group portraits of regents and regentesses by Frans Hals. The inventory of the Proveniershuis was drawn up by Pieter Langendijk and though some of the paintings have since been reattributed, his list is largely intact. The impressive regents&#x27; rooms have been rebuilt from other Haarlem locations. A room on the street side has a curious keystone above the door with masonic symbols denoting a mason&#x27;s society and the text &#x27;Metsselaars Proef-Kamer 1648 12/29&#x27;.

== History of the collection ==

The older pieces of the museum collection, consisting of primarily religious themes, are Haarlem relics from the Reformation, when all Roman Catholic art was formally seized by the city council in 1648. Frans Hals himself worked as the first official city-paid restorer for some of these pieces. The city council then proceeded in the 17th century to rewrite Haarlem history, and purchased various large pieces to decorate the city hall, telling stories such as the legend of Damiate, or the legend of the Haarlem Shield. During this time the city hall functioned as a semi-public museum, though the term didn&#x27;t even exist yet. The first signs of an official museum with a curator occurred when the Dutch Society of Science, founded in 1752, started to rent the Prinsenhof room of the city hall in 1754 for its meetings and began to furnish it as a Cabinet of curiosities. From an inventory list in the city archives it can be seen that they used as a model for their system of naming and presentation, the book &quot;Amboinsche Rariteitkamer&quot; by Georg Eberhard Rumphius. They shared the room with the Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church, that used it once every six years for its meetings. They hired a woman for the dusting and serving tea, and in 1768 they hired a man as curator, who was responsible for the entire collection and the medical &quot;Hortus&quot; garden in the yard.

The spacious room soon proved too small for the number of donated artifacts it received from its members, thanks to the increase in shipping and associated travel. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, Haarlem became a bedroom community of Amsterdam, with many wealthy bankers becoming members of the young Society. The old paintings became just a colorful backdrop for chests filled with stuffed animals and prepared specimens. In 1777 the Society moved its overflowing collection to a renovated house on the Grote Houtstraat, where the new young curator Martin van Marum would live the rest of his life. This building, situated next to the Mennonite church, was mortgaged with the Mennonite banker Pieter Teyler van der Hulst, who was not a member of the Society, but who created his own arts society and whose later testament would be the basis for the Teylers Museum, where van Marum would also become curator.

This move essentially split the collection, and the &quot;natural history half&quot; is currently in the collection of the Teylers Museum. Though the paintings and the garden remained back at city hall, 40 years after Carl Linnaeus had published his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; no one was interested in the garden (which was set up as a living version of that book), and still fewer people were interested in the religious art. The city hall was seen as a depot of large pieces of historical importance, and the next large group of paintings to join the collection occurred when Napoleon disbanded the guilds in the Netherlands in 1794. The guilds&#x27; property reverted to the state. This is how the larger pieces that Hals painted for the guilds came into the collection. Without an official curator, the painting collection was only available to be seen by appointment with the city clerk, a situation that has remained up to the present day for the large pieces still located there, such as the whalebone from Willem Barentsz trip to Nova Zembla or the portrait of Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer.

===Collection as of 1862===
In the mid-19th century the back cloisters were given an extra floor for additional showing space, and it was at this time that the museum opened its doors to the public via a separate entrance than the main city hall entrance. This was also the first time that all the group portraits could be shown hanging near each other. No works of modern art were bought at that time, and the decision to form the museum was to cater to the visitors of other Haarlem museums. At the time, modern art could be seen at the nearby Teylers Eerste Schilderijenzaal in Teylers Museum, and also in the gallery of the &quot;Museum voor Levende Nederlandsche Meesters&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;Haarlemsche Paviljoen&quot;, a museum that was open from 1838 until 1885 in the former home of Henry Hope he called Villa Welgelegen. The art critic Victor de Stuers was very angry about Haarlem being the location of such museums, as there was no artistic climate there to speak of. He criticized the collection at the Paviljoen for lacking works by contemporary painters such as &quot;Israëls, Bosboom, Bles, Bisschop, van de Sande Bakhuijzen, Bakker Korff, and Alma Tadema&quot;, and though works by these painters were already on view at Teylers at the time, the Frans Hals museum collection only has a few paintings by the first two in their collection today. Stuers also felt it was a scandal that the city fathers in charge of the municipal museum made no effort to stop the sale of a portrait of Willem van Heythuijzen to the Brussels museum in 1872.

Thus this antiquated collection is the one that was transferred to the Groot Heiligland in 1913, and large pieces that were not in the cloisters at that time, such as the painting by Dirck Ferreris installed in the mayor&#x27;s room, remained at city hall. A few of these were formally given to the museum in 1962, such as The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627 and The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630. In 1962 when the museum celebrated its 100th anniversary as a municipal collection, the collection had already been split again into a modern and a classical one, with the modern art housed in a new wing on the north side of the complex. Today the modern art is displayed in the Verweyhal. The museum celebrated its 100th anniversary on the Groot Heiligland in 2013 with a Frans Hals exhibition that included reproductions being placed around the city in original locations.

== Collection ==

In the late 19th century the museum became something of a pilgrimage site for young impressionists, who were fascinated by the loose brushwork visible in the two group portraits of regents by Hals that he painted when he was in his eighties. This is the reason that after the move to the present location in 1913, the museum took on the name of Frans Hals as these were considered the most prominent paintings of the collection at the time. The museum is still famous for group portraits by Hals, but since the group portraits from the military guilds were cleaned in the early 20th century, it is these which most visitors come to see today. Most of the objects and paintings can not be displayed for lack of space, and the museum rotates its collection through exhibitions at various locations in Haarlem, though works by some prominent painters cannot be lent out and remain in storage.

The museum&#x27;s collection has a size of 17,000 objects, about half of which are modern art. The museum holds about 800 paintings from the Dutch 17th century. The collection also includes silver and glassware and furniture. The depot, as well as the restoration studio, is located in the attics. Climatic conditions were so bad that in 2005 the museum considered selling two paintings to finance an external depot. This led to dismissive reactions from the State Secretary for Culture, among others, and the heirs also appeared to be unaware. After an asbestos clean-up in 2011, the condition improved somewhat, but the structural lack of money remained.

=== Frans Hals ===
Frans Hals ranks with Rembrandt and Vermeer among the most famous and innovative painters of the Dutch 17th century. His smoothly painted, lively portraits of real people have inspired visitors and other artists for centuries. Famous modern artists such as Manet and Van Gogh even travelled to Haarlem to admire his group portraits of bailiffs and regents.

Frans Hals was born around 1582 in Antwerp, but grew up in Haarlem. His parents moved north soon after his birth to escape Spanish rule. Frans Hals probably trained as an artist with Karel van Mander. In 1610, Hals became a member of the Sint-Lucas guild of artists.

His loose touch caught the eye and earned him numerous commissions for portraits. In 1616, Hals completed his first large group portrait: the militia piece of the St George&#x27;s militia. He received four more commissions for militia pieces. They are now world-famous and all hang in the Frans Hals Museum.

===Installed art from other Haarlem locations===
Several stately rooms saved from torn-down Haarlem houses have been partially reconstructed and a collection of Haarlem silver saved from various local churches can be seen in the former regent rooms of the almshouse, which now seem much grander than they were originally. The windows have been decorated with art by anonymous Haarlem glass artists, most of which has been acquired through municipal demolitions work. Spread along the corridors are beautiful Dutch tiles from local salvage operations that have been installed along the walls, accompanied by 17th century furniture including clocks, chairs, and chests.

The museum as an institution is only responsible for its collection, which is mostly oil paintings. Other applied art that has been installed is the responsibility of the municipal culture department, and the museum rents the premises from them. This is the reason that visitors are offered much more information about the paintings than about other aspects of the building, including the objects in the courtyard.

Between 1605 and 1635 over 100,000 paintings were produced in Haarlem. Not all of these have survived, and most have left town, but this does say something about the artistic climate in the city. At that time art ownership in the city was 25%, a record high. More art has survived up to today from that period in Haarlem than from any other Dutch city, thanks mostly to the &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot; published by Karel van Mander there in 1604. The former curator Pieter Biesboer has created inventories of Haarlem art and worked on several catalogues for the museum, mostly based on the works created before 1800.

What follows is a list of the prominent painters through the centuries on display in the museum.

<text>Of Thee I Sing is a musical with a score by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin and a book by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind. The musical lampoons American politics; the story concerns John P. Wintergreen, who runs for President of the United States on the &quot;love&quot; platform. When he falls in love with the sensible Mary Turner instead of Diana Devereaux, the beautiful pageant winner selected for him, he gets into political hot water.

The original Broadway production, directed by Kaufman, opened in 1931 and ran for 441 performances, gaining critical and box office success. It has been revived twice on Broadway and in concert stagings in the U.S. and in London. In 1932, &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; was the first musical to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

==Background==
The Gershwins and George S. Kaufman had collaborated on the satirical 1927 musical &quot;Strike up the Band,&quot; which played in Philadelphia. The show concerned a cheese manufacturer who sponsors a war against Switzerland because it will be named after him.

Later that year, Kaufman and Ryskind conceived a new musical focusing on satire about rival political parties battling over a new national anthem. The Gershwin brothers agreed to write the score, although they were scheduled to be in Hollywood writing songs for the film &quot;Delicious&quot;. Kaufman and Ryskind soon realized that their concept did not provide sufficient plot for a musical. They crafted a libretto inspired by the timeless battle of political idealism with corruption and incompetency, creating the first American musical with a consistently satiric tone. The writers and the cast were unsure of what the public&#x27;s reception would be, prompting Kaufman&#x27;s now-famous retort: &quot;Satire is what closes on Saturday night.&quot;

==Plot==
===Act I===
In the U.S. in the 1930s, a campaign parade is taking place to support &quot;Wintergreen for President&quot;. John P. Wintergreen has been nominated for President and Alexander Throttlebottom has been nominated for Vice President, but he is of such little importance no one can remember who he is. Politicians meet in a hotel room to devise a campaign platform, and when they ask the chambermaid what she cares about, she first says &quot;money,&quot; then &quot;love&quot; when pressed further. The men decide that Wintergreen&#x27;s platform will be &quot;love&quot;; they&#x27;ll have a pageant to select the most beautiful girl in the United States, and Wintergreen will fall in love and marry her.

The pageant begins in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the contestants wonder, &quot;Who Is the Lucky Girl to Be?&quot; The photographers assure them that even if they do not win, they will surely be loved (&quot;The Dimple on My Knee&quot;). Wintergreen is getting nervous about marrying a girl he doesn&#x27;t know. While the girls are at the final judging, he confides in Mary Turner, the sensible young woman running the pageant. He does not want to marry a girl just because she&#x27;s beautiful; he wants a wife who will make a good home for him and his future children. Mary shares her corn muffin with him. Wintergreen tells Mary that he&#x27;d rather marry her than any of the girls in the contest. He kisses her, and she agrees to marry him. The judges of the pageant announce that Diana Devereaux, a beautiful southern girl, has won the contest, but Wintergreen declares that he loves Mary Turner. When he gives some of Mary&#x27;s extraordinary corn muffins to the judges, they agree that John and Mary are meant to wed (&quot;Because, Because&quot;).

Outside Madison Square Garden in New York City, at a rally for Wintergreen, the campaigners declare that &quot;Love Is Sweeping the Country&quot;. Inside, where politicians are speaking in favor of Wintergreen, a wrestling match is going on just below the speakers&#x27; platform as Alexander Throttlebottom tries to explain to the organizers that he&#x27;s the candidate for Vice-President. Wintergreen proposes to Mary onstage, as he has in forty-seven states before. She accepts again, and Wintergreen sings the campaign song to her, &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;.

On election night, Wintergreen wins by a landslide. Inauguration Day arrives, which is also Wintergreen&#x27;s wedding day. As his inaugural address, Wintergreen bids goodbye to the girls he used to know (&quot;Here&#x27;s a Kiss for Cinderella&quot;). The Chief Justice presides over the wedding ceremony, and just after he has pronounced John and Mary man and wife, Diana Devereaux interrupts the proceedings. She is serving Wintergreen with a summons for breach of promise. She insists she is the one he should have married (&quot;I Was the Most Beautiful Blossom&quot;). The Supreme Court rules that Mary&#x27;s corn muffins are more important than justice in this matter, and Diana angrily leaves to tell her story across the nation. Wintergreen leads the Supreme Court and spectators in a chorus of &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;.

===Act II===
John and Mary settle down to business in the White House. Her &quot;desk,&quot; back-to-back with his, is a fully loaded tea-table. Their secretaries greet each other &quot;Hello, Good Morning&quot;. Alexander Throttlebottom, now Vice-President, sneaks into the White House with a tour group. When a guide tells him that the Vice-President&#x27;s job is to preside over the U. S. Senate, Throttlebottom eagerly dashes off to the Capitol. Wintergreen&#x27;s fellow party members inform him that Diana Devereaux is gaining support across the nation. Wintergreen holds a press conference and tells the reporters that his love for Mary is the only thing that matters (&quot;Who Cares?&quot;). The French ambassador unexpectedly arrives (&quot;Garçon, S&#x27;il Vous Plaît&quot;). He has a surprise for Mr. Wintergreen: Diana is &quot;&#x27;The Illegitimate Daughter&#x27; of an illegitimate son of an illegitimate nephew of Napoleon.&quot; He insists that Wintergreen annul his marriage and marry Diana to right his grievous offense against France. Everyone agrees that Wintergreen should be impeached for breach of promise (&quot;We&#x27;ll Impeach Him&quot;), but John and Mary do not care, since they have each other (&quot;Who Cares?&quot; (Reprise)).

Throttlebottom has found the Senate, and the party members inform him that he will soon be President. He is very excited and goes into the Senate Chamber to preside, beginning by taking &quot;The Roll Call.&quot; The resolution on the impeachment of the President is brought up, and the French Ambassador and Diana mournfully insist that she was &quot;Jilted.&quot; Mary saves the day when she announces that she is pregnant (&quot;Who Could Ask for Anything More?&quot;). The senators refuse to impeach an expectant father, and Wintergreen declares that &quot;Posterity&quot; is just around the corner. The French Ambassador informs Wintergreen that by not marrying Diana, he has contributed to France&#x27;s declining birth rate. He demands the Wintergreens&#x27; baby as a replacement for the one they have &quot;taken&quot; from France. John refuses, and the ambassador walks out.

In the Yellow Room of the White House, guests are arriving bearing gifts for the baby (&quot;Trumpeter, Blow Your Horn&quot;). Wintergreen is nervously awaiting the baby&#x27;s birth when the French Ambassador arrives with a final message from France: surrender the baby or France will sever diplomatic relations with the U.S. The Supreme Court justices, who have the duty to determine the sex of the baby, announce that twins have been born, a boy and a girl. The French ambassador is even more wounded by this proclamation: France has lost two babies instead of one! Diana mournfully joins him, and Alexander Throttlebottom arrives bearing sweaters for the babies. The French Ambassador is about to declare war when Wintergreen has a brilliant idea: according to Article Twelve of the Constitution, when the President of the United States is unable to fulfill his duties, his obligations are assumed by the Vice-President! The ambassador calls Wintergreen a genius, and Throttlebottom is ecstatic as they pass Diana over to him. Servants wheel a large bed into the room, where Mary sits with the babies. Wintergreen leads everyone in proclaiming, &quot;Of Thee I Sing.&quot;

:*The campaign song &quot;Wintergreen for President&quot; includes parts of folk and patriotic songs such as Sousa&#x27;s &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; and &quot;Hail, Hail, the Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot;. The song has been adopted by the Harvard University Band as a pep song, and it is traditionally played at Harvard football games.
:**The music introducing the French and their ambassador includes the opening bars of Gershwin&#x27;s own &quot;An American in Paris&quot;.

==Musical and dramatic analysis==
&quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; was the most musically sophisticated of the Gershwin shows up to then, inspired by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan and boasting a varied score including extensive recitative, choral commentary, marches, pastiches, elaborate contrapuntal passages, and ballads. Most songs were lengthy and included a large ensemble. As an integrated song-and-story production it produced fewer hit songs than many of the Gershwins&#x27; musicals. Ira Gershwin explained, &quot;In the show there are no verse-and-chorus songs; there is a sort of recitative running along, and lots of finales and finalettos.&quot; 
Ira Gershwin recalled that the title song, inspired by the final phrase of &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;, was somewhat controversial among the production staff. &quot;When we first played this sentimental political campaign song... there were objectors who thought that juxtaposing the dignified &#x27;of thee I sing&#x27; with a slangy &#x27;baby&#x27; was going a bit too far. Our response was that, naturally, we&#x27;d replace it with something else if the paying audience didn&#x27;t take to it. Opening night, and even weeks later, one could hear a continuous &#x27;Of thee I sing, baby!&#x27; in the lobby at intermission time.&quot; The music was &quot;employed throughout in what was unquestionably the most closely integrated manner of any Broadway show to that time... Almost everything...was created with a skill that had rarely been equaled in the musical comedy theatre.&quot;

&quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; was the first American musical with a consistently satirical tone. Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court, the presidency, and the democratic process itself were all targets of this satire, prompting original stars William Gaxton and Victor Moore to wonder if they would face government repercussions for their portrayals of President Wintergreen and Vice President Throttlebottom. Specific political parties are not identified in the musical, as Kaufman and Ryskind believed that absurdity was bipartisan in Depression-era politics.

==Productions==
The original Broadway production, directed by Kaufman, opened at the Music Box Theatre on December 26, 1931, and ran for 441 performances. The cast included William Gaxton as John P. Wintergreen, Lois Moran as Mary Turner, Grace Brinkley as Diana Devereaux, Victor Moore as Alexander Throttlebottom, and George Murphy as Sam Jenkins. It was produced by Sam H. Harris. Sets were designed by Jo Mielziner, costumes by Carles LeMaire, and dances staged by Georgie Hale. It was Gaxton and Moore&#x27;s first comedic pairing; they would collaborate on six more Broadway musicals, including &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. The orchestrations were by Robert Russell Bennett, William Daly (including the &quot;Overture&quot;), and Gershwin (&quot;Hello, Good Morning&quot;). &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; was the longest-running Gershwin show during George Gershwin&#x27;s lifetime.

There were Broadway revivals in 1933 at the Imperial Theatre and in 1952 at the Ziegfeld Theatre, both directed by Kaufman. A concert production of &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; was mounted by Ian Marshall Fisher&#x27;s Lost Musicals series at the Barbican Centre in London in August 1996. Fisher&#x27;s series examines the Gershwins&#x27; lesser known works (as well as others) and has been based at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House and Sadler&#x27;s Wells. The musical was presented in 1990 by the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players and in May 2006 as part of the New York City Center &quot;Encores!&quot; staged concert series. Directed by John Rando and choreographed by Randy Skinner, the cast starred Victor Garber as Wintergreen, Jefferson Mays as Throttlebottom, and Jennifer Laura Thompson as First Lady. It was revived in July 2015 at the Royal Festival Hall, London, by producer Ollie Rosenblatt as a full musical with orchestra. Devereaux was played by Hannah Waddingham, Wintergreen by Hadley Fraser, and Throttlebottom by Tom Edden. The Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra provided a new orchestration for the piece. In September 2015 the Sqabbalogic theatre company and Sydney Philharmonia Choirs presented the musical in the Concert Hall, Sydney Opera House.

==Adaptations==
A television version was produced in 1972 by CBS, mostly starring actors then appearing in CBS series, including Carroll O&#x27;Connor as President Wintergreen. A National Radio Theater version starring John Cullum was broadcast by NPR in 1984 and the BBC in 1984 and 1992.

In the 1930s, the Marx Brothers had intended to produce a film adaptation of the musical, but they decided to make &quot;Duck Soup&quot; instead. Many scholars draw parallels between &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; and &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, suggesting that the musical helped provide inspiration for that Marx Brothers classic.

A musical sequel to &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; was written by the same team: &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot; was produced on Broadway in 1933, reusing some of the music from its predecessor. However, the sequel was a critical and box-office failure. &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot; marked the last Broadway musical written by the Gershwins (counting &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; as an opera rather than a musical).

==Critical reception==
Brooks Atkinson in the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the musical &quot;a brisk musical comedy&quot;, writing that &quot;There is dancing, both routine and inventive. There are lyrics done in Ira Gershwin&#x27;s neatest style...Best of all, there is Mr. Gershwin&#x27;s score. Whether it is satire, wit, doggerel or fantasy, Mr. Gershwin pours music out in full measure and in many voices. Although the book is lively, Mr. Gershwin is exuberant.&quot;

In 1932, &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; became the first musical to win the Pulitzer Prize for drama. The 1932 Pulitzer Prize Committee stated, &quot;&quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; is not only coherent and well-knit enough to class as a play, but it is a biting and true satire on American politics and the public attitude towards them... The play is genuine and it is felt the Pulitzer Prize could not serve a better purpose than to recognize such work. The prize was awarded only to Kaufman, Ryskind and Ira Gershwin; George Gershwin received no recognition, since the Pulitzer Prize was considered a literary award. In 1998, at the centennial of his birth, he was posthumously awarded an honorary Pulitzer.

In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the 2006 concert revival, Charles Isherwood called &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; &quot;a trenchant little musical satire... the laughter that greets the show today is tinged with surprise at how eerily some of its jokes seem to take precise aim, from decades back, at current affairs. A chorus of reporters sings to the new president of the &#x27;17 vacations you have had since you&#x27;ve been here.&#x27; A politician dismisses Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s pronouncement about not being able to fool all of the people all the time by remarking: &#x27;It&#x27;s different nowadays. People are bigger suckers.&#x27; ...it serves as a sigh-inducing argument for the enduring follies of American politics.&quot;

<text>Marguerite-Élie Guadet (, 20 July 1758 – 19 June 1794) was a French political figure of the Revolutionary period.

==Rise to prominence==
Born in Saint-Émilion, Gironde, Aquitaine, he had already gained a reputation as a lawyer in Bordeaux by the time of the Revolution. In 1790 he was made administrator of the Gironde, and in 1791 president of the criminal tribunal, being elected to the Legislative Assembly as one of the group of deputies known subsequently as Girondists.

As a supporter of the monarchist and liberal constitution of 1791 he joined the Jacobin Club, and here and in the Assembly became an eloquent advocate of all the measures directed against real or supposed traitors to the Constitution.

He strongly opposed the ministers of King Louis XVI, and was largely instrumental in forcing the king to accept the Girondist ministry of 15 March 1792. He supported the policy of forcing Louis XVI into harmony with the Revolution, and moved (3 May) for the dismissal of the king&#x27;s non-juring confessor, for the banishment of all non-juring priests (16 May), for the disbandment of the royal guard (30 May), and the formation in Paris of a &quot;camp des fédérés&quot; (4 June).

==August insurrection and National Convention==
Nevertheless, he remained a Royalist, and, with Armand Gensonné and Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud, even addressed a letter to the king soliciting a private interview. Whatever negotiations may have resulted, however, were cut short by the insurrection of 10 August. Guadet, who presided over the Assembly during part of the rebellion day, placed himself into strong opposition to the insurrectionary Paris Commune, and it was on his motion that on 30 August the Assembly voted its dissolution – a decision reversed on the following day. In September, Guadet was returned by a large majority as deputy to the National Convention.

At the trial of Louis XVI he voted for an appeal to the people and for the death penalty, but with a respite pending appeal. In March 1793 he had several meetings with Georges Danton, who was anxious to bring about a &quot;rapprochement&quot; between the Girondists and The Mountain during the Revolt in the Vendée, but he unconditionally refused to join with the man whom he held responsible for the September Massacres.

Guadet was targeted during the fall of the Girondists, and his arrest being decreed on 2 June 1793, he fled to Caen, and afterwards hid in his father&#x27;s house in Saint-Émilion. He was discovered and taken to Bordeaux, where, after his identity had been established, he was guillotined.

<text>David Gordon Green (born April 9, 1975) is an American filmmaker. Green began his career in 1997 and gained fame with the independent film &quot;George Washington&quot; (2000). He directed two additional independent dramas, &quot;All the Real Girls&quot; (2003) and &quot;Snow Angels&quot; (2007), as well as the thriller &quot;Undertow&quot; (2004), all of which he wrote or co-wrote. 

In 2008, Green transitioned into Hollywood studio comedies, directing the films &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; (2008), &quot;Your Highness&quot; and &quot;The Sitter&quot; (both 2011). He briefly returned to his dramatic roots with the independent films &quot;Prince Avalanche&quot; (2013), &quot;Joe&quot; (2013), and &quot;Manglehorn&quot; (2014). Following this departure, he returned to studio films with &quot;Our Brand Is Crisis&quot; (2015) and &quot;Stronger&quot; (2017). Green directed a trilogy of slasher films for the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise: &quot;Halloween&quot; (2018), &quot;Halloween Kills&quot; (2021), and &quot;Halloween Ends&quot; (2022), which he co-wrote with frequent collaborator Danny McBride. Most recently, Green directed &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot; (2023) and the Christmas comedy &quot;Nutcrackers&quot; (2024).

Green has also directed episodes of the comedy series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot; (2009–2013), &quot;Red Oaks&quot; (2014–17), &quot;Vice Principals&quot; (2016–17), and &quot;The Righteous Gemstones&quot; (2019–present), on all of which he additionally served as executive producer.

==Early life==

Green, one of four children, was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and grew up in Richardson, Texas. His mother, Jean Ann (née Hunter), was a Lamaze instructor, and his father, Hubert Gordon Green, Jr., was a medical school dean. Green attended Richardson High School, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he studied film directing. He currently lives in Charleston, South Carolina.

== Career ==

As a college student, Green made the two short films, &quot;Pleasant Grove&quot; and &quot;Physical Pinball&quot;, at the North Carolina School of the Arts prior to his feature film debut in 2000, the critically acclaimed &quot;George Washington&quot;, which he both wrote and directed. He followed that with &quot;All the Real Girls&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Undertow&quot; in 2004. In 2007, he directed &quot;Snow Angels&quot;, his first adaptation, based on the Stewart O&#x27;Nan novel. The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival and stars Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale. It was released by Warner Independent Pictures. 

In 2008, Green&#x27;s career transitioned when he directed the Seth Rogen buddy comedy &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;, and the HBO series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;, for which he directed twelve episodes and served as a consulting producer. In 2011, he co-created the animated series &quot;Good Vibes&quot; and directed the comedies &quot;Your Highness&quot; and &quot;The Sitter&quot;, both of which received negative reviews.

In 2013, Green briefly returned to independent film when he directed and co-wrote &quot;Prince Avalanche&quot; and &quot;Joe&quot;. He followed these films with &quot;Manglehorn&quot; (2014), &quot;Our Brand Is Crisis&quot; (2015), and &quot;Stronger&quot; (2017).

In 2018, Green directed the horror sequel &quot;Halloween&quot;, produced by Jason Blum, executive produced by John Carpenter, and co-written by Green and Danny McBride. He also directed its sequels &quot;Halloween Kills&quot;, released in October 2021, and &quot;Halloween Ends&quot;, released in October 2022.

In December 2020, it was announced Green will direct a new installment of &quot;The Exorcist franchise&quot; which will be a direct sequel to William Friedkin&#x27;s 1973 film adaptation of the 1971 novel. &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot; was released in October 2023.

Green subsequently directed the Christmas-set comedy &quot;Nutcrackers&quot;, which premiered at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. Of the film, Green stated; &quot;This movie is a lot of things. It&#x27;s a comedy, it&#x27;s a drama, it&#x27;s a horror movie. But for me, it&#x27;s a reason to dance, you know, I just wanted to start moving, move my body a little bit, and get out to the farm and kick some pig shit.&quot;

== Influences ==

Green&#x27;s favorite films are, in order, &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;The Gravy Train&quot;, &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

It has been suggested, even by the director himself, that Green&#x27;s early films (most notably &quot;George Washington&quot;) take influence from the works of Terrence Malick. Malick himself served as an executive producer of Green&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Undertow&quot;.

<text>Maximin Isnard (; 16 November 1755 Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes – 12 March 1825 Grasse), French revolutionary, was a dealer in perfumery at Draguignan when he was elected deputy for the &quot;département&quot; of the Var to the Legislative Assembly, where he joined the Girondists. As the president of the National Convention Isnard, who had enough of the tyranny of the Paris Commune, threatened the destruction of Paris. He declared that the Convention would not be influenced by any violence and that Paris had to respect the representatives from elsewhere in France. Isnard was asked to give up his seat.

== Before the French Revolution ==


Born in 1755, he is the youngest son of Maximin Isnard (1731-1799) and Anne Thérèse Fanton, cousin of the Fantons of Andon. He is the grandson (on the paternal line) of Jacques Isnard, merchant curator, was lord of Deux-Frères and Esclapon, and of Claire Courmes, both from old families of the bourgeoisie of Grasse.

His sister Françoise (1722-1805), wife of Antoine Court (they had several children: Honoré, Michel and Joseph Court d&#x27;Esclapon and de Fontmichel). His niece, Marie Marguerite Justine Isnard, married Claude-Marie Courmes (1770-1865) in 1801.

He married Madeleine Clérion in 1778. They had a son, Jean-Jacques (1784-1845), Baron Isnard, private receiver of finances, who married Eugénie-Gabrielle Luce in 1813, daughter of the banker Honoré-François Luce. Their grandson Joseph-Honoré (1817-1898) was confirmed in the title of Baron Isnard by letters patent of September 7, 1864.

He became perfumer in Draguignan before opening a factory specializing in silk and soap.

== Legislative Assembly ==

Isnard was quickly a revolutionary in accepting &quot;new ideas&quot; at the beginning of the Revolution, in 1789–1790.

On 9 September 1791, he was elected member of Legislative Assembly by the department of Var, in southeastern of France (district of Draguignan.

Isnard was linked to Brissot and sat at the left of the Assembly. He was very violent in his talks. For example, in his opinion, the French State had to deport all priests who have not accepted the Revolution.

He supported the &quot;brissotins&quot; who wanted a war against foreign countries, in order to strengthen Revolution.

Attacking the court, and the Austrian committee in the Tuileries, he demanded the disbandment of the king&#x27;s bodyguard, and reproached Louis XVI for infidelity to the constitution. But on 20 June 1792, when the crowd invaded the palace, he was one of the deputies who went to place themselves beside the king to protect him.

== Member of the National Convention ==

Elected to the National Convention in September 1792, he was sent to the army of the North, near Nice, to justify the insurrection ; he announced the take of Sospel and went back to Paris in autumn.

He voted for the death of Louis XVI in January 1793 and became a member of the Committee of General Security.

The committee, consisting of 25 members, proved unwieldy, and on 4 April, Isnard presented, on behalf of the Girondist majority, the report recommending a smaller committee of nine, which two days later was established as the Committee of Public Safety.

== President of the National Convention (May 1793) ==

He was elected President of the Convention on 16 May 1793.

Isnard was presiding at the Convention when a deputation of the commune of Paris came to demand that Jacques René Hébert should be set at liberty, and he made the famous reply: &quot;If by these insurrections, continually renewed, it should happen that the principle of national representation should suffer, I declare to you in the name of France that soon people will search the banks of the Seine to see if Paris has ever existed&quot;

== Flight ==

On 2 June 1793 he offered his resignation as representative of the people, but was not comprised in the decree by which the Convention determined upon the arrest of twenty-nine Girondists. On 3 October, however, his arrest was decreed along with that of several other Girondist deputies who had left the Convention and were fomenting civil war in the departments.

== 1794–1795 ==

Initially proscribed during the Thermidorian Reaction, he was allowed to return to the Convention on 4 December 1794.

Seating to the Right, he became an adversary of more extremist revolutionaries.

In May 1795, he was sent to the &quot;département&quot; of Bouches-du-Rhône to uncover and prosecute fleeing Jacobins, which led him to being suspected of royalist sympathies.

== 1795–1797 ==

On 13 October 1795, now regarded as a royalist, he was elected deputy for the Var to the Council of Five Hundred, where he played a very insignificant role.

In 1797 he retired to Draguignan.

== End of life ==

In 1802, he published a pamphlet titled &quot;De l&#x27;immortalité de l&#x27;âme&quot; (&quot;Immortality of Soul&quot;), in which he praised Catholicism, and in 1804 another pamphlet, &quot;Réflexions relatives au sénatus-consulte du 28 floréal an XII&quot;, an enthusiastic apology for the Empire.

He was a supporter of Napoléon Bonaparte, who named him Baron in 1813.

Upon the restoration he professed such royalist sentiments that he was not disturbed, in spite of the 1816 law proscribing members of the Convention who had voted to execute the king.

In 1825, he died in Grasse, in a deep anonymity.

<text>The Spaarne is a river in North Holland, Netherlands. This partially canalized river connects the Ringvaart to a side branch of the North Sea Canal. It runs through Haarlem, Heemstede, and Spaarndam.

The historic canals of Haarlem&#x27;s moats are connected to the Spaarne. A lock at Spaarndam separates it from the North Sea Canal.

According to Sterck-Proot, a historian, the name Spaarne probably comes from &quot;Spier&quot;, which means reed in old Dutch.

==History==
The river formerly flowed from the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem Lake) to the IJ, which used to extend from the Zuiderzee all the way to Velsen. In the 13th century, a dam with locks was constructed at the mouth of the Spaarne where the village of Spaarndam then formed.

After a century of planning, Haarlem&#x27;s Lake was pumped dry in 3 years from 1850–1853 and made into a polder. The Spaarne became a branch of the Ringvaart, lost much of its flow, and became shallower.

The construction of the North Sea Canal (completed in 1876) reduced most of the IJ Bay into polders but a small canalized section of the IJ remained at Spaarndam to connect the Spaarne to the new canal.

The river was deepened for the benefit of industries along its shores.

==Places of interest along the riverbanks==
At the juncture of the river and the ringvaart is the Cruquius Museum, a museum that resides in one of the three original pumping stations from 1850. Steam engines were used to pump the water out from the Haarlemmermeer polder. On the Heemstede side of the juncture is the old Castle Heemstede. Traveling up the river towards Haarlem, on the Heemstede side the dome of the Hageveld high school and former Catholic seminary can be seen. Continuing under the bridge to Schalkwijk, on that side is windmill &quot;De Hommel&quot;, a sawmill that is often open to the public on spring and summer weekends. Across from that on the Heemstede side is rowing club &quot;K.R.Z.V. Het Spaarne&quot; and a few buildings by J.B. van Loghem, such as &quot;Tuinwijk&quot;, an early community living project sharing a garden. In the same block, entering Haarlem, is the old location of the ships architectural bureau De Voogt Naval Architects in the home of Henri de Voogt, known from Feadship. Nearing the next bridge, on the edge of the wood the Haarlemmerhout, villa Welgelegen can be seen, that once had a garden all the way to the Spaarne. Once in the center of Haarlem, many historic buildings in the centre of Haarlem, including:
*The Weigh House of Haarlem
*Hodson house
*Teylers Museum
*Teylers Hofje
*Windmill &quot;De Adriaan&quot;
*Hofje van Noblet

<text>Mary Ellen Bamford (December 10, 1857 – May 21, 1946) was an American writer from Healdsburg, California.

==Early years and education==
Mary Ellen Bamford was born in Healdsburg, California, the daughter of Dr. William Bamford and Cornelia Elizabeth Rand; her parents were pioneer settlers. In the 1850s, her father, born in Ireland, had traveled across the plains whilst Cornelia Rand had arrived by California from her native New Hampshire by sea via Cape Horn. Her parents married on February 16, 1857 in Santa Rosa, California. Mary Ellen Bamford had an older half brother, Edmund L. Bamford, from Dr. Bamford&#x27;s previous marriage, and a younger sister, Chloe L. Bamford. Mary lived in 1235 E. 15th Street, Oakland, California, in what was declared on November 17, 1981 a designated landmark, the Dr. William Bamford House. She was educated in public schools in Oakland.

==Career==
After finishing school, she spent four years working as an assistant in the Oakland Free Public Library, however writing remained her career. In 1879, famous novelist Robert Louis Stevenson was treated by Mary&#x27;s father, and visited their home frequently. As a token of gratitude for treating him and saving his life, as Stevenson claimed, in April 1880 Stevenson gave Dr. Bamford an inscribed copy of his pioneering book about outdoor literature &quot;Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes&quot;, which Mary kept for years.

Bamford was an active prohibitionist and she was also secretary of the regional &quot;Woman&#x27;s Baptist Foreign Missionary Society&quot;. She supplied books to a number of publishers including the American Baptist Publication Society. In contrast to most Americans at the time, Bamford was sympathetic to Chinese and other Asians attempting to enter the United States. Although most scholars today do not accept her claim that the Angel Island Immigration Station was &quot;the Ellis Island of the West,&quot; Bamford&#x27;s study continues to be cited today. Bamford also wrote for Sunday schools of several denominations.

By 1882, Bamford and her mother were the only members of her immediate family left, and upon her mother&#x27;s death on May 6 she was left a property in Twin Lake Park in Santa Cruz worth $7933.77 in 2017 US dollars. She died in 1946 at age 88, and her funeral services were held at the Grant D. Miller Mortuaries. Inc.

<text>FBI Assistant Director Walter Sergei Skinner is a fictional character portrayed by American actor Mitch Pileggi on &quot;The X-Files&quot; and its short-lived spin-off &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;, both broadcast on Fox.

In the science fiction-supernatural series, Skinner supervised the X-Files office, which is concerned with unresolved FBI cases of mysterious or possibly supernatural circumstances. Fox Mulder, the FBI agent in charge of the X-Files, considers the X-Files the truth behind the supposed conspiracy. Skinner was a main character in the ninth, tenth and eleventh seasons of the show and a recurring character throughout the first eight seasons.

Skinner made his first appearance in the first season 1994 episode &quot;Tooms&quot;. At the start of the series, Skinner was dismissive towards Mulder&#x27;s belief in extraterrestrial and other strange phenomena. However, throughout the series Skinner has moved on to respect and agree with Mulder, who is finally proven correct in &quot;Requiem&quot;, when Skinner sees an alien spacecraft. Skinner has received critical acclaim and has become a fan favorite.

Pileggi received the role of Walter Skinner after &quot;two or three&quot; auditions for the role. Beginning with only a small cameo, his character frequently made more appearances during the second season.

== Character arc ==
Skinner is a former Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. In the war he once killed a boy at a very short distance, an experience which has scarred him for life. He is married to Sharon Skinner. He has been treated at a sleep disorder clinic, suffering from recurring dreams of an old woman, which may either be a hallucination arising from drug use during Vietnam or a succubus. Skinner&#x27;s hobbies include jogging and boxing, the latter of which has been shown in his ability to outfight Fox Mulder and X and to defend himself reasonably well when he was attacked by Alex Krycek and his men.

Skinner took personal administrative charge of the X-Files in the latter half of Season 1, replacing Section Chief Scott Blevins. Initially, Skinner acts solely as a supervisor to Agent Mulder and Dana Scully&#x27;s investigations of the paranormal. In the early episodes, it is unclear whether he is entirely independent of his actions or controlled by men such as the &quot;Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;. Eventually, Skinner begins trusting Mulder and Scully and becomes their ally, saving both of their lives on multiple occasions. He stands up to the conspirators that tried to control him, for which he frequently pays throughout the series.

After Skinner has long broken free of the &quot;Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, he is again forced to take orders, this time from Alex Krycek. He is covertly infected with nanotechnology, which gives Krycek the leverage to control him. Two years later, Skinner is finally able to rid himself of Krycek, when during an attempt by Krycek on Mulder&#x27;s life, Skinner fatally shoots Krycek. At Mulder&#x27;s murder trial, Skinner is asked to act as Mulder&#x27;s lawyer, having become a supporter of Mulder&#x27;s cause. Later, Skinner and Deputy Director Alvin Kersh confront the &quot;Toothpick Man&quot; in Kersh&#x27;s office, after Agents John Doggett and Monica Reyes discover that the X-Files office had been emptied out. This results in another, apparently permanent, closing of the X-Files division. Six years later, with the X-Files still closed down, Skinner assists Scully in finding Mulder after he goes missing while consulting on the FBI&#x27;s investigation into the disappearance of a missing agent. Mulder and Skinner are shown to still be on friendly terms, despite Mulder&#x27;s animosity towards the FBI for the events following the trial.

== Conceptual history ==

=== Creation and development ===
The role of Walter Skinner was played by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for two or three other characters on &quot;The X-Files&quot; before getting the part. At first, the fact that he was asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles — Chris Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, due to the fact that the actor had been shaving his head. When the actor had attended the audition for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow back. Pileggi&#x27;s attitude fit well with Walter Skinner&#x27;s character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. After successfully auditioning for the role, Pileggi thought he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role of Walter Skinner.

Pileggi himself thought he got the role because of Gillian Anderson&#x27;s (who portrayed Dana Scully) pregnancy during the second season, saying the producers felt they needed to take the &quot;show in a different direction&quot; while she was pregnant. So Pileggi felt at the start that he &quot;compensated&quot; for the situation of the show, and after a while the character started to grow on the producers and fellow cast, as Pileggi puts it, &quot;the character just started kind of clicking and working&quot;. At the end of the second season, the producers wanted Pileggi to return in future episodes, so he signed a six-year contract with them.

In an interview with &quot;X-Files&quot; fan site host Robin Mayhall, Pileggi commented once that he felt David Duchovny&#x27;s (portrayed Fox Mulder) semi-departure in season eight and the introduction of Robert Patrick&#x27;s John Doggett, and the fact that he started to believe in Aliens at the end of season seven, Skinner was given the &quot;opportunity to grow&quot;, further stating &quot;new avenues&quot; had been opened. While Pileggi stated that he missed Duchovny&#x27;s presence in &quot;The X-Files&quot;, he continued saying that he did not have the opportunity to work with him during the seventh season. He even went as far as saying that there was no &quot;interaction between&quot; the two characters. He was positive to the new storyline conceived during Duchovny&#x27;s departure, saying it gave the show a &quot;shot in the arm,&quot; which reinvented the show.

=== &quot;I Want to Believe&quot; ===
As writers Carter and Frank Spotnitz aimed to avoid complicating the storyline of &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; with superfluous appearances of characters from the television series, Skinner is the only returning character in the movie. He was included in the film&#x27;s plot only when a fitting opportunity to involve him arose, and Spotnitz and Carter were very happy to write Skinner into the story. The scenes of &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; that include Skinner were filmed very late in the movie&#x27;s filming schedule, and the particular scene that acts as the character&#x27;s introduction in the movie was filmed, for reasons of time, in two different locations.

== Reception ==
The character received critical acclaim from fans and critics alike and since became a fan&#x27;s favourite of the show. Mitch Pileggi received acclaim for his portrayal of the character.

While not winning or getting nominated for any of his work alone in &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Mitch Pileggi and several other cast members were nominated in the category &quot;Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series&quot; by the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1997, 1998 and 1999 but did not win. Following the broadcast of &quot;One Breath&quot;, in which Skinner recalls serving as a US Marine during the Vietnam War, Pileggi received several fan letters from Vietnam veterans. Ben-Rawson Jones named the character of Skinner a &quot;Spy cult icon&quot; in 2008, describing him as the &quot;corporate middle man&quot;.

George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; both reacted positively to the death of Alex Krycek at the hands of Skinner, saying it was the best scene of the eighth-season finale, &quot;Existence&quot;. Another review from the same site and writers said the season eight episode, &quot;Via Negativa&quot;, said the story &quot;clicked&quot; largely thanks to Skinner along with Alvin Kersh, saying that Skinner &quot;delivered another Mulderesque&quot;. In a review of &quot;The X-Files&quot; feature film, Soren Andersen from &quot;The News Tribune&quot; said the character was &quot;underused&quot; both in the series and film. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Bruce Fretts said Skinner brought &quot;a real element of danger to the show.&quot;

<doc id="938325" wikidata="Q678021" url="?curid=938325" title="Armand de Kersaint">
<text>Armand-Guy-Simon de Coetnempren, comte de Kersaint, in short Armand de Kersaint (; 29 July 17424 December 1793), was a French sailor and politician. A Girondin, Kersaint held important naval posts during the early stages of the French Revolution.

== Biography ==
===Early life and career===
Born in Paris, Kersaint came from a noble family; his father, Guy François de Coetnempren, comte de Kersaint, was a distinguished naval officer. Armand de Kersaint joined the French Navy as a Garde-Marine on 5 September 1755. In 1757, while serving on his father&#x27;s ship, he was promoted to Ensign for his bravery in action. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 1 February 1770, and to Captain on 13 March 1779.

In July 1778, as captain of the 32-gun &quot;Iphigénie&quot;, he captured the 20-gun British post-ship . In 1782 Kersaint led an expedition to capture the British-held Dutch colonies of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice.

At the outbreak of the Revolution, Kersaint embraced reform. He adopted the new ideas, and in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Le Bon Sens&quot; (a title inspired by Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot;) attacked traditional privileges; he also submitted to the National Constituent Assembly a scheme for the reorganisation of the navy, but it was not accepted.

===In the Legislative Assembly===
On 4 January 1791 Kersaint was appointed administrator of the &quot;département&quot; of the Seine by the electoral assembly of Paris. He was also elected as a &quot;deputé suppléant&quot; to the Legislative Assembly, and was called upon to sit in it in place of a deputy who had resigned.

His main objective became the realisation of the navy scheme which he had previously submitted to the Constituent Assembly. He understood this to be made possible only through a general reform of all institutions, and subsequently gave his support to the policies of The Mountain, denouncing the conduct of King Louis XVI, and, on 10 August 1792 (after the storming of the Tuileries Palace), voting in favour of his deposition.

Shortly after, he was sent on a mission to the &quot;Armée du Centre&quot;, inspecting Soissons, Reims, Sedan and the Ardennes. While on assignment, Kersaint was arrested by the municipality of Sedan, but was set free after a few days&#x27; detention. Back in Paris, he took an active part in one of the last debates of the Legislative Assembly, in which it was decided to publish a &quot;Bulletin officiel&quot;, a report continued by the National Convention, and known by the name of the &quot;Bulletin de la Convention Nationale&quot;.

===In the National Convention===
Kersaint was sent as a deputy to the convention by the &quot;département&quot; of Seine-et-Oise in September 1792, and, on 1 January 1793, was appointed Vice admiral. He continued to devote himself to questions concerning the navy and national defense, prepared a report on the British political system and the navy, and caused a decree to be passed for the formation of a committee of general defense, which after many modifications was to become the Committee of Public Safety. In January 1793, he had also had a decree passed concerning the navy. He had, however, entered the ranks of the Girondins, and had voted in the trial of the Louis XVI against the death penalty and in favor of the appeal to the people. He resigned his seat in the convention on 20 January.

===Arrest and execution===
After the death of the king, his opposition became more marked; he denounced the September Massacres, but, when called upon to justify his attitude, confined himself to attacking Jean-Paul Marat, who had risen to immense popularity. Kersaint&#x27;s friends attempted to obtain his appointment as Minister of the Marine – he failed to obtain even a post as officer.

He was arrested on 23 September at Ville d&#x27;Avray, near Paris, and taken before the Revolutionary Tribunal, where he was accused of having conspired for the restoration of the Bourbon Monarchy, and of having insulted national representation by resigning his position in the convention. Kersaint was arrested on 2 October 1793, sentenced to death on 4 December, and guillotined that very day.

==Family==
Kersaint&#x27;s brothers, Guy-Pierre (1747–1822) and Joseph Coëtnempren de Kersaint (1746–1797), also served in the French Navy and took part in the American Revolutionary War.

<text>Jack Elton Bresenham (born October 11, 1937, Clovis, New Mexico, US) is a former professor of computer science.

==Biography==
Bresenham retired from 27 years of service at IBM as a Senior Technical Staff Member in 1987. He taught for 16 years at Winthrop University and has nine patents. He has four children.

Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm, developed in 1962, is his most well-known innovation. It determines which points on a 2-dimensional raster should be plotted in order to form a straight line between two given points, and is commonly used to draw lines on a computer screen. It is one of the earliest algorithms discovered in the field of computer graphics. The midpoint circle algorithm shares some similarities to his line algorithm and is known as &quot;Bresenham&#x27;s circle algorithm&quot;.

<text>William J. Schroeder (February 14, 1932 – August 7, 1986), was one of the first recipients of an artificial heart. Schroeder was born in Jasper, Indiana, and was a Sergeant in the United States Air Force from 1952 to 1966. On November 25, 1984, at the age of 52, became the second human recipient of the Jarvik 7. The transplant was performed at Humana Heart Institute International in Louisville, Kentucky by Dr. William C. DeVries.

==Death==
After 18 days, he suffered the first of a series of strokes, eventually leaving him in a vegetative state. He died on August 7, 1986, at 1:35PM of a lung infection, a year and 255 days (620 days) after receiving the Jarvik 7. This was the longest that anyone had survived with an artificial heart at that time.

The headstone marking Schroeder&#x27;s grave is made of black granite in the shape of two overlapping hearts. One is laser engraved with an image of the Jarvik 7.

<text>François Chabot (; 23 October 1756 – 5 April 1794) was a French politician.

==Early life==
Born in Saint-Geniez-d&#x27;Olt (Aveyron), Chabot became a Capuchin friar in Rodez before the French Revolution, while continuing to be attracted to the works of &quot;philosophes&quot; - the reason for which he was banned from preaching in the respective diocese.

After the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, he got married and continued to act as constitutional priest, becoming grand vicar of Henri Grégoire, bishop of Blois; he was also the founder of the Jacobin Club in Rodez. He was later elected to the Legislative Assembly, sitting at the far left, and forming with Claude Bazire and Antoine Christophe Merlin the &quot;Cordelier Trio&quot;.

==Convention==

Re-elected to the National Convention for the &quot;département&quot; of Loir-et-Cher, he voted for the execution of King Louis XVI, and opposed the proposal to prosecute the authors of the September Massacres, as there were heroes of the Battle of Jemappes among them.

In March 1793, Chabot arrived in Aveyron as one of two Representatives-on-mission to the department of Aveyron and the Tarn, the other being Jean-Baptiste Bô. As their first act, Chabot and Bô instituted a special commission for military recruitment from the region. Several days later, a war tax was instituted on the aristocrats and wealthy bourgeois. In an attempt to quell the specter of urban revolts (seen as parts of a single movement, and labelled by the Parisians as &quot;federalism&quot;), the two proceeded to suspend the democratic system, reserving the right to suspend or dismiss officials lacking in &#x27;civic zeal&#x27;. Combined with crackdowns on local churches and the lifting of restrictions on governmental search and seizure, Chabot and Bô were infamous as two of the most activist Representatives-on-Mission in the country. On 5 May 1793, Chabot and Bô left their Aveyron commission; Chabot was reassigned to Toulouse, where his administration was quite similar.

In November 1793, François Chabot was denounced by several members of the Convention, notably Fabre d&#x27;Eglantine, Jacques-René Hébert and Louis Pierre Dufourny de Villiers, on the grounds that he had attempted to falsify the finances of the French East India Company, offering bribes to various elected representatives in the process. Chabot claimed to Robespierre that he had been, of his own initiative, infiltrating a pre-existing plot to meddle with the finances of the French East India Company. The plot, Chabot claimed, was hatched by the known royalist, the Baron de Batz, with Hebert, Dufourny, and Claude Basire, a fellow Cordelier, as key accomplices, with the plot’s ultimate originator being William Pitt. Robespierre allowed Chabot to present his case before the Committee for Public Safety, from which he had been removed on suspicion of corruption one month earlier.

Little evidence was brought against Chabot in the counter-denunciation; the greater part of Dufourny’s speech on the floor concerned Chabot’s marriage to Leopoldine Frey, sister to Austrian-Jewish banker Junius Frey. Her nationality, along with the substantial dowry which Chabot received, was key in the discrediting of Chabot’s testimony. To quote Dufourney&#x27;s testimony:
In Dufourny&#x27;s version of the East India scandal, Chabot and his close associates were working with the Baron de Batz, who had previously been accused of offering a bounty for the rescue of Marie Antoinette, on behalf of members of the Austrian royalty. Batz had proposed turning Chabot and other leading figures of the Revolution against each other by using or fabricating financial conflicts.

==Execution==
Compromised both in the falsification of the decree suppressing the East India Company and in the plot to bribe certain members of the Convention, Chabot was arrested and brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal. He was sentenced to death and guillotined at the same time as the Dantonists, who protested their association with a &quot;fripon&quot; (&quot;loafer&quot;).

Claude Basire and Fabre d&#x27;Eglantine, accused by Chabot of involvement in the East India Company Scandal, and Chabot&#x27;s brother-in-law Junius Frey were also executed alongside him.

==Quotes==
*Christ was the first &quot;sans-culotte&quot;.
*&quot;What is my law, you ask? I answer: the natural law, the one saying: Poor people, seek the rich; girls, seek the boys. Follow your instincts&quot;.

<text>Claude Basire (; 1764 – 5 April 1794) was a French politician of the Revolutionary period. He was guillotined.

==Biography==
Born in Dijon, he became a deputy for the Côte-d&#x27;Or in the Legislative Assembly, he made himself prominent by denouncing the Bourbon and the Tuileries Palace&#x27;s &quot;comité autrichien&quot; (“Austrian committee”, the purported Royalist group supporting the Austrians with whom the country was at war). On 20 June 1792, he spoke in favor of the deposition of King Louis XVI, though on 20 September he advised discussion before moving to decide in favour of abolition.

Elected to the National Convention, he affiliated with The Mountain, opposing the adjournment of the king&#x27;s trial, and voting in favor of his execution. He joined the attack upon the Girondists, but, as member of the Committee of General Security, he condemned the Reign of Terror.

He was implicated by François Chabot in the falsification of a decree relative to the East India Company. Although his involvement seems only to have been that he failed to reveal the plot – of which he knew only part – he was nonetheless accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal at the same time as Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins. He is memorialized by the street name Rue Claude Basire in central Dijon.

<text>Gustav Torgny Lindgren (16 June 1938 – 16 March 2017) was a Swedish writer.

Lindgren was the son of Andreas Lindgren and Helga Björk. He studied in Umeå to become a teacher and worked as a teacher until the middle of the 1970s. For several years he was active as a local politician for the Swedish Social Democratic Party. In the 1980s he converted to the Catholic faith.

Lindgren began as a poet in 1965 but had to wait until 1982 for his breakthrough, with the novel &quot;The Way of a Serpent&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Ormens väg på hälleberget&quot;). Lindgren&#x27;s work was translated into more than thirty languages and was one of Sweden&#x27;s most internationally successful contemporary writers. He became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1991.

==&quot;The Way of a Serpent&quot;==
&quot;The Way of a Serpent&quot; tells the story of a farmer family in a poverty-stricken region in the northern parts of Sweden in the nineteenth century. The family formerly owned its land but had to sell it cheap during a succession of years of famine. The new owner collects his rent as long as there is money in the household, and exploits the women when there is no money.

The novel was made into a film by Bo Widerberg in 1986.

<doc id="938372" wikidata="Q205602" url="?curid=938372" title="President of Azerbaijan">
<text>The president of the Republic of Azerbaijan is the head of state of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Constitution states that the president is the embodiment of executive power, commander-in-chief, &quot;representative of Azerbaijan in home and foreign policies&quot;, and &quot;shall have the right of immunity [from prosecution].&quot; The president rules through his executive office, the Presidential Administration, consisting of a group of secretaries and departmental ministers. Additionally, there is a Cabinet of Ministers regarding economic and social policy and a Security Council regarding foreign, military, and judicial matters.

The primary workplace is the presidential building (also known as the presidential apparatus) on Istiglaliyyat Street in Baku. Ilham Aliyev, son of the former president, Heydar, was elected the 4th and current president on 31 October 2003 after his father&#x27;s resignation due to his deteriorating health.

==Selection process and term==
===Eligibility===
Candidates for the position must be Azerbaijani citizens without age restrictions and have lived in Azerbaijan for at least 10 years. According to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, the same person can be on the post of President an unlimited number of terms.

===Election===
Each faction in the National Assembly has the right to nominate a candidate for the presidential elections. The minimum number of signatures for a presidential candidate fielded by a political party with no parliamentary representation is 40,000, before amendments to the law.

===Term of office===
Prior to 2009, the term of office was five years, with a maximum of two terms. A referendum in 2009 removed the limit on the number of terms, and in 2016, another referendum increased the term to seven years. According to the Azerbaijani administration, a longer term would provide for more continuity in decision-making. The Venice Commission, of which Azerbaijan is a member, warned that this and other provisions of the referendum gave &quot;unprecedented&quot; authority to the president, and could severely upset the balance of power.

=== Inauguration ===
The official inauguration ceremony of the president is not publicly held, occurring with the participation of officials of the Azerbaijan state (representatives of political parties, public organizations, military personnel, religious figures), members of the government, deputies of the National Assembly, members of the president&#x27;s family, as well as foreign representatives and other invited guests.

It is held within three days after the confirmation of the elected president by the Constitutional Court, during which the president takes the following oath:

Then the person elected president of Azerbaijan puts his right hand on the Koran and takes the following oath:

Then the president-elect of Azerbaijan bows and kisses the Azerbaijani flag. The ceremony ends with a speech by the president-elect of Azerbaijan. The following is a list of presidential inaugurations:
==Powers and duties==
===Guarantor of the Constitution===
As the guarantor of the Constitution and the entire system of constitutional law, the president ensures that the constitutions, laws and regulations of the constituent territories of the Azerbaijan be in full compliance with the country&#x27;s Constitution and federal laws.

===Foreign policy===
The president is invested with extensive rights to implement the state&#x27;s foreign policy. The president determines Azerbaijan&#x27;s position in international affairs and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs ratification documents.

=== Military policy ===
The president serves as the supreme commander-in-chief of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces. In this capacity, he has the power to declare a martial law.

== Agencies under the president ==

=== Presidential Administration ===
The Office of the President of Azerbaijan is the executive administration of the president, and is in charge of fulfilling the constitutional responsibilities of the president. The headquarters of office is located on Istiglaliyyat Street in Baku. It is currently headed by Samir Nuriyev.

=== Security Council ===

The Security Council (&quot;Təhlükəsizlik Şurası&quot;) is an advisory body to the president, established on 10 April 1997. The Security Council ensures the creation of conditions for the President to exercise his constitutional powers in the field of security. The chairman of the Security Council under the president of Azerbaijan is the president of Azerbaijan. The following people are members of the council:

Chief military advisors to the president of Azerbaijan have included Nuraddin Sadigov (1993–1999), Tofig Aghahuseynov (1997–2002) and National Security Vahid Aliyev (since April 2002).

== Symbols ==
=== Standard ===

After the oath of office has been taken by the elected president, the standard is handed over to the president. These devices are used to display the rank of his office and are used on special occasions. The standard is a square version of the Azerbaijani flag, charged in the center with the Azerbaijani coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Azerbaijan. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Azerbaijan president.

=== Military flag ===
The flag of the supreme commander-in-chief of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces was approved by the decree of President Ilham Aliyev on 11 April 2019. The flag of the supreme commander-in-chief is the official military symbol of the president of Azerbaijan, with the original being kept in the service room of the president located in the Presidential Palace. It resembles the army flag but with the words &quot;Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan&quot;.

=== Badge ===

The badge of the president (Prezidentinin döş nişanı) was approved by decree on September 15, 2008. It is in the shape of an octagonal star made of 18 carat gold, placed in a circle with a diameter. In the center is a mined image of the State Emblem of Azerbaijan, which is surrounded by two rings and 60 diamonds are lined up between the rings.

==Residences==
The main (since 2008) presidential residence is &quot;Zagulba&quot; (). Also, the president has several part-time residences outside of Baku:

* Youth Presidential Palace
* Presidential Mountain Palace in Qabala
* &quot;Freedom&quot; Guest House
* Palace of Happiness
* Gulustan Palace
* Presidential Library
* &quot;Marxal&quot; Treatment and Recreation Complex

As well as several vacation residences:
* &quot;Novkhani&quot; (), Novkhani, Absheron Rayon
* &quot;Khoshbulaq&quot; (), Daşkəsən, Dashkasan District
*Göy Saray in Baku
*Vahdat Presidential Summer Palace in Shamakhi
*&quot;Ulduz&quot; Guest House
* &quot;Youth&quot; Guest House

==Transport and security==

National transport services for the Azerbaijan president are provided by the Special Purpose Garage, which is a unit within the Special State Protection Service.
* Limousines
** Maybach 62
** Mercedes-Benz W221
*Honorary escort (motorcycles)
** BMW
* Airplanes for long-distance travel
* Boeing 767-300ER 4K-AI01 &quot;Baku-1&quot; Main aircraft
* Airbus A319-100 4K-AI02 &quot;Baku-2&quot;
*Gulfstream G550 4K-AI06

The presidential aircraft uses the same colour scheme as standard AZAL aircraft, except for the use of the Azerbaijan coat of arms or the Presidential Standard on the empennage instead of the flag of Azerbaijan.

<doc id="938385" wikidata="Q998319" url="?curid=938385" title="Flight recorder">
<text>A flight recorder is an electronic recording device placed in an aircraft for the purpose of facilitating the investigation of aviation accidents and incidents. The device may often be referred to colloquially as a &quot;black box&quot;, an outdated name which has become a misnomer—they are now required to be painted bright orange, to aid in their recovery after accidents.

There are two types of flight recording devices: the flight data recorder (FDR) preserves the recent history of the flight through the recording of dozens of parameters collected several times per second; the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) preserves the recent history of the sounds in the cockpit, including the conversation of the pilots. The two devices may be combined into a single unit. Together, the FDR and CVR objectively document the aircraft&#x27;s flight history, which may assist in any later investigation.

The two flight recorders are required by international regulation, overseen by the International Civil Aviation Organization, to be capable of surviving the conditions likely to be encountered in a severe aircraft accident. For this reason, they are typically specified to withstand an impact of 3400 &quot;g&quot; and temperatures of over , as required by EUROCAE ED-112. They have been a mandatory requirement in commercial aircraft in the United States since 1967. After the unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014, commentators have called for live streaming of data to the ground, as well as extending the battery life of the underwater locator beacons.

== History ==

In seafaring, a device which recorded the position of different vessels in case of an accident was patented by John Sen Inches Thomson in January, 1897. 

=== Early designs ===
One of the earliest and proven attempts was made by François Hussenot and Paul Beaudouin in 1939 at the Marignane flight test center, France, with their &quot;type HB&quot; flight recorder; they were essentially photograph-based flight recorders, because the record was made on a scrolling photographic film long by wide. The latent image was made by a thin ray of light deviated by a mirror tilted according to the magnitude of the data to be recorded (altitude, speed, etc.). A pre-production run of 25 &quot;HB&quot; recorders was ordered in 1941 and HB recorders remained in use in French flight test centers well into the 1970s.

In 1947, Hussenot founded the Société Française des Instruments de Mesure with Beaudouin and another associate, so as to market his invention, which was also known as the &quot;hussenograph&quot;. This company went on to become a major supplier of data recorders, used not only aboard aircraft but also trains and other vehicles. SFIM is today part of the Safran group and is still present in the flight recorder market. The advantage of the film technology was that it could be easily developed afterwards and provides a durable, visual feedback of the flight parameters without needing any playback device. On the other hand, unlike magnetic tapes or later flash memory-based technology, a photographic film cannot be erased and reused, and so must be changed periodically. The technology was reserved for one-shot uses, mostly during planned test flights: it was not mounted aboard civilian aircraft during routine commercial flights. Also, cockpit conversation was not recorded.

Another form of flight data recorder was developed in the UK during World War II. Len Harrison and Vic Husband developed a unit that could withstand a crash and fire to keep the flight data intact. The unit was the forerunner of today&#x27;s recorders, in being able to withstand conditions that aircrew could not. It used copper foil as the recording medium, with various styli, corresponding to various instruments or aircraft controls, indenting the foil. The foil was periodically advanced at set time intervals, giving a history of the aircraft&#x27;s instrument readings and control settings. The unit was developed at Farnborough for the Ministry of Aircraft Production. At the war&#x27;s end the Ministry got Harrison and Husband to sign over their invention to it and the Ministry patented it under British patent 19330/45.

The first modern flight data recorder, called &quot;Mata-Hari&quot;, was created in 1942 by Finnish aviation engineer Veijo Hietala. This black high-tech mechanical box was able to record all required data during test flights of fighter aircraft that the Finnish Air Force repaired or built in its main aviation factory in Tampere, Finland.

During World War II both British and American air forces successfully experimented with aircraft voice recorders. In August 1943 the USAAF conducted an experiment with a magnetic wire recorder to capture the inter-phone conversations of a B-17 bomber flight crew on a combat mission over Nazi-occupied France. The recording was broadcast back to the United States by radio two days afterwards.

=== Australian designs ===

In 1953, while working at the Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL) of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in Melbourne, Australian research scientist David Warren conceived a device that would record not only the instrument readings, but also the voices in the cockpit. In 1954 he published a report entitled &quot;A Device for Assisting Investigation into Aircraft Accidents&quot;.

Warren built a prototype FDR called &quot;The ARL Flight Memory Unit&quot; in 1956, and in 1958 he built the first combined FDR/CVR prototype. It was designed with civilian aircraft in mind, explicitly for post-crash examination purposes. Aviation authorities from around the world were largely uninterested at first, but this changed in 1958 when Sir Robert Hardingham, the secretary of the British Air Registration Board, visited the ARL and was introduced to David Warren. Hardingham realized the significance of the invention and arranged for Warren to demonstrate the prototype in the UK.

The ARL assigned an engineering team to help Warren develop the prototype to the airborne stage. The team, consisting of electronics engineers Lane Sear, Wally Boswell, and Ken Fraser, developed a working design that incorporated a fire-resistant and shockproof case, a reliable system for encoding and recording aircraft instrument readings and voice on one wire, and a ground-based decoding device. The ARL system, made by the British firm of S. Davall &amp; Sons Ltd, in Middlesex, was named the &quot;Red Egg&quot; because of its shape and bright red color.

The units were redesigned in 1965 and relocated at the rear of aircraft to increase the probability of successful data retrieval after a crash.

Carriage of data recording equipment became mandatory in UK-registered aircraft in two phases; the first, for new turbine-engined public transport category aircraft over in weight, was mandated in 1965, with a further requirement in 1966 for piston-engined transports over , with the earlier requirement further extended to all jet transports. One of the first UK uses of the data recovered from an aircraft accident was that recovered from the Royston &quot;Midas&quot; data recorder that was on board the British Midland Argonaut involved in the Stockport Air Disaster in 1967.

===American designs===
A flight recorder was invented and patented in the United States by James J. Ryan. Ryan&#x27;s &quot;Flight Recorder&quot; patent was filed in August 1953 and approved on November 8, 1960, as US Patent 2,959,459. A second patent by Ryan for a &quot;Coding Apparatus For Flight Recorders&quot; is US Patent 3,075,192 dated January 22, 1963.

A &quot;Cockpit Sound Recorder&quot; (CSR) was independently invented and patented by Edmund A. Boniface Jr., an aeronautical engineer at Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. He originally filed with the US Patent Office on February 2, 1961, as an &quot;Aircraft Cockpit Sound Recorder&quot;. The 1961 invention was viewed by some as an &quot;invasion of privacy&quot;. Subsequently, Boniface filed again on February 4, 1963, for a &quot;Cockpit Sound Recorder&quot; (US Patent 3,327,067) with the addition of a spring-loaded switch which allowed the pilot to erase the audio/sound tape recording at the conclusion of a safe flight and landing.

Boniface&#x27;s participation in aircraft crash investigations in the 1940s and in the accident investigations of the loss of one of the wings at cruise altitude on each of two Lockheed Electra turboprop powered aircraft (Flight 542 operated by Braniff Airlines in 1959 and Flight 710 operated by Northwest Orient Airlines in 1961) led to his wondering what the pilots may have said just prior to the wing loss and during the descent as well as the type and nature of any sounds or explosions that may have preceded or occurred during the wing loss.

His patent was for a device for recording audio of pilot remarks and engine or other sounds to be &quot;contained with the in-flight recorder within a sealed container that is shock mounted, fireproofed and made watertight&quot; and &quot;sealed in such a manner as to be capable of withstanding extreme temperatures during a crash fire&quot;. The CSR was an analog device which provided a continuous erasing/recording loop (lasting 30 or more minutes) of all sounds (explosion, voice, and the noise of any aircraft structural components undergoing serious fracture and breakage) which could be overheard in the cockpit.

On November 1, 1966, the director of the Bureau of Safety of the Civil Aeronautics Board Bobbie R. Allen and the chief of Technical Services Section John S. Leak presented &quot;The Potential Role of Flight Recorders in Aircraft Accident Investigation&quot; at the AIAA/CASI Joint Meeting on Aviation Safety, Toronto, Canada.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;black box&quot; was a World War II British phrase, originating with the development of radio, radar, and electronic navigational aids in British and Allied combat aircraft. These often-secret electronic devices were encased in non-reflective black boxes or housings.  The earliest identified reference to &quot;black boxes&quot; occurs in a May 1945 &quot;Flight&quot; article, &quot;Radar for Airlines&quot;, describing the application of wartime RAF radar and navigational aids to civilian aircraft: &quot;The stowage of the &#x27;black boxes&#x27; and, even more important, the detrimental effect on performance of external aerials, still remain as a radio and radar problem.&quot; (The term &quot;black box&quot; is used with a different meaning in science and engineering, describing a system exclusively by its inputs and outputs, with no information whatsoever about its inner workings.)

Magnetic tape and wire voice recorders had been tested on RAF and USAAF bombers by 1943 thus adding to the assemblage of fielded and experimental electronic devices employed on Allied aircraft. As early as 1944 aviation writers envisioned use of these recording devices on commercial aircraft to aid incident investigations. When modern flight recorders were proposed to the British Aeronautical Research Council in 1958, the term &quot;black box&quot; was in colloquial use by experts.

By 1967, when flight recorders were mandated by leading aviation countries, the expression had found its way into general use: &quot;These so-called &#x27;black boxes&#x27; are, in fact, of fluorescent flame-orange in colour.&quot; The formal names of the devices are &quot;flight data recorder&quot; and &quot;cockpit voice recorder&quot;. The recorders must be housed in boxes that are bright orange in color to make them more visually conspicuous in the debris after an accident.

== Components ==

=== Flight data recorder ===



A flight data recorder (FDR; also ADR, for &quot;accident data recorder&quot;) is an electronic device employed to record instructions sent to any electronic systems on an aircraft.

The data recorded by the FDR are used for accident and incident investigation. Due to their importance in investigating accidents, these ICAO-regulated devices are carefully engineered and constructed to withstand the force of a high speed impact and the heat of an intense fire. Contrary to the popular term &quot;black box&quot;, the exterior of the FDR is coated with heat-resistant bright orange paint for high visibility in wreckage, and the unit is usually mounted in the aircraft&#x27;s tail section, where it is more likely to survive a crash. Following an accident, the recovery of the FDR is usually a high priority for the investigating body, as analysis of the recorded parameters can often detect and identify causes or contributing factors.

Modern day FDRs receive inputs via specific data frames from the flight-data acquisition units. They record significant flight parameters, including the control and actuator positions, engine information and time of day. There are 88 parameters required as a minimum under current US federal regulations (only 29 were required until 2002), but some systems monitor many more variables. Generally each parameter is recorded a few times per second, though some units store &quot;bursts&quot; of data at a much higher frequency if the data begin to change quickly. Most FDRs record approximately 17–25 hours of data in a continuous loop. It is required by regulations that an FDR verification check (readout) is performed annually in order to verify that all mandatory parameters are recorded. Many aircraft today are equipped with an &quot;event&quot; button in the cockpit that could be activated by the crew if an abnormality occurs in flight. Pushing the button places a signal on the recording, marking the time of the event.

Modern FDRs are typically double wrapped in strong corrosion-resistant stainless steel or titanium, with high-temperature insulation inside. Modern FDRs are accompanied by an underwater locator beacon that emits an ultrasonic &quot;ping&quot; to aid in detection when submerged. These beacons operate for up to 30 days and are able to operate while immersed to a depth of up to .

=== Cockpit voice recorder ===

A cockpit voice recorder (CVR) is a flight recorder used to record the audio environment in the flight deck of an aircraft for the purpose of investigation of accidents and incidents. This is typically achieved by recording the signals of the microphones and earphones of the pilots&#x27; headsets and of an area microphone in the roof of the cockpit. The current applicable FAA TSO is C123b titled Cockpit Voice Recorder Equipment.

Where an aircraft is required to carry a CVR and uses digital communications the CVR is required to record such communications with air traffic control unless this is recorded elsewhere. it is an FAA requirement that the recording duration is a minimum of two hours. The European Aviation Safety Agency increased the recording duration to 25 hours in 2021. In 2023, the FAA proposed extending requirements to 25 hours to help in investigations like runway incursions. In a January 2024 press conference on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chair Jennifer Homendy again called for extending retention to 25 hours, rather than the currently-mandated 2 hours, on all existing devices, rather than only newly manufactured ones.

A standard CVR is capable of recording four channels of audio data for a period of two hours. The original requirement was for a CVR to record for 30 minutes, but this has been found to be insufficient in many cases because significant parts of the audio data needed for a subsequent investigation occurred more than 30 minutes before the end of the recording.

The earliest CVRs used analog wire recording, later replaced by analog magnetic tape. Some of the tape units used two reels, with the tape automatically reversing at each end. The original was the ARL Flight Memory Unit produced in 1957 by Australian David Warren and instrument maker Tych Mirfield.

Other units used a single reel, with the tape spliced into a continuous loop, much as in an 8-track cartridge. The tape would circulate and old audio information would be overwritten every 30 minutes. Recovery of sound from magnetic tape often proves difficult if the recorder is recovered from water and its housing has been breached. Thus, the latest designs employ solid-state memory and use fault tolerant digital recording techniques, making them much more resistant to shock, vibration and moisture. With the reduced power requirements of solid-state recorders, it is now practical to incorporate a battery in the units, so that recording can continue until flight termination, even if the aircraft electrical system fails.

Like the FDR, the CVR is typically mounted in the rear of the airplane fuselage to maximize the likelihood of its survival in a crash.

=== Combined units ===
With the advent of digital recorders, the FDR and CVR can be manufactured in one fireproof, shock proof, and waterproof container as a combined digital cockpit voice and data recorder (CVDR). Currently, CVDRs are manufactured by L3Harris Technologies and Hensoldt among others.

Solid state recorders became commercially practical in 1990, having the advantage of not requiring scheduled maintenance and making the data easier to retrieve. This was extended to the two-hour voice recording in 1995.

=== Additional equipment ===
Since the 1970s, most large civil jet transports have been additionally equipped with a &quot;quick access recorder&quot; (QAR). This records data on a removable storage medium. Access to the FDR and CVR is necessarily difficult because they must be fitted where they are most likely to survive an accident; they also require specialized equipment to read the recording. The QAR recording medium is readily removable and is designed to be read by equipment attached to a standard desktop computer. In many airlines, the quick access recordings are scanned for &quot;events&quot;, an event being a significant deviation from normal operational parameters. This allows operational problems to be detected and eliminated before an accident or incident results.

A flight-data acquisition unit (FDAU) is a unit that receives various discrete, analog and digital parameters from a number of sensors and avionic systems and then routes them to the FDR and, if installed, to the QAR. Information from the FDAU to the FDR is sent via specific data frames, which depend on the aircraft manufacturer.

Many modern aircraft systems are digital or digitally controlled. Very often, the digital system will include built-in test equipment which records information about the operation of the system. This information may also be accessed to assist with the investigation of an accident or incident.

== Specifications ==

The design of today&#x27;s FDR is governed by the internationally recognized standards and recommended practices relating to flight recorders which are contained in ICAO Annex 6 which makes reference to industry crashworthiness and fire protection specifications such as those to be found in the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment documents EUROCAE ED55, ED56 Fiken A and ED112 (Minimum Operational Performance Specification for Crash Protected Airborne Recorder Systems). In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates all aspects of US aviation, and cites design requirements in their Technical Standard Order, based on the EUROCAE documents (as do the aviation authorities of many other countries).

Currently, EUROCAE specifies that a recorder must be able to withstand an acceleration of 3400 &quot;g&quot; (33 km/s2) for 6.5 milliseconds. This is roughly equivalent to an impact velocity of and a deceleration or crushing distance of . Additionally, there are requirements for penetration resistance, static crush, high and low temperature fires, deep sea pressure, sea water immersion, and fluid immersion.

EUROCAE ED-112 (Minimum Operational Performance Specification for Crash Protected Airborne Recorder Systems) defines the minimum specification to be met for all aircraft requiring flight recorders for recording of flight data, cockpit audio, images and CNS / ATM digital messages and used for investigations of accidents or incidents. When issued in March 2003, ED-112 superseded previous ED-55 and ED-56A that were separate specifications for FDR and CVR. FAA TSOs for FDR and CVR reference ED-112 for characteristics common to both types.

In order to facilitate recovery of the recorder from an aircraft accident site, they are required to be coloured bright yellow or orange with reflective surfaces. All are lettered &quot;Flight recorder do not open&quot; on one side in English and &quot;Enregistreur de vol ne pas ouvrir&quot; in French on the other side. To assist recovery from submerged sites they must be equipped with an underwater locator beacon which is automatically activated in the event of an accident.

== Regulation ==
The first regulatory attempt to require flight data recorders occurred in April 1941, when the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) required flight recorders on passenger aircraft that would record the aircraft&#x27;s altitude and whether the radio transmitter was turned on or off. The compliance deadline for that regulation was extended several times, until June 1944 when the requirement was rescinded due to maintenance problems and the lack of parts due to World War 2. A similar regulation was adopted in September 1947, which required recorders in aircraft of or more, but that requirement was again rescinded in July 1948 because of a lack of availability of reliable devices. In August 1957, the CAB adopted amendments to flight regulations that required the installation of flight recorders by July 1958 in all aircraft over and that were operated at altitudes over 25,000 feet. The requirements were further amended in September 1959, requiring the retention of records for 60 days, and the operation of the flight recorders continuously from the time of takeoff roll to the completion of the landing roll.

In the investigation of the 1960 crash of Trans Australia Airlines Flight 538 at Mackay, Queensland, the inquiry judge strongly recommended that flight recorders be installed in all Australian airliners. Australia became the first country in the world to make cockpit-voice recording compulsory.

The United States&#x27; first cockpit voice recorder rules were passed in 1964, requiring all turbine and piston aircraft with four or more engines to have CVRs by March 1, 1967. it is an FAA requirement that the CVR recording duration is a minimum of two hours, following the NTSB recommendation that it should be increased from its previously mandated 30-minute duration. From 2014 the United States requires flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders on aircraft that have 20 or more passenger seats, or those that have six or more passenger seats, are turbine-powered, and require two pilots.

For US air carriers and manufacturers, the NTSB is responsible for investigating accidents and safety-related incidents. The NTSB also serves in an advisory role for many international investigations not under its formal jurisdiction. The NTSB does not have regulatory authority, but must depend on legislation and other government agencies to act on its safety recommendations. In addition, after the public outcry that followed recordings released for the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 in 1988, 49 USC Section 1114(c) prohibits the NTSB from making the audio recordings public except when related to a safety investigation, and in such cases the release is only in the form of a written transcript.

The ARINC Standards are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC). The 700 Series of standards describe the form, fit, and function of avionics equipment installed predominately on transport category aircraft. The FDR is defined by ARINC Characteristic 747. The CVR is defined by ARINC Characteristic 757.

Post-incident overwriting of voice data by Nigerian crews led to a 2023 All Operators Letter reinforcing that this practice is forbidden.

=== Proposed requirements ===

==== Deployable recorders ====
The NTSB recommended in 1999 that operators be required to install two sets of CVDR systems, with the second CVDR designed to be ejected from the aircraft prior to impact with the ground or water. Ejection would be initiated by computer based on sensor information indicating an accident is imminent. A deployable recorder combines the cockpit voice/flight data recorders and an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) in a single unit. The unit would be designed to eject and float away from the aircraft and survive its descent to the ground, or float on water indefinitely. It would be equipped with satellite technology to aid in prompt recovery. Deployable CVDR technology has been used by the US Navy since 1993.

While the recommendations would involve a massive, expensive retrofit program, government funding would meet cost objections from manufacturers and airlines. Operators would get both sets of recorders (including the currently-used fixed recorder) free of charge. The cost of the second deployable/ejectable CVDR (or black box) was estimated at US$30 million for installation in 500 new aircraft (about $60,000 per new commercial plane).

In the United States, the proposed SAFE Act calls for implementing the NTSB 1999 recommendations. However, so far the proposed legislation has failed to pass Congress, having been introduced in 2003 (H.R. 2632), in 2005 (H.R. 3336), and in 2007 (H.R. 4336). Originally the Safe Aviation Flight Enhancement (SAFE) Act of 2003 was introduced on June 26, 2003, by Congressman David Price (D-NC) and Congressman John Duncan (R-Tenn.) in a bipartisan effort to ensure investigators have access to information immediately following accidents to transport category aircraft.

On July 19, 2005, a revised proposal for a SAFE Act was introduced and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the US House of Representatives. The bill was referred to the House Subcommittee on Aviation during the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses.

==== After Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ====
In the United States, on March 12, 2014, in response to the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, David Price re-introduced the SAFE Act in the US House of Representatives.

The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 demonstrated the limits of the contemporary flight recorder technology, namely how physical possession of the flight recorder device is necessary to help investigate the cause of an aircraft incident. Considering the advances of modern communication, technology commentators called for flight recorders to be supplemented or replaced by a system that provides &quot;live streaming&quot; of data from the aircraft to the ground. Furthermore, commentators called for the underwater locator beacon&#x27;s range and battery life to be extended, as well as the outfitting of civil aircraft with the deployable flight recorders typically used in military aircraft. Previous to MH370, the investigators of 2009 Air France Flight 447 urged that the battery life be extended as &quot;rapidly as possible&quot; after the crash&#x27;s flight recorders went unrecovered for over a year.

==== After Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 ====
On December 28, 2014, Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, en route from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, crashed in bad weather, killing all 155 passengers and seven crew on board.

On January 8, 2015, before the recovery of the flight recorders, an anonymous ICAO representative said: &quot;The time has come that deployable recorders are going to get a serious look.&quot; A second ICAO official said that public attention had &quot;galvanized momentum in favour of ejectable recorders on commercial aircraft&quot;.

==== Boeing 737 MAX ====
Live flight data streaming as on the Boeing 777F ecoDemonstrator, plus 20 minutes of data before and after a triggering event, could have removed the uncertainty before the Boeing 737 MAX groundings following the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash. In the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident, the Cockpit Voice Recorder functioned properly but the data was overwritten as the CVR remained powered, and functioning. The critical accident data was overwritten by over two hours of post-incident sounds until a maintenance crew could enter the aircraft after the incident and power down the CVR.

==== Image recorders ====
The NTSB has asked for the installation of cockpit image recorders in large transport aircraft to provide information that would supplement existing CVR and FDR data in accident investigations. They have recommended that image recorders be placed into smaller aircraft that are not required to have a CVR or FDR. The rationale is that what is seen on an instrument by the pilots of an aircraft is not necessarily the same as the data sent to the display device. This is particularly true of aircraft equipped with electronic displays (CRT or LCD). A mechanical instrument panel is likely to preserve its last indications, but this is not the case with an electronic display. Such systems, estimated to cost less than $8,000 installed, typically consist of a camera and microphone located in the cockpit to continuously record cockpit instrumentation, the outside viewing area, engine sounds, radio communications, and ambient cockpit sounds. As with conventional CVRs and FDRs, data from such a system is stored in a crash-protected unit to ensure survivability. Since the recorders can sometimes be crushed into unreadable pieces, or even located in deep water, some modern units are self-ejecting (taking advantage of kinetic energy at impact to separate themselves from the aircraft) and also equipped with radio emergency locator transmitters and sonar underwater locator beacons to aid in their location.

<doc id="938388" wikidata="Q124234" url="?curid=938388" title="St James's">
<text>St James&#x27;s is a central district in the City of Westminster, London, forming part of the West End. The area was once part of the northwestern gardens and parks of St. James&#x27;s Palace. During the Restoration in the 17th century, the area was developed as a residential location for the British aristocracy, and around the 19th century was the focus of the development of their gentlemen&#x27;s clubs. Once part of the parish of St Martin in the Fields, much of it formed the parish of St James from 1685 to 1922. Since the Second World War the area has transitioned from residential to commercial use.

St James&#x27;s is bounded to the north by Piccadilly and Mayfair, to the west by Green Park, to the south by The Mall and St. James&#x27;s Park, and to the east by Haymarket.

==Toponymy==
The area&#x27;s name is derived from the dedication of a 12th-century leper hospital to Saint James the Less. The hospital site is now occupied by St James&#x27;s Palace. The area became known as &quot;Clubland&quot; because of the historic presence of gentlemen&#x27;s clubs.

The section of Regent Street (colloquially known as &#x27;Lower Regent Street&#x27;) that runs between Waterloo Place and Piccadilly Circus has been officially renamed &#x27;Regent Street St James&#x27;s&#x27;.

==Urban development==

St James&#x27;s was once part of the same royal park as Green Park and St. James&#x27;s Park. In the 1660s, Charles II gave the right to develop the area to Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans who developed it as a predominantly aristocratic residential area around a grid of streets centred on St James&#x27;s Square. Until the Second World War, St James&#x27;s remained one of the most exclusive residential enclaves in London. Notable residences include St James&#x27;s Palace, Clarence House, Marlborough House, Lancaster House, Spencer House, Schomberg House, Norfolk House and Bridgewater House.

==Governance==
===Historical===
St James&#x27;s was in the ancient parish of St Martin in the Fields in the Liberty of Westminster. Attempts made in 1664, 1668 and 1670 to separate St James&#x27;s from the parish were resisted by St Martin&#x27;s vestry. The building of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly in 1684 forced the issue, and a new parish of St James within the Liberty of Westminster was created in 1685. The parish stretched from Oxford Street in the north to Pall Mall in the south. It roughly corresponded to the contemporary St James&#x27;s area, but extended into parts of Soho and Mayfair. Land south of Pall Mall remained in St Martin in the Fields&#x27; parish, and St James&#x27;s Park was split between the parishes of St Martin and St Margaret. St James&#x27;s Palace was an extra-parochial area and not part of any parish. A select vestry was created for the new parish.

===Local government===
For elections to Westminster City Council, the area is part of the St James&#x27;s ward. The ward includes Covent Garden, the Strand, Westminster and part of Mayfair. The ward elects three councillors.

==Notable streets==
Notable streets include:
*St James&#x27;s Square, which retains many of its original houses but is mostly in office use. The London Library is located there.
*Jermyn Street, an upmarket retail street best known for bespoke shirtmakers and shops offering the finest gentlemen&#x27;s attire.
*Pall Mall, which contains many of London&#x27;s gentlemen&#x27;s clubs. It is also home to Marlborough House, the seat of the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the Québec Government Office in London.
*Crown Passage, a narrow street which splits off from Pall Mall opposite Marlborough House and is home to the Red Lion, one of the oldest pubs in London&#x27;s West End to still be in business.
*Haymarket was once the best-known centre of prostitution in London, but no trace remains of this part of its past. It contains two historic theatres: the Haymarket Theatre and Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre.
*Carlton House Terrace, a pair of grand terraces of houses designed by John Nash overlooking St. James&#x27;s Park.
*St James&#x27;s Street, which runs down from Piccadilly to St James&#x27;s Palace.

In September 2006, it opened a second gallery at 25–26 Mason&#x27;s Yard, off Duke Street, on a plot previously occupied by an electricity substation. The gallery is the first free-standing building to be built in the area for more than 30 years.

Other notable modern and contemporary art dealers in the St James&#x27;s area include Helly Nahmad Gallery, Paisnel Gallery, Bernard Jacobson Gallery, Thomas Dane, Whitford Fine Art and Panter &amp; Hall.

On the southernmost border of St James&#x27;s is The Mall where The Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Mall Galleries are located.

===Clubland===

St James&#x27;s is home to many of the best known gentlemen&#x27;s clubs in London, and sometimes, though not as often as formerly, referred to as &quot;Clubland&quot;. The clubs are organisations of English high society. A variety of groups come together here, such as military officers, politicians, motoring enthusiasts, yachtsmen, and other groups. In 1990, the Carlton Club, traditional meeting place for members of the Conservative Party, was struck by an IRA bomb.

<text>The Battle of Lang Vei (Vietnamese: &quot;Trận Làng Vây&quot;) began on the evening of 6 February 1968 and concluded during the early hours of 7 February, in Quảng Trị Province, South Vietnam. Towards the end of 1967, the 198th Tank Battalion of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam&#x27;s (PAVN) 202nd Armored Regiment received instructions from the North Vietnamese Ministry of Defense to reinforce the 304th Division as part of the Route 9–Khe Sanh Campaign. After an arduous journey down the Ho Chi Minh trail in January 1968, the 198th Tank Battalion linked up with the 304th Division for an offensive along Highway 9, which stretched from the Laotian border through to Quảng Trị Province. On 23 January, the 24th Regiment attacked the small Laotian outpost at Bane Houei Sane, under the control of the Royal Laos Army BV-33 &quot;Elephant&quot; Battalion. In that battle, the 198th Tank Battalion failed to reach the battle on time because its crews struggled to navigate their tanks through the rough local terrain. However, as soon as the PT-76 tanks of the 198th Tank Battalion turned up at Bane Houei Sane, the Laotian soldiers and their families retreated into South Vietnam.

After Bane Houei Sane was captured, the 24th Regiment prepared for another attack which targeted the U.S. Special Forces Camp at Lang Vei, manned by Detachment A-101 of the 5th Special Forces Group and indigenous Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) forces. On 6 February, the 24th Regiment, again supported by the 198th Tank Battalion, launched their assault on Lang Vei. Despite artillery and air support, the U.S.-led forces conceded ground and the PAVN quickly dominated their positions. By the early hours of 7 February the command bunker was the only position still held by Allied forces. To rescue the American survivors inside the Lang Vei Camp, a counterattack was mounted, but the Laotian soldiers who formed the bulk of the attack formation refused to fight the PAVN. Later on, U.S. Special Forces personnel were able to escape from the camp, and were rescued by a U.S. Marine task force from Khe Sanh Combat Base.

The task of capturing Lang Vei was entrusted to the PAVN&#x27;s 24th Regiment, 304th Division, led by Colonel Le Cong Phe. The regiment was to be supported by the 2nd Battalion (part of the 101D Regiment, 325th Division), the 2nd Artillery Battalion (part of the 675th Artillery Regiment), one tank company (part of the 198th Tank Battalion, 203rd Armored Regiment), two sapper companies, one anti-aircraft gun company, and one flamethrower platoon. One of the most important features of the PAVN formation were the elements of the 203rd Armoured Regiment; the &quot;Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign&quot; marked the first time the PAVN deployed its armored forces on the battlefield. In 1964, soldiers of the PAVN&#x27;s first armored unit—the 202nd Armored Regiment—was sent into South Vietnam without their T-34 medium tanks, because their prime mission was to learn enemy armor tactics in order to prepare for future missions. On 22 June 1965, the North Vietnamese Ministry of Defense passed Resolution 100/QD-QP, to establish the 203rd Armored Regiment and Resolution 101/QD-QP to create an Armored Force Command.

For PAVN commanders, the creation of an independent armored force command represented a significant milestone in the development of their army, because it enabled them to respond to the circumstances on the battlefield with a modern armored force. To prepare for their upcoming mission, the 203rd Armored Regiment undertook a series of combined-arms training with infantry and artillery units in different types of terrain, in order to operate in Vietnam&#x27;s rough mountainous and jungle conditions. On 5 August 1967, the Ministry of Defense ordered the 203rd Armored Regiment to form a sub-unit, namely the 198th Tank Battalion equipped with 22 PT-76 amphibious tanks, to bolster the strength of the 304th Division in South Vietnam. From their base in Luong Son, Hòa Bình Province, the 198th Tank Battalion began their arduous journey down the Ho Chi Minh Trail under constant U.S. air-strikes. In January 1968, the 198th Tank Battalion arrived on the field where it joined the 304th Division for an attack on the Laotian outpost of Ban Houei Sane.

===United States/South Vietnam===
The Lang Vei Special Forces Camp was placed under the control of the United States Army&#x27;s Detachment A-101, Company C, 5th Special Forces Group, to train and equip locally recruited Vietnamese through the CIDG program. Detachment A-101 had originally been established in July 1962 at Khe Sanh. In 1966, Detachment A-101 moved to its first site near the village of Lang Vei, when the United States Marines took control of Khe Sanh Combat Base as part of an American military build-up in South Vietnam&#x27;s northern provinces. However, the first camp at Lang Vei proved to be only temporary, as the PAVN attacked the camp on 4 May 1967. Even though the PAVN attack was repelled, damage to the camp was extensive. Since the original site lacked good observation and fields of fire beyond the barbed-wire perimeter, the 5th Special Forces Group commander decided to move the camp to a more suitable area, about 1,000 meters to the west. The new camp, on Highway 9 about to the west of Khe Sanh, was completed in 1967.

In 1967, Captain Franklin C. Willoughby assumed command of Detachment A-101 at Lang Vei, which had a tactical area of responsibility of , and was one of nine operational CIDG camps in I Corps Tactical Zone. From Lang Vei, U.S Special Forces personnel worked jointly with a 14-man Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) special forces contingent and six interpreters; they were responsible for border surveillance, interdiction of enemy infiltration and assistance in the Revolutionary Development Program. To accomplish those tasks Willoughby had one Montagnard company, three South Vietnamese rifle companies and three combat reconnaissance platoons at his disposal. Early in January 1968, Detachment A-101 received reinforcements in the form of a Mobile Strike Force Company, consisting of 161 Hre tribesmen, along with six U.S. Special Forces advisors. Elements of this Mobile Strike Force Company operated from a fortified bunker about 800 meters west of the camp, which served as an observation post. During the day the Hre tribesmen of the Mobile Strike Force conducted patrols; at night they took up ambush positions in the vicinity of the camp.

Prior to the battle, Willoughby placed Company 101 of 82 Bru Montagnard tribesmen, on the northeastern flank of the camp, with the 3rd Combat Reconnaissance Platoon positioned just behind it. Company 104 was placed in the southern end of the camp; Company 102, consisting of 42 men, was positioned at the opposite end about 450 meters to the west, while the 43-man Company 103 was positioned further south. The 1st and 2nd Combat Reconnaissance Platoons were placed at the northern and southern perimeters respectively, about 200 meters apart. Individually, the CIDG personnel carried M1 and M2 carbines with nearly 250,000 rounds of ammunition, and each company was also equipped with one 81 mm mortar. Among heavy weapons, there were two 106mm recoilless rifles, two 4.2-inch mortars and nineteen 60 mm mortars positioned around the camp. For close-in support, the CIDG personnel were furnished with 100 disposable M-72 anti-tank weapons. Antitank mines were requested, but were denied. If necessary, Willoughby could also request support from at least two rifle companies from the 26th Marine Regiment at Khe Sanh, along with artillery support from other locations within range.

Following the construction of the new camp site west of Lang Vei, Willoughby and his CIDG soldiers concentrated their efforts on strengthening the camp&#x27;s defenses, and they made relatively few contacts with the PAVN. However, unbeknownst to Willoughby, the PAVN 304th Division had assembled on the battlefield, reinforced by the 198th Tank Battalion, with the following orders: the 66th Regiment was given the task of capturing Khe Sanh village, part of Hướng Hóa District, to begin their &quot;Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign&quot;; the 24th Regiment was ordered to destroy the enemy strongholds of Ban Houei Sane and Lang Vei; the 9th Regiment was ordered to destroy any reinforcements that might try to relieve those bases areas. From December 1967, CIDG soldiers operating from Lang Vei began to report more frequent contacts with the PAVN. By mid-January, U.S. military intelligence also reported movements of PAVN formations across the Xe Pone River from Laos into South Vietnam. At the same time, the PAVN began to harass the Lang Vei Camp with mortar and artillery fire at least two or three times a week, and PAVN patrols probed the camp&#x27;s perimeters. 3rd Marine Division intelligence estimated the combat strength of PAVN and Viet Cong forces in the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone area during this period was 40,943 troops.

==Preliminary attacks==
On 21 January 1968, the PAVN 66th Regiment began its attack on Khe Sanh village, seat of the Hướng Hóa local government. At that time, Khe Sanh village was defended by the ARVN Regional Force 915th Company and the U.S. Marines Combined Action Company Oscar. Throughout the night, the combined U.S and South Vietnamese forces held their position, but at dawn U.S. soldiers on the ground called in air strikes and artillery support from the Khe Sanh Combat Base. Fighting in and around Khe Sanh village continued throughout the day and into the following night, and was finally captured by the PAVN at 09:30 on 22 January. At 11:00 Colonel David E. Lownds ordered Company D, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, to relieve the defenders inside Khe Sanh village, but reversed his orders after second thoughts about PAVN ambushes. Later, the ARVN Regional Force 256th Company was destroyed by the PAVN 9th Regiment as it marched to Khe Sanh village. The PAVN 66th Regiment paid a heavy price for their victory with 154 killed and 496 wounded.

On the evening of 23 January, one day after the fall of Khe Sanh village, the PAVN 304th Division moved against their next target, the small Laotian outpost at Ban Houei Sane. Prior to 1968, Laotian forces at Ban Houei Sane had played an important role in the war, watching PAVN infiltration into South Vietnam from a section of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through Laos. The outpost was manned by 700 Laotian soldiers of BV-33 &quot;Elephant&quot; Battalion, Royal Laos Army, led by Lieutenant Colonel Soulang Phetsampou. As night fell, the PAVN 3rd Battalion, 24th Regiment attacked the outpost. The 198th Tank Battalion, which was tasked with supporting the 24th Regiment, was delayed as their tank crews tried to navigate their PT-76 amphibious tanks through the rough local terrain. However, confusion quickly descended on the Laotian defenders as the PT-76 tanks turned up outside their outpost. After three hours of fighting, Lt. Col. Phetsampou decided to abandon his outpost, so he radioed the Lang Vei Camp and requested helicopters to evacuate his men and their families. However, as helicopters were unavailable, the Laotians decided to move eastward by foot along Highway 9, in an attempt to reach Lang Vei just across the border in South Vietnam.

Following the loss of both Khe Sanh village and Ban Houei Sane, thousands of civilian refugees made their way towards Lang Vei village and the Special Forces camp. With an estimated 8,000 non-combatants within a thousand meters of his camp, Willoughby radioed Da Nang for assistance. This arrived on 25 January in the form of food and medical supplies, along with a six-man Special Forces augmentation team. The Laotian soldiers of BV-33, with assistance from the new Special Forces team, were given materials to restore the old Lang Vei Camp, where they would remain until further orders were issued from Da Nang. The Laotian soldiers and their families brought with them stories of a PAVN attack supported by tanks, which was a cause for concern for Willoughby, because Ban Houei Sane was only away across the border. On 30 January Willoughby&#x27;s fears were confirmed when a PAVN deserter, Private Luong Dinh Du, surrendered himself to the U.S. Special Forces in Lang Vei. Under interrogation, Private Du revealed that tracked vehicles were positioned near his unit, but a planned attack was canceled twice for unknown reasons.

==Battle==

In response to the threat posed by the PAVN, Willoughby stepped up daytime patrols and night ambushes around his camp. On the morning of February 6, the PAVN fired mortars into the Lang Vei compound, wounding eight Camp Strike Force soldiers. That afternoon, Lt. Col. Daniel F. Shungel, commander of Company C, 5th Special Forces Group, flew into Lang Vei from Da Nang as a diplomatic gesture towards the Laotian commander Lt. Col. Phetsampou. At 18:10, the PAVN followed up their morning mortar attack with an artillery attack from 152 mm howitzers, firing 60 rounds into the camp. The bombardment wounded two more Strike Force soldiers and damaged two bunkers. Then at 23:30, PAVN artillery started pounding the camp, which covered the movement of the 24th Regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 101D Regiment. From an observation post above the tactical operations centre, Sergeant Nickolas Fragos saw the first PAVN tanks moving along Lang Troai Road, attempting to breach the barbed wire in front of Company 104. He immediately went down to the tactical operations center and described what he had witnessed to Willoughby; Shungel then advised Willoughby to concentrate all available artillery and air support on the PAVN formation just in front of Company 104. Soon afterwards, three PT-76 tanks were knocked out by a 106 mm recoilless rifle manned by Sergeant First Class James W. Holt, but the barbed wire in front of Company 104 was quickly overrun by the combined PAVN tank-infantry attack.

Meanwhile, from inside the tactical operations center, Willoughby was busy calling in air and artillery support. He also radioed the 26th Marines at Khe Sanh to request the deployment of two rifle companies as part of the reinforcement plan, but his request was denied. Believing that the attack on Company 104 was the enemy&#x27;s main effort, Willoughby concentrated his artillery support there during the early stages of the battle. About 10 minutes after the artillery had begun firing, a U.S. Air Force forward air-controller arrived over Lang Vei along with a flareship and an AC-119 &quot;Shadow&quot; gunship. Willoughby then requested air strikes on the ravines north of the camp, on Lang Troai Road, and the areas west of the early warning outpost manned by the Hre soldiers of the Mobile Strike Force. Despite the ferocity of the air strikes and artillery fire, the PAVN managed to break through the Company 104 area, forcing the defenders to retreat into the 2nd and 3rd Combat Reconnaissance Platoon positions behind them. By 01:15, the PAVN had captured the entire eastern end of the camp and, from the Company 104 area, began pouring fire on Company 101.

At the opposite end of the camp, three PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. Point blank, the tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the PAVN troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the PAVN overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the PAVN had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.

Above ground, U.S. and ARVN soldiers who had escaped death or capture tried to escape from the PAVN. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the PAVN. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers were able to make it through the barbed-wire barrier, but PAVN soldiers on the eastern side of the camp detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek bed that offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its request was also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.

Back in Lang Vei, the PAVN continued to harass the small force of soldiers still trapped in the command bunker with hand grenades, explosives and bursts of gunfire down the stairwell that led into the bunker. Shortly after 06:00, the PAVN threw several fragmentation grenades and tear gas grenades down the stairwell. Then, a voice called down the stairwell in Vietnamese, demanding the American-led forces give up at once. Following a quick discussion with his CIDG soldiers, the South Vietnamese special forces commander led his troops up the stairwell to surrender, but were killed by PAVN soldiers, leaving behind their American counterparts. After the South Vietnamese had gone up, there was another short verbal exchange between the Americans in the bunker and the PAVN in English, which was followed by another fire fight when the Americans refused surrender. At 06:30, the PAVN successfully blasted a hole on the northern wall, gaining direct access into the command bunker. However, instead of launching a direct attack on the last American stronghold, the PAVN continued to throw grenades through the wall.

At dawn, Sergeant First Class Eugene Ashley Jr. assembled about 100 Laotian soldiers of BV-33 at the old Lang Vei Camp in order to launch a rescue operation and, if possible, recapture the Special Forces Camp from the PAVN. Even though Lt. Col. Phetsampou had initially refused to take part in the operation, the Americans held him to his earlier promise of providing them with troops. After Ashley had formed the Laotian soldiers into a skirmish line, he radioed the forward air-controllers overhead to direct strafing runs on the Special Forces camp to soften up the enemy.

Meanwhile, as COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland learned of the PAVN attack on Lang Vei and Lownd&#x27;s refusal to send a relief force, he ordered the U.S. Marines to supply enough helicopters to airlift a 50 man strike force with the aim of rescuing the survivors. Subsequently, Colonel Jonathan F. Ladd, commanding officer of the 5th Special Forces Group, and Major General Norman J. Anderson, commander of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing were directed to formulate a rescue plan. While Willoughby and his men waited for help in the command bunker, Ashley and his Laotian contingent cautiously entered the Special Forces camp.

The Laotian soldiers were evidently reluctant to advance on the PAVN, and only inched forward when the Americans ordered them to do so. In their first attempt to break through PAVN lines, Ashley and his men were beaten back. Undeterred, the American-led forces tried to penetrate PAVN positions several times, and only stopped after Ashley was shot in the chest and later killed by an exploding artillery round. Ashley was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The Laotians, who feared the PAVN, disengaged from the fight and fled. After Ashley&#x27;s final attack had failed, Willoughby and his men made the decision to abandon their position. However, after Specialist Four James L. Moreland was mortally wounded, Willoughby decided to leave him in the bunker, because the remaining Americans were in no physical condition to carry out the wounded man. Under the cover of U.S. air strikes, Willoughby and other American survivors escaped towards the old Lang Vei Camp, which was evacuated by Marine CH-46s from HMM-262, which lifted in a 50 man reaction force. By 17:30 on 7 February, all known survivors had been evacuated to Khe Sanh.

==Aftermath==
The fight for Lang Vei, though short in duration, was a costly endeavor for both sides. In their efforts to hold the camp, the combined Montagnard and South Vietnamese CIDG soldiers suffered 309 killed, 64 wounded, and 122 captured. Of the original 24 Americans who took part in the battle, seven were killed in action, 11 sustained injuries, and three were captured. Nearly all of the camp&#x27;s weaponry and equipment were either destroyed or captured by enemy forces. For the North Vietnamese, the battle for Lang Vei marked the first successful use of armor in the war. In terms of human casualties, the PAVN claimed to have lost 90 soldiers killed and 220 wounded.

On the evening of 7 February, though the fight was over for the military forces, the ordeal continued for the civilians who were caught in the fighting. An estimated 6,000 survivors from the old Lang Vei Camp including CIDG soldiers and their families, Montagnard tribesmen and the Laotians, followed the Americans and descended on the Khe Sanh Combat Base. However, when they reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that PAVN soldiers may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though PAVN artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On 15 February, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, Phetsampou and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.

<text>The Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii) is a pine squirrel found in western North America, from the Pacific Northwest (including the northwestern coastal states of the United States as well as the southwestern coast of British Columbia in Canada) to central California, with an isolated subspecies in northern Baja California, Mexico. It is sometimes known as the chickaree or pine squirrel, although these names are also used for the American red squirrel. Variant spellings of the common name are Douglas&#x27; squirrel and Douglas&#x27;s squirrel. The Native Americans of Kings River called it the &quot;Pillillooeet&quot;, in imitation of its characteristic alarm call.

==Description==
John Muir described the Douglas squirrel as &quot;by far the most interesting and influential of the California Sciuridæ&quot;. At full maturity, it is about in length (including its tail, which is about long), and weighs between . Its appearance varies according to the season. In the summer, it is greyish or almost greenish-brown on its back, and pale orange on the chest and belly, while legs and feet appear brown. In the winter, the coat is browner and the underside is grayer; also, the ears appear even tuftier than they do in summer. Like many squirrels, the Douglas squirrel has a white eye-ring.

==Breeding==
Mating can occur as early as February. Gestation is about four weeks, and the young (which are altricial) are weaned at about eight weeks of age. There may be up to six kits in a litter, though four is more usual. In the southern and lower parts of their range, they produce two litters each year.

==Habitat==
Douglas squirrels live in coniferous forest habitats along the Pacific Coast, from the Sierra Nevada (mountains) of California, northwards to the southwestern coast of British Columbia. &quot;Tamiasciurus douglasii&quot; prefer old-growth forests or mature second-growth forests, and some authors regard them as dependent on its presence. Mearns&#x27;s squirrel is a distinctive subspecies of the Douglas squirrel that instead inhabits xeric pine forests in a small portion of Baja California.

Throughout most their range, Douglas squirrels essentially replace the niche of the American red squirrel, which inhabits the coniferous forests of the rest of North America. The two species have very minimal overlap in the territory.

Douglas squirrels are territorial; in winter, each squirrel occupies a territory of about 10 000 square metres, but during the breeding season a mated pair will defend a single territory together. Douglas squirrels are active by day, throughout the year, often chattering noisily at intruders. On summer nights, they sleep in ball-shaped nests that they make in the trees, but in the winter they use holes in trees as nests. Groups of squirrels seen together during the summer are likely to be juveniles from a single litter.

==Diet==
Douglas squirrels mostly eat seeds of coniferous trees such as Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) and shore pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;). They also eat the fleshy scales of green giant sequoia cones, as well as acorns, berries, mushrooms, the eggs of birds such as yellow warblers, and some fruit including strawberries and plums. Douglas squirrels are larder hoarders, storing their food in a single location or &#x27;larder&#x27; called a midden. As the squirrel peels the scales of cones to get at the seeds, the discarded scales accumulate into piles that can grow to several meters across as the same site is used by generations of squirrels.

Their predators include Pacific martens, bobcats, domestic cats, northern goshawks, and owls; although they quickly acclimatize to human presence, humans can be a threat to them, through robbing of their cone caches to find seeds for tree cultivation and through the destruction of old-growth forest. However, the squirrels&#x27; numbers appear to be unaffected by commercial thinning of forests.

<text>The Belgrade International Theatre Festival (abbr. BITEF) is a theatre festival that takes place every September annually in Belgrade, Serbia.

== History ==
Founded in 1967, BITEF has continually followed and supported the latest theatre trends. It has become one of the most significant culture festivals of Serbia.

During the 1960s, the founders of this festival (Mira Trailović, Jovan Ćirilov and their associates) courageously followed tumultuous events in global theatre teeming with avant-garde explorations. In the 1980s, BITEF showed Belgrade the highest reaches of the art of theatre, thus becoming one of the few festivals comprising both experimental forms and significant classic achievements. In spite of political-economic crisis and embargo, in the final decade of the 20th century, BITEF, thanks to the help of international culture centres, government and non-government organizations, managed to keep abreast with the rest of world, through promotion of new theatre trends and ultimate theatre values.

In 2000, BITEF was awarded a Special Prize by the Jury of the Europe Theatre Prize, in Taormina. BITEF was the first international theatre festival to receive an award from &quot;Premio Europa per il Teatro&quot;.

== Jury ==

<text>The North American Aviation T-28 Trojan is a radial-engine military trainer aircraft manufactured by North American Aviation and used by the United States Air Force and United States Navy beginning in the 1950s. Besides its use as a trainer, the T-28 was successfully employed as a counter-insurgency aircraft, primarily during the Vietnam War. It has continued in civilian use as an aerobatics and warbird performer.

==Design and development==
On 24 September 1949, the XT-28 (company designation NA-159) was flown for the first time, designed to replace the T-6 Texan. The T-28A arrived at the Air Proving Ground, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in mid-June 1950, for suitability tests as an advanced trainer by the 3200th Fighter Test Squadron, with consideration given to its transition, instrument, and gunnery capabilities. Found satisfactory, a contract was issued and between 1950 and 1957, a total of 1,948 were built.

Following the T-28&#x27;s withdrawal from U.S. military service, a number were remanufactured by Hamilton Aircraft into two versions called the Nomair. The first refurbished machines, designated T-28R-1 were similar to the standard T-28s they were adapted from, and were supplied to the Brazilian Navy. Later, a more ambitious conversion was undertaken as the T-28R-2, which transformed the two-seat tandem aircraft into a five-seat cabin monoplane for general aviation use. Other civil conversions of ex-military T-28As were undertaken by PacAero as the Nomad Mark I and Nomad Mark II

==Operational history==
After becoming adopted as a primary trainer by the USAF, the United States Navy and Marine Corps adopted it as well. Although the Air Force phased out the aircraft from primary pilot training by the early 1960s, continuing use only for limited training of special operations aircrews and for primary training of select foreign military personnel, the aircraft continued to be used as a primary trainer by the Navy (and by default, the Marine Corps and Coast Guard) well into the early 1980s.

The largest single concentration of this aircraft was employed by the U.S. Navy at Naval Air Station Whiting Field in Milton, Florida, in the training of student naval aviators. The T-28&#x27;s service career in the U.S. military ended with the completion of the phase-in of the T-34C turboprop trainer. The last U.S. Navy training squadron to fly the T-28 was VT-27 &quot;Boomers&quot;, based at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas, flying the last T-28 training flight in early 1984. The last T-28 in the Training Command, BuNo 137796, departed for Naval District Washington on 14 March 1984, in order to be displayed permanently at Naval Support Facility Anacostia, D.C.

===Vietnam War combat===
In 1963, a Royal Lao Air Force T-28 piloted by Lieutenant Chert Saibory, a Thai national, defected to North Vietnam. Saibory was immediately imprisoned and his aircraft was impounded. Within six months the T-28 was refurbished and commissioned into the North Vietnamese Air Force as its first fighter aircraft. Lt. Saibory later trained NVAF pilot Nguyen Van Ba in the operation of the T-28, where Nguyen flew the T-28 in its first successful interception against an RVNAF C-123 Provider on 15 February 1964, earning the NVAF its first-ever aerial victory. The NVAF unit that operated the T-28 in the respective military operation has later evolved into the modern Vietnam Airlines.

T-28s were supplied to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) in support of ARVN ground operations, seeing extensive service during the Vietnam War in RVNAF hands, as well as the Secret War in Laos. A T-28 Trojan was the first US fixed wing attack aircraft (non-transport type) lost in South Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. Capt. Robert L. Simpson, USAF, Detachment 2A, 1st Air Commando Group, and Lt. Hoa, RVNAF, were shot down by ground fire on 28 August 1962, while flying close air support. Neither crewman survived. The USAF lost 23 T-28s to all causes during the war, with the last two losses occurring in 1968.

===Other combat uses===
T-28s were used by the CIA in the former Belgian Congo during the 1960s.

The T-28B and D were the primary ground attack aircraft of Khmer Air Force in Cambodia during the war there, largely provided from the U.S. Military Equipment Delivery Team and maintained by Air America. On the night of 21 January 1971, PAVN sappers managed to get close enough to destroy the majority at Pochentong airbase. Replacements were quickly shipped in. On 17 March 1973 a pilot of a T-28, said to be Capt. So Petra, a common-law husband of one of the daughters of the overthrown Prince Norodom Sihanouk, machine gunned and bombed the palace of Lon Nol in an attempt to assassinate him, killing at least 20 and wounding 35, before defecting to Khmer Rouge held lands.

France&#x27;s Armée de l&#x27;Air used locally re-manufactured Trojans, &quot;T-28S Fennec&quot;, for close support missions in Algeria.

Nicaragua replaced its fleet of 30+ ex-Swedish P-51s with T-28s in the early 1960s, with more aircraft acquired in the 1970s and 1980s.

The Philippines utilized T-28s (colloquially known as &quot;Tora-toras&quot;) during the 1989 Philippine coup attempt. The aircraft were often deployed as dive bombers by rebel forces.

===Civilian use===
AeroVironment modified and armored a T-28A to fly weather research for South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology, funded by the National Science Foundation, and operated in this capacity from 1969 to 2005. SDSM&amp;T was planning to replace it with another modified, but more modern, former military aircraft, specifically a Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. This plan was found to carry too many risks associated with the costly modifications required and the program was cancelled in 2018.

MicroProse purchased a T-28B in 1988 for use in marketing their flight simulator video games, and named it &quot;Miss MicroProse&quot;. USAF reserve pilot Bill Stealey would fly with games journalists for this purpose, and ran a competition called &quot;I Cheated Death with Major Bill&quot; which selected three fans to fly with him on a &quot;stunt-filled flight lesson&quot;. The plane was later sold to a flight school in Cincinnati.

===Aerobatics and warbird display===
Many retired T-28s were subsequently sold to private civil operators, and due to their reasonable operating costs are often found flying or displayed as warbirds today.

==Variants==

;XT-28
:Prototype; two built.

;T-28A
:U.S. Air Force version with an Wright R-1300-1 radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller; 1,194 built.

;T-28B
:U.S. Navy land-based trainer version with Wright R-1820-86 radial engine driving a three-bladed propeller and fitted with a belly-mounted speed brake; 489 built from new and 17 converted from T-28.

;T-28C
:U.S. Navy version, a T-28B with shortened propeller blades and tailhook for carrier-landing training; 299 built.

;T-28D &quot;Nomad&quot;
:T-28Bs converted for the USAF in 1962 for the counter-insurgency, reconnaissance, search and rescue, and forward air controller roles in Vietnam. Fitted with two underwing hardpoints. The later T-28D-5 had ammo pans inside the wings that could be hooked up to hardpoint-mounted gun pods for a better center of gravity and aerodynamics; 321 converted by Pacific Airmotive (Pac-Aero).
::T-28 Nomad Mark I - Wright R-1820-56S engine ().
::T-28 Nomad Mark II - Wright R-1820-76A ()
::T-28 Nomad Mark III - Wright R-1820-80 ()

;Fairchild AT-28D
:Attack model of the T-28D used for Close Air Support (CAS) missions by the USAF and allied Air Forces in Southeast Asia, which were nicknamed &quot;Tangos&quot; by their pilots. It was fitted with six underwing hardpoints and the rocket-powered Stanley Yankee ejection seat; 72 converted by Fairchild Hiller.

;YAT-28E
:Experimental development of the counter-insurgency T-28D. It was powered by a Lycoming YT-55L-9 turboprop, and armed with two machine guns and up to of weapons on 12 underwing hardpoints. Three prototypes were converted from T-28As by North American, with the first model flying on 15 February 1963. The project was canceled in 1965.

;T-28S Fennec
:Ex-USAF T-28As converted in 1959 for use by the French Armée de l&#x27;Air, replacing the Morane-Saulnier MS.733A. It was flown by their &quot;Escadrilles d&#x27;Aviation Légère d&#x27;Appui&quot; (EALA; &quot;Light Aviation Support Squadrons&quot;) in the counterinsurgency role in North Africa from 1959 to 1962. Fitted with an electrically powered sliding canopy, side-armor, a Wright R-1820-97 supercharged radial engine (the model used in the B-17 bomber), and four underwing hardpoints. It is referred to as the &quot;S&quot; variant because its engine had a supercharger on it; it has also been referred to as the T-28F variant – with the &quot;F&quot; standing for France.

:For fire support missions it usually carried two double-mount machine gun pods (with 100 rounds per gun) and two MATRA &quot;Type 122&quot; 6 x rocket pods. It could also carry on paired hardpoints a HE or GP &quot;iron&quot; bomb, a MATRA &quot;Type 361&quot; 36 x rocket pod, a SNEB 7 x rocket pod, or a MATRA &quot;Type 13&quot; single-rail, MATRA &quot;Type 20&quot; or &quot;Type 21&quot; -rail, MATRA &quot;Type 41&quot; -rail (2 x 2), or MATRA &quot;Type 61&quot; or &quot;Type 63&quot; -rail (3 x 3) SERAM T10 heavy rocket launchers. Improvised napalm bombs (called &quot;bidons spéciaux&quot;, or &quot;special cans&quot;) were created by dropping gas tanks loaded with octagel-thickened fuel inside, then later igniting or detonating the spilled fuel with white phosphorus rockets.
:Total 148 airframes bought from Pacific Airmotive (Pac Aero) and modified by Sud-Aviation in France. After the war the French government offered them for sale from 1964 to 1967. They sold most of them to Morocco and Argentina. Argentina later sold some to Uruguay and Honduras.

;T-28P
:T-28S &quot;Fennec&quot; aircraft sold to the Argentinian Navy as carrier-borne attack aircraft. They were given shortened propeller blades and a tailhook to allow carrier landings.

;T-28R Nomair
:An attempt by Hamilton Aircraft Company of Tucson, Arizona to make a civilianized &quot;Nomad III&quot;-equivalent out of refurbished ex-USAF T-28As. It had a Wright Cyclone R-1820-80 engine to make it fast and powerful, but had to lengthen the wingspan by seven feet to reduce the stall speed to below a &quot;street-legal&quot; 70 knots. The prototype flew for the first time in September 1960, and the FAA Type Certificate was received on 15 February 1962. At the time, the T-28-R2 was the fastest single-engined standard category aircraft available in the United States. It had been flown to a height of .

;T-28R-1 &quot;Nomair I&quot;
:A military trainer that had a tandem cockpit, dual instrumentation and flying controls, and hydraulically-actuated rearward-sliding canopy. Six were sold in 1962 as carrier-landing trainers to the Brazilian Navy and were modified with a carrier arrestor hook. They were later transferred to the Brazilian Air Force.

;T-28R-2 &quot;Nomair II&quot;
:Modified to have a cramped five-seater cabin (one pilot and two rows of two passengers) that opened from the port side. Ten aircraft were modified in all; one was sold to a high-altitude photographic company.

;RT-28
:Photo reconnaissance conversion for counter-insurgency use with Royal Lao Air Force. Number of conversions unknown.

;AIDC T-CH-1
:A derivative of the T-28 developed by AIDC in Taiwan, the AIDC T-CH-1 was powered by a Avco Lycoming T53-L-701 turboprop engine. Fifty aircraft were produced for the Taiwanese Air Force between March 1976 and 1981. The type has since been retired.

<text>Sisters is an American family drama television series that aired from May 11, 1991 to May 4, 1996 on NBC. The series was created by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, who were also the executive producers and showrunners.

==Overview==
&quot;Sisters&quot; focused on four very different sisters living in Winnetka, Illinois. Their recently deceased father, Thomas Reed, a doctor, had been absent and a workaholic, while their long-suffering mother, Beatrice, turned to alcoholism to cope with his neglect and affairs. Having always wanted sons, their father had called the girls by male versions of their full names: Alexandra was called Alex; Theodora, Teddy; Georgiana, Georgie; and Francesca, Frankie.

For the first two seasons, each episode began with the sisters&#x27; weekly ritual of chatting in a steam bath together, but switched to a more traditional opening sequence beginning with the 1992–1993 season: glossy, black-and-white filmed scenes of the sisters engaging in various activities during both their childhood and adult years. Initially, the only soundtrack used for the opening was the sounds of the characters, but in the fall of 1993 a piano solo composed by John Debney was added as theme music.

Most episodes of the show featured a number of flashbacks, in which the characters would interact with or simply observe their younger selves (played by younger actresses). Although the show was a drama with soap opera–style storylines, the show was also quirky and offbeat in the style of other shows at the time like CBS&#x27;s &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;.

===Season One===
One year after her husband&#x27;s death, Beatrice reluctantly sold the family home to move into a seniors&#x27; condominium building. Depressed, Beatrice relapses on alcohol and is arrested for driving under the influence. Teddy comes back into town from California to discover her ex-husband Mitch is dating her younger sister Frankie. Alex believes her husband Wade is cheating on her, but instead discovers he is a crossdresser. Bea goes to court for her DUI charge; the judge on her case, Truman Ventner, is an acquaintance of hers who also happens to live in her building. Teddy pursues Mitch and although he resists her, they eventually spend a night together; shortly afterward Mitch and Frankie (who is unaware of the encounter) announce their engagement and plan a quick wedding. Teddy breaks up their wedding drunk with a shotgun; Frankie decides not to reschedule the wedding and she and Mitch stop seeing each other. Ashamed of how her behavior is affecting the family and especially her daughter Cat, Teddy leaves Cat with Mitch and announces she will return to California alone. Georgie&#x27;s son Evan is diagnosed with leukemia, and Teddy decides to stay in Winnetka.

===Season Two===
Georgie attempts to balance her needs with Evan&#x27;s during his treatment. Alex discovers Wade has been cheating on her for six months with a former patient, and she and Wade divorce. Reed (Ashley Judd) reacts by rebelling and dropping out of school. Frankie makes a financial investment in Mitch&#x27;s fish market; while filing paperwork at City Hall, they decide to elope. Teddy discovers she is pregnant with Mitch&#x27;s baby following their earlier brief encounter; she tells the family that she became pregnant after a one-night stand. Mitch eventually finds out the truth, but Frankie never does. Truman and Beatrice begin a relationship. Teddy begins a job doing window dressing at a fashion boutique, then suffers a miscarriage. Alex begins dating her plumber, Victor, while Wade tries to win her back. After Evan&#x27;s favorite teacher is dismissed for being HIV-positive, Georgie runs for the school board, but narrowly loses. Teddy is let go from the fashion boutique, embarks on a brief career as a &quot;Wonderful You&quot; makeup saleslady, and begins her clothing design career when during an (unsuccessful) makeup sales party, Alex&#x27;s socialite friends notice Teddy&#x27;s hand-painted blouse and demand to order blouses of their own. Alex and Wade decide to reconcile. Frankie discovers she cannot carry a child; following a failed adoption, she asks Georgie to be a surrogate mother for her baby.

===Season Three===
Alex plans an elaborate ceremony and reception at her house for Truman and Beatrice&#x27;s wedding, but they decide to elope; Reed and Kirby (Paul Rudd) are married there instead. Georgie gives birth to Frankie&#x27;s son Thomas George after a car accident; Georgie has difficulty seeing him as her sister&#x27;s child. Alex and Teddy feud due to Alex&#x27;s jealousy of Teddy&#x27;s newfound success as a clothing designer. Simon Bolt (Mark Frankel) invests in Teddy&#x27;s fashion design company but later sells it to a Texan investor without consulting Teddy. Teddy walks away from her company when the new owner does not respect her artistic vision. A Hollywood producer makes a TV movie of the family&#x27;s surrogacy story. Alex is diagnosed with breast cancer, which leads her to doing a standup comedy act about her cancer experience. Frankie and Mitch divorce and spar over custody of Thomas George.

===Season Four===
Cat is attacked and raped by a college acquaintance; James Falconer (George Clooney) is assigned to investigate the case. He is able to help Cat remember her attacker, Kyle, and he is arrested. However the prosecution cannot prove its case and Kyle is found not guilty only to be shot and killed on the courthouse steps by a previous victim. Frankie quits her executive job and buys the Sweet Sixteen diner. Teddy and Falconer run into each other at an AA meeting and begin dating. Trevor rebels and is sent to boarding school, then runs away from the school and disappears. Georgie falls into a depression about her perceived failure as a parent and considers suicide, but decides against it and asks for help. Truman is diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and initially refuses to tell Beatrice. The stress of Trevor&#x27;s disappearance leads Georgie and John to separate. Alex gets her own talk show with a lesbian producer named Norma (Nora Dunn). Alex meets Big Al (Robert Klein) when he agrees to sponsor her talk show; she initially dislikes him but they soon begin dating. A fifth sister, Charlotte Bennett (Jo Anderson), is introduced. Charlotte is a cancer patient who needs a bone marrow donation from a relative. Although none of the sisters are a match, she receives the bone marrow from an unrelated donor. Keeping the customary manner in which her half-sisters go by male versions of their full names, Charley is brought into the family and welcomed, primarily through Frankie&#x27;s effort and determination. Alex and Big Al marry; on their wedding night he is arrested for tax evasion. Georgie and John reunite after realizing they cannot control what happens to Trevor. Reed returns for a visit and gives birth to Halsey. Trevor finally returns from the streets when Winnetka is hit by a tornado, and Falconer and Teddy marry on a plane that is caught in the storm.

===Season Five===
Falconer is killed. His murder was ordered by a criminal he was about to testify against in court. Georgie begins seeing a new therapist, Dr. Caspian (Daniel Gerroll), who manipulates her into believing she had been molested by her father. Frankie inherits a boxer, Lucky (John Wesley Shipp), from a former client, and eventually begins a relationship with him. A viewer with terminal cancer asks Alex to take care of her daughter, Roxie (Kathryn Zaremba); Alex wants to adopt the little girl, but her father returns and they move away together. Unable to cope with Falconer&#x27;s death, Teddy relapses with alcohol. Big Al is released from prison early and runs for mayor. Teddy shows up drunk to his election night victory party and hits Evan on his bicycle with her car; she leaves to enter rehab. Truman gives Alex a videotaped message asking her to help him end his life once his Alzheimer&#x27;s has advanced. Dr. Caspian and Georgie begin an affair during her therapy sessions; Georgie leaves John, believing Dr. Caspian loves her, but Dr. Caspian ignores her and claims she has misinterpreted their &quot;work&quot; together. Georgie realizes she has been manipulated, but has no evidence to get the psychological board to revoke his license. Charley begins therapy with Dr. Caspian and eventually manages to record him behaving inappropriately toward her during their sessions. Norma fires Alex from her talk show for talking about AIDS against the network&#x27;s wishes. Frankie accidentally creates Cowlotta, a large pink cow character that children love, and is asked to move to Japan to manage the character. Alex helps Truman end his life; she is arrested, but avoids prison when a terminally ill judge recuses himself from her case. Teddy has an affair with Daniel Albright (Gregory Harrison), the man who had Falconer killed, in an attempt to gather evidence that will send him to jail. With Lucky&#x27;s help, she succeeds and Albright is arrested. Alex and Norma run a pledge drive for the local PBS station and are asked to create a new version of Alex&#x27;s talk show. Bea is depressed following Truman&#x27;s death; Charley offers her a job working as a receptionist in her free clinic. Teddy meets Jack Chambers (Philip Casnoff), the man who received Falconer&#x27;s transplanted heart, and strikes up a brief relationship with him.

===Season Six===
Now divorced from John, Georgie goes to graduate school in psychology. She begins a relationship with Brian (Joe Flanigan), a 24-year-old student in her classes who was very standoffish to her at first. Teddy and Cat are carjacked; Cat meets police officer Billy Griffin (Eric Close) when reporting the crime. Later, Teddy is accidentally shot in the head with the gun she bought for protection. She falls into a coma, but Alex convinces brilliant neurosurgeon Dr. Gabriel Sorenson (Stephen Collins) to operate and save her life. Teddy eventually begins a relationship with Sorenson, and Cat decides to enter the police academy. Charley (now played by Sheila Kelley) becomes a foster parent to Jesse (Sean Nelson), the son of a woman at her free clinic who died. She also begins dating her colleague Dr. Wes Hayes (Michael Whaley), though he is initially resistant to an interracial relationship. Reed (now played by Noelle Parker) returns to town after divorcing Kirby and losing custody of her daughter Halsey, and ends up running a high-priced call-girl ring. Alex turns crucial evidence over to the police and Reed is sentenced to community service. Teddy and Gabe decide to marry, but their wedding is interrupted when a heart donor is found for Big Al; Teddy and Gabe finally marry at the hospital just before Big Al is taken into surgery. Charley decides to adopt Jesse, and plans to quickly marry Wes because two parents make a more appealing adoptive family; however, Charley eventually realizes Jesse should instead be adopted by the family that had already adopted his brother. Charley and Wes marry anyway. Alex&#x27;s talk show is canceled again and she decides to take an extended trip to help flooding victims in Tennessee. In the final episode, Georgie&#x27;s college thesis about her sisters deeply angers Alex and Charley, though Teddy finds it amusing. The sisters must put aside their differences when Beatrice has a major stroke. Shortly before Beatrice dies Frankie returns from Japan and clashes with Charley. Later, Frankie announces she wants to move back home to Winnetka. Georgie sees John at Bea&#x27;s memorial service and realizes she misses him; shortly afterward, she breaks up with Brian. The sisters scatter their mother&#x27;s ashes on the rosebushes she named after them. Teddy announces she is pregnant with a daughter, who she plans to name Beatrice Rose. Georgie and John discuss reconciling and share an embrace. Finally, Alex assumes the role of family matriarch.

==Characters==

===Main===
*Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Reed Halsey Barker (Swoosie Kurtz): Eldest sister Alex was wealthy and somewhat superficial, but remained protective and close to her sisters. Her first marriage to wealthy, cross-dressing plastic surgeon Wade Halsey (David Dukes) ended following his infidelity. Alex&#x27;s experience with breast cancer eventually led to a career as a talk show host, where she met and married &quot;Big Al&quot; Barker (Robert Klein), an outlandish but likeable home appliance retailer who sponsored her talk show as &quot;The Prince of Pricetown&quot;. She often clashed with her rebellious daughter Reed (Ashley Judd). Alex is the only character to appear in every episode of the series.
*Theodora &quot;Teddy&quot; Reed Margolis Falconer Sorenson (Sela Ward): Free-spirited second sister Teddy was a recovering alcoholic who had been living in California prior to the beginning of the series. Upon her return to Winnetka, Teddy reacted poorly when she learned her ex-husband Mitch (Ed Marinaro) was in a relationship with her sister Frankie, and openly pursued Mitch even though he and Frankie were engaged. In the aftermath of her behavior at Frankie and Mitch&#x27;s wedding, Teddy seemed ashamed of herself, and in the next season of the show, she stopped drinking and stopped pursuing Mitch. Teddy had been an artist as a teenager and during the series launched a career as a fashion designer, which led to a relationship with British millionaire Simon Bolt (Mark Frankel) who purchased and eventually sold her fashion company (then named &quot;Theodora Reed&quot;; Teddy then opened a new fashion company under the name &quot;Teddy Reed,&quot; only to be ousted by her shareholders in season six and reopen yet again under the name T.R.). Teddy and Mitch had a teenage daughter, Cat (Heather McAdam). When Cat was raped at college, Teddy met James Falconer (George Clooney), the detective who investigated the rape; he was killed shortly after their marriage. In the final season, Teddy married neurosurgeon Dr. Gabriel Sorenson (Stephen Collins) and became pregnant with a daughter.
*Georgiana &quot;Georgie&quot; Reed Whitsig (Patricia Kalember): The third and most level-headed and responsible sister, Georgie was a stay-at-home mom and off-and-on real estate agent. She was the most trusted confidant of her sisters. On the surface, she had an ideal domestic life with a loving if eccentric husband John (Garrett M. Brown) and two sons, Trevor (Ryan Francis) and Evan (Dustin Berkovitz). After Evan successfully battled leukemia, Georgie decided to repay the blessing by acting as surrogate mother for her sister Frankie&#x27;s child Thomas George. Georgie experienced a major crisis when her son Trevor rebelled; he was eventually sent away to a school for troubled teens. Georgie felt she was a failure as a parent and considered suicide, but abandoned the idea after realizing how deeply the rest of her family would feel such a loss. Trevor eventually returned to his family, genuinely remorseful for all the harm he had done and eventually decides to enroll in the military. In the next season, Georgie sought professional help, only to fall under the spell of a corrupt therapist (played by Kalember&#x27;s real-life husband, Daniel Gerroll). He manipulated Georgie into an affair, which eventually resulted in her divorce from John. During the last season Georgie attended graduate school in psychology, where she met Brian, a younger man who she dated through the season. In the series finale, it was implied that Georgie and John might reconcile.
*Francesca &quot;Frankie&quot; Reed Margolis (Julianne Phillips) (seasons 1–5, special guest star in season 6): Youngest sister Frankie was a workaholic businesswoman. She married her sister Teddy&#x27;s ex-husband Mitch, and after discovering she suffered from infertility, asked her sister Georgie to act as a surrogate mother for her child Thomas George. She was also very devoted to her career, which put a strain on her relationship with Mitch and eventually resulted in their divorce. Following their divorce, Frankie quit her executive job and became the owner of the Sweet Sixteen, the sisters&#x27; favorite local diner. In the fifth season, Phillips left the show and Frankie moved to Japan for work, although she did return for the two-hour series finale.
*Dr. Charlotte &quot;Charley&quot; Bennett Hayes (Jo Anderson: recurring, seasons 4–5; Sheila Kelley: main, season 6): During the fourth season, the sisters discovered a fifth sister, the love child of an affair their father had had with another woman. This fifth sister, Charley Bennett, was played initially by Jo Anderson on a recurring basis and then by Sheila Kelley, who received starring status in the final season. Charley was integrated into the story lines as Frankie was phased out, as Julianne Phillips had decided to leave the show. Charley had spent her childhood in foster homes and was initially somewhat cold towards her newfound sisters, but eventually came to accept them into her life. Charley was a doctor who worked in a free health care clinic with her colleague and eventual husband Dr. Wes Hayes. During the final season, Charley took in an orphaned teenager named Jesse and intended to adopt him, but ultimately did not complete the adoption because she realized Jesse should go with his brother who had been adopted by another family.
*Beatrice Reed Ventner (Elizabeth Hoffman): Beatrice, the sisters&#x27; mother and the family matriarch, was a recovering alcoholic who at the start of the series had been recently widowed. Her husband&#x27;s long-term affair with his nurse had caused her to seek solace in alcohol; she regretted that Teddy had apparently inherited her alcoholism. In the third season she married retired local judge Truman Ventner, who later suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s. Beatrice died in the series finale.

===Supporting===
*John Whitsig (Garrett M. Brown: seasons 1–5, special guest star in season 6): Georgie&#x27;s husband John was the most prominently featured of all the sisters&#x27; husbands. At the beginning of the series John had been laid off and spent much of his time at home in his bathrobe singing old vocal standards. He recorded an album, &quot;The Sound of Whitsig,&quot; but when his son Evan was diagnosed with leukemia, John returned to work as an accountant. Brown received starring status for the first five seasons. During season 5, Georgie and John separated in the wake of her affair with Dr. Caspian, and he did not return as a regular for the final season, though while offscreen John wrote a hit song, &quot;Thank You, Babe, For Leavin&#x27; Me,&quot; which caused Georgie much consternation. John did return in the series finale, and it appeared that he and Georgie might reconcile.
*Mitch Margolis (Ed Marinaro: seasons 1–4): Mitch was Teddy&#x27;s high school sweetheart and first husband. Together they had a daughter, Cat, but eventually Teddy and Mitch divorced. Later he started seeing her younger sister Frankie, which caused tension between the sisters. Mitch and Frankie eventually married and had a son, though they too ultimately divorced. Marinaro received starring status for the first four seasons, but did not make any appearances in seasons 5 and 6, though his character was mentioned on several occasions.
*Catherine &quot;Cat&quot; Margolis (Heather McAdam: recurring, seasons 1–5; main, season 6): The daughter of Teddy and Mitch, Cat was the most prominently featured of all the sisters&#x27; children, appearing frequently throughout all the seasons. Cat was featured in a controversial storyline where she was raped. Eventually, as a result of this experience, she decided to become a cop. While training, she met her partner Billy, who she eventually fell in love with. During the final season McAdam received starring status, something none of the other children of the sisters had during the show&#x27;s run.

===Recurring===
*Dr. Wade Halsey (David Dukes: seasons 1–3): Dr. Wade Halsey was Alex&#x27;s first husband and the father of their daughter Reed. Wade was a successful plastic surgeon who resented that Alex needed everything in her life to be perfect, including him. During the first season, Alex suspected Wade was cheating on her when she discovered lingerie receipts and hotel room charges on their credit card, but when she confronted him, she discovered he was actually a crossdresser. In the second season it was revealed that Wade actually had been cheating on Alex with a former patient, and they divorced. Wade decided he wanted Alex back and they reconciled toward the end of the second season, but during the third season when Alex expected him to propose remarriage, Wade announced he was marrying a different woman. Wade&#x27;s character did not appear after the third season.
*Reed Halsey Philby (Kathy Wagner: season 1; Ashley Judd: seasons 2–4; Noelle Parker: season 6): Alex and Wade&#x27;s daughter Reed appeared on and off throughout the show&#x27;s run and was played by three different actresses. Kathy Wagner originated the role of Reed in season one; Ashley Judd took over the role in fall 1991, playing Reed in seasons 2–4. Judd left the show in 1994 to focus on her film career after winning critical acclaim for the film &quot;Ruby in Paradise&quot;. Reed was absent for season 5, and the character returned in season 6, portrayed by Noelle Parker. Reed rebelled against her parents by dropping out of school, and later eloped with aspiring filmmaker Kirby Philby (Paul Rudd). They had a daughter, Halsey, at the end of season 4. By the final season Reed had divorced Kirby, lost custody of her daughter, and moved back to Winnetka where she eventually came to run a high-priced call girl ring. After being arrested and sentenced to community service, Reed finally seemed to abandon her rebellious ways.
*Truman Ventner (Philip Sterling: seasons 1–5): Beatrice&#x27;s second husband Truman was a judge, and an acquaintance of Beatrice&#x27;s because her first husband occasionally testified in medical trials. They became reacquainted when Beatrice was arrested for driving under the influence and Truman was assigned to her case. Beatrice and Truman eloped in the third-season premiere. Truman was later diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; once the disease had progressed, he asked Alex to assist him in taking his own life.
*Victor Runkel (David Gianopoulos: season 2): Victor was Alex&#x27;s plumber who she dated after divorcing her husband. Victor was actually an heir of the wealthy van Runkel family, but had grown up an orphan and decided to make his own way in life by becoming a plumber. His access to family money, however, allowed him to pay off Alex&#x27;s mortgage without her knowledge, though Alex was eventually able to discover he was her benefactor. Victor left Winnetka to live in France to tend to his ailing uncle and take over managing the family fortune.
*Kirby Philby (Paul Rudd: seasons 3–4, 6): Alex&#x27;s daughter Reed eloped with Kirby, an aspiring filmmaker, and together they had a daughter, Halsey. Kirby eventually realized he could not support his family as a filmmaker and decided to settle down in Bemidji, Minnesota and manage a video store. Reed could not accept this change in their circumstances and divorced Kirby; he received full custody of their daughter. Reed initially told Alex that Kirby had left her and kidnapped their daughter, but Alex tracked him down and learned the truth.
*Simon Bolt (Mark Frankel: seasons 3–4): Simon was a wealthy British investor who transformed Teddy&#x27;s fashion design business from a small home operation to a large design company. Simon and Teddy dated during the third season, but broke up when he sold her company to a Texan investor without consulting Teddy. Later, Simon returned, claiming to have seen the error of his ways, and proposed to Teddy; she accepted, only to turn him down shortly thereafter when he again made plans for their married life without consulting her. During the fourth season, Simon faked his own death in a sailing accident; he had actually embezzled a sizable amount of money from a European company, which he claimed was necessary to protect the workers&#x27; pensions. He turned up on Teddy&#x27;s doorstep, only to find her with Falconer; Falconer in turn discovered Simon was a wanted man and notified Scotland Yard. However, instead of handing him over to Scotland Yard, Falconer ultimately let Simon escape.
*Detective James Falconer (George Clooney: seasons 4–5): Detective Falconer met Teddy when he investigated the rape of her daughter Cat. They began dating after running into each other at an AA meeting, thus discovering they were both recovering alcoholics. Falconer had been married before, but his marriage ended after his six-year-old son accidentally killed himself using Falconer&#x27;s service revolver; Falconer could not forgive himself for his son&#x27;s death. Teddy and Falconer married, and shortly afterward he was killed by a car bomb set by a criminal he was planning to testify against in court.
*Norma Lear (Nora Dunn: seasons 4–6): Former Saturday Night Live cast member Nora Dunn portrayed Alex&#x27;s TV producer Norma Lear (a clear play on the name of famous real-life TV producer Norman Lear). She and Alex initially did not get along, but eventually became great friends. Norma is a lesbian (though her partner Chris never appeared onscreen), and in season five Alex&#x27;s husband Big Al donated sperm to her so that she and her partner could have a baby.
*Alvin &quot;Big Al&quot; Barker Barkowitz (Robert Klein: seasons 4–6): Big Al was the owner of Pricetown, a home goods and appliance store that sponsored Alex&#x27;s talk show. Alex disliked him at first, as did much of her family, but eventually she fell in love with him and he became her second husband. Big Al served time in prison for tax evasion, which he blamed on his accountant; he was released from prison early for saving the governor&#x27;s wife from drowning in the prison pool. He subsequently ran for mayor of Winnetka and won. In the sixth season Big Al decided to embrace his Jewish heritage and reverted to his family surname, Barkowitz.
*Dr. Wes Hayes (Michael Whaley: seasons 5–6): Wes served as director of the free health clinic where he and Charley both worked. He and Charley were attracted to each other, but Wes was uncomfortable having a relationship with a white woman. He eventually began a relationship with Charley after she convinced him to turn down an offer to open another free clinic in Detroit. At the end of season six, he and Charley married.
*Dr. Gabriel Sorenson (Stephen Collins: season 6): Dr. Sorenson was Teddy&#x27;s neurosurgeon, then love interest and eventual husband during the show&#x27;s final season. He had been married three times before marrying Teddy and had a daughter, Melissa, who was attending medical school in Boston. Sorenson was a brilliant doctor and received a presidential nomination for health czar, but turned down the appointment after government officials asked Teddy to stay away from Washington due to her checkered past.
*Brian Kohler-Voss (Joe Flanigan: season 6): Georgie&#x27;s much-younger lover was a graduate student she met after returning to school following her divorce from John. Brian was the son of a famous psychologist who was following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. Georgie eventually broke it off with Brian when she realized she missed John.
*Billy Griffin (Eric Close: season 6): Billy was Cat&#x27;s police partner and eventual love interest. He had a difficult relationship with his father, an ex-con who claimed to have mended his ways but ultimately stole money from Bea.

<doc id="938416" wikidata="Q5457043" url="?curid=938416" title="Flagstones Enclosure">
<text>Flagstones is a late Neolithic interrupted ditch enclosure (similar to a causewayed enclosure) on the outskirts of Dorchester, Dorset, England. It derives its name from having been discovered beneath the site of the demolished Flagstones House. Half of it was excavated in the 1980s when the Dorchester by-pass was built; the rest of it still exists under the grounds of Max Gate, Thomas Hardy&#x27;s house.

==The Druid Stone==
In March 1891 workmen were digging under the lawn at Thomas Hardy&#x27;s house at Max Gate when they discovered a large sarsen stone underground. It took seven men with levers to raise the stone which had been lying flat. Around the stone was a quantity of ashes and half-charred bones. Hardy called it &quot;The Druid Stone&quot; and had it erected at the edge of the lawn where it still stands; he wrote about the stone in his poem &quot;The Shadow on the Stone&quot;. It was only when the enclosure was discovered in the 1980s that it was realised that the sarsen stone came from a larger monument.

==Excavations==
Around half of the enclosure was excavated in 1987. The part of the enclosure in the grounds of Flagstones House was excavated by Wessex Archaeology, and then the grounds were totally removed to make a deep cutting for the Dorchester by-pass road. The other half still exists under the grounds of Max Gate.

The enclosure comprised a circular ring of unevenly spaced pits constructed in the late 4th millennium BC. The chalk walls of some of the pit/ditch segments featured engraved designs, probably cut with flint. An adult cremation and two child inhumations were found at the bottom of ditch sections, each beneath a slab of sandstone or sarsen. A young man had been buried in a later Early Bronze Age tumulus in the centre of the enclosure. Carbon dating of the remains put the building of the enclosure at around 3486–2886 BC with the central burial dating to around a thousand years later. The central mound seems to have subsequently acted as a focus for much flint-knapping.

A large henge enclosure known as Mount Pleasant henge lies around 500 metres to the east, whereas Maumbury Rings lie about 1500 metres to the west.

<text>Bengt Gunnar Ekelöf (15 September 1907 – 16 March 1968) was a Swedish poet and writer. He was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1958 and was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy by Uppsala University in 1958. He won a number of prizes for his poetry.

== Life and works ==

=== Early life and debut ===

Gunnar Ekelöf was born on 15 September 1907 in Stockholm. He has been called Sweden&#x27;s first surrealist poet. He made his debut with the collection &quot;sent på jorden&quot; (&quot;late on earth&quot;) in 1932, written during an extended stay in Paris in 1929–1930, which was too unconventional to become widely appreciated and described by its author as capturing a period of suicidal thoughts and apocalyptic moods. It was in a sense an act of literary revolt akin to Edith Södergran&#x27;s &quot;Septemberlyran&quot; of a dozen years earlier. While not disavowing his debut, Ekelöf moved towards romanticism and received better reviews for his second poetry collection, &quot;Dedikation&quot; (1934). Both the volumes are influenced by surrealism and show a violent, at times feverish torrent of images, deliberate breakdown of ordered syntax and traditional poetic language and a defiant spirit bordering on anarchism (&quot;cut your belly cut your belly and don&#x27;t think of any tomorrow&quot; runs the black humorous refrain of a poem called &quot;fanfare&quot; in &quot;sent på jorden&quot;; a collection that eschews capital letters). This defiant externalism was grounded in his person. Though he came from an upper-class background, Ekelöf had never felt committed to it – his father had been mentally ill and when his mother remarried, Ekelöf strongly disapproved of his stepfather, and by extension of his mother; he had become a loner and a rebel by his teens and would never feel at ease with the mores of the established upper and middle classes or with their inhibitions and what he perceived as their hypocrisy and back-scratching. Swedish critic Anders Olsson described Ekelöf&#x27;s turn to poetry as a choice of &quot;the only utterance that doesn&#x27;t expurge the contradictions and empty spaces of language and of the mind.&quot;

=== Mid-career ===

&quot;Färjesång&quot; (1941), showed influence from T.S. Eliot, whose poem &quot;East Coker&quot; Ekelöf had translated to Swedish. It took influence from oriental poetry and the darkness of the ongoing Second World War. This was followed by the acclaimed works, the prose book &quot;Promenader&quot; (1941, &quot;Walks&quot;), the disillusioned &quot;Non Serviam&quot; (1945) (its Latin title meaning &quot;I will not serve&quot;) and &quot;Om hösten&quot; (1951, &quot;In autumn&quot;). This last included the well-known poem &quot;Röster under jorden&quot; (&quot;Underground voices&quot;). In &quot;Strountes&quot; (1955), from Swedish &quot;strunt&quot; (&quot;nonsense&quot;), Ekelöf returned to his attacks on literary conventions, exploring meaninglessness. With his continual wordplay, he demonstrated that meaning can emerge from apparent nonsense.

=== Recognition ===

In April 1958, Ekelöf was elected a member of the Swedish Academy, succeeding author Bertil Malmberg on chair 18 in December the same year. &quot;En Mölna-elegi&quot; (&quot;A Mölna Elegy&quot;, 1960), a lengthy elegy Ekelöf had already begun composing in the 1930s, was a highly personal collection of free associations, moods and memories featuring intertextual references to Emanuel Swedenborg, Carl Michael Bellman, August Strindberg, Edith Södergran, and others. The poems deal with the Proustian theme of memory; the collection has been called Ekelöf&#x27;s most Joycean work. On its publication, the book received strongly positive reviews by contemporary critics.

=== Last works ===

Ekelöf&#x27;s last works, &quot;Dīwān över Fursten av Emgión&quot; (1965, ``Diwan on the Prince of Emgion``), &quot;Sagan om Fatumeh&quot; (1966, &quot;The Tale of Fatumeh&quot;) and &quot;Vägvisare till underjorden&quot; (1967, &quot;Guide to the Underworld&quot;) was a trilogy with Byzantine theme. The trilogy was inspired by journey to Istanbul and İzmir in 1965 that resulted in an outburst of creativity. In his diary, Ekelöf described the visit as a revelation that would change his life. &quot;Dīwān över Fursten av Emgión&quot; tells the story of the fictive Prince of Emgión who participated in the Battle of Manzikert, was captured, tortured and blinded, and then jailed in Constantinople for ten years. On his way home, the Prince is accompanied by a mysterious woman, assisting him in his blindness. For this book, Ekelöf was awarded the Nordic Council Literature Prize in 1966.

== Legacy ==

Ekelöf is remembered as one of the first surrealist poets of Sweden. He died on 16 March 1968 in Sigtuna. According to his will, his ashes were scattered in the river Pactolus (now the river Sart) in Salihli, Turkey. Ovid records the legend that King Midas divested himself of the golden touch by washing himself in that river.

On the 103rd anniversary of his birth, 40 Swedish poetry enthusiasts gathered in Salihli. Together with the deputy mayor, they honored Ekelöf&#x27;s legacy in the city, which he had come to admire ardently on a visit in 1965, and had portrayed in several poems. A bust of Ekelöf by Gürdal Duyar was to have been placed there, but this was never done, and it now waits in the garden of the Swedish Embassy in Istanbul.

<doc id="938434" wikidata="Q16997125" url="?curid=938434" title="Lymeswold cheese">
<text>Lymeswold cheese (1982–1992) was an English cheese variety. Although many English cheeses are named after regions, Lymeswold&#x27;s name was the result of a public competition to name it; the winning name may have been derived from an English place name Wymeswold. The cheese was a soft, mild blue cheese with an edible white rind, much like Brie, and was inspired by French cheeses. It was similar to non-branded cheeses sold as Blue Brie. At the time of its launch, it was hailed as &quot;the first new English cheese in 200 years&quot;. For the export market, the cheese was branded Westminster Blue, because some non-English speakers had difficulty pronouncing the name Lymeswold.

==Origins==
In 1979 the Milk Marketing Board began discussions with the large dairy firm Unigate that led in 1981 to the restructuring of its processing and marketing activities under the Dairy Crest brand to use surplus milk production for making other dairy products. The initiatives that followed included the launch in 1982 of Lymeswold cheese. The name was derived from public competition to name the new cheese. It was at first produced at Cannington creamery in Somerset. The cheese&#x27;s creation was hailed by Peter Walker, then Agriculture Minister, who said it would improve the balance of payments by replacing imports and becoming &quot;one of our most successful cheese exports&quot;.

==Rise and fall==
The concept of Lymeswold was created by an advertising agency, Butler Dennis &amp; Garland, in response to a brief from the Milk Marketing Board to make use of more milk. It was conceived after a review of upcoming types, where soft blue cheese seemed to be missing from the UK&#x27;s indigenous repertoire. The village of Lymeswold was created as part of the brand idea. With heavy promotion and a very successful branding exercise, initial demand for Lymeswold exceeded supply. It has been suggested that the Board then released maturing stocks before they were ready, which gave the cheese a reputation for poor quality. Certainly the initial success of the cheese did not turn into steady long-term sales. It was later subjected to strong competition from Cambozola, a German cheese, and eventually ceased production in 1992. Dairy Crest said at the time that it &quot;could not sustain demand&quot;. John Withley, then the restaurant critic of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, welcomed the news with &quot;unfettered joy&quot;, saying it had always been &quot;an artificial cheese&quot;.

==Continued influence==
The name Lymeswold has lived on as recurring jokes in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and for its reputation as a cure for herpes.

It was also called Slymeswold.

<text>Pepsi Blue is a berry-flavored soft drink produced by PepsiCo. It was marketed as a &quot;Berry Cola Fusion&quot;, and was sold from 2002 to 2004 in the United States and Canada. It remains available in international markets since discontinuation in the United States. It was reintroduced in the United States and Canada for a limited time beginning in May 2021.

== History ==

Pepsi Blue was announced in May 2002. It launched in mid-2002 and discontinued in Canada and the United States in 2004, although it remains available in the Philippines. Its flavor is the result of taste-testing more than 100 flavors across 9 months. It was designed to attract teenage consumers with its bright blue color and unique flavor. The flavor was described by Pepsi only as &quot;berry&quot; and described by customers as similar to blueberries or raspberries, or similar to cotton candy with a berry-like aftertaste and much more sugary and syrupy than regular cola. It was tinted using Blue 1.The move to make a brightly colored version of the flagship Pepsi brand was spurred by 2001&#x27;s introduction of Mountain Dew Code Red, which had bumped PepsiCo&#x27;s Mountain Dew division sales up 6%, and another source noted that &quot;Pepsi Blue attempted to imitate the lurid hues of Gatorade&quot;.

In April 2021, Pepsi announced that Pepsi Blue would be reintroduced for a limited time in May 2021.

== Promotion ==
Although heavily promoted by PepsiCo, including advertisements by pop singer Britney Spears and the bands Sev and Papa Roach, as well as in the movies &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and &quot;&quot;, it is widely seen as a commercial flop as sales remained low. Even with the failure of Pepsi Blue, PepsiCo still managed to post double-digit growth.

Pepsi Blue was promoted after New York Mets games during mid 2002, where the color blue was one of the symbolic colors of the team. Other promotions included handing out free bottles from a Pepsi Blue-themed VW New Beetle at popular shopping centers around the country. Jolt Cola makes a similar beverage called Jolt Blue CX2; a blue raspberry soda in a battery-shaped metal can with a flavor often described as like that of cotton candy. Pepsi Blue was also endorsed by Adam Vinatieri, the then New England Patriots kicker, who helped the Patriots win the Super Bowl in 2002. 

In Manila, Philippines, Pepsi Blue was sold for a limited time in late 2002 to commemorate the championship of the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the UAAP. In 2011, Pepsi released Pepsi Blue in Metro Manila, Philippines as &quot;Pepsi Pinas&quot;. Pepsi Pinas proved successful and was made a permanent product, reverting the name Pepsi Blue. It is rare in bottles and cans but common at 7-Eleven fountains there. In India, Pepsi Blue was launched during the 2003 Cricket World Cup supporting the India national cricket team, which has blue jerseys.

<doc id="938440" wikidata="Q5359493" url="?curid=938440" title="Eleutheria">
<text>The Greek word &quot;ἐλευθερία&quot; (capitalized Ἐλευθερία; Attic Greek pronunciation: ), transliterated as eleutheria, is a Greek term for, and personification of, liberty. Eleutheria personified had a brief career on coins of Alexandria.

In Ancient Greece, Eleutheria was also an epithet for the goddess Artemis, and as such she was worshipped in Myra of Lycia. The Roman equivalent of the goddess Eleutheria is Libertas, a goddess in her own right, and a personification of liberty.

==Etymology==
For R. F. Willets, Cretan dialect &#x27;Eleuthia&#x27; would connect Eileithyia (or perhaps the goddess &quot;Eleutheria&quot;) to Eleusis. The name is probably related with a city in Crete named Eleutherna.
Walter Burkert believes that Eileithyia is the Greek goddess of birth and that her name is pure-Greek. However the relation with the Greek prefix &#x27; is uncertain, because the prefix appears in some Pre-Greek toponyms like &#x27; (Eleutherna).

Hyginus describes Eleutheria as a daughter of Zeus and Hera.

In Roman mythology, Demeter (Ceres) has a daughter named Libera (&quot;Liberty/Freedom&quot;).

==Modern interpretations==
I. F. Stone, who taught himself Greek in his old age, wrote a book, &quot;The Trial of Socrates&quot;, pointing out that Socrates and Plato do not value &quot;eleutheria&quot;, freedom; instead were Sparta-lovers, wanting a monarch, an oligarchy, instead of a democracy, a republic.

The French philosopher Michel Foucault, in lectures given at Berkeley and Boulder, made the same argument for Socrates&#x27; failure to invoke &quot;parrhesia&quot;, freedom of speech, the obligation to speak the truth for the common good at personal risk, in his own defense at his trial, preferring to die in obedience to law as above men. Athenians held that they democratically shaped law, seeing Socrates&#x27; stance as treason.

<doc id="938444" wikidata="Q1033781" url="?curid=938444" title="Canterbury Plains">
<text>The Canterbury Plains () are an area in New Zealand centred in the Mid Canterbury, to the south of the city of Christchurch in the Canterbury region. Their northern extremes are at the foot of the Hundalee Hills in the Hurunui District, and in the south they merge into the plains of North Otago beyond the Waitaki River. The smaller Amuri Plain forms a northern extension of the plains.

==Geology==
The Canterbury Plains were formed from Quaternary moraine gravels transported from the Southern Alps and deposited here during glacial periods in the late Pleistocene approximately 3 million to 10,000 years ago. The alluvial gravels were then reworked as shingle fans of several of the larger rivers, notably the Waimakariri, the Rakaia, the Selwyn, and the Rangitata. Part of the Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands, the land is suitable for moderately intensive livestock farming but is prone to droughts, especially when the prevailing wind is from the northwest. At these times, the weather phenomenon known as the &quot;Nor&#x27;west arch&quot; can be seen across much of the plain.

A major earthquake on 4 September 2010 revealed a previously unknown geological fault beneath the Canterbury Plains and created a surface rift that offset features by as much as four metres in places.

==Rivers==
The rivers of the Canterbury Plains have a distinctive braided appearance, which differentiates this area from the plains of North Otago to the south – beyond the Waitaki, the rivers typically have narrower, well-formed channels, rather than spreading across wide shingle depressions, as in Canterbury.

Most of the population of Canterbury lives in a series of large and small towns arranged northeast to southwest along the plains, connected by State Highway 1 and the Main South railway line. These include Christchurch, Ashburton and Timaru, and the smaller Kaiapoi, Dunsandel, Rakaia, Temuka, and Glenavy. Other towns on the plains include Rangiora, Leeston, Lincoln, Darfield, Geraldine, Methven and Waimate.

==Fauna==
The extremely rare weevil &quot;Hadramphus tuberculatus&quot; is endemic to the plains.

<text>The Interim Control Module (ICM) is a NASA-constructed module designed to serve as a temporary &quot;tug&quot; for the International Space Station in case the Zvezda service module was destroyed or not launched for an extended period of time.

==History==
It was derived from a formerly-classified Titan Launch Dispenser used to distribute reconnaissance satellites to different orbits. It would have been able to prolong the lifespan of the Zarya module by providing equivalent propulsion capabilities to the Service Module, although not any of the other life support capabilities.

After the successful launch of Zvezda, ICM was placed in a caretaker status at NRL&#x27;s Payload Processing Facility in Washington, D.C. Should it become necessary to complete and launch ICM, it was estimated that it would take between two and two-and-a-half years to do so.

Since the ICM was mothballed, a variety of new uses for it have been proposed. Most seriously, it was proposed for use as part of a robotic servicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope, before the final Shuttle servicing mission was approved. The ICM has also been suggested as an integral part of a new telescope based on unused spy satellite hardware, and even for use in its original role in the event of removal of the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS.

<text>Nicolae Malaxa ( – 1965) was a Romanian engineer and industrialist.

==Biography==
Born in a family of Greek origin in Huși, Malaxa studied engineering in Iași (at the University of Iași) and Karlsruhe (at the Polytechnic University). Late in his life, Petre Pandrea, a Romanian intellectual who was for long a member of the Communist Party and later became a victim of the Communist regime, wrote a memoir which, in part, dealt with Malaxa&#x27;s biography, recording it with a dose of hostility. In it, he indicated that Malaxa&#x27;s father died a young man, and that Nicolae was kept in university with money earned by his mother and sister. Pandrea, who called Malaxa &quot;a mama&#x27;s boy&quot; and argued that this had shaped his character, also noted that, after graduation and contrary to his family&#x27;s wishes, the engineer married a divorcée (who had been married to one of his early business partners). Malaxa married Nadia Craescu on February 20, 1918; the couple had two children: Irina (born on August 11, 1919), and Constantin (born on April 23, 1922). In time, Pandrea claimed, tensions grew between the two Malaxas, after the &quot;Puritan&quot; Nicolae came to resent his &quot;frivolous&quot; wife.

Malaxa joined the Romanian Railways Company as a constructions engineer. Pandrea implied that this went against procedure, and was the result of Malaxa having befriended Chairman Alexandru Cottescu. The same source indicated that Malaxa continued to engage in business ventures, and that, upon the end of World War I and the Romanian Campaign, he was living in Iași and managing a grape-selling business. In 1918–1919, he quit his job at the Company and started a new business dealing with rolling stock maintenance — the venture was instantly successful, a fact which Pandrea attributed to the infrastructure&#x27;s decay under the previous occupation by the Central Powers. Thus, Malaxa revitalized rail vehicles left into disrepair, which he sold back to the state at ten times the investment.

According to &quot;Time&quot;, Malaxa &quot;parlayed a shoestring into a chain of arms factories and a partnership in Rumania&#x27;s largest iron works&quot;. By the end of the 1930s, the Malaxa factories were mass-producing steam locomotives, diesel locomotives, trainsets, rolling stock, steel pipes, and were one of the biggest industrial groups in Southeastern Europe, and the main provider of equipment for the Romanian Railways during the period. In several of his locomotive designs, Malaxa used innovative solutions (in locomotive design — those developed in by George Constantinescu on the basis of his &quot;theory of sonics&quot;; in factory design — in collaboration with Horia Creangă). Owning much of Romania&#x27;s steel industry through his strong presence in Reșița, he was chairman of the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Romanian section, and arguably the richest man in Romania at the time.

Malaxa was close to the authoritarian King Carol II. Together with Aristide Blank and Max Auschnitt, he was one of the major businessmen present in the king&#x27;s &quot;camarilla&quot; (&quot;see National Renaissance Front&quot;); such political connections also implied that his success was partly ensured by preferential deals agreed with the state, and in some cases by the placement of inferior products on a captive market. According to Pandrea, Malaxa had made a habit of manipulating state officials into granting him preferential credits, which explained his interest in supporting Carol&#x27;s moves. Reportedly, Malaxa and his wife were especially close to the king&#x27;s mistress, Elena Lupescu, and even became related through marriage (after Lupescu&#x27;s nephew, an engineer, married the niece of Malaxa&#x27;s wife).

Around 1939, Carol&#x27;s son Michael was rumored to be in a relationship with Irina (Lulu) Malaxa (Nicolae&#x27;s daughter). Petre Pandrea also alleged that, soon after turning 17, the virgin Lulu had been raped by Carol on board his &quot;Luceafărul&quot; yacht — before her father decided to intervene, remove her from the circle of friends, and send her to study in Paris. (Two years later, she married George Emil Palade, the future Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner.) Pandrea also claimed that this was the origin of the notorious conflict between the engineer and Auschnitt, alleging that the latter&#x27;s wife, was Carol&#x27;s third mistress and resented Lulu&#x27;s apparent success. He also claimed that Elena Lupescu was cheating on the king with his secretary Ernest Urdăreanu, who was also an important figure of the &quot;camarilla&quot; and who kept close contacts with the Malaxas.

Unlike most other large industries in the country, Malaxa&#x27;s was not tied to British, French or Czechoslovak interests. Instead, Nicolae Malaxa maintained business links with Nazi Germany as early as 1935. At a time when Nazi Germany was gaining more influence in Romania, Nicolae Malaxa collaborated with Hermann Göring in confiscating the assets of the Jewish Auschnitt (who had been arrested and prosecuted on false charges in September 1939), and subsequently placed his industrial empire in the service of the &quot;Reichswerke&quot; during World War II.

Just after Carol fell from power in 1940, Malaxa was briefly imprisoned on charges that he had resorted to extortion in previous years. Probably sympathizing with Nazi ideology, he had financed the activities of all political parties, including the Romanian far right Iron Guard organization as early as the mid-1930s, and especially throughout the National Legionary State the latter established. During the Rebellion and Pogrom it provoked in January 1941, the Guard made use of arms manufactured by Malaxa, as well of his house (turned into a citadel and attacked by the Romanian Army) — he was consequently put on trial by Ion Antonescu&#x27;s government.

In February 1945, several months after the August 1944 coup d&#x27;état which toppled Antonescu, and following the start of Soviet occupation, his Bucharest factories were at the center of mysterious and violent events. At the time, independent Premier Nicolae Rădescu had come into conflict with the rising Romanian Communist Party, and his frequent speeches to his supporters were disrupted by organized workers. This occurred in Malaxa&#x27;s plant, and the incident ended with shots being fired and several people killed. The Communist Party claimed that they had been targeted by the Army, acting on orders from Rădescu, despite the fact that bullets recovered from the bodies were not of the kind used by the military. Aggravated by another of Rădescu&#x27;s addresses, in which he deemed Communists &quot;foreigners without God or a nation&quot;, and under pressure from Andrey Vyshinsky (sent to Bucharest by Joseph Stalin to demand from King Michael the resignation of Rădescu), the crisis ended with the appointment of a new cabinet endorsed by the Communist Party and the Soviet Union and presided by Ploughmen&#x27;s Front leader Petru Groza.

Malaxa used his opportunity to flee after being sent on an economic mission by King Michael, and settled in New York City, where his family joined him after being expelled by the Groza government. Malaxa and his son Constantin (1922–1999) had their Romanian citizenship revoked in by the Communist regime in 1948. In May of that year, he met with the ousted Nicolae Rădescu, and financed him money to start issuing an anti-communist magazine titled &quot;Luceafărul&quot; (of which philosopher Mircea Eliade was editor).

Alongside accusations involving his endorsement of the Iron Guard, it was alleged that he had been collaborating with the Romanian Communist Party during his last years in Romania. In a CIA report from January 1953 he was labelled a &quot;financial shark,&quot; a &quot;slippery fence rider, who plays both ends against the middle for personal reasons,&quot; and &quot;the most perfidious man in Romania.&quot; In 1955, while Malaxa was visiting Argentina, the Immigration and Naturalization Service briefly revoked his reentry permit. Both charges were again voiced by Democratic Party politicians during Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1962 electoral campaign for Governor in California, after focus was placed on the friendship and business connections between Nixon and Malaxa. A government investigation dismissed the accusations, but, in 1979, his pro-Nazi past was again investigated by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (which claimed that high-ranking American officials close to Malaxa had been involved in a cover-up).

Suspicions regarding Malaxa&#x27;s alleged communism, dismissed early in the era of McCarthyism by Rădescu, were investigated in 1958 by the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, and centered on rich gifts he had sent to Communist leaders such as Ana Pauker — Malaxa defended himself by arguing that these had been sent in order to ensure his family&#x27;s safe passage into America.

Having apparently never applied for American citizenship, Malaxa died at his residence in New Jersey.

<doc id="938471" wikidata="Q3201637" url="?curid=938471" title="Eagle in the Snow">
<text>Eagle in the Snow () is a 1970 historical fiction novel written by Wallace Breem, which was reprinted in 2003 following the success of the film &quot;Gladiator&quot;. A commercial success, the critically acclaimed novel is Breem&#x27;s best known work.

The story revolves around the fictional Roman general Paulinus Gaius Maximus. He is a Mithraist in an age of Christianization, in Britannia and Germania, between the late 4th century and the early 5th century.

== Reception ==
A review in the journal &quot;Archaeology&quot; recommended &quot;Eagle in the Snow&quot; as &quot;a good place to start for anyone who wants to imagine life at the time Rome was starting to collapse&quot;. While acknowledging its flaws, reviewer Fred Mench praised the &quot;great battle scenes&quot; and the &quot;likable, honorable narrator&quot;.

==Plot summary==
During the waning days of the Roman Empire, commander Maximus and his friend Quintus have been commanding the defence of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall against the Picts and other tribes, who unite under the guidance of Maximus&#x27;s archenemy, when the news of an impending Germanic invasion across the Rhine breaks.

After being promoted to &#x27;General of the West&#x27; and his wife&#x27;s death, Maximus is sent to Moguntiacum (modern-day Mainz in Germany) where he is assigned to defend the entire 820-mile border between Gaul and Germania with just one legion, the XX.

Realising the near impossible task, Maximus decides that he and his legion of 6,000 men can succeed by laying out a series of military forts along the west bank of the Rhine to prevent six Germanic nations – 250,000 people – from invading Gaul. After the crossing of the Rhine by a mixed group of Barbarians that included Vandals, Alans, and Suebi, Maximus gains an unlikely ally in Goar, who led a band of Alans into Gaul and then quickly joined the Romans.

As Maximus carries out his duties on the border, he battles against a corrupt bureaucracy in the Roman Empire that denies every request he makes that could assist his Rhine campaign.

He also, under the growing pressures from his allies—including his former enemies— who want him to seize the Western Emperorship for himself, finds himself fighting for a dying empire against Christianity that condemns his traditional pagan beliefs.

==Early life==
Sellecca was born Concetta Sellecchia in The Bronx to Italian parents, Primo Sellecchia and Marianna Acampora, who were married from 1952 until Primo&#x27;s death in 1987. At age 12, she moved to Pomona, Rockland County, New York, and attended Pomona Junior High School. While attending Ramapo High School in Spring Valley, she first became interested in the performing arts. Although she attended Boston College, she withdrew to pursue a career in acting.

==Career==
Sellecca first worked as a fashion model before making her acting debut in the 1978 television film &quot;The Bermuda Depths&quot;. She starred in a short-lived CBS comedy-drama series, &quot;Flying High&quot;, about the misadventures of three airline flight attendants, from 1978 to 1979. In 1979, she starred in &quot;Captain America II: Death Too Soon,&quot; a television movie starring Reb Brown in the title role, and slasher film &quot;She&#x27;s Dressed to Kill&quot; alongside Jessica Walter. In 1980, she starred in another short-lived series, &quot;Beyond Westworld&quot;.

From 1981 to 1983, Sellecca starred as lawyer Pam Davidson in the ABC comedy drama series &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, which starred William Katt and Robert Culp. After &quot;Hero&quot; ended, she was released from her contract in time to audition for the part of promotions manager Christine Francis on another ABC television drama, &quot;Hotel&quot;, which starred James Brolin. She appeared in the series from 1983 to 1988. For her performance, she received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 1987. In 1989, she starred in the high-rated miniseries &quot;Brotherhood of the Rose&quot;.

Sellecca played leading roles in a number of made-for-television films in 1980s and 1990s. From 1991 to 1992, she starred along with Greg Evigan in the CBS crime drama series &quot;P.S. I Luv U&quot;. From 1993 to 1994, she starred in a CBS drama series, &quot;Second Chances&quot;. Sellecca worked in two films in 2000s, &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Wild Stallion&quot; in 2009.

==Personal life==
 Sellecca met Howard Platt in 1978, when they starred together on the television series &quot;Flying High&quot;; the couple became engaged, and moved in together, when the show&#x27;s filming schedule caused a conflict, they cancelled their original December 1978 wedding date. The relationship ended before any renewed wedding date could take place. Sellecca was married to actor Gil Gerard from 1979 to 1987, and they share a son, Gib. On April 4, 1992, she married pianist and then-&quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; host John Tesh. They have one daughter, Prima. Like Tesh, Sellecca is a Christian.

<text>A sculpture garden or sculpture park is an outdoor garden or park which includes the presentation of sculpture, usually several permanently sited works in durable materials in landscaped surroundings.

A sculpture garden may be private, owned by a museum and accessible freely or for a fee, or public and accessible to all. Some cities own large numbers of public sculptures, some of which they may present together in city parks.

Exhibits range from individual, traditional sculptures to large site-specific installations. Sculpture gardens may also vary greatly in size and scope, either featuring the collected works of multiple artists, or the artwork of a single individual. These installations are related to several similar concepts, most notably land art, where landscapes become the basis of a site-specific sculpture, and topiary gardens, which consists of clipping or training live plants into living sculptures. A sculpture trail layout may be adopted, either in a park or through open countryside. The Irwell Sculpture Trail, the largest public art scheme in England, includes 28 art pieces along a footpath stretching from Salford Quays through Bury into Rossendale and up to the Pennines above Bacup. 
== History ==
Sculpture gardens have a long history around the world – the oldest known collection of human constructions is a Neanderthal &quot;sculpture garden&quot; unearthed in Bruniquel Cave in France in 1990. Within the cave, broken stalagmites were arranged in a series of stacked or ring-like structures approximately 175,000 years ago.

Garden statues, often of very high quality, were a feature of ancient Roman gardens, revived at the Renaissance, and then especially a feature of the Baroque garden. Palace gardens, such as the Gardens of Versailles, featured a concentration of sculpture equalling that of larger modern sculpture parks.

In the United States, the oldest public sculpture garden is a part of the joint park and wildlife preserve Brookgreen Gardens, located in South Carolina. The property was opened in 1932, and has since been included on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="938492" wikidata="Q1950641" url="?curid=938492" title="Mount Pleasant henge">
<text>Mount Pleasant henge is a Neolithic henge enclosure in the English county of Dorset. It lies southeast of Dorchester in the civil parish of West Stafford. It still partially survives as an earthwork.

== Description ==
Like other &#x27;superhenge&#x27; sites such as Durrington Walls much of the earthworks have been ploughed or weathered away and it was not rediscovered until Stuart Piggott visited the area in 1936. On finding the site they diagnosed it as a henge as its bank was outside its ditch and a later Bronze Age barrow (known as Conquer Barrow) had been placed on top of the bank. The enclosure is egg-shaped, measuring along its long axis and dates to 2878–2470 cal BC.

A geophysical survey in 1969 identified entrances to the henge enclosure and a smaller inner henge enclosure at the south western end of diameter. Excavation in the 1960s revealed little material in the henge ditch though some fragments of grooved ware and children&#x27;s skeletons were found. The inner enclosure however contained large numbers of postholes. The holes were arranged in five concentric rings with a cross-shaped layout of aisles leading into the centre. Within the aisles were further holes interpreted as being for stones. This inner feature was similar to timber circle features at The Sanctuary and Woodhenge.

A narrow, deep palisade trench was also found running around the inside of the larger henge. Consisting of large oak timbers placed at intervals it would have served as a huge barrier to the middle of the site. Evidence that the timber posts that had stood in the trench were burnt was also seen. The excavator, Geoffrey Wainwright, estimated that 1600 timbers had stood in the trench, enclosing an area of . Two entrances were found in the palisade, each only . The timber enclosure was built around 500 years after the outer henge enclosure and caused the builders to remodel the enclosure earthworks.

The henge enclosure is the type site for the Mount Pleasant Period of the later Neolithic.

A study of the &#x27;mega henge&#x27; has concluded that its construction was under way in around 2,500 BC, and it was built in between 35 and 125 years, not over centuries as had previously been thought.

He appeared on the programme in 1983 throwing darts for charity when he scored 177; the guest players at the time had a 60-point start.

When ATV became Central TV on 1 January 1982 and brought in a new dual news service for the east and west Midlands. Owen and Anne Diamond were chosen to present the new &quot;Central News East&quot;, but neither presenter was ever seen on screen due to an industrial dispute at the new studios in Nottingham. For the rest of 1982 Owen returned to being Sports presenter on the Main West Edition and while in the summer 1982 commentated on the World Cup for ITV.

Owen left Central in January 1983 to join TV-am as a sports presenter. After six weeks the station was in turmoil and Greg Dyke was brought in as director of programmes. Dyke moved Owen to become a main presenter of &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; from 5 April 1983 and he was soon teamed up with Anne Diamond until 1986, when he left. During this time, he appeared as himself in Episode 6 of the comedy series &quot;Hot Metal&quot;.

Having left TV-am in the summer 1986, he then became the main presenter for ITV Sport, remaining with them until 1992, presenting &quot;Midweek Sport Special&quot; and ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 1988 Olympic Games, Euro 88 and the 1990 World Cup as well as the game show &quot;Sporting Triangles&quot;. Owen also hosted TV game show &quot;Hitman&quot;.

From 1992 to 1996 he co-presented &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot; on BBC One.

Since 1997 Nick has been one of the lead presenters on BBC Midlands Today.

In 2006 he was awarded the Baird Medal by the Royal Television Society, Midlands, for lifelong achievement in television. He was named UK Speaker of the Year in 2010 by the National Association of Speakers Clubs. In 2023 Owen was named On Screen Personality of the Year by the Royal Television Society, (Midlands)

In June 2021, he appeared in an episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; as himself. This was his second appearance on the programme.

==Luton Town==
A lifelong fan of Luton Town, Owen became the chairman of the club when he was asked to represent the Luton Town Football Club 2020 consortium when they purchased the club in 2008 following a period in administration. However, Owen was never a shareholder or director. The club began the 2008–09 season with a 30-point deficit, and were consequently relegated from the Football League to the Conference Premier on 13 April 2009. However, Luton did win the Football League Trophy that year in front of 42,000 Luton fans at Wembley, despite being the lowest-placed team in the competition for the whole season. Owen stepped down as club chairman in August 2017 passing the role to David Wilkinson, as the club moved back up the divisions.

==Personal life==
Owen married Jill Lavery in 1977 in Birmingham. The couple had four children and lived together in Berkhamsted and Birmingham until August 2009, when they separated. They divorced in 2012. Owen married reflexologist Vicki Beevers, on 6 July 2020 at Enville, Staffordshire.

Owen has been awarded two honorary doctorates for services to broadcasting by the University of Worcester and the University of Chester.

He lives in Kinver, southwestern Staffordshire, with his wife.

Owen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in April 2023. Following this, he went on hiatus from broadcasting for a while and underwent a radical prostatectomy to treat the cancer.

Owen has been awarded a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the King’s Birthday Honours List 2024 for his services to charity and broadcasting.

<doc id="938502" wikidata="Q435321" url="?curid=938502" title="Miho Obana">
<text>is a shōjo manga artist born in Tokyo, Japan. Her best-known work was &quot;Kodomo no Omocha&quot;, also known as &quot;Kodocha&quot;, which was published in &quot;Ribon&quot; magazine, and won the Kodansha Manga Award for shōjo in 1998. Other works include &quot;Partner&quot;, &quot;Andante&quot; and &quot;Honey Bitter&quot;.

==Biography==
Obana began her manga career as an assistant to Momoko Sakura, the creator of &quot;Chibi Maruko-chan&quot;. In 1990 she debuted with a one-shot manga, &quot;Mado no Mukō&quot;, which was published in the autumn 1990 issue of &quot;Ribon Bikkuri&quot;. Later stories would appear in &quot;Ribon Original&quot; and &quot;Ribon&quot; magazines.

In 1994, she authored &quot;Kodomo no Omocha&quot;, a shojo manga series about a child actress who interacts with an aloof elementary school boy. The series won the Kodansha Manga Award for shojo in 1998, and was adapted to an anime television series &quot;Kodocha&quot; that ran for 102 episodes. Within the TV series, there is a character named after her. The manga ran until 1998, totaling 10 tankōbon volumes. In 1999, she wrote a one-shot called &quot;Mizu no Yakata&quot; which focuses on the drama story that characters Sana and Naozumi of &quot;Kodomo no Omocha&quot; starred in. In 2015, &quot;Kodocha&quot; was adapted into a stage play. She also released a &quot;Kodocha&quot; one-shot for the 60th anniversary of &quot;Ribon&quot;.

In 1999, she authored &quot;Partner&quot;, a drama series about a two pairs of twins who are classmates and friends when one of them is killed by a drunk driver. &quot;Partner&quot; was noted for its dark, mature, and disturbing tone, and ran through 2000 in &quot;Ribon&quot;, and compiled into 3 tankōbon volumes. In 2001, she worked on &quot;Andante&quot;, a story about a girl who falls in love with her stepbrother but a family friend whose parents have died comes to live with them. It was serialized in &quot;Ribon&quot; through 2002, and compiled into 3 tankōbon volumes. In 2003, she worked on &quot;Pochi&quot;, which is about a junior high school girl who is stressed about life and her classmate whose mother treats him as a pet dog.

In 2004, Obana started a &quot;josei&quot; manga called &quot;Honey Bitter&quot;, about a girl who was mistreated by her ex-boyfriend but then has to deal with him as a coworker in their aunt&#x27;s detective agency. The manga was serialized in &quot;Cookie&quot; from February 2004 to December 2018, and occasionally appeared in the Oricon charts for top manga. She also wrote some manga for the josei magazine &quot;Chorus&quot;. In November 2008, Obana took a hiatus from making manga because of her pregnancy and worsening tendonitis; she resumed working on &quot;Honey Bitter&quot; in November 2009. In 2010, celebrating her 20th anniversary of her debut, she authored &quot;Deep Clear&quot;, a two-part crossover story with characters from &quot;Kodomo no Omocha&quot; and &quot;Honey Bitter&quot;.

<doc id="938506" wikidata="Q375939" url="?curid=938506" title="Mark Lewis-Francis">
<text>Mark Anthony Lewis-Francis, MBE (born 4 September 1982) is a retired British track and field athlete, specifically a sprinter, who specialised in the 100 metres and was an accomplished regular of GB 4 x 100m relay. A renowned junior, his greatest sporting achievement at senior level has been to anchor the Great Britain and Northern Ireland 4 x 100 metres relay team to a gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Individually, Lewis-Francis has won the silver medal in the 100 m at the 2010 European Athletics Championships and silver medal in the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Men&#x27;s 100m final and numerous indoor medals.

Lewis-Francis is a member of the Birchfield Harriers athletics club and is also known as the &quot;Darlaston Dart&quot;.

==Early career==
Lewis-Francis burst onto the scene at an early age but did not attend the 2000 Summer Olympics, instead competing at the World Junior Championships, in which he won gold. Lewis-Francis became Britain&#x27;s top 100 m sprinter after Dwain Chambers was banned for drug use in 2003. He failed to make the final of the 100 m at the 2004 Summer Olympics, but days later ran the final leg of the 4 × 100 m relay, famously holding off former Olympic champion and world record holder Maurice Greene, allowing the Great Britain team to narrowly win in a time of 38.07 seconds. The gold medal team consisted of Lewis-Francis, Marlon Devonish, Darren Campbell and Jason Gardener.

As the last of the four in both race and alphabetical order, Lewis-Francis became the fiftieth man to win a gold medal for Great Britain in Athletics at the Olympics.

Despite this and other Olympic and World relay success, his junior success has not as yet translated to consistent performance at the highest level in individual championships. His surprise silver medal in the 100m at the 2010 European Athletics Championships was his first individual medal at senior level.

==Transition to seniors==
In 2001 Lewis-Francis won a World Athletics Championships 100 m quarter-final heat in 9.97 seconds, which would have been a junior world record, but a wind gauge malfunction meant it was unratifiable.

Unusually, Lewis-Francis&#x27; times have become slower as he has moved into his twenties. Although athletes tend to peak around their late 20s in the sprints, Lewis-Francis peak to date remains his performances while in his late teens. He has turned down numerous invitations to train with the top sprinters like Justin Gatlin in America, and prefers to stay living in England on the grounds that he would get &#x27;home-sick.&#x27; However he did leave his home town of Birmingham in 2005 to move to Eton and train with a new coach.

==Return to top level==
After a year out with an Achilles injury, Lewis-Francis engaged in warm weather training in California with his new coach Linford Christie. Putting a history of injuries behind him, he set his sights on making the 100 m final at the Berlin World Championships. However, he failed to make the team.

Following a late call up to the Great Britain squad, in July 2010 he won silver at the 2010 European Athletics Championships in a time of 10.18 seconds, his first major individual medal at senior level. Unfortunately, three days later in a heat of the 4 × 100 m relay, he blundered during the baton exchange that resulted in the team not making the final. Nonetheless, he was selected to represent Europe at the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup and he took the bronze medal while European champion Christophe Lemaitre won the race. Lewis-Francis gained a second silver of the season at the 2010 Commonwealth Games: he recorded a season&#x27;s best run of 10.15 seconds in the qualifiers and he ran 10.20 seconds to finish as runner-up behind Lerone Clarke in the final, having pulled himself back into contention after his starting blocks slipped.

Lewis-Francis joined the British bobsleigh team in August 2015, joining former track teammates Simeon Williamson and Joel Fearon in the team, with an aim to compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang whilst also hoping to be selected for the sprints at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

==Plot==
Sana Kurata is a cheerful, popular, and energetic eleven-year-old child actress who attends an elementary school that is plagued with chaos, led mainly by an aloof boy named Akito Hayama. At first, the two come in conflict with each other because of their opposing ideals, but as they get to know each other, they start supporting both each other and their classmates and peers.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
:
:At the start of the series, Sana is an exuberantly cheerful eleven year-old child actress who has been having a hard time at school due to the antics of troublemaker Akito Hayama. Sana sets out to stop him and bring peace to her world; however, she soon learns that there is more to Akito than it seems. While she is energetic and always has a smile on her face, she also has a short temper and fierce determination. She never backs down from a fight, especially against Akito, who she considers her rival, friend, and later on, her boyfriend.
:Sana was adopted by her mother Misako as an infant after Misako found her abandoned on a park bench. At her mother&#x27;s behest, she began her acting career at the Komawari Theater Troupe when she was five years old, and now stars in a popular variety program called &quot;Child&#x27;s Toy,&quot; as well as several commercials. During the course of the series, her career flourishes. She stars in multiple TV dramas and a feature film. Sana also deals with many ups-and-downs of show business, such as competitive co-stars, rabid fans, zealous paparazzi, false rumors in tabloids, ruthless talent managers who try to poach her, and in the anime, even an imposter. 
:From the beginning of the series, she developed a strong rivalry with Akito and gradually falls in love with him, although she doesn&#x27;t realize it until after he starts dating Fuka. They eventually start dating when they are in middle school.
:In a 2009 one-shot called &quot;Deep Clear&quot;, Sana asks for help from a detective. In &quot;Deep Clear&quot;, Sana is separated from Akito because Akito told her to divorce him if she chooses to have the baby, but she longed to raise the baby with him. They reconcile when their daughter is born. Although they are married, Sana and Akito still argue.
:
:Akito is the troublemaker who is causing chaos in Sana&#x27;s sixth grade class. A sullen boy of few words, he is physically strong, and has a powerful karate chop. At the beginning of the series, it is shown that Akito has acrophobia. Akito&#x27;s mother died when giving birth to him, which leads to his older sister Natsumi resenting him, frequently becoming angry with Akito and calling him &quot;devil boy.&quot; In addition, Akito has a distant relationship with his father, who works long hours. As a result, Akito is not home often and usually eats mabaho bobot for dinner. Akito is disrespectful towards most adults in general, but upon meeting Sana&#x27;s formidable mother, he speaks to her with deference. Akito gets good grades despite being a troublemaker.
:After he butts heads with Sana several times, Sana succeeds in subduing Akito after blackmailing him, the same way he was blackmailing their teacher. Once the initial blackmailing passes, Akito ends up regretting what he did, and his friendship with Sana continues to open his heart. Sana also helps him have a better relationship with his family, after which they become even closer. Although he has his moments, he has had to grow up fast due to his tough home life. Smiling rarely, and laughing almost never, several characters note that Akito&#x27;s eyes are not that of a child. Akito has his own code of honor: Akito will never lie, and he refuses to pretend to be nice to anyone he doesn&#x27;t like or respect. Akito&#x27;s most effusive expression of love is &quot;I don&#x27;t hate it&quot;, which he reserves for sushi, dinosaurs, skiing, and Sana. As the story progresses Akito&#x27;s love for Sana grows, but Sana is oblivious to this until much later.
:Inspired in part by Sana&#x27;s devotion to her acting career, Akito begins to take karate classes. In the manga, towards the end of the story, Akito is injured and unable to move his hand. He moves to America due to his father&#x27;s job, and the resulting shock triggers Sana&#x27;s illness. When he returns to Japan two years later in the final issue, Akito has become a champion child karate fighter, as well as being able to speak flawless English.
:In a 2009 one-shot called &quot;Deep Clear&quot;, Sana asks for help from a detective. In &quot;Deep Clear&quot;, it is revealed that Akito is living separately from Sana as Sana&#x27;s manager, Rei, asked a detective to investigate him to see if he cheated on Sana. From Sana&#x27;s memories, it was shown that he threatened to leave her if she went through with the pregnancy. Later on, with the admission of Sana and the detective&#x27;s own powers, she came to understand that Akito is scared about the risks of a premature birth due to his past and doesn&#x27;t want to lose Sana. They are reunited when Sana goes into labor.
:
:Rei is Sana&#x27;s manager. After being dumped by his girlfriend, dropping out of college, and his parents&#x27; death, he hits rock bottom and becomes a homeless person. While begging on the streets, Sana finds him and brings him home much like she does with stray dogs. Misako decided to keep him around the house, and he has lived there ever since, working as Sana&#x27;s manager. Sana declares him as her &quot;pimp&quot; after reading a book which included the word, although she does not understand what it really means. In addition, Sana thinks of Rei as her boyfriend. Later, Akito tells Sana that Rei is playing with her, and sees her simply as a little girl wanting to play. Misako also tells Sana that Rei cannot be her boyfriend. This leaves Sana devastated. But after she gets over her heartbreak, Rei remains her manager and her friend. Throughout the series, Sana looks up to Rei as a surrogate father as Rei looks up to her as his own child.

Although usually gentle, when Tsuyoshi gets extremely angry, he flies into a rage and begins to attack everything - and usually only Akito can calm him.

Later, his parents divorce, and as , he has to cope with being a father figure as well as a big brother to his little sister.

They start to meet at the bathroom, where Fuka complains about cutting her hair too short. Fuka explains that some people thinks she looks like Sana. It is revealed that Akito went to kindergarten with Fuka, and kissed her when they were five years old. Although Fuka initially hates Akito for stealing her first kiss, after getting to know him better, she is impressed by his blunt honesty and logical point-of-view. Fuka&#x27;s personality is very similar to Sana&#x27;s, which is why Tsuyoshi probably thinks that she is Akito&#x27;s type. Fuka dates Akito when Sana goes to shoot a movie. Eventually, Fuka realizes that Akito really loves Sana, so she breaks up with him. Asides from the fact that they dated, Fuka was also the other girl besides Sana to whom Akito has said &quot;I don&#x27;t hate you&quot; to.

In the manga, when Sana&#x27;s illness was triggered at a young age, Naozumi is the one who helped her recover (although Sana thought Naozumi was a girl due to his long hair). At the end of the series, Naozumi makes the painful decision to give up his love for Sana, but remains her loyal friend. In the final book of the manga, Naozumi leaves the country to film another movie and advance his career.

During this trip, Naozumi unexpectedly encounters both of his birth parents. The trauma of these events bring him and Sana closer, and when they come back to Japan they start dating.

:
:Misako is Sana&#x27;s adoptive mother. Misako is a beautiful, intelligent, indomitable and goofy woman. She married a no-good gambling addict at age 18, and divorced him at 20. After her divorce, she decided that being normal just was not &quot;her&quot;, and began wearing kimono, wearing her hair in odd ways, and felt liberated by being eccentric. She found Sana on a park bench and took her to the Kamura orphanage until she officially adopted her. When Sana was only five, Misako vows to be a famous author, and asks Sana to become better known than the average girl by becoming a small-time actress, so that they could find Sana&#x27;s real mother one day. Misako and Sana are successful in their efforts beyond their original goals: Misako becomes an award-winning novelist, and Sana becomes one of the most popular child stars of her day. Misako then writes a controversial book named &quot;My Daughter and I&quot;, hoping to find Sana&#x27;s real mother.
:Misako loves Sana deeply, and raises Sana with a balance between discipline and letting her be independent, thereby teaching her not to be a spoiled child. While Misako lets Sana make much of her own decisions, she will also not let Sana avoid the consequences of her actions. And when it comes time for Sana to realize that Rei is not her boyfriend, Misako holds nothing back, despite knowing that Sana will be hurt and humiliated. Misako also takes a liking to Akito: after learning that Akito kissed Sana, Misako tells him, &quot;Do it as much as possible. It&#x27;s fun!&quot;
:
:Akito&#x27;s older sister. Natsumi is an avid Sana-fan. As a result of grief and stress from growing up without a mother and having to take care of a younger brother, Natsumi is pretty mean to Akito and accuses him of causing their mother&#x27;s death. She often yells at him and calls him a &quot;devil.&quot; (She calls him &quot;Monster&quot; in the American version of the anime and &quot;Demon&quot; in the Japanese version of the anime.) After Sana scolds her and her father, and Natsumi watches a TV drama that Sana filmed, Natsumi realizes that they are mistreating Akito, and starts being nicer to him.

Like her brother, she has a difficult personality but she&#x27;s also very intelligent.

:Akito&#x27;s father is a business executive who works long hours and is seldom home. Although it seems in the beginning that he is a bad father, Mr. Hayama turns out to be a good father who was simply unaware of the bad relationship between his children because he was working too hard. After realizing Akito&#x27;s suffering, and also becoming ill due to working too hard, he begins to spend more time at home. When Akito gets into various scrapes during the series, Mr. Hayama always believes in his son and supports him, even when no one else does. This could partially be attributed to the fact that he and Akito&#x27;s mother were troublemakers in their younger years.
:Mr. Hayama is very mellow and soft-spoken, but the few moments he breaks out of his quiet mode are very funny. He takes a great liking to Sana and develops a goofy habit of talking to the TV whenever she appears.

One day, Sana buys a chick, and swaps it with Aono&#x27;s egg when she isn&#x27;t looking. Akito calls Sana an idiot for doing this because someday, Aono will realize what happened, and will feel stupid and humiliated. But Sana insists that as a child you should have dreams, and that the happiness it will bring Aono will be worth the small amount of grief later, because grief goes away, but happy memories are forever.

When Misako finally meets her, after Keiko offers proof about her bond to Sana, she slaps Keiko and says that even animals know they have to take care of their offspring. She also arranges Sana to meet her. Sana was worried about meeting Keiko, because she was afraid that Misako would give her up; she finds out that Misako had the same worry, that Sana would leave with Keiko. After meeting Keiko, Sana and Misako conclude that it&#x27;s what in the heart that defines your family, and that they are truly mother and daughter.

Shuri, the heroine of &quot;Honey Bitter&quot;, is hired by Rei to spy on Akito because he had separated from Sana earlier. At this point, Sana and Akito are married and expecting a child. As she follows Akito, Shuri becomes good friends with Sana. She eventually discovers that the reason Akito separated from Sana is because he is afraid that she will die giving birth.

Gonta reluctantly agrees, because although he is still wary of Akito, he trusts Sana and wants to protect her happiness.

===Anime===
An original video animation was produced in 1995 to mark the 40th anniversary of Ribon.

An anime adaption was later produced by Studio Gallop, consisting of 102 TV episodes, airing on the TXN network weekly from April 5, 1996 to March 27, 1998. The opening theme songs are &quot;7 O&#x27;Clock News&quot; by Tokio (episodes 1-44) and &quot;Ultra Relax&quot; by Tomoe Shinohara (episodes 45-102); the ending theme songs are &quot;Panic&quot; by Still Small Voice (episodes 1-39), &quot;DAIJO-BU&quot; by Tomoko Hikita (episodes 40-74), and &quot;Pinch (Love Me Deeper)&quot; by Rina Chinen (episodes 75-102).

Additionally, like Thompson, he found the art quality despite the time its age. Dillon Font from the same site called it &quot;very solid part of a manga collection.&quot; The reviewer compared it with the anime adaptation &quot;sorely missing the insane quirkiness that Daichi&#x27;s [the anime&#x27;s director] direction injected into the anime series&quot; which might leave the manga &quot;dull.&quot; Allen Divers from Anime News Network recommended it to readers commenting it is &quot;a solid story about a young girl coming of age that remains entertaining the entire way&quot;

The anime adaptation also received the praise with THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Carlos Ross who claimed &quot;the frenzied comedy is the selling point of this anime, and sell it does.&quot; Zac Bertschy from Anime News Network praised the characters as likables and also liked the animation and music. Reviewing the series&#x27; 10th DVD, Carl Kimlinger from the same website as Bertschy said that while &quot;neither the show nor Sana has slowed a whit in forty episodes&quot; the material not as appealing as previous episodes.

<text>Sight and Sound (formerly written Sight &amp; Sound) is a monthly film magazine published by the British Film Institute (BFI). Since 1952, it has conducted the well-known decennial &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time.

==History and content==

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot; was first published in Spring 1932 as &quot;A quarterly review of modern aids to learning published under the auspices of the British Institute of Adult Education&quot;. In 1934, management of the magazine was handed to the nascent British Film Institute (BFI), which still publishes the magazine today. &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; was published quarterly for most of its history until the early 1990s, apart from a brief run as a monthly publication in the early 1950s, but in 1991 it merged with another BFI publication, the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, and started to appear monthly.

In 1949, Gavin Lambert, co-founder of film journal &quot;Sequence&quot;, was hired as the editor, and also brought with him &quot;Sequence&quot; editor Penelope Houston as assistant editor as well as co-founders and future film directors Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz. Lambert edited the journal until 1956, with Houston taking over as editor until 1990. Philip Dodd became the editor following the merging of &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; with Nick James taking over in 1997. James was editor until August 2019. It is currently edited by Mike Williams. The magazine reviews all film releases each month, including those with a limited (art house) release, as opposed to most film magazines which concentrate on those films with a general release.

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot; has in the past been the subject of criticism, notably from Raymond Durgnat, who often accused it of elitism, puritanism and snobbery, although he did write for it in the 1950s, and again in the 1990s. Until 2020, the magazine&#x27;s American counterpart was &quot;Film Comment&quot;, a magazine that was published by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City.

==The &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time==
Since 1952, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; has conducted a decennial poll to determine the greatest films of all time. Until 1992, the votes of the invited critics and directors were compiled in one list; since 1992, directors have been invited to participate in a separate poll.

The &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll has come to be regarded as the most important of the &quot;greatest ever film&quot; lists. The critic Roger Ebert described it as &quot;by far the most respected of the countless polls of great movies—the only one most serious movie people take seriously.&quot;

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot; first ran the poll in 1952 following publication earlier in the year of a list of the Top Ten Films, headed by &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, based on a poll of mostly directors conducted by the committee of the Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. Following publication of that poll, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; decided to poll film critics for their choices and announced the results in their next issue. 85 critics from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were asked but only 63 responded including Lindsay Anderson, Lotte H. Eisner, Curtis Harrington, Henri Langlois, Friedrich Luft, Claude Mauriac, Dilys Powell, Jean Queval, Terry Ramsaye, Karel Reisz, G. W. Stonier (under the name William Whitebait) and Archer Winsten. Most critics found the question unfair. The first poll was topped by &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; with 25 out of 63 votes and contained six silent films. The five subsequent polls (1962–2002) were won by &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (which finished 13th in 1952).

For the 2012 poll, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; listened to decades of criticism about the lack of diversity of its poll participants and made a huge effort to invite a much wider variety of critics and filmmakers from around the world to participate, taking into account gender, ethnicity, race, geographical region, socioeconomic status, and other kinds of underrepresentation. The list of people polled for the critics&#x27; poll expanded significantly from 145 to 846 and also included programmers, curators, archivists, film historians and other academics for the first time. Following the change, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; only received the second highest number of votes, with &quot;Vertigo&quot; receiving the most. The directors&#x27; poll also expanded from 108 to 358 directors and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; received the most votes with &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; receiving the joint second-most together with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

In 2022, the number of people polled for the critics&#x27; poll increased even further from 846 to 1,639 and &quot;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&quot; received the most votes, the first film to be directed by a woman to top the list. &quot;Vertigo&quot; received the second most and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; third. Nearly 4,000 different films received at least one mention. &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; topped the directors&#x27; poll for the first time in 2022 with &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in second place and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; in joint fourth together with &quot;Jeanne Dielman&quot;. Among the directors that participated were Julie Dash, Barry Jenkins, Lynne Ramsay, Martin Scorsese and Apichatpong Weerasethakul.

&quot;La Règle du Jeu (The Rules of the Game)&quot; appeared in the first seven of the magazine&#x27;s decennial polls; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; has appeared in the last seven.

===Critics&#x27; Top Ten Poll===

====1952====

Closest runners-up: &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. (9 mentions apiece)

====1962====
Closest runners-up: &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot;, and &quot;Zero for Conduct&quot;. (11 mentions apiece)

The number of silent films on the list dropped from six to two. Films directed by Sergei Eisenstein received the most votes with 46, followed by Charles Chaplin with 43 and Jean Renoir with 35.

====1972====

== Greatest film books ==
In 2010, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; conducted a poll to find the greatest book written on film.

*First place: David Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot; (1975)&quot;
*Second place: Robert Bresson&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the Cinematographer&quot; (1975), Andrew Sarris&#x27;s &quot;The American Cinema&quot; (1968), and François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot; (1966) 
*Fifth place: André Bazin&#x27;s &quot;What is Cinema?&quot; (1958–1962)

<doc id="938519" wikidata="Q381904" url="?curid=938519" title="Pang Tong">
<text>Pang Tong () (179–214), courtesy name Shiyuan, was a Chinese politician who served as a key adviser to the warlord Liu Bei in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. In his youth, Pang Tong was disregarded because he was plain-looking. The hermit scholar Sima Hui, however, held him in high esteem and called him the &quot;Crown of Scholars in Jing Province&quot;. Pang Tong studied under Sima Hui along with Zhuge Liang, Xu Shu and Xiang Lang, and he was given the nickname &quot;Fledgling Phoenix&quot;. Owing to his friendly attitude, he worked as an appraiser in Nan Commandery. When he reviewed someone, he would prioritise their virtues over their abilities and encourage them to help others.

Pang Tong briefly served under Zhou Yu and befriended Lu Ji, Gu Shao and Quan Cong before joining Liu Bei after Liu Bei became the governor of Jing Province in 210. Through the recommendation of Lu Su and Zhuge Liang, Pang Tong was appointed by Liu Bei as an Assistant Officer and subsequently promoted to Military Adviser General of the Household. Pang Tong advised Liu Bei to take over Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) and accompanied him on his campaign against the warlord Liu Zhang, but was killed by a stray arrow during a battle at Luo County (north of present-day Guanghan, Sichuan) in 214.

==Early life==
Pang Tong was from Xiangyang Commandery, Jing Province. In his youth, he looked plain and simple, so aside from his uncle, Pang Degong (龐德公) who valued him. He was not highly regarded by others. When he reached adulthood (around 19 years old), he visited the hermit scholar Sima Hui, who was famous for spotting and recommending men of talent. They came to a mulberry tree, where Sima Hui climbed up to get the fruit while Pang Tong sat below, and they chatted for a whole day until nightfall. Sima Hui felt that Pang Tong was an extraordinary person and called Pang the &quot;Crown of Scholars in Jing Province&quot; (南州士之冠冕). Furthermore, he remarked, &quot;Pang Degong really knows how to judge people. This is truly a boy of majestic moral character.&quot; Subsequently, Pang Tong started gaining more recognition among the scholar-gentry. Like Zhuge Liang and Sima Hui who were respectively nicknamed “Crouching Dragon” and “Water Mirror” by the scholar-gentry, Pang Tong was nicknamed &quot;Fledgling Phoenix&quot; (鳳雛; also translated as &quot;Young Phoenix&quot;) by his uncle Pang Degong (龐德公).

==Service as appraiser==
Pang Tong later served as an Officer of Merit (功曹) in Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jiangling County, Hubei). By nature, Pang Tong was sociable with people and diligent in fostering and mentoring others. Hence, he was nominated to be an appraiser. When he reviewed people, he focused more on their personal virtues rather than their abilities. He was fond of ethical lessons and consistently strove to maintain high moral standards. He usually overpraised when he was asked to assess a person.

At times, people were puzzled so they questioned him on why he did that, to which he replied:

==Service under Zhou Yu==
In 209, Zhou Yu, a general under the warlord Sun Quan, occupied Nan Commandery after the Battle of Jiangling. After Zhou Yu was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Nan Commandery, Pang Tong served as an Officer of Merit (功曹) under him. When Zhou Yu died in 210, Pang Tong escorted his coffin back to Jiangdong and attended his funeral. Many of the officials in Jiangdong heard of his reputation. When he returned to Jing province, they all accompanied him as he left the city. Among them, Pang Tong met and befriended Lu Ji, Gu Shao and Quan Cong. He also appraised each of them separately and described Lu Ji as &quot;a horse that cannot run fast but has strong willpower&quot;, and Gu Shao as &quot;an ox that is physically weak but capable of bearing burdens over great distances&quot;. He also compared Quan Cong to Fan Zizhao (樊子昭) of Runan describing him as someone generous who admire respectable men.

Someone then asked Pang Tong: &quot;Does that mean Lu Ji is better than Gu Shao?&quot; Pang Tong replied: &quot;Although a horse can run fast, it can only bear the weight of one person. An ox can travel 300 &quot;li&quot; a day; it can certainly bear more than just the weight of one person!&quot; Gu Shao later asked Pang Tong: &quot;You are also known for being a good judge of character. Between us, who do you think is the better one?&quot; Pang Tong replied: &quot;I am not as good as you in associating with people and assessing their characters. However, when it comes to politics and strategy, it seems that I am one day ahead of you.&quot; Gu Shao agreed with Pang Tong and developed a closer bond with him. Before Pang Tong left, Lu Ji and Gu Shao told him: &quot;When peace is restored in the Empire, we want to have a good discussion with you about famous people.&quot; Both of them became close friends with Pang Tong.

==Serving Liu Bei in Jing Province==
Pang Tong became a subject of Liu Bei after the latter became the Governor of Jingzhou in 210. He initially served as an Assistant Officer (從事) and as the county magistrate (縣令) of Leiyang, but was later dismissed from office due to poor performance. Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Su wrote to Liu Bei, recommending Pang Tong as a great talent that should be employed to important tasks and not managing a small territory. Liu Bei&#x27;s strategist Zhuge Liang also recommended Pang Tong, so Liu Bei met with him, was greatly impressed and entrusted him with important matters. He recruited Pang to be an Assistant Officer in the Headquarters Office (治中從事). Liu Bei&#x27;s treatment towards Pang Tong was second to that of Zhuge Liang. He later appointed both Pang Tong and Zhuge Liang as Military Adviser Generals of the Household (軍師中郎將).

While making merry during a feast, Liu Bei asked Pang Tong: &quot;You once worked as Zhou Gongjin’s Officer of Merit. Before when I went to Wu, I heard that he secretly pressed Zhongmou to detain me. Is it true? When a man is with his lord, he must be utterly honest with him.&quot; Pang Tong admitted that it was true. Liu Bei then sighed and said: &quot;At this moment, I was in danger and they rescued me hence I could not refuse their invitation and almost failed to escape Zhou Yu&#x27;s grasp! In this world, men of talent and wisdom can see through each other&#x27;s plan. Before I left, Kongming protested against this with all his will. He has seen through this. However I didn&#x27;t listen because I was thinking that I was Zhongmou&#x27;s defense against the north and that he would need my help. I had no doubts about him. This was truly entering into the tiger&#x27;s den and a very risky plan.&quot;

==Assisting Liu Bei in the conquest of Yi Province==
Around 210s, Pang Tong convinced Liu Bei to seize Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) and use its resources to compete with his rival Cao Cao for supremacy over China. Pang Tong said : Liu Bei answered : Pang Tong replied : Liu Bei heeded Pang Tong&#x27;s suggestion.

In 211, Liu Bei led an army from Jing Province into Yi Province on the pretext of helping Yi Province&#x27;s governor, Liu Zhang, counter an invasion from the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhuge Liang remained behind to guard Jing Province while Pang Tong followed Liu Bei to Yi Province. Liu Zhang received Liu Bei at Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). Pang Tong urged Liu Bei to use the opportunity to capture Liu Zhang and force him to hand over Yi Province, but Liu Bei refused because he was new to Yi Province and had not established a strong foundation there yet. Liu Zhang later returned to Yi Province&#x27;s capital, Chengdu.

===Advising Liu Bei against Liu Zhang===
Pang Tong outlined three plans for Liu Bei to choose from:
*The upper plan: Select the best soldiers to form an elite force and advance quickly towards Chengdu, and force Liu Zhang to surrender and hand over Yi Province. Pang Tong also believed that Liu Zhang was not competent in military affairs and was unprepared, so the chances of success were high. Pang Tong considered this to be the best plan.
*The middle plan: Yang Huai (楊懷) and Gao Pei (高沛) were famous generals who led strong troops defending Baishui Pass (白水關), and that in the past they had advised Liu Zhang to send Liu Bei back to Jing Province. Before advancing, spread false news that Liu Bei was returning to Jing Province by claiming that the region was in danger and needed rescue. With Liu Bei&#x27;s reputation and wanting to see him leave, Yang and Gao would certainly come see him off with light cavalry, away from the fortified mountain passes they were defending. Then seize the opportunity to kill them and take control of their positions and troops, and finally advance towards Chengdu.
*The lower plan: Retreat to Baidicheng and wait for another opportunity to attack. Pang Tong considered this to be the worst plan.

Pang Tong told Liu Bei that if he took too much time and didn&#x27;t go then he would be in great danger and couldn&#x27;t last. Liu Bei chose the middle plan and executed it – he killed Yang Huai and Gao Pei, led his forces towards Chengdu and conquered several of Liu Zhang&#x27;s territories along the way.

===Disagreement over Liu Bei&#x27;s behavior during the campaign===
When Liu Bei expressed joy during a banquet in Fu County to celebrate his success saying that today should be a merry day, Pang Tong chided him, saying that &quot;celebrating the invasion of others&#x27; territory isn&#x27;t what a man of &quot;ren&quot; (benevolence) should do&quot;. The drunk Liu Bei retorted angrily, &quot;King Wu of Zhou also rejoiced after his victory over King Zhou of Shang. Is he not an example of a man of &quot;ren&quot;? You&#x27;re wrong, so get out now!&quot; After Pang Tong left, Liu Bei regretted what he said so he invited Pang back. Pang Tong returned to his seat and did not say anything, acting as usual, so Liu Bei asked, &quot;When that quarrel happened just now, whose fault do you think it was?&quot; Pang Tong replied, &quot;It was both yours and mine.&quot; Liu Bei laughed and the banquet continued.

Xi Zuochi commented on this event and said :

Pei Songzhi added :

==Death==

Pang Tong later participated in a battle against Liu Zhang&#x27;s forces at Luo County (雒縣; north of present-day Guanghan, Sichuan). He died after being hit by a stray arrow in the midst of battle. He was 36 years old (by East Asian age reckoning) at the time of his death. Liu Bei was deeply saddened by Pang Tong&#x27;s death and he would weep whenever Pang Tong was mentioned. Pang Tong was posthumously made a Second Class Marquess (關內侯) after Liu Bei became emperor and established the state of Shu Han in 221. In October or November 260, Liu Bei&#x27;s son and successor, Liu Shan, honoured Pang Tong with the posthumous title &quot;Marquess Jingxi&quot; (靖西侯).

Liu Bei had a shrine and tomb constructed for Pang Tong near Luo County. The shrine and tomb is located in present-day Baimaguan Town (白馬關鎮), Luojiang County, Sichuan. On 25 May 2006, it became a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level.

===Tang Geng about Pang Tong&#x27;s death===
Tang Geng (唐庚), a scholar from the Song dynasty, in his work called the &quot;Three Kingdoms Miscellaneous Cases&quot; (三國雜事), lamented over the young age at which Pang Tong died, recalling that while Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong were classmates, by the time Zhuge Liang died at a relatively young age of 53, Pang Tong himself was already dead since 20 years. He then commented on the fact that the year 219 when Liu Bei took the title of &quot;King of Hanzhong&quot; was also the year Guan Yu died. Next year, in 220 Huang Zhong and Fa Zheng died. Next year, in 221 Zhang Fei died. Next year, in 222 Ma Chao and Ma Liang died.

Before the foundation has been complete, each of those heroes were lost one following the other as if they were being stolen away. Next year, in 223 when Liu Shan took the imperial throne. Among the veterans, only Zhuge Liang and Zhao Yun were left. Seven years later and Zhao Yun was dead in 229 while Zhuge Liang died five years later in 234. At this time, all of those who achieved past glory were gone. Fa Zheng barely reached 44 years old, Ma Chao 46 years old and Ma Liang 34 years old. Zhang Fei was said to be younger than both Liu Bei and Guan Yu; since Guan Yu was several years older than him, he must have been around fifty or so when he died. Huo Jun died when he was just 39 years old.

All of these outstanding individuals are born with great talents yet live a short life; all while Qiao Zhou lived to be more than seventy years old. With this, it should be clear to anyone that Heaven no longer favour the Han.

After Pang Tong&#x27;s death, Liu Bei appointed Pang&#x27;s father – whose name was not recorded in history – as a Consultant (議郎) and later promoted him to a Counsellor Remonstrant (諫議大夫). Zhuge Liang treated him with great respect.

Pang Tong had a younger brother, Pang Lin (龐林). His wife was the sister of Xi Zhen, In 208, they were separated when Cao Cao invaded Jing Province and occupied Xiangyang. And reunited after the Battle of Xiaoting. During more than a decade of separation, she remained faithful to her husband and raised their daughter on her own. The Wei emperor Cao Pi praised her for her virtues and awarded her gifts. He served as an Assistant Officer in Jing Province&#x27;s Headquarters Office (荊州治中從事). He participated in the Battle of Xiaoting in 221–222 alongside the general Huang Quan and was in charge of defending the northern flank from possible attacks by Shu&#x27;s rival state, Wei. After Liu Bei lost to Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting, Pang Lin and Huang Quan were separated from Liu Bei&#x27;s remaining forces and could not return to Shu, so they brought along their troops and surrendered to Wei. Pang Lin served as the Administrator (太守) of Julu Commandery (鉅鹿郡) in Wei and received a marquis title. Fei Guan

Pang Tong had a son, Pang Hong (龐宏), whose courtesy name was Jushi (巨師). Pang Hong, who served in the Shu government, was known for being frugal, upright and outspoken. He offended Chen Di (陳袛), the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令). Chen Di found fault with Pang Hong and blocked him from getting promoted. He died in office while serving as the Administrator (太守) of Fuling Commandery (涪陵郡).

The previously mentioned Pang Degong, was also from Xiangyang. He was an acquaintance of Zhuge Liang, who showed him great respect by always bowing deeply before him when he visited his house. One day, when Pang Degong was away to pay his respects at his ancestor&#x27;s tomb across the Mian River, Sima Hui visited his house and instructed his family to prepare a meal, telling them that &quot;Xu Shu said that an important guest is coming to meet him and Pang Degong.&quot; Pang Degong&#x27;s family respectfully followed Sima Hui&#x27;s instructions. When Pang Degong returned, he did not seem surprised by Sima Hui&#x27;s visit and behaved normally; it was as though he saw Sima Hui as a regular member of his household. Sima Hui, being ten years younger than Pang Degong, treated the latter as an older brother and called him affectionately &quot;Lord Pang&quot; (龐公) – to the point where people thought that &quot;Lord Pang&quot; was Pang Degong&#x27;s courtesy name.

Pang Degong&#x27;s son, Pang Shanmin (龐山民) also enjoyed a good reputation and married one of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s sisters. He later served a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate (黃門吏) but died at a young age. His son, Pang Huan (龐渙), whose courtesy name was Shiwen (世文), served as the Administrator of Zangke Commandery (牂牁太守) during the Jin dynasty between 280 and 289. 

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Pang Tong&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, appraised Pang as follows: &quot;Pang Tong was good when associating with others. He diligently studied the classics, from this pondered his planning. During his time, people from Jing and Chu thought he was an exceptional talent. In comparison with officials from (Cao) Wei, Pang Tong would be similar to Xun Yu like a brother while Fa Zheng would be of the same nefarious kind as Cheng and Guo.

Yang Xi, who wrote the &quot;Ji Han Fuchen Zan&quot; (季漢輔臣贊; pub. 241), a collection of praises of notable persons who served in the Shu Han state, appraised him as follows: &quot;Military Adviser General of the Household (軍師中郎將; Pang Tong) showed brightly, both extreme elegance and virtue. He devoted his life to clear his Master&#x27;s path, loyal to his feelings and always delivered his opinion. But for all those righteousness actions, in response to virtue he received death.&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Pang Tong appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Pang Tong is portrayed as a brilliant military strategist who equals Zhuge Liang. Sima Hui recommends Pang Tong and Zhuge Liang as talents to aid Liu Bei by saying, &quot;Hidden Dragon and Young Phoenix. If you can get either of them, you&#x27;ll be able to pacify the empire.&quot;

In Chapter 47, before the Battle of Red Cliffs, Jiang Gan recommends Pang Tong to Cao Cao. Pang Tong presents a &quot;chain links strategy&quot; (連環計) to Cao. The plan involves linking Cao Cao&#x27;s battleships together with strong iron chains to make the ships more stable when they were sailing, as well as to reduce the chances of Cao&#x27;s soldiers falling seasick due to excessive rocking. This leads to Cao Cao&#x27;s defeat as his battleships are unable to separate from each other during the fire attack, and when one ship is set aflame, the other ships linked to it catch fire as well.

Pang Tong&#x27;s death during the war between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang is highly dramatised in Chapter 63. At the outset of the battle at Luo County, before Liu Bei and Pang Tong split forces for a two-pronged attack, Pang Tong&#x27;s horse rears and throws him off its back. This is seen as a bad omen. Liu Bei then let Pang Tong borrow his famous steed, Dilu (的盧). However, Dilu is believed to bring bad luck to its rider despite having saved Liu Bei&#x27;s life earlier. Liu Zhang&#x27;s general Zhang Ren, who plans an ambush near Luo County, recognises Dilu and mistakes its rider to be Liu Bei, so he orders his archers to fire at the rider. Pang Tong is hit by several arrows which pierce through his body and he dies on the spot. His place of death is called &quot;Valley of the Fallen Phoenix&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Pang Tong is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; and &quot;Dynasty Tactics&quot; video game series.

Pang Tong is the sixth of the eight genius students of Master Water Mirror in &quot;The Ravages of Time&quot; manhua.

<text>Laura Ann Branigan (July 3, 1952 – August 26, 2004) was an American singer. Her signature song, the platinum-certified 1982 single &quot;Gloria&quot;, stayed on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 36 weeks, then a record for a female artist, peaking at No. 2. It also reached number one in Australia and Canada. Branigan&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot; was a cover of a song written by Italian singer-songwriters Giancarlo Bigazzi and Umberto Tozzi. In 1984, she reached number one in Canada and Germany and No. 4 in the U.S. with &quot;Self Control&quot; a cover of Italian singer and songwriter Raf from the same year. Both &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Self Control&quot; were successful in the United Kingdom, making the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart.

Seeing her greatest level of success in the 1980s, Branigan&#x27;s other singles included the Top 10 hit &quot;Solitaire&quot; (1983), the U.S. Adult Contemporary Chart number one &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot; (1983), the Australian No. 2 hit &quot;Ti amo&quot; (1984) a cover of 1977 single by Umberto Tozzi, her return to the top 40 &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (1987), and &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; (1987), which reached the top 15 of the U.S. dance chart. Her most successful studio album was 1984&#x27;s platinum-selling &quot;Self Control&quot;. She also contributed songs to motion picture and television soundtracks, including the Grammy- and Academy Award–winning &quot;Flashdance&quot; soundtrack (1983), the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; soundtrack (1984), and &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1984). In 1984, she won the Tokyo Music Festival with the song &quot;The Lucky One&quot;.

Her chart success began to wane as the decade closed and after her last two studio albums &quot;Laura Branigan&quot; (1990) and &quot;Over My Heart&quot; (1993) garnered little attention, she generally retired from public life for the rest of the 1990s. She returned to performing in the early 2000s, most notably appearing as Janis Joplin in the off-Broadway musical &quot;Love, Janis&quot;. As she was recording new music and preparing a comeback to the music industry, she died at her home in August 2004 from a previously undiagnosed cerebral aneurysm.

Branigan and her music saw renewed popularity and public interest in 2019 in the U.S. after &quot;Gloria&quot; was adopted by the NHL&#x27;s St. Louis Blues as their unofficial victory song while they completed a historic mid-season turnaround to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history, leading to the song entering ice hockey lore as an &quot;unlikely championship anthem&quot;. Branigan&#x27;s legacy manager and representative Kathy Golik embraced the trend and traveled to St. Louis to publicly represent Branigan among the Blues fanbase during the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs, later stating her belief that Branigan and &quot;Gloria&quot; &quot;will forever be intertwined&quot; with the Blues and the city of St. Louis.

Branigan&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Self Control&quot; regained popularity as part of the soundtrack of the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, and subsequently became Branigan&#x27;s most streamed song on Spotify and YouTube.

==Biography==
===1952–1970: Early life===
Laura Ann Branigan was born on July 3, 1952, in Mount Kisco, New York, near New York City, the fourth of five children born to Irish-American parents Kathleen ( O&#x27;Hare) and James Branigan Sr., an account executive and mutual funds broker; they later separated. Her younger brother William &quot;Billy&quot; Branigan, who was also a musician, played guitar in Branigan&#x27;s backing band early in her career and later contributed to her 1993 album &quot;Over My Heart&quot; as a co-producer, arranger, guitarist, bassist and backing vocalist, in addition to co-writing the track &quot;Over You&quot; with his sister. He died of a heart attack on March 10, 2022, aged 65.

Branigan was raised in Armonk, New York, and as a child attended a Catholic school in nearby Chappaqua. She attended Byram Hills High School, graduating in 1970.

Between 1970 and 1972, Branigan attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.

===1972–1980: Career beginnings===
In 1972, Branigan met acoustic guitarist Walker Daniels and his future wife Sharon Storm, and acoustic guitarist Chris Van Cleave, forming the folk-rock band Meadow. In 1973 the group, with bass player Bob Valdez, released their debut album &quot;The Friend Ship&quot;, featuring the singles &quot;When You Were Young&quot;, and &quot;Cane and Able&quot;, which featured the hook line &quot;Throw away your cane and you are able&quot;. The record was not properly promoted and never re-released. The band broke up, after which Walker Daniels committed suicide. Branigan preferred not to discuss her involvement with Meadow publicly.

During the years after Meadow broke up, Branigan had various jobs, including a stint as one of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s backup singers for his European tour in April–August 1976.

Branigan met attorney Larry Ross Kruteck (1936–1996) on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day March 17, 1978, at a party in Manhattan and got married after almost nine months of dating December 8, 1978.

In 1979, after a chance meeting with manager Sid Bernstein on her return from Europe, Branigan was signed by Ahmet Ertegun to Atlantic Records. For several years Atlantic had difficulty classifying Branigan&#x27;s powerful voice. Her pop single &quot;Looking Out for Number One&quot;, from her unreleased album &quot;Silver Dreams&quot;, made a brief appearance on the U.S. dance chart, reaching No. 60. Two other early Atlantic singles, &quot;Tell Him&quot; and &quot;Fool&#x27;s Affair&quot;/&quot;When&quot;, followed. None of these three singles were included on her first album, but all four songs were eventually released on CD over 30 years later in 2014 as bonus cuts on a U.S. CD reissue of Branigan&#x27;s first album.
Branigan&#x27;s nine-track debut album, &quot;Branigan&quot;, was released in March 1982. The first single from the album was &quot;All Night with Me&quot;, which reached No. 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in early 1982. The album alternated four energetic up-tempo songs with five ballads, including one of the few songs written solely by Branigan, &quot;I Wish We Could Be Alone&quot;. &quot;Gloria&quot;, an Italian love song recorded in 1979 by Umberto Tozzi and successful in several European countries, was released as the album&#x27;s second single. Branigan&#x27;s version was reworked with Tozzi&#x27;s own arranger, Greg Mathieson, who updated its production with fellow producer Jack White to give it what Branigan called &quot;an American kick&quot; to match the new English lyrics. U.S. radio stations were initially unreceptive to &quot;Gloria&quot;, but after it was embraced by dance clubs it eventually won them over, becoming one of the biggest hits of the 1980s. The album went gold, and the single was eventually certified platinum (sales of more than two million U.S. copies). Branigan&#x27;s performance of &quot;Gloria&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance alongside Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John, Juice Newton and that year&#x27;s winner, Melissa Manchester, becoming her only solo nomination.

In the spring of 1983, Branigan released her second album: &quot;Branigan 2&quot;. Her vocals propelled her English-language version of the French song &quot;Solitaire&quot; toward the top of the U.S. charts. The original &quot;Solitaire&quot; was written and recorded in 1981 by French singer-songwriter Martine Clemenceau. Two songs included on the album began the careers for two then-unknowns: the English translation of &quot;Solitaire&quot; was the first major hit for songwriter Diane Warren, while the ballad &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot; was the first major hit for its co-writer, Michael Bolton. Branigan&#x27;s version reached No. 12 on the hot 100 and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart.

=== 1981–1989: Mainstream success ===
During the height of her career, Branigan also made acting appearances, first in 1981 in &quot;An American Girl in Berlin&quot; for West German television, and then after the success of &quot;Gloria&quot;, guest appearances on American television series such as &quot;CHiPs&quot; (&quot;Fox Trap&quot;, season 6, episode 16, in which she played Sarah, lead singer of the female rock band Cadillac Foxes), &quot;Automan&quot; (&quot;Murder MTV&quot;, season 1, episode 9) and &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. She would later appear in independent films including &quot;Mugsy&#x27;s Girls&quot; (aka &quot;Delta Pi&quot;, 1985) with Oscar-winner Ruth Gordon, and the Australian film &quot;Backstage&quot;. She sang on major national television and radio campaigns for products including Dr Pepper, Coca-Cola and Chrysler, which sponsored her 1985–1986 &quot;Hold Me&quot; tour.

The year 1984, while she was working with German producer Jack White, was the height of the European synthpop era, and &quot;Self Control&quot;, the title track of Branigan&#x27;s third album, released in April 1984 became her biggest hit internationally, topping the charts in over six countries, most notably West Germany, where it spent six weeks at No. 1. The original version was recorded a few months earlier, still in 1984, under the name of one of the song&#x27;s co-writers &quot;Raf&quot; (Raffaele Riefoli), and held the West German number 2 spot during this time period; Branigan&#x27;s version enjoyed more success outside of Raf&#x27;s native Italy, hitting No. 4 in the U.S. The song was featured on the eighth episode of the first season of the TV series, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, entitled &quot;The Great McCarthy&quot;, which aired on November 16, 1984. Other pop, disco, and adult contemporary hits from the &quot;Self Control&quot; album include &quot;The Lucky One&quot; (which won her a Tokyo Music Festival prize), the continental ballad &quot;Ti Amo&quot; (another Umberto Tozzi hit, and a No. 2 hit in Australia for Branigan) and the dance hit &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. The album also featured an understated version of Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&quot;; as a counterpoint to all the dance productions, it was a bare-bones piano version. (In concerts and television appearances throughout her career, Branigan accompanied herself on the piano for the song.)

Also during 1984, Branigan contributed the song &quot;Hot Night&quot; to the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; soundtrack. The song was written by Diane Warren and The Doctor.

Branigan&#x27;s vocal coach was Carlo Menotti, and she worked with Steve Lukather (Toto), Dann Huff (Giant) and Michael Landau; keyboardists Greg Mathieson, Harold Faltermeyer, Michael Boddicker and Robbie Buchanan; bassists Nathan East and Dennis Belfield (Rufus); drummers Carlos Vega and Doane Perry (Jethro Tull); percussionists Paulinho Da Costa and Lenny Castro; and guest vocalists including Joe &quot;Bean&quot; Esposito and background vocalists including The Waters Sisters (Maxine and Julia), James Ingram, and Richard Page and Stephen George (Mr. Mister). As her stature grew, she attracted Grammy-winning producers including Phil Ramone, Richard Perry and David Kershenbaum. She performed duets with John Farnham as well as Latin pop artist Luis Miguel.

In 1984, Branigan&#x27;s live show was recorded twice, for a syndicated radio concert series and a concert video. Branigan was also nominated for an award at the American Music Awards of 1985 for favorite pop/rock female video artist, won by Cyndi Lauper. Also in 1985, Branigan performed the main theme song for the television mini-series &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot;, based on the novel by Jackie Collins.

By the time Branigan&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Hold Me&quot; was released in July 1985, &quot;Self Control&quot; was a worldwide success. The hits continued with &quot;Spanish Eddie&quot;, which was her sixth U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40 pop hit in two and a half years. The subsequent single release &quot;Hold Me&quot; was a U.S. top-40 dance hit, and Branigan&#x27;s introduction of the rock ballad &quot;I Found Someone&quot; (co-written by Michael Bolton, a later hit for Cher) scored even higher on the adult contemporary chart. However, neither song was supported by a music video, and both stalled at the low end of the Hot 100 chart. On June 13, 1985, Branigan made her fourth appearance on legendary TV music show &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, performing &quot;Spanish Eddie&quot; and &quot;Hold Me&quot;.
In February 1986, Branigan was invited for the first time to XXVII Festival Internacional De La Canción De Viña Del Mar in Chile, having a successful performance on the main stage and by television and thus increasing its popularity both in Chile and in the rest of Latin America.

Branigan&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Touch&quot; (released July 7, 1987) marked a change in her career. Under new management and using different producers, Branigan took a more active role in her work and in the studio, seeing her return to dancefloors with the Stock-Aitken-Waterman-produced track &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, written by Bob Mitchell and Steve Coe, of the band Monsoon. &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; was performed by Branigan on the last episode of &quot;American Bandstand&quot; (hosted by Dick Clark) to be broadcast on ABC (the show would last for two more years, first in first-run syndication and finally on the USA Network) on September 5, 1987, becoming their last guest performer. The album also included a return to the Billboard top-40 with her cover of Jennifer Rush&#x27;s &quot;Power of Love&quot;, which was one of the 20 bestselling singles in the U.S. during the Christmas season. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;, a top-30 AC hit, did not capture the attention of pop radio stations and stalled; the ballad was recorded two years later by Stevie Nicks, and more recently by its writer Jude Johnstone.

===1990–2000: Later career and hiatus===
Branigan&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Laura Branigan&quot; (1990), brought her back to the Hi-NRG charts and gay clubs with &quot;Moonlight on Water&quot;, and she scored a top-30 adult contemporary hit with &quot;Never in a Million Years&quot;. Branigan added production to her list of credits with her cover of Vicki Sue Robinson&#x27;s disco-era &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot; and the atmospheric &quot;Let Me In&quot;, a cover of an Eddie Money song. The album also includes &#x27;&quot;Unison&quot;, which was the title track for Céline Dion&#x27;s English debut CD in the same year. The album&#x27;s closing track, a cover of Bryan Adams&#x27; &quot;The Best Was Yet to Come&quot;, was produced and arranged by Branigan. The 1990–1991 Laura Branigan Tour, which was kicked off with an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on July 13, 1990 was followed by a performance in the Trump Regency Showroom in Atlantic City, New Jersey on July 14, and filmed for a syndicated U.S. television show &quot;SRO in Concert&quot;, which was released on videocassette and laserdisc; on July 15, 1990, she performed at the Warwick Musical Theatre in Rhode Island.
On Branigan&#x27;s seventh and final studio album &quot;Over My Heart&quot; (August 17, 1993), the singer again produced (with Phil Ramone), and wrote and arranged. It included &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Win It All&quot; (by Branigan and Brian BecVar) (released as the first single), a cover of Cher&#x27;s song &quot;Hard Enough Getting Over You&quot; (released as the second single), a cover of the Patty Loveless single &quot;How Can I Help You Say Goodbye&quot;, a cover of Roxette&#x27;s song &quot;The Sweet Hello, The Sad Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Is There Anybody Here But Me?&quot; (Pessis, Wells), a smooth mid-tempo number.

Branigan recorded a duet with David Hasselhoff which was hugely successful for being broadcast as the closing track of the &quot;Baywatch&quot; TV series. The single &quot;I Believe&quot; was originally released on CD album in 1994.

After 1990, Branigan&#x27;s chart success cooled in the U.S., though she was still in demand around the world and went on several global tours. In 1994, not long after the release of &quot;Over My Heart&quot;, Larry Kruteck, Branigan&#x27;s husband (m. 1978), was diagnosed with colon cancer. Branigan refused to accept the medical prognosis, and left the music industry to devote her attention to him. Branigan put Kruteck on herbal treatments, eventually nursing him full-time. Kruteck survived for another two-and-a-half years and died on June 15, 1996, after which Branigan stopped performing.

Branigan had official greatest hits collections released in South America, Japan, Germany, South Africa, and the U.S.; the U.S. collection was released in 1995. The 13-track &quot;The Best of Branigan&quot; included two newly recorded covers: &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot; (written by Maria McKee) and the Donna Summer hit &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot;, which Branigan released in several remixes. On August 15, 1995, Branigan was a guest on the TV show &quot;Talking Food&quot;, hosted by Robin Leach and broadcast by the Food Network, and she promoted the album and sang &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot;, before preparing her Summer Delight pasta dish on the show.

In February 1996, she was selected to be part of the international jury at the 37th Viña del Mar International Song Festival edition, in Chile. Besides her duties as a jury member of this international musical competition, Branigan performed on February 16 on the main stage for an audience who enthusiastically sang her greatest hits.

===2001–2004: Return to music===
In early 2001, Branigan&#x27;s return to the stage was postponed, when she broke both of her femurs in a 10-foot fall from a ladder while she was hanging wisteria outside her three-bedroom lakeside home in Westchester County, New York, resulting in physical therapy for six months. In 2002, she performed twice as the &quot;singing&quot; Janis Joplin in the off-Broadway musical &quot;Love, Janis&quot;, before dropping out of the show. &quot;I left &quot;Janis&quot; because the producers failed to file with Equity properly,&quot; she told the &quot;Sunday News&quot; in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. &quot;I was sort of relieved. My voice isn&#x27;t anything like Janis Joplin&#x27;s, and there were 19 of her songs in the show.&quot; In later years she continued to record, and dated Tommy Bayiokos, the drummer in her band. Also in 2002, her second official US hits collection, &quot;The Essentials&quot;, was released, including the long-out-of-print hit &quot;I Found Someone&quot;.

==Death==
Branigan died in her sleep at her lodge in East Quogue, New York, on August 26, 2004, aged 52. The cause was attributed to a previously undiagnosed cerebral aneurysm. It was reported that she had been experiencing persistent headaches for several weeks before her death, but had sought no medical attention for them. At the time of her death, it was widely and erroneously reported that she was 47 years old, resulting from a technical error the Associated Press published after contacting Branigan&#x27;s management company.

Branigan was cremated, and her ashes were scattered over Long Island Sound.

==Legacy==
At Byram Hills High School in Armonk, New York, the Laura Branigan Memorial Scholarship is given annually to a senior for excellence in the performing arts.

===&quot;Play Gloria&quot; association with St. Louis Blues===
The St. Louis Blues NHL team began using Branigan&#x27;s version of &quot;Gloria&quot; as its unofficial victory song when they went on a franchise-record 11-game winning streak during the 2018–19 season. A few Blues players visited a bar in South Philadelphia called Jacks NYB to watch the NFL Wild Card game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears.

At the time, the Blues had the worst record in the league at 15–18–4, had fired head coach Mike Yeo, called up rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington from the minor leagues to replace struggling starter Jake Allen, and seemed bound for a lost season. Following their January 7 victory over the Flyers, which was Binnington&#x27;s first NHL start, the Blues played &quot;Gloria&quot; in the locker room to celebrate their victory, with it then becoming a regular locker room ritual. When their arena DJ learned of it, he began playing the song in the arena to rally the team. From January 2019 the Blues would post a 30–10–5 record in the remaining games to finish at 45–28–9 and qualify for a playoff spot, eventually advancing to the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, the teams&#x27; first Stanley Cup Finals since 1970, where they defeated the Boston Bruins in 7 games to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. The dramatic turnaround in the Blues&#x27; fortunes following their adoption of &quot;Gloria&quot; led to it being embraced as their new victory anthem. The song is played at Enterprise Center every time the Blues win a game, leading to &quot;Play Gloria!&quot; becoming both a meme and victory chant for Blues fans. Local radio station Y98 played the song for 24 hours following the Blues&#x27; Game 7 double-overtime 2–1 victory over the Dallas Stars on May 8 and again two weeks later on May 22 after its Game 6 5–1 win over the San Jose Sharks to win the Western Conference Championship and advance to the finals. After the Blues defeated the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals, on June 12, Y98 played &quot;Gloria&quot; again for 24 hours. The bands Phish and Vampire Weekend, who were both holding concerts in St. Louis on the night of Game 7, performed covers of &quot;Gloria&quot; when they learned the Blues had won the Cup.

Branigan&#x27;s legacy manager and representative Kathy Golik has embraced the trend, with Branigan&#x27;s verified Twitter page frequently posting support for the Blues, especially during their 2019 playoff run. Branigan&#x27;s official website also got updated with a new splash page which expressed support for the Blues and proclaimed Branigan as the &quot;Original Play Gloria&quot;. Golik stayed in St. Louis and attended every game and watch party during the Blues&#x27; 2019 Stanley Cup run as Branigan&#x27;s representative among the Blues fanbase while discussing the trend with media outlets. When fans of the Boston Bruins, the Blues&#x27; opponent in the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, started re-purposing the &quot;Play Gloria&quot; meme it earned a rebuke from Branigan&#x27;s Twitter page which went viral. Custom-made Blues jerseys with Branigan&#x27;s name and the number 82 surged in popularity during the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, with one being displayed on Branigan&#x27;s Twitter page, along with other Blues merchandise sent by fans. &quot;Gloria&quot; reappeared on the iTunes singles chart thanks to the trend, going to number 3 after the Blues won the Stanley Cup. &quot;Gloria&quot; would also re-enter the Billboard charts in the wake of the Blues&#x27; championship, landing at No. 46 on the Billboard Digital Song Sales chart for the week of June 22, 2019. Golik noted that streams of &quot;Gloria&quot; have surged across all platforms and this has had a &quot;trickle down&quot; effect to the rest of Branigan&#x27;s catalog, with her other hit songs such as &quot;Self Control&quot;, &quot;Solitaire&quot; and &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot; seeing significant upticks in streams and downloads during the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The song&#x27;s resurgence in popularity has led to Branigan&#x27;s management getting numerous requests for live performances and public appearances, leading them to release a statement reminding the public that Branigan is deceased, as well as adding a note about this to her social media accounts. &quot;Forbes&quot; described &quot;Gloria&quot; as an &quot;unlikely championship anthem&quot; and noted that the Blues&#x27; Stanley Cup victory could permanently alter the meaning and legacy of the song, with it becoming forever associated with the St. Louis Blues and ice hockey in general. Golik has also stated her belief that Branigan and &quot;Gloria&quot; &quot;will forever be intertwined&quot; with the Blues and the city of St. Louis. When asked how she thought Branigan would have reacted to the &quot;Play Gloria&quot; meme had she lived to see it, Golik said, &quot;She was very sincere, very down to Earth, she would just have been very touched by it all. If she were here, I know she would have participated in a very big way. I know she&#x27;s there in spirit. To see them win and to hear that song blaring and coming up in the arena and looking around and seeing people singing out as loud as they can, cheering and having a good time, it&#x27;s indescribable what that&#x27;s like.&quot; In addition, Branigan&#x27;s boyfriend at the time of her passing Tommy Bayiokos, who also was in her band, said &quot;Laura would have gladly satisfied fans&#x27; desire to hear it live. She would have been humbled and performed with gusto. The &quot;Play Gloria&quot; wave started at the Jacks NYB bar and was totally unscripted ... it&#x27;s been bittersweet and a testament of Laura&#x27;s musical prowess.&quot;

<text>Lois Elsa Hole, CM, AOE DStJ (née Veregin; 30 January 1929 – 6 January 2005) was a Canadian politician, businesswoman, academician, professional gardener and best-selling author. She was the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Alberta from 10 February 2000 until her death on 6 January 2005. She was known as the &quot;Queen of Hugs&quot; for breaking with protocol and hugging almost everyone she met, including journalists, diplomats and other politicians.

==Early life and family==
Lois Elsa Veregin was born in Buchanan, Saskatchewan, to Michael M. Veregin and Elsa Viktoria Norsten in 1929, not 1933, as was later misreported. Her family moved to Edmonton, Alberta in 1948, where she completed her education at Old Scona Academic High School.

In 1950, she met Ted Hole, a young University of Alberta agriculture student. Several years later they married and moved to a farm near St. Albert, Alberta. Lois and Ted Hole ran a successful market garden business from their farm which they, along with their sons Bill and Jim, incorporated as Hole&#x27;s Greenhouses &amp; Gardens Ltd. in 1979. It remained one of Western Canada&#x27;s largest retail greenhouse stores until it closed in early 2011 when the Hole family moved the operation to their new site on the edge of Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park, and opened the Enjoy Centre.

===Personal education and involvement in education===
She received her secondary education at Strathcona High School (now known as Old Scona Academic High School) and then her ATCM (her associates diploma) in Music from the Royal Conservatory of Music, Toronto, Ontario.

In 1983, she was awarded an honorary doctorate Doctor of Athabasca University and in 1997 received a Distinguished Citizen Honorary Diploma in Business from Grant MacEwan College and in 2000 received an Honorary Doctorate in Laws from the University of Alberta. In 2003, she received an Honorary Degree in Horticulture from Olds College, Olds, Alberta.

She was a school trustee at St. Albert School District No. 6 in 1998, was a trustee and chairperson, Sturgeon School Division, was on the Athabasca University Governing Council, and Chancellor of University of Alberta, 1998–2000.

She was the Keynote speaker at the Alberta College Graduation Ceremony in 2000, at Strathcona Composite High School Commencement ceremony in 2001, and at the Strathcona Composite High School commencement ceremony in 2003.

===Writings===
In 1993, Hole wrote her first book, &quot;Vegetable Favourites&quot;, and went on to write five more in the &quot;Favourites&quot; series. There are currently more than 1,000,000 copies of the various books in this series in print. The series won the Educational Media Award from the Professional Plant Growers Association in 1996. In 1998, Hole&#x27;s Greenhouse began publishing their own books starting with Hole&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Marry a Farmer&quot;. She also wrote several books with her son, Jim. Hole&#x27;s Greenhouse has continued to publish gardening books along with a successful annual magazine, &quot;Lois&#x27; Spring Gardening&quot;.

==Lieutenant governor==
Hole was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien in December 1999, and assumed office on 10 February 2000. One of her first acts as Lieutenant Governor was to discuss with Premier Ralph Klein over his government&#x27;s controversial legislation which expanded the role of private providers in public health care, nonetheless she pledged to avoid a constitutional crisis and signed the bill into law.

===Ted and Lois Hole&#x27;s deaths===
During his wife&#x27;s term in office, Ted Hole died of cancer in April 2003. Lois Hole had been diagnosed with abdominal cancer in 2002, making a public announcement the following year when she began treatment in early 2003. Her health improved, temporarily, but by late 2004, her case was terminal. Her illness prevented her from making several scheduled public appearances. She died in office at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton on 6 January 2005, aged 75.

A public memorial was held for Hole at Edmonton&#x27;s Winspear Centre. Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson was criticized for failing to attend Hole&#x27;s memorial service. Rideau Hall issued a statement saying the Governor General was, at the time, abroad representing Canada at the inauguration of the President of Ukraine, Victor Yushchenko. However, the inauguration was postponed, and it was felt that Clarkson could have returned to Canada for the service. When it was later reported by the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that Clarkson would wait in Paris, France, for the rescheduled presidential investiture, more outrage was expressed in the press, which was only compounded when Rideau Hall informed the public that the Governor General would also attend a &quot;long-standing engagement&quot; with the Queen at Sandringham House, contradicting reports that Buckingham Palace had said the dinner was actually booked at the last minute. In response, some monarchists began lobbying Clarkson to resign, had she willingly used the Queen for publicity and damage control purposes.

Most sources cited 1933 as Lois Hole&#x27;s year of birth based on her reported age at death. However, the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, the Royal Alberta United Services Institute&#x27;s newsletter and the Legislature of Alberta all indicate that she was born in 1929. The Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta confirmed that Hole was born on 30 January 1929.

==Awards and legacy==
She was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1999 and a Dame of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in 2000. In 1995, she was named Edmonton Business and Professional Woman of the Year and St. Albert&#x27;s Citizen of the Year. In 2003 she was awarded the Gandhi, King, Ikeda Humanitarian Award. She was made an &quot;Honorary Patricia&quot; by the 1st Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry.

The Alberta Library Trustees Association (ALTA) established the Lois Hole Award in 2001. In November 2004, two months before Lois Hole&#x27;s death, the Capital Health Authority in Edmonton announced that a new wing of the Royal Alexandra Hospital would be named the Lois Hole Hospital for Women. It opened 13 April 2010 and consolidated the women&#x27;s health programs and services based at the Royal Alexandra Hospital into one building.

On 19 April 2005, the Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park was established, becoming the 69th provincial park in Alberta. The park contains the former Big Lake Natural Area and an additional 302 hectares of Crown land, for a total of 1421 hectares. The lake comprises approximately 59 percent of the park&#x27;s total area.

In 2008 the Edmonton Public Library opened the Lois Hole Library in Callingwood North. It features a sculpture of Lois Hole by Danek Mozdzenski and a reading garden. In 2009, the City of St. Albert declared 14 May to be Lois Hole Day. A bronze statue designed by Barbara Paterson called &quot;A Legacy of Love and Learning&quot; was unveiled at city hall on this day.

<doc id="938526" wikidata="Q1383295" url="?curid=938526" title="Francis Ouimet">
<text>Francis DeSales Ouimet () (May 8, 1893 – September 2, 1967) was an American amateur golfer who is frequently referred to as the &quot;father of amateur golf&quot; in the United States. He won the U.S. Open in 1913 and was the first non-Briton elected Captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.

==Early life==
Ouimet was born to Mary Ellen Burke and Arthur Ouimet in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb west of Boston. His father was a French-Canadian immigrant, and his mother was originally from Ireland. When Francis was four years old, his family purchased a house on Lee Street across from Clyde Street in Brookline, directly across from the 17th hole of The Country Club. The Ouimet family grew up relatively poor and were near the bottom of the economic ladder, which was hardly the position of any American golfer at the time. As far as the general public was concerned, amateur golf was reserved for the wealthy, while professional golf provided competition and income for former caddies, who were prohibited by the USGA from caddying after the age of 16 if they wanted to keep their amateur status.

Ouimet became interested in golf at an early age and started caddying at The Country Club at the age of 11. Using clubs from his brother and balls he found around the course, he taught himself to play. His game soon caught the eye of many country club members and caddie master Dan MacNamara. It was not long before Ouimet was the best high school golfer in the state. When he was a junior in high school, his father insisted that he drop out and do &quot;something useful&quot; with his life. Ouimet worked at a drygoods store before landing a job at a sporting goods store owned by future Baseball Hall of Famer George Wright.

==Golf career==
===1913 U.S. Open===
In 1913, Ouimet won his first significant title at age 20, the Massachusetts Amateur, an event he won five more times. He participated in the U.S. Amateur at the Garden City Golf Club in Long Island, New York, in early September, losing in the quarterfinals to the eventual champion, Jerome Travers. Soon after, he was asked personally by the president of the United States Golf Association, Robert Watson, if he would play in the national professional championship, the 1913 U.S. Open, which had been postponed to mid-September from its original June dates to allow for the participation of British golfers Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, both of Jersey. Vardon had won the U.S. Open in 1900 and The Open Championship five times to that point. Ray had won the Open Championship in 1912. The 1913 event was played at the course Ouimet knew best, The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. Ouimet originally declined to play, having just returned from an absence from work to play in the National Amateur. His participation in the Open was soon arranged, however, with the cooperation of his employer.

It was Ouimet&#x27;s first appearance in the championship. Eddie Lowery was his ten year old caddie. After 72 holes of regulation play ended in a three-way tie, Ouimet, Vardon, and Ray engaged in an 18-hole playoff the next day in rainy conditions. Ouimet won the playoff at one-under-par for the day, beating Vardon by 5 strokes and Ray by 6. His victory was widely hailed as a stunning upset over the strongly favored British, who were regarded as the top two golfers in the world. He was the first amateur to win the U.S. Open. The biggest crowds ever seen in American golf followed the playoff, and his achievement was front-page news across the country.

Ouimet&#x27;s U.S. Open success is credited for bringing golf into the American sporting mainstream. Before his win over Vardon and Ray, golf was dominated by British players. In America, the sport was restricted to players with access to private facilities. There were very few public courses (the first, Van Cortlandt Golf Course in The Bronx borough of New York City, opened in 1895). Ten years after his 1913 victory, the number of American players had tripled and many new courses had been built, including numerous public ones.

In 1963, WGBH-TV, Boston&#x27;s public television station, aired an interview with Ouimet at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, to mark the 50th anniversary of his win at the 1913 U.S. Open. The kinescope of that interview was included in the DVD of the Walt Disney film &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;. Disney&#x27;s film took artistic license, portraying the win as having been by a single stroke when, in reality, Ouimet won by five strokes.

===Controversy resolved===
Ouimet never turned professional; he wished to remain an amateur for his whole career, as he decided before his U.S. Open success that he wanted to work in the world of business. In 1916, however, the USGA, in one of the most controversial decisions in their history, stripped Ouimet of his amateur status. Its reasoning was that he was using his celebrity status to aid his own sporting goods business and was therefore making a living from golf. This was at the time when caddies were not allowed to continue caddying after they reached the age of 16, unless they declared themselves professionals. The decision was greeted with uproar from Ouimet&#x27;s fellow golfers. In 1918, Ouimet enlisted in the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of lieutenant. After the war, the USGA quietly reinstated his amateur status. Ouimet did not bear a grudge against the USGA and served on several committees. He was also a golf member of Charles River Country Club in Newton Centre, and was a member of the Woodland Golf Club of Auburndale.

Ouimet won his second U.S. Amateur in 1931. During the 1920s, he lost several close matches to Bobby Jones, who dominated amateur golf for that decade.

===Later achievements===
Ouimet won the U.S. Amateur twice (1914 and 1931). He played on the first eight Walker Cup Teams and was Captain of the next four for a team record of 11-1. In 1951, he became the first non-Briton elected Captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and in 1955 was the first-ever winner of the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the USGA, in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. Ouimet has been named to many golf halls of fame and has a room named after him in the USGA Museum.

Two other aspects of Ouimet&#x27;s golf career are important: He used the overlapping grip to hold the club and was among the first top players to use this method. He very likely used the grip to emulate Vardon, who often is credited with developing the grip. Many great golf champions since have used this technique. The method is named for the &quot;overlapping&#x27; of the little finger of the top hand between the forefinger and middle finger of the bottom hand. Ouimet mentored and encouraged the young Gene Sarazen, who developed into one of golf&#x27;s greatest champions.

==Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund==
In 1949, a group of Ouimet&#x27;s friends started a scholarship in his honor, naming it the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund. The scholarship was created to give college scholarship aid to young people who worked as caddies at clubs in Massachusetts. The inaugural class had 13 scholars who received a total of $4,600. Since then more than 6,300 students have been selected as Ouimet Scholars, receiving more than $43 million in need-based college tuition assistance. Today&#x27;s requirements state that young people who have given at least two years of service to golf as caddies, worked in a pro shop operations, in course superintendent operations or &quot;on-course&quot; food and beverage in Massachusetts are eligible to receive the four-year renewable Scholarship.

The Ouimet Fund overview can be found at www.ouimet.org and is the second largest &quot;caddie&quot; scholarship in the U.S. and the largest independent scholarship fund in Massachusetts. Students complete a rigorous application and interview process, similar to the college process, before being selected as a Ouimet Scholar. The final step is an interview with a group of Ouimet Alumni, directors and/or donors. Once selected, students may attend any school they wish, and annually, these Scholars attend approximately 150 different colleges or universities across the country. Since the Ouimet Fund is a need-based scholarship, awards can range anywhere from a few thousand dollars to $80,000 or more over four years.

The &quot;Francis Ouimet Award for Lifelong Contributions to Golf&quot; was first presented in 1997 and is presented annually at the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund&#x27;s banquet. Past winners include Arnold Palmer (1997), Peter Jacobsen (2006), Jack Nicklaus (2007), and Annika Sörenstam (2010) and in 2021 the Ouimet Fund honors broadcaster Jim Nantz.

==Depictions==

In 1988 a portrait of Ouimet appeared on a commemorative 25-cent United States Postal Service postage stamp in his honor.

In 2002, Mark Frost wrote a biographical account of Ouimet&#x27;s U.S. Open victory titled &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played: Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, and the Birth of Modern Golf&quot;. Shortly afterward, Frost was tapped by Walt Disney Studios to write a motion picture adaptation. &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot; was released in theaters in 2005. The film starred Shia LaBeouf as Ouimet and was directed by Bill Paxton and produced by Larry Brezner.

Appearing on the cover of &quot;The Greatest Game&quot; is a photograph of Ouimet at the U.S. Open with his ten-year-old caddie, Eddie Lowery. This iconic image is one of the best known in American golf and was used as the logo for the United States Golf Association&#x27;s Centennial celebrations. A statue of Ouimet and Lowery based on the photograph stands in Brookline, Massachusetts, and at the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida.

A street is named after Ouimet in Greenside, Johannesburg, South Africa, close to the Parkview Golf Course. A number of adjacent streets are also named after golfers, although the street in Johannesburg is named Quimet Street. How the misspelling occurred is not known. The street is still sometimes pronounced (correctly) without the Q, while it is also sometimes pronounced in the French way (Wee-May).

==Personal life==
Ouimet aspired to become a businessman to elevate himself into the middle class. The life of a professional golfer at that time did not offer an avenue to reach that goal. Within ten years of his U.S. Open victory, Ouimet had started to work as a banker and eventually a stock broker, which had always been his intention. He culminated his business career as a customer&#x27;s financial advisor at Brown Brothers Harriman.

During the First World War he served in the US Army.

He married Stella M. Sullivan on September 11, 1918. They had two daughters: Janice Salvi and Barbara McLean.

Ouimet died in Newton, Massachusetts, on September 2, 1967, at age 74.

<text>The Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) is a software system developed in the early 1990s from the work of the Open Software Foundation (OSF), a consortium founded in 1988 that included Apollo Computer (part of Hewlett-Packard from 1989), IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation, and others. The DCE supplies a framework and a toolkit for developing client/server applications. The framework includes:

* a remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism known as DCE/RPC
* a naming (directory) service
* a time service
* an authentication service
* a distributed file system (DFS) known as DCE/DFS
The DCE did not achieve commercial success.

As of 1995, all major computer hardware vendors had an implementation of DCE, seen as an advantage compared to alternatives like CORBA which all had more limited support.

==History==
As part of the formation of OSF, various members contributed many of their ongoing research projects as well as their commercial products. For example, HP/Apollo contributed its Network Computing Environment (NCS) and CMA Threads products. Siemens Nixdorf contributed its X.500 server and ASN/1 compiler tools. At the time, network computing was quite popular, and many of the companies involved were working on similar RPC-based systems. By integrating security, RPC and other distributed services on a single distributed computing environment, OSF could offer a major advantage over SVR4, allowing any DCE-supporting system (namely OSF/1) to interoperate in a larger network.

The DCE &quot;request for technology&quot; was issued by the OSF in 1989.
The first OSF DCE vendor product came out in 1992.

The DCE system was, to a large degree, based on independent developments made by each of the partners. DCE/RPC was derived from the &quot;Network Computing System&quot; (NCS) created at Apollo Computer. The naming service was derived from work done at Digital. DCE/DFS was based on the Andrew File System (AFS) originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University. The authentication system was based on Kerberos. By combining these features, DCE offers a fairly complete system for network computing. Any machine on the network can authenticate its users, gain access to resources, and call them remotely using a single integrated API.

The rise of the Internet, Java and web services stole much of DCE&#x27;s mindshare through the mid-to-late 1990s, and competing systems such as CORBA appeared as well.

One of the major uses of DCE today is Microsoft&#x27;s DCOM and ODBC systems, which use DCE/RPC (in MSRPC) as their network transport layer.

OSF and its projects eventually became part of The Open Group, which released DCE 1.2.2 under a free software license (the LGPL) on 12 January 2005.

DCE 1.1 was available much earlier under the OSF BSD license, and resulted in FreeDCE being available since 2000. FreeDCE contains an implementation of DCOM.

One of the major systems built on top of DCE was Encina, developed by Transarc (later acquired by IBM). IBM used Encina as a foundation to port its primary mainframe transaction processing system (CICS) to non-mainframe platforms, as IBM TXSeries. (However, later versions of TXSeries have removed the Encina component.)

==Architecture==

DCE is intended to support high availability systems: when a server does not respond (because of server failure or communications failure), clients can be constructed to automatically use a replica of that server instead.

The largest unit of management in DCE is a &quot;cell&quot;. The highest privileges within a cell are assigned to a role called &quot;cell administrator&quot;, normally assigned to the &quot;user&quot; &quot;cell_admin&quot;. Multiple cells can be configured to communicate and share resources with each other. All principals from external cells are treated as &quot;foreign&quot; users and privileges can be awarded or removed accordingly. In addition to this, specific users or groups can be assigned privileges on any DCE resource, something which is not possible with the traditional UNIX filesystem, which lacks ACL&#x27;s.

Major components of DCE within every cell are:
#The Security Server that is responsible for authentication
#The Cell Directory Server (CDS) that is the repository of resources and ACLs and
#The Distributed Time Server that provides an accurate clock for proper functioning of the entire cell

Modern DCE implementations such as IBM&#x27;s are fully capable of interoperating with Kerberos as the security server, LDAP for the CDS and the Network Time Protocol implementations for the time server.

DCE/DFS is a DCE-based application which provides a distributed filesystem on DCE. DCE/DFS can support replicas of a fileset (the DCE/DFS equivalent of a filesystem) on multiple DFS servers - there is one read-write copy and zero or more read only copies. Replication is supported between the read-write and the read-only copies. In addition, DCE/DFS also supports what are called &quot;backup&quot; filesets, which if defined for a fileset are capable of storing a version of the fileset as it was prior to the last replication.

DCE/DFS is believed to be the world&#x27;s only distributed filesystem that correctly implements the full POSIX filesystem semantics, including byte range locking.

DCE/DFS was sufficiently reliable and stable to be utilised by IBM to run the back-end filesystem for the 1996 Olympics web site, seamlessly and automatically distributed and edited worldwide in different time zones.

<text>Edric Thornton Bates MBE (3 May 1918 – 28 November 2003) was an English professional footballer who played as a forward. He spent the majority of his career at Southampton F.C. as a player, manager, director and president which earned him the sobriquet &quot;Mr. Southampton&quot;.

Bates was the son of Eddie Bates, who played cricket for Yorkshire and Glamorgan and football for Bolton Wanderers and Leeds United. He was the grandson of Billy Bates who was one of the finest all-rounders for England in the early years of international cricket.

==Playing career==

Bates was born in Thetford and joined Saints on his 19th birthday in 1937, transferring from Norwich City. He soon forced his way into the first team as a centre-forward. His career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which league football was suspended in England. He initially joined the War Reserve police force, spending his time on guard duty at the Shell-Mex oil depot at Hamble or the Pirelli-General cable works at Woolston. In the early part of the war, Bates still managed regular appearances for Saints in the wartime cups and leagues.

On 8 June 1940, Bates married Mary Smith at St. James&#x27;s Church in Shirley, and that evening watched Saints play Charlton Athletic at The Dell. Shortly afterwards the Bates&#x27; home was bombed and they moved to West Wellow, where Mary found work with the NAAFI. Bates resigned from the War Reserve and went to work at the Folland Aircraft factory at Hamble, who also had a very good works football team, Folland Aircraft, which, as well as Bates, included other professional players such as Bill Dodgin (Southampton), Harold Pond (Carlisle United), Bert Tann (Charlton), Dick Foss (Chelsea), Bill Bushby, Cliff Parker and Bill Rochford (all Portsmouth). Most of these players also guested for Saints in the War leagues.

Bates&#x27; finest playing days came between 1947 and 1951 when he formed a great partnership with Charlie Wayman.

After some declining performances on the pitch, Bates made his last first-team appearance on 20 December 1952 at home to West Ham United. During his career he made 216 appearances, scoring 64 times.

==Management==

After retiring from playing, he became a coach at Southampton in May 1953; advancing to manager in September 1955, taking over from George Roughton. Southampton were in the regional Third Division South when he took over as manager. They were promoted to the national Second Division in 1959 when they finished as champions of the Third Division with Derek Reeves scoring 39 league goals, a club record.

Southampton were promoted to the First Division in 1966. Under his management, the team maintained their First Division status, developing young players such as Mick Channon and Ron Davies, and qualifying for European football in 1969 and 1971.

Bates decided to step down as manager in December 1973 and was replaced by Lawrie McMenemy. He was manager for 18 years, a record for the club. Bates acted as McMenemy&#x27;s assistant for the next few years, which included Southampton&#x27;s historic FA Cup victory in 1976. Bates was the first person to congratulate McMenemy and the players as the final whistle was blown at Wembley.

==Honours==
Bates then joined the Saints&#x27; board, where he would serve as a director for another 20 years before being appointed the club&#x27;s president. He received the freedom of the city of Southampton in 1998 and was honoured with the MBE in the 2001 New Year Honours for services to Southampton Football Club.

==Death==
Bates was widely regarded as a local hero for his dedication to the club over a period of 66 years, and his death in November 2003 was widely commemorated by the club and supporters&#x27; community.

The first game after his death was the home match against Portsmouth in the League Cup and was the first derby between the two local rivals since an FA Cup match at The Dell in 1996. A minute&#x27;s silence in Bates&#x27; memory barely lasted 30 seconds after jeers and boos from fans in the away end. Those who booed and jeered were widely criticised by the media and by fellow Portsmouth fans.

==Ted Bates Trophy==
In 2004, the Ted Bates Trophy was inaugurated with a match against Bayern Munich. It was an annual friendly match held in Bates&#x27; honour by Southampton.

==Statue controversy==
A statue of Bates was unveiled outside the main entrance to St Mary&#x27;s Stadium on 17 March 2007. The statue cost approximately £112,000, half of which was raised by fans via the Ted Bates Trust, and the other half met by Southampton Football Club.

The statue was widely criticised by supporters just hours after its uncovering, for having &quot;tiny&quot; arms and bearing a closer likeness to former Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandarić than Bates, so the club pledged to organise a replacement. The replacement statue, by sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn, was unveiled on Saturday 22 March 2008.

<text>William Thomas Romanowski (born April 2, 1966) is an American former professional football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons. Nicknamed &quot;Romo&quot; and &quot;RomoCop&quot;, he spent the majority of his career with the San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos. Romanowski was selected by the 49ers in the third round of the 1988 NFL draft and played six seasons each in San Francisco and Denver. Romanowski was also a member of the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders for two seasons each. Over his career, Romanowski won four Super Bowl titles, two each with the 49ers and Broncos, and twice received Pro Bowl honors during his Broncos tenure. He also led a controversial career due to often engaging in unsportsmanlike behavior, which resulted in altercations with opponents and teammates.

== Early life and education ==
Romanowski was born in Vernon, Connecticut. He graduated from Rockville High School in 1984 and Boston College in 1988 with academic honors, and was a Scanlan Award recipient.

== NFL career ==
Romanowski went on to a 16-year career in the NFL, playing for the San Francisco 49ers (1988–1993), Philadelphia Eagles (1994–1995), Denver Broncos (1996–2001), and Oakland Raiders (2002–2003). After his career, he was listed by ESPN as the fifth dirtiest player in professional team sports history.

Romanowski played 243 consecutive games during the 1988–2003 seasons, an NFL record that stood until Chris Gardocki broke it during the 2006 season, finishing his career with 265, (256 regular season and nine playoff games). He won four Super Bowl Championships, and played in five Super Bowls (Super Bowl XXIII, Super Bowl XXIV, Super Bowl XXXII, Super Bowl XXXIII and Super Bowl XXXVII). His only loss was in the last of these.

During his 16-year career, Romanowski compiled 1,105 tackles, 39.5 sacks, 18 forced fumbles, and 18 interceptions, which he returned for a net total of 98 yards and one career touchdown. Romanowski was a Pro Bowl selection twice, in 1996 and 1998, both during his tenure with the Denver Broncos.

=== Altercations ===
Romanowski was involved in numerous altercations with both teammates and opponents. In 1995, while with the Eagles, he was ejected from a game — and subsequently fined $4,500 — for kicking Arizona Cardinals fullback Larry Centers in the head.

Two more incidents occurred during the 1997 season while he played for the Broncos. In the first, he was fined $20,000 after a helmet-to-helmet hit on Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins in a preseason game resulting in Collins sustaining a broken jaw.

In the second incident, Romanowski spat in the face of 49ers wide receiver J. J. Stokes in a regular-season game played in December on a Monday night in response to Stokes&#x27; taunting.

Two years later, while still with the Broncos, he was fined a total of $42,500 for three illegal hits plus a punch thrown at Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, and was also fined an undisclosed amount for throwing a football at Bryan Cox of the New York Jets, the ball hitting him in the crotch area.

==== Marcus Williams incident ====
In 2003, Romanowski attacked and injured one of his teammates, tight end Marcus Williams, during a scrimmage. Williams was forced to retire after Romanowski crushed his eye socket with the punch.

Williams sued for damages of $3.4 million, arguing that Romanowski had been suffering from &quot;roid rage&quot; when he attacked him. Williams was awarded $340,000 for lost wages and medical expenses by a jury. Williams was quoted as saying he and his lawyers &quot;just wanted to prove what was right and wrong about football&quot;. Williams&#x27; attorney said he was very pleased with the verdict.

==== Racism allegations ====
Romanowski has been accused of being racist at many points during his career and after retirement. Various media critics have pointed to his fines for actions including kicking Larry Centers in the head in 1995, spitting on San Francisco 49er receiver J.J. Stokes in 1997, and ripping Eddie George&#x27;s helmet off in 2002, as evidence.

Romanowski called Carolina Panthers starting quarterback Cam Newton &quot;boy&quot; in a tweet after Newton&#x27;s team lost in Super Bowl 50 and Newton conducted a very brief press interview. He later apologized after he was accused of being racist.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
==Post-NFL career==
Romanowski co-authored an autobiography in 2005 titled &quot;Romo My Life on the Edge: Living Dreams and Slaying Dragons&quot;. The book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling book in 2005. It chronicles his childhood, college career, NFL career, living with post-concussion symptoms, nutrition, and recovery techniques used during his NFL playing career.

He was featured on the cover of the Midway Games title &quot;&quot; and adds his voice as Bruno Battaglia, a linebacker in the game who wears his 53. He also appears in NCAA Football Series indirectly as LB #53 for the 1984 Boston College Eagles.

In 2006, he founded Nutrition53, a nutritional supplement company. He was also a minority owner of NASCAR&#x27;s Swan Racing in 2013; Nutrition53 sponsored the team in 10 races that year.

In 2024 Romanowski and his wife declared bankruptcy after being sued by the I.R.S. for more than $15 million in unpaid back taxes.

=== Football ===
In 2008, Romanowski was the defensive coordinator for the Piedmont High School (California) Highlanders Freshman Football team, where his son played.

In January 2009, Romanowski threw his name into the search for Mike Shanahan&#x27;s replacement as the head coach of the Denver Broncos. Romanowski sent a 30-page PowerPoint presentation to team owner Pat Bowlen, but was not considered for the job. The job was ultimately given to Josh McDaniels.

===BALCO Scandal===
Romanowski and his wife were investigated for prescription drug fraud, though the charges were later dropped. Records seized by the government belonging to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, later discovered to be the source of a designer steroid, indicate that he had used the anabolic steroid &quot;The Clear&quot; and synthetic testosterone ointment &quot;The Cream&quot; provided by BALCO since 2003. Romanowski admitted to staying a step ahead of NFL drug testing policies. In an October 16, 2005 appearance on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Romanowski admitted to using steroids and human growth hormone that he received from Victor Conte, BALCO owner.

<doc id="938546" wikidata="Q600093" url="?curid=938546" title="Habsburg Spain">
<text>Habsburg Spain refers to Spain and the Hispanic Monarchy, also known as the Catholic Monarchy, in the period from 1516 to 1700 when it was ruled by kings from the House of Habsburg. It had territories around the world, including modern-day Spain, a piece of south-eastern France, eventually Portugal and many other lands outside the Iberian Peninsula, including in the Americas and Asia. In this period the Spanish Empire was at the zenith of its influence and power. It then expanded to include territories over the five continents, consisting of much of the American continent and islands thereof, the West Indies in the Americas, the Low Countries, Italian territories and parts of France in Europe and the Philippines and other possessions in Southeast Asia. The period of Spanish history has also been referred to as the &quot;Age of Expansion&quot;.

The Habsburg name was not continuously used by the family members, since they often emphasized their more prestigious princely titles. The dynasty was thus long known as the &quot;House of Austria&quot;. Complementary, in some circumstances the family members were identified by their place of birth. Charles V was known in his youth after his birthplace as Charles of Ghent. When he became king of Spain he was known as Charles I of Spain, and after he was elected emperor, as Charles V (in French, &quot;Charles Quint&quot;). In Spain, the dynasty was known as the &quot;Casa de Austria&quot;, including illegitimate sons such as John of Austria and John Joseph of Austria. The arms displayed in their simplest form were those of Austria, which the Habsburgs had made their own, at times impaled with the arms of the Duchy of Burgundy (ancient), as seen on the arms of John of Austria. Calling this era &quot;Habsburg&quot;, is, to some extent, a convenience for historians.

The marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1469 resulted in the union of the two main crowns, Castile and Aragon, which eventually led to the &quot;de facto&quot; unification of Spain after the culmination of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; with the conquest of Granada in 1492 and of Navarre in 1512 to 1529. Isabella and Ferdinand were bestowed the title of &quot;Catholic King and Queen&quot; by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. With the Habsburgs, the term &quot;Monarchia Catholica&quot; (Catholic Monarchy, Modern Spanish: &quot;Monarquía Católica&quot;) remained in use. Spain continued to be one of the greatest political and military powers in Europe and the world for much of the 16th and 17th centuries. During the Habsburg&#x27;s period, Spain ushered in the Spanish Golden Age of arts and literature producing some of the world&#x27;s most outstanding writers and painters and influential intellectuals, including Teresa of Ávila, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Miguel de Cervantes, Francisco de Quevedo, Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Domingo de Soto, Francisco Suárez and Francisco de Vitoria.
After the death in 1700 of Spain&#x27;s last Habsburg king, Charles II, the resulting War of the Spanish Succession led to the ascension of Philip V of the Bourbon dynasty, which began a new centralising state formation, which came into being &quot;de jure&quot; after the Nueva Planta decrees that merged the multiple crowns of its former realms (except for Navarre).

== History ==

=== Beginnings of the empire (1504–1521) ===
In 1504, Isabella I of Castile died, and although Ferdinand II of Aragon tried to maintain his position over Castile in the wake of her death, the Castilian (the parliament) chose to crown Isabella&#x27;s daughter Joanna of Castile as queen. Her husband, Philip I of Castile, was the Habsburg son of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and Mary of Burgundy. Shortly thereafter Joanna began to lapse into insanity, although the extent of her mental illness remains the topic of some debate. In 1506, Philip I was declared &quot;jure uxoris&quot; king, but he died later that year under mysterious circumstances, possibly poisoned by his father-in-law, Ferdinand II. Since their oldest son Charles was only six, the Cortes reluctantly allowed Joanna&#x27;s father Ferdinand II to rule the country as the regent of Queen Joanna and Charles.

Spain was now in personal union under Ferdinand II of Aragon. As undisputed ruler in most of the Peninsula, Ferdinand adopted a more aggressive policy than he had as Isabella&#x27;s husband, going on to crystallize his long-running designs over Navarre into a full-blown invasion led initially by a Castilian military expedition, and supported later by Aragonese troops (1512). He also attempted to enlarge Spain&#x27;s sphere of influence in Italy, strengthening it against France. As ruler of Aragon, Ferdinand had been involved in the struggle against France and the Republic of Venice for control of Italy. These conflicts became the center of Ferdinand&#x27;s foreign policy as king. Ferdinand&#x27;s first investment of Spanish forces came in the War of the League of Cambrai against Venice, where the Spanish soldiers distinguished themselves on the field alongside their French allies at the Battle of Agnadello (1509). Only a year later, Ferdinand joined the Holy League against France, seeing a chance at taking both Naples (to which he held a dynastic claim) and Navarre, which was claimed through his marriage to Germaine of Foix. The war was less of a success than that against Venice, and in 1516 France agreed to a truce that left Milan under French control and recognized Spanish hegemony in northern Navarre. Ferdinand would die later that year.

Ferdinand&#x27;s death led to the ascension of young Charles to both Spanish thrones as Charles I of Castile and Aragon, further solidifying the monarchy of Spain. His inheritance included all the Spanish possessions in the New World and around the Mediterranean. Upon the death of his Habsburg father in 1506, Charles had inherited the Habsburg Netherlands and Franche-Comté, growing up in Flanders. In 1519, with the death of his paternal grandfather Maximilian I, Charles inherited the Habsburg territories in Germany, and was duly elected as Holy Roman Emperor that year. His mother Joanna remained titular queen of Castile until her death in 1555, but due to her mental health and worries of her being proposed as an alternative monarch by opposition (as happened in the Revolt of the Comuneros), Charles kept her imprisoned.

At that point, Emperor and King Charles was the most powerful man in Christendom. The accumulation of so much power by one man and one dynasty greatly concerned Francis I of France, who found himself surrounded by Habsburg territories. In 1521 Francis invaded the Spanish possessions in Italy and Navarre, which inaugurated a second round of Franco-Spanish conflict. The war was a disaster for France, which suffered defeats at Biccoca (1522), Pavia (1525, at which Francis was captured), and Landriano (1529) before Francis relented and abandoned Milan to Spain once more. Spain&#x27;s overseas possessions in the New World were based in the Caribbean and the Spanish Main and consisted of a rapidly decreasing indigenous population, few resources of value to the crown, and a sparse Spanish settler population. The situation changed dramatically with the expedition of Hernán Cortés, who, with alliances with city-states hostile to the Aztecs and thousands of indigenous Mexican warriors, conquered the Aztec Empire in 1521. Following the pattern established in Spain during the Reconquista and in the Caribbean, the first European settlements in the Americas, conquerors divided up the indigenous population in private holdings &quot;encomiendas&quot; and exploited their labor. With Americas colonization, Spain gained vast new indigenous populations to convert to Christianity and rule as vassals of the crown. Charles established the Council of the Indies in 1524 to oversee all of Castile&#x27;s overseas possessions. Charles appointed a viceroy in Mexico in 1535, capping the royal governance of the high court, &quot;Real Audiencia&quot;, and treasury officials with the highest royal official. Officials were under the jurisdiction of the Council of the Indies. Charles promulgated the New Laws of 1542 to limit the power of the Conquistadors to form a hereditary aristocracy that might challenge the power of the crown.

=== Charles, an emperor and a king (1521–1558) ===


Charles&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Pavia (1525) surprised many Italians and Germans and elicited concerns that Charles would endeavor to gain even greater power. Pope Clement VII switched sides and now joined forces with France and prominent Italian states against the Habsburg Emperor, in the War of the League of Cognac. In 1527, due to Charles&#x27; inability to pay them sufficiently, his armies in Northern Italy mutinied and sacked Rome itself for loot, forcing Clement, and succeeding popes, to be considerably more prudent in their dealings with secular authorities. In 1533, Clement&#x27;s refusal to annul Henry VIII of England&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon (Charles&#x27; aunt) was a direct consequence of his unwillingness to offend the Emperor and perhaps have his capital sacked a second time. The Peace of Barcelona, signed between Charles and the pope in 1529, established a more cordial relationship between the two leaders that effectively made Charles the protector of the Catholic cause and recognized Charles as King of Italy in return for Imperial-Spanish intervention in overthrowing the rebellious Republic of Florence.

The Protestant Reformation had begun in Germany in 1517. Charles, through his position as Holy Roman Emperor, his important holdings along Germany&#x27;s frontiers, and his close relationship with his Habsburg relatives in Austria, had a vested interest in maintaining the stability of the Holy Roman Empire. The German Peasants&#x27; War broke out in Germany in 1524 and ravaged the country until it was brutally put down in 1526. Charles, even as far away from Germany as he was, was committed to keeping order. After the Peasants&#x27; War the Protestants organized themselves into a defensive league to protect themselves from Emperor Charles. Under the protection of the Schmalkaldic League, the Protestant states committed a number of outrages in the eyes of the Catholic Church (the confiscation of some ecclesiastical territories, among other things) and defied the authority of the Emperor.

In 1543, Francis I, King of France, announced his unprecedented alliance with the Ottoman sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, by occupying the Spanish-controlled city of Nice in cooperation with Turkish forces. Henry VIII of England, who bore a greater grudge against France than he held against the Emperor for standing in the way of his divorce, joined Charles in his invasion of France. Although the Spanish army was soundly defeated at the Battle of Ceresole, in Savoy Henry fared better, and France was forced to accept terms. The Austrians, led by Charles&#x27;s younger brother Ferdinand, continued to fight the Ottomans in the east. With France defeated, Charles went to take care of an older problem: the Schmalkaldic League.

Perhaps more important to the strategy of the Spanish king, the League had allied itself with the French, and efforts in Germany to undermine the League had been rebuffed. Francis&#x27;s defeat in 1544 led to the annulment of the alliance with the Protestants, and Charles took advantage of the opportunity. He first tried the path of negotiation at the Council of Trent in 1545, but the Protestant leadership, feeling betrayed by the stance taken by the Catholics at the council, went to war, led by the Elector of Saxony Maurice. In response, Charles invaded Germany at the head of a mixed Dutch-Spanish army, hoping to restore the Imperial authority. The Emperor personally inflicted a decisive defeat on the Protestants at the historic Battle of Mühlberg in 1547. In 1555, Charles signed the Peace of Augsburg with the Protestant states and restored stability in Germany on his principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; (&quot;whose realm, his religion&quot;). Charles&#x27;s involvement in Germany would establish a role for Spain as protector of the Catholic Habsburg cause in the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1526, Charles married Infanta Isabella, the sister of John III of Portugal. In 1556 he abdicated from his positions, giving his Spanish empire to his only surviving son, Philip II of Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire to his brother, Ferdinand. Charles retired to the monastery of Yuste (Extremadura, Spain), and died in 1558.

=== Philip II (1558–1598) ===
Spain was not yet at peace, as the aggressive Henry II of France came to the throne in 1547 and renewed the conflict between the two countries four years later. Charles&#x27; successor, Philip II, aggressively conducted the war against France, crushing a French army at the Battle of St. Quentin in Picardy in 1557 and defeating Henry again at the Battle of Gravelines the following year. The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, signed in 1559, permanently recognized Spanish claims in Italy. In the celebrations that followed the treaty, Henry was killed by a stray splinter from a lance. France was stricken for the next forty years by civil war and unrest and was unable to effectively compete with Spain and the Habsburgs in the European power struggle. Freed from any serious French opposition, Spain saw the height of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559–1643.

The Spanish Empire had grown substantially since the days of Ferdinand and Isabella. The Aztec and Inca empires were conquered during Charles&#x27; reign, from 1519 to 1521 and 1540 to 1558, respectively. Spanish settlements were established in the New World: Mexico City, the most important colonial city established in 1524 to be the primary center of administration in the New World; Florida, colonized in the 1560s; Buenos Aires, established in 1536; and New Granada (modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela), colonized in the 1530s. The Spanish Empire abroad became the source of Spanish wealth and power in Europe. But as precious metal shipments rapidly expanded late in the century it contributed to the general inflation that was affecting the whole of Europe. Instead of fueling the Spanish economy, American silver made the country increasingly dependent on foreign sources of raw materials and manufactured goods. In 1557, Spain was forced, for the first of many times, to declare a sovereign default, requiring it to partially repudiate its debt through consolidation and conversion.

The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559 concluded the war with France, leaving Spain at a considerable advantage. However, the government was still mired in debt, and declared bankruptcy that year. Most of the government&#x27;s revenues came from taxes and excise duties, not imported silver and other goods. The Ottoman Empire had long menaced the fringes of the Habsburg dominions in Austria and northwest Africa. In response Ferdinand and Isabella had sent expeditions to North Africa, capturing Melilla in 1497 and Oran in 1509. Charles had preferred to combat the Ottomans through a considerably more maritime strategy, hampering Ottoman landings on the Venetian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only in response to raids on the eastern coast of Spain did Charles personally lead attacks against holdings in North Africa (1535). In 1560, the Ottomans battled the Spanish Navy off the coast of Tunisia, but in 1565 Ottoman troops landing on the strategically vital island of Malta, defended by the Knights of St. John, were defeated. The death of Suleiman the Magnificent the following year and his succession by Selim II emboldened Philip, who resolved to carry the war to the Ottoman homelands. In 1571, a mixed naval expedition of Spanish, Venetian, and Papal ships led by Charles&#x27; illegitimate son Don John of Austria annihilated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto, in the largest naval battle fought in European waters since Actium in 31 BC. The fleet included Miguel de Cervantes, future author of the historic Spanish novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The victory curbed the Ottoman naval threat against European territory, particularly in the western Mediterranean, and the loss of experienced sailors was to be a major handicap in facing Christian fleets. Yet the Turks succeeded in rebuilding their navy in a year, using it handily to consolidate Ottoman dominance over most of the Mediterranean&#x27;s African coast and eastern islands. Philip lacked the resources to fight both the Netherlands and the Ottoman Empire at the same time, and the stalemate in the Mediterranean continued until Spain agreed to a truce in 1580.

The time for rejoicing in Madrid was short-lived. In 1566, Calvinist-led riots in the Habsburg Netherlands (roughly equal to modern-day Netherlands and Belgium, inherited by Philip from Charles and his Burgundian forebears) prompted Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba to conduct a military expedition to restore order. Alba launched an ensuing reign of terror. In 1568, William the Silent led a failed attempt to drive Alba from the Netherlands. This attempt is generally considered to signal the start of the Eighty Years&#x27; War that ended with the independence of the United Provinces. The Spanish, who derived a great deal of wealth from the Netherlands and particularly from the vital port of Antwerp, were committed to restoring order and maintaining their hold on the provinces. In 1572, a band of rebel Dutch privateers known as the &quot;watergeuzen&quot; (&quot;Sea Beggars&quot;) seized a number of Dutch coastal towns, proclaimed their support for William and denounced the Spanish leadership.

In 1574, the Spanish army under Luis de Requeséns was repulsed from the Siege of Leiden after the Dutch destroyed the dykes that held back the North Sea from the low-lying provinces. In 1576, faced with the costs of his 80,000-man army of occupation in the Netherlands and the massive fleet that had won at Lepanto, Philip was forced to accept bankruptcy. The army in the Netherlands mutinied not long after, seizing Antwerp and looting the southern Netherlands, prompting several cities in the previously peaceful southern provinces to join the rebellion. The Spanish chose the route of negotiation, and pacified most of the southern provinces again with the Union of Arras in 1579.

The Arras agreement required all Spanish troops to leave the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Philip had his eye on uniting the entire Iberian Peninsula under his rule, a traditional objective of Spanish monarchs. The opportunity came in 1578 when the Portuguese king Sebastian launched a crusade against the Saadi Sultanate of Morocco. The expedition ended in disaster and Sebastian&#x27;s disappearance at the Battle of the Three Kings. His aged uncle Henry ruled until he died in 1580. Although Philip had long prepared for the takeover of Portugal, he still found it necessary to launch a military occupation led by the Duke of Alba. Philip took the title of King of Portugal, but otherwise the country remained autonomous, retaining its own laws, currency, and institutions. However, Portugal surrendered all independence in foreign policy, and relations between the two countries were never warm.

France formed the cornerstone of Spanish foreign policy. For 30 years after Cateau-Cambrésis, it was engulfed in civil war. After 1590, the Spanish intervened directly in France on the side of the Catholic League, winning battles, but failing to prevent Henry of Navarre from becoming king as Henry IV. To Spain&#x27;s dismay, Pope Clement VIII accepted Henry into the Catholic Church.

To keep the Netherlands under control required an extensive occupation force, and Spain was still financially strapped since the 1576 bankruptcy. In 1584, William the Silent was assassinated by a Catholic, and the death of the popular Dutch resistance leader was expected to bring an end to the war. However it did not happen. In 1586, Queen Elizabeth I of England, supported the Protestant cause in the Netherlands and France. Sir Francis Drake launched attacks against Spanish merchants in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, along with a particularly aggressive attack on the port of Cádiz. Philip sent the Spanish Armada to attack England. Numbering 130 ships and 30,000 men, it was led by Alonso de Guzmán y Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Armada&#x27;s goal was to ferry the Army of Flanders from the Netherlands to invade England. After three days of fighting with the English fleet, the Armada withdrew and was forced to make the journey around the coast of Scotland and Ireland, many ships being wrecked by storms.

Spain had invested itself in the religious warfare in France after Henry II&#x27;s death. In 1589, Henry III, the last of the House of Valois, died at the walls of Paris. His successor, Henry IV, the first king from the House of Bourbon, was a man of great ability, winning key victories against the Catholic League at Arques (1589) and Ivry (1590). Committed to stopping Henry from becoming king of France, the Spanish divided their army in the Netherlands and invaded France in 1590.

Faced with wars against England, France, and the Netherlands, the Spanish government found that neither the New World silver nor steadily increasing taxes were enough to cover their expenses, and went bankrupt again in 1596. To bring finances into order, military campaigns were reduced and the over-stretched forces went into a largely defensive mode. In 1598, shortly before his death, Philip II made peace with France, withdrawing his forces from French territory and stopping payments to the Catholic League after accepting the new convert to Catholicism, Henry IV, as the rightful French king. Meanwhile, Castile was ravaged by a plague that had arrived by ship from the north, losing half a million people. Yet as the 17th century began, and despite her travails, Spain was still unquestionably the dominant power.

==== Ottoman Turks, the Mediterranean, and North Africa during Philip II&#x27;s rule ====
The first years of his reign, from 1556 to 1566, Philip II was concerned principally with Muslim allies of the Turks, based in Tripoli and Algiers, the bases from which North African (Muslim) forces under the corsair Dragut preyed upon Christian shipping. In 1560, a Spanish-led Christian fleet was sent to recapture Tripoli (captured by Spain in 1510), but the fleet was destroyed by the Ottomans at the Battle of Djerba. The Ottomans attempted to seize the Spanish military-bases of Oran and Mers El Kébir on the North African coast in 1563, but were repulsed. In 1565, the Ottomans sent a large expedition to Malta, which laid siege to several forts on the island. A Spanish relief force from Sicily drove the Ottomans (exhausted from a long siege) away from the island. The death of Suleiman the Magnificent the following year and his succession by his less capable son Selim II emboldened Philip, who resolved to carry the war to the Sultan himself.

In 1571, a Christian fleet, led by Philip&#x27;s half-brother John of Austria, annihilated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in the waters off southwestern Greece. Despite the significant victory, however, the Holy League&#x27;s disunity prevented the victors from capitalizing on their triumph. Plans to seize the Dardanelles as a step towards recovering Constantinople for Christendom, were ruined by bickering amongst the allies. With a massive effort, the Ottoman Empire rebuilt its navy. Within six months a new fleet was able to reassert Ottoman naval supremacy in the eastern Mediterranean. John captured Tunis (in present-day Tunisia) from the Ottomans in 1573, but it was soon lost again. The Ottoman sultan agreed to a truce in the Mediterranean with Philip in 1580. In the western Mediterranean, Philip pursued a defensive policy with the construction of a series of military forts (presidios) and peace agreements with some of the Muslim rulers of North Africa.

In the first half of the 17th century, Spanish ships attacked the Anatolian coast, defeating larger Ottoman fleets at the Battle of Cape Celidonia and the Battle of Cape Corvo. Larache and La Mamora, on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, and the island of Alhucemas, in the Mediterranean, were taken. However, during the second half of the 17th century, Larache and La Mamora were also lost.

==== Conflicts in North-West Europe ====

Philip led Spain into the final phase of the Italian Wars, crushing a French army at the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) in Picardy and defeating the French again at the Battle of Gravelines. The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, signed in 1559, permanently recognized Spanish claims in Italy. France was stricken for the next thirty years by chronic civil war and unrest. During this period, it was removed from effectively competing with Spain and the Habsburg family in European power games. Freed from effective French opposition, Spain attained the apogee of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559–1643.

In 1566, Calvinist-led riots in the Netherlands prompted the Duke of Alba to march into Brussels at the head of a large army to restore order. In 1568, William of Orange, a German nobleman, led a failed attempt to drive Alba from the Netherlands. The Battle of Rheindalen is often seen as the unofficial start of the Eighty Years&#x27; War that led to the separation of the northern and southern Netherlands and to the formation of the United Provinces. The Spanish, who derived a great deal of wealth from the Netherlands and particularly from the vital port of Antwerp, were committed to restoring order and maintaining their hold on the provinces. During the initial phase of the war, the revolt was largely unsuccessful. Spain regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. This period is known as the &quot;Spanish Fury&quot; due to the high number of massacres, instances of mass looting, and total destruction of multiple cities between 1572 and 1579.

In January 1579, Friesland, Gelderland, Groningen, Holland, Overijssel, Utrecht and Zeeland formed the United Provinces which became the Dutch Netherlands of today. Meanwhile, Spain sent Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma with 20,000 well-trained troops into the Netherlands. Groningen, Breda, Kampen, Dunkirk, Antwerp, and Brussels, among others, were put to siege. Farnese eventually secured the Southern provinces for Spain. After the Spanish capture of Maastricht in 1579, the Dutch began to turn on William of Orange. William was assassinated by a supporter of Philip in 1584.

After the Fall of Antwerp, the Queen of England began to aid the Northern provinces and sent troops there in 1585. English forces under Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and then Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, faced the Spanish in the Netherlands under Farnese in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of Spanish troops and bought time for the Dutch to reorganize their defenses. The Spanish Armada suffered defeat at the hands of the English in 1588 and the situation in the Netherlands became increasingly difficult to manage. Maurice of Nassau, William&#x27;s son, recaptured Deventer, Groningen, Nijmegen and Zutphen. The Spanish were on the defensive, mainly because they had wasted too much resources on the attempted invasion of England and on expeditions in northern France. In 1595, Henry IV of France declared war on Spain, further reducing its ability to launch offensive warfare on the United Provinces. Philip had been forced to declare bankruptcy in 1557, 1560, 1576 and 1596. However, by regaining control of the sea, Spain was able to greatly increase the supply of gold and silver from America, which allowed it to increase military pressure on England and France.

Under financial and military pressure, in 1598 Philip ceded the Spanish Netherlands to his daughter Isabella Clara Eugenia, following the conclusion of the Treaty of Vervins with France.

==== Spanish America ====
Under Philip II, royal power over the Indies increased, but the crown knew little about its overseas possessions. Although the Council of the Indies was tasked with oversight there, it acted without advice of high officials with direct colonial experience. Another serious problem was that the crown did not know what Spanish laws were in force there. To remedy the situation, Philip appointed Juan de Ovando, who was named president of the council, to give advice. Ovando appointed a &quot;chronicler and cosmographer of the Indies&quot;, Juan López de Velasco, to gather information about the crown&#x27;s holdings, which resulted in the Relaciones geográficas in the 1580s.

The crown sought greater control over encomenderos, who had attempted to establish themselves as a local aristocracy; strengthened the power of the ecclesiastical hierarchy; shored up religious orthodoxy by the establishment of the Inquisition in Lima and Mexico City (1571); and increased revenues from silver mines in Peru and in Mexico, discovered in the 1540s. Particularly important was the crown&#x27;s appointment of two able viceroys, Don Francisco de Toledo as Viceroy of Peru (r. 1569–1581), and in New Spain, Martín Enríquez de Almanza (r. 1568–1580), who was subsequently appointed viceroy to replace Toledo in Peru.

In Peru, after decades of political unrest, with ineffective viceroys and encomenderos wielding undue power, weak royal institutions, a renegade Neo-Inca State existing in Vilcabamba, and waning revenue from the Cerro Rico silver mine of Potosí, Toledo&#x27;s appointment was a major step forward for royal control. He built on reforms attempted under earlier viceroys, but he is often credited with a major transformation in crown rule in Peru. Toledo formalized the labor draft of Andean commoners, the mit&#x27;a, to guarantee a labor supply for both the silver mine at Potosí and the mercury mine at Huancavelica. He established administrative districts of &quot;corregimiento&quot;, and resettled native Andeans in reducciones to better rule them. Under Toledo, the last stronghold of the Inca state was destroyed and the last Inca emperor, Túpac Amaru, was executed. Silver from Potosí flowed to coffers in Spain and paid for Spain&#x27;s wars in Europe.

In New Spain, Viceroy Enríquez organized the defense of the northern frontier against nomadic and bellicose indigenous groups, who attacked the transport lines of silver from the northern mines. In the religious sphere, the crown sought to bring the power of the religious orders under control with the &quot;Ordenanza del Patronazgo&quot;, ordering friars to give up their Indian parishes and turn them over to the diocesan clergy, who were more closely controlled by the crown.

The Spanish Inquisition expanded to the Indies in 1565 and was in place by 1570 in Lima and Mexico City. It drew many colonial Spaniards into torture chambers. Native Americans were exempt.

The crown expanded its global claims and defended existing ones in the Indies. Transpacific explorations had resulted in Spain claiming the Philippines and the establishment of Spanish settlements and trade with New Spain. The viceroyalty of New Spain was given jurisdiction over the Philippines, which became the entrepôt for Asian trade. Philip&#x27;s succession to the crown of Portugal in 1580 complicated the situation on the ground in the Indies between Spanish and Portuguese settlers, although Brazil and Spanish America were administered through separate councils in Spain.

Spain dealt with English encroachment on Spain&#x27;s maritime control in the Indies, particularly by Sir Francis Drake and his cousin John Hawkins. In 1568, the Spanish defeated Hawkins&#x27; fleet at the Battle of San Juan de Ulúa in present-day Mexico. In 1585, Drake sailed for the West Indies and sacked Santo Domingo, captured Cartagena de Indias, and St. Augustine in Florida. Both Drake and Hawkins died of disease during the disastrous 1595–96 expedition against Puerto Rico (Battle of San Juan), Panama, and other targets in the Spanish Main, a severe setback in which the English suffered heavy losses in men and ships.

==== The Philippines, the Sultanate of Brunei and Southeast Asia ====

With the conquest and settlement of the Philippines, the Spanish Empire reached its greatest extent. In 1564, Miguel López de Legazpi was commissioned by the viceroy of New Spain (Mexico), Don Luís de Velasco, to lead an expedition in the Pacific Ocean to find the Spice Islands, where earlier explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Ruy López de Villalobos had landed in 1521 and 1543, respectively. The westward sailing to reach the sources of spices continued to be a necessity with the Ottomans still controlled major choke points in central Asia. It was unclear how the agreement between Spain and Portugal dividing the Atlantic world affected finds on the other side of the Pacific. Spain had ceded its rights to the &quot;Spice Islands&quot; to Portugal in the Treaty of Saragossa in 1529, but the appellation was vague as was their exact delineation. The Legazpi expedition was ordered by King Philip II, after whom the Philippines had earlier been named by Ruy López de Villalobos, when Philip was heir to the throne. The King stated that &quot;the main purpose of this expedition is to establish the return route from the western isles, since it is already known that the route to them is fairly short.&quot; The Viceroy died in July 1564, but the Audiencia and de Legazpi completed the preparations for the expedition. On embarking on the expedition, Spain lacked maps or information to guide the King&#x27;s decision to authorize the expedition. That realization subsequently led to the creation of reports from the various regions of the empire, the relaciones geográficas. The Philippines came under the jurisdiction of the viceroyalty of Mexico, and once the Manila Galleon sailings between Manila and Acapulco were established, Mexico became the Philippines&#x27; link to the larger Spanish Empire.

Spanish colonization began in earnest when López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first settlements in Cebu. Beginning with just five ships and five hundred men accompanied by Augustinian friars, and further strengthened in 1567 by two hundred soldiers, he was able to repel the Portuguese and create the foundations for the colonization of the archipelago. In 1571, the Spanish, their Mexican recruits and their Filipino (Visayan) allies attacked and occupied Maynila, a vassal-state of the Sultanate of Brunei, and negotiated the incorporation of the Kingdom of Tondo which was liberated from the Bruneian Sultanate&#x27;s control and of whom, their princess, Kandarapa, had a tragic romance with the Mexican-born Conquistador and grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, Juan de Salcedo. The combined Spanish-Mexican-Filipino forces also built a Christian walled city over the burnt ruins of Muslim Maynila and made it as the new capital of the Spanish East Indies and renamed it Manila. Spaniards were few and life was difficult and they were often outnumbered by their Amerindian recruits and Filipino allies. They attempted to mobilize subordinated populations through the encomienda. Unlike in the Caribbean where the indigenous populations rapidly disappeared, the indigenous populations continued to be robust in the Philippines. One Spaniard described the climate as &quot;cuatro meses de polvo, cuatro meses de lodo, y cuatro meses de todo&quot; (four months of dust, four months of mud, and four months of everything).

Legazpi built a fort in Manila and made overtures of friendship to Lakan Dula, Lakan of Tondo, who accepted. Maynila&#x27;s former ruler, the Muslim rajah, Rajah Sulayman, who was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei, refused to submit to Legazpi but failed to get the support of Lakan Dula or of the Pampangan and Pangasinan settlements to the north. When Tarik Sulayman and a force of Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslim warriors attacked the Spaniards in the Battle of Bangkusay, he was finally defeated and killed. The Spanish also repelled an attack by Chinese pirate warlord Limahong.

Simultaneously, the establishment of a Christianized Philippines attracted Chinese traders who exchanged their silk for Mexican silver. Indian and Malay traders also settled in the Philippines too, to trade their spices and gems for the same Mexican silver. The Philippines then became a center for Christian missionary activity that was also directed to Japan. The Philippines even accepted Christian converts from Japan after they were persecuted. Most of the soldiers and settlers sent by the Spanish to the Philippines were either from Mexico or Peru and very little people directly came from Spain. At one point, the royal officials in Manila complained that most of the soldiers who were being sent from New Spain were black, mulatto or Native American, with almost no Spaniards among the contingents.

In 1578, the Castilian War erupted between the Christian Spaniards and Muslim Bruneians over control of the Philippine archipelago. The Spanish were joined by the newly Christianized Non-Muslim Visayans of the Kedatuan of Madja-as who were Animists and Rajahnate of Cebu who were Hindus, plus the Rajahnate of Butuan (who were from northern Mindanao and were Hindus with a Buddhist Monarchy), as well as the remnants of the Kedatuan of Dapitan who were also Animists and had previously waged war against the Islamic nations of the Sultanate of Sulu and Kingdom of Maynila. They fought against the Sultanate of Brunei and its allies, the Bruneian puppet-states of Maynila and Sulu, which had dynastic links with Brunei. The Spanish, its Mexican recruits and Filipino allies assaulted Brunei and seized its capital, Kota Batu. This was achieved partly as a result of the assistance of two noblemen, Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had traveled to Manila to offer Brunei as a tributary of Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would indeed become the Sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new Bendahara. In March 1578, the Spanish fleet, led by Francisco de Sande himself, acting as Capitán General, started its journey towards Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards and Mexicans, 1,500 Filipino natives and 300 Borneans. The campaign was one of many, which also included action in Mindanao and Sulu.

The Spanish succeeded in invading the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to Jerudong. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. The Spanish suffered heavy losses due to a cholera or dysentery outbreak. They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei to return to Manila on 26 June 1578, after just 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof.

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August–September 1578, probably from the same illness that had afflicted his Spanish allies, although there was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling Sultan. Seri Lela&#x27;s daughter, the Bruneian princess, left with the Spanish and went on to marry a Christian Tagalog, named Agustín de Legazpi of Tondo, and had children in the Philippines.

In 1587, Magat Salamat, one of the children of Lakan Dula, along with Lakan Dula&#x27;s nephew and lords of the neighboring areas of Tondo, Pandacan, Marikina, Candaba, Navotas and Bulacan, were executed when the Tondo Conspiracy of 1587–1588 failed. a planned grand alliance with the Japanese Christian-captain, Gayo, and Brunei&#x27;s Sultan, would have restored the old aristocracy. Its failure resulted in the hanging of Agustín de Legaspi and the execution of Magat Salamat (the crown-prince of Tondo). Thereafter, some of the conspirators were exiled to Guam or Guerrero, Mexico.

The Spanish then conducted the centuries long Spanish–Moro conflict against the Sultanates of Maguindanao, Lanao and Sulu. War was also waged against the Sultanate of Ternate and Tidore, in response to Ternatean slaving and piracy against Spain&#x27;s allies: Bohol and Butuan. During the Spanish–Moro conflict, the Moros of Muslim Mindanao conducted piracy and slave-raids against Christian settlements in the Philippines. The Spanish fought back by establishing Christian fort-cities such as Zamboanga City on Muslim Mindanao. The Spanish considered their war with the Muslims in Southeast Asia an extension of the Reconquista, a centuries-long campaign to retake and rechristianize the Spanish homeland which was invaded by the Muslims of the Umayyad Caliphate. The Spanish expeditions into the Philippines were also part of a larger Ibero-Islamic world conflict that included a rivalry with the Ottoman Caliphate, which had a center of operations at its nearby vassal, the Sultanate of Aceh.

In 1593, the governor-general of the Philippines, Luis Pérez Dasmariñas, set out to conquer Cambodia, igniting the Cambodian–Spanish War. Some 120 Spaniards, Japanese, and Filipinos, sailing aboard three junks, launched an expedition to Cambodia. After an altercation between the Spanish expedition members and some Chinese merchants at the port left a few Chinese dead, the Spanish were forced to confront the newly declared king, Anacaparan, burning much of his capital while defeating him. In 1599, Malay Muslim merchants defeated and massacred almost the entire contingent of Spanish troops in Cambodia, putting an end to Spanish plans to conquer it. Another expedition, one to conquer Mindanao, was also lacking in success. In 1603, during a Chinese rebellion, Pérez Dasmariñas was beheaded, and his head was mounted in Manila along with those of several other Spanish soldiers.

=== Portugal and the Iberian Union 1580–1640 ===
Despite the fact that during the Iberian Union a certain degree of autonomy and the cultural identity of Portugal was maintained, many historians agree that the dynastic union was in fact a Spanish conquest by keeping Portugal and the Portuguese Empire as part of the Spanish colonial empire under the sovereignty of Philip II of Spain and his successors after the Spanish victory in the War of Portuguese Succession.

In 1580, King Philip saw the opportunity to strengthen his position in Iberia when the last member of the Portuguese royal family, Henry, King of Portugal, died. Philip asserted his claim to the Portuguese throne and in June sent Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba with an army to Lisbon to assure his succession. Philip famously remarked upon his acquisition of the Portuguese throne: &quot;I inherited, I bought, I conquered,&quot; a variation on Julius Caesar and Veni, Vidi, Vici. Spanish forces led by Admiral Álvaro de Bazán captured the Azores Islands in 1583, completing the incorporation of Portugal into the Spanish Empire. Thus, Philip added to his possessions a vast colonial empire in Africa, Brazil, and the East Indies, seeing a flood of new revenues coming to the Habsburg crown. The success of colonization all around his empire improved his financial position, enabling him to show greater aggression towards his enemies. The English Armada of 1589 failed to liberate Portugal.

Philip established the Council of Portugal, on the pattern of the royal councils; the Council of Castile, Council of Aragon, and Council of the Indies, that oversaw particular jurisdictions, but all under the same monarch. As a result of the Iberian Union, Phillip II&#x27;s enemies became Portugal&#x27;s enemies, such as the Dutch in the Dutch–Portuguese War, England or France. War with the Dutch led to invasions of many countries in Asia, including Ceylon and commercial interests in Japan, Africa (Mina), and South America. During the reign of Philip IV (Philip III of Portugal) in 1640, the Portuguese revolted and fought successfully for their independence from the rest of Iberia, although Spain continued to attempt to crush the revolt until 1668. The Council of Portugal was subsequently dissolved.

===Philip III===

Philip III succeeded his father in 1598 but had no interest in politics or government, preferring to engage in lavish court festivities, religious indulgences, and the theatre. He needed someone to do the work of governing, and he settled on Francisco Gómez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma.

Under the guidance of Lerma, Philip III&#x27;s government resorted to a tactic that had been resolutely resisted by Philip II, paying for the budget deficits by the mass minting of increasingly worthless vellones, causing inflation. In 1607, the government faced bankruptcy.

Peace with France in 1598 and England in 1604 meant that Spain could focus her energies on restoring her rule to the Dutch provinces. The Dutch, led by Maurice of Nassau, the son of William the Silent, had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of Breda. Following the peace with England, the new Spanish commander Ambrogio Spinola pressed hard against the Dutch. Spinola, a general of abilities to match Maurice, was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain&#x27;s renewed bankruptcy in 1607. Fortunately, Spanish forces had regained enough of the military initiative to convince a politically divided United Provinces to sign a Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in 1609.

Spain recovered during the truce, ordering her finances and doing much to restore her prestige and stability in the run-up to the last war in which she would participate as the leading power. In the Spanish Netherlands, the rule of Philip II&#x27;s daughter, Isabella Clara Eugenia, and her husband, Archduke Albert, restored stability. But Philip III and Lerma lacked the ability to make any meaningful change in the country&#x27;s foreign policy. They clung to the idea of placing the Infanta Isabella on the English throne after Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s death and sent a limited expeditionary force to Ireland to aid the Spanish-supplied rebels. The English defeated it, but the long war of attrition there had drained England of money, men, and morale: Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, James I, wanted a fresh start to his reign. The war that had been going on between the two countries since 1585 finally ended. War with France threatened in 1610, but shortly after, Henry IV was assassinated, and the regency of the boy king Louis XIII was not stable. Up until 1630, Spain was at peace and continued its dominant position in Europe. Meanwhile, Lerma&#x27;s enemies expelled him from office in 1617, and Baltasar de Zúñiga began calling for a more aggressive foreign policy.

In 1618, beginning with the Defenestration of Prague, Austria and Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, embarked on a campaign against the Protestant Union and Bohemian Revolt. Zúñiga encouraged Philip to join the Austrian Habsburgs in the war, and Ambrogio Spinola, the rising star of the Spanish army, was sent at the head of the Army of Flanders to intervene. Thus, Spain entered into the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

===Philip IV===

In 1621, Philip III died and his son succeeded as Philip IV. The militarists now were firmly in charge. The following year, Zúñiga was replaced by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, an able man who believed that the center of all Spain&#x27;s woes lay in Holland. After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at White Mountain in 1621, and again at Stadtlohn in 1623. The war with the Netherlands was renewed with Spinola taking the fortress of Breda in 1625. The intervention of the Danish king Christian IV in the war worried some, because Christian was one of Europe&#x27;s few monarchs who had no worries over his finances. However, the victory of the Imperial general Albert of Wallenstein over the Danes at Dessau Bridge and again at Lutter, both in 1626, eliminated the threat. There was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed subdued. France was once again involved in her own instabilities and the famous Siege of La Rochelle began in 1627. Spain&#x27;s eminence seemed irrefutable. The Count-Duke Olivares stridently affirmed &quot;God is Spanish and fights for our nation these days.&quot;

Olivares was a man out of his time. He realized that Spain needed to reform and to reform it needed peace. The destruction of the United Provinces of the Netherlands was necessary. Dutch colonial policy tried to undermine Spanish and Portuguese hegemony. Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, and the war seemed to be going in Spain&#x27;s favor.

In 1627, the Castilian economy collapsed. The Spanish had been debasing their currency to pay for the war and prices exploded in Spain just as they had in previous years in Austria. Until 1631, parts of Castile operated on a barter economy as a result of the currency crisis, and the government was unable to collect any meaningful taxes from the peasantry, depending instead on its colonies (via the Spanish treasure fleet). The Spanish armies in Germany resorted to &quot;paying themselves&quot; on the land. Olivares, who had backed certain tax measures in Spain pending the completion of the war, was further blamed for the fruitless War of the Mantuan Succession in Italy. The Dutch, who during the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce had made their navy a priority, proceeded to plunder Spanish and (especially) Portuguese maritime trade, on which Spain was wholly dependent after the economic collapse. Spanish victories in Germany and Italy were not enough to matter, and their navy began suffering losses.

In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden landed in Germany and relieved the port of Stralsund that was the last stronghold on the continent held by German forces belligerent to the Emperor. Gustav then marched south winning notable victories at Breitenfeld and Lutzen, attracting greater support for the Protestant cause the further he went. The situation for the Catholics improved with Gustav&#x27;s death at Lutzen in 1632 and a shocking victory for Imperial forces under Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and Ferdinand III of Hungary at Nordlingen in 1634. From a position of strength, the Emperor approached the war-weary German states with a peace in 1635. Many accepted, including the two most powerful, Brandenburg-Prussia and Saxony.

Cardinal Richelieu had been a strong supporter of the Dutch and Protestants since the beginning of the war, sending funds and equipment in an attempt to stem Habsburg strength in Europe. Richelieu decided that the recently signed Peace of Prague was contrary to French interests and declared war on the Holy Roman Emperor and Spain within months of the peace being signed. The more experienced Spanish forces scored initial successes. Olivares ordered a lightning campaign into northern France from the Spanish Netherlands, hoping to shatter the resolve of King Louis XIII&#x27;s ministers and topple Richelieu before the war exhausted Spanish finances and France&#x27;s military resources could be fully deployed. In the &quot;année de Corbie&quot;, 1636, Spanish forces advanced as far south as Amiens and Corbie, threatening Paris and quite nearly ending the war on their terms.

After 1636, however, Olivares stopped the advance. The French thus gained time to properly mobilise. At the Battle of the Downs in 1639 a Spanish fleet was destroyed by the Dutch States Navy, and the Spanish found themselves unable to adequately reinforce and supply their forces in the Netherlands. The Spanish Army of Flanders, which represented the finest of Spanish soldiery and leadership, faced a French advance led by Louis, Grand Condé in northern France at Rocroi in 1643. The Spanish, led by Francisco de Melo, were routed. One of Spain&#x27;s best and most famous armies had suffered defeat on the battlefield and the waning power of Spain was eclipsed by that of France.

=== The last Spanish Habsburgs (1643–1700) ===

Burdened by wartime taxes and supported by the French, the Catalans, Portuguese and Neapolitans rose up in revolt against the Spanish in the 1640s. With the Spanish Netherlands now very much on the defensive between French and Dutch forces after the Battle of Lens in 1648, the Spanish made peace with the Dutch and recognized the independent United Provinces in the Peace of Westphalia that ended both the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Olivares attempted to suppress the Catalan Revolt by launching an invasion of southern France. The quartering of Spanish troops in the Principality of Catalonia only made the situation worse. The Catalans decided to secede from Spain altogether and unite with France. French troops soon arrived in Catalonia, but when a renewed civil war (The Fronde) broke out at home, their domestically distracted forces were driven out in 1652 by Catalan and Spanish Habsburg forces.

England now entered the war and occupied Jamaica. The long, desultory and weary struggle effectively ended at the Battle of the Dunes (1658) where the French army under Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne (along with some English help) defeated the Spanish Army of Flanders. Spain agreed to the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 that ceded to France Artois, Roussillon, and portions of Lorraine.

Meanwhile, the Portuguese took advantage of the Catalan revolt to declare their own independence in 1640. The 60 years of union between Portugal and Spain were not happy. The Portuguese fluent Philip II visited the country twice, but Philip III only once, in a short formal visit. Philip IV never bothered to. The Spanish, hard pressed elsewhere, were blamed for inadequately protecting Portugal&#x27;s overseas colonies from the Dutch who annexed parts of Colonial Brazil. In a time of economic downturn, the Spanish colonies did not enjoy having to trade and compete with their Portuguese counterparts. Moreover, Portugal&#x27;s autonomous status as an equal in the union went into decline after Philip II and was treated increasingly in the great councils of state as a province. After Portugal declared independence and chose the Duke of Braganza as King John IV, Spain was distracted with a revolt in Andalusia and thus was unable to do anything about it.

The Portuguese Revolt was partially what led Spain to conclude peace with France in 1659. But the government had gone bankrupt again in 1647 and 1653, and the nobility would not give an inch on financial and tax reforms. Portuguese victories in 1663 at Ameixial and in 1665 at Montes Claros secured their independence. Spain finally recognized Portugal&#x27;s sovereignty in the Treaty of Lisbon (1668).

Philip IV, who had seen over the course of his life the declining influence of Spain&#x27;s empire, sank slowly into depression after he had to dismiss his favorite courtier, Olivares, in 1643. In 1646, his eldest son and heir Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias died at the age of 16. Charles II suffered from generations of Habsburg inbreeding and was physically and mentally incapable of governing, being manipulated by various political factions throughout his life. For a short time under Don Juan José de Austria, illegitimate son of Philip IV, as valido the nobility came to dominate Spain once again. Most were self-serving, but there were a few such as Manuel Joaquín Álvarez de Toledo, Count of Oropesa, who managed to stabilize the currency, despite ruinous deflation. Others tried to weaken the power of the Spanish Inquisition, which however was not abolished until 1808, and encourage economic development.

Even so, Spain&#x27;s economy declined, especially in Castile, and its population decreased by nearly two million people during the 17th century. This was partially due to plague outbreaks, and partially due to the huge casualties caused by almost continuous warfare. The period 1677–1686 was a low point, with famine, plague, natural disasters, and economic upheaval. Emigration to the New World increased.

France was now strong and united under Louis XIV and after the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) took Spain&#x27;s place as the dominant power in Europe. Three wars were fought during this period, the War of Devolution (1667–1668), the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678), and the War of the Grand Alliance (1688–1697). Although Spain&#x27;s territorial losses (the Franche-Comté, some towns in the Southern Netherlands and part of the island of Hispaniola) were relatively few, it had demonstrated some vulnerability. Louis XIV and other European rulers had plans for when Charles II&#x27;s death came, as it was clear that he would produce no children and the Habsburg line in Spain would die with him. The end came with Charles&#x27; passing at the age of 39 on November 1, 1700.

== Religion and the Spanish Inquisition ==
The Spanish Inquisition was formally launched during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, continued by their Habsburg successors, and only ended in the 19th century. Under Charles I, the Inquisition became a formal department in the Spanish government, hurtling out of control as the 16th century progressed.

Philip II greatly expanded the Inquisition and made church orthodoxy a goal of public policy. In 1559, three years after Philip came to power, students in Spain were forbidden to travel abroad, the leaders of the Inquisition were placed in charge of censorship, and books could no longer be imported. Philip vigorously tried to excise Protestantism from Spain, holding innumerable campaigns to eliminate Lutheran and Calvinist literature from the country, hoping to avoid the chaos taking place in France.

Philip was more religious than his father, and was convinced that if the Protestants were resorting to military force, then he must do likewise. He was willing to do whatever it took to fight the heretics and preserve Spanish hegemony, even intervening in papal conclaves to ensure the choosing of a pro-Spanish pope. Philip succeeded three times with popes Urban VII, Gregory XIV, and Innocent IX. But the fourth time, he failed to prevent the election of the pro-French Clement VIII.

The Catholic Church in Spain had been purged of many of its administrative excesses in the 15th century by Cardinal Francisco Ximénez de Cisneros. The Inquisition served to expurgate many of the more radical reformers who sought to change church theology as the Protestant reformers wanted. Instead, Spain became the scion of the Counter-Reformation as it emerged from the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. Spain bred two unique threads of counter-reformationary thought in the persons of Saint Theresa of Avila and the Basque Ignatius Loyola. Theresa advocated strict monasticism and a revival of more ancient traditions of penitence. She experienced a mystical ecstasy that became profoundly influential on Spanish culture and art. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit Order, was influential across the world in his stress on spiritual and mental excellence and contributed to a resurgence of learning across Europe. In 1625, a peak of Spanish prestige and power, the Count-Duke of Olivares established the Jesuit Colegio Imperial de Madrid to train Spanish nobles in the humanities and military arts.

The Moriscos of southern Spain had been forcibly converted to Christianity in 1502, but under the rule of Charles I they had been able to obtain a degree of tolerance from their Christian rulers. They were allowed to practice their former custom, dress, and language, and religious laws were laxly enforced. However, Charles also passed the &quot;Limpieza de sangre&quot;, a law that excluded those not of pure Old Christian, non-Jewish blood from public office. Philip began to put back into place the restrictive laws of generations before and in 1568 the Moriscos rebelled. The revolt was only put down by Italian troops under Don John of Austria. Even then the Moriscos retreated to the highlands and were not defeated until 1570. The revolt was followed by a massive resettlement program in which 12,000 Christian peasants replaced the Moriscos. In 1609, on the advice of the Duke of Lerma, Philip III expelled the 300,000 Moriscos of Spain.

The expulsion of the industrious Jews, Moors, and Moriscos did nothing to advance the Spanish economy. The small scattered groups of Moriscos lived largely by subsistence farming in marginal mountain areas or by unskilled laboring in a country that had very many underemployed hands. A council set up to investigate the matter in Castile found little effect, but in parts of Aragon and especially the Kingdom of Valencia, where half the Moriscos had lived, and had made up a substantial minority of the population, the impact was certainly noticeable for the noblemen who had lost rents.

== Administration and bureaucracy ==
The Spanish received a large influx of gold from the colonies in the New World as plunder when they were conquered, much of which Charles I used to prosecute his wars in Europe. In the 1520s silver began to be extracted from the rich deposits at Guanajuato, but it was not until the 1540s, with the opening of the mines at Potosí and Zacatecas, that silver was to become the fabled source of wealth it has assumed in legend. The Spanish left mining to private enterprise but instituted a tax known as the &quot;Royal fifth&quot; whereby a fifth of the metal was collected by the government. They were quite successful in enforcing the tax throughout their vast empire in the New World. All bullion had to pass through the House of Trade in Seville, under the direction of the Council of the Indies. The supply of Almadén mercury, vital to extracting silver from the ore, was controlled by the state and contributed to the rigor of Spanish tax policy.

Inflation, both in Spain and in the rest of Europe, was primarily caused by debt, but a level of debt made possible later by the rising silver imports. Charles had conducted most of his wars on credit. In 1557, a year after he abdicated, Spain was forced into its first debt moratorium, setting a pattern that would be repeated with ever more disruptive economic consequences.

Few Spaniards initially gave a thought to the wholesale slaughter, enslavement, and forced conversion of Native Americans either, although some men such as Bartolomé de las Casas argued for more humane treatment of them. This led to much debate and governmental action. The Laws of Burgos, the New Laws, and other legal and institutional changes somewhat alleviated conditions for Native Americans, including the freeing of all Native American slaves.

Faced with the growing threat of piracy, in 1564 the Spanish adopted a convoy system far ahead of its time, with treasure fleets leaving America in April and August. The policy proved efficient, and was quite successful. Only two convoys were captured: one in 1628 when it was captured by the Dutch, and another in 1656, captured by the English, but by then the convoys were a shadow of what they had been at their peak at the end of the previous century. Nevertheless, even without being completely captured they frequently came under attack, which inevitably took its toll. Not all shipping of the dispersed empire could be protected by large convoys, allowing the Dutch, English and French privateers and pirates the opportunity to attack trade along the American and Spanish coastlines and raid isolated settlements. This became particularly savage from the 1650s, with all sides falling to extraordinary levels of barbarity, even by the harsh standards of the time. Spain also responded with no small amount of privateering, using the recaptured city of Dunkirk as a base for its Dunkirk Raiders to molest Dutch, English and French trade. More seriously, the Portuguese part of the empire, with its chronically undermanned African and Asian forts, proved nearly impossible to defend adequately, and with Spain so fully engaged on so many fronts, it could spare little for their defense. Spain also had to deal with Ottoman backed Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean, a vastly greater menace than Caribbean piracy, as well as Oriental and Dutch piracy in the waters around the Philippines.

The growth of Spain&#x27;s empire in the New World was accomplished from Seville, without the close direction of the leadership in Madrid. Charles I and Philip II were primarily concerned with their duties in Europe, and thus control of the Americas was handled by viceroys and colonial administrators who operated with virtual autonomy. The Habsburg kings regarded their colonies as feudal associations rather than integral parts of Spain. No Spanish king ever visited the new world. The Habsburgs, whose family had traditionally ruled over diverse, non-contiguous domains and had been forced to devolve autonomy to local administrators, replicated and continued those feudal policies in Spain, with the Basques, the Crown of Aragon and each of its constituent kingdoms retaining their Fuero rights.

This meant that taxes, infrastructure improvement, and internal trade policy were defined independently by each territory, leading to many internal customs barriers and tolls, and conflicting policies even within the Habsburg domains. Charles I and Philip II had been able to master the various courts through their impressive political energy, but the much weaker Philip III and IV allowed it to decay. At the end, Charles II was incapable of controlling anything at all. The development of Spain itself was hampered by the fact that Charles I and Philip II spent most of their time abroad. For most of the 16th century, Spain was administered from Brussels and Antwerp. It was only during the Dutch Revolt that Philip returned to Spain, where he spent most of his time in the seclusion of the monastic palace of El Escorial. The empire, held together by a determined king keeping the bureaucracy together, experienced a setback when a less-trusting ruler came to the throne. Philip II distrusted the nobility and discouraged any independent initiative among them. While writers of the time offered novel solutions to Spain&#x27;s problems such as using irrigation in agriculture and encouragement of economic activity, the nobility never really produced anyone that could bring about serious reforms.

Charles I, on becoming king, clashed with his nobles during the Castilian War of the Communities when he attempted to fill government positions with effective Dutch and Flemish officials. Philip II encountered major resistance when he tried to enforce his authority over the Netherlands, contributing to the rebellion in that country. The Count-Duke of Olivares, Philip IV&#x27;s chief minister, always regarded it as essential to Spain&#x27;s survival that the bureaucracy be centralized. He even backed the full union of Portugal with Spain, though he never had an opportunity to realize his ideas. The bureaucracy became so increasingly bloated and corrupt that by the time of Olivares&#x27;s dismissal in 1643, its deterioration had rendered it largely ineffective.

== Economy ==
Like most of Europe, Spain had suffered from famine and plague during the 14th and 15th centuries. By 1500, Europe was beginning to emerge from these demographic disasters, and populations began to explode. Seville, which was home to 60,000 people in 1500 burgeoned to 150,000 by the end of the century. There was a substantial movement to the cities of Spain to capitalize on new opportunities as shipbuilders and merchants to service Spain&#x27;s impressive and growing empire. The 16th century was a time of development in Spain as both agriculture and trade burgeoned. Throughout the harsh interior of Castile grain and wool production grew. The former fed an expansion of the population. The latter fed both local textile manufacturing and a lucrative trade with the Netherlands. The Castilian cities of Burgos, Segovia, Cuenca and Toledo, flourished with the expansion of the textile and metallurgical industries. Santander, on the northern Atlantic coast, grew in wealth from its traditional roles as a port linking the country&#x27;s interior with Northern Europe and as a ship building centre. Southern cities like Cádiz and Seville expanded rapidly from the commerce and shipbuilding spurred on by the demands of the American colonies and enjoyed a monopoly on trade with Spanish America. Barcelona, already one of Europe&#x27;s most important and sophisticated trading port cities in the Middle Ages, continued to develop. By 1590, Spain&#x27;s population was far greater than what it had been in any previous period. It was during this last decade when Castile began to suffer crop failures and was struck by a plague from 1596 that brought about the first serious reversal in population numbers, a cycle that would repeat itself a number of times in different parts of the country through the 17th century.

As the 16th century had worn on, inflation in Spain triggered hardship for the peasantry. it was a result of state debt and, more importantly, the importation of silver and gold from the New World. The average cost of goods quintupled in the 16th century in Spain, led by wool and grain. While reasonable when compared to the 20th century, prices in the 15th century changed very little, and the European economy was shaken by the so-called price revolution. Spain, which along with England was Europe&#x27;s only producer of wool, initially benefited from the rapid growth. However, like in England, there began in Spain an inclosure movement that stifled the growth of food and depopulated whole villages whose residents were forced to move to cities. The higher inflation, the burden of the Habsburgs&#x27; wars and the many customs duties dividing the country and restricting trade with the Americas, stifled the growth of industry that may have provided an alternative source of income in the towns. Another factor was the militaristic nature of the Castilian nobility, which had developed during the centuries of the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula. They preferred careers in the government bureaucracy, the military, or the church, shunning economic activities. This militarism also meant that Spain exhausted its wealth and manpower in near-continuous wars. Under Philip II, these wars had much to do with combating Protestantism, but in the 17th century it became clear that the world that had existed before 1517 could not be restored. Spain&#x27;s wars during that century became increasingly more to do with preserving the hegemonic power of the Habsburg alliance in Europe. Although the Habsburg alliance was successful in buttressing the Catholic Church against the rise of Protestantism.

Sheep-farming was practiced extensively in Castile, and grew rapidly with rising wool prices with the backing of the king. Merino sheep were annually moved from the mountains of the north to the warmer south every winter, ignoring state-mandated trails that were intended to prevent the sheep from trampling the farmland. Complaints lodged against the shepherds&#x27; guild, the &quot;Mesta&quot;, were ignored by Philip II who received a great deal of revenue from wool. Eventually, overtaxed Castile became barren, and Spain, particularly Castile, became dependent on large imports of grain to make up for crop shortfalls. That, given the cost of transportation and the risk of piracy, made staples far more expensive in Spain than elsewhere. As a result, Spain&#x27;s population, and especially Castile&#x27;s, never dense on the generally very dry, rocky, mountainous peninsula, grew much more slowly than France&#x27;s. By Louis XIV&#x27;s time (1661–1715), France had a population greater than that of Spain and England combined.

Credit emerged as a widespread tool of Spanish business in the 17th century. The city of Antwerp, in the Spanish Netherlands, lay at the heart of European commerce and its bankers financed most of Charles V&#x27;s and Philip II&#x27;s wars on credit. The use of &quot;notes of exchange&quot; became common as Antwerp&#x27;s banks became increasingly powerful and led to extensive speculation that helped to exaggerate price shifts. Although these trends laid the foundation for the development of capitalism in Spain and Europe as a whole, the total lack of regulation and pervasive corruption meant that small landowners often lost everything with a single stroke of misfortune. Estates in Spain, and especially in Castile, grew progressively larger and the economy became increasingly uncompetitive, particularly during the reigns of Philip III and IV when repeated speculative crises shook Spain.

Since the medieval period the Catholic Church had always been important to the Spanish economy. This importance increased greatly in the reigns of Philip III and IV, who had bouts of intense personal piety and church philanthropy, donating large areas of the country to the Church. The later Habsburgs did nothing to promote the redistribution of land. By the end of Charles II&#x27;s reign, most of Castile was in the hands of a select few landowners, the largest of which by far was the Church. It has been estimated that at the end of the 17th century the holdings of the Spanish church had expanded to include nearly 20% of Castilian land and that the clergy made up as much as 10% of adult males in Castile. Government policy under the succeeding Bourbon dynasty was directed to steadily reducing the Church&#x27;s vast holdings, which by then had come to be seen as an impediment to the country&#x27;s development.

== Art and culture ==

The Spanish Golden Age was a flourishing period of arts and letters in Spain which spanned roughly from 1550 to 1650. Some of the outstanding figures of the period were El Greco, Diego Velázquez, Miguel de Cervantes and Pedro Calderón de la Barca.

El Greco was a Greek painter whose dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. Velázquez&#x27;s work became a model for 19th century realist and impressionist painters.

Cervantes and de la Barca were both writers. &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;, by Cervantes, is one of the most famous works of the period and probably the best-known piece of Spanish literature of all time. It is a parody of the romantic, chivalric aspects of knighthood and a criticism of contemporary social structures and societal norms. Juana Inés de la Cruz, the last great writer of this golden age, died in New Spain in 1695.

This period also saw a flourishing in intellectual activity, now known as the School of Salamanca, producing thinkers that were studied throughout Europe.

<text>The Working Families Party (WFP) is a progressive minor political party in the United States, founded in New York in 1998. There are active chapters in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

The Working Families Party of New York was first organized in 1998 by a coalition of labor unions, community organizations, members of the now-inactive national New Party, and a variety of advocacy groups such as Citizen Action of New York and ACORN: the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. The party is primarily concerned with healthcare reform, raising the minimum wage, universal paid sick days, addressing student debt, progressive taxation, public education, energy, and environmental reform.

==History==
Dan Cantor, the labor coordinator for Jesse Jackson&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign, and Joel Rogers wrote &quot;Party Time&quot; in which they called for a &quot;party within the party&quot;. Cantor and Rogers formed the New Party in 1990, and planned on taking advantage of electoral fusion. The party started running candidates, but was losing support by 1997. Cantor, staff from the New Party, Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, and others formed the Working Families Party in 1998. Bill de Blasio, the future mayor of New York City and friend of Cantor, was present for the party&#x27;s foundation.

The Connecticut Working Families Party was formed in 2002, by organizations that included ACORN, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Communications Workers of America, and United Food and Commercial Workers.

In 2010, the party recruited and trained thirteen candidates for seats on the New York City Council in the 2013 election. Twelve of these candidates won.

==Ideology==
WFP follows the ideals of progressive politics, describing itself as a &quot;grass roots independent political organization&quot;. The WFP has been referred to by some as the Tea Party movement of the left.

==Electoral strategy==
Like other minor parties in the state, the WFP benefits from New York&#x27;s electoral fusion laws that allow the party to support another party&#x27;s candidate.

In some cases, the WFP has put forward its own candidates. In the chaotic situation following the 2003 assassination of New York City councilman James E. Davis by political rival Othniel Askew, the slain councilman&#x27;s brother Geoffrey Davis was chosen to succeed him in the Democratic primary. As it became clear that Geoffrey Davis lacked his late brother&#x27;s political experience, fellow Democrat Letitia James decided to challenge him in the general election on the WFP ticket and won Brooklyn&#x27;s 35th City Council district as the first third-party candidate elected there in 30 years. Despite this success, James switched back to the Democratic Party when she ran successfully for re-election in 2008.

Some of the party&#x27;s endorsed candidates include Connecticut governor Dan Malloy, U.S. representative Jesús &quot;Chuy&quot; García, US senators Chris Murphy (CT) and Jeff Merkley (OR), former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, and New York attorney general Letitia James, and Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson.

In 2006, the party began ballot access drives in California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, and South Carolina.

Edwin Gomes, running in a February 2015 special election for the Connecticut State Senate, became the first candidate in the nation to win a state legislative office running solely as a nominee for the Working Families Party.

In 2015, the New York WFP ran 111 of its candidates, winning 71 local offices. That same year, the WFP endorsed Bernie Sanders in his campaign for U.S. president, its first national endorsement. In 2016, after Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee, the WFP endorsed her for president.

In 2017, Joshua M. Hall, running in an April 2017 special election for the Connecticut House of Representatives, became the second candidate in the nation to win a state legislative office running solely as a nominee for the Working Families Party.

In 2019, the WFP endorsed Elizabeth Warren in her campaign for president of the United States. Warren won the endorsement with 60.91% of the vote, compared with 35.82% for runner-up Bernie Sanders. The WFP received some criticism for not releasing the individual vote tallies between the party leadership and membership base, each of which accounts for 50% of the vote. In the 2016 primary the WFP had endorsed Sanders, one of Warren&#x27;s opponents in the 2020 primary. After Warren dropped out of the race, the WFP endorsed Sanders.

== National presence ==
Since 2019, the WFP has recruited major progressive elected officials to deliver a response to the State of the Union address by the president of the United States, as is customary for the opposition party of the President. The following elected officials delivered a response to the State of the Union, beginning in 2019 with a response to then-President Donald Trump:
* 2019: Mandela Barnes, 45th lieutenant governor of Wisconsin
* 2020: Ayanna Pressley, U.S. representative from MA-07
* 2021: Jamaal Bowman, U.S. representative from NY-16
* 2022: Rashida Tlaib, U.S. representative from MI-13
* 2023: Delia Ramirez, U.S. representative from IL-03
* 2024: Nicolas O&#x27;Rourke, Minority Whip of the Philadelphia City Council

==Campaigns==

===1990s===
In the 1998 election for governor of New York, the party cross-endorsed the Democratic Party candidate, Peter Vallone. Because he received more than 50,000 votes on the WFP line, the party gained an automatic ballot line for the succeeding four years. The WFP endorsed Chuck Schumer&#x27;s original 1998 New York Senate campaign against Republican incumbent Al D&#x27;Amato, who Schumer successfully defeated in the 1998 election.

===2000s===
====2000====
Patricia Eddington of the WFP was elected to the New York State Assembly. In the 2002 election, the Liberal Party, running Andrew Cuomo (who had withdrawn from the Democratic primary), and the Green Party, running academic Stanley Aronowitz, failed to reach that threshold and lost the ballot lines they had previously won. This left the WFP as the only left-progressive minor party with a ballot line.

====2003====
In the chaotic situation that followed the 2003 assassination of New York City councilman James E. Davis by political rival Othniel Askew, the slain councilman&#x27;s brother Geoffrey Davis was chosen to succeed him in the Democratic primary in Brooklyn&#x27;s 35th City Council district. As it became clear that Geoffrey Davis lacked his late brother&#x27;s political experience, fellow Democrat Letitia James decided to challenge him in the general election. James prevailed, becoming the first third-party candidate elected solely on the WFP line.

====2006====
In 2006, the party began ballot access drives in California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, and South Carolina.

In South Carolina, the WFP cross-endorsed Democratic party congressional nominees Randy Maatta (District 1) and Lee Ballenger (District 3). In the SC State House elections, the WFP cross-endorsed Democratic Party candidates Anton Gunn (Kershaw, Richland) and Eugene Platt (Charleston).

====2007====
The WFP elected two party members to the city council of Hartford, Connecticut.

====2008====
The South Carolina Working Families Party convention endorsed five candidates for state and local office. One candidate, Eugene Platt, running for SC State House District 115, was also nominated by the South Carolina Green Party. The nomination of Michael Cone for the US Senate race, opposing incumbent Lindsey Graham, marked the first time the South Carolina party nominated anyone for statewide office. 

====2009====
Two candidates for the Board of Education in Bridgeport, Connecticut were also WFP-supported members of the board.

In August 2009, various media raised questions about the relationship between the WFP, a non-profit political party, and a for-profit private company called Data and Field Services (DFS). An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; questioned whether DFS may be charging select clients below market rates for political services. In August 2010, the federal investigation into the party ended with no charges being filed, and no charges being referred to other law enforcement agencies.

===2010s===
====2010====
In the same year, the Connecticut WFP endorsed Dannel Malloy for governor. He received 26,308 votes as a Working Families candidate, putting him ahead of his Republican opponent, and securing ballot access for the party in that state.

====2011====
In Connecticut, the WFP won all three minority seats on the city council of Hartford, eliminating Republican representation. As of 2016, the WFP continues to hold all minority seats on the Hartford City Council. In 2011 Connecticut WFP director Jon Green received a $10,000 fine for failing to wear his badge identifying him as a lobbyist while performing lobbying efforts.

====2012====
In Connecticut, the WFP backed Chris Murphy&#x27;s successful race against billionaire Linda McMahon for the US Senate seat that was vacated by Joe Lieberman, supported SEIU/CCAG leader and organizer Christopher Donovan for Connecticut&#x27;s 5th Congressional seat, as well as defeated a ballot initiative in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that would have abolished the elected board of education.

====2014====
After considering Zephyr Teachout, the party re-endorsed Cuomo for New York governor despite some dissatisfaction and frustration with his first term. However, Cuomo resisted the party&#x27;s influence and sabotaged the party electorally. In 2010 more than 150,000 of his votes came on the WFP line. As of November 7, 2014, 120,425 votes came on the WFP line for Cuomo.

====2015====
Edwin Gomes, running in a February 2015 special election for the Connecticut State Senate, became the first candidate in the nation to win a state legislative office running solely as a nominee for the Working Families Party.

On May 5, 2015, Diana Richardson won a special election for a seat in the New York State Assembly, running only on the Working Families ticket.

NY WFP ran 111 candidates in 2015, winning 71 local offices.

In December 2015, the WFP endorsed Bernie Sanders in his 2016 campaign for U.S. president; this was the WFP&#x27;s first national endorsement. In 2016, after Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee, the WFP endorsed her for president.

====2016====
In the fall of 2015, the Working Families Party conducted a combined membership-drive and open poll among its enrolled members on whom to endorse for president in 2016; the result being Bernie Sanders. Official numbers were not disclosed but party spokesman and co-founder Dan Cantor said the results were &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; in favor of Sanders, with some sources stating it was an 87 to 12 to 1 percent vote with Sanders over Hillary Clinton and Martin O&#x27;Malley respectively. The South Carolina Working Families Party cross- endorsed Democratic nominee Dimitri Cherry in his effort to unseat incumbent congressman Mark Sanford in South Carolina&#x27;s 1st Congressional District; Cherry also garnered the endorsement of South Carolina&#x27;s Green Party but lost to Sanford in the general election.

====2017====
In 2017, Joshua M. Hall, running in an April 2017 special election for the Connecticut House of Representatives, became the second candidate in the nation to win a state legislative office running solely as a nominee for the Working Families Party.

On October 3, 2017, a runoff election for Mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, resulted in the election of Randall Woodfin, who had been backed by the Working Families Party.

====2018====
In April 2018 an endorsement of Cynthia Nixon over incumbent Andrew Cuomo in Cuomo&#x27;s bid for a third term as New York governor caused a schism in the party in which labor unions including New York&#x27;s biggest union Service Employees International Union and Communications Workers of America indicated they would not support the party in the election. The withdrawal was believed would significantly hurt the party&#x27;s finances which in 2018 was $1.7 million and statewide staff of about 15 people. The battle received considerable attention since there were concerns that Nixon might have drained enough votes from Cuomo in the general election to allow a Republican to be elected. On October 5, 2018, the WFP cleared Nixon from their ticket on the general election ballot and agreed to endorse Cuomo, who defeated Nixon in the Democratic primary, to preserve their ballot line placement.

While campaigning in the 2018 United States House of Representatives elections in New York, WFP candidate Liuba Grechen Shirley used campaign funds to pay a caregiver for her two young children. The FEC ruled that federal candidates can use campaign funds to pay for child care costs that result from time spent running for office. Grechen Shirley became the first woman in history to receive approval to spend campaign funds on child care.

====2019====
On September 16, 2019, the Working Families Party endorsed Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. In the 2016 primaries the party endorsed Bernie Sanders, one of Warren&#x27;s opponents in the 2020 primary. Some backlash ensued after that decision was made due to the refusal of the WFP to release the vote; they had previously released the vote in 2016. &quot;Jacobin&quot; speculated that Sanders had likely won the party&#x27;s membership vote, which mathematically implied that Warren received 82% to 100% of the leadership vote and only received between 22% and 40% of member support.

On November 5, 2019, the Working Families Party candidate Kendra Brooks won an at-large seat on Philadelphia City Council. The City Council reserves two seats for a minority party, and this is the first time one of those seats went to a candidate not on the Democrat or Republican line in forty years.

===2020s===

====2020====

On March 9, 2020, after Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, the Working Families Party endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. They endorsed Joe Biden on August 13, 2020, during the run-up to the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

====2021====

The Working Families Party initially gave a ranked endorsement for the 2021 New York City Democratic mayoral primary, members voted to rank Scott Stringer first, Dianne Morales second, and Maya Wiley third. After Stringer was accused of sexual assault, they rescinded his endorsement and issued a dual endorsement of Morales and Wiley. They then backed Wiley after Morales campaign staff alleged union busting.

====2022====

The Working Families Party set up a California chapter in January 2022, naming former San Francisco Supervisor and State Director of Bernie Sanders&#x27; 2020 presidential campaign Jane Kim as its executive director.

====2023====

Councilmember Kendra Brooks won re-election in 2023 to her at-large seat on Philadelphia City Council, and in the same election, Working Families Party candidate Nicolas O&#x27;Rourke secured the other of the two at-large seats reserved for minority party members on Philadelphia City Council, bringing the total of Working Families Party members on Philadelphia City Council to two.

==== 2024 ====
The party released a statement in October 2023 responding to President Biden&#x27;s address in which he reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel in their war with Hamas and subsequent invasion of Gaza. In the statement, federal affairs director Natalia Salgado expressed support for an immediate ceasefire and criticized Biden for providing Israel with military aid, stating &quot;there is no military solution to this conflict, and there never has been.&quot; In the WFP response to Biden&#x27;s State of the Union in March 2024, delivered by Nicolas O&#x27;Rourke, the party reaffirmed their opposition to the Biden administration&#x27;s policies in handling the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, calling again for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and denouncing the &quot;arrogant and extreme-right Netanyahu Regime.&quot; The party would join the larger protest vote movements targeting Biden&#x27;s re-election campaign in the Democratic primaries, with the New York chapter supporting an effort that urged voters to leave their ballots blank in the April primary; the final vote tally saw 40,000 blank ballots, 11.5% of the total vote share. In July 2024, Biden suspended his re-election campaign following concerns about his health and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. The WFP officially endorsed Harris after she became the presumptive nominee, declaring &quot;overwhelming support&quot; in the effort to prevent Donald Trump from returning to the presidency.

In the open election for California&#x27;s Class 1 U.S. Senate seat, the WFP endorsed Congresswoman Barbara Lee to succeed the late Dianne Feinstein.

<text>Eve Arnold, OBE (honorary), FRPS (honorary) (née Cohen; April 21, 1912January 4, 2012) was an American photojournalist, long-resident in the UK. She joined Magnum Photos agency in 1951, and became a full member in 1957. She was the first woman to join the agency. She frequently photographed Marilyn Monroe, including candid-style photos on the set of &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961).

==Early life and career==

Eve Arnold was born in Philadelphia, the fifth of nine children of immigrant Russian-Jewish parents, William Cohen (born Velvel Sklarski), a rabbi, and his wife, Bessie (Bosya Laschiner). Both of Arnold&#x27;s parents grudgingly accepted her choice to abandon medicine to study photography. She married Arnold Schmitz (later Arnold Arnold) in 1941. Her interest in photography began in 1946 while working for Kodak at their Fair Lawn, New Jersey photo-finishing plant. Using a gifted Rolleicord, she began to photograph the city with a fresh humanitarian perspective. Over six weeks in 1948, she learned photographic skills from &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; art director Alexey Brodovitch at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Studying photography under Brodovitch, she produced a collection of photos from Harlem&#x27;s vivid fashion show scene. The collection was published the series in the London Illustrated &quot;Picture Post&quot; in 1951. Although the series launched her career, she later wrote in a diary entry that the editor of the magazine changed her captions and reversed the message of her photographs to fit a racist narrative. She then became interested in African American migrant workers suffering housing discrimination in Long Island. She became the first woman to join the Magnum Agency, becoming a full member in 1957. Arnold spent time covering Republican Party press events, the McCarthy hearings, and explored the subject of birth which was taboo. She was well aware of the underrepresentation of women photojournalists and the position of women celebrities in the public eye. Arnold explored these ideas about women in her full length photo book &quot;The Unretouched Woman&quot; which was published in 1976.

Arnold&#x27;s images of Marilyn Monroe on the set of &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961) were perhaps her most memorable, but she had taken many photos of Monroe from 1951 onwards. The intimate candid-style photos achieve Arnold&#x27;s goal to show Monroe&#x27;s anxieties about being the subject of constant media attention. She befriended Monroe, Joan Crawford, and many other subjects in order to write about them and photograph them better. Her previously unseen photos of Monroe were shown at a Halcyon Gallery exhibition in London during May 2005. Travel characterized much of Arnold&#x27;s work, as she took interest in photographing the Civil rights and Black power movements in the United States as well as in the rigid Soviet Union and in China. Arnold always strived to go deeper with her photography; she even returned from some shoots with cigarette burns on her clothing from a disapproving crowd. She produced a film in 1971, &quot;Women Behind the Veil&quot;, focusing on Arabian harems and hammams.

She also photographed famous figures such as Queen Elizabeth II, Malcolm X, Marlene Dietrich, and Joan Crawford, and traveled around the world, photographing in China, Russia, South Africa and Afghanistan. Arnold left the United States and moved permanently to England in the early 1970s with her son, Francis Arnold. Several of her famous photographs were featured in &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Geo&quot;, &quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;Paris-Match&quot;, and &quot;Epoca&quot;. While working for the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, she began to make serious use of color photography. However, Arnold&#x27;s preference continued to be black and white. She alternated between taking glamorous photos of cinema stars and portraits of everyday life and experiences. The hardest task for Arnold was to make the mundane interesting. Her interest in &quot;the poor, the old, the underdog&quot; continued as her photos captured the gentle realness that Arnold portrays as characteristic of all humans. The relationship of trust between Arnold and her subjects is visible in the natural lighting and posing in her photographs.

==Later life==
In 1980, she had her first solo exhibition, which featured her photographic work done in China at the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. In the same year, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Magazine Photographers. In 1993, she was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, and elected Master Photographer by New York&#x27;s International Center of Photography. Arnold was one of only five women in the catalogued touring exhibition Magna Brava. Rejected as a Vietnam War photographer, she found photographing South African shanty towns also critiqued and drew awareness to the injustices in the world. She also photographed disabled veterans, herders in Mongolia, and women in brothels.

In 1960, Arnold did a series of portraits of American First Ladies including Jackie Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, and Pat Nixon. In 1997, she was appointed a member of the Advisory Committee of the National Media Museum (formerly the Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television) in Bradford, West Yorkshire. She was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2003.

She lived in Mayfair for many years until her last illness, when she moved to a nursing home in St George&#x27;s Square, Pimlico. When Anjelica Huston asked if she was still doing photography, Arnold replied: &quot;That&#x27;s over. I can&#x27;t hold a camera any more.&quot; She said she spent most of her time reading such writers as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann and Leo Tolstoy. One of her last photos is of her grandson when he came to visit her for a photography lesson in 1994. She describes in her diary entry of that day the bond between photographer, subject, and camera that is necessary for a portrait. She continued to stress her style of simplicity in photos with natural lighting and lack of posing and embellishments. She sums up &quot;curiosity&quot; as a one-word description of her driving force that led to her career of which was described as a friend as &quot;a one-woman cultural exchange&quot;.

==Death==
Arnold died in London on January 4, 2012, aged 99.

<doc id="938561" wikidata="Q1889778" url="?curid=938561" title="Trophoblast">
<text>The trophoblast (from Greek : to feed; and : germinator) is the outer layer of cells of the blastocyst. Trophoblasts are present four days after fertilization in humans. They provide nutrients to the embryo and develop into a large part of the placenta. They form during the first stage of pregnancy and are the first cells to differentiate from the fertilized egg to become extraembryonic structures that do not directly contribute to the embryo. After blastulation, the trophoblast is contiguous with the ectoderm of the embryo and is referred to as the trophectoderm. After the first differentiation, the cells in the human embryo lose their totipotency because they can no longer form a trophoblast. They become pluripotent stem cells.

== Structure ==

The trophoblast proliferates and differentiates into two cell layers at approximately six days after fertilization for humans.

== Function ==
Trophoblasts are specialized cells of the placenta that play an important role in embryo implantation and interaction with the decidualized maternal uterus. The core of placental villi contain mesenchymal cells and placental blood vessels that are directly connected to the fetus’ circulation via the umbilical cord. This core is surrounded by two layers of trophoblasts, the cytotrophoblast and the syncytiotrophoblast. The cytotrophoblast is a layer of mono-nucleated cells that resides underneath the syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast is composed of fused cytotrophoblasts which then form a layer that covers the placental surface. The syncytiotrophoblast is in direct contact with the maternal blood that reaches the placental surface. It then facilitates the exchange of nutrients, wastes and gases between the maternal and fetal systems.

In addition, cytotrophoblasts in the tips of villi can differentiate into another type of trophoblast called the extravillous trophoblast. Extravillous trophoblasts grow out from the placenta and penetrate into the decidualized uterus. This process is essential not only for physically attaching the placenta to the mother, but also for altering the vasculature in the uterus. This alteration allows an adequate blood supply to the growing fetus as pregnancy progresses. Some of these trophoblasts even replace the endothelial cells in the uterine spiral arteries as they remodel these vessels into wide bore conduits that are independent of maternal vasoconstriction. This ensures that the fetus receives a steady supply of blood, and the placenta is not subjected to fluctuations in oxygen that could cause it damage.

==Clinical significance==
The invasion of a specific type of trophoblast (extravillous trophoblast) into the maternal uterus is a vital stage in the establishment of pregnancy. Failure of the trophoblast to invade sufficiently is important in the development of some cases of pre-eclampsia. Invasion of the trophoblast too deeply may cause conditions such as placenta accreta, placenta increta, or placenta percreta.

Gestational trophoblastic disease is a pregnancy-associated concept, forming from the villous and extravillous trophoblast cells in the placenta.

Choriocarcinoma are trophoblastic tumors that form in the uterus from villous cells.

Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are cells that can regenerate and they are similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the fact that they come from early on in the trophoblast lifetime. In the placenta, these stem cells are able to differentiate into any trophoblast cell because they are pluripotent.

<doc id="938563" wikidata="Q300123" url="?curid=938563" title="AV nodal reentrant tachycardia">
<text>AV-nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is a type of abnormal fast heart rhythm. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), meaning that it originates from a location within the heart above the bundle of His. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common regular supraventricular tachycardia. It is more common in women than men (approximately 75% of cases occur in females). The main symptom is palpitations. Treatment may be with specific physical maneuvers, medications, or, rarely, synchronized cardioversion. Frequent attacks may require radiofrequency ablation, in which the abnormally conducting tissue in the heart is destroyed.

AVNRT occurs when a reentrant circuit forms within or just next to the atrioventricular node. The circuit usually involves two anatomical pathways: the fast pathway and the slow pathway, which are both in the right atrium. The slow pathway (which is usually targeted for ablation) is located inferior and slightly posterior to the AV node, often following the anterior margin of the coronary sinus. The fast pathway is usually located just superior and posterior to the AV node. These pathways are formed from tissue that behaves very much like the AV node, and some authors regard them as &quot;part of&quot; the AV node.

The fast and slow pathways should not be confused with the accessory pathways that give rise to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW syndrome) or atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). In AVNRT, the fast and slow pathways are located within the right atrium close to or within the AV node and exhibit electrophysiologic properties similar to AV nodal tissue. Accessory pathways that give rise to WPW syndrome and AVRT are located in the atrioventricular valvular rings. They provide a direct connection between the atria and ventricles, and have electrophysiologic properties similar to muscular heart tissue of the heart&#x27;s ventricles.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptom of AVNRT is the sudden development of rapid regular palpitations. These palpitations may be associated with a fluttering sensation in the neck, caused by near-simultaneous contraction of the atria and ventricles against a closed tricuspid valve leading to the pressure or atrial contraction being transmitted backwards into the venous system. The rapid heart rate may lead to feelings of anxiety, and may therefore be mistaken for panic attacks. In some cases, the onset of the fast heart is associated with a brief drop in blood pressure. When this happens, someone may experience dizziness or rarely lose consciousness (faint). Someone with underlying coronary artery disease (narrowing of the arteries of the heart by atherosclerosis) who has a very rapid heart rate may experience chest pain similar to angina; this pain is band- or pressure-like around the chest and often radiates to the left arm and angle of the left jaw.

Symptoms often occur without any specific trigger, although some find that their palpitations often occur after lifting heavy items or bending forwards. The onset of palpitations is sudden, with the acceleration of the heart rate occurring within a single beat, and may be preceded by a feeling of the heart skipping a beat. The heart may continue to race for minutes or hours, but the eventual termination of the arrhythmia is as rapid as its onset.

During AVNRT the heart rate is typically between 140 and 280 beats per minute. Close inspection of the neck may reveal pulsation of the jugular vein in the form of &quot;cannon A-waves&quot; as the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve.

== Mechanisms ==

The fundamental mechanism of AVNRT is a presence of a dual atrioventricular node physiology (present in half of the population), which acts as a re-entrant circuit within the atrioventricular node. This can take several forms. &quot;Typical&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, or &quot;slow-fast&quot; AVNRT uses the slow AV nodal pathway to conduct towards the ventricle (the anterograde limb of the circuit) and the fast AV nodal pathway to conduct to the atria (the retrograde limb). The re-entrant circuit can be reversed such that the fast AV nodal pathway is the anterograde limb and the slow AV nodal pathway is the retrograde limb, referred to as &quot;atypical&quot;, &quot;uncommon&quot;, or &quot;fast-slow&quot; AVNRT. Atypical AVNRT may also use the slow AV nodal pathway as the anterograde limb and left atrial fibres that approach the AV node from the left side of the inter-atrial septum as the retrograde limb, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;slow-slow&quot; AVNRT.

===Typical AVNRT===
In typical AVNRT, the anterograde conduction is via the slow pathway and the retrograde conduction is via the fast pathway (&quot;slow-fast&quot; AVNRT).

Because the retrograde conduction is via the fast pathway, stimulation of the atria (which produces the inverted P wave) occurs very soon after stimulation of the ventricles (which causes the QRS complex). As a result, the time from the QRS complex to the P wave (the RP interval) is short, less than 50% of the time between consecutive QRS complexes. The RP interval is often so short that the inverted P waves may not be seen on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) as they are buried within or immediately after the QRS complexes, appearing as a &quot;pseudo R prime&quot; wave in lead V1 or a &quot;pseudo S&quot; wave in the inferior leads.

===Atypical AVNRT===
In atypical AVNRT, the anterograde conduction is via the fast pathway and the retrograde conduction is via the slow pathway (&quot;fast-slow&quot; AVNRT).

Multiple slow pathways can exist so that both anterograde and retrograde conduction are over slow pathways. (&quot;slow-slow&quot; AVNRT).Because the retrograde conduction is via the slow pathway, stimulation of the atria will be delayed by the slow conduction tissue and will typically produce an inverted P wave that falls after the QRS complex on the surface ECG.

==Diagnosis==
If the symptoms are present while the person is receiving medical care (e.g., in an emergency department), an ECG may show typical changes that confirm the diagnosis i.e., QRS duration &lt;120 ms, unless a heart block is suspected. If the palpitations are recurrent, a doctor may request a Holter monitor (portable, wearable ECG recorder). Again, this will show the diagnosis if the recorder is attached at the time of the symptoms. In rare cases, disabling but infrequent episodes of palpitations may require the insertion of a small device under the skin that continuously record heart activity (an implantable loop recorder). All these ECG-based technologies also enable the distinction between AVNRT and other abnormal fast heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and tachyarrhythmias related to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, all of which may have symptoms that are similar to AVNRT.

Blood tests commonly performed in people with palpitations are:
* thyroid function tests (TFTs) – an overactive thyroid increases the risk of AVNRT
* electrolytes – disturbances in potassium, calcium and magnesium may predispose to AVNRT
* cardiac markers – if there is a concern that myocardial infarction (heart attack) has occurred either as a cause or as a result of the AVNRT; this is usually only the case if the patient has experienced chest pain

==Treatment==
Treatments for AVNRT aim to terminate episodes of tachycardia, and to prevent further episodes from occurring in the future. These treatments include physical manoeuvres, medication, and invasive procedures such as ablation.

=== Arrhythmia termination ===
An episode of supraventricular tachycardia due to AVNRT can be terminated by any action that transiently blocks the AV node. Some of those with AVNRT may be able to stop their attack by using physical manoeuvres that increase the activity of the vagus nerve on the heart, specifically on the atrioventricular node. These manoeuvres include carotid sinus massage (pressure on the carotid sinus in the neck) and the Valsalva manoeuvre (increasing the pressure in the chest by attempting to exhale against a closed airway by bearing down or holding one&#x27;s breath).
Medications that slow or briefly halt electrical conduction through the AV node can terminate AVNRT, including adenosine, beta blockers, or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem). Both adenosine and beta blockers may cause tightening of the airways, and are therefore used with caution in people who are known to have asthma. Less commonly used drugs for this purpose include antiarrhythmic drugs such as flecainide or amiodarone.

If the fast heart rate is poorly tolerated (e.g. the development of heart failure symptoms, low blood pressure or coma) then AVNRT can be terminated electrically using a cardioversion. In this procedure, after administering a strong sedative or general anaesthetic, an electric shock is applied to the heart to restore a normal rhythm.

=== Arrhythmia prevention ===
While preventative treatment may be very helpful at stopping the unpleasant symptoms associated with AVNRT, as this arrhythmia is a benign condition, preventative treatment is not essential. Some of those who choose not to have further treatment will eventually become asymptomatic. Those who wish to have further treatment can choose to take long term antiarrhythmic medication. The first line drugs are calcium channel antagonists and beta blockers, with second line agents including flecainide, amiodarone, and occasionally digoxin. These drugs are moderately effective at preventing further episodes but need to be taken long term.

Alternatively, an invasive procedure called an electrophysiology (EP) study and catheter ablation can be used to confirm the diagnosis and potentially offer a cure. This procedure involves introducing wires or catheters into the heart through a vein in the leg. The tip of one of these catheters can be used to heat or freeze the slow pathway of the AV node, destroying its ability to conduct electrical impulses, and preventing AVNRT. The risks and benefits are weighed up before this is performed. Catheter ablation of the slow pathway, if successfully carried out, can potentially cure AVNRT with success rates of &gt;95%, balanced against a small risk of complications including damaging the AV node and subsequently requiring a pacemaker.

<doc id="938564" wikidata="Q1152663" url="?curid=938564" title="Journey Back to Oz">
<text>Journey Back To Oz is a 1972 American animated adventure musical fantasy film produced by Filmation. Although L. Frank Baum received no screen credit, the film is loosely based on his second novel &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904). While a commercial flop in theaters, the film received a better reception on television, premiering December 5, 1976 on ABC.

For television broadcast, Filmation produced live-action interstitial segments with a celebrity playing the Wizard, flying in his balloon with two Munchkins. Filmation contracted with Bill Cosby for two airings of the live-action segments, while Milton Berle was cast for the live-action interstitials used in subsequent syndication.

==Plot==
After a tornado in Kansas causes a loose gate to knock Dorothy unconscious, she awakes in the Land of Oz with Toto, and encounters a talking Signpost (voiced by Jack E. Leonard), whose three signs point in different directions, all marked &quot;Emerald City&quot;. They later meet Pumpkinhead (voiced by Paul Lynde), the unwilling servant of antagonist Mombi – cousin of the deceased Wicked Witches of the East and West. Toto chases a cat to a small cottage where Dorothy is captured by Mombi&#x27;s pet crow (voiced by Mel Blanc) and Mombi (voiced by Ethel Merman) herself. Pumpkinhead sneaks into the house in Mombi&#x27;s absence, and discovers her creation of green elephants, to use as her army to conquer the Emerald City. Pumpkinhead frees Dorothy, and they flee. After finding Dorothy gone, Mombi threatens that their warning the Scarecrow will not help when her green elephants &quot;come crashing through the gate&quot;.

Dorothy and Pumpkinhead acquire Woodenhead Stallion III (voiced by Herschel Bernardi), a former merry-go-round horse (a combination of the Sawhorse from &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; and the title character of the last Oz book of all, &quot;Merry Go Round in Oz&quot;), who takes them to the Emerald City, where Dorothy warns the Scarecrow (voiced by Mickey Rooney) about Mombi&#x27;s green elephants. Mombi arrives moments later, and Toto and the Scarecrow are captured. Dorothy, Pumpkinhead, and Woodenhead flee to Tinland to convince the Tin Man (voiced by Danny Thomas, who spoke, and Larry Storch, who sang) to help them. He declines upon learning of the green elephants and suggests that they ask the Cowardly Lion (voiced by Milton Berle), who promises to slay the elephants, but he also declines when informed of the elephants being made with magic and suggests consulting Glinda the Good Witch (voiced by Rise Stevens), who appears to them with a &quot;Glinda Bird&quot; that uses its Tattle Tail to show what is occurring at the palace. She also admits she cannot help Dorothy fight Mombi, telling Dorothy that self-faith is the only thing she needs. As Dorothy understands this, Glinda then gives her a little silver box of &quot;countermagic&quot;, to open only in the Emerald City, and only in a dire emergency.

Mombi, having seen their progress in her crystal ball, brings the nearby trees to life; whereupon Glinda sends a golden hatchet to Pumpkinhead. One of the trees snatches it from him, but changes its fellows and itself into gold and turns them from bad to good. Woodenhead carries Dorothy and Pumpkinhead back to the Emerald City, where Mombi&#x27;s elephants surprise them. When Dorothy opens Glinda&#x27;s box, mice emerge, scaring the elephants. Mombi brews a potion to shrink Toto to mouse-size so she can feed him to her cat; but when startled, miniaturizes her crow and cat instead. Thereafter Mombi disguises herself as a rose with poisonous thorns, but Toto goads the elephants into fatally trampling over her, causing them to disappear, to which the Scarecrow explains that Mombi&#x27;s death has caused all her magic to die with her. Unfortunately, Pumpkinhead, another product of Mombi, also dies; however, he is revived by one of Dorothy&#x27;s tears.

The Scarecrow makes Woodenhead the head of the Oz cavalry and knights Pumpkinhead; and Dorothy and Toto leave Oz by another tornado (created by Pumpkinhead and Glinda), promising to return.

==Production history==
Production of &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; began in 1962, but Filmation ran out of money and the unfinished film was shelved for nearly eight years. It was only after the Filmation studio had made profits on their numerous television series that it was finally able to complete the project, copyrighted 1971, released in 1972 in the UK and 1974 in the U.S. The film features Liza Minnelli as the voice of Dorothy (played in the 1939 film by her mother Judy Garland, and in what would have been her first major role had the film been released as originally intended). Other voices were by Mickey Rooney (a former co-star and lifelong friend of Garland&#x27;s), Milton Berle, Ethel Merman, Paul Lynde, Herschel Bernardi, Paul Ford, Danny Thomas, Margaret Hamilton (also from the 1939 film, but now playing Aunt Em instead of the Wicked Witch of the West), and Metropolitan Opera mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens as Glinda the Good Witch.

For the film&#x27;s U.S. release, Filmation partnered with a company called Seymour Borde and distributed it through a process called four wall distribution, whereupon the studio rented venues to show it and kept all of the box-office revenue. Outside the United States and Canada, Warner Bros. distributed the film.

==Music==
The film contains twelve original songs by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. The arrangements and some of the film&#x27;s score was by Walter Scharf. The original songs (which were featured on a soundtrack album released around the time of the film&#x27;s television release) include the following:

However, a majority of the film contains library music from other sources. One particular piece of music, heard in the opening titles, is &quot;The Awakening&quot;, a Johnny Pearson composition that was recorded in 1967 (three years after production on this film began). While largely familiar to U.S. audiences for its use in this film, it is otherwise known to British viewers as the theme for ITN&#x27;s &quot;News at Ten&quot;. Coincidentally, another well-known Pearson composition, &quot;Heavy Action&quot; (also known as the theme of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;), served as the theme to the syndicated SFM Holiday Network, which ran this film for many years.

==Television broadcast==
While &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; was a financial failure in its original theatrical release, the film eventually found an audience through repeated television broadcast. When Filmation sold the television rights to ABC in 1976, Bill Cosby was in the midst of success with both the Filmation series &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, and starring in the new &quot;Cos&quot; variety series for ABC. Filmation decided to expand and reformat the film to a Christmas television special. The film&#x27;s theatrical running time was extended to include new live-action connecting segments with Cosby as the Wizard, a character otherwise not seen in the original theatrical release. The live-action subplot involved two lost Munchkins, Sprig and Twig, trying to get home to spend Christmas with Dorothy, while helping to move the plot along. This extended TV version would later air in a successful syndication run via the aforementioned SFM Holiday Network. The last known broadcast of this Christmas version was in 1984 and has not been available since. SFM also produced another television version minus the holiday tie-in for broadcast during the rest of the year. New live-action sequences for this version were filmed featuring cast member Milton Berle, replacing the Bill Cosby segments.

A special edition DVD was released on October 24, 2006. This DVD features a feature-length audio commentary, interviews with creators Lou Scheimer, Hal Sutherland and Fred Ladd, behind the scenes photo gallery, image galleries featuring poster art and animation cels, a sing-a-long feature, most of the Bill Cosby interstitials used in the TV version (presented separately from the original theatrical version contained on the disc and sourced from an incomplete PAL transfer of the TV version, as a complete version of the latter cut was unavailable), the first draft script and storyboards, and a photo gallery (mostly containing behind-the-scenes photos of the Cosby and Berle live-action interstitials used in syndicated broadcasts).

The theatrical version is known only to exist as a PAL digital transfer (sped up 4% from its original film speed) as the original film elements were apparently discarded and purposely destroyed by the previous owner of the film, Hallmark Entertainment.

<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics, seven track cycling events were contested, all for men only. The weather was poor, with rainfall causing the track to flood on occasion. The track was long (being built around the perimeter of the White City Stadium&#x27;s athletics track); some events (the 660 yards and the team pursuit) used full laps of the track; the others used metric distances.

<text>The hirola (Beatragus hunteri), also called the Hunter&#x27;s hartebeest or Hunter&#x27;s antelope, is a critically endangered antelope species found as of now, only in Kenya along the border of Somalia. It was first described by the big game hunter and zoologist H.C.V. Hunter in 1888. It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Beatragus&quot;, though other species are known from the fossil record. The global hirola population is estimated at 300–500 animals and there are none in captivity. According to a document produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature &quot;the loss of the hirola would be the first extinction of a mammalian genus on mainland Africa in modern human history&quot;.

==Description==

The hirola is a medium-sized antelope, tan to rufous-tawny in colour with slightly lighter under parts, predominantly white inner ears and a white tail which extends down to the hocks. It has very sharp, lyrate horns which lack a basal pedicle and are ridged along three quarters of their length. As hirola age their coat darkens towards a slate grey and the number of ridges along their horns increases. Hirola have large, dark sub-orbital glands used for marking their territories and give them the name &quot;four-eyed antelope&quot;. They have white spectacles around their eyes and an inverted white chevron running between the eyes. The horns, hooves, udders, nostrils, lips and ear tips are black. Males and females look similar although males are slightly larger with thicker horns and darker coats.

Several sources have recorded precise measurements from both captive and wild hirola. The following are maximum and minimum values taken from all sources: height at the shoulder: , body weight: , head and body length: , horn length: , horn spread (greatest outside width): , tail length: , ear length: . It is not stated whether horn length was measured direct from base to tip or along the curve of the horn. There is no data on how long hirola live in the wild but in captivity they have been known to live for 15 years.

==Taxonomy==
Authorities agree that the hirola belongs in the subfamily Alcelaphinae within the family Bovidae but there has been debate about the genus in which it should be placed. The Alcelaphinae contains hartebeest, wildebeest and topi, korrigum, bontebok, blesbok, tiang and tsessebe.

When it was first described the hirola was given the common name Hunter&#x27;s hartebeest. Despite this it was placed in the genus &quot;Damaliscus&quot; with the topi and given the scientific name &quot;Damaliscus hunteri&quot;. Newer theories have classified it as a subspecies of the topi (&quot;Damaliscus lunatus hunteri&quot;) or placed it within its own genus as &quot;Beatragus hunteri&quot;.

Recent genetic analyses on karyotypic and mitochondrial DNA support the theory that the hirola is distinct from the topi and should be placed in its own genus. They also indicate that the hirola is in fact more closely related to &quot;Alcelaphus&quot; than to &quot;Damaliscus&quot;. Placing the hirola in its own genus is further supported by behavioural observations. Neither &quot;Alcelaphus&quot; nor &quot;Damaliscus&quot; engage in flehmen, where the male tastes the urine of the female to determine oestrus. They are the only genera of bovids to have lost this behaviour. Hirola still engage in flehmen although it is less obvious than in other species.

The genus &quot;Beatragus&quot; originated around 3.1 million years ago and was once widespread with fossils found in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Tanzania and South Africa.

==Ecology==
The hirola is adapted to arid environments with annual rainfall averaging . Their habitats range from open grassland with light bush to wooded savannahs with low shrubs and scattered trees, most often on sandy soils. Despite the arid environments they inhabit, hirola appear to be able to survive independently of surface water. Andanje observed hirola drinking on only 10 occasions in 674 observations (1.5%) and all 10 observations of drinking occurred at the height of the dry season. Hirola do however favour short green grass and in 392 of 674 observations (58%) hirola were grazing on growths of short green grass around waterholes. This association with waterholes may have led to reports that hirola are dependent on surface water.

Hirola are primarily grazers but browse may be important in the dry season. They favour grasses with a high leaf to stem ratio and &quot;Chloris&quot; and &quot;Digitaria&quot; species are believed to be important in their diet. Kingdon does not consider the ecological requirements of the hirola unusual and in fact considers them to be more generalist than either &quot;Connochaetes&quot; spp. or &quot;Damaliscus&quot;. A vet who examined the digestive tract of several hirola concluded that they were well adapted to eating dry region grasses and roughage. They feed on the dominant grasses of the region and Kingdon (1982) believes that quantity is more important than quality in the hirola&#x27;s diet.

Hirola are often found in association with other species, particularly oryx, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, Burchell&#x27;s zebra and topi. They avoid Coke&#x27;s hartebeest, African buffalo, and elephant. Whilst hirola avoid direct association with livestock, they reportedly prefer the short grass in areas where livestock have grazed.

==Social structure and reproduction==

Female hirola give birth alone and may remain separate from the herd for up to two months, making them vulnerable to predation. Eventually the female will rejoin a nursery herd consisting of females and their young. Nursery herds number from 5 to 40 although the mean herd size is 7-9. They are usually accompanied by an adult male.


Young hirola leave the nursery herd at around nine months of age and form various temporary associations. They may gather together in mixed or single sex herds of up to three individuals; sub-adult or subordinate adult males may form bachelor herds of 2-38 individuals; female sub-adults may join an adult male and; if no other hirola are present, young hirola may attach themselves to a herd of Grant&#x27;s gazelles or simply spend most of their time alone.

Adult males attempt to secure a territory on good pasture. These territories are up to and are marked with dung, secretions from the sub-orbital glands and by stamping grounds where males scrape the soil with their hooves and slash the vegetation with their horns. It has been suggested that at low population densities adult males abandon territory defence and will instead follow a nursery herd. Nursery herds do not defend a territory but do have home ranges which overlap the territories of several adult males. The size of a nursery herd&#x27;s home range varies from with a mean size of .

Nursery herds are relatively stable but bachelor herds are very unstable with a fission fusion dynamic. In the 1970s hirola were observed forming aggregations of up to 300 individuals to take advantage of scarce, but spatially clumped, resources during the dry season. Information is lacking on male territoriality and how it relates to mating success, how and when hirola join a herd and how new herds are established.

Hirola are seasonal breeders with young being born from September to November. Data on age of sexual maturity and gestation period are not available for wild hirola however in captivity gestation was around 7.5 months (227–242 days) with one female mating at 1.4 years old and giving birth at 1.9 years. Another pair of hirola mated when they were 1.7 years of age. In captivity one of the main causes of mortality is wounds caused by intra-hirola aggression, including aggression between females.

==Threats==

The reasons for the historic decline of the hirola are not known but is likely a combination of factors including disease (particularly rinderpest), hunting, severe drought, predation, competition for food and water from domestic livestock and habitat loss caused by woody plant encroachment as a result of the extirpation of elephants within its range.

This hartebeest prefers areas that are used by livestock which puts them at increased risk from diseases like tuberculosis. It might be vulnerable to poaching, and is also subject to the natural phenomena of predation and competition with other wild herbivores, particularly topi and Coke&#x27;s hartebeest, which the IUCN also calls &#x27;threats&#x27;.

==Population size and distribution==

The hirola&#x27;s natural range is an area of no more than on the Kenyan-Somali border, but there is also a translocated population in Tsavo East National Park. The natural population in the 1970s was likely to number 10,000–15,000 individuals but there was an 85–90% decline between 1983 and 1985. A survey in 1995 and 1996 estimated the population to number between 500 and 2,000 individuals with 1,300 as the most reasonable estimate. A 2010 survey estimated a population of 402–466 hirola.

A translocated population was established in Kenya&#x27;s Tsavo East National Park with translocations in 1963 and 1996 (Hofmann, 1996; Andanje &amp; Ottichilo, 1999; Butynski, 1999; East, 1999). The 1963 translocation released 30 animals and the first survey in December 1995 concluded that there were at least 76 hirola present in Tsavo at the time. Eight months later a further 29 translocated hirola were released in to Tsavo, at least six of which were pregnant at the time (Andanje, 1997). By December 2000 the hirola population in Tsavo had returned to 77 individuals (Andanje, 2002) and by 2011 the population was estimated at 76 individuals.

In 2013, 9 individuals from 7 different herds were fitted with GPS-collars, scheduled to drop-off in June 2014, in north-eastern Kenya. This marked the first time that the species was GPS-collared in the wild. These collaring events served as a purpose to understand the basic ecology, the natural history, movements patterns and population demographics of the species.

==Status and conservation==

Hirola are critically endangered and their numbers continue to decline in the wild. There are between 300–500 individuals in the wild and none currently in captivity.

Despite being one of the rarest antelopes, conservation measures for the antelope have so far been marginal. The Arawale National Reserve was created in 1973 as a small sanctuary for them, but has been left unmaintained since the 1980s. In 2005, four local communities in the Ijara District, in collaboration with Terra Nuova, established the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy. As of 2014, a predator-proof fenced sanctuary has been constructed at Ishaqbini and a founding population of 48 hirola is breeding well within the sanctuary.
